''Byronia'', with the type species ''[[Ilex polypyrena]]''\n* ''Ilex'' subg. ''Prinos'', with 12 species\n* ''Ilex'' subg. ''Ilex'', with the rest of the species\n\nThe genus is widespread throughout the [[temperate]] and [[subtropical]] regions of the world. It includes species of trees, shrubs, and climbers, with evergreen or deciduous foliage and inconspicuous flowers. Its range was more extended in the [[Tertiary]] period and many species are adapted to [[laurel forest]] habitats. It occurs from sea level to more than {{convert|2000|m}} with high mountain species. It is a genus of small, [[evergreen]] [[trees]] with smooth, glabrous, or pubescent [[branchlet]]s. The plants are generally slow-growing with some species growing to {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} tall. The [[type species]] is the European holly ''[[Ilex aquifolium]]'' described by Linnaeus.<ref name=ING>{{cite web | title = Index Nominum Genericorum | date = 2013 |url = http://botany.si.edu/ing/ |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nPlants in this genus have simple, alternate glossy leaves, frequently with a spiny leaf margin. The inconspicuous flower is greenish white, with four petals. They are generally [[dioecious]], with male and female [[flower]]s on different plants.\n\nThe small [[fruits]] of ''Ilex'', although often referred to as [[berries]], are technically [[drupes]].<ref>{{cite web | title = ''Kew Plants and Fungi'' | url = http://www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Ilex-aquifolium.htm | date = 2012-04-11 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120503152922/http://www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Ilex-aquifolium.htm | archivedate = 3 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> They range in color from red to brown to black, and rarely green or yellow. The \"bones\" contain up to ten [[seed]]s each.  Some species produce fruits [[parthenogenetic]]ally, such as the cultivar 'Nellie R. Stevens'. The fruits ripen in winter and thus provide winter colour contrast between the bright red of the fruits and the glossy green evergreen leaves.  Hence the cut branches, especially of ''I. aquifolium'', are widely used in Christmas decoration. The fruits are generally slightly [[poison|toxic]] to humans, and can cause [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]] when ingested. However, they are an important food source for birds and other animals, which help disperse the seeds.  Unfortunately this can have negative impacts as well.  Along the west coast of North America, from California to British Columbia, English holly (''Ilex aquifolium''), which is grown commercially, is quickly spreading into native forest habitat, where it thrives in shade and crowds out native species.  It has been placed on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board's monitor list, and is a Class C invasive plant in Portland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nwcb.wa.gov/detail.asp?weed=152|title=Noxious Weed Control Board (NWCB) - WA State - Weed Detail Page|website=wa.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726075839/http://www.nwcb.wa.gov/detail.asp?weed=152|archivedate=26 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bcinvasives.ca/invasive-species/identify/invasive-species/invasive-plants/english-holly/|title=English Holly|website=Invasive Species Week|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906192403/http://bcinvasives.ca/invasive-species/identify/invasive-species/invasive-plants/english-holly/|archivedate=6 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/management/plant_profiles/Ilex_aquifolium.php|title=Cal-IPC: Ilex aquifolium|website=cal-ipc.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605124004/http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/management/plant_profiles/Ilex_aquifolium.php|archivedate=5 June 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>https://www.portlandoregon.gov/auditor/34460?a=322280</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ilex'' in Latin means the holm-oak or evergreen oak (''[[Quercus ilex]]'').

In this scenario ancestors of this group became isolated from the remaining ''Ilex'' when the Earth mass broke away into [[Gondwana]] and [[Laurasia]] about 82{{nbsp}}million years ago, resulting in a physical separation of the groups and beginning a process of change to adapt to new conditions. This mechanism is called [[allopatric speciation]]. Over time, survivor species of the holly genus adapted to different ecological niches. This led to [[reproductive isolation]], an example of [[ecological speciation]]. In the [[Pliocene]], around five million years ago, [[orogeny|mountain formation]] diversified the landscape and provided new opportunities for speciation within the genus.\n\nThe [[fossil record]] indicates that the ''Ilex'' lineage was already widespread prior to the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period. Based on the [[molecular clock]], the common ancestor of most of the extant species probably appeared during the [[Eocene]], about 50{{nbsp}}million years ago, suggesting that older representatives of the genus belong to now extinct branches.<ref name=\"Loizeau\">{{cite book|last=Loizeau|first=P.-A. |author2=Barriera G. |author3=Manen J.-F. |author4=Broennimann O. |title=Plant diversity and complexity patterns: local, regional, and global dimensions : proceedings of an international symposium held at the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters in Copenhagen, Denmark, 25\u201328 May 2003|editor=Friis I. |editor2=Balslev H.|publisher=Kongelige Danske videnskabernes selskab|year=2005|series=Biologiske skrifter|volume=55|pages=507\u2013517|chapter=Towards an understanding of ''Ilex'' L.

This type of forest extended during the [[Neogene]], more than 20{{nbsp}}million years ago. Most of the last remaining temperate broadleaf evergreen forests are believed to have disappeared about 10,000 years ago at the end of the [[Pleistocene]]. Many of the then-existing species with the strictest ecological requirements became extinct because they could not cross the barriers imposed by the geography, but others found refuge as a species [[relict]] in coastal enclaves, archipelagos, and coastal mountains sufficiently far from areas of extreme cold and aridity and protected by the oceanic influence.\n\nSpeaking of Holly, SLUH had a teacher within their English department named Hollice \u201cHolly\u201d Hein, circa 1994.  One of her students Ken Watts would occasionally misinterpret scenes from \u201cThe Lord of the Flies\u201d as being sexual and get all silly as he shared his thoughts to Ms. Hein.  Holly would remark, \u201cLet\u2019s not entertain such thoughts, Ken.\u201d  Unrelated to this whole Ken guy, a guy named Ryan Kelly sat towards the front and would raise his hand in a claw-like fist any time he wanted to speak.  It was weird and an uncomfortable class to be in.\n\n==Range==\nThe genus is distributed throughout the world's different climates. Most species make their home in the [[tropics]] and [[subtropic]]s, with a worldwide distribution in [[temperate zone]]s.

''[[Ilex canariensis]]'', from [[Macaronesia]], and ''Ilex aquifolium'' arose from a common ancestor in the [[laurisilva|laurel forests]] of the Mediterranean. Australia, isolated at an early period, has (''[[Ilex arnhemensis]]''). Of 204 species growing in China, 149 species are [[endemism|endemic]]. A species which stands out for its economic importance in Spanish-speaking countries and in Brazil is ''[[Ilex paraguariensis]]'' or ''Yerba mate''. Having [[evolution|evolved]] numerous species that are [[endemism|endemic]] to islands and small mountain ranges, and being highly useful plants, many hollies are now becoming rare.\n\n==Ecology==\nOften the [[tropical]] species are especially threatened by [[habitat destruction]] and [[overexploitation]]. At least two species of ''Ilex'' have become extinct recently, and many others are barely surviving.<ref Name=iucn>[[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) (2007): 2007 ''IUCN Red List of Threatened Species'': ''Ilex'']</ref>\n\nThey are extremely important food for numerous species of birds, and also are eaten by other wild animals. In the autumn and early winter the fruits are hard and apparently unpalatable. After being frozen or frosted several times, the fruits soften, and become milder in taste. During winter [[storm]]s, [[bird]]s often take refuge in hollies, which provide shelter, protection from [[predator]]s (by the spiny leaves), and [[food]]. The flowers are sometimes eaten by the [[larva]] of the [[double-striped pug]] [[moth]] (''Gymnoscelis rufifasciata''). Other [[Lepidoptera]] whose larvae feed on holly include ''[[Bucculatrix ilecella]]'', which feeds exclusively on hollies, and [[the engrailed]] (''Ectropis crepuscularia'').\n\n==Toxicity==\nHolly can contain [[caffeic acid]], [[caffeoyl]] derivatives, [[caffeoylshikimic acid]], [[chlorogenic acid]], [[feruloylquinic acid]], [[quercetin]], [[quinic acid]], [[kaempferol]], [[tannins]], [[rutin]],  [[caffeine]], and [[theobromine]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kellie P.

''Byronia'', with the type species ''[[Ilex polypyrena]]''\n* ''Ilex'' subg. ''Prinos'', with 12 species\n* ''Ilex'' subg. ''Ilex'', with the rest of the species\n\nThe genus is widespread throughout the [[temperate]] and [[subtropical]] regions of the world. It includes species of trees, shrubs, and climbers, with evergreen or deciduous foliage and inconspicuous flowers. Its range was more extended in the [[Tertiary]] period and many species are adapted to [[laurel forest]] habitats. It occurs from sea level to more than {{convert|2000|m}} with high mountain species. It is a genus of small, [[evergreen]] [[trees]] with smooth, glabrous, or pubescent [[branchlet]]s. The plants are generally slow-growing with some species growing to {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} tall. The [[type species]] is the European holly ''[[Ilex aquifolium]]'' described by Linnaeus.<ref name=ING>{{cite web | title = Index Nominum Genericorum | date = 2013 |url = http://botany.si.edu/ing/ |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nPlants in this genus have simple, alternate glossy leaves, frequently with a spiny leaf margin. The inconspicuous flower is greenish white, with four petals. They are generally [[dioecious]], with male and female [[flower]]s on different plants.\n\nThe small [[fruits]] of ''Ilex'', although often referred to as [[berries]], are technically [[drupes]].<ref>{{cite web | title = ''Kew Plants and Fungi'' | url = http://www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Ilex-aquifolium.htm | date = 2012-04-11 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120503152922/http://www.kew.org/plants-fungi/Ilex-aquifolium.htm | archivedate = 3 May 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> They range in color from red to brown to black, and rarely green or yellow. The \"bones\" contain up to ten [[seed]]s each.  Some species produce fruits [[parthenogenetic]]ally, such as the cultivar 'Nellie R. Stevens'. The fruits ripen in winter and thus provide winter colour contrast between the bright red of the fruits and the glossy green evergreen leaves.  Hence the cut branches, especially of ''I. aquifolium'', are widely used in Christmas decoration. The fruits are generally slightly [[poison|toxic]] to humans, and can cause [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]] when ingested. However, they are an important food source for birds and other animals, which help disperse the seeds.  Unfortunately this can have negative impacts as well.  Along the west coast of North America, from California to British Columbia, English holly (''Ilex aquifolium''), which is grown commercially, is quickly spreading into native forest habitat, where it thrives in shade and crowds out native species.  It has been placed on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board's monitor list, and is a Class C invasive plant in Portland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nwcb.wa.gov/detail.asp?weed=152|title=Noxious Weed Control Board (NWCB) - WA State - Weed Detail Page|website=wa.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726075839/http://www.nwcb.wa.gov/detail.asp?weed=152|archivedate=26 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bcinvasives.ca/invasive-species/identify/invasive-species/invasive-plants/english-holly/|title=English Holly|website=Invasive Species Week|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906192403/http://bcinvasives.ca/invasive-species/identify/invasive-species/invasive-plants/english-holly/|archivedate=6 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/management/plant_profiles/Ilex_aquifolium.php|title=Cal-IPC: Ilex aquifolium|website=cal-ipc.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605124004/http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/management/plant_profiles/Ilex_aquifolium.php|archivedate=5 June 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>https://www.portlandoregon.gov/auditor/34460?a=322280</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ilex'' in Latin means the holm-oak or evergreen oak (''[[Quercus ilex]]'').

In this scenario ancestors of this group became isolated from the remaining ''Ilex'' when the Earth mass broke away into [[Gondwana]] and [[Laurasia]] about 82{{nbsp}}million years ago, resulting in a physical separation of the groups and beginning a process of change to adapt to new conditions. This mechanism is called [[allopatric speciation]]. Over time, survivor species of the holly genus adapted to different ecological niches. This led to [[reproductive isolation]], an example of [[ecological speciation]]. In the [[Pliocene]], around five million years ago, [[orogeny|mountain formation]] diversified the landscape and provided new opportunities for speciation within the genus.\n\nThe [[fossil record]] indicates that the ''Ilex'' lineage was already widespread prior to the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period. Based on the [[molecular clock]], the common ancestor of most of the extant species probably appeared during the [[Eocene]], about 50{{nbsp}}million years ago, suggesting that older representatives of the genus belong to now extinct branches.<ref name=\"Loizeau\">{{cite book|last=Loizeau|first=P.-A. |author2=Barriera G. |author3=Manen J.-F. |author4=Broennimann O. |title=Plant diversity and complexity patterns: local, regional, and global dimensions : proceedings of an international symposium held at the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters in Copenhagen, Denmark, 25\u201328 May 2003|editor=Friis I. |editor2=Balslev H.|publisher=Kongelige Danske videnskabernes selskab|year=2005|series=Biologiske skrifter|volume=55|pages=507\u2013517|chapter=Towards an understanding of ''Ilex'' L.

This type of forest extended during the [[Neogene]], more than 20{{nbsp}}million years ago. Most of the last remaining temperate broadleaf evergreen forests are believed to have disappeared about 10,000 years ago at the end of the [[Pleistocene]]. Many of the then-existing species with the strictest ecological requirements became extinct because they could not cross the barriers imposed by the geography, but others found refuge as a species [[relict]] in coastal enclaves, archipelagos, and coastal mountains sufficiently far from areas of extreme cold and aridity and protected by the oceanic influence.\n\n==Range==\nThe genus is distributed throughout the world's different climates. Most species make their home in the [[tropics]] and [[subtropic]]s, with a worldwide distribution in [[temperate zone]]s.

In the autumn and early winter the fruits are hard and apparently unpalatable. After being frozen or frosted several times, the fruits soften, and become milder in taste. During winter [[storm]]s, [[bird]]s often take refuge in hollies, which provide shelter, protection from [[predator]]s (by the spiny leaves), and [[food]]. The flowers are sometimes eaten by the [[larva]] of the [[double-striped pug]] [[moth]] (''Gymnoscelis rufifasciata'').
