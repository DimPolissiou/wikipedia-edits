[[John J. Pershing]], 1917.]]\n[[President Woodrow Wilson]] initially planned to give command of the AEF to Gen. [[Frederick Funston]], but after Funston's sudden death, Wilson appointed Major General [[John J. Pershing]] in May 1917, and Pershing remained in command for the entire war. Pershing insisted that American soldiers be well-trained before going to Europe. As a result, few troops arrived before January 1918. In addition, Pershing insisted that the American force would not be used merely to fill gaps in the French and British armies, and he resisted European efforts to have U.S. troops deployed as individual replacements in decimated [[Allies of World War I|Allied units]]. \nThis approach was not always well received by the western Allied leaders who distrusted the potential of an army lacking experience in large-scale warfare.<ref name=\"Coffman1998\">Coffman, ''The War to End All Wars'' (1998)</ref> In addition, the [[British Empire]] tried to bargain with its spare shipping to make the United States put its soldiers into British ranks.\n\n[[File:The US Army in Britain, 1917-1918 Q30005.jpg|thumb|left|Column of American troops passing Buckingham Palace, London, 1917.]]\nBy June 1917, only 14,000 American soldiers had arrived in France, and the AEF had only a minor participation at the front through late October 1917, but by May 1918 over one million American troops were stationed in France, though only half of them made it to the front lines.<ref>Pershing, ''[[My Experiences in the World War]]'' (1931)</ref> \nSince the [[transport ship]]s needed to bring American troops to Europe were scarce at the beginning, the U.S. Army pressed into service passenger liners, seized German ships, and borrowed Allied ships to transport American soldiers from ports in [[New York City]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Virginia]]. The mobilization effort taxed the American military to the limit and required new organizational strategies and command structures to transport great numbers of troops and supplies quickly and efficiently. The French harbors of [[Bordeaux]], [[La Pallice]], [[Saint Nazaire]], and [[Brest, France|Brest]] became the entry points into the French railway system that brought the American troops and their supplies to the Western Front. \nAmerican engineers in France also built 82 new ship berths, nearly {{convert|1000|mi|km}} of additional standard-gauge tracks, and over {{convert|100000|mi|km}} of telephone and telegraph lines.<ref name=\"Coffman1998\"/>\n\nThe first American troops, who were often called \"[[Doughboy]]s\", landed in Europe in June 1917. However the AEF did not participate at the front until October 21, 1917, when the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]] fired the first American shell of the war toward German lines, although they participated only on a small scale. A group of regular soldiers and the first American division to arrive in France, entered the trenches near [[Nancy, France]], in [[Lorraine]].<ref name=\"Coffman1998\"/>\n\nThe AEF used French and British equipment. Particularly appreciated were the French [[canon de 75 mod\u00e8le 1897]], the [[canon de 155 C mod\u00e8le 1917 Schneider]], and the [[canon de 155mm GPF]]. American aviation units received the [[SPAD XIII]] and [[Nieuport 28]] fighters, and the U.S. Army tank corps used French [[Renault FT]] light tanks. Pershing established facilities in France to train new arrivals with their new weapons.<ref>Wilson, ''Treat 'Em Rough: The Birth of American Armor, 1917\u20131920'' (1989)</ref> \nBy the end of 1917, four divisions were deployed in a large training area near [[Verdun]]: the 1st Division, a regular army formation; the [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th Division]], a [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]] division; the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Division]], a combination of regular troops and [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]]; and the [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd \"Rainbow\" Division]], a National Guard division made up of soldiers from nearly every state in the United States. The fifth division, the [[41st Infantry Division (United States)|41st Division]], was converted into a depot division near [[Tours]].\n\n===Logistics===\n{{main|Services of Supply, American Expeditionary Forces}}\n[[File:Hubble identity card.jpg|left|thumb|A. E. F. officer's identity card, 1918.]]\nSupporting the two million soldiers across the Atlantic Ocean was a massive logistical enterprise. In order to be successful, the Americans needed to create a coherent support structure with very little institutional knowledge.\n\nThe AEF developed support network appropriate for the huge size of the American force. It rested upon the [[Services of Supply, American Expeditionary Forces|Services of Supply]] in the rear areas, with ports, railroads, depots, schools, maintenance facilities, bakeries, clothing repair shops (termed salvage), replacement depots, ice plants, and a wide variety of other activities.\n\nThe Services of Supply initiated support techniques that would last well into the Cold War including forward maintenance, field cooking, graves registration (mortuary affairs), host nation support, motor transport, and morale services. The work of the logisticians enabled the success of the AEF and contributed to the emergence of the American Army as a modern fighting force.<ref>Leo P.

After the first offensive action and American-led AEF victory on 28 May 1918 at the [[Battle of Cantigny]],<ref>Matthew Davenport, \"First Over There\", 2015, Thomas Dunne Books</ref> by the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 1st Division]], and a similar local action by the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Division]] at [[Battle of Belleau Wood|Belleau Wood]] beginning 6 June, both while assigned under French Corps command, Pershing worked towards the deployment of an independent US field Army. The rest followed at an accelerating pace during the spring and summer of 1918. By June Americans were arriving in-theater at the rate of 10,000 a day; most of which entered training by British, Canadian and Australian battle-experienced officers and senior non-commissioned ranks. The training took a minimum of six weeks due to the inexperience of the servicemen.\n\nThe first offensive action by AEF units serving under non-American command was 1,000 men (four companies from the [[33rd Infantry Division (United States)|33d Division]] AEF), with the [[Australian Corps]] during the [[Battle of Hamel]] on 4 July 1918. ([[Corporal]] [[Thomas A. Pope]] was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for this battle.) This battle took place under the overall command of the Australian Corps commander, Lt. Gen. Sir [[John Monash]]. The Allied force in this battle combined artillery, armor, infantry, and air support ([[Combined arms]]), which served as a blueprint for all subsequent Allied attacks, using \"[[Mark V tank|tanks]]\".<ref>Roland Perry, ''Monash \u2013 The Outsider Who Won a War'', 2007, Random House, Sydney, pp.349\u2013352</ref>\n\nU.S. Army and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] troops played a key role in helping stop the German thrust towards Paris, during the [[Second Battle of the Marne]] in June 1918 (at the [[Battle of Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry (1918)]] and the [[Battle of Belleau Wood]]). The first major and distinctly American offensive was the reduction of the Saint Mihiel salient during September 1918. During the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel]], Pershing commanded the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]], composed of seven [[division (military)|division]]s and more than 500,000 men, in the largest offensive operation ever undertaken by United States armed forces. This successful offensive was followed by the [[Meuse-Argonne offensive]], lasting from September 26 to November 11, 1918, during which Pershing commanded more than one million American and French combatants. In these two military operations, Allied forces recovered more than 200&nbsp;sq mi (488&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of French territory from the German army. By the time the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|World War I Armistice]] had suspended all combat on November 11, 1918, the American Expeditionary Forces had evolved into a modern, combat-tested army.<ref name=\"Coffman1998\"/>\n\nLate in the war, American units ultimately fought in two other theaters at the request of the European powers. Pershing sent troops of the [[332nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|332d Infantry Regiment]] to Italy, and President Wilson agreed to send some troops, the [[27th Infantry Regiment (United States)|27th]] and [[339th Infantry Regiment]]s, to Russia.<ref name =\"Venzon\">Venzon, ed.

The AEF was established on July 5, 1917, in [[France]] under the command of Gen. [[John J. Pershing]]. It fought alongside [[French Army]], [[British Army]], [[Canadian Army]], and [[Australian Army]] units against the [[Imperial German Army]]. A minority of the AEF troops also fought alongside [[Italian Army]] units in that same year against the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. The AEF helped the French Army on the Western Front during the [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Aisne Offensive]] (at the [[Battle of Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry (1918)|Battle of Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry]] and [[Battle of Belleau Wood]]) in the summer of 1918, and fought its major actions in the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel]] and the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]] in the latter part of 1918.\n<!-- EDITORS NOTE: Please do not change the first paragraph without prior consensus, see [[Talk:American Expeditionary Forces]].

[[John J. Pershing]], 1917.]]\n[[President Woodrow Wilson]] initially planned to give command of the AEF to Gen. [[Frederick Funston]], but after Funston's sudden death, Wilson appointed Major General [[John J. Pershing]] in May 1917, and Pershing remained in command for the entire war. Pershing insisted that American soldiers be well-trained before going to Europe. As a result, few troops arrived before January 1918. In addition, Pershing insisted that the American force would not be used merely to fill gaps in the French and British armies, and he resisted European efforts to have U.S. troops deployed as individual replacements in decimated [[Allies of World War I|Allied units]]. \nThis approach was not always well received by the western Allied leaders who distrusted the potential of an army lacking experience in large-scale warfare.<ref name=\"Coffman1998\">Coffman, ''The War to End All Wars'' (1998)</ref> In addition, the [[British Empire]] tried to bargain with its spare shipping to make the United States put its soldiers into British ranks.\n\n[[File:The US Army in Britain, 1917-1918 Q30005.jpg|thumb|left|Column of American troops passing Buckingham Palace, London, 1917.]]\nBy June 1917, only 14,000 American soldiers had arrived in France, and the AEF had only a minor participation at the front through late October 1917, but by May 1918 over one million American troops were stationed in France, though only half of them made it to the front lines.<ref>Pershing, ''[[My Experiences in the World War]]'' (1931)</ref> \nSince the [[transport ship]]s needed to bring American troops to Europe were scarce at the beginning, the U.S. Army pressed into service passenger liners, seized German ships, and borrowed Allied ships to transport American soldiers from ports in [[New York City]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Virginia]]. The mobilization effort taxed the American military to the limit and required new organizational strategies and command structures to transport great numbers of troops and supplies quickly and efficiently. The French harbors of [[Bordeaux]], [[La Pallice]], [[Saint Nazaire]], and [[Brest, France|Brest]] became the entry points into the French railway system that brought the American troops and their supplies to the Western Front. \nAmerican engineers in France also built 82 new ship berths, nearly {{convert|1000|mi|km}} of additional standard-gauge tracks, and over {{convert|100000|mi|km}} of telephone and telegraph lines.<ref name=\"Coffman1998\"/>\n\nThe first American troops, who were often called \"[[Doughboy]]s\", landed in Europe in June 1917. However the AEF did not participate at the front until October 21, 1917, when the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]] fired the first American shell of the war toward German lines, although they participated only on a small scale. A group of regular soldiers and the first American division to arrive in France, entered the trenches near [[Nancy, France]], in [[Lorraine]].<ref name=\"Coffman1998\"/>\n\nThe AEF used French and British equipment. Particularly appreciated were the French [[canon de 75 mod\u00e8le 1897]], the [[canon de 155 C mod\u00e8le 1917 Schneider]], and the [[canon de 155mm GPF]]. American aviation units received the [[SPAD XIII]] and [[Nieuport 28]] fighters, and the U.S. Army tank corps used French [[Renault FT]] light tanks. Pershing established facilities in France to train new arrivals with their new weapons.<ref>Wilson, ''Treat 'Em Rough: The Birth of American Armor, 1917\u20131920'' (1989)</ref> \nBy the end of 1917, four divisions were deployed in a large training area near [[Verdun]]: the 1st Division, a regular army formation; the [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th Division]], a [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]] division; the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Division]], a combination of regular troops and [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]]; and the [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd \"Rainbow\" Division]], a National Guard division made up of soldiers from nearly every state in the United States. The fifth division, the [[41st Infantry Division (United States)|41st Division]], was converted into a depot division near [[Tours]].\n\n===Logistics===\n{{main|Services of Supply, American Expeditionary Forces}}\n[[File:Hubble identity card.jpg|left|thumb|A. E. F. officer's identity card, 1918.]]\nSupporting the two million soldiers across the Atlantic Ocean was a massive logistical enterprise. In order to be successful, the Americans needed to create a coherent support structure with very little institutional knowledge.\n\nThe AEF developed support network appropriate for the huge size of the American force. It rested upon the [[Services of Supply, American Expeditionary Forces|Services of Supply]] in the rear areas, with ports, railroads, depots, schools, maintenance facilities, bakeries, clothing repair shops (termed salvage), replacement depots, ice plants, and a wide variety of other activities.\n\nThe Services of Supply initiated support techniques that would last well into the Cold War including forward maintenance, field cooking, graves registration (mortuary affairs), host nation support, motor transport, and morale services. The work of the logisticians enabled the success of the AEF and contributed to the emergence of the American Army as a modern fighting force.<ref>Leo P.

After the first offensive action and American-led AEF victory on 28 May 1918 at the [[Battle of Cantigny]],<ref>Matthew Davenport, \"First Over There\", 2015, Thomas Dunne Books</ref> by the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 1st Division]], and a similar local action by the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Division]] at [[Battle of Belleau Wood|Belleau Wood]] beginning 6 June, both while assigned under French Corps command, Pershing worked towards the deployment of an independent US field Army. The rest followed at an accelerating pace during the spring and summer of 1918. By June Americans were arriving in-theater at the rate of 10,000 a day; most of which entered training by British, Canadian and Australian battle-experienced officers and senior non-commissioned ranks. The training took a minimum of six weeks due to the inexperience of the servicemen.\n\nThe first offensive action by AEF units serving under non-American command was 1,000 men (four companies from the [[33rd Infantry Division (United States)|33d Division]] AEF), with the [[Australian Corps]] during the [[Battle of Hamel]] on 4 July 1918. ([[Corporal]] [[Thomas A. Pope]] was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for this battle.) This battle took place under the overall command of the Australian Corps commander, Lt. Gen. Sir [[John Monash]]. The Allied force in this battle combined artillery, armor, infantry, and air support ([[Combined arms]]), which served as a blueprint for all subsequent Allied attacks, using \"[[Mark V tank|tanks]]\".<ref>Roland Perry, ''Monash \u2013 The Outsider Who Won a War'', 2007, Random House, Sydney, pp.349\u2013352</ref>\n\nU.S. Army and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] troops played a key role in helping stop the German thrust towards Paris, during the [[Second Battle of the Marne]] in June 1918 (at the [[Battle of Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry (1918)]] and the [[Battle of Belleau Wood]]). The first major and distinctly American offensive was the reduction of the Saint Mihiel salient during September 1918. During the [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel]], Pershing commanded the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]], composed of seven [[division (military)|division]]s and more than 500,000 men, in the largest offensive operation ever undertaken by United States armed forces. This successful offensive was followed by the [[Meuse-Argonne offensive]], lasting from September 26 to November 11, 1918, during which Pershing commanded more than one million American and French combatants. In these two military operations, Allied forces recovered more than 200&nbsp;sq mi (488&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of French territory from the German army. By the time the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|World War I Armistice]] had suspended all combat on November 11, 1918, the American Expeditionary Forces had evolved into a modern, combat-tested army.<ref name=\"Coffman1998\"/>\n\nLate in the war, American units ultimately fought in two other theaters at the request of the European powers. Pershing sent troops of the [[332nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|332d Infantry Regiment]] to Italy, and President Wilson agreed to send some troops, the [[27th Infantry Regiment (United States)|27th]] and [[339th Infantry Regiment]]s, to Russia.<ref name =\"Venzon\">Venzon, ed.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings, and one of the main protagonists of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Frodo is a [[hobbit]] of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] who inherits the [[One Ring]] from his cousin [[Bilbo Baggins]] and undertakes the quest to destroy it in the fires of [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]]. He is mentioned in Tolkien's posthumously published works, ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. \n\nFrodo is repeatedly wounded during the quest, and becomes increasingly burdened by the Ring as it nears Mordor. He changes, too, growing in understanding and compassion, and avoiding violence.\n\nFrodo's name comes from the [[Old English]] name ''[[Froda|Fr\u00f3da]]'', meaning \"wise by experience\". Commentators have written that he combines courage, selflessness, and fidelity, and that as a good character, he seems unexciting but grows through his quest, an unheroic person who reaches heroic stature.\n\n==Internal history==\n\n===Background===\n\nIn ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the protagonist [[Bilbo Baggins]] is taken by the Wizard Gandalf and a party of [[Dwarves (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] from his safe home, [[Bag End]], in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] across the [[Misty Mountains]] and the dark forest of [[Mirkwood]] to recapture the Dwarves' ancient home and treasure under the Lonely Mountain. The treasure is guarded by a [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], [[Smaug]]. Through many adventures, Smaug is killed and Bilbo returns home with a substantial portion of the treasure. He lives the life of a rich eccentric for many years.\n\nFrodo is introduced in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as Bilbo's relative and adoptive heir. The chapter \"A Long-expected Party\" relates that Frodo's parents Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck had been killed in a boating accident when Frodo was 12; Frodo spent the next nine years living with his maternal family, the Brandybucks in Brandy Hall. At the age of 21 he was adopted by his cousin,{{efn|Although Frodo referred to Bilbo as his \"uncle\", they were in fact first ''and'' second cousins, once removed either way (his paternal great-great-uncle's son's son and his maternal great-aunt's son).}} Bilbo, who brought him to live at Bag End. He and Bilbo shared the same birthday, the 22nd of 'September'. Bilbo introduced Frodo to the [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish languages]] , and they often went on long walking trips together.<ref name=\"Party\" group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 1, \"A Long-Expected Party\"</ref>\n\n===''The Fellowship of the Ring''===\n\nFrodo comes of age as Bilbo leaves the Shire for good on his one hundred and eleventh birthday. Frodo inherits Bag End and [[One Ring|Bilbo's ring]]. [[Gandalf]], at this time, is not certain about the origin of the ring, so he warns Frodo to avoid using it and to keep it secret.<ref name=\"Party\" group=T/> Frodo keeps the Ring hidden for the next 17 years, and the Ring gives him the same longevity it gave Bilbo. Gandalf returns to prove to him that it is the One Ring of the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], who seeks to recover and use it to conquer [[Middle-earth]].<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' book 1, ch. 2, \"The Shadow of the Past\"</ref>\n\nRealizing that he is a danger to the Shire as long as he remains there with the Ring, Frodo decides to take it to [[Rivendell]], home of [[Elrond]], a mighty [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-lord. He leaves with three companions: his gardener [[Samwise Gamgee]] and his cousins [[Merry Brandybuck]] and [[Pippin Took]]. They escape just in time, for Sauron's most powerful servants, the Nine [[Nazg\u00fbl]], have entered the Shire as Black Riders, looking for Bilbo and the Ring.

It relates the unnamed speaker's journey to a mysterious land across the sea, where he tries but fails to make contact with the people who dwell there. He descends into despair and near-madness, eventually returning to his own country, to find himself utterly alienated from those he once knew.<ref name=\"Flieger2001\">{{cite book |last=Flieger |first=Verlyn |title=A Question of Time: J.R.R.

In drafts of the final chapters, published as ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'', Gandalf names Frodo ''Bronwe athan Harthad'' (\"Endurance Beyond Hope\"), after the destruction of the Ring. Tolkien states that Frodo's name in [[Westron]] was ''Maura Labingi''.<ref group=T>Tolkien, Christopher. ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Volume XII, ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', \"The Appendix on Languages\", pp. 48, 50.</ref> In ''[[The Return of the King]]'' he is also called ''Daur'', Sindarin for \"noble\".<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]</ref>\n\n==Interpretations== \n\nFrodo is the only prominent hobbit whose name is not explained in Tolkien's Appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings''. In a letter Tolkien states that it is the [[Old English]] name ''[[Froda|Fr\u00f3da]]'', connected to ''[[Germanic name#Frod|fr\u00f3d]]'', \"wise by experience\".<ref group=T>''[[Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', #168</ref> The Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] suggests that the choice of name is significant: not, in Tolkien's phrase, one of the many \"names that had no meaning at all in [the hobbits'] daily language\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}} Instead, he notes, the [[Old Norse]] name ''[[Fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]'' is mentioned in ''[[Beowulf]]'' as the minor character ''Fr\u00f3da''. ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i'' was, he writes, said by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] and [[Snorri Sturluson]] to be a peaceful ruler at the time of Christ, his time being named the ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0a-fri\u00f0'', the peace of ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i''. This was created by his magic mill, worked by two female giants, that could churn out peace and gold. He makes the giants work all day long at this task, until they rebel and grind out an army instead, which kills him and takes over, making the giants grind salt until the sea is full of it. The name ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i'' is forgotten. Clearly, Shippey observes, evil is impossible to cure; and Frodo too is a \"peacemaker, indeed in the end a [[pacifist]]\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}} And, he writes, as Frodo gains experience through the quest, he also gains wisdom, matching the meaning of his name.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}}\n\nMichael Stanton, writing in the ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'', describes Frodo's character as combining \"courage, selflessness, and fidelity\",{{sfn|Stanton|2013|pp=223\u2013225}} attributes that make Frodo ideal as a Ring-bearer. He lacks Sam's simple sturdiness, Merry and Pippin's clowning, and the [[psychopathology]] of Gollum, writes Stanton, bearing out the saying that good is less exciting than evil; but Frodo grows through his quest, becoming \"ennobled\" by it, to the extent that returning to the Shire feels in Frodo's words \"like falling asleep again\".{{sfn|Stanton|2013|pp=223\u2013225}}\n\nThe Tolkien scholar [[Jane Chance]] quotes [[Randel Helms]]'s view that in both ''The Hobbit'' and ''Lord of the Rings'', \"a most unheroic hobbit achieves heroic stature\" in a quest romance.{{sfn|Nitzsche|1980|pp=97-98}}{{sfn|Helms|1974|p=21}} Chance writes that Frodo grows from seeing the threat as external, such as from the Black Riders, to internal, whether within the Fellowship, as shown by Boromir's attempt on the Ring, or within himself, as he struggles against the controlling power of the Ring.{{sfn|Nitzsche|1980|p=99}}\n\nThe Tolkien critic [[Paul H. Kocher]] discusses the role of [[Divine providence|providence]], in the form of the intentions of the angel-like [[Valar]] or of the creator [[Eru Il\u00favatar]], in Bilbo's finding of the Ring and Frodo's bearing of it; as Gandalf says, Frodo was \"meant\" to have it, though it remains his choice to co-operate with this purpose.{{sfn|Kocher|1974|p=37}}\n\n==Adaptations==\n\nFrodo appears in adaptations of ''The Lord of the Rings'' for radio, cinema, and stage.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s writings, and one of the main protagonists of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Frodo is a [[hobbit]] of [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] who inherits the [[One Ring]] from his cousin [[Bilbo Baggins]] and undertakes the quest to destroy it in the fires of [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]]. He is mentioned in Tolkien's posthumously published works, ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. \n\nFrodo is repeatedly wounded during the quest, and becomes increasingly burdened by the Ring as it nears Mordor. He changes, too, growing in understanding and compassion, and avoiding violence.\n\nFrodo's name comes from the [[Old English]] name ''[[Froda|Fr\u00f3da]]'', meaning \"wise by experience\". Commentators have written that he combines courage, selflessness, and fidelity, and that as a good character, he seems unexciting but grows through his quest, an unheroic person who reaches heroic stature.\n\n==Internal history==\n\n===Background===\n\nIn ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the protagonist [[Bilbo Baggins]] is taken by the Wizard Gandalf and a party of [[Dwarves (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] from his safe home, [[Bag End]], in [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] across the [[Misty Mountains]] and the dark forest of [[Mirkwood]] to recapture the Dwarves' ancient home and treasure under the Lonely Mountain. The treasure is guarded by a [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragon]], [[Smaug]]. Through many adventures, Smaug is killed and Bilbo returns home with a substantial portion of the treasure. He lives the life of a rich eccentric for many years.\n\nFrodo is introduced in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as Bilbo's relative and adoptive heir. The chapter \"A Long-expected Party\" relates that Frodo's parents Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck had been killed in a boating accident when Frodo was 12; Frodo spent the next nine years living with his maternal family, the Brandybucks in Brandy Hall. At the age of 21 he was adopted by his cousin,{{efn|Although Frodo referred to Bilbo as his \"uncle\", they were in fact first ''and'' second cousins, once removed either way (his paternal great-great-uncle's son's son and his maternal great-aunt's son).}} Bilbo, who brought him to live at Bag End. He and Bilbo shared the same birthday, the 22nd of 'September'.

It relates the unnamed speaker's journey to a mysterious land across the sea, where he tries but fails to make contact with the people who dwell there. He descends into despair and near-madness, eventually returning to his own country, to find himself utterly alienated from those he once knew.<ref name=\"Flieger2001\">{{cite book |last=Flieger |first=Verlyn |title=A Question of Time: J.R.R.

In drafts of the final chapters, published as ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'', Gandalf names Frodo ''Bronwe athan Harthad'' (\"Endurance Beyond Hope\"), after the destruction of the Ring. Tolkien states that Frodo's name in [[Westron]] was ''Maura Labingi''.<ref group=T>Tolkien, Christopher. ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', Volume XII, ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', \"The Appendix on Languages\", pp. 48, 50.</ref> In ''[[The Return of the King]]'' he is also called ''Daur'', Sindarin for \"noble\".<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'' by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]</ref>\n\n==Interpretations== \n\nFrodo is the only prominent hobbit whose name is not explained in Tolkien's Appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings''. In a letter Tolkien states that it is the [[Old English]] name ''[[Froda|Fr\u00f3da]]'', connected to ''[[Germanic name#Frod|fr\u00f3d]]'', \"wise by experience\".<ref group=T>''[[Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', #168</ref> The Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] suggests that the choice of name is significant: not, in Tolkien's phrase, one of the many \"names that had no meaning at all in [the hobbits'] daily language\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}} Instead, he notes, the [[Old Norse]] name ''[[Fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]'' is mentioned in ''[[Beowulf]]'' as the minor character ''Fr\u00f3da''. ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i'' was, he writes, said by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] and [[Snorri Sturluson]] to be a peaceful ruler at the time of Christ, his time being named the ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0a-fri\u00f0'', the peace of ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i''. This was created by his magic mill, worked by two female giants, that could churn out peace and gold. He makes the giants work all day long at this task, until they rebel and grind out an army instead, which kills him and takes over, making the giants grind salt until the sea is full of it. The name ''Fr\u00f3\u00f0i'' is forgotten. Clearly, Shippey observes, evil is impossible to cure; and Frodo too is a \"peacemaker, indeed in the end a [[pacifist]]\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}} And, he writes, as Frodo gains experience through the quest, he also gains wisdom, matching the meaning of his name.{{sfn|Shippey|2005|pp=231-237}}\n\nMichael Stanton, writing in the ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'', describes Frodo's character as combining \"courage, selflessness, and fidelity\",{{sfn|Stanton|2013|pp=223\u2013225}} attributes that make Frodo ideal as a Ring-bearer. He lacks Sam's simple sturdiness, Merry and Pippin's clowning, and the [[psychopathology]] of Gollum, writes Stanton, bearing out the saying that good is less exciting than evil; but Frodo grows through his quest, becoming \"ennobled\" by it, to the extent that returning to the Shire feels in Frodo's words \"like falling asleep again\".{{sfn|Stanton|2013|pp=223\u2013225}}\n\nThe Tolkien scholar [[Jane Chance]] quotes [[Randel Helms]]'s view that in both ''The Hobbit'' and ''Lord of the Rings'', \"a most unheroic hobbit achieves heroic stature\" in a quest romance.{{sfn|Nitzsche|1980|pp=97-98}}{{sfn|Helms|1974|p=21}} Chance writes that Frodo grows from seeing the threat as external, such as from the Black Riders, to internal, whether within the Fellowship, as shown by Boromir's attempt on the Ring, or within himself, as he struggles against the controlling power of the Ring.{{sfn|Nitzsche|1980|p=99}}\n\nThe Tolkien critic [[Paul H. Kocher]] discusses the role of [[Divine providence|providence]], in the form of the intentions of the angel-like [[Valar]] or of the creator [[Eru Il\u00favatar]], in Bilbo's finding of the Ring and Frodo's bearing of it; as Gandalf says, Frodo was \"meant\" to have it, though it remains his choice to co-operate with this purpose.{{sfn|Kocher|1974|p=37}}\n\n==Adaptations==\n\nFrodo appears in adaptations of ''The Lord of the Rings'' for radio, cinema, and stage.

In 1957 he moved with his father to the United Kingdom and since then he has lived in several countries for more than 34 years. He returned to [[Cyprus]] in 1991 as part of the founding faculty of the [[University of Cyprus]] where he holds the position of Professor of English and Comparative Literature.<ref>http://www.hum.ucy.ac.cy/ENG/people/stephanides.htm</ref>  Stephanides\u2019 dominant and literary language is English, and he is also fluent in Greek, Spanish and Portuguese. His early migration from [[Cyprus]] to the United Kingdom and subsequent work and travel in many countries has been influential in shaping the transcultural character of his work. As a young lecturer at the university of [[Guyana]], he became deeply interested in [[Caribbean]] literary and cultural expression and his anthropological work with the descendant of Indian indentured labourers in Guyanese villages and sugar plantations marked the beginning of a lifelong interest in Indian culture and the Indian diaspora, his creative and academic writing span issues of cross-culturality, dislocation and [[Human migration|migration]].  ''Hail Mother Kali'' deals with issues of a broken postcolonial society of racially mixed Indian and African descendants in Guyana.\n\n== Early life ==\nStephanides was born in [[Trikomo, Cyprus|Trikomo]] a village located in the North-east part of [[Cyprus]]. When he was eight years old, his father took him from Cyprus to the United Kingdom.  Following his parents separation when he was still an infant, he lived with his grandparent in the village. His work documents warm memories of village life of that time that period, which was also marked by the emergence of the [[EOKA]] organization and the struggle against [[British Empire|British]] Colonial Rule. His father settled in Bristol but Stephanides was left in [[Manchester]] for two years with his uncle's family. He subsequently went to school in [[Bristol]]. In his teenage years he developed a love for literature, writing poetry, and learning foreign languages when he was at school and was encouraged by his teachers to pursue literary studies at University. Stephanides graduated from [[Cardiff University]], Wales, in 1973, and obtained a PhD from the same University in 1981.\n\n== Life and work ==\n\nHe left the United Kingdom in 1976 and lived and travelled in Greece, Spain, and Portugal for two years before receiving an appointment with the University of Guyana in 1978 where he stayed for six years. As a result, he became immersed in Caribbean and [[Brazilian culture]]. He moved to Washington DC in the mid-80s where he worked as a professional translator and conference interpreter, researcher and writer. In 1985 he was awarded a grant by the [[American Translators Association]] to translate a book on [[British Guyana]] written in Portuguese in the 19th century by a Portuguese writer. In 1988 he made a documentary film on Kali worship in Guyana called ''Hail Mother Kali'' that was short-listed for an award for excellence by the Society of Anthro-Journalism. In 1989 he was awarded the poetry award of the Society for Humanistic Anthropology of the American Anthropological Association (AAA)<ref>http://www.aaanet.org/sections/sha/sha-prize-winners/</ref> for poetry  written during field work in Guyana. In 1991 he returned to Cyprus accompanied by his US-born wife and daughter.<ref>http://www.aaanet.org/sections/sha/sha-prize-winners/</ref> Stephanides cites a variety of authors from differing cultural and social backgrounds as influences in his work. He cites Derek Walcott as an influence in the English language, drawing inspiration from him through the way he brings together the Creole idiom into with the classical. He also cites [[Constantine P. Cavafy]] as a favourite. He was a friend of the Greek-Cypriot writer Niki Marangou, translating her poetry into English and maintaining a close literary relationship with her until her death.\n\n== Contribution to Cypriot literature==\n\nStephanides serves as an advisory editor for the publication of Cadences, a journal of literature and the arts in Cyprus which\nis published by [[European University Cyprus]]. He has served twice as a judge for the [[Commonwealth Writers Prize]] in 2000 and 2010. He was made Fellow of the English Association and Cavaliere of the [[Republic of Italy]] for promoting the [[Italian culture]] in Cyprus. In his recent documentary entitled ''No Man's Land'' he managed to unite poets from different cultural and linguistic background bringing together speakers of minority languages, such as [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and Portuguese. In 2009, he edited a special issue on Cypriot writing for ''91st Meridian'', an online publication by the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://iwp.uiowa.edu/91st/vol6-num3/excerpta-cypriana-introduction|title=Excerpta Cypriana: Introduction {{!}} The International Writing Program|website=iwp.uiowa.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref> where he also attended the 2016 Fall Residency.

This unit has since been withdrawn and scrapped.]]\n\nThe [[British Rail]] '''Class 421''' (or [[British Rail unit designations|4Cig]]) [[electrical multiple unit]]s were built at BR's [[Holgate Road carriage works]] between 1964 and 1972. Units were built in two batches, and were initially introduced on services on the [[Brighton Main Line]]. Later units were introduced on services to [[Portsmouth]]. These units replaced older [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]]-designed units, such as the [[British Rail Class 403|5Bel]] \"Brighton Belle\" units, and [[British Rail Class 404|4Cor]] units. Towards the end of their life, with the increasing use of newer trains which were equipped with sliding or [[plug door]]s, these trains were known commonly as \"[[slam-door trains]]\". The fleet's lifespan was 46 years.\n\n==Standard units==\nThe standard units contained only passenger accommodation, and formed the bulk of the fleet. They were unusual in that all four [[traction motor]]s were mounted on one non-driving motor coach. Units consisted of two driving trailers, sandwiching the non-driving motor coach and an intermediate trailer.\n\nUnits were built in two batches. 'Phase 1' units were built from 1963 to 1966 for the [[Brighton]] Line, and were numbered 7301-7336. These were followed in 1970-72 by the 'Phase 2' units, built primarily for the [[Portsmouth]] line, numbered 7337-7438.\n\n==4Big units==\nThe [[British Rail unit designations|4Big]] units were similar to the standard units, but contained a buffet car in place of the intermediate trailer.\n\nThese units were also built in two batches. 'Phase 1' units were built in 1965/66, and were numbered 7031-48. 'Phase 2' units were built in 1970, and were numbered 7049-7058.\n\nThe 4Big fleet were initially classified as '''Class 420''' by British Rail under the new computer numbering system introduced in 1968, and then '''Class 422'''.\n\n==Vehicle numbering==\nThe numbering of individual vehicles and details of when units were built are shown in the table below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Phase\n!Type\n!Unit nos.\n!Years built\n!DTCsoL\n!MBSO\n!TSO (*TRSB)\n!DTCsoL\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Phase 1\n|4Cig\n|7301\u20137336\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1964\u201365\n|76076\u201376111\n|62017\u201362052\n|70695\u201370730\n|76022\u201376057\n|-\n|4Big\n|7031\u20137048\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1964\u201365\n|76112\u201376129\n|62053\u201362070\n|69301\u201369318*\n|76058\u201376075\n|-\n|rowspan=4|Phase 2\n|rowspan=3|4Cig\n|7337-7366\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1970\n|76581\u201376610\n|62287\u201362316\n|70967\u201370996\n|76611\u201376640\n|-\n|7367\u20137437\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1970\u201372\n|76717\u201376787\n|62355\u201362425\n|71035\u201371105\n|76788\u201376858\n|-\n|7438\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1972\n|76859\n|62430\n|71106\n|76860\n|-\n|4Big\n|7049-7058\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1970\n|76561\u201376570\n|62277\u201362286\n|69330\u201369339*\n|76571\u201376580\n|}\n[[File:1908 at London Victoria.JPG|thumb|right|Class 421/6 no. 1908 at [[London Victoria railway station|London Victoria]] on 15 August 2004.

It was withdrawn in October 2004 and has since been scrapped.]]\n\n==Refurbishment==\nUnits were facelifted between 1986 and 1993.\n\n===8Mig units===\nIn 1983, two temporary [[British Rail unit designations|8Mig]] units, given the TOPS classification Class 482 and numbered 2601\u20132602,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-centre.com/uploads/7/2/2/3/7223531/all_time_emu_classes.pdf |title=The All Time Guide to EMU Classifications |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Railway Centre |publisher= |access-date=15 January 2019 |quote=}}</ref> were formed while the 4Big fleet underwent asbestos removal. They were used on the Portsmouth Direct line. Therefore, four standard 'Phase 2' 4Cig units, numbers 7401\u20137404, were reformed with a conventional locomotive-hauled miniature buffet carriage (RMB). Each 8Mig unit was formed by marshalling the RMB coach in between two units, one of which was reduced to three carriages, with the removal of the intermediate trailer (TSO). Thus in effect each 8Mig unit was effectively formed of 4Cig + RMB + 3Cig. The formations of the units are listed below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!rowspan=2|8Mig unit No.\n!colspan=5|4Cig unit\n!rowspan=2|RMB coach\n!colspan=4|3Cig unit\n|-\n!Unit no.\n!DTCsoL\n!MBSO\n!TSO\n!DTCsoL\n!Unit no.\n!DTCsoL\n!MBSO\n!DTCsoL\n|-\n| '''2601'''\n| '''7401'''\n| 76751\n| 62389\n| 71069\n| 76822\n| 1872\n| '''7402'''\n| 76752\n| 62390\n| 76823\n|-\n| '''2602'''\n| '''7403'''\n| 76753\n| 62391\n| 71071\n| 76804\n| 1873\n| '''7404'''\n| 76754\n| 62392\n| 76825\n|-\n|}\n\nThese units were only used during the summer of 1983, after which enough asbestos-free 4Big units were available. The two 8Mig units were disbanded and the four 4Cig unit reformed. The 4Cig units have since been renumbered several times, as shown below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!colspan=2|Unrefurbished\n!colspan=3|Facelifted\n|-\n!74xx series\n!12xx series\n!18xx series\n!8Dig unit\n!18xx series\n|-\n| 7401\n| 1201\n| 1868\n| -\n| -\n|-\n| 7402\n| 1202\n| 1860\n| -\n| -\n|-\n| 7403\n| 1203\n| 1869\n| -\n| -\n|-\n| 7404\n| 1204\n| 1875\n| 2001\n| 1802\n|-\n|}\n\n===8Dig units===\nIn 1992 four [[British Rail unit designations|8Dig]] units, numbered 2001-2004, were formed by semi-permanently coupling a 4Cig and a 4Big unit. The units were dedicated to [[London Waterloo railway station|London Victoria]] to [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]] express services, which were operated as the '''Capital\u2013Coast Express'''.\n\nThe 8Dig units were formed from four 'Phase 2' 4Big units plus two 'Phase 1' and two 'Phase 2' 4Cig units. The 'Phase 1' units, numbers 1901/02 (recently renumbered from 1715/16), were fitted with Mk.6 motor bogies. One of the 'Phase 2' 4Cig units, no. 1875 (ex. 7404), had previously been part of 8Mig unit 2602.

The various 4Cig and 4Big units were reformed and gained their original numbers, except unit 1875, which was renumbered to 1802.\n\n[[File:1879 at London Charing Cross.jpg|thumb|right|Class 421/4, no. 1879, at [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]] on 18 March 2003, with a service to [[Hastings]].

This unit has since been withdrawn from traffic and scrapped.]]\n\n==Final years of operation==\n\nTwo units had remained in service until 22 May 2010, 3Cig units nos. 1497 and 1498, which were used on the [[Lymington Branch Line]]. These two units were withdrawn from service on 22 May 2010 and replaced by [[British Rail Class 158|Class 158]] [[Diesel Multiple Unit]]s.  1497 is now preserved at The Mid Norfolk Railway and 1498 is now preserved on the [[Epping Ongar Railway]].<ref name=HR134>{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Robin  |year=2010 |title=End of line for Lymington slam-door stock |journal=Heritage Railway |volume= |issue= '''134''' (18 February - 17 March 2010) |page=61 |url= |doi= }}</ref> The latter has had an extra carriage added to restore its original 4Cig formation.\n\n==Privatisation to withdrawal==\n\nAfter rail privatisation in the mid-1990s the different divisions of British Rail were divided up into different franchises. The three former SR division \u2013 South-Eastern, South Central and South-Western \u2013 all operated 4Cig units, and are dealt with separately here.\n\n===South Eastern Trains===\n'''[[South Eastern Trains]]''' (SET) operated a small fleet of three 'Phase 1' and 22 'Phase 2' 4Cig units. The franchise was originally operated by [[Connex South Eastern]].\n\nAll but one of the 'Phase 2' units continued to carry the obsolete [[Network SouthEast]] livery. One unit, no. 1870, was repainted into Connex South Eastern yellow and white. The three 'Phase 1' units were painted in white undercoat livery, since their use was originally only supposed to be short-term. However, despite this, the units remained in traffic for seven more years, from 1997 to 2004. They were popularly known as \"Ghosts\" by rail enthusiasts.\n\nFrom 2003 units started to be withdrawn, having been replaced by the second batch of the new [[British Rail Class 375|\"Electrostar\" units]]. The three 'Phase 1' units had gone by mid-2004. The final unit, no. 1843, lingered on for several months longer than its classmates, eventually being withdrawn in mid-November 2004. All the SET units have been scrapped.\n\n===South Central / Southern===\nThe South Central Division inherited the largest fleet of 4Cig units. Originally this included all remaining 'Phase 1' units (though some were later transferred to [[South Eastern Trains]]), 35 'Phase 2' units, and the four 8Dig units. The remaining few 4Big units were also used on the former Central Division.\n\nThe South Central franchise was initially won by [[Connex South Central]], which applied its yellow and white livery to most stock. In 2000 it lost the franchise to the [[Go-Ahead Group]], which operated the franchise as '''[[Southern (train operating company)|South Central]]'''. In 2004 this was changed to '''Southern'''. Four 'Phase 1' units (nos. 1735/38/40, 1908) and eight 'Phase 2' units (nos. 1854/56-62) received Southern's new green livery.\n\nIn 1997 the remaining 4Big units were withdrawn. Eight were transferred to [[South West Trains]]. The remaining eleven unit were heavily rebuilt at [[Eastleigh railway works|Eastleigh]] Works, with compartments removed and opened out, and the buffet carriages withdrawn. The modified units were reclassified as '''Class 421/7''' and renumbered into the 1401\u20131411 range. The units were also known as [[British Rail unit designations|3Cop]] units, which denoted their intended use, i.e. dedicated to [[East Coastway Line|East Coastway]] and [[West Coastway Line|West Coastway]] services out of [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]]. Two units received names \u2013 a rarity for slam-door EMU stock.\n*1408 - [[Littlehampton|Littlehampton Progress 2000]]\n*1409 - Operation Perseus\nIn 2004 some units were augmented to four carriages with the addition of a 'Phase 1' intermediate trailer, and thus became 4Cop units.\n\nFrom 2003 Southern started to replace its slam-door fleet with new [[British Rail Class 377|Class 377]] [[British Rail brand names|Electrostar]] units. In general the 'Phase 1' units were withdrawn first due to their age, but as deliveries of the Electrostars increased some 'Phase 2' units were also taken out of service. By late 2004 only a handful of 'Phase 1' units and 4Cops remained in service. The final 'Phase 1' units in traffic were nos. 1704/08/11/12/14/17/43 and 1901, with the final unit, no. 1704, being withdrawn in February 2005. The final 4Cop units, nos. 1404/10/11, were withdrawn in March 2005.\n\nThe 'Phase 2' units lasted longer and two, nos. 1805 and 1866, were retained beyond August 2005, when slam-door trains lost all diagrammed work. They lasted until 19 November 2005, when they worked a farewell railtour, following which they were withdrawn.\n\n[[File:1396 at Clapham Junction.jpg|thumb|right|Class 421/8, no. 1396, at [[Clapham Junction railway station|Clapham Junction]] on 19 July 2003. This unit is one of eight \"Greyhound\" units converted from redundant 4Big units for use by [[South West Trains]]. The buffet coach was replaced with a spare [[British Rail Class 411|4Cep]] trailer vehicle, which is identifiable by its different windows as the second vehicle in the unit.]]\n\n===South West Trains===\n[[File:Guildford Station - geograph.org.uk - 571204.jpg|thumb|4Cig in 1980 in [[Guildford railway station (Surrey)|Guildford]].]]\n'''[[South West Trains]]''' inherited a small fleet of twelve 'Phase 2' 4Cig units, and the larger fleet of 22 \"Greyhound\" units which had been modified to cut several minutes from journey times on the Portsmouth Direct line with its 1 in 80 gradients by adding a second stage of field weakening to improve performance at higher speeds (17% at 54&nbsp;mph, 30% at 90&nbsp;mph).\n\nIn 1997 the fleet was augmented with the addition of eight 4Big units from [[Connex South Central]]. These operated with the counter in the buffet carriages locked out of use. By 1999 these units had been stored, but then eight additional \"Greyhound\" units were converted from the redundant 4Bigs. The units were reclassified as '''Class 421/8''', and renumbered in the range 1392\u20131399. The modifications included the removal of the buffet carriages, which were replaced by spare intermediate trailers from mechanically similar [[British Rail Class 411|4Cep]] units. Most of these trailers came from 4Cep units to make 3Cep units, but a few came from withdrawn units. These trailers were immediately recognisable since although they had the same body profile as the rest of the unit the windows were different and they had InterCity70 seating. The buffet carriages were withdrawn, although many were saved for preservation.\n\n[[File:Brockenhurst Lymington Flyer Farewell 1497.jpg|thumb|The last day of operation on the Lymington Branch Line]]\nIn December 2004 unit no. 1394 was reduced to a three-car unit with the removal of its Cep trailer. It was reclassified as '''Class 421/7''', renumbered 1499, and dedicated to the [[Lymington Branch Line]] service, where it replaced the previous incumbent unit, no. [[British Rail Class 411#South West Trains|1198]].\n\nWithdrawals of units started in mid-2004, when many new [[British Rail Class 444|Class 444]] and [[British Rail Class 450|Class 450]] \"[[Siemens Desiro|Desiro]]\" units became available for service. By the end of 2004 just a handful of units remained in traffic. The final few units were withdrawn in May 2005, with the last in traffic being 1304/09/12/16, 1392/95/96/97/98, 1499 and 1881/90. The final slam-door service ran on 26 May from [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]] to [[Bournemouth railway station|Bournemouth]] using units 1396, 1398 and [[British Rail Class 423|4Vep]] 3536. Following withdrawal two units, nos. 1304 and 1881, were transferred to \"warm storage\" for use by [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]] if required. Most of the other units were sent for scrap, with the exception of nos. 1392 and 1499.\n\nServices on the [[Lymington Branch Line]] were operated as a \"heritage\" operation using one of two refurbished 3Cig units, nos. 1497 and 1498. The two units were launched into service on 12 May 2005 having been repainted into heritage liveries, 1497 in blue and grey and 1498 in the green that the units carried when built. However, in May 2010, the new timetable changes saw the units replaced for more modern stock to save maintenance on a non-standard fleet of two units. As stated in the relevant timetable, \"The slam door trains will be remembered with affection as they pass into history.\" The change took place on 22 May 2010 and the units have been replaced by a [[British Rail Class 158|Class 158]] on weekdays and a [[British Rail Class 450|Class 450]] Desiro at weekends. The class 421s have both been preserved due to historic significance.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n*In summer 1974 (date unknown) unit 7346 ran away at Wimbledon Park and hit a flyover causing extensive damage to the cab of vehicle 76620.\n[[File:4CIG_unit_Britsh_Railwys_Sthn_Region_76620_1974.jpg|thumb|right|Phase 2 4CIG 7346 after wunning away at Wimbledon in 1974]]\n*6 November 1985, unit 7390 collided with [[4VEP]] unit 7724 at Copyhold Junction, near {{rws|Haywards Heath}}, [[West Sussex]] due to poor rail conditions and a loss of braking.

This is one of 22 \"Greyhound\" units that were operated by [[South West Trains]]. This unit has since been withdrawn and scrapped.]]\n\nThe [[British Rail]] '''Class 421''' (or [[British Rail unit designations|4Cig]]) [[electrical multiple unit]]s were built at BR's [[Holgate Road carriage works]] between 1964 and 1972. Units were built in two batches, and were initially introduced on services on the [[Brighton Main Line]]. Later units were introduced on services to [[Portsmouth]]. These units replaced older [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]]-designed units, such as the [[British Rail Class 403|5Bel]] \"Brighton Belle\" units, and [[British Rail Class 404|4Cor]] units. Towards the end of their life, with the increasing use of newer trains which were equipped with sliding or [[plug door]]s, these trains were known commonly as \"[[slam-door trains]]\". The fleet's lifespan was 46 years.\n\n==Standard units==\nThe standard units contained only passenger accommodation, and formed the bulk of the fleet. They were unusual in that all four [[traction motor]]s were mounted on one non-driving motor coach. Units consisted of two driving trailers, sandwiching the non-driving motor coach and an intermediate trailer.\n\nUnits were built in two batches. 'Phase 1' units were built from 1963 to 1966 for the [[Brighton]] Line, and were numbered 7301-7336. These were followed in 1970-72 by the 'Phase 2' units, built primarily for the [[Portsmouth]] line, numbered 7337-7438.\n\n==4Big units==\nThe [[British Rail unit designations|4Big]] units were similar to the standard units, but contained a buffet car in place of the intermediate trailer.\n\nThese units were also built in two batches. 'Phase 1' units were built in 1965/66, and were numbered 7031-48. 'Phase 2' units were built in 1970, and were numbered 7049-7058.\n\nThe 4Big fleet were initially classified as '''Class 420''' by British Rail under the new computer numbering system introduced in 1968, and then '''Class 422'''.\n\n==Vehicle numbering==\nThe numbering of individual vehicles and details of when units were built are shown in the table below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Phase\n!Type\n!Unit nos.\n!Years built\n!DTCsoL\n!MBSO\n!TSO (*TRSB)\n!DTCsoL\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Phase 1\n|4Cig\n|7301\u20137336\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1964\u201365\n|76076\u201376111\n|62017\u201362052\n|70695\u201370730\n|76022\u201376057\n|-\n|4Big\n|7031\u20137048\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1964\u201365\n|76112\u201376129\n|62053\u201362070\n|69301\u201369318*\n|76058\u201376075\n|-\n|rowspan=4|Phase 2\n|rowspan=3|4Cig\n|7337-7366\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1970\n|76581\u201376610\n|62287\u201362316\n|70967\u201370996\n|76611\u201376640\n|-\n|7367\u20137437\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1970\u201372\n|76717\u201376787\n|62355\u201362425\n|71035\u201371105\n|76788\u201376858\n|-\n|7438\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1972\n|76859\n|62430\n|71106\n|76860\n|-\n|4Big\n|7049-7058\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1970\n|76561\u201376570\n|62277\u201362286\n|69330\u201369339*\n|76571\u201376580\n|}\n[[File:1908 at London Victoria.JPG|thumb|right|Class 421/6 no. 1908 at [[London Victoria railway station|London Victoria]] on 15 August 2004.

It was also one of only four 'Phase 1' units to be repainted in [[Southern (train operating company)|South Central]] livery. It was withdrawn in October 2004 and has since been scrapped.]]\n\n==Refurbishment==\nUnits were facelifted between 1986 and 1993.\n\n===8Mig units===\nIn 1983, two temporary [[British Rail unit designations|8Mig]] units, given the TOPS classification Class 482 and numbered 2601\u20132602,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-centre.com/uploads/7/2/2/3/7223531/all_time_emu_classes.pdf |title=The All Time Guide to EMU Classifications |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Railway Centre |publisher= |access-date=15 January 2019 |quote=}}</ref> were formed while the 4Big fleet underwent asbestos removal. They were used on the Portsmouth Direct line. Therefore, four standard 'Phase 2' 4Cig units, numbers 7401\u20137404, were reformed with a conventional locomotive-hauled miniature buffet carriage (RMB). Each 8Mig unit was formed by marshalling the RMB coach in between two units, one of which was reduced to three carriages, with the removal of the intermediate trailer (TSO). Thus in effect each 8Mig unit was effectively formed of 4Cig + RMB + 3Cig. The formations of the units are listed below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!rowspan=2|8Mig unit No.\n!colspan=5|4Cig unit\n!rowspan=2|RMB coach\n!colspan=4|3Cig unit\n|-\n!Unit no.\n!DTCsoL\n!MBSO\n!TSO\n!DTCsoL\n!Unit no.\n!DTCsoL\n!MBSO\n!DTCsoL\n|-\n| '''2601'''\n| '''7401'''\n| 76751\n| 62389\n| 71069\n| 76822\n| 1872\n| '''7402'''\n| 76752\n| 62390\n| 76823\n|-\n| '''2602'''\n| '''7403'''\n| 76753\n| 62391\n| 71071\n| 76804\n| 1873\n| '''7404'''\n| 76754\n| 62392\n| 76825\n|-\n|}\n\nThese units were only used during the summer of 1983, after which enough asbestos-free 4Big units were available. The two 8Mig units were disbanded and the four 4Cig unit reformed. The 4Cig units have since been renumbered several times, as shown below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!colspan=2|Unrefurbished\n!colspan=3|Facelifted\n|-\n!74xx series\n!12xx series\n!18xx series\n!8Dig unit\n!18xx series\n|-\n| 7401\n| 1201\n| 1868\n| -\n| -\n|-\n| 7402\n| 1202\n| 1860\n| -\n| -\n|-\n| 7403\n| 1203\n| 1869\n| -\n| -\n|-\n| 7404\n| 1204\n| 1875\n| 2001\n| 1802\n|-\n|}\n\n===8Dig units===\nIn 1992 four [[British Rail unit designations|8Dig]] units, numbered 2001-2004, were formed by semi-permanently coupling a 4Cig and a 4Big unit. The units were dedicated to [[London Waterloo railway station|London Victoria]] to [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]] express services, which were operated as the '''Capital\u2013Coast Express'''.\n\nThe 8Dig units were formed from four 'Phase 2' 4Big units plus two 'Phase 1' and two 'Phase 2' 4Cig units. The 'Phase 1' units, numbers 1901/02 (recently renumbered from 1715/16), were fitted with Mk.6 motor bogies. One of the 'Phase 2' 4Cig units, no. 1875 (ex. 7404), had previously been part of 8Mig unit 2602.

The various 4Cig and 4Big units were reformed and gained their original numbers, except unit 1875, which was renumbered to 1802.\n\n[[File:1879 at London Charing Cross.jpg|thumb|right|Class 421/4, no. 1879, at [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]] on 18 March 2003, with a service to [[Hastings]].

This unit has since been withdrawn from traffic and scrapped.]]\n\n==Final years of operation==\n\nTwo units had remained in service until 22 May 2010, 3Cig units nos. 1497 and 1498, which were used on the [[Lymington Branch Line]]. These two units were withdrawn from service on 22 May 2010 and replaced by [[British Rail Class 158|Class 158]] [[Diesel Multiple Unit]]s.  1497 is now preserved at The Mid Norfolk Railway and 1498 is now preserved on the [[Epping Ongar Railway]].<ref name=HR134>{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Robin  |year=2010 |title=End of line for Lymington slam-door stock |journal=Heritage Railway |volume= |issue= '''134''' (18 February - 17 March 2010) |page=61 |url= |doi= }}</ref> The latter has had an extra carriage added to restore its original 4Cig formation.\n\n==Privatisation to withdrawal==\n\nAfter rail privatisation in the mid-1990s the different divisions of British Rail were divided up into different franchises. The three former SR division \u2013 South-Eastern, South Central and South-Western \u2013 all operated 4Cig units, and are dealt with separately here.\n\n===South Eastern Trains===\n'''[[South Eastern Trains]]''' (SET) operated a small fleet of three 'Phase 1' and 22 'Phase 2' 4Cig units. The franchise was originally operated by [[Connex South Eastern]].\n\nAll but one of the 'Phase 2' units continued to carry the obsolete [[Network SouthEast]] livery. One unit, no. 1870, was repainted into Connex South Eastern yellow and white. The three 'Phase 1' units were painted in white undercoat livery, since their use was originally only supposed to be short-term. However, despite this, the units remained in traffic for seven more years, from 1997 to 2004. They were popularly known as \"Ghosts\" by rail enthusiasts.\n\nFrom 2003 units started to be withdrawn, having been replaced by the second batch of the new [[British Rail Class 375|\"Electrostar\" units]]. The three 'Phase 1' units had gone by mid-2004. The final unit, no. 1843, lingered on for several months longer than its classmates, eventually being withdrawn in mid-November 2004. All the SET units have been scrapped.\n\n===South Central / Southern===\nThe South Central Division inherited the largest fleet of 4Cig units. Originally this included all remaining 'Phase 1' units (though some were later transferred to [[South Eastern Trains]]), 35 'Phase 2' units, and the four 8Dig units. The remaining few 4Big units were also used on the former Central Division.\n\nThe South Central franchise was initially won by [[Connex South Central]], which applied its yellow and white livery to most stock. In 2000 it lost the franchise to the [[Go-Ahead Group]], which operated the franchise as '''[[Southern (train operating company)|South Central]]'''. In 2004 this was changed to '''Southern'''. Four 'Phase 1' units (nos. 1735/38/40, 1908) and eight 'Phase 2' units (nos. 1854/56-62) received Southern's new green livery.\n\nIn 1997 the remaining 4Big units were withdrawn. Eight were transferred to [[South West Trains]]. The remaining eleven unit were heavily rebuilt at [[Eastleigh railway works|Eastleigh]] Works, with compartments removed and opened out, and the buffet carriages withdrawn. The modified units were reclassified as '''Class 421/7''' and renumbered into the 1401\u20131411 range. The units were also known as [[British Rail unit designations|3Cop]] units, which denoted their intended use, i.e. dedicated to [[East Coastway Line|East Coastway]] and [[West Coastway Line|West Coastway]] services out of [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]]. Two units received names \u2013 a rarity for slam-door EMU stock.\n*1408 - [[Littlehampton|Littlehampton Progress 2000]]\n*1409 - Operation Perseus\nIn 2004 some units were augmented to four carriages with the addition of a 'Phase 1' intermediate trailer, and thus became 4Cop units.\n\nFrom 2003 Southern started to replace its slam-door fleet with new [[British Rail Class 377|Class 377]] [[British Rail brand names|Electrostar]] units. In general the 'Phase 1' units were withdrawn first due to their age, but as deliveries of the Electrostars increased some 'Phase 2' units were also taken out of service. By late 2004 only a handful of 'Phase 1' units and 4Cops remained in service. The final 'Phase 1' units in traffic were nos. 1704/08/11/12/14/17/43 and 1901, with the final unit, no. 1704, being withdrawn in February 2005. The final 4Cop units, nos. 1404/10/11, were withdrawn in March 2005.\n\nThe 'Phase 2' units lasted longer and two, nos. 1805 and 1866, were retained beyond August 2005, when slam-door trains lost all diagrammed work. They lasted until 19 November 2005, when they worked a farewell railtour, following which they were withdrawn.\n\n[[File:1396 at Clapham Junction.jpg|thumb|right|Class 421/8, no. 1396, at [[Clapham Junction railway station|Clapham Junction]] on 19 July 2003. This unit is one of eight \"Greyhound\" units converted from redundant 4Big units for use by [[South West Trains]]. The buffet coach was replaced with a spare [[British Rail Class 411|4Cep]] trailer vehicle, which is identifiable by its different windows as the second vehicle in the unit.]]\n\n===South West Trains===\n[[File:Guildford Station - geograph.org.uk - 571204.jpg|thumb|4Cig in 1980 in [[Guildford railway station (Surrey)|Guildford]].]]\n'''[[South West Trains]]''' inherited a small fleet of twelve 'Phase 2' 4Cig units, and the larger fleet of 22 \"Greyhound\" units which had been modified to cut several minutes from journey times on the Portsmouth Direct line with its 1 in 80 gradients by adding a second stage of field weakening to improve performance at higher speeds (17% at 54&nbsp;mph, 30% at 90&nbsp;mph).\n\nIn 1997 the fleet was augmented with the addition of eight 4Big units from [[Connex South Central]]. These operated with the counter in the buffet carriages locked out of use. By 1999 these units had been stored, but then eight additional \"Greyhound\" units were converted from the redundant 4Bigs. The units were reclassified as '''Class 421/8''', and renumbered in the range 1392\u20131399. The modifications included the removal of the buffet carriages, which were replaced by spare intermediate trailers from mechanically similar [[British Rail Class 411|4Cep]] units. Most of these trailers came from 4Cep units to make 3Cep units, but a few came from withdrawn units. These trailers were immediately recognisable since although they had the same body profile as the rest of the unit the windows were different and they had InterCity70 seating. The buffet carriages were withdrawn, although many were saved for preservation.\n\n[[File:Brockenhurst Lymington Flyer Farewell 1497.jpg|thumb|The last day of operation on the Lymington Branch Line]]\nIn December 2004 unit no. 1394 was reduced to a three-car unit with the removal of its Cep trailer. It was reclassified as '''Class 421/7''', renumbered 1499, and dedicated to the [[Lymington Branch Line]] service, where it replaced the previous incumbent unit, no. [[British Rail Class 411#South West Trains|1198]].\n\nWithdrawals of units started in mid-2004, when many new [[British Rail Class 444|Class 444]] and [[British Rail Class 450|Class 450]] \"[[Siemens Desiro|Desiro]]\" units became available for service. By the end of 2004 just a handful of units remained in traffic. The final few units were withdrawn in May 2005, with the last in traffic being 1304/09/12/16, 1392/95/96/97/98, 1499 and 1881/90. The final slam-door service ran on 26 May from [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]] to [[Bournemouth railway station|Bournemouth]] using units 1396, 1398 and [[British Rail Class 423|4Vep]] 3536. Following withdrawal two units, nos. 1304 and 1881, were transferred to \"warm storage\" for use by [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]] if required. Most of the other units were sent for scrap, with the exception of nos. 1392 and 1499.\n\nServices on the [[Lymington Branch Line]] were operated as a \"heritage\" operation using one of two refurbished 3Cig units, nos. 1497 and 1498. The two units were launched into service on 12 May 2005 having been repainted into heritage liveries, 1497 in blue and grey and 1498 in the green that the units carried when built. However, in May 2010, the new timetable changes saw the units replaced for more modern stock to save maintenance on a non-standard fleet of two units. As stated in the relevant timetable, \"The slam door trains will be remembered with affection as they pass into history.\" The change took place on 22 May 2010 and the units have been replaced by a [[British Rail Class 158|Class 158]] on weekdays and a [[British Rail Class 450|Class 450]] Desiro at weekends. The class 421s have both been preserved due to historic significance.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n*In summer 1974 (date unknown) unit 7346 ran away at Wimbledon Park and hit a flyover causing extensive damage to the cab of vehicle 76620.\n*6 November 1985, unit 7390 collided with [[4VEP]] unit 7724 at Copyhold Junction, near {{rws|Haywards Heath}}, [[West Sussex]] due to poor rail conditions and a loss of braking.
