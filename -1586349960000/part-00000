The original idea was a \"Netflix box\" that could download movies overnight, and be ready to watch the next day. By 2005, they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service, and were ready to go public with it. But after discovering YouTube, and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead, a project that was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|title=The inside story of how Netflix transitioned to digital video after seeing the power of YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044036/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNetflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers.

But when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007, it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and TV-shows, just 1% compared to its more than 100,000 different DVD titles. Yet as the popularity kept growing, the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in June 2009. One of the key things about Netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as cinematch, which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service, by creating a switching cost, but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations. This was an attribute that not only benefited Netflix but also benefited its viewers and those studios which were minor compared to others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profkenhoma.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/netflix-managing-a-still-hot-business-as-its-time-runs-out/|title=Netflix \u2013 Managing a still-hot business as its time runs out.|date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1&nbsp;million United States streaming customers, and 29.4&nbsp;million total streaming customers.

If the film had been in theaters it would have made the equivalent of $556&nbsp;million based on a $9 ticket price. Critics cast doubt that this number of people would have watched the film given that it would have made the film more popular than the finale of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston-viewer-data?verso=true|title=A Mystery Indeed Netflix Claims New Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston Movie Drew Record Views|work=Vanity Fair|date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Netflix changed the method it used to estimate viewers for a show. Prior to this, Netflix counted a viewer towards viewership if they watched 70% of the show; with the new change, a viewer need only watch two minutes of the show to count. Netflix stated the two-minute metric indicated that the viewer chose to watch the show, and thus counted in its viewership. This also eliminated factors such as length of the work, so that both short and long works would be treated equally. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix estimated this increased viewership by 35% on average.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/6-underground-viewed-by-83-million-members-netflix-says-1271794 | title = Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Viewed by 83 Million Members, Netflix Says | first = Pamela | last = McClintock | date = January 21, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> This new metric was criticized as commentators felt two minutes was far too little of any show to engage a viewer, and instead the move by Netflix was to artificially increase viewership to put their numbers on par with television networks and movie ticket sales, such as trying to compare viewership of ''[[The Witcher (TV series)|The Witcher]]'' with that of HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/ | title = Netflix's Big Viewership Numbers Mean Very Little | first = Tyler | last = Coates | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-viewership-stats-just-got-more-meaningless-witcher-6-underground/ | title = Netflix viewership stats just got more meaningless | first= Joan | last =Solsman | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020  |work = [[CNet]] }}</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe rise of Netflix has affected the way that audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt points out that the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, so an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just continue into the next episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt/|title=What Television Will Look Like in 2025, According to Netflix|work=Wired|accessdate=July 11, 2014|date=May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706052711/http://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt|archivedate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30-minute or 60-minute time slots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform which allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a \"season\". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Netflix|url=http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|title=Netflix's Long Term View|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606120536/http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|archivedate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNetflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of ''House of Cards'': \"Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'\" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now.

According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60-percent of Americans said that they binge-watch shows, and nearly 8 out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=February 14, 2014|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302041456/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|archivedate=March 2, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area|Companies|Film}}\n* [[Hulu]]\n* [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix]]\n* [[Streaming television]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\nNetflix upgrades to HD video streaming in India for basic plans & Mobile [https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEDpIGcQGXD7-o6I7UMAqxSQqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowsruUCzDxgKoDMKPExQY?hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN%3Aen]\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=McDonald |first1=Kevin |last2=Smith- Rowsey |first2=Daniel |title=The Netflix Effect |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic & Professional |isbn=9781501309441 |pages=270 |edition=1st}}\n{{Refend}}\n; Videos:\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO0FlrveCts|title=Why Netflix Is Struggling In India|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=2018-12-11}}\n; blog:\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.onlytopcontent.com/top-10-best-movies-to-watch-on-netflix-india/|title=Top 10 movies to watch in india|publisher=[[onlytopcontent]]|date=2020-04-08}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website|name=Netflix}}\n*[[List of accolades received by Netflix]]\n{{Finance links\n| name = Netflix\n| symbol = NFLX\n| sec_cik = NFLX\n| yahoo = NFLX\n| google = NFLX\n}}\n{{Netflix|state=collapsed}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Netflix programming\n|titlestyle=background:#ccccff\n|list1=\n{{Netflix original current series|state=collapsed}}\n{{Netflix original continuation series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original ended series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original upcoming series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix specials|state=collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{VOD services}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Video rental shops}}\n{{CATV USA|state=collapsed}}\n{{Major Internet companies}}\n{{Film Studio}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Netflix| ]]\n[[Category:1997 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:2002 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Silicon Valley]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Santa Clara County, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Los Gatos, California]]\n[[Category:Companies in the NASDAQ-100 Index]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 1997]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Members of the Motion Picture Association of America]]\n[[Category:Online retailers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Recommender systems]]\n[[Category:TvOS software]]\n[[Category:Universal Windows Platform apps]]\n[[Category:Video rental services]]\n[[Category:Internet television streaming services]]\n[[Category:Subscription video on demand services]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 software]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the media service}}\n{{short description|Internet video streaming and DVD-by-mail service with original and licensed content}}\n{{Use American English|date=May 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Infobox dot-com company\n| name = Netflix, Inc.\n| logo = [[File:Netflix 2015 logo.svg|frameless|upright]]\n| screenshot =Netflix -

By 2005, they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service, and were ready to go public with it. But after discovering YouTube, and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead, a project that was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|title=The inside story of how Netflix transitioned to digital video after seeing the power of YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044036/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNetflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers.

But when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007, it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and TV-shows, just 1% compared to its more than 100,000 different DVD titles. Yet as the popularity kept growing, the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in June 2009. One of the key things about Netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as cinematch, which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service, by creating a switching cost, but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations. This was an attribute that not only benefited Netflix but also benefited its viewers and those studios which were minor compared to others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profkenhoma.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/netflix-managing-a-still-hot-business-as-its-time-runs-out/|title=Netflix \u2013 Managing a still-hot business as its time runs out.|date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1&nbsp;million United States streaming customers, and 29.4&nbsp;million total streaming customers.

If the film had been in theaters it would have made the equivalent of $556&nbsp;million based on a $9 ticket price. Critics cast doubt that this number of people would have watched the film given that it would have made the film more popular than the finale of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston-viewer-data?verso=true|title=A Mystery Indeed Netflix Claims New Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston Movie Drew Record Views|work=Vanity Fair|date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Netflix changed the method it used to estimate viewers for a show. Prior to this, Netflix counted a viewer towards viewership if they watched 70% of the show; with the new change, a viewer need only watch two minutes of the show to count. Netflix stated the two-minute metric indicated that the viewer chose to watch the show, and thus counted in its viewership. This also eliminated factors such as length of the work, so that both short and long works would be treated equally. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix estimated this increased viewership by 35% on average.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/6-underground-viewed-by-83-million-members-netflix-says-1271794 | title = Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Viewed by 83 Million Members, Netflix Says | first = Pamela | last = McClintock | date = January 21, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> This new metric was criticized as commentators felt two minutes was far too little of any show to engage a viewer, and instead the move by Netflix was to artificially increase viewership to put their numbers on par with television networks and movie ticket sales, such as trying to compare viewership of ''[[The Witcher (TV series)|The Witcher]]'' with that of HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/ | title = Netflix's Big Viewership Numbers Mean Very Little | first = Tyler | last = Coates | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-viewership-stats-just-got-more-meaningless-witcher-6-underground/ | title = Netflix viewership stats just got more meaningless | first= Joan | last =Solsman | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020  |work = [[CNet]] }}</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe rise of Netflix has affected the way that audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt points out that the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, so an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just continue into the next episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt/|title=What Television Will Look Like in 2025, According to Netflix|work=Wired|accessdate=July 11, 2014|date=May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706052711/http://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt|archivedate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30-minute or 60-minute time slots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform which allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a \"season\". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Netflix|url=http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|title=Netflix's Long Term View|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606120536/http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|archivedate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNetflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of ''House of Cards'': \"Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'\" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now.

As described above, \"Internet television\" is \"over-the-top technology\" (OTT). Both IPTV and OTT use the Internet protocol over a [[packet-switched network]] to transmit data, but IPTV operates in a closed system\u2014a dedicated, managed network controlled by the local cable, satellite, telephone, or fiber-optic company.<ref>{{cite web|last=Narang|first=Nitin|title= Concept Series : What is the Difference between OTT and IPTV|url=http://www.mediaentertainmentinfo.com/2013/04/2-concept-series-what-is-the-difference-between-ott-and-iptv.html/|work=Researcher on TV technology|publisher=Media Entertainment Info|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> In its simplest form, IPTV simply replaces traditional [[circuit switched]] analog or [[digital television]] channels with digital channels which happen to use packet-switched transmission. In both the old and new systems, subscribers have [[set-top box]]es or other [[customer-premises equipment]] that communicates directly over company-owned or dedicated leased lines with central-office servers. Packets never travel over the public Internet, so the television provider can guarantee enough local bandwidth for each customer's needs.\n\nThe Internet protocol is a cheap, standardized way to enable two-way communication and simultaneously provide different data (e.g., TV-show files, email, Web browsing) to different customers. This supports DVR-like features for [[time shifting]] television: for example, to catch up on a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago, or to replay the current TV show from its beginning. It also supports [[video on demand]]\u2014browsing a catalog of videos (such as movies or television shows) which might be unrelated to the company's scheduled broadcasts.\n\nIPTV has an ongoing standardization process (for example, at the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]).\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!\n!IPTV\n!Over-the-top technology\n|-\n!Content provider\n|Local telecom\n|Studio, channel, or independent service\n|-\n!Transmission network\n|Local telecom - dedicated owned or leased network\n|Public Internet + local telecom\n|-\n!Receiver\n|Local telecom provides  (set-top box)\n|Purchased by consumer (box, stick, TV, computer, or mobile)\n|-\n!Display device\n|Screen provided by consumer\n|Screen provided by consumer\n|-\n!Examples\n| [[AT&T U-verse]], [[Bell Fibe TV]], [[Verizon Fios]] (IPTV service now discontinued)\n| [[Video on demand]] services like [[fuboTV]], [[PlayStation Vue]], [[Sky Go]], [[YouTube]], [[Netflix]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[DittoTV]], [[Yupptv|YuppTV]], [[Lovefilm]], [[BBC iPlayer]], [[Hulu]], [[Sony Liv]], [[MyTV (Arabic)|myTV]], [[Now TV (UK)|Now TV]], [[Emagine International|Emagine]], [[Sling TV|SlingTV]], KlowdTV\n|}\n\n==Streaming quality==\nStreaming quality is the quality of image and audio transmission from the servers of the distributor to the user's screen. High-definition video (720p+) and later standards require higher bandwidth and faster connection speeds than previous standards, because they carry higher spatial resolution image content. In addition, transmission packet loss and latency caused by network impairments and insufficient bandwidth degrade replay quality. Decoding errors may manifest themselves with video breakup and macro blocks. The generally accepted download rate for streaming high-definition video encoded in [[H.264]] is 3500 kbit/s, whereas standard-definition television can range from 500 to 1500 kbit/s depending on the resolution on screen. In the UK, the BBC iPlayer deals with the largest amount of traffic yet it offers HD content along with SD content. As more people have gotten broadband connections which can deal with streaming HD video over the Internet, the BBC iPlayer has tried to keep up with demand and pace. However, as streaming HD video takes around 1.5 GB of data per hour of video the BBC has had to invest a lot of money collected from License Fee payers to implement this on a large scale.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/04/bbc_iplayer_goes_hd_adds_highe.html BBC iPlayer goes HD, adds higher quality streams, releases iPlayer Desktop out of Labs], BBC Internet Blog, 20/04/2009</ref>\n\nFor users who do not have the bandwidth to stream HD video or even high-SD video, which requires 1500 kbit/s, the BBC iPlayer offers lower bitrate streams which in turn lead to lower video quality. This makes use of an adaptive bitrate stream so that if the user's bandwidth suddenly drops, iPlayer will lower its streaming rate to compensate. A diagnostic tool offered on the BBC iPlayer site measures a user's streaming capabilities and bandwidth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/diagnostics |title=BBC web page which runs a diagnostic of Internet download speeds for streaming remotely |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nInternet television is common in most US households as of the mid 2010s.

These rights govern the distribution of copyrighted content and media and allow the sole distribution of that content at any one time. An example of content only being aired in certain countries is BBC iPlayer. The BBC checks a user's IP address to make sure that only users located in the UK can stream content from the BBC. The BBC only allows free use of their product for users within the UK as those users have paid for a television license that funds part of the BBC. This IP address check is not foolproof as the user may be accessing the BBC website through a [[VPN]] or [[proxy server]]. Broadcasting rights can also be restricted to allowing a broadcaster rights to distribute that content for a limited time. Channel 4's online service All 4 can only stream shows created in the US by companies such as [[HBO]] for thirty days after they are aired on one of the Channel 4 group channels. This is to boost DVD sales for the companies who produce that media.\n\nSome companies pay very large amounts for broadcasting rights with sports and US sitcoms usually fetching the highest price from UK-based broadcasters. A trend among major content producers in North America {{when|date=September 2016}} is the use of the \"[[TV Everywhere]]\" system. Especially for live content, the TV Everywhere system restricts viewership of a video feed to select [[Internet service provider]]s, usually cable television companies that pay a [[retransmission consent]] or subscription fee to the content producer. This often has the negative effect of making the availability of content dependent upon the provider, with the consumer having little or no choice on whether they receive the product.\n\n==Profits and costs==\nWith the advent of broadband Internet connections, multiple streaming providers have come onto the market in the last couple of years. The main providers are Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. Some of these providers such as Hulu advertise and charge a monthly fee. Other such as [[Netflix]] and Amazon charge users a monthly fee and have no commercials. Netflix is the largest provider; it has over 130 million members and its membership numbers are growing.{{when|date=September 2016}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/250937/quarterly-number-of-netflix-streaming-subscribers-in-the-us/|title=Netflix subscribers count in the U.S.|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> The rise of internet TV has resulted in cable companies losing customers to a new kind of customer called \"cord cutters\". [[Cord-cutting|Cord cutter]]s are consumers who are cancelling their cable TV or satellite TV subscriptions and choosing instead to [[streaming media|stream]] TV shows, movies and other content via the [[Internet]]. Cord cutters are forming communities. With the increasing availability of [[video sharing website]]s (e.g., [[YouTube]]) and streaming services, there is an alternative to cable and satellite television subscriptions. Cord cutters tend to be younger people.\n\n==Overview of platforms and availability==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Service !! Supporting company/companies !! Regional availability !!

Flagging systems can be used to warn a user that content may be certified or that it is intended for viewing post-[[Watershed (television)|watershed]]. Honour systems are also used where users are asked for their dates of birth or age to verify if they are able to view certain content.<ref>{{cite news |title=Internet en TV Vergelijken: Vandaag nog de goedkoopste aanbieding |url=https://www.internetvergelijk.nl/televisie/ |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=www.internetvergelijk.nl |agency=Roza Sinensis |language=nl}}</ref>\n\n===IPTV===\n{{main|IPTV}}\n[[IPTV]] delivers television content using signals based on the [[Internet protocol]] (IP), through the open, unmanaged Internet with the \"last-mile\" telecom company acting only as the [[Internet service provider]] (ISP). As described above, \"Internet television\" is \"over-the-top technology\" (OTT). Both IPTV and OTT use the Internet protocol over a [[packet-switched network]] to transmit data, but IPTV operates in a closed system\u2014a dedicated, managed network controlled by the local cable, satellite, telephone, or fiber-optic company.<ref>{{cite web|last=Narang|first=Nitin|title= Concept Series : What is the Difference between OTT and IPTV|url=http://www.mediaentertainmentinfo.com/2013/04/2-concept-series-what-is-the-difference-between-ott-and-iptv.html/|work=Researcher on TV technology|publisher=Media Entertainment Info|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> In its simplest form, IPTV simply replaces traditional [[circuit switched]] analog or [[digital television]] channels with digital channels which happen to use packet-switched transmission. In both the old and new systems, subscribers have [[set-top box]]es or other [[customer-premises equipment]] that communicates directly over company-owned or dedicated leased lines with central-office servers. Packets never travel over the public Internet, so the television provider can guarantee enough local bandwidth for each customer's needs.\n\nThe Internet protocol is a cheap, standardized way to enable two-way communication and simultaneously provide different data (e.g., TV-show files, email, Web browsing) to different customers. This supports DVR-like features for [[time shifting]] television: for example, to catch up on a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago, or to replay the current TV show from its beginning. It also supports [[video on demand]]\u2014browsing a catalog of videos (such as movies or television shows) which might be unrelated to the company's scheduled broadcasts.\n\nIPTV has an ongoing standardization process (for example, at the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]).\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!\n!IPTV\n!Over-the-top technology\n|-\n!Content provider\n|Local telecom\n|Studio, channel, or independent service\n|-\n!Transmission network\n|Local telecom - dedicated owned or leased network\n|Public Internet + local telecom\n|-\n!Receiver\n|Local telecom provides  (set-top box)\n|Purchased by consumer (box, stick, TV, computer, or mobile)\n|-\n!Display device\n|Screen provided by consumer\n|Screen provided by consumer\n|-\n!Examples\n| [[AT&T U-verse]], [[Bell Fibe TV]], [[Verizon Fios]] (IPTV service now discontinued)\n| [[Video on demand]] services like [[fuboTV]], [[PlayStation Vue]], [[Sky Go]], [[YouTube]], [[Netflix]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[DittoTV]], [[Yupptv|YuppTV]], [[Lovefilm]], [[BBC iPlayer]], [[Hulu]], [[Sony Liv]], [[MyTV (Arabic)|myTV]], [[Now TV (UK)|Now TV]], [[Emagine International|Emagine]], [[Sling TV|SlingTV]], KlowdTV\n|}\n\n==Streaming quality==\nStreaming quality is the quality of image and audio transmission from the servers of the distributor to the user's screen. High-definition video (720p+) and later standards require higher bandwidth and faster connection speeds than previous standards, because they carry higher spatial resolution image content. In addition, transmission packet loss and latency caused by network impairments and insufficient bandwidth degrade replay quality. Decoding errors may manifest themselves with video breakup and macro blocks. The generally accepted download rate for streaming high-definition video encoded in [[H.264]] is 3500 kbit/s, whereas standard-definition television can range from 500 to 1500 kbit/s depending on the resolution on screen. In the UK, the BBC iPlayer deals with the largest amount of traffic yet it offers HD content along with SD content. As more people have gotten broadband connections which can deal with streaming HD video over the Internet, the BBC iPlayer has tried to keep up with demand and pace. However, as streaming HD video takes around 1.5 GB of data per hour of video the BBC has had to invest a lot of money collected from License Fee payers to implement this on a large scale.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/04/bbc_iplayer_goes_hd_adds_highe.html BBC iPlayer goes HD, adds higher quality streams, releases iPlayer Desktop out of Labs], BBC Internet Blog, 20/04/2009</ref>\n\nFor users who do not have the bandwidth to stream HD video or even high-SD video, which requires 1500 kbit/s, the BBC iPlayer offers lower bitrate streams which in turn lead to lower video quality. This makes use of an adaptive bitrate stream so that if the user's bandwidth suddenly drops, iPlayer will lower its streaming rate to compensate. A diagnostic tool offered on the BBC iPlayer site measures a user's streaming capabilities and bandwidth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/diagnostics |title=BBC web page which runs a diagnostic of Internet download speeds for streaming remotely |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nInternet television is common in most US households as of the mid 2010s. About one in four new televisions being sold is now a smart TV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Connected-TVs-Reach-One-Four-Homes/1009581|title=Connected TVs Reach One in Four Homes|date=January 3, 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nConsidering the popularity of [[smart TV]]s and devices such as the Roku and Chromecast, much of the US public can watch television via the Internet. Internet-only channels are now established enough to feature some Emmy-nominated shows, such as [[Netflix]]'s ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/house-cards-season-2-sees-surge-viewers-netflix-article-1.1617972 | title='House of Cards' season 2 sees surge of Netflix viewers over first season | work=NY Daily News | date=February 18, 2014 | accessdate=July 2, 2016 | author=Dominguez, Robert}}</ref> Many networks also distribute their shows the next day to streaming providers such as [[Hulu]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com|title=Watch TV and movies on Xbox, PS3, Apple TV, and more - Hulu|work=Hulu}}</ref> Some networks may use a proprietary system, such as the [[BBC]] utilizes their [[iPlayer]] format. This has resulted in bandwidth demands increasing to the point of causing issues for some networks. It was reported in February 2014 that [[FIOS|Verizon]] is having issues coping with the demand placed on their network infrastructure. Until long-term bandwidth issues are worked out and regulation such at net neutrality Internet Televisions push to HDTV may start to hinder growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/177073-why-netflix-streaming-is-getting-slower-and-probably-wont-get-better-any-time-soon|title=Why Netflix streaming is getting slower, and probably won\u2019t get better any time soon|work=ExtremeTech}}</ref>\n\n[[Aereo]] was launched in March 2012 in New York City (and subsequently stopped from broadcasting in June 2014). It streamed network TV only to New York customers over the Internet. Broadcasters filed lawsuits against Aereo, because Aereo captured broadcast signals and streamed the content to Aereo's customers without paying broadcasters. In mid-July 2012, a federal judge sided with the Aereo start-up. Aereo planned to expand to every major metropolitan area by the end of 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/aereo-broadcasters-streams-networks-tv_n_1690173.html |title=Aereo Threatens Broadcasters By Streaming Network TV Online |date=July 20, 2012}}</ref> The Supreme Court ruled against Aereo June 24, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|date=June 25, 2014|work=CNNMoney| title=Supreme Court rules against Aereo| author=Stelter, Brian |url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/25/media/aereo-supreme-court-ruling/}}</ref>\n\n==Market competitors==\nMany providers of Internet television services exist\u2014including conventional television stations that have taken advantage of the Internet as a way to continue showing television shows after they have been broadcast, often advertised as \"on-demand\" and \"catch-up\" services. Today, almost every major broadcaster around the world is operating an Internet television platform.<ref>[http://www.international-television.org/itve/ Internet television platforms around the world] International TV Explorer</ref> Examples include the BBC, which introduced the [[BBC iPlayer]] on 25 June 2008 as an extension to its \"RadioPlayer\" and already existing streamed video-clip content, and Channel 4 that launched 4oD (\"4 on Demand\") (now All 4) in November 2006 allowing users to watch recently shown content. Most Internet television services allow users to view content free of charge; however, some content is for a fee.\n\nSince 2012, around 200 over-the-top (OTT) platforms providing streamed and downloadable content have emerged.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parksassociates.com/blog/article/pr-11092017|title=Parks Associates Announces 2017 Top 10 U.S. Subscription OTT Video Services|website=www.parksassociates.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref> Investment by [[Netflix]] in new original content for its OTT platform reached $13bn in 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/07/08/netflix-original-programming-13-billion/|title=Netflix Is Expected to Spend up to $13 Billion on Original Programming This Year|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcasting rights==\nBroadcasting rights vary from country to country and even within provinces of countries. These rights govern the distribution of copyrighted content and media and allow the sole distribution of that content at any one time. An example of content only being aired in certain countries is BBC iPlayer. The BBC checks a user's IP address to make sure that only users located in the UK can stream content from the BBC. The BBC only allows free use of their product for users within the UK as those users have paid for a television license that funds part of the BBC. This IP address check is not foolproof as the user may be accessing the BBC website through a [[VPN]] or [[proxy server]]. Broadcasting rights can also be restricted to allowing a broadcaster rights to distribute that content for a limited time. Channel 4's online service All 4 can only stream shows created in the US by companies such as [[HBO]] for thirty days after they are aired on one of the Channel 4 group channels. This is to boost DVD sales for the companies who produce that media.\n\nSome companies pay very large amounts for broadcasting rights with sports and US sitcoms usually fetching the highest price from UK-based broadcasters. A trend among major content producers in North America {{when|date=September 2016}} is the use of the \"[[TV Everywhere]]\" system. Especially for live content, the TV Everywhere system restricts viewership of a video feed to select [[Internet service provider]]s, usually cable television companies that pay a [[retransmission consent]] or subscription fee to the content producer. This often has the negative effect of making the availability of content dependent upon the provider, with the consumer having little or no choice on whether they receive the product.\n\n==Profits and costs==\nWith the advent of broadband Internet connections, multiple streaming providers have come onto the market in the last couple of years. The main providers are Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. Some of these providers such as Hulu advertise and charge a monthly fee. Other such as [[Netflix]] and Amazon charge users a monthly fee and have no commercials. Netflix is the largest provider; it has over 130 million members and its membership numbers are growing.{{when|date=September 2016}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/250937/quarterly-number-of-netflix-streaming-subscribers-in-the-us/|title=Netflix subscribers count in the U.S.|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> The rise of internet TV has resulted in cable companies losing customers to a new kind of customer called \"cord cutters\". [[Cord-cutting|Cord cutter]]s are consumers who are cancelling their cable TV or satellite TV subscriptions and choosing instead to [[streaming media|stream]] TV shows, movies and other content via the [[Internet]]. Cord cutters are forming communities. With the increasing availability of [[video sharing website]]s (e.g., [[YouTube]]) and streaming services, there is an alternative to cable and satellite television subscriptions. Cord cutters tend to be younger people.\n\n==Overview of platforms and availability==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Service !! Supporting company/companies !! Regional availability !!

He also toured [[India national cricket team|India]] with [[George Vernon]] in 1889, though this tour did not include any Tests.\n\nPhilipson went to [[Eton College|Eton]] and had a good record as a schoolboy cricketer before going to Oxford, where he got his blue and where he became captain in 1889. He also represented Oxford at tennis, rackets and Association football. His highest first-class innings was his 150 for the University against Middlesex in 1887, which is when he was selected to play for the Gentlemen at both [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]] and [[the Oval]].\n\n==Family==\nAt birth his name was registered as \"Hilton Philipson\". He was the uncle of multi-talented sportsman [[Maxwell Woosnam]], an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] champion at [[lawn tennis]] and one-time captain of the [[England national football team]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Mick|authorlink=Mick Collins|year=2006|title=All-Round Genius: The Unknown Story of Britain's Greatest Sportsman|publisher=Aurum Press Limited|location=London|isbn=1-84513-137-1}}</ref> Philipson has been described as \"one of those late Victorian gentleman amateurs quite indecently blessed by fortune\".<ref>Tim Longville, ''Country Life'', 10 January 2008</ref> He owed his own wealth to the [[Northumberland|Northumbrian]] coal mines.\n\nPhilipson married in 1896 Honourable Nina Charlotte Murray (1875\u20131966), daughter of [[Montolieu Oliphant-Murray, 1st Viscount Elibank|Montolieu Oliphant-Murray, 10th Lord Elibank]] (later created Viscount Elibank), by his wife Blanche Alice Scott. They had children:<ref>Debrett\u00b4s Peerage, 1923</ref>\n*Nina Clare Philipson (b.1899)\n*Hylton Ralph Philipson (b.1902)\n*Oliphant James Philipson (b.1905)\n\nHe lived at [[Middleton Hall, Middleton, Northumberland|Middleton Hall]] in [[Northumberland]], but in 1905 bought the estate of [[Stobo Castle]], near [[Peebles]], in the [[Scottish Borders]]. Stobo had originally been in the family of Philipson's wife, until their exile following the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]].\n\n==Gardening==\nPhilipson was a noted gardener. A visit to Japan on the way back from the Test series in Australia in 1895 inspired him to apply knowledge that he acquired there to the estate of Stobo Castle.<ref>''Country Life'', 10 January 2008</ref> The Japanese-style water garden that Philipson created at Stobo between 1909\u201313 has been maintained, despite a succession of owners after the estate was sold shortly after his death.

He also toured [[India national cricket team|India]] with [[George Vernon]] in 1889, though this tour did not include any Tests.\n\nPhilipson went to [[Eton College|Eton]] and had a good record as a schoolboy cricketer before going to Oxford, where he got his blue and where he became captain in 1889. He also represented Oxford at tennis, rackets and Association football. His highest first-class innings was his 150 for the University against Middlesex in 1887, which is when he was selected to play for the Gentlemen at both [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]] and [[the Oval]].\n\n==Family==\nAt birth his name was registered as \"Hilton Philipson\". He was the uncle of multi-talented sportsman [[Maxwell Woosnam]], an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] champion at [[lawn tennis]] and one-time captain of the [[England national football team]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Mick|authorlink=Mick Collins|year=2006|title=All-Round Genius: The Unknown Story of Britain's Greatest Sportsman|publisher=Aurum Press Limited|location=London|isbn=1-84513-137-1}}</ref> Philipson has been described as \"one of those late Victorian gentleman amateurs quite indecently blessed by fortune\".<ref>Tim Longville, ''Country Life'', 10 January 2008</ref> He owed his own wealth to the [[Northumberland|Northumbrian]] coal mines.\n\nPhilipson married in 1896 Honourable Nina Charlotte Murray (1875\u20131966), daughter of [[Montolieu Oliphant-Murray, 1st Viscount Elibank|Montolieu Oliphant-Murray, 10th Lord Elibank]] (later created Viscount Elibank), by his wife Blanche Alice Scott. They had children:<ref>Debrett\u00b4s Peerage, 1923</ref>\n*Nina Clare Philipson (b.1899)\n*Hylton Ralph Philipson (b.1902)\n*Oliphant James Philipson (b.1905)\n\nHe lived at [[Middleton Hall, Middleton, Northumberland|Middleton Hall]] in [[Northumberland]], but in 1905 bought the estate of [[Stobo Castle]], near [[Peebles]], in the [[Scottish Borders]]. Stobo had originally been in the family of Philipson's wife, until their exile following the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]].\n\n==Gardening==\nPhilipson was a noted gardener. A visit to Japan on the way back from the Test series in Australia in 1895 inspired him to apply knowledge that he acquired there to the estate of Stobo Castle.<ref>''Country Life'', 10 January 2008</ref> The Japanese-style water garden that Philipson created at Stobo between 1909\u201313 has been maintained, despite a succession of owners after the estate was sold shortly after his death. The Stobo estate was acquired in 1971 by Leo Seymour, whose family still own it (but not the castle), and the Water Gardens are occasionally open to the public.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/162/162.html CricketArchive page on Philipson]\n*[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/18516.html Cricinfo page on Philipson]\n*[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/story/155661.html Obituary of Hylton Philipson in the 1936 ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'']\n\n==External links==\n*[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Pictures/5/5244.html Last resting place for Hylton Philipson]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Philipson, Hylton}}\n[[Category:1866 births]]\n[[Category:1935 deaths]]\n[[Category:People educated at Eton College]]\n[[Category:England Test cricketers]]\n[[Category:English cricketers]]\n[[Category:Middlesex cricketers]]\n[[Category:Oxford University cricketers]]\n[[Category:People from Tynemouth]]\n[[Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Peeblesshire]]\n[[Category:I Zingari cricketers]]\n[[Category:Alumni of New College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:Gentlemen cricketers]]\n[[Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers]]\n[[Category:Gentlemen of England cricketers]]\n[[Category:C.
