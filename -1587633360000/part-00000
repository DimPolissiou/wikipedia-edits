It was organized via a Facebook group called Operation Gridlock, which was created by the Michigan Freedom Fund and the Michigan Conservative Coalition. A spokesman for the Michigan Conservative Coalition encouraged groups in other states to copy the Operation Gridlock wording and templates. Protesters in numerous other states said they were inspired by Michigan, and they used Michigan\u2019s material on their own websites, [[Facebook]] groups, and [[Reddit]] pages to promote their protests. Michigan Governor [[Gretchen Whitmer]] called attention to the fact that the Michigan Freedom Fund is funded in part by the DeVos family, but a spokesman said the family had nothing to do with the protests.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/salvadorhernandez/coronavirus-quarantine-protests-facebook-groups|title=This Is How A Group Linked To Betsy DeVos Is Organizing Protests To End Social Distancing, Now With Trump's Support|website=BuzzFeed News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> \n\nThe Trump campaign declined to answer whether it was directly involved with organizing the protest in Michigan but key organizers who did identify themselves were Meshawn Maddock, the wife of Republican Rep.

Michigan Governor [[Gretchen Whitmer]] called attention to the fact that the Michigan Freedom Fund is funded in part by the DeVos family, but a spokesman said the family had nothing to do with the protests.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/salvadorhernandez/coronavirus-quarantine-protests-facebook-groups|title=This Is How A Group Linked To Betsy DeVos Is Organizing Protests To End Social Distancing, Now With Trump's Support|website=BuzzFeed News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> \n\nThe Trump campaign declined to answer whether it was directly involved with organizing the protest in Michigan but key organizers who did identify themselves were found also to be Meshawn Maddock, the wife of Republican Rep.

[[Sun Yat-sen]] was a student in Hong Kong in the late 1800s and believed that the Qing dynasty's ineffectiveness and loss in the First Sino-Japanese War necessitated a revolution to replace Chinese dynasties with a modern republic, and began the formation of the [[Revive China Society]] in 1894 to overthrow the Qing dynasty. The Revive China Society was headquartered at 13 Staunton Street<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amo.gov.hk/en/trails_sheungwan2.php?tid=4|title=Original Site of Xing Zhong Hui (Revive China Society) Hong Kong Headquarters|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in Hong Kong, and in 1905 it was merged with other groups to form the [[Tongmenghui]].

After the success of the Xinhai Revolution, Sun Yat-sen [[History of the Republic of China|declared the establishment]] of the Republic of China on 1 January 1912, and was inaugurated as the first provisional president. Later that same year in August 1912, the Tongmenghui merged with other groups to [[History of the Kuomintang|create the Kuomintang]] (Nationalist Party), and Sun Yat-sen was chosen as its leader.\n\nSun Yat-sen returned to Hong Kong in 1923 to visit the [[University of Hong Kong]], which had incorporated the [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] as its medical school, of which Sun Yat-sen was an early alumni. During his visit at HKU, he gave a speech<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://100.hku.hk/sunyatsen/address_ENG.html|title=The Man\uff0eThe University\uff0eThe History - Sun Yat-sen|website=100.hku.hk|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> and declared Hong Kong's inspiration to him in the revolutions that eventually created the Republic of China: \"That is the answer to the question, where did I get my revolutionary ideas: it is entirely in Hong Kong.\" With Sun Yat-sen's death in 1925, [[Chiang Kai-shek|Chaing Kai-shek]] became leader of the KMT and Sun Yat-sen's successor, eventually [[Northeast Flag Replacement|unifying China]] under the Nationalist government in 1928. \n[[File:1945 liberation of Hong Kong at Cenotaph.jpg|thumb|Republic of China flag flying in Hong Kong at the Cenotaph on Liberation Day in 1945]]\nIn 1941, as the Japanese military advanced towards Hong Kong, UK Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was reluctant to defend the colony, and said that defensive troops should be reduced to a \"symbolical scale\" there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/2059530/why-churchill-didnt-want-hong-kong-defended-against-japanese-and-how|title=Why Churchill didn\u2019t want Hong Kong defended against Japanese|date=2017-01-07|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> With a [[Battle of Hong Kong|quick victory]] by the Japanese against the weakly-defended colony, the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong]] began, and both Hong Kong and Taiwan were subjects of the Empire of Japan.

Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] promised [[Soong Mei-ling]], wife of Chaing Kai-shek, that Hong Kong would be restored to Republic of China control. This was in line with longstanding United States policy; the United States, in 1899 had advocated the [[Open Door Policy]], which communicated that China should not be partitioned and colonized. The [[Nine-Power Treaty]] in 1922, signed by the British, affirmed the Open Door Policy and territorial integrity of China. In July of 1940, Winston Churchill declared in Parliament that \"We desire to see China's status and integrity preserved, and as was indicated in our Note of 14th January, 1939, we are ready to negotiate with the Chinese Government, after the conclusion of peace, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the rendition of concessions and the revision of treaties on the basis of reciprocity and equality<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1940/jul/18/transit-of-war-material-to-china|title=TRANSIT OF WAR MATERIAL TO CHINA.

The idea of territorial integrity and [[decolonization]] was further encapsulated in the 1941 [[Atlantic Charter]] statement, issued by Franklin Roosevelt (who was staunchly against colonialism<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanheritage.com/hell-hole-yours|title=\u201cThat Hell-hole Of Yours\u201d {{!}} AMERICAN HERITAGE|website=www.americanheritage.com|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>) and Winston Churchill, stipulating that \"territorial adjustments must be in accord with the wishes of the peoples concerned.\" Though Winston Churchill did not want British colonies to decolonize, he agreed to the Atlantic Charter's decolonization provisions \"to get the Americans into the war\" with military aid on the side of the Allies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/atlantic-conf|title=Milestones: 1937\u20131945 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref> On January 1st 1942, the [[Declaration by United Nations|Declaration of the United Nations]] was signed by the [[Four Policemen|Big Four]] (the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and Republic of China), stipulating that the Atlantic Charter's pledges should be upheld. This became the basis of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] in 1945.\n\nDespite the weak protection of Hong Kong and agreements by the British to the Nine-Power Treaty, Atlantic Charter, and Declaration of the United Nations, at the end of the war, the British did not want to see Hong Kong handed over to the Republic of China, and moved quickly to [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong#Post-war political stage|regain control]] of Hong Kong<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.endofempire.asia/0828-liberating-hong-kong-3/|title=Liberating Hong Kong|date=2015-08-28|website=End of Empire|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> in [[Liberation Day (Hong Kong)|1945]], preventing the unification of Hong Kong and the Republic of China (ROC). After the loss in the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, the Koumintang-ruled Republic of China government, started by Sun Yat-sen, fled to Taiwan in [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|the Great Retreat]]. Shortly after, on 6 January 1950, the [[China\u2013United Kingdom relations|UK recognized]] the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) as the government of China due to economic interests, and blocked the Republic of China government from participating in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] in 1951, which introduced the [[Political status of Taiwan|issue]] of which government Taiwan was to be surrendered to. Furthermore, in 1971, [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]] was supported by the British and passed, recognizing the PRC as the legitimate government of [[China and the United Nations|China in the UN]] rather than the Republic of China. Afterwards, the British and People's Republic of China began negotiations on the [[Handover of Hong Kong]], ultimately sealing Hong Kong's future with the PRC rather than the ROC.\n\nBoth during and after the Chinese Civil War, many people from Mainland China, including pro-Kuomintang refugees and former soldiers, fled to both [[1950s in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and Taiwan.

[[Sun Yat-sen]] was a student in Hong Kong in the late 1800s and believed that the Qing dynasty's ineffectiveness and loss in the First Sino-Japanese War necessitated a revolution to replace Chinese dynasties with a modern republic, and began the formation of the [[Revive China Society]] in 1894 to overthrow the Qing dynasty. The Revive China Society was headquartered at 13 Staunton Street<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amo.gov.hk/en/trails_sheungwan2.php?tid=4|title=Original Site of Xing Zhong Hui (Revive China Society) Hong Kong Headquarters|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> in Hong Kong, and in 1905 it was merged with other groups to form the [[Tongmenghui]].

After the success of the Xinhai Revolution, Sun Yat-sen [[History of the Republic of China|declared the establishment]] of the Republic of China on 1 January 1912, and was inaugurated as the first provisional president. Later that same year in August 1912, the Tongmenghui merged with other groups to [[History of the Kuomintang|create the Kuomintang]] (Nationalist Party), and Sun Yat-sen was chosen as its leader.\n\nSun Yat-sen returned to Hong Kong in 1923 to visit the [[University of Hong Kong]], which had incorporated the [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] as its medical school, of which Sun Yat-sen was an early alumni. During his visit at HKU, he gave a speech<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://100.hku.hk/sunyatsen/address_ENG.html|title=The Man\uff0eThe University\uff0eThe History - Sun Yat-sen|website=100.hku.hk|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> and declared Hong Kong's inspiration to him in the revolutions that eventually created the Republic of China: \"That is the answer to the question, where did I get my revolutionary ideas: it is entirely in Hong Kong.\" With Sun Yat-sen's death in 1925, [[Chiang Kai-shek|Chaing Kai-shek]] became leader of the KMT and Sun Yat-sen's successor, eventually [[Northeast Flag Replacement|unifying China]] under the Nationalist government in 1928. \n\nIn 1941, as the Japanese military advanced towards Hong Kong, UK Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was reluctant to defend the colony, and said that defensive troops should be reduced to a \"symbolical scale\" there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/2059530/why-churchill-didnt-want-hong-kong-defended-against-japanese-and-how|title=Why Churchill didn\u2019t want Hong Kong defended against Japanese|date=2017-01-07|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref> With a [[Battle of Hong Kong|quick victory]] by the Japanese against the weakly-defended colony, the [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong]] began, and both Hong Kong and Taiwan were subjects of the Empire of Japan.

Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] promised [[Soong Mei-ling]], wife of Chaing Kai-shek, that Hong Kong would be restored to Republic of China control. This was in line with longstanding United States policy; the United States, in 1899 had advocated the [[Open Door Policy]], which communicated that China should not be partitioned and colonized. The [[Nine-Power Treaty]] in 1922, signed by the British, affirmed the Open Door Policy and territorial integrity of China. In July of 1940, Winston Churchill declared in Parliament that \"We desire to see China's status and integrity preserved, and as was indicated in our Note of 14th January, 1939, we are ready to negotiate with the Chinese Government, after the conclusion of peace, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the rendition of concessions and the revision of treaties on the basis of reciprocity and equality<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1940/jul/18/transit-of-war-material-to-china|title=TRANSIT OF WAR MATERIAL TO CHINA.

The idea of territorial integrity and [[decolonization]] was further encapsulated in the 1941 [[Atlantic Charter]] statement, issued by Franklin Roosevelt (who was staunchly against colonialism<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanheritage.com/hell-hole-yours|title=\u201cThat Hell-hole Of Yours\u201d {{!}} AMERICAN HERITAGE|website=www.americanheritage.com|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>) and Winston Churchill, stipulating that \"territorial adjustments must be in accord with the wishes of the peoples concerned.\" Though Winston Churchill did not want British colonies to decolonize, he agreed to the Atlantic Charter's decolonization provisions \"to get the Americans into the war\" with military aid on the side of the Allies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/atlantic-conf|title=Milestones: 1937\u20131945 - Office of the Historian|website=history.state.gov|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref> On January 1st 1942, the [[Declaration by United Nations|Declaration of the United Nations]] was signed by the [[Four Policemen|Big Four]] (the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and Republic of China), stipulating that the Atlantic Charter's pledges should be upheld. This became the basis of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] in 1945.\n\nDespite the weak protection of Hong Kong and agreements by the British to the Nine-Power Treaty, Atlantic Charter, and Declaration of the United Nations, at the end of the war, the British did not want to see Hong Kong handed over to the Republic of China, and moved quickly to [[Japanese occupation of Hong Kong#Post-war political stage|regain control]] of Hong Kong<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.endofempire.asia/0828-liberating-hong-kong-3/|title=Liberating Hong Kong|date=2015-08-28|website=End of Empire|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-29}}</ref> in [[Liberation Day (Hong Kong)|1945]], preventing the unification of Hong Kong and the Republic of China (ROC). After the loss in the [[Chinese Civil War]] in 1949, the Koumintang-ruled Republic of China government, started by Sun Yat-sen, fled to Taiwan in [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|the Great Retreat]]. Shortly after, on 6 January 1950, the [[China\u2013United Kingdom relations|UK recognized]] the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) as the government of China due to economic interests, and blocked the Republic of China government from participating in the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] in 1951, which introduced the [[Political status of Taiwan|issue]] of which government Taiwan was to be surrendered to. Furthermore, in 1971, [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758]] was supported by the British and passed, recognizing the PRC as the legitimate government of [[China and the United Nations|China in the UN]] rather than the Republic of China. Afterwards, the British and People's Republic of China began negotiations on the [[Handover of Hong Kong]], ultimately sealing Hong Kong's future with the PRC rather than the ROC.\n\nBoth during and after the Chinese Civil War, many people from Mainland China, including pro-Kuomintang refugees and former soldiers, fled to both [[1950s in Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] and Taiwan.
