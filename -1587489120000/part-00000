It is rarely used by politicians themselves in a public context, although at certain times in Canadian history political parties have used other similarly loaded imagery.

[[Invasion of Canada (1775)|The first invasion]] was during the Revolution, under the assumption that French-speaking Canadians' presumed hostility towards British colonial rule combined with the [[Franco-American alliance]] would make them natural allies to the American cause; the [[Continental Army]] successfully recruited [[2nd Canadian Regiment|two Canadian regiments]] for the invasion. That invasion's failure forced the members of those regiments into exile, and they settled mostly in [[upstate New York]].

However, the U.S. never acted on these proposals from some U.S. politicians; some of which were never delivered or considered seriously. In 2001, El Salvador adopted the [[U.S. dollar]] as its currency, while Panama has used it for decades due to its ties to the Canal Zone.\n\n====Cuba====\nIn 1854 the [[Ostend Manifesto]] was written, outlining the rationale for the U.S. to purchase Cuba from Spain, implying taking the island by force if Spain refused.

When the U.S. battleship ''[[USS Maine (ACR-1)|Maine]]'' sank in Havana Harbor, the U.S. blamed Spain and the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] broke out in 1898. After the U.S. won, Spain relinquished claim of sovereignty over territories, including Cuba. The U.S. administered Cuba as a [[protectorate]] until 1902. Several decades later in 1959, the Cuban government of U.S.-backed [[Fulgencio Batista]] was overthrown by [[Fidel Castro]] who subsequently installed a [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] government.

Feeling that they were being unfairly exploited by the authorities on the mainland, this movement believed the best solution was to have the United States govern them.  This movement was fueled by a large number of immigrants to the United States, particularly to the [[New England]] states,  for labor and educational reasons.  Also establishing a close social connection between the Azores and the United States were American whaling companies.  New England and New York-based whaling ships frequently used the Azores as an overseas base of operations and employed large number of the local population to man the ships.  The movement to have the United States annex the Azores reached its climax during [[World War I]] when the [[United States Navy]] established a base of operations in the Azores. Sensing that the Americans were doing more to defend the Azores from the Germans than the Portuguese Government was, particularly during the raid of [[SM U-155]] on the Azores in 1917, many local politicians openly demanded a change.  American Naval officers and politicians, notably Assistant Secretary of the Navy [[Franklin Roosevelt]], however, dismissed any idea of the United States taking control.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Denmark====\nIn 1989, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' proclaimed that [[Denmark]] becomes the 51st state every [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]], because Danish citizens in and around [[Aalborg]] celebrate the American independence day.<ref>{{cite news|title=Denmark Becomes 51st State Every Fourth of July|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-02/travel/tr-4522_1_united-states|accessdate=July 4, 2011|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 2, 1989|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113051355/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-02/travel/tr-4522_1_united-states|archivedate=January 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Poland====\nPoland has historically been staunchly [[Poland&nbsp;\u2013 United States relations|pro-American]], dating back to General [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]] and [[Casimir Pulaski]]'s involvement in the [[American Revolution]].

However, the federal government rejected the version of a commonwealth that the government of Guam proposed, because its clauses were incompatible with the [[Territorial Clause]] (Art.

In 2016, Governor Eddie Calvo planned a decolonization referendum that the indigenous [[Chamorro people]] of Guam would solely participate in, in which the three options would be given, including statehood, independence, and free association. However, this referendum for the Chamorro people was struck down by a federal judge on the grounds of racial discrimination.

Talk of annexing all of Mexico disappeared after this time.\nIn 1848 a bill was debated in congress that would have annexed the [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n]], but a vote failed to take place.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yucat\u00e1n, USA?|url=http://www.theyucatantimes.com/2015/07/yucatan-usa/|accessdate=May 3, 2017|newspaper=Yucatan Times|date=July 6, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710123849/http://www.theyucatantimes.com/2015/07/yucatan-usa/|archivedate=July 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Central America====\nDue to geographical proximity of the Central American countries to the U.S. which has powerful military, economic, and political influences, there were several movements and proposals by the United States during the 19th and 20th centuries to annex some or all of the Central American republics ([[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]] with the formerly British-ruled Bay Islands, [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]] which had the U.S.-ruled [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]] territory from 1903 to 1979, and [[Belize]], which is a constitutional monarchy and was known as [[British Honduras]] until 1981). However, the U.S. never acted on these proposals from some U.S. politicians; some of which were never delivered or considered seriously. In 2001, El Salvador adopted the [[U.S. dollar]] as its currency, while Panama has used it for decades due to its ties to the Canal Zone.\n\n====Cuba====\nIn 1854 the [[Ostend Manifesto]] was written, outlining the rationale for the U.S. to purchase Cuba from Spain, implying taking the island by force if Spain refused. Once the document became published, many northern states denounced the document.\n\nIn 1859, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Slidell]] introduced a bill to purchase Cuba from Spain.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=thAwAAAAMAAJ|title=Harper's New Monthly Magazine|volume=XVIII|chapter=Monthly Record of Current Events|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=thAwAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA543#v=onepage&q&f=false|page= 543|publisher=Harper and Brothers|year=1859|isbn=978-0-938214-02-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1859/01/21/78883525.pdf|title=The Cuban Scheme|date=January 21, 1859|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 4, 2009|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nCuba, like many Spanish territories, wanted to break free from Spain. A pro-independence movement in Cuba was supported by the U.S., and Cuban guerrilla leaders wanted annexation to the United States, but Cuban revolutionary leader [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]] called for Cuban nationhood. When the U.S. battleship ''[[USS Maine (ACR-1)|Maine]]'' sank in Havana Harbor, the U.S. blamed Spain and the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] broke out in 1898. After the U.S. won, Spain relinquished claim of sovereignty over territories, including Cuba. The U.S. administered Cuba as a [[protectorate]] until 1902. Several decades later in 1959, the Cuban government of U.S.-backed [[Fulgencio Batista]] was overthrown by [[Fidel Castro]] who subsequently installed a [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] government. When the U.S. refused to trade with Cuba, Cuba allied with the Soviet Union who imported Cuban sugar, Cuba's main export. The government installed by Fidel Castro has been in power ever since.

Feeling that they were being unfairly exploited by the authorities on the mainland, this movement believed the best solution was to have the United States govern them.  This movement was fueled by a large number of immigrants to the United States, particularly to the [[New England]] states,  for labor and educational reasons.  Also establishing a close social connection between the Azores and the United States were American whaling companies.  New England and New York-based whaling ships frequently used the Azores as an overseas base of operations and employed large number of the local population to man the ships.  The movement to have the United States annex the Azores reached its climax during [[World War I]] when the [[United States Navy]] established a base of operations in the Azores. Sensing that the Americans were doing more to defend the Azores from the Germans than the Portuguese Government was, particularly during the raid of [[SM U-155]] on the Azores in 1917, many local politicians openly demanded a change.  American Naval officers and politicians, notably Assistant Secretary of the Navy [[Franklin Roosevelt]], however, dismissed any idea of the United States taking control.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n====Denmark====\nIn 1989, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' proclaimed that [[Denmark]] becomes the 51st state every [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]], because Danish citizens in and around [[Aalborg]] celebrate the American independence day.<ref>{{cite news|title=Denmark Becomes 51st State Every Fourth of July|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-02/travel/tr-4522_1_united-states|accessdate=July 4, 2011|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 2, 1989|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113051355/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-07-02/travel/tr-4522_1_united-states|archivedate=January 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Poland====\nPoland has historically been staunchly [[Poland&nbsp;\u2013 United States relations|pro-American]], dating back to General [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]] and [[Casimir Pulaski]]'s involvement in the [[American Revolution]].

Poland contributed a large force to the \"Coalition of the Willing\" in Iraq.

He was created [[Prince of Wales]] on his sixteenth birthday, nine weeks after his father succeeded as king. As a young man, Edward served in the [[British Army]] during the [[First World War]] and undertook several overseas tours on behalf of his father. While Prince of Wales, he engaged in a series of affairs that worried his father and the [[British Prime Minister]], [[Stanley Baldwin]].\n\nEdward became king on his father's death. As king, he showed impatience with court protocol, and caused concern among politicians by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions. Only months into his reign, he caused a [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|constitutional crisis]] by proposing to [[Wallis Simpson]], an American who had divorced her first husband and was seeking a divorce from her second. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective [[queen consort]]. Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as the titular head of the [[Church of England]], which at the time disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive. Edward knew the Baldwin government would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would have ruined his status as a politically neutral [[constitutional monarch]]. When it became apparent he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne, he [[abdicated]]. He was succeeded by his younger brother, [[George VI]]. With a reign of 326 days, Edward is one of the [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|shortest-reigning monarchs in British history]].\n\nAfter his abdication, Edward was created [[Duke of Windsor]]. He married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937, after her second divorce became final. Later that year, the couple [[Duke and Duchess of Windsor's 1937 tour of Germany|toured Germany]]. During the [[Second World War]], Edward was at first stationed with the [[British Military Mission to France]], but after private accusations that he was a [[Nazi sympathiser]], he was appointed [[Governor of the Bahamas]]. After the war, Edward spent the rest of his life in retirement in France. He and Wallis remained married until his death. Wallis never remarried, and stayed a widow until her death 14 years later.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:George, Duke of York, and his children.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Edward (second from left) with [[George V|his father]] and younger siblings ([[George VI|Albert]] and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Mary]]), photograph by his grandmother [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]], 1899]]\nEdward was born on 23 June 1894 at [[White Lodge, Richmond Park]], on the outskirts of London during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]].<ref>Windsor, p. 1</ref> He was the eldest son of the Duke and Duchess of York (later [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]).

In other words, no reasonable objection could have been taken if the King had decided that his exclusion from the lineal succession excluded him from the right to this title as conferred by the existing Letters Patent.\n# The question however has to be considered on the basis of the fact that, for reasons which are readily understandable, he with the express approval of His Majesty enjoys this title and has been referred to as a Royal Highness on a formal occasion and in formal documents. In the light of precedent it seems clear that the wife of a Royal Highness enjoys the same title unless some appropriate express step can be and is taken to deprive her of it.\n# We came to the conclusion that the wife could not claim this right on any legal basis. The right to use this style or title, in our view, is within the prerogative of His Majesty and he has the power to regulate it by Letters Patent generally or in particular circumstances.<ref>Attorney General to Home Secretary (14 April 1937) National Archives file HO 144/22945 quoted in Velde, Fran\u00e7ois (6 February 2006) [http://heraldica.org/topics/britain/drafting_lp1937.htm#documents_ The drafting of the letters patent of 1937].

Patrick David; 23 June 1894 \u2013 28 May 1972), was [[King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Dominion]]s of the [[British Empire]], and [[Emperor of India]], from 20 January 1936 until [[Abdication of Edward VIII|his abdication]] on 11 December of that year.\n\nEdward was born during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]] as the eldest child of the Duke and Duchess of York, later [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. He was created [[Prince of Wales]] on his sixteenth birthday, nine weeks after his father succeeded as king. As a young man, Edward served in the [[British Army]] during the [[First World War]] and undertook several overseas tours on behalf of his father. While Prince of Wales, he engaged in a series of affairs that worried his father and the [[British Prime Minister]], [[Stanley Baldwin]].\n\nEdward became king on his father's death. As king, he showed impatience with court protocol, and caused concern among politicians by his apparent disregard for established constitutional conventions. Only months into his reign, he caused a [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|constitutional crisis]] by proposing to [[Wallis Simpson]], an American who had divorced her first husband and was seeking a divorce from her second. The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions opposed the marriage, arguing a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands was politically and socially unacceptable as a prospective [[queen consort]]. Additionally, such a marriage would have conflicted with Edward's status as the titular head of the [[Church of England]], which at the time disapproved of remarriage after divorce if a former spouse was still alive. Edward knew the Baldwin government would resign if the marriage went ahead, which could have forced a general election and would have ruined his status as a politically neutral [[constitutional monarch]]. When it became apparent he could not marry Wallis and remain on the throne, he [[abdicated]]. He was succeeded by his younger brother, [[George VI]]. With a reign of 326 days, Edward is one of the [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|shortest-reigning monarchs in British history]].\n\nAfter his abdication, Edward was created [[Duke of Windsor]]. He married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937, after her second divorce became final. Later that year, the couple [[Duke and Duchess of Windsor's 1937 tour of Germany|toured Germany]]. During the [[Second World War]], Edward was at first stationed with the [[British Military Mission to France]], but after private accusations that he was a [[Nazi sympathiser]], he was appointed [[Governor of the Bahamas]]. After the war, Edward spent the rest of his life in retirement in France. He and Wallis remained married until his death. Wallis never remarried, and stayed a widow until her death 14 years later.\n== Early life ==\n[[File:George, Duke of York, and his children.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Edward (second from left) with [[George V|his father]] and younger siblings ([[George VI|Albert]] and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Mary]]), photograph by his grandmother [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]], 1899]]\nEdward was born on 23 June 1894 at [[White Lodge, Richmond Park]], on the outskirts of London during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]].<ref>Windsor, p. 1</ref> He was the eldest son of the Duke and Duchess of York (later [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]).

In other words, no reasonable objection could have been taken if the King had decided that his exclusion from the lineal succession excluded him from the right to this title as conferred by the existing Letters Patent.\n# The question however has to be considered on the basis of the fact that, for reasons which are readily understandable, he with the express approval of His Majesty enjoys this title and has been referred to as a Royal Highness on a formal occasion and in formal documents. In the light of precedent it seems clear that the wife of a Royal Highness enjoys the same title unless some appropriate express step can be and is taken to deprive her of it.\n# We came to the conclusion that the wife could not claim this right on any legal basis. The right to use this style or title, in our view, is within the prerogative of His Majesty and he has the power to regulate it by Letters Patent generally or in particular circumstances.<ref>Attorney General to Home Secretary (14 April 1937) National Archives file HO 144/22945 quoted in Velde, Fran\u00e7ois (6 February 2006) [http://heraldica.org/topics/britain/drafting_lp1937.htm#documents_ The drafting of the letters patent of 1937].

The 1912 'discovery' of [[Piltdown Man]] (a hoax), appearing much more similar to modern humans than Neanderthals, was used as evidence that multiple different and unrelated branches of primitive humans existed, and supported Boule's reconstruction of ''H. neanderthalensis'' as a far distant relative and an [[evolutionary dead-end]].<ref name=boule>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/b22463355|first=M.|last=Boule|authorlink=Marcellin Boule|year=1911|title=L'homme fossile de La Chapelle-aux-Saints|trans-title=Fossil man from La Chapelle-aux-Saints|language=French|publisher=Masson|pages=[https://archive.org/details/b22463355/page/n16 1]\u201362}}</ref><ref name=drell2000/><ref name=Reybrouck2002>{{cite journal|first=D.|last=Van Reybrouck|authorlink=David Van Reybrouck|year=2002|title=Boule's error: on the social context of scientific knowledge|journal=Antiquity|volume=76|issue=291|pages=158\u2013164|doi=10.1017/S0003598X00089936}}</ref><ref name=Langdon2016/> He fueled the popular image of Neanderthals as barbarous, slouching, club-wielding primitives; this image was reproduced for several decades and popularised in [[science fiction]] works, such as the 1911 ''[[The Quest for Fire]]'' by [[J.-H.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy may not have been driven entirely by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]], [[Elster glaciation]]), pre-Neanderthals ''[[sensu lato]]'' (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]], [[Holstein interglacial]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]], [[Saale glaciation]]\u2013[[Eemian]]), and classic Neanderthals ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (MIS 4\u20133, [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]]).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA, but different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> However, a 2020 analysis of ''H. antecessor'' enamel [[proteome]]s suggests that ''H. antecessor'' is related but not a direct ancestor.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.|last=Welker|display-authors=et al.|title=The dental proteome of ''Homo antecessor''|journal=Nature|year=2020|volume=580|issue=7802|pages=235\u2013238|doi=10.1038/s41586-020-2153-8|pmid = 32269345}}</ref> DNA studies have yielded various results on divergence time, such as 538\u2013315 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

The 1912 'discovery' of [[Piltdown Man]] (a hoax), appearing much more similar to modern humans than Neanderthals, was used as evidence that multiple different and unrelated branches of primitive humans existed, and supported Boule's reconstruction of ''H. neanderthalensis'' as a far distant relative and an [[evolutionary dead-end]].<ref name=boule>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/b22463355|first=M.|last=Boule|authorlink=Marcellin Boule|year=1911|title=L'homme fossile de La Chapelle-aux-Saints|trans-title=Fossil man from La Chapelle-aux-Saints|language=French|publisher=Masson|pages=[https://archive.org/details/b22463355/page/n16 1]\u201362}}</ref><ref name=drell2000/><ref name=Reybrouck2002>{{cite journal|first=D.|last=Van Reybrouck|authorlink=David Van Reybrouck|year=2002|title=Boule's error: on the social context of scientific knowledge|journal=Antiquity|volume=76|issue=291|pages=158\u2013164|doi=10.1017/S0003598X00089936}}</ref><ref name=Langdon2016/> He fueled the popular image of Neanderthals as barbarous, slouching, club-wielding primitives; this image was reproduced for several decades and popularised in [[science fiction]] works, such as the 1911 ''[[The Quest for Fire]]'' by [[J.-H.

Ideas such as Neanderthal behaviour, intelligence, and culture were being discussed, and a more humanlike image of them emerged.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy may not have been driven entirely by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]], [[Elster glaciation]]), pre-Neanderthals ''[[sensu lato]]'' (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]], [[Holstein interglacial]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]], [[Saale glaciation]]\u2013[[Eemian]]), and classic Neanderthals ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (MIS 4\u20133, [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]]).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA, but different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> However, a 2020 analysis of ''H. antecessor'' enamel [[proteome]]s suggests that ''H. antecessor'' is related but not a direct ancestor.<ref>{{cite journal|first=F.|last=Welker|display-authors=et al.|title=The dental proteome of ''Homo antecessor''|journal=Nature|year=2020|volume=580|issue=7802|pages=235\u2013238|doi=10.1038/s41586-020-2153-8|pmid = 32269345}}</ref> DNA studies have yielded various results on divergence time, such as 538\u2013315 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

This is the form followed by [[J. B. Bury]] in his ''History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I. to the Death of Justinian'' (1923), and it continues to be used in current literature.  Ersch & Gruber's ''Allgemeine Encyklop\u00e4die der Wissenschaften und K\u00fcnste'' reports that \"Marcus Maecilius\" and \"Flavius Maecilius\" are found on Avitus' coins, while \"Flavius Eparchius\" appears in inscriptions (vol. Appellation \u2013 Arzilla, pp. 505\u2013508, Winterhalder [1820]).  The ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' gives ''Marcus Maecilius Avitus''.  ''[[Paulys Real-Encyclop\u00e4die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft]]'' (Band II,2, col. 2395) notes that one such coin, bearing the inscription <small>M. MAECIL. AVITHUS</small> ''(sic)'', [[Joseph Hilarius Eckhel|Eckhel]], ''Doctrina Numorum Veterum'' viii. 193, was authenticated only by [[Anselmo Banduri|Banduri]], and perhaps suspect.  Some sources, including ''[[Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire]]'' and ''[[Roman Imperial Coinage]]'', give his name simply as ''Eparchius Avitus'', without further elaboration.}} c. 380/395<ref>Avitus was appointed to his first political task around 420. [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] described him as a ''iuuenis'', a \"youth\" at the time, so he was probably between the ages of 30 and 45. For ''iuuenis'' as an age category, see Andrew Gillet, \"The Birth of Ricimer,\"  ''Historia: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Alte Geschichte'', Vol. 44, No. 3, 1995, p. 383 note 23.</ref> \u2013 after 17 October 456 or in 457) was [[Western Roman Emperor]] from 8 or 9 July 455 to 17 October 456. He was a senator and a high-ranking officer both in the civil and military administration, as well as [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Piacenza-Bobbio|Bishop of Piacenza]].\n\nA [[Gallo-Roman]]  aristocrat, he opposed the reduction of the [[Western Roman Empire]] to [[Roman Italy|Italy]] alone, both politically and from an administrative point of view. For this reason, as Emperor he introduced several Gallic senators in the Imperial administration; this policy, however, was opposed by the Senatorial aristocracy and by the people of Rome, who had suffered from the [[sack of Rome (455)|sack of the city]] by the [[Vandals]] in 455.\n\nAvitus had a good relationship with the [[Visigoths]], in particular with their king [[Theodoric II]], who was a friend of his and who acclaimed Avitus Emperor. The possibility of a strong and useful alliance between the Visigoths and Romans faded, however, when Theodoric invaded [[Hispania]] at Avitus' behest, which rendered him unable to help Avitus against the rebel Roman generals who deposed him.\n\n==Biography==\n\n=== Origins and early career ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}\nAvitus was born in [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]] to a family of the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] [[Nobiles|nobility]]. His father was possibly [[Flavius Julius Agricola]], [[Roman consul|consul]] in 421. Avitus had two sons, [[Agricola (vir inlustris)|Agricola]] (fl 455 \u2013 living 507, a ''[[vir illustris]]'') and [[Ecdicius|Ecdicius Avitus]] (later ''[[patrikios|patricius]]'' and ''[[magister militum]]'' under Emperor [[Julius Nepos]]) and a daughter  [[Papianilla (wife of Sidonius Apollinaris)|Papianilla]]; she married [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], whose letters and panegyrics remain an important source for Avitus' life and times.\n\nAvitus followed a course of study typical for a young man of his rank, including law. Before 421 he was sent to the powerful ''patricius'' [[Constantius III|Flavius Constantius]] (briefly Emperor in 421) to ask for a tax reduction for his own country; this embassy was successful. His relative Theodorus was hostage at the court of the King of [[Visigoths]], [[Theodoric I]]. In 425/426 Avitus went and met him and the King, who let Avitus enter his own court. Here, around 439, Avitus met the son of Theodoric, [[Theodoric II]], who later became King. Avitus inspired the young Theodoric to study Latin poets.\n\nHe then started a military career serving under the ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] in his campaign against the [[Juthungi]] and the [[Noricum|Norics]] (430\u2013431) and against the [[Burgundians]] (436). In 437, after being elevated to the rank of ''[[vir illustris]]'', he returned to [[Clermont-Ferrand|Avernia]], where he held a high office, probably ''[[magister militum]] per Gallias''.  In the same year he defeated a group of [[Huns#Unified_Empire_under_Attila|Hunnic]] raiders near Clermont and obliged Theodoric to lift the siege of [[Narbonne]]. In 439 he became [[praetorian prefecture of Gaul|Praetorian prefect of Gaul]] and renewed the friendship treaty with the Visigoths.\n\nBefore the summer of 440, he retired to private life at his estate, ''Avitacum'', near Clermont. Here he lived until 451 when the [[Huns]], led by [[Attila]], invaded the Western Roman Empire; Avitus persuaded Theodoric into an alliance with Rome, and the combined forces of Theodoric and Aetius defeated Attila in the [[Battle of Ch\u00e2lons]]; Theodoric died in the battle.\n\n=== Rise to the throne ===\n[[File:Solidus Petronius Maximus-RIC 2201.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Petronius Maximus]], who obtained the throne at the death of [[Valentinian III]], recalled Avitus from his private life and sent him to ask for support to the Visigoths, but, at the death of Maximus, they acclaimed Avitus Emperor]]\n\nIn the late spring of 455, Avitus was recalled to service by emperor [[Petronius Maximus]] and was elevated to the rank of ''[[magister militum]]'', probably ''praesentalis''; Maximus sent Avitus in an embassy to the court of [[Theodoric II]], who had succeeded to his father, at [[Toulouse]]. This embassy probably confirmed the new king and his people as ''[[foederati]]'' of the Empire and asked for their support for the new Emperor.<ref>Petronius Maximus ascended to the throne on 17 March 455, after Emperor [[Valentinian III]] had been killed by a conspiracy in which Petronius was involved.</ref>\n\nWhile Avitus was at Theodoric's court, news came of the death of Petronius Maximus (31 May) and of the [[sack of Rome (455)|sack of Rome]] by the [[Vandals]] of [[Gaiseric]]. Theodoric acclaimed Avitus Emperor in Toulouse; on 9 July,<ref>''[[Fasti vindobonenses priores]]'' record date about 10 July.</ref> the new Emperor was acclaimed by the Gallic chiefs gathered in ''Viernum'',<ref>According to [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], vii.571\u2013579, Avitus was crowned with a [[torc]], the typical Gallic neck ring with which [[Julian (Roman emperor)|Julian]] had also been crowned.</ref> near [[Arles|Arelate (Arles)]], and later, around 5 August, before Avitus reached Rome, he received the recognition of the [[Roman Senate]].<ref>''[[Fasti vindobonenses priores]]'', n. 575; [[Cassiodorus]], 1264.</ref>\n\nAvitus stayed in Gaul for three months, to consolidate his power in the region that was the center of his support, and later went to Italy with a Gallic army, probably reinforced with a [[Goths|Gothic]] force. He probably travelled to [[Noricum]] to restore the imperial authority in that province, and then passed through [[Ravenna]], where he left a Gothic force under the new ''[[Patrikios|patricius]]'' and ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Remistus]], a Visigoth. On 21 September, finally, he entered Rome.<ref>''Auctuarium Prosperi'', 7.</ref>\n\n=== Consolidation of power ===\n\nThe effective power of Avitus depended on the support of all the major players in the Western Roman Empire in the mid-5th century. The new Emperor needed the support of both the civil institutions, the [[Roman senate]] and the Eastern Roman Emperor [[Marcian]], as well as that of the army and its commanders (the generals [[Majorian]] and [[Ricimer]]) and the [[Vandals]] of [[Gaiseric]].\n\nOn 1 January 456, Avitus took the consulate,<ref>On this occasion, [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] declamed his panegyric.</ref> as traditionally the Emperors held the consulate in the first year upon assuming the purple. However, his consulate ''sine collega'' (without a second Consul) was not recognised by the Eastern court, which nominated two consuls, [[Iohannes (consul 456)|Iohannes]] and [[Varanes (consul 456)|Varanes]].  The fact that the two courts did not agree on a couple of consuls but each nominated its own means that despite the efforts of Avitus to receive the recognition of the Eastern Emperor,<ref>[[Hydatius]] writes (''Chronicle'', 166) that Avitus sent some ambassadors to Marcian to discuss the separation of their spheres of influences, and later (''Chronicle'', 169) adds that the two emperors ruled in agreement.</ref> the relationship between the two halves of the Empire was not optimal.\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n\nTreaties under [[Marcian]] and a treaty of 442 between emperor [[Valentinian III]] and the Vandal king [[Gaiseric]] had failed to reduce Vandal incursions and raids along the Italian coast. Avitus' own efforts secured a temporary winter truce with them; but in March 456, Vandals destroyed [[Capua]]. Avitus sent [[Ricimer]] to defend [[Sicily]], and the Romans defeated the Vandals twice, once in a [[Battle of Agrigentum (456)|land battle]] near [[Agrigento]] and another in a [[Battle of Corsica|naval battle]] off [[Corsica]].<ref>See [[Priscus]], ''History'', fragment 24, and Hydatius, 176\u2013177.</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of Avitus, the [[Visigoths]] expanded into [[Hispania]], nominally under Roman authorisation but actually to promote their own interests. In 455 Avitus had sent an ambassador, ''comes'' Fronto, to the [[Suebi]] and then to [[Theodoric II]] to ask them to formally recognise Roman rule. When the Suebi invaded the Roman province of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], the Visigoths attacked and defeated them 5 October 456 at the Campus Paramus, twelve miles from [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]], on the banks of the [[\u00d3rbigo|\u00d3rbigo (Urbicus)]],<ref>E. A. Thompson, \"The End of Roman Spain. Part II\", ''Nottingham Medieval Studies'', 1977.</ref> subsequently occupying the province as nominal ''[[foederati]]'' of the Empire.\n\n=== Fall ===\n[[File:As Majorian-RIC 2646v.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Majorian]], ''[[comes domesticorum]]'' of Avitus, and [[Ricimer]], a general of barbaric descent, rebelled against their Emperor, defeated him near [[Piacenza]], and obliged him to become Bishop of the city. It was Majorian who succeeded Avitus on the throne.]]\n\nIn the meantime, resentment amongst the population of Italy against the foreigner Avitus grew. The Gallo-Roman Emperor had given to other members of the Gallo-Roman aristocracy many key offices of the public administration usually filled by Romans. Furthermore, the population of Rome, devastated by the [[sack of Rome (455)|sack of Rome]], suffered from food shortages due to the Vandal control of the naval routes, aggravated by the requirements of the foreign troops that had arrived with Avitus. The imperial treasury was almost empty and, after disbanding his Visigoth guard because of popular pressure, Avitus was obliged to pay their huge wages by melting down and selling the bronze of some statues.<ref>[[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]], fragment 202.</ref>\n\nCounting on the popular discontent, on the disbandment of the imperial guard, and on the prestige gained through their victories, [[Ricimer]] and the ''[[comes domesticorum]]'' [[Majorian]] rebelled against Avitus; the Emperor was obliged to leave Rome in early autumn and to move north. Ricimer had the Roman Senate depose Avitus and ordered the murder of the ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Remistus]] in the ''Palatium'' at [[Classe, ancient port of Ravenna]], on 17 September 456.<ref>''Fasti vindobonenses priores'', 579; ''[[Auctuarium Prosperi Havniense]]'', 1.</ref>\n\nAvitus decided to react. First he chose Messianus, one of his collaborators in his embassy to the Visigoths ordered by [[Petronius Maximus]], as the new ''magister militum''; then he probably went to Gaul ([[Hydatius]] says to [[Arles|Arelate]])<ref>Hydatius, 177.</ref> to collect all the available forces, probably the Visigoth guard he had just disbanded; finally he led his forces against the troops of Ricimer, near [[Piacenza]]. The Emperor and his army entered the city and attacked the huge army led by Ricimer, but after a great massacre of his men, including Messianus, Avitus fled on 17 or 18 October 456. In the immediate aftermath Ricimer spared his life, but forced him to become [[Bishop of Piacenza]].<ref>''Fasti vindobonenses priores'', 580 (reporting 17 October as the day of the battle); ''Auctuarium Prosperi'', ''s.a.'' 456 (reporting 18 October); Victor of Tuenna, ''s.a.'' 455 (reporting Avitus' consecration by the Bishop of Milan, Eusebius).</ref>\n\n=== Death ===\n\nAvitus' Gallic supporters may still have recognised him as emperor, despite his deposition. [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] tells of a failed ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' in Gaul organised by one Marcellus<ref>Sidonius Apollinaris, ''Letters'', i.11.6.</ref> and probably aimed at bringing Avitus back on the throne.<ref name=mathisen>Mathisen.</ref> The contemporary historian [[Hydatius]], who lived in Spain, considered the year 457 the third of Avitus' reign;<ref>Hydatius, ''Chronicle'', 183..</ref> Avitus' own intentions are not known, nor are the manner and date of his death, of which there are several versions. In some, he was told that the [[Roman Senate]] had condemned him to death, and so he tried to flee to Gaul, officially travelling there to bring donations to the basilica of Saint Julian in [[Clermont-Ferrant|Avernia]], his homeland; according to [[Gregory of Tours]], he died during this journey.<ref>Gregory of Tours, ''Historia Francorum'', ii.11.</ref> Other sources have him strangled or starved to death, by order of his successor. Avitus died in 457, or late in 456, very soon after his deposition, and was buried at [[Brioude]], next to Saint Julian's tomb.<ref>For modern scholarly analyses and list of ancient and modern sources for the circumstances of Avitus' final year and death, see Ralph W.

This is the form followed by [[J. B. Bury]] in his ''History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I. to the Death of Justinian'' (1923), and it continues to be used in current literature.  Ersch & Gruber's ''Allgemeine Encyklop\u00e4die der Wissenschaften und K\u00fcnste'' reports that \"Marcus Maecilius\" and \"Flavius Maecilius\" are found on Avitus' coins, while \"Flavius Eparchius\" appears in inscriptions (vol. Appellation \u2013 Arzilla, pp. 505\u2013508, Winterhalder [1820]).  The ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' gives ''Marcus Maecilius Avitus''.  ''[[Paulys Real-Encyclop\u00e4die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft]]'' (Band II,2, col. 2395) notes that one such coin, bearing the inscription <small>M. MAECIL. AVITHUS</small> ''(sic)'', [[Joseph Hilarius Eckhel|Eckhel]], ''Doctrina Numorum Veterum'' viii. 193, was authenticated only by [[Anselmo Banduri|Banduri]], and perhaps suspect.  Some sources, including ''[[Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire]]'' and ''[[Roman Imperial Coinage]]'', give his name simply as ''Eparchius Avitus'', without further elaboration.}} c. 380/395<ref>Avitus was appointed to his first political task around 420. [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] described him as a ''iuuenis'', a \"youth\" at the time, so he was probably between the ages of 30 and 45. For ''iuuenis'' as an age category, see Andrew Gillet, \"The Birth of Ricimer,\"  ''Historia: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Alte Geschichte'', Vol. 44, No. 3, 1995, p. 383 note 23.</ref> \u2013 after 17 October 456 or in 457) was [[Western Roman Emperor]] from 8 or 9 July 455 to 17 October 456. He was a senator and a high-ranking officer both in the civil and military administration, as well as [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Piacenza-Bobbio|Bishop of Piacenza]].\n\nA [[Gallo-Roman]]  aristocrat, he opposed the reduction of the [[Western Roman Empire]] to [[Roman Italy|Italy]] alone, both politically and from an administrative point of view. For this reason, as Emperor he introduced several Gallic senators in the Imperial administration; this policy, however, was opposed by the Senatorial aristocracy and by the people of Rome, who had suffered from the [[sack of Rome (455)|sack of the city]] by the [[Vandals]] in 455.\n\nAvitus had a good relationship with the [[Visigoths]], in particular with their king [[Theodoric II]], who was a friend of his and who acclaimed Avitus Emperor. The possibility of a strong and useful alliance between the Visigoths and Romans faded, however, when Theodoric invaded [[Hispania]] at Avitus' behest, which rendered him unable to help Avitus against the rebel Roman generals who deposed him.\n\n==Biography==\n\n=== Origins and early career ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}\nAvitus was born in [[Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont]] to a family of the [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] [[Nobiles|nobility]]. His father was possibly [[Flavius Julius Agricola]], [[Roman consul|consul]] in 421. Avitus had two sons, [[Agricola (vir illustris)|Agricola]] (fl 455 \u2013 living 507, a ''[[vir illustris]]'') and [[Ecdicius|Ecdicius Avitus]] (later ''[[patrikios|patricius]]'' and ''[[magister militum]]'' under Emperor [[Julius Nepos]]) and a daughter  [[Papianilla (wife of Sidonius Apollinaris)|Papianilla]]; she married [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], whose letters and panegyrics remain an important source for Avitus' life and times.\n\nAvitus followed a course of study typical for a young man of his rank, including law. Before 421 he was sent to the powerful ''patricius'' [[Constantius III|Flavius Constantius]] (briefly Emperor in 421) to ask for a tax reduction for his own country; this embassy was successful. His relative Theodorus was hostage at the court of the King of [[Visigoths]], [[Theodoric I]]. In 425/426 Avitus went and met him and the King, who let Avitus enter his own court. Here, around 439, Avitus met the son of Theodoric, [[Theodoric II]], who later became King. Avitus inspired the young Theodoric to study Latin poets.\n\nHe then started a military career serving under the ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] in his campaign against the [[Juthungi]] and the [[Noricum|Norics]] (430\u2013431) and against the [[Burgundians]] (436). In 437, after being elevated to the rank of ''[[vir illustris]]'', he returned to [[Clermont-Ferrand|Avernia]], where he held a high office, probably ''[[magister militum]] per Gallias''.  In the same year he defeated a group of [[Huns#Unified_Empire_under_Attila|Hunnic]] raiders near Clermont and obliged Theodoric to lift the siege of [[Narbonne]]. In 439 he became [[praetorian prefecture of Gaul|Praetorian prefect of Gaul]] and renewed the friendship treaty with the Visigoths.\n\nBefore the summer of 440, he retired to private life at his estate, ''Avitacum'', near Clermont. Here he lived until 451 when the [[Huns]], led by [[Attila]], invaded the Western Roman Empire; Avitus persuaded Theodoric into an alliance with Rome, and the combined forces of Theodoric and Aetius defeated Attila in the [[Battle of Ch\u00e2lons]]; Theodoric died in the battle.\n\n=== Rise to the throne ===\n[[File:Solidus Petronius Maximus-RIC 2201.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Petronius Maximus]], who obtained the throne at the death of [[Valentinian III]], recalled Avitus from his private life and sent him to ask for support to the Visigoths, but, at the death of Maximus, they acclaimed Avitus Emperor]]\n\nIn the late spring of 455, Avitus was recalled to service by emperor [[Petronius Maximus]] and was elevated to the rank of ''[[magister militum]]'', probably ''praesentalis''; Maximus sent Avitus in an embassy to the court of [[Theodoric II]], who had succeeded to his father, at [[Toulouse]]. This embassy probably confirmed the new king and his people as ''[[foederati]]'' of the Empire and asked for their support for the new Emperor.<ref>Petronius Maximus ascended to the throne on 17 March 455, after Emperor [[Valentinian III]] had been killed by a conspiracy in which Petronius was involved.</ref>\n\nWhile Avitus was at Theodoric's court, news came of the death of Petronius Maximus (31 May) and of the [[sack of Rome (455)|sack of Rome]] by the [[Vandals]] of [[Gaiseric]]. Theodoric acclaimed Avitus Emperor in Toulouse; on 9 July,<ref>''[[Fasti vindobonenses priores]]'' record date about 10 July.</ref> the new Emperor was acclaimed by the Gallic chiefs gathered in ''Viernum'',<ref>According to [[Sidonius Apollinaris]], vii.571\u2013579, Avitus was crowned with a [[torc]], the typical Gallic neck ring with which [[Julian (Roman emperor)|Julian]] had also been crowned.</ref> near [[Arles|Arelate (Arles)]], and later, around 5 August, before Avitus reached Rome, he received the recognition of the [[Roman Senate]].<ref>''[[Fasti vindobonenses priores]]'', n. 575; [[Cassiodorus]], 1264.</ref>\n\nAvitus stayed in Gaul for three months, to consolidate his power in the region that was the center of his support, and later went to Italy with a Gallic army, probably reinforced with a [[Goths|Gothic]] force. He probably travelled to [[Noricum]] to restore the imperial authority in that province, and then passed through [[Ravenna]], where he left a Gothic force under the new ''[[Patrikios|patricius]]'' and ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Remistus]], a Visigoth. On 21 September, finally, he entered Rome.<ref>''Auctuarium Prosperi'', 7.</ref>\n\n=== Consolidation of power ===\n\nThe effective power of Avitus depended on the support of all the major players in the Western Roman Empire in the mid-5th century. The new Emperor needed the support of both the civil institutions, the [[Roman senate]] and the Eastern Roman Emperor [[Marcian]], as well as that of the army and its commanders (the generals [[Majorian]] and [[Ricimer]]) and the [[Vandals]] of [[Gaiseric]].\n\nOn 1 January 456, Avitus took the consulate,<ref>On this occasion, [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] declamed his panegyric.</ref> as traditionally the Emperors held the consulate in the first year upon assuming the purple. However, his consulate ''sine collega'' (without a second Consul) was not recognised by the Eastern court, which nominated two consuls, [[Iohannes (consul 456)|Iohannes]] and [[Varanes (consul 456)|Varanes]].  The fact that the two courts did not agree on a couple of consuls but each nominated its own means that despite the efforts of Avitus to receive the recognition of the Eastern Emperor,<ref>[[Hydatius]] writes (''Chronicle'', 166) that Avitus sent some ambassadors to Marcian to discuss the separation of their spheres of influences, and later (''Chronicle'', 169) adds that the two emperors ruled in agreement.</ref> the relationship between the two halves of the Empire was not optimal.\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n\nTreaties under [[Marcian]] and a treaty of 442 between emperor [[Valentinian III]] and the Vandal king [[Gaiseric]] had failed to reduce Vandal incursions and raids along the Italian coast. Avitus' own efforts secured a temporary winter truce with them; but in March 456, Vandals destroyed [[Capua]]. Avitus sent [[Ricimer]] to defend [[Sicily]], and the Romans defeated the Vandals twice, once in a [[Battle of Agrigentum (456)|land battle]] near [[Agrigento]] and another in a [[Battle of Corsica|naval battle]] off [[Corsica]].<ref>See [[Priscus]], ''History'', fragment 24, and Hydatius, 176\u2013177.</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of Avitus, the [[Visigoths]] expanded into [[Hispania]], nominally under Roman authorisation but actually to promote their own interests. In 455 Avitus had sent an ambassador, ''comes'' Fronto, to the [[Suebi]] and then to [[Theodoric II]] to ask them to formally recognise Roman rule. When the Suebi invaded the Roman province of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], the Visigoths attacked and defeated them 5 October 456 at the Campus Paramus, twelve miles from [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]], on the banks of the [[\u00d3rbigo|\u00d3rbigo (Urbicus)]],<ref>E. A. Thompson, \"The End of Roman Spain. Part II\", ''Nottingham Medieval Studies'', 1977.</ref> subsequently occupying the province as nominal ''[[foederati]]'' of the Empire.\n\n=== Fall ===\n[[File:As Majorian-RIC 2646v.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Majorian]], ''[[comes domesticorum]]'' of Avitus, and [[Ricimer]], a general of barbaric descent, rebelled against their Emperor, defeated him near [[Piacenza]], and obliged him to become Bishop of the city. It was Majorian who succeeded Avitus on the throne.]]\n\nIn the meantime, resentment amongst the population of Italy against the foreigner Avitus grew. The Gallo-Roman Emperor had given to other members of the Gallo-Roman aristocracy many key offices of the public administration usually filled by Romans. Furthermore, the population of Rome, devastated by the [[sack of Rome (455)|sack of Rome]], suffered from food shortages due to the Vandal control of the naval routes, aggravated by the requirements of the foreign troops that had arrived with Avitus. The imperial treasury was almost empty and, after disbanding his Visigoth guard because of popular pressure, Avitus was obliged to pay their huge wages by melting down and selling the bronze of some statues.<ref>[[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch]], fragment 202.</ref>\n\nCounting on the popular discontent, on the disbandment of the imperial guard, and on the prestige gained through their victories, [[Ricimer]] and the ''[[comes domesticorum]]'' [[Majorian]] rebelled against Avitus; the Emperor was obliged to leave Rome in early autumn and to move north. Ricimer had the Roman Senate depose Avitus and ordered the murder of the ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Remistus]] in the ''Palatium'' at [[Classe, ancient port of Ravenna]], on 17 September 456.<ref>''Fasti vindobonenses priores'', 579; ''[[Auctuarium Prosperi Havniense]]'', 1.</ref>\n\nAvitus decided to react. First he chose Messianus, one of his collaborators in his embassy to the Visigoths ordered by [[Petronius Maximus]], as the new ''magister militum''; then he probably went to Gaul ([[Hydatius]] says to [[Arles|Arelate]])<ref>Hydatius, 177.</ref> to collect all the available forces, probably the Visigoth guard he had just disbanded; finally he led his forces against the troops of Ricimer, near [[Piacenza]]. The Emperor and his army entered the city and attacked the huge army led by Ricimer, but after a great massacre of his men, including Messianus, Avitus fled on 17 or 18 October 456. In the immediate aftermath Ricimer spared his life, but forced him to become [[Bishop of Piacenza]].<ref>''Fasti vindobonenses priores'', 580 (reporting 17 October as the day of the battle); ''Auctuarium Prosperi'', ''s.a.'' 456 (reporting 18 October); Victor of Tuenna, ''s.a.'' 455 (reporting Avitus' consecration by the Bishop of Milan, Eusebius).</ref>\n\n=== Death ===\n\nAvitus' Gallic supporters may still have recognised him as emperor, despite his deposition. [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] tells of a failed ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' in Gaul organised by one Marcellus<ref>Sidonius Apollinaris, ''Letters'', i.11.6.</ref> and probably aimed at bringing Avitus back on the throne.<ref name=mathisen>Mathisen.</ref> The contemporary historian [[Hydatius]], who lived in Spain, considered the year 457 the third of Avitus' reign;<ref>Hydatius, ''Chronicle'', 183..</ref> Avitus' own intentions are not known, nor are the manner and date of his death, of which there are several versions. In some, he was told that the [[Roman Senate]] had condemned him to death, and so he tried to flee to Gaul, officially travelling there to bring donations to the basilica of Saint Julian in [[Clermont-Ferrant|Avernia]], his homeland; according to [[Gregory of Tours]], he died during this journey.<ref>Gregory of Tours, ''Historia Francorum'', ii.11.</ref> Other sources have him strangled or starved to death, by order of his successor. Avitus died in 457, or late in 456, very soon after his deposition, and was buried at [[Brioude]], next to Saint Julian's tomb.<ref>For modern scholarly analyses and list of ancient and modern sources for the circumstances of Avitus' final year and death, see Ralph W.
