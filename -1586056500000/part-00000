Each closely follows the plot of the novels, in some cases joining several short stories. [[:it:Alberto Sironi|Alberto Sironi]], who died suddenly in early August 2019, had directed the entire series up till then.  He was taken ill during the filming of three new episodes in 2019 and [[Luca Zingaretti]] took over the direction. Camilleri was teaching at the same time as when Zingaretti was studying at the [[Accademia Nazionale di Arte Drammatica Silvio D'Amico]]. Luca Zingaretti had to adjust his accent to Sicilian having been born in Rome.\n\n[[Austrian people|Austrian]] actress [[Katharina B\u00f6hm]], then [[:sv:Lina Perned|Lina Perned]], both dubbed by [[Claudia Catani]], and now [[Sonia Bergamasco]] plays his girlfriend, Livia. [[Cesare Bocci]] plays his deputy and [[Peppino Mazzotta]] plays his most trusted detective Fazio.\nAlthough Camilleri set his books in a fictionalized version of the [[province of Agrigento]], much of the show is filmed in the [[province of Ragusa]]. The exteriors in some episodes, such as ''de la M\u00e0nnara'' ([[:it:Fornace Penna|Fornace Penna]]) were actually filmed in [[Sampieri]], while Montalbano's headquarters are in [[Scicli]], as are the offices of Commissioner Bonetti-Alderighi (actually that of the mayor of Scicli). Other scenes were filmed in [[Ragusa Ibla]], [[Modica]], [[Donnafugata Castle]], the port of [[Donnalucata]], [[Marina di Ragusa]], [[Comiso]], [[Santa Croce Camerina]], and other sites in south-eastern Sicily. The opening shots of the programme also show Guerrieri Viaduct, which is in Modica.\n\n''Inspector Montalbano'' was initially launched on [[Rai 2]]. It moved to [[Rai 1]] after the second series.\n\n==International transmission==\nThe BBC holds the [[United Kingdom]] transmission rights. \"Excursion to Tindari\" and \"Montalbano's Croquettes\" were shown in the [[UK]] on [[BBC Four]] in December 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00g31qt |title=BBC Four - Inspector Montalbano, Series 1, Excursion to Tindari |work=bbc.co.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00g6hqn |title=BBC Four - Inspector Montalbano, Series 1, Montalbano's Croquettes |work=bbc.co.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref> On 11 February 2012, \"The Snack Thief\" was broadcast in its 9 p.m. Saturday evening slot.

Each closely follows the plot of the novels, in some cases joining several short stories. [[:it:Alberto Sironi|Alberto Sironi]], who died suddenly in early August 2019, had directed the entire series up till then.  He was taken ill during the filming of three new episodes in 2019 and [[Luca Zingaretti]] took over the direction. Camilleri was teaching at the same time as when Zingaretti was studying at the [[Accademia Nazionale di Arte Drammatica Silvio D'Amico]]. Luca Zingaretti had to adjust his accent to Sicilian having been born in Rome.\n\n[[Austrian people|Austrian]] actress [[Katharina B\u00f6hm]], then [[:sv:Lina Perned|Lina Perned]], both dubbed by [[Claudia Catani]], and now [[Sonia Bergamasco]] plays his girlfriend, Livia. [[Cesare Bocci]] plays his deputy and [[Peppino Mazzotta]] plays his most trusted detective Fazio.\nAlthough Camilleri set his books in a fictionalized version of the [[province of Agrigento]], much of the show is filmed in the [[province of Ragusa]]. The exteriors in some episodes, such as ''de la M\u00e0nnara'' ([[:it:Fornace Penna|Fornace Penna]]) were actually filmed in [[Sampieri]], while Montalbano's headquarters are in [[Scicli]], as are the offices of Commissioner Bonetti-Alderighi (actually that of the mayor of Scicli). Other scenes were filmed in [[Ragusa Ibla]], [[Modica]], [[Donnafugata Castle]], the port of [[Donnalucata]], [[Marina di Ragusa]], [[Comiso]], [[Santa Croce Camerina]], and other sites in south-eastern Sicily. The opening shots of the programme also show Guerrieri Viaduct, which is in Modica.\n\n''Inspector Montalbano'' was initially launched on [[Rai 2]]. It moved to [[Rai 1]] after the second series.\n\n==International transmission==\nThe BBC holds the [[United Kingdom]] transmission rights. \"Excursion to Tindari\" and \"Montalbano's Croquettes\" were shown in the [[UK]] on [[BBC Four]] in December 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00g31qt |title=BBC Four - Inspector Montalbano, Series 1, Excursion to Tindari |work=bbc.co.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00g6hqn |title=BBC Four - Inspector Montalbano, Series 1, Montalbano's Croquettes |work=bbc.co.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref> On 11 February 2012, \"The Snack Thief\" was broadcast in its 9 p.m. Saturday evening slot.

The ion mass density provides the [[inertia]] and the [[magnetic field]] line tension provides the restoring force.\n\nThe wave propagates in the direction of the magnetic field, although waves exist at oblique incidence and smoothly change into the [[magnetosonic wave]] when the propagation is perpendicular to the magnetic field.\n\nThe motion of the ions and the perturbation of the magnetic field are in the same direction and [[transverse wave|transverse]] to the direction of propagation. The wave is [[dispersion relation|dispersionless]].\n\n==Alfv\u00e9n velocity==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}\n <!-- linked from redirect [[Alfv\u00e9n velocity]] -->\n <!-- linked from redirect [[Alfven velocity]] -->\n\nThe low-frequency [[relative permittivity]] <math>\\epsilon</math> of a magnetized plasma is given by\n\n:<math>\\epsilon = 1 + \\frac{1}{B^2}c^2 \\mu_0 \\rho</math>\n\nwhere <math>B\\,</math> is the [[magnetic field strength]], <math>c</math> is the [[speed of light]], <math>\\mu_0</math> is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of the [[vacuum]], and <math>\\rho = \\Sigma n_s m_s</math> is the total mass density of the charged plasma particles. Here, <math>s</math> goes over all plasma species, both electrons and (few types of) ions.\n\nTherefore, the phase velocity of an electromagnetic wave in such a medium is\n\n:<math>v = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}} = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{B^2}c^2 \\mu_0 \\rho}}</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>v = \\frac{v_A}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{c^2}v_A^2}}</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>v_A = \\frac{B}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}}</math>\n\nis the '''Alfv\u00e9n velocity'''. If <math>v_A \\ll c</math>, then <math>v \\approx v_A</math>. On the other hand, when <math>v_A \\rightarrow \\infty</math>, then <math>v \\approx c</math>. That is, at high field or low density, the velocity of the Alfv\u00e9n wave approaches the speed of light, and the Alfv\u00e9n wave becomes an ordinary electromagnetic wave.\n\nNeglecting the contribution of the electrons to the mass density and assuming that there is a single ion species, we get\n\n:<math>v_A = \\frac{B}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 n_i m_i}}~~</math> in SI\n:<math>v_A = \\frac{B}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi n_i m_i}}~~</math> in Gauss\n:<math>v_A \\approx (2.18\\times10^{11}\\,\\mbox{cm/s})\\,(m_i/m_p)^{-1/2}\\,(n_i/{\\rm cm}^{-3})^{-1/2}\\,(B/{\\rm gauss})</math>\n\nwhere <math>n_i</math> is the ion number density and <math>m_i</math> is the ion mass.\n\n==Alfv\u00e9n time==\nIn [[plasma physics]], the Alfv\u00e9n time <math>\\tau_A</math> is an important timescale for wave phenomena. It is related to the Alfv\u00e9n velocity by:\n:<math>\\tau_A = \\frac{a}{v_A}</math>\n\nwhere <math>a</math> denotes the characteristic scale of the system. For example, <math>a</math> could be the minor radius of the torus in a [[tokamak]].\n\n==Relativistic case==\nIn 1993, Gedalin derived the Alfv\u00e9n wave velocity using relativistic magnetohydrodynamics<ref>{{Citation |last=Gedalin |first=M. |title=Linear waves in relativistic anisotropic magnetohydrodynamics |journal=Physical Review E |volume=47 |issue=6 |pages=4354\u20134357 |date=1993 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.47.4354 |pmid=9960513 |bibcode = 1993PhRvE..47.4354G }}</ref> to be\n\n:<math>v = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{e + P}{2 P_m}}}</math>\n\nwhere <math>e\\,</math> is the total energy density of plasma particles, <math>P\\,</math> is the total plasma pressure, and <math>P_m = \\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}</math> is the [[magnetic pressure]]. In the non-relativistic limit <math>P \\ll e \\approx \\rho c^2</math>, and we immediately recover the expression from the previous section.\n\n==History==\n{{Technical|section|date=October 2012}}\n\n=== The coronal heating problem ===\nThe study of Alfv\u00e9n waves began from the [[coronal heating problem]], a longstanding question in [[heliophysics]]. It was unclear why the temperature of the [[solar corona]] is hot (about one million degrees Kelvin) compared to its surface (i.e. the [[photosphere]]), which is only a few thousand degrees. Intuitively, it would make sense to see a decrease in temperature when moving away from a heat source, but this does not seem to be the case even though the photosphere is denser and would generate more heat than the corona.\n\nIn 1942, [[Hannes Alfv\u00e9n]] proposed in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' the existence of an electromagnetic-hydrodynamic wave which would carry energy from the photosphere to heat up the corona and the [[solar wind]]. He claimed that the sun had all the necessary criteria to support these waves and they may in turn be responsible for sun spots. He stated:\n[[File:PIA19822-MagneticBlackHoleWaves-AlfvenS-waves-20150709.jpg|thumb|200px|right|<center>Magnetic waves, called Alfv\u00e9n S-waves, flow from the base of [[black hole]] jets.</center>]]\n{{Quote|text=If a conducting liquid is placed in a constant magnetic field, every motion of the liquid gives rise to an E.M.F. which produces electric currents. Owing to the magnetic field, these currents give mechanical forces which change the state of motion of the liquid. Thus a kind of combined electromagnetic-hydrodynamic wave is produced.|sign=Hannes Alfv\u00e9n, ''Existence of Electromagnetic-Hydrodynamic Waves'' |source=<ref>{{cite journal |title=Existence of Electromagnetic-Hydrodynamic Waves |author=Hannes Alfv\u00e9n|journal=Nature |volume=150 |issue=3805 |pages=405\u2013406 |date=1942 |bibcode = 1942Natur.150..405A |doi = 10.1038/150405d0}}</ref>}}\n\nThis would eventually turn out to be Alfv\u00e9n waves. He received the 1970 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this discovery.\n\n=== Experimental studies and observations ===\nThe [[convection zone]] of the sun, the region beneath the photosphere in which energy is transported primarily by [[convection]], is sensitive to the motion of the core due to the rotation of the sun. Together with varying [[pressure gradient]]s beneath the surface, [[electromagnetic fluctuation]]s produced in the convection zone induce random motion on the photospheric surface and produce Alfv\u00e9n waves. The waves then leave the surface, travel through the [[chromosphere]] and transition zone, and interact with the ionized plasma. The wave itself carries energy and some of the electrically charged plasma.\n\nIn the early 1990s, De Pontieu<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.mpe.mpg.de/Highlights/FB1997/h97-10-02.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20020716063013/http://www.mpe.mpg.de/Highlights/FB1997/h97-10-02.html |url-status = dead |archive-date = 16 July 2002 |title = Chromospheric Spicules driven by Alfv\u00e9n waves |author = Bart de Pontieu |publisher = Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr extraterrestrische Physik |date = 18 December 1997 |accessdate = 1 April 2012 }}</ref> and Haerendel<ref>{{cite journal |title=Weakly damped Alfven waves as drivers of solar chromospheric spicules|author=Gerhard Haerendel|journal=Nature |volume=360 |issue=6401|pages=241\u2013243 |date=1992 |bibcode = 1992Natur.360..241H |doi = 10.1038/360241a0 }}</ref> suggested that Alfv\u00e9n waves may also be associated with the plasma jets known as [[spicule (solar physics)|spicule]]s. It was theorized these brief spurts of superheated gas were carried by the combined energy and [[momentum]] of their own upward velocity, as well as the oscillating transverse motion of the Alfv\u00e9n waves. In 2007, Alfv\u00e9n waves were reportedly observed for the first time traveling towards the corona by Tomcyzk et al., but their predictions could not conclude that the energy carried by the Alfv\u00e9n waves was sufficient to heat the corona to its enormous temperatures, for the observed amplitudes of the waves were not high enough.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Alfven waves in the solar corona |author=Tomczyk, S. |author2=McIntosh, S.W. |author3=Keil, S.L. |author4=Judge, P.G. |author5=Schad, T. |author6=Seeley, D.H. |author7=Edmondson, J.|journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5842 |pages=1192\u20131196 |date=2007 |doi=10.1126/science.1143304 |pmid=17761876 |bibcode = 2007Sci...317.1192T }}</ref> However, in 2011, McIntosh et al. reported the observation of highly energetic Alfv\u00e9n waves combined with energetic spicules which could sustain heating the corona to its million Kelvin temperature.

In 2009, Jess et al.<ref name=\":0\" /> reported the periodic variation of [[H-alpha]] line-width as observed by [[Swedish Solar Telescope]] (SST) above [[Chromospheric activity index|chromospheric]] bright-points. They claimed first direct detection of the long-period (126-700 s) incompressible torsional Alfv\u00e9n waves in the lower solar atmosphere. After the seminal work of Jess et al. (2009), in 2017 Srivastava et al.<ref name=\":1\" /> detected the existence of high-frequency torsional Alfv\u00e9n waves in the Sun's chromospheric fine-structured [[flux tube]]s. They discovered that these high-frequency waves carry substantial energy capable of heating the Sun's corona and also in originating the supersonic solar wind. In 2018, using [[spectral imaging]] observations, non-LTE inversions and magnetic field extrapolations of sunspot atmospheres, Grant et al.<ref name=\":2\" /> found evidence for elliptically-polarized Alfv\u00e9n waves forming fast-mode shocks in the outer regions of the chromospheric umbral atmosphere. They provided quantification of the degree of physical heat provided by the dissipation of such Alfv\u00e9n wave modes above active region spots.\n\n==Historical timeline==\n\n*1942: Alfv\u00e9n suggests the existence of ''electromagnetic-hydromagnetic'' waves in a paper published in [https://www.nature.com/physics/looking-back/alfven/alfven.pdf ''Nature 150, 405\u2013406 (1942)''.]\n*1949: Laboratory experiments by S.

The ion mass density provides the [[inertia]] and the [[magnetic field]] line tension provides the restoring force.\n\nThe wave propagates in the direction of the magnetic field, although waves exist at oblique incidence and smoothly change into the [[magnetosonic wave]] when the propagation is perpendicular to the magnetic field.\n\nThe motion of the ions and the perturbation of the magnetic field are in the same direction and [[transverse wave|transverse]] to the direction of propagation. The wave is [[dispersion relation|dispersionless]].\n\n==Alfv\u00e9n velocity==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}\n <!-- linked from redirect [[Alfv\u00e9n velocity]] -->\n <!-- linked from redirect [[Alfven velocity]] -->\n\nThe low-frequency [[relative permittivity]] <math>\\epsilon</math> of a magnetized plasma is given by\n\n:<math>\\epsilon = 1 + \\frac{1}{B^2}c^2 \\mu_0 \\rho</math>\n\nwhere <math>B\\,</math> is the [[magnetic field strength]], <math>c</math> is the [[speed of light]], <math>\\mu_0</math> is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of the [[vacuum]], and <math>\\rho = \\Sigma n_s m_s</math> is the total mass density of the charged plasma particles. Here, <math>s</math> goes over all plasma species, both electrons and (few types of) ions.\n\nTherefore, the phase velocity of an electromagnetic wave in such a medium is\n\n:<math>v = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}} = \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{B^2}c^2 \\mu_0 \\rho}}</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>v = \\frac{v_A}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{c^2}v_A^2}}</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>v_A = \\frac{B}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}}</math>\n\nis the '''Alfv\u00e9n velocity'''. If <math>v_A \\ll c</math>, then <math>v \\approx v_A</math>. On the other hand, when <math>v_A \\rightarrow \\infty</math>, then <math>v \\approx c</math>. That is, at high field or low density, the velocity of the Alfv\u00e9n wave approaches the speed of light, and the Alfv\u00e9n wave becomes an ordinary electromagnetic wave.\n\nNeglecting the contribution of the electrons to the mass density and assuming that there is a single ion species, we get\n\n:<math>v_A = \\frac{B}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 n_i m_i}}~~</math> in SI\n:<math>v_A = \\frac{B}{\\sqrt{4 \\pi n_i m_i}}~~</math> in Gauss\n:<math>v_A \\approx (2.18\\times10^{11}\\,\\mbox{cm/s})\\,(m_i/m_p)^{-1/2}\\,(n_i/{\\rm cm}^{-3})^{-1/2}\\,(B/{\\rm gauss})</math>\n\nwhere <math>n_i</math> is the ion number density and <math>m_i</math> is the ion mass.\n\n==Alfv\u00e9n time==\nIn [[plasma physics]], the Alfv\u00e9n time <math>\\tau_A</math> is an important timescale for wave phenomena. It is related to the Alfv\u00e9n velocity by:\n:<math>\\tau_A = \\frac{a}{v_A}</math>\n\nwhere <math>a</math> denotes the characteristic scale of the system.

It was unclear why the temperature of the sun's [[corona]] is hot (about one million degrees Kelvin) compared to its surface (i.e. the [[photosphere]]), which is only a few thousand degrees. Intuitively, it would make sense to see a decrease in temperature when moving away from a heat source, but this does not seem to be the case even though the photosphere is denser and would generate more heat than the corona.\n\nIn 1942, [[Hannes Alfv\u00e9n]] proposed in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' the existence of an electromagnetic-hydrodynamic wave which would carry energy from the photosphere to heat up the corona and the [[solar wind]]. He claimed that the sun had all the necessary criteria to support these waves and they may in turn be responsible for sun spots. He stated:\n[[File:PIA19822-MagneticBlackHoleWaves-AlfvenS-waves-20150709.jpg|thumb|200px|right|<center>Magnetic waves, called Alfv\u00e9n S-waves, flow from the base of [[black hole]] jets.</center>]]\n{{Quote|text=If a conducting liquid is placed in a constant magnetic field, every motion of the liquid gives rise to an E.M.F. which produces electric currents.

He received the 1970 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this discovery.\n\n=== Experimental studies and observations ===\nThe [[convection zone]] of the sun, the region beneath the photosphere in which energy is transported primarily by [[convection]], is sensitive to the motion of the core due to the rotation of the sun. Together with varying [[pressure gradient]]s beneath the surface, [[electromagnetic fluctuation]]s produced in the convection zone induce random motion on the photospheric surface and produce Alfv\u00e9n waves. The waves then leave the surface, travel through the [[chromosphere]] and transition zone, and interact with the ionized plasma. The wave itself carries energy and some of the electrically charged plasma.\n\nIn the early 1990s, De Pontieu<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.mpe.mpg.de/Highlights/FB1997/h97-10-02.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20020716063013/http://www.mpe.mpg.de/Highlights/FB1997/h97-10-02.html |url-status = dead |archive-date = 16 July 2002 |title = Chromospheric Spicules driven by Alfv\u00e9n waves |author = Bart de Pontieu |publisher = Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr extraterrestrische Physik |date = 18 December 1997 |accessdate = 1 April 2012 }}</ref> and Haerendel<ref>{{cite journal |title=Weakly damped Alfven waves as drivers of solar chromospheric spicules|author=Gerhard Haerendel|journal=Nature |volume=360 |issue=6401|pages=241\u2013243 |date=1992 |bibcode = 1992Natur.360..241H |doi = 10.1038/360241a0 }}</ref> suggested that Alfv\u00e9n waves may also be associated with the plasma jets known as [[spicule (solar physics)|spicule]]s.

In 2009, Jess et al.<ref name=\":0\" /> reported the periodic variation of [[H-alpha]] line-width as observed by [[Swedish Solar Telescope]] (SST) above [[Chromospheric activity index|chromospheric]] bright-points. They claimed first direct detection of the long-period (126-700 s) incompressible torsional Alfv\u00e9n waves in the lower solar atmosphere. After the seminal work of Jess et al. (2009), in 2017 Srivastava et al.<ref name=\":1\" /> detected the existence of high-frequency torsional Alfv\u00e9n waves in the Sun's chromospheric fine-structured [[flux tube]]s. They discovered that these high-frequency waves carry substantial energy capable of heating the Sun's corona and also in originating the supersonic solar wind. In 2018, using [[spectral imaging]] observations, non-LTE inversions and magnetic field extrapolations of sunspot atmospheres, Grant et al.<ref name=\":2\" /> found evidence for elliptically-polarized Alfv\u00e9n waves forming fast-mode shocks in the outer regions of the chromospheric umbral atmosphere.

First, they are completely glassy and lack any microlites or [[phenocryst]]s, unlike terrestrial volcanic glasses. Second, although high in [[silica]] (>65 wt%), the bulk chemical and isotopic composition of tektites is closer to those of [[shale]]s and similar [[sedimentary rock]]s and quite different from the bulk chemical and isotopic composition of terrestrial volcanic glasses. Third, tektites contain virtually no water (<0.02 wt%), unlike terrestrial volcanic glasses. Fourth, the flow-banding within tektites often contains particles and bands of lechatelierite, which are not found in terrestrial volcanic glasses. Finally, a few tektites contain partly melted inclusions of [[Shocked quartz|shocked]] and unshocked mineral grains, i.e. [[quartz]], [[apatite]], and [[zircon]], as well as [[coesite]].<ref name=\"French1998a\"/><ref name=\"McCall2001a\"/><ref name=\"MontanariOthers2000a\"/>\n\nThe difference in water content can be used to distinguish tektites from terrestrial volcanic glasses. When heated to their melting point, terrestrial volcanic glasses turn into a foamy glass because of their content of water and other volatiles. Unlike terrestrial volcanic glass, a tektite produces only a few bubbles at most when heated to its melting point, because of its much lower water and other volatiles content.<ref name=\"O'Keefe1976a\">O'Keefe, J.

Those found on land have traditionally been subdivided into three groups: (1) splash-form (normal) tektites, (2) aerodynamically shaped tektites, and (3) Muong Nong-type (layered) tektites. Splash-form and aerodynamically shaped tektites are only differentiated on the basis of their appearance and some of their physical characteristics. Splash-form tektites are centimeter-sized tektites that are shaped like spheres, ellipsoids, teardrops, dumbbells, and other forms characteristic of isolated molten bodies. They are regarded as having formed from the solidification of rotating liquids, and not atmospheric ablation. Aerodynamically shaped tektites, which are mainly part of the Australasian strewn field, are splash-form tektites (buttons) which display a secondary ring or flange. The secondary ring or flange is argued as having been produced during the high-speed re-entry and ablation of a solidified splash-form tektite into the atmosphere. Muong Nong tektites are typically larger, greater than 10&nbsp;cm in size and 24&nbsp;kg in weight, irregular, and layered tektites. They have a chunky, blocky appearance, exhibit a layered structure with abundant vesicles, and contain mineral inclusions, such as zircon, [[baddeleyite]], [[chromite]], [[rutile]], [[corundum]], [[cristobalite]], and coesite.<ref name=\"French1998a\"/><ref name=\"McCall2001a\"/><ref name=\"MontanariOthers2000a\"/><ref name=\"O'Keefe1976a\"/>\n\nMicrotektites, the fourth group of tektites, are less than 1&nbsp;mm in size. They exhibit a variety of shapes ranging from spherical to dumbbell, disc, oval, and teardrop. Their colors range from colorless and transparent to yellowish and pale brown. They frequently contain bubbles and lechatelierite inclusions. Microtektites are typically found in deep-sea sediments that are of the same ages as those of the four known strewn fields.<ref name=\"McCall2001a\"/><ref name=\"MontanariOthers2000a\"/> Microtektites of the Australasian strewn field have also been found on land within Chinese loess deposits, and in sediment-filled joints and decimeter-sized weathering pits developed within glacially eroded granite outcrops of the Victoria Land Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica.<ref name=\"ChunlaiOthers1993a\">Chunlai, L., O.

Evidence for this reported tektite strewn field consists of tektites recovered from western Belize in the area of the villages of Bullet Tree Falls, Santa Familia, and Billy White. This area lies about 55&nbsp;km east-southeast of Tikal, where 13 tektites, two of which were dated as being 820,000 years old, of unknown origin were found. A limited amount of evidence is interpreted as indicating that the proposed Central American strewn field likely covers Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and possibly parts of southern Mexico.  The hypothesized Pantasma Impact Crater in northern Nicaragua might be the source of these tektites.<ref name=\"PovenmireOthers2011a\">H. Povenmire, R. S. Harris, and J. H. Cornec (2011).

The age of [[moldavite]]s, a type of tektite found in the [[Czech Republic]], was determined to be 14 million years, which agrees well with the age determined for the [[N\u00f6rdlinger Ries]] crater (a few hundred kilometers away in Germany) by radiometric dating of [[Suevite]] (an impact [[breccia]] found at the crater). Similar agreements exist between tektites from the North American strewnfield and the Chesapeake Bay impact crater and between tektites from the Ivory Coast strewnfield and the [[Lake Bosumtwi]] Crater. Ages of tektites have usually been determined by either the K-Ar method, fission-track dating, the Ar-Ar technique, or combination of these techniques.<ref name=\"French1998a\"/><ref name=\"McCall2001a\"/><ref name=\"MontanariOthers2000a\"/>\n\n== Origins ==\n=== Terrestrial source theory ===\n[[File:Tektite with bubble cavity.jpg|thumb|right|A simple, spherical splash-form Indochinite tektite]]\n\nThe overwhelming consensus of Earth and planetary scientists is that tektites consist of terrestrial debris that was ejected during the formation of an [[impact crater]]. During the extreme conditions created by an hypervelocity meteorite impact, near-surface terrestrial sediments and rocks were either melted, vaporized, or some combination of these, and ejected from an impact crater. After ejection from the impact crater, the material formed millimeter- to centimeter-sized bodies of molten material, which as they re-entered the atmosphere, rapidly cooled to form tektites that fell to Earth to create a layer of distal ejecta hundreds or thousands of kilometers away from the impact site.<ref name=\"French1998a\"/><ref name=\"McCall2001a\"/><ref name=\"MontanariOthers2000a\"/><ref name=\"Faul1966a\">Faul, Henry.

The chemical and isotopic composition of tektites indicates that they are derived from the melting of silica-rich crustal and [[sedimentary rock]]s, which are not found on the Moon. In addition, some tektites contain relict mineral inclusions ([[quartz]], [[zircon]], [[rutile]], [[chromite]], and monazite) that are characteristic of terrestrial sediments and crustal and sedimentary source rocks. Also, three of the four tektite strewnfields have been linked by their age and chemical and isotopic composition to known impact craters. A number of different geochemical studies of tektites from the Australasian strewnfield concluded that these tektites consist of melted Jurassic sediments or sedimentary rocks that were weathered and deposited about 167 [[Mya (unit)|My]] ago. Their geochemistry suggests that the source of Australasian tektites is a single sedimentary formation with a narrow range of stratigraphic ages close to 170 Mya more or less. This effectively refutes multiple impact hypotheses.<ref name=\"French1998a\"/><ref name=\"McCall2001a\"/><ref name=\"MontanariOthers2000a\"/><ref name=\"Koeberl1986a\"/><ref name=\"Koeberl1990a\"/>\n\nAlthough the formation of and widespread distribution of tektites is widely accepted to require the intense (superheated) melting of near-surface sediments and rocks at the impact site and the following high-velocity ejection of this material from the impact crater, the exact processes involved remain poorly understood. One possible mechanism for the formation of tektites is by the jetting of highly shocked and superheated melt during the initial contact/compression stage of impact crater formation. Alternatively, various mechanisms involving the dispersal of shock-melted material by an expanding vapor plume, which is created by a hypervelocity impact, have been used to explain the formation of tektites. Any mechanism by which tektites are created must explain chemical data that suggest that parent material from which tektites were created came from near-surface rocks and sediments at an impact site. In addition, the scarcity of known strewn fields relative to the number of identified impact craters indicate that very special and rarely met circumstances are required for tektites to be created by a meteorite impact.<ref name=\"French1998a\"/><ref name=\"McCall2001a\"/><ref name=\"Koeberl1986a\"/><ref name=\"Koeberl1990a\"/>\n\n=== Nonterrestrial source theories ===\n[[File:Australite back obl.jpg|thumb|right|Aerodynamically shaped australite, the button shape caused by [[ablation]] of molten glass in the atmosphere]]\n\nThough the meteorite impact theory of tektite formation is widely accepted, there has been considerable controversy about their origin in the past.

Starting with the publication of research concerning lunar samples returned from the Moon, the consensus of Earth and planetary scientists shifted in favor of theories advocating a terrestrial impact versus lunar volcanic origin. For example, one problem with the lunar origin theory is that the arguments for it that are based upon the behavior of glass melts use data from pressures and temperatures that are vastly uncharacteristic of and unrelated to the extreme conditions of hypervelocity impacts.<ref name=\"Artemieva2002a\">Artemieva N.

First, they are completely glassy and lack any microlites or [[phenocryst]]s, unlike terrestrial volcanic glasses. Second, although high in [[silica]] (>65 wt%), the bulk chemical and isotopic composition of tektites is closer to those of [[shale]]s and similar [[sedimentary rock]]s and quite different from the bulk chemical and isotopic composition of terrestrial volcanic glasses. Third, tektites contain virtually no water (<0.02 wt%), unlike terrestrial volcanic glasses. Fourth, the flow-banding within tektites often contains particles and bands of lechatelierite, which are not found in terrestrial volcanic glasses. Finally, a few tektites contain partly melted inclusions of [[Shocked quartz|shocked]] and unshocked mineral grains, i.e. [[quartz]], [[apatite]], and [[zircon]], as well as [[coesite]].<ref name=\"French1998a\"/><ref name=\"McCall2001a\"/><ref name=\"MontanariOthers2000a\"/>\n\nThe difference in water content can be used to distinguish tektites from terrestrial volcanic glasses. When heated to their melting point, terrestrial volcanic glasses turn into a foamy glass because of their content of water and other volatiles. Unlike terrestrial volcanic glass, a tektite produces only a few bubbles at most when heated to its melting point, because of its much lower water and other volatiles content.<ref name=\"O'Keefe1976a\">O'Keefe, J.

Those found on land have traditionally been subdivided into three groups: (1) splash-form (normal) tektites, (2) aerodynamically shaped tektites, and (3) Muong Nong-type (layered) tektites. Splash-form and aerodynamically shaped tektites are only differentiated on the basis of their appearance and some of their physical characteristics. Splash-form tektites are centimeter-sized tektites that are shaped like spheres, ellipsoids, teardrops, dumbbells, and other forms characteristic of isolated molten bodies. They are regarded as having formed from the solidification of rotating liquids, and not atmospheric ablation. Aerodynamically shaped tektites, which are mainly part of the Australasian strewn field, are splash-form tektites (buttons) which display a secondary ring or flange. The secondary ring or flange is argued as having been produced during the high-speed re-entry and ablation of a solidified splash-form tektite into the atmosphere. Muong Nong tektites are typically larger, greater than 10&nbsp;cm in size and 24&nbsp;kg in weight, irregular, and layered tektites. They have a chunky, blocky appearance, exhibit a layered structure with abundant vesicles, and contain mineral inclusions, such as zircon, [[baddeleyite]], [[chromite]], [[rutile]], [[corundum]], [[cristobalite]], and coesite.<ref name=\"French1998a\"/><ref name=\"McCall2001a\"/><ref name=\"MontanariOthers2000a\"/><ref name=\"O'Keefe1976a\"/>\n\nMicrotektites, the fourth group of tektites, are less than 1&nbsp;mm in size. They exhibit a variety of shapes ranging from spherical to dumbbell, disc, oval, and teardrop. Their colors range from colorless and transparent to yellowish and pale brown. They frequently contain bubbles and lechatelierite inclusions. Microtektites are typically found in deep-sea sediments that are of the same ages as those of the four known strewn fields.<ref name=\"McCall2001a\"/><ref name=\"MontanariOthers2000a\"/> Microtektites of the Australasian strewn field have also been found on land within Chinese loess deposits, and in sediment-filled joints and decimeter-sized weathering pits developed within glacially eroded granite outcrops of the Victoria Land Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica.<ref name=\"ChunlaiOthers1993a\">Chunlai, L., O.

A limited amount of evidence is interpreted as indicating that the proposed Central American strewn field likely covers Belize, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and possibly parts of southern Mexico.  The hypothesized Pantasma Impact Crater in northern Nicaragua might be the source of these tektites.<ref name=\"PovenmireOthers2011a\">H. Povenmire, R. S. Harris, and J. H. Cornec (2011).

The age of [[moldavite]]s, a type of tektite found in the [[Czech Republic]], was determined to be 14 million years, which agrees well with the age determined for the [[N\u00f6rdlinger Ries]] crater (a few hundred kilometers away in Germany) by radiometric dating of [[Suevite]] (an impact [[breccia]] found at the crater). Similar agreements exist between tektites from the North American strewnfield and the Chesapeake Bay impact crater and between tektites from the Ivory Coast strewnfield and the [[Lake Bosumtwi]] Crater. Ages of tektites have usually been determined by either the K-Ar method, fission-track dating, the Ar-Ar technique, or combination of these techniques.<ref name=\"French1998a\"/><ref name=\"McCall2001a\"/><ref name=\"MontanariOthers2000a\"/>\n\n== Origins ==\n=== Terrestrial source theory ===\n[[File:Tektite with bubble cavity.jpg|thumb|right|A simple, spherical splash-form Indochinite tektite]]\n\nThe overwhelming consensus of Earth and planetary scientists is that tektites consist of terrestrial debris that was ejected during the formation of an [[impact crater]]. During the extreme conditions created by an hypervelocity meteorite impact, near-surface terrestrial sediments and rocks were either melted, vaporized, or some combination of these, and ejected from an impact crater. After ejection from the impact crater, the material formed millimeter- to centimeter-sized bodies of molten material, which as they re-entered the atmosphere, rapidly cooled to form tektites that fell to Earth to create a layer of distal ejecta hundreds or thousands of kilometers away from the impact site.<ref name=\"French1998a\"/><ref name=\"McCall2001a\"/><ref name=\"MontanariOthers2000a\"/><ref name=\"Faul1966a\">Faul, Henry.

The chemical and isotopic composition of tektites indicates that they are derived from the melting of silica-rich crustal and [[sedimentary rock]]s, which are not found on the Moon. In addition, some tektites contain relict mineral inclusions ([[quartz]], [[zircon]], [[rutile]], [[chromite]], and monazite) that are characteristic of terrestrial sediments and crustal and sedimentary source rocks. Also, three of the four tektite strewnfields have been linked by their age and chemical and isotopic composition to known impact craters. A number of different geochemical studies of tektites from the Australasian strewnfield concluded that these tektites consist of melted Jurassic sediments or sedimentary rocks that were weathered and deposited about 167 [[Mya (unit)|My]] ago. Their geochemistry suggests that the source of Australasian tektites is a single sedimentary formation with a narrow range of stratigraphic ages close to 170 Mya more or less. This effectively refutes multiple impact hypotheses.<ref name=\"French1998a\"/><ref name=\"McCall2001a\"/><ref name=\"MontanariOthers2000a\"/><ref name=\"Koeberl1986a\"/><ref name=\"Koeberl1990a\"/>\n\nAlthough the formation of and widespread distribution of tektites is widely accepted to require the intense (superheated) melting of near-surface sediments and rocks at the impact site and the following high-velocity ejection of this material from the impact crater, the exact processes involved remain poorly understood. One possible mechanism for the formation of tektites is by the jetting of highly shocked and superheated melt during the initial contact/compression stage of impact crater formation. Alternatively, various mechanisms involving the dispersal of shock-melted material by an expanding vapor plume, which is created by a hypervelocity impact, have been used to explain the formation of tektites. Any mechanism by which tektites are created must explain chemical data that suggest that parent material from which tektites were created came from near-surface rocks and sediments at an impact site. In addition, the scarcity of known strewn fields relative to the number of identified impact craters indicate that very special and rarely met circumstances are required for tektites to be created by a meteorite impact.<ref name=\"French1998a\"/><ref name=\"McCall2001a\"/><ref name=\"Koeberl1986a\"/><ref name=\"Koeberl1990a\"/>\n\n=== Nonterrestrial source theories ===\n[[File:Australite back obl.jpg|thumb|right|Aerodynamically shaped australite, the button shape caused by [[ablation]] of molten glass in the atmosphere]]\n\nThough the meteorite impact theory of tektite formation is widely accepted, there has been considerable controversy about their origin in the past.  As early as 1897, the Dutch geologist [[Rogier Verbeek|Rogier Diederik Marius Verbeek]] (1845\u20131926) suggested an extraterrestrial origin for tektites:  he proposed that they fell to Earth from the Moon.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Verbeek|title=Over glaskogels van Billiton|journal=Verslagen van de Gewone Vergaderingen der Wis- en Natuurkundige Afdeeling (Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen te Amsterdam) [Reports of the Ordinary Sessions of the Mathematical and Physical Section (Royal Academy of Sciences at Amsterdam)]|date=1897|volume=5|pages=421\u2013425|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09FBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA421#v=onepage&q&f=false|trans-title=About the glass spheres of Billiton (now:  the island of [[Belitung]] off Sumatra, Indonesia)|language=Dutch}}  From p. 423:  ''\"Daar hiermede de aardsche bronnen voor deze lichamen uitgeput zijn, blijft er, volgens spreker, neits anders over dan aan te nemen, dat ze van buitenaardschen oorsprong zijn. \u2026 De eenige mogelijkheid is daarom, volgens spreker, dat die lichamen uitgeworpen zijn door de vulkanen van de maan.\"''  (Since earthly sources for these bodies are thereby exhausted, there remains, according to the speaker [viz, Verbeek], nothing else but to assume that they are of extraterrestrial origin. \u2026 The only possibility is therefore, according to the speaker, that these bodies have been ejected by the volcanoes of the moon.)</ref><ref group=note>As early as 1893, the Australian geologist Victor Franz Paul Streich (? \u2013 1905) suggested in a private letter to the German geologist [[Alfred Wilhelm Stelzner]] that the tektites of Australia had an extraterrestrial origin.

Starting with the publication of research concerning lunar samples returned from the Moon, the consensus of Earth and planetary scientists shifted in favor of theories advocating a terrestrial impact versus lunar volcanic origin. For example, one problem with the lunar origin theory is that the arguments for it that are based upon the behavior of glass melts use data from pressures and temperatures that are vastly uncharacteristic of and unrelated to the extreme conditions of hypervelocity impacts.<ref name=\"Artemieva2002a\">Artemieva N.

The series was named \"[[BFGoodrich]] Langstreckenmeisterschaft (BFGLM)\" from 2001 to 2009. \n\nParticipants of VLN races range from amateurs in small road legal cars with rollcages and harnesses to professional factory teams racing [[Group GT3]] cars. The VLN series is closely associated with the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]], as it has similar rules (mostly), and mainly the same participants. In the calendar, several weeks around the 24h date in May/June are taken off to allow teams to prepare for the 24h, and to fix their cars afterwards. The 24h is not part of the championship anymore, though.\n\n[[File:VLN-BFGoodrich Langstreckenmeisterschaft N\u00fcrburgring.jpg|thumb|Touring cars passing in front of the N\u00fcrburg]]\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG GT3 VLN 8 2010.JPG|thumb|[[Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG#SLS AMG GT3|Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG]] GT3 on the 'Ring]]\n\n==History==\nThe VLN was founded in 1977 by several [[motorsport]] clubs, which are members of [[ADAC]] or [[Deutscher Motorsport Verband]] (DMV), in order to join forces. Previously, each club had run its own [[touring car racing]] event on the N\u00fcrburgring, lasting for 3.5 to 6 hours, with about 150 cars and 400 drivers taking part. The rules were unified and the races were made part of a series.\n\nThe winners of the series were awarded a Cup (German ''Pokal''), sponsored by [[Ashland Inc.#Ashland Consumer Markets (Valvoline)|Valvoline]] and later Veedol lubrication products. Due to this, both organisation and races were simply informally called \"Veedol-Cup\" for many years. Since the change of sponsorship and the official recognition by [[Deutscher Motor Sport Bund]] (DMSB) as the German endurance championship (German ''Meisterschaft'') in 2001, the former ''Veedol Langstreckenpokal N\u00fcrburgring'' was the ''BFGoodrich Langstreckenmeisterschaft N\u00fcrburgring''. The name of the VLN organisation stays the same, though, which is reflected by their website addresses and title.\n\nApart from the 24 Hours, the [[Rundstrecken Challenge N\u00fcrburgring|Rundstrecken Challenge N\u00fcrburgring (RCN/CHC)]] and [[Gleichm\u00e4\u00dfigkeitspr\u00fcfung|GLP]] are related smaller events dedicated to non-professionals.\n\n==Races==\nEach VLN race is held as a \"one-day event\" on Saturdays only, in order to limit costs. The mandatory drivers briefing is at 07:30, practice is from 08:20 to 10:00, following a warmup lap behind safety cars, the first of three groups starts the race at 12:00, followed by the other two a few minutes later, in time before the fastest cars complete their first lap in just over 8 minutes. After [[parc ferm\u00e9]] is opened and the winners are honoured, the teams can travel home on race day. At some events, the schedule also accommodates additional sprint races of visiting other series, mainly [[classic car]]s and youngtimers.\n\nThe \"N\u00fcrburgring 6 Hours\" is considered the season highlight \u2013 in 1998, even Sir [[Jack Brabham]] took part, at age 72. Here, 2 to 4 drivers per cars are entered, while in all others races, a single driver can drive all alone for 4 hours, or up to 3 can form a team. There are two other standout races \u2013 the VLN-6 \"Barbarossapreis\", in which [[Michael Schumacher]]'s success with [[Scuderia Ferrari]] in [[Formula One]] is honoured with all podium placegetters receiving red wigs; and the VLN-9 \"M\u00fcnsterlandpokal\" or \"Schinkenrennen\" (ham race), where large pieces of [[ham]] from the [[M\u00fcnster]]land area are presented to class winners.\n\nMost of the fans watch the race on the Nordschleife. To get to the favourite viewing points it is often necessary to take a walk. Several sections, including \"Schwedenkreuz\", \"Adenauer Forst\", \"Karussell\", and \"Wippermann\", are up to a kilometer away from the nearest main road. Easy to reach and always well attended are sections such as \"Breidscheid\", \"Br\u00fcnnchen\", and \"Pflanzgarten\". Around the whole Nordschleife no entrance fee is raised. Just for the paddock and the grandstands on the Grand Prix circuit of the N\u00fcrburgring tickets for the price of 18 \u20ac are required.\n\n==Car classes==\nA variety of cars compete at the same time during each race. In the 2009 season, there were 30 classes of cars in four divisions.\n*The '''Series Cars''' division is intended to allow relatively low cost racing with near-series cars. It consists of six gasoline classes differentiated by engine displacement V1 to V6 and a diesel class VD.\n*The '''Specials''' division consists of pure race cars that may compete in other race series. It consists of the classes SP1 to SP8 differentiated by engine displacement with an optional suffix T for turbo charged engines, the SP9 class for FIA GT3 cars, the SP10 class for SRO GT4 cars, the special E1-XP 2009 class and the D1T to D4T classes differentiated by engine displacement for diesel cars.\n*The '''Cup''' division consists of one-make cup cars in the classes Cup1: Seat Leon, Cup2: Honda Civic R, Cup3: Porsche Carrera Cup.\n*The '''H''' division consists of cars made in 1996 and before. It consists of the classes H1 to H4 differentiated by engine displacement.\n\n==Member organisations==\n*ADAC-[[Westphalia|Westfalen]] e.V.\n*Renngemeinschaft [[D\u00fcren]] e.V.

The series was named \"[[BFGoodrich]] Langstreckenmeisterschaft (BFGLM)\" from 2001 to 2009. \n\nParticipants of VLN races range from amateurs in small road legal cars with rollcages and harnesses to professional factory teams racing [[Group GT3]] cars. The VLN series is closely associated with the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]], as it has similar rules (mostly), and mainly the same participants. In the calendar, several weeks around the 24h date in May/June are taken off to allow teams to prepare for the 24h, and to fix their cars afterwards. The 24h is not part of the championship anymore, though.\n\n[[File:VLN-BFGoodrich Langstreckenmeisterschaft N\u00fcrburgring.jpg|thumb|Touring cars passing in front of the N\u00fcrburg]]\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG GT3 VLN 8 2010.JPG|thumb|[[Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG#SLS AMG GT3|Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG]] GT3 on the 'Ring]]\n\n==History==\nThe VLN was founded in 1977 by several [[motorsport]] clubs, which are members of [[ADAC]] or [[Deutscher Motorsport Verband]] (DMV), in order to join forces. Previously, each club had run its own [[touring car racing]] event on the N\u00fcrburgring, lasting for 3.5 to 6 hours, with about 150 cars and 400 drivers taking part. The rules were unified and the races were made part of a series.\n\nThe winners of the series were awarded a Cup (German ''Pokal''), sponsored by [[Ashland Inc.#Ashland Consumer Markets (Valvoline)|Valvoline]] and later Veedol lubrication products. Due to this, both organisation and races were simply informally called \"Veedol-Cup\" for many years. Since the change of sponsorship and the official recognition by [[Deutscher Motor Sport Bund]] (DMSB) as the German endurance championship (German ''Meisterschaft'') in 2001, the former ''Veedol Langstreckenpokal N\u00fcrburgring'' was the ''BFGoodrich Langstreckenmeisterschaft N\u00fcrburgring''. The name of the VLN organisation stays the same, though, which is reflected by their website addresses and title.\n\nApart from the 24 Hours, the [[Rundstrecken Challenge N\u00fcrburgring|Rundstrecken Challenge N\u00fcrburgring (RCN/CHC)]] and [[Gleichm\u00e4\u00dfigkeitspr\u00fcfung|GLP]] are related smaller events dedicated to non-professionals.\n\n==Races==\nEach VLN race is held as a \"one-day event\" on Saturdays only, in order to limit costs. The mandatory drivers briefing is at 07:30, practice is from 08:20 to 10:00, following a warmup lap behind safety cars, the first of three groups starts the race at 12:00, followed by the other two a few minutes later, in time before the fastest cars complete their first lap in just over 8 minutes. After [[parc ferm\u00e9]] is opened and the winners are honoured, the teams can travel home on race day. At some events, the schedule also accommodates additional sprint races of visiting other series, mainly [[classic car]]s and youngtimers.\n\nThe \"N\u00fcrburgring 6 Hours\" is considered the season highlight \u2013 in 1998, even Sir [[Jack Brabham]] took part, at age 72. Here, 2 to 4 drivers per cars are entered, while in all others races, a single driver can drive all alone for 4 hours, or up to 3 can form a team. There are two other standout races \u2013 the VLN-6 \"Barbarossapreis\", in which [[Michael Schumacher]]'s success with [[Scuderia Ferrari]] in [[Formula One]] is honoured with all podium placegetters receiving red wigs; and the VLN-9 \"M\u00fcnsterlandpokal\" or \"Schinkenrennen\" (ham race), where large pieces of [[ham]] from the [[M\u00fcnster]]land area are presented to class winners.\n\nMost of the fans watch the race on the Nordschleife. To get to the favourite viewing points it is often necessary to take a walk. Several sections, including \"Schwedenkreuz\", \"Adenauer Forst\", \"Karussell\", and \"Wippermann\", are up to a kilometer away from the nearest main road. Easy to reach and always well attended are sections such as \"Breidscheid\", \"Br\u00fcnnchen\", and \"Pflanzgarten\". Around the whole Nordschleife no entrance fee is raised. Just for the paddock and the grandstands on the Grand Prix circuit of the N\u00fcrburgring tickets for the price of 18 \u20ac are required.\n\n==Car classes==\nA variety of cars compete at the same time during each race. In the 2009 season, there were 30 classes of cars in four divisions.\n*The '''Series Cars''' division is intended to allow relatively low cost racing with near-series cars. It consists of six gasoline classes differentiated by engine displacement V1 to V6 and a diesel class VD.\n*The '''Specials''' division consists of pure race cars that may compete in other race series. It consists of the classes SP1 to SP8 differentiated by engine displacement with an optional suffix T for turbo charged engines, the SP9 class for FIA GT3 cars, the SP10 class for SRO GT4 cars, the special E1-XP 2009 class and the D1T to D4T classes differentiated by engine displacement for diesel cars.\n*The '''Cup''' division consists of one-make cup cars in the classes Cup1: Seat Leon, Cup2: Honda Civic R, Cup3: Porsche Carrera Cup.\n*The '''H''' division consists of cars made in 1996 and before. It consists of the classes H1 to H4 differentiated by engine displacement.\n\n==Member organisations==\n*ADAC-[[Westphalia|Westfalen]] e.V.\n*Renngemeinschaft [[D\u00fcren]] e.V.

It is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, and contains Army National Guard units from Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Delaware, Michigan, Tennessee and Other States.<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1074</ref>\n\nFormed in 1917, the division earned the special designation \"Cyclone Division\" after the division's training camp at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, was damaged by a springtime tornado.  Deployed to France in the closing days of the Great War, the 38th Division was broken up to provide fillers for combat formations.  At the end of the war, the 38th Division demobilized and after a brief period of inactivity, was reconstituted and reorganized in the National Guard on 16 March 1923.\n\nThe 38th Division was inducted into federal service on 17 January 1941 as the United States prepared for entry into World War II.  The Division returned to Camp Shelby to reorganize as a [[triangular division|triangular infantry division]] and train for combat.  The 38th Infantry Division deployed to the Pacific theater in January 1944, initially to New Guinea where the division saw limited combat after final training.  In December, the division deployed into Leyte, Philippines to support clearing and security operations.  On 29 January 1945, the 38th Infantry Division took part in the combat landing against the Japanese held Southern Zambales Province on the island of Luzon.  Afterwards, the 38th Infantry Division took part in the operations to clear Zig Zag Pass and the Bataan peninsula, and to secure Corregidor and Manila Bay.  In recognition of their contributions in clearing the Philippines, the 38th Infantry Division received the nickname \"The Avengers of Bataan\".\n\nQuickly demobilized after World War II, the 38th Infantry Division was reorganized and federally recognized on 5 March 1947 at Indianapolis, Indiana.  During the intervening years, the 38th Infantry Division underwent numerous reorganizations while still retaining the designation as an infantry division.  The 38th Infantry Division headquarters mobilized in support of Hurricane Katrina relief operations in 2005, exercising command and control over all National Guard elements deployed in the state of Mississippi. Since 11 September 2001, units of the division have participated in Operation Enduring Freedom (in Kuwait, Afghanistan, the Balkans, Cuba, and the Horn of Africa) and Operation Iraqi Freedom.  In 2009, the 38th Infantry Division provided a headquarters element (designated Task Force Cyclone) to command and control [[counterinsurgency]] operations in [[Train Advise Assist Command - East|Regional Command East]], Afghanistan from August 2009 through June 2010.\n\nMost recently (as of October 2013), the 38th Infantry Division headquarters had responsibility for the domestic all-hazards response team (DART) mission in support of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the event of a major incident in the eastern half of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Weitzel|first=Brian|title=Indiana Army and Air Guard Personnel Part of Domestic All-Hazards Response Team|url=http://www.in.ng.mil/PublicAffairs/LatestNewsandVideoClips/tabid/831/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/846/categoryId/5/Indiana-Army-and-Air-Guard-personnel-part-of-Domestic-AllHazards-Response-Team.aspx|publisher=Indiana National Guard Public Affairs|accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Insignia==\nThe division's shoulder sleeve insignia (SSI) is a spade shaped shield, bordered in green, with the right half red, the left half blue.  Superimposed on the shield is a white monogram \"CY\" which alludes to the divisional nickname \"the Cyclone Division.\"<ref>https://www.facebook.com/38thID/photos/a.766190383426854/766190416760184/?type=3&theater</ref> The distinctive unit insignia (DUI) is in the shape of a clover leaf in memory of the original badge for non-color bearing divisional units. The lightning flashes represent the unit's participation in three World War II campaigns, with the Luzon assault landing recognized by the arrowhead tip in the center flash. The cloud and lightning flashes are an allusion to the cyclone. The colors blue, white and red refer to the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation awarded to the unit for their part in liberating the country.<ref>{{cite web|last=Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army|title=38th Infantry Division Insignia|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/HeraldryMulti.aspx?CategoryId=3661&grp=2&menu=Uniformed%20Services|work=Institute of Heraldry|accessdate=2 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103092524/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/HeraldryMulti.aspx?CategoryId=3661&grp=2&menu=Uniformed%20Services|archive-date=3 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==World War I==\nThe division was activated in August 1917 as a National Guard Division composed of units drawn from Indiana, Kentucky, and West Virginia. In keeping with new naming conventions issued by the War Department, Guard regiments were given three digit numbers (for example, the 1st Regiment, Indiana Infantry became the 151st Infantry), while Guard divisions were numbered from 26 through 42.  Guard units began movement to Camp Shelby Mississippi starting in late September 1917.  Once there the Guard units redesignated and reorganized into a \"square\" division of two brigades ([[75th Infantry Brigade (United States)|75th Infantry Brigade]] with the [[149th Infantry Regiment (United States)|149th]] and [[150th Infantry Regiment (United States)|150th Infantry Regiment]]s and the [[76th Infantry Brigade (United States)|76th Infantry Brigade]] comprised the 151st and 152nd Regiments), three field artillery regiments, with separate signal, engineer, and medical battalions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Webster|first=Leonard|title=A Military History of the Indiana National Guard 1816-1966|year=1966|publisher=Military Department of Indiana|location=Indianapolis IN|pages=27\u20138}}</ref>\n\nAfter hastily building up a base camp at Camp Shelby, the soldiers of the 38th Division began training in October 1917.  Equipment for training was chronically short, forcing leaders to fabricate dummy artillery pieces from wood and iron scrap, while the soldiers drilled with pieces of wood simulating rifles and machine guns.  In April 1918, a springtime tornado struck Camp Shelby with enough force to damage the tent city and kill one soldier.  On his assumption of command of the 38th Division on 30 August 1918, Major General Robert L. Howze commemorated the tornado by announcing the division would be known in the future as the \"Cyclone Division\".<ref>Webster (1966), pp.28\u201329</ref>\n\nThe division deployed overseas to Europe in October 1918, where it landed in France at the height of the German \"Peace Offensives\".  Because the division was not combat ready, it was largely stripped of officers and men, who served as replacements for units already in combat.  However, several of the regiments remained intact (for example the 138th and 139th Field Artillery) and were involved in collective training when the Armistice took effect on 11 November 1918.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moorhead|first=Robert L.|title=The Story of the 139th Field Artillery|url=https://archive.org/details/storyof139thfiel00moorrich|year=1920|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill|location=Indianapolis|page=[https://archive.org/details/storyof139thfiel00moorrich/page/130 130]}}</ref> The only Divisional unit to see significant action in the World War was the [[150th Field Artillery Regiment|150th Field Artillery]], which was organized from the prewar First Regiment Field Artillery.  The 150th Field Artillery was attached to the 42nd Infantry Division, and gave good service during the six major phases of the autumn 1918 offensives.<ref>{{cite book|last=No Author|title=Historical Annual of the National Guard of the State of Indiana|year=1938|publisher=Adjutant General of Indiana|location=Indianapolis|pages=326}}</ref>\n\nOf the officers and men from the 38th Division cross-leveled to other units, 301 died during the Great War:  105 died in combat; 47 died from wounds; 68 from non-combat accidents or incidents; and 81 from complications arising from influenza or pneumonia.<ref>Webster (1966), p.33</ref>\n\n*Commanders: Maj.

Howze]] (30 August 1918), Brig. Gen. F. M. Caldwell (18 October 1918), Maj. Gen. Robert L. Howze (27 October 1918).\n*Inactivated: June 1919.\n\n==Interwar period (1919-41)==\nAfter the end of the World War, the National Guard divisions briefly remained inactive while the United States rapidly demobilized and returned to a peacetime footing.  The experiences of the war convinced the War Department and Congress to retain a reserve structure in the event of a future war.  A series of amendments to the [[National Defense Act of 1916]] codified the structure of the Army of the United States to include the National Guard when in federal service. Within the text of the final amendment of August 1921 was the provision to \"preserve the names, numbers and other designations, flags and records of the divisions...that served in the World War\".<ref>{{cite book|last=No Author|title=The National Defense Act Approved June 3, 1916 as Amended|year=1921|publisher=US Government Printing Office|location=Washington D.C.|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\nAt the company level, the first units were organized by spring 1921; by November 1921 the Indiana National Guard had approximately 4,000 soldiers in an active drilling status.  Higher-level actions took longer, with the 38th Division headquarters not organized and federally recognized until March 1923, with Major General [[Robert Tyndall|Robert H. Tyndall]] as the division commander.  Tyndall well embodied the citizen-soldier concept. During the World War, Tyndall earned the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] and [[Croix de guerre 1914\u20131918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] for his successful combat leadership of the 150th Field Artillery.  In peacetime, he served as a bank vice-president and was deeply engaged in the organization of the [[American Legion]].  The majority of the divisional structure was allotted to Indiana, with the divisional headquarters established in Indianapolis.  Besides the headquarters, the 76th Infantry Brigade (with the 151st and 152nd Infantry Regiments), 139th and 150th Field Artillery Regiments, and the 113th Engineer Regiment were allotted solely to Indiana.  Kentucky organized the 75th Infantry Brigade (149th Infantry Regiment; the [[150th Infantry Regiment (United States)|150th Infantry]] was earmarked for West Virginia) and the 138th Field Artillery Regiment.  The medical, quartermaster, and division special troops elements were divided among Indiana and Kentucky.<ref>{{cite book|last=No Author|title=Pictorial History 38th Division|year=1941|publisher=Army-Navy Publishers|location=Baton Rouge LA|pages=7}}</ref>\n\n==World War II==\n*Ordered into federal service: 17 January 1941 (National Guard Division from Indiana, Kentucky, and West Virginia).\n*Overseas: 3 January 1944.\n*Campaigns: New Guinea, Southern Philippines, Luzon.\n*Distinguished Unit Citations: 1.\n*Awards: [[Medal of Honor|MH]] [[William H.

It received further training and the duty of the defense of [[Oahu]]. The division embarked from Hawaii to New Guinea, where the combat elements conducted final combat rehearsals (made realistic by the presence of bypassed Japanese troops) from July to November 1944.  Once rehearsals were complete, the 38th Infantry Division sailed for [[Leyte]], landing in December 1944. Enemy [[paratroops]] attempted to capture the Buri, Bayug, and San Pablo airstrips on 6 December. The 149th Infantry Regiment destroyed organized resistance, 11 December, and defended the strips until relieved, 4 January 1945. The division landed in the San Narciso area in Southern [[Zambales]] Province, [[Luzon]], 29 January 1945, without opposition. The [[San Marcelino]] airstrip was secured on the same day and the port facilities at [[Olongapo]] were captured on the 30th as well as [[Grande Island]] in [[Subic Bay]] after an amphibious landing. Driving west of Olongapo the 38th destroyed an intricate maze of enemy fortifications in [[Battle of Bataan (1945)|Zig-Zag Pass]].

Even after VJ Day, the division's combat outposts continued to net prisoners until the division was officially relieved on 5 October 1945.

Instead, the division was alerted on 15 September 1945 that it was to return to the United States and demobilize.  Major General Irving and key staffers flew from Manila, while the bulk of the division elements sailed from the Philippines beginning in October.  The 38th Infantry Division was directed to Camp Anza, California, for final demobilization and deactivation, which was completed on 9 November 1945.<ref>{{cite book|last=Webster|first=Leonard E.|title=A Military History of the Indiana National Guard 1816-1966|year=September 1966|publisher=The Military Department of Indiana|location=Indianapolis, IN|pages=89\u201390}}</ref>\n\nFor a time, the 38th Infantry Division remained inactivated while debate raged within the federal government as to the size, scope and even the necessity for a separate Army National Guard.  In October 1945, the War Department issued directives to reconstitute the Army National Guard as an integral part of the Reserve Component which still retained the unique dual nature of the pre-war Guard.  First priority under the new plan was the organization and reactivation of eighteen division headquarters, one of which was the 38th Infantry Division.<ref>{{cite book|last=No Author|title=I Am the Guard:  A History of the Army National Guard 1636-2000|year=2000|publisher=National Guard Bureau|location=Crystal City, VA|pages=194\u2013197}}</ref>\n\nWithin Indiana, organizational actions were already in the works led by Indiana Adjutant General Ben H. Watt.  By March 1946, Watt submitted a proposed recruitment quota to the National Guard Bureau (NGB), and designated commanders in anticipation of receiving approval for the reorganizing units.  Receiving approval from NGB in October 1946, Indiana began organizing and reconstituting the subordinate elements of the 38th Infantry Division.  Unit strength grew quickly, swelled by large numbers of World War II veterans.  The influx of tested combat leaders facilitated the activation of the Headquarters and Special Troops unit of the 38th Infantry Division, which officially organized in Indianapolis on 6 October 1946, and received federal recognition on 5 March 1947.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Robert|title=The Longest Arm|year=1995|publisher=Unpublished Manuscript|location=Indianapolis, IN|page=12}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the pre-war 38th Division, the post-war 38th Infantry Division force structure was allotted entirely to Indiana, and consisted of a triangular structure (three infantry regiments, with three line battalions per regiment) with a total authorization of 16,241 officers, non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and soldiers.  Despite an aggressive recruiting campaign, the Division's subordinate units were not sufficiently organized to permit Annual Training (AT) at [https://web.archive.org/web/20130208223022/http://www.campatterbury.in.ng.mil/AboutUs/CampAtterburyHistory/tabid/1591/Default.aspx Camp Atterbury] until 1948.<ref>Webster (1966), p.93</ref><ref>Fischer (1995), p.18</ref>\n\nIn 1959, the 38th Infantry Division underwent the first major reorganization since the War, with the regiments converted into [[Pentomic]] battle groups by the inclusion of fire support and logistics elements as organic parts of the combat formation.  In 1968, the division was the first reserve organization to reorganize under the Army's Reorganization Objective of the Army Division ([[History of the United States Army|ROAD]]) concept, which included three brigade headquarters tailored by the attachment of combat and support battalions. Accompanying the ROAD reorganization was the return to multi-state aspect of the pre-war division, with the division headquarters, divisional artillery, and the 76th Infantry Brigade stationed in Indiana, with the remaining two infantry brigades organized in Ohio and Michigan.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Watt|editor-first=William|title=''Indiana's Citizen Soldiers:  The Militia and National Guard in Indiana History''|year=1980|publisher=The Indiana State Armory Board|location=Indianapolis IN|pages=187\u201388}}</ref> In 1994, the division headquarters reorganized as a mechanized infantry division headquarters, a designation which it retained until 2008.<ref>{{cite book|last=No Author|title=Permanent Orders 072-001|date=22 August 1994|publisher=Military Department of Indiana|location=Indianapolis IN}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], the 38th Infantry Division formed part of the Strategic Reserve to support the Active Army in the event of a full-scale war with the [[Soviet Union]] and her satellites.

The governor of Mississippi appealed to other states for National Guard units to assist in the response.  The rapid influx of Guard units from various states, although sorely needed, overwhelmed the Mississippi National Guard's ability to coordinate the military efforts.  Accordingly, National Guard Bureau activated the headquarters of the 38th Infantry Division on 30 August to deploy to Mississippi and assist the Mississippi Adjutant General (TAG) with command and control efforts.  Commanded by Major General (MG) Gregory Vadnais, the advanced party of the division deployed on 31 August 2005, while the main body departed Indianapolis by convoy on Saturday, 3 September 2005.  Organized as Task Force (TF) Cyclone, the Division established command post operations in Gulfport Mississippi, focused on providing local security, road clearance, and delivery of essential humanitarian assistance.  By the time TF Cyclone fully assumed mission on 4 September, roughly 7500 Guardsmen were on duty inside Mississippi.

Upon arrival in Al Anbar Province, the unit was operationally assigned to the 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division's \"Ready First Combat Team\" and conducted extensive joint patrols and enemy clearing operations in both the Ramadi and Fallujah AOs during some of the most intense fighting of the 2006\u201307 campaign. One platoon would be assigned under the tactical control of USMC Regimental Combat Teams in the Fallujah AO, with the rest of the company being assigned to the Ready First Brigade in Ramadi. The company would also have a platoon from the Minnesota National Guard under its operational control.\n\nWhen the Ready First Brigade departed Ramadi, the company would be assigned to a new brigade, 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division (Raider Brigade), and it would participate in major clearing operations during the Surge of 2007.\n\nThe company had many soldiers who committed numerous acts of heroism that have not been truly known to this day.

It is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, and contains Army National Guard units from Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Delaware, Michigan, Tennessee and Other States.<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1074</ref>\n\nFormed in 1917, the division earned the special designation \"Cyclone Division\" after the division's training camp at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, was damaged by a springtime tornado.  Deployed to France in the closing days of the Great War, the 38th Division was broken up to provide fillers for combat formations.  At the end of the war, the 38th Division demobilized and after a brief period of inactivity, was reconstituted and reorganized in the National Guard on 16 March 1923.\n\nThe 38th Division was inducted into federal service on 17 January 1941 as the United States prepared for entry into World War II.  The Division returned to Camp Shelby to reorganize as a [[triangular division|triangular infantry division]] and train for combat.  The 38th Infantry Division deployed to the Pacific theater in January 1944, initially to New Guinea where the division saw limited combat after final training.  In December, the division deployed into Leyte, Philippines to support clearing and security operations.  On 29 January 1945, the 38th Infantry Division took part in the combat landing against the Japanese held Southern Zambales Province on the island of Luzon.  Afterwards, the 38th Infantry Division took part in the operations to clear Zig Zag Pass and the Bataan peninsula, and to secure Corregidor and Manila Bay.  In recognition of their contributions in clearing the Philippines, the 38th Infantry Division received the nickname \"The Avengers of Bataan\".\n\nQuickly demobilized after World War II, the 38th Infantry Division was reorganized and federally recognized on 5 March 1947 at Indianapolis, Indiana.  During the intervening years, the 38th Infantry Division underwent numerous reorganizations while still retaining the designation as an infantry division.  The 38th Infantry Division headquarters mobilized in support of Hurricane Katrina relief operations in 2005, exercising command and control over all National Guard elements deployed in the state of Mississippi. Since 11 September 2001, units of the division have participated in Operation Enduring Freedom (in Kuwait, Afghanistan, the Balkans, Cuba, and the Horn of Africa) and Operation Iraqi Freedom.  In 2009, the 38th Infantry Division provided a headquarters element (designated Task Force Cyclone) to command and control [[counterinsurgency]] operations in [[Train Advise Assist Command - East|Regional Command East]], Afghanistan from August 2009 through June 2010.\n\nMost recently (as of October 2013), the 38th Infantry Division headquarters had responsibility for the domestic all-hazards response team (DART) mission in support of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the event of a major incident in the eastern half of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Weitzel|first=Brian|title=Indiana Army and Air Guard Personnel Part of Domestic All-Hazards Response Team|url=http://www.in.ng.mil/PublicAffairs/LatestNewsandVideoClips/tabid/831/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/846/categoryId/5/Indiana-Army-and-Air-Guard-personnel-part-of-Domestic-AllHazards-Response-Team.aspx|publisher=Indiana National Guard Public Affairs|accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Insignia==\nThe division's shoulder sleeve insignia (SSI) is a spade shaped shield, bordered in green, with the right half red, the left half blue.

The lightning flashes represent the unit's participation in three World War II campaigns, with the Luzon assault landing recognized by the arrowhead tip in the center flash. The cloud and lightning flashes are an allusion to the cyclone. The colors blue, white and red refer to the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation awarded to the unit for their part in liberating the country.<ref>{{cite web|last=Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army|title=38th Infantry Division Insignia|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/HeraldryMulti.aspx?CategoryId=3661&grp=2&menu=Uniformed%20Services|work=Institute of Heraldry|accessdate=2 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103092524/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/HeraldryMulti.aspx?CategoryId=3661&grp=2&menu=Uniformed%20Services|archive-date=3 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==World War I==\nThe division was activated in August 1917 as a National Guard Division composed of units drawn from Indiana, Kentucky, and West Virginia. In keeping with new naming conventions issued by the War Department, Guard regiments were given three digit numbers (for example, the 1st Regiment, Indiana Infantry became the 151st Infantry), while Guard divisions were numbered from 26 through 42.  Guard units began movement to Camp Shelby Mississippi starting in late September 1917.  Once there the Guard units redesignated and reorganized into a \"square\" division of two brigades ([[75th Infantry Brigade (United States)|75th Infantry Brigade]] with the [[149th Infantry Regiment (United States)|149th]] and [[150th Infantry Regiment (United States)|150th Infantry Regiment]]s and the [[76th Infantry Brigade (United States)|76th Infantry Brigade]] comprised the 151st and 152nd Regiments), three field artillery regiments, with separate signal, engineer, and medical battalions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Webster|first=Leonard|title=A Military History of the Indiana National Guard 1816-1966|year=1966|publisher=Military Department of Indiana|location=Indianapolis IN|pages=27\u20138}}</ref>\n\nAfter hastily building up a base camp at Camp Shelby, the soldiers of the 38th Division began training in October 1917.  Equipment for training was chronically short, forcing leaders to fabricate dummy artillery pieces from wood and iron scrap, while the soldiers drilled with pieces of wood simulating rifles and machine guns.  In April 1918, a springtime tornado struck Camp Shelby with enough force to damage the tent city and kill one soldier.  On his assumption of command of the 38th Division on 30 August 1918, Major General Robert L. Howze commemorated the tornado by announcing the division would be known in the future as the \"Cyclone Division\".<ref>Webster (1966), pp.28\u201329</ref>\n\nThe division deployed overseas to Europe in October 1918, where it landed in France at the height of the German \"Peace Offensives\".  Because the division was not combat ready, it was largely stripped of officers and men, who served as replacements for units already in combat.  However, several of the regiments remained intact (for example the 138th and 139th Field Artillery) and were involved in collective training when the Armistice took effect on 11 November 1918.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moorhead|first=Robert L.|title=The Story of the 139th Field Artillery|url=https://archive.org/details/storyof139thfiel00moorrich|year=1920|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill|location=Indianapolis|page=[https://archive.org/details/storyof139thfiel00moorrich/page/130 130]}}</ref> The only Divisional unit to see significant action in the World War was the [[150th Field Artillery Regiment|150th Field Artillery]], which was organized from the prewar First Regiment Field Artillery.  The 150th Field Artillery was attached to the 42nd Infantry Division, and gave good service during the six major phases of the autumn 1918 offensives.<ref>{{cite book|last=No Author|title=Historical Annual of the National Guard of the State of Indiana|year=1938|publisher=Adjutant General of Indiana|location=Indianapolis|pages=326}}</ref>\n\nOf the officers and men from the 38th Division cross-leveled to other units, 301 died during the Great War:  105 died in combat; 47 died from wounds; 68 from non-combat accidents or incidents; and 81 from complications arising from influenza or pneumonia.<ref>Webster (1966), p.33</ref>\n\n*Commanders: Maj.

The experiences of the war convinced the War Department and Congress to retain a reserve structure in the event of a future war.  A series of amendments to the [[National Defense Act of 1916]] codified the structure of the Army of the United States to include the National Guard when in federal service. Within the text of the final amendment of August 1921 was the provision to \"preserve the names, numbers and other designations, flags and records of the divisions...that served in the World War\".<ref>{{cite book|last=No Author|title=The National Defense Act Approved June 3, 1916 as Amended|year=1921|publisher=US Government Printing Office|location=Washington D.C.|pages=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\nAt the company level, the first units were organized by spring 1921; by November 1921 the Indiana National Guard had approximately 4,000 soldiers in an active drilling status.  Higher-level actions took longer, with the 38th Division headquarters not organized and federally recognized until March 1923, with Major General [[Robert Tyndall|Robert H. Tyndall]] as the division commander.  Tyndall well embodied the citizen-soldier concept. During the World War, Tyndall earned the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] and [[Croix de guerre 1914\u20131918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] for his successful combat leadership of the 150th Field Artillery.  In peacetime, he served as a bank vice-president and was deeply engaged in the organization of the [[American Legion]].  The majority of the divisional structure was allotted to Indiana, with the divisional headquarters established in Indianapolis.  Besides the headquarters, the 76th Infantry Brigade (with the 151st and 152nd Infantry Regiments), 139th and 150th Field Artillery Regiments, and the 113th Engineer Regiment were allotted solely to Indiana.  Kentucky organized the 75th Infantry Brigade (149th Infantry Regiment; the [[150th Infantry Regiment (United States)|150th Infantry]] was earmarked for West Virginia) and the 138th Field Artillery Regiment.  The medical, quartermaster, and division special troops elements were divided among Indiana and Kentucky.<ref>{{cite book|last=No Author|title=Pictorial History 38th Division|year=1941|publisher=Army-Navy Publishers|location=Baton Rouge LA|pages=7}}</ref>\n\n==World War II==\n*Ordered into federal service: 17 January 1941 (National Guard Division from Indiana, Kentucky, and West Virginia).\n*Overseas: 3 January 1944.\n*Campaigns: New Guinea, Southern Philippines, Luzon.\n*Distinguished Unit Citations: 1.\n*Awards: [[Medal of Honor|MH]] [[William H.

It received further training and the duty of the defense of [[Oahu]]. The division embarked from Hawaii to New Guinea, where the combat elements conducted final combat rehearsals (made realistic by the presence of bypassed Japanese troops) from July to November 1944.  Once rehearsals were complete, the 38th Infantry Division sailed for [[Leyte]], landing in December 1944. Enemy [[paratroops]] attempted to capture the Buri, Bayug, and San Pablo airstrips on 6 December. The 149th Infantry Regiment destroyed organized resistance, 11 December, and defended the strips until relieved, 4 January 1945. The division landed in the San Narciso area in Southern [[Zambales]] Province, [[Luzon]], 29 January 1945, without opposition. The [[San Marcelino]] airstrip was secured on the same day and the port facilities at [[Olongapo]] were captured on the 30th as well as [[Grande Island]] in [[Subic Bay]] after an amphibious landing. Driving west of Olongapo the 38th destroyed an intricate maze of enemy fortifications in [[Battle of Bataan (1945)|Zig-Zag Pass]]. While elements landed at [[Mariveles, Bataan|Mariveles]] on the southern tip of the peninsula, 15 February, other units pushed down the east coast road to Pilar and across the neck of land to Bagac along the route of the March of Death. The [[Bataan Peninsula]] was secured on 21 February, although mopping-up activities remained.  The 38th Infantry Division's rapid drive across the peninsula was critical to MacArthur's campaign plan by preventing a Japanese withdrawal into Bataan - thereby avoiding a costly siege operation.<ref>{{cite book|last=GHQ Staff|title=Reports of General MacArthur:  The Campaigns of MacArthur in the Pacific Volume I|year=1994|publisher=US Army Center of Military History|location=Carlisle Barracks:  PA|page=267}}</ref>\n\n2nd Battation of the 151st Infantry, along with elements from the Cannon and anti-tank companies, moved to [[Corregidor]], 24 February, to clear the remaining Japanese defenders from the Rock.<ref>No Author (1945).

By 30 June effective enemy opposition had been broken, although the division remained engaged in active combat operations until 14 August 1945 when President [[Harry S Truman|Harry S. Truman]] announced Japan's acceptance of the [[Potsdam Declaration]] and unconditional surrender.  As of 14 August 1945, the 38th Infantry Division had completed an unbroken stretch of 198 consecutive days in combat, officially killing 26,469 enemy combatants, and taking 1411 Japanese prisoners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hogue|first=Peyton|title=38th Infantry Division \"Avengers of Bataan\" Luzon Campaign|year=1947|publisher=Albert Love Enterprises|location=Atlanta GA|pages=42\u20133|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Although officially not \"engaged in major combat\" after 14 August, elements of the division continued to mop up Japanese stragglers in the Luzon area (who usually resisted to the death), until the signing of the [[Victory over Japan Day|VJ Day]] surrender documents on 2 September 1945. Even after VJ Day, the division's combat outposts continued to net prisoners until the division was officially relieved on 5 October 1945.

Instead, the division was alerted on 15 September 1945 that it was to return to the United States and demobilize.  Major General Irving and key staffers flew from Manila, while the bulk of the division elements sailed from the Philippines beginning in October.  The 38th Infantry Division was directed to Camp Anza, California, for final demobilization and deactivation, which was completed on 9 November 1945.<ref>{{cite book|last=Webster|first=Leonard E.|title=A Military History of the Indiana National Guard 1816-1966|year=September 1966|publisher=The Military Department of Indiana|location=Indianapolis, IN|pages=89\u201390}}</ref>\n\nFor a time, the 38th Infantry Division remained inactivated while debate raged within the federal government as to the size, scope and even the necessity for a separate Army National Guard.  In October 1945, the War Department issued directives to reconstitute the Army National Guard as an integral part of the Reserve Component which still retained the unique dual nature of the pre-war Guard.  First priority under the new plan was the organization and reactivation of eighteen division headquarters, one of which was the 38th Infantry Division.<ref>{{cite book|last=No Author|title=I Am the Guard:  A History of the Army National Guard 1636-2000|year=2000|publisher=National Guard Bureau|location=Crystal City, VA|pages=194\u2013197}}</ref>\n\nWithin Indiana, organizational actions were already in the works led by Indiana Adjutant General Ben H. Watt.  By March 1946, Watt submitted a proposed recruitment quota to the National Guard Bureau (NGB), and designated commanders in anticipation of receiving approval for the reorganizing units.  Receiving approval from NGB in October 1946, Indiana began organizing and reconstituting the subordinate elements of the 38th Infantry Division.  Unit strength grew quickly, swelled by large numbers of World War II veterans.  The influx of tested combat leaders facilitated the activation of the Headquarters and Special Troops unit of the 38th Infantry Division, which officially organized in Indianapolis on 6 October 1946, and received federal recognition on 5 March 1947.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Robert|title=The Longest Arm|year=1995|publisher=Unpublished Manuscript|location=Indianapolis, IN|page=12}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the pre-war 38th Division, the post-war 38th Infantry Division force structure was allotted entirely to Indiana, and consisted of a triangular structure (three infantry regiments, with three line battalions per regiment) with a total authorization of 16,241 officers, non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and soldiers.

In 1968, the division was the first reserve organization to reorganize under the Army's Reorganization Objective of the Army Division ([[History of the United States Army|ROAD]]) concept, which included three brigade headquarters tailored by the attachment of combat and support battalions. Accompanying the ROAD reorganization was the return to multi-state aspect of the pre-war division, with the division headquarters, divisional artillery, and the 76th Infantry Brigade stationed in Indiana, with the remaining two infantry brigades organized in Ohio and Michigan.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Watt|editor-first=William|title=''Indiana's Citizen Soldiers:  The Militia and National Guard in Indiana History''|year=1980|publisher=The Indiana State Armory Board|location=Indianapolis IN|pages=187\u201388}}</ref> In 1994, the division headquarters reorganized as a mechanized infantry division headquarters, a designation which it retained until 2008.<ref>{{cite book|last=No Author|title=Permanent Orders 072-001|date=22 August 1994|publisher=Military Department of Indiana|location=Indianapolis IN}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], the 38th Infantry Division formed part of the Strategic Reserve to support the Active Army in the event of a full-scale war with the [[Soviet Union]] and her satellites.  In 1965, the Division was designated part of the [[Selected Reserve Force]], higher priority [[Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces|Reserve Component]] units that received better equipment and greater funding in order to maintain higher levels of readiness.<ref>Watt (1980), pp.187\u2013188</ref>\nIn 1981, elements of the 38th Infantry Division took part in Exercise [[REFORGER]] (Return of Forces to Germany) as a way of testing the United States' ability to strategically deploy reserves into [[West Germany]] in response to a [[Warsaw Pact]] invasion.  Other elements of the 38th Infantry Division, both company sized units as well as individual Soldiers, have participated in [https://web.archive.org/web/20131227055527/http://myarmybenefits.us.army.mil/Home/News_Front/Overseas_training_connects_active_Reserve_Soldiers.html Overseas Deployment for Training] missions in Germany, the United Kingdom, Republic of Korea, Japan, and in Central America.\n\nWith the exception of Company D (Ranger), 151st Infantry, elements of the 38th Infantry Division were not activated for federal service in combat operations from 1945 until Operation Desert Storm in 1990.  However, elements of the Division were frequently called up for [[Indiana National Guard|State Active Duty]] to support civil authorities in mitigating the effects of natural disasters and civil unrest.  Two of the largest callups were for the Perfect Circle strike of 1955 and the [[Palm Sunday tornado outbreak of 1965|Palm Sunday tornado outbreak of April 1965]].<ref>Watt (1980), p.189</ref><ref>Webster (1966), pp.102\u2013103</ref>\n\nCompany D (Ranger), 151st Infantry was the sole divisional element (and one of a small number of National Guard units) mobilized for service in the Republic of Vietnam and was one of the most highly decorated units to serve in that conflict.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ramey|first=Timothy|title=History of the Indiana Rangers|url=http://www.ranger151.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=26|accessdate=26 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, over 7,000 soldiers from the 38th Infantry Division (from [[Indiana]], [[Ohio]], and [[Michigan]]) supported the '''Centennial Olympic Games''' in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], Georgia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Robert T.|title=38th Infantry Division History|year=2006|publisher=38th Infantry Division Association|location=Indianapolis|pages=14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Echo Battery (Target Acquisition) 139th Field Artillery deployed to Bosnia as part of peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia.<ref name=\"Fischer 2006 14\">{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Robert T.|title=38th Infantry Division History|year=2006|publisher=38th Infantry Division Association|location=Indianapolis, IN|page=14}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1998 the 76th Infantry Brigade (Separate) was selected to participate in a training deployment in the summer of 2000 to the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, LA.

The governor of Mississippi appealed to other states for National Guard units to assist in the response.  The rapid influx of Guard units from various states, although sorely needed, overwhelmed the Mississippi National Guard's ability to coordinate the military efforts.  Accordingly, National Guard Bureau activated the headquarters of the 38th Infantry Division on 30 August to deploy to Mississippi and assist the Mississippi Adjutant General (TAG) with command and control efforts.  Commanded by Major General (MG) Gregory Vadnais, the advanced party of the division deployed on 31 August 2005, while the main body departed Indianapolis by convoy on Saturday, 3 September 2005.  Organized as Task Force (TF) Cyclone, the Division established command post operations in Gulfport Mississippi, focused on providing local security, road clearance, and delivery of essential humanitarian assistance.  By the time TF Cyclone fully assumed mission on 4 September, roughly 7500 Guardsmen were on duty inside Mississippi.  Final strength of TF Cyclone peaked at 15,500 on 7 September, with elements of the division engaged in missions until transfer of authority back to Mississippi began on 15 September 2005.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wombwell|first=James A.|title=Army Support During the Hurricane Katrina Disaster|year=2009|publisher=United States Army Combat Studies Institute|location=Fort Leavenworth, KS|pages=123\u20135}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Enduring Freedom===\nIn 2009, the 38th Infantry Division headquarters was alerted to deploy a command and control element to Afghanistan to replace an outgoing maneuver enhancement brigade (MEB) 1-star headquarters conducting full-spectrum counterinsurgency operations ([[Counterinsurgency|COIN]]) within Bamyan, Parwan, Panjshir and Kapisa provinces.  In addition to the decisive COIN mission, the 38th Infantry Division would assume responsibility for operating the mayor cells at [https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jgUtikXjmgvzoYSVmKQ4BjWPBwzA?hl=en Bagram Airbase] and five other forward operating bases ([[Forward operating base|FOBs]]).  After a period of pre-mobilization training, the divisional element (organized as Task Force Cyclone under the command of Brigadier General [http://kentuckyguard.com/about-us/leadership/ Joseph Lonnie Culver]) deployed via Manis Airbase in [[Kyrgyzstan]] to Bagram airfield and completed Transfer of Authority (TOA) on 31 August 2009.  TF Cyclone assumed control of a diverse task force in [[Regional Command East]] of 4100 US military members, including Army signal, civil affairs (CA), psychological operations (PSYOPS), Military Police (MP), Embedded Training Teams (ETT), Agribusiness Development Teams (ADT); Air Force Facility/Base Engineering and Security.  The task force contained units from five coalition partners:  France, Mongolia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), [[New Zealand]] (the Bamiyan PRT), Singapore, and Mongolia.

This company and its parent battalion were administratively assigned to the 38th Infantry Division, but operationally assigned to the [[76th Infantry Brigade (United States)|76th Infantry Brigade]] (Separate) just prior to the mobilization and deployment of 2006\u201307. Originally known as Company A, 2nd Battalion (Mechanized), [[152nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|152nd Infantry Regiment]], the unit became an expeditionary force with members from all companies in the battalion, and was renamed Headquarters, and Headquarters Company (-), and would come to be known as \"Team Gator\". Upon arrival in Al Anbar Province, the unit was operationally assigned to the 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division's \"Ready First Combat Team\" and conducted extensive joint patrols and enemy clearing operations in both the Ramadi and Fallujah AOs during some of the most intense fighting of the 2006\u201307 campaign. One platoon would be assigned under the tactical control of USMC Regimental Combat Teams in the Fallujah AO, with the rest of the company being assigned to the Ready First Brigade in Ramadi. The company would also have a platoon from the Minnesota National Guard under its operational control.\n\nWhen the Ready First Brigade departed Ramadi, the company would be assigned to a new brigade, 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division (Raider Brigade), and it would participate in major clearing operations during the Surge of 2007.\n\nThe company had many soldiers who committed numerous acts of heroism that have not been truly known to this day.

It was incorporated in 1950 and is located at kilometre 1426 (Historic Mile 918) on the [[Alaska Highway]] in southern Yukon. Whitehorse's [[Downtown Whitehorse|downtown]] and [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]] areas occupy both shores of the [[Yukon River]], which originates in [[British Columbia]] and meets the [[Bering Sea]] in Alaska. The city was named after the [[White Horse Rapids]] for their resemblance to the mane of a white horse, near [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]], before the river was dammed.\n\nBecause of the city's location in the Whitehorse valley and relative proximity to the [[Pacific Ocean]], the climate is milder than comparable northern communities such as [[Yellowknife]].<ref name=\"Pinard 227\u2013237\">{{cite journal|last=Pinard|first=Jean-Paul|title=Wind Climate of the Whitehorse Area|journal=Arctic|date=September 2007|volume=60|issue=3|pages=227\u2013237|doi=10.14430/arctic215|url=http://www.esc.gov.yk.ca/pdf/wind_climate_of_the_whitehorse_area.pdf}}</ref> At this latitude winter days are short and summer days have up to about 19 hours of daylight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/canada/whitehorse?month=6|title=Sunrise and sunset times in Whitehorse, June 2018|website=www.timeanddate.com}}</ref><ref name=\"thecanadianencyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Whitehorse|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008565|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-03-25}}</ref> Whitehorse, as reported by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', is the city with the least air pollution in the world.<ref>''Guinness World Records 2013'', Page 036 (Hardcover edition). {{ISBN|9781904994879}}</ref>\n\nAs of the [[Canada 2016 census|2016 census]], the population was 25,085.<ref>{{cite web |title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Whitehorse, City [Census subdivision], Yukon and Yukon, Territory [Census division], Yukon |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=6001009&Geo2=CD&Code2=6001&Data=Count&SearchText=Whitehorse&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1 |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Statistics Canada-Government of Canada |date=8 February 2017}}</ref> This represents approximately 70 percent of the entire population of Yukon territory.\n\n==History==\nArcheological research south of the downtown area, at a location known as [[Canyon City, Yukon|Canyon City]], has revealed evidence of use by First Nations for several thousand years. The surrounding area had seasonal fish camps and [[Frederick Schwatka]], in 1883, observed the presence of a portage trail used to bypass [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]]. Before the Gold Rush, several different tribes passed through the area seasonally and their territories overlapped.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in August 1896, by [[Skookum Jim]], [[Tagish Charlie]], and [[George Washington Carmack]], set off a major change in the historical patterns of the region. Early prospectors used the [[Chilkoot Pass]], but by July 1897, crowds of neophyte [[stampede]]rs had arrived via steamship and were camping at \"White Horse\". By June 1898, there was a bottleneck of stampeders at Canyon City, many boats had been lost to the rapids as well as five people. [[Samuel Steele]] of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] said: \"why more casualties have not occurred is a mystery to me.\"\n\nOn their way to find gold, stampeders also found copper in the \"[[copper belt]]\" in the hills west of Whitehorse. The first copper claims were staked by Jack McIntyre on July 6, 1898, and [[The Cremation of Sam McGee|Sam McGee]] on July 16, 1899. Two tram lines were built, one {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} stretch on the east bank of the Yukon River from Canyon City to the rapids, just across from the present day downtown, the other was built on the west bank of the river. A small settlement was developing at Canyon City but the completion of the White Pass railway to Whitehorse in 1900 put a halt to it.\n[[File:Street in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, ca 1900 (HESTER 312).jpeg|thumb|left|Streetscape of Whitehorse in 1900. The community saw a population boom with the [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in 1896.]]\nThe [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] [[narrow-gauge]] railway linking [[Skagway]] to Whitehorse had begun construction in May 1898, by May 1899 construction had arrived at the south end of [[Bennett Lake]]. Construction began again at the north end of Bennett lake to Whitehorse. It was only in June\u2013July 1900 that construction finished the difficult Bennett Lake section itself, completing the entire route.\n\nBy 1901, the [[Whitehorse Star]] was already reporting on daily freight volumes. That summer there were four trains per day. Even though traders and prospectors were all calling the city Whitehorse (White Horse), there was an attempt by the railway people to change the name to Closeleigh (British Close brothers provided funding for the railway), this was refused by [[William Ogilvie (surveyor)|William Ogilvie]], the territory's Commissioner. Whitehorse was booming.\n\nOn May 23, 1905, a small fire in the barber shop of the Windsor Hotel got out of control when the fire engine ran out of water, spreading throughout the city and causing $300,000 in damage, though no lives were lost. [[Robert Service]] was working as a bank teller at the time and participated in suppressing the flame.<ref>{{cite web |title=Whitehorse Daily Star: Whitehorse swept by fire |url=https://www.whitehorsestar.com/History/whitehorse-swept-by-fire1 |website=Whitehorse Daily Star |language=en}}</ref> The White Horse Restaurant and Inn was among the buildings destroyed, after its co-founder [[Frederick Trump]], the grandfather of [[Donald Trump]], had sold his shares and left the city.<ref>Gwenda Blair (2000).

Until 1942, rail, river, and air were the only way to get to Whitehorse, but in 1942 the US military decided an interior road would be safer to transfer troops and provisions between Alaska and the US mainland and began construction of the [[Alaska Highway]]. The entire {{convert|2500|km|0|abbr=on}} project was accomplished between March and November 1942. The Canadian portion of the highway was only returned to Canadian sovereignty after the war. The [[Canol pipeline]] was also constructed to supply oil to the north with a refinery in Whitehorse.\n\nIn 1950 the city was incorporated and by 1951, the population had doubled from its 1941 numbers. On April 1, 1953, the city was designated the capital of the Yukon Territory when the seat was moved from [[Dawson City]] after the construction of the [[Klondike Highway]].<ref name=\"Traveller's Guide\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.visitwhitehorse.com/\n |title=The Whitehorse Interactive Traveller's Guide\n |accessdate=2006-07-03\n |pages=History\u2013>Facts\u2013>Whitehorse\u2013>The Name \"Whitehorse\"}}</ref> On March 21, 1957, the name was officially changed from White Horse to Whitehorse.<ref name=\"ref1\">Robert G.

to Whitehorse's unique urban development objectives and varied topography, neighbourhoods are usually separated from each other by large geographical features. In addition to the city's [[Downtown Whitehorse|downtown]] core on the [[Yukon River]]'s west bank, two subdivisions sit at the same elevation as the [[Yukon River]] ({{cvt|640|m||}}). Crossing the bridge to the east bank of the river leads to [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]], one of the city's oldest neighbourhoods. From Riverdale, the road climbing up Grey Mountain leads to Grey Mountain Cemetery and the local FM radio antenna.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBC AM transmitter gets three years' grace|url=http://whitehorsestar.com/archive/story/cbc-am-transmitter-gets-three-years-grace/|accessdate=2011-03-26|newspaper=[[Whitehorse Star]]|date=14 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Northern Lights (6879315371).jpg|thumb|left|An [[aurora]] over a residential neighbourhood of [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]].

Situated further north are Range Point, Porter Creek, and Crestview, as well as Whitehorse's newest neighbourhood, Whistle Bend, where most of the new residential growth is currently occurring.\n\nWest of downtown are Valleyview, Hillcrest (also largely constituted of old military lodgings) and the Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport; and beyond the [[Canada Games Centre]] along Hamilton Boulevard are the neighbourhoods of McIntyre (designated to replace inferior lands and homes of the Kwanlin Dun First Nation (\"The Village\") previously located where Marwell adjoins a marshy area), then Ingram, Arkell, Logan, Granger, and rapidly expanding Copper Ridge.\n\nWhitehorse also has subdivisions designated \"Country Residential\" which are subject to different municipal bylaws and are located farther out from the downtown.<ref>{{cite web|title=Animal FAQ|url=http://www.city.whitehorse.yk.ca/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={ED5E5AB3-9730-489F-8234-4AEB5333001E}|work=Bylaw Services|publisher=City of Whitehorse|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> They consist of the rural Whitehorse subdivisions of Hidden Valley and MacPherson at Whitehorse's northern limits; to the south: McCrae (also spelt MacRae), Wolf Creek, Wolf Creek North, Mary Lake, Cowley Creek, Spruce Hill, Pineridge and Fox Haven Estates.<ref>{{cite web|title=try Residential \u2013 Whitehorse|url=http://www.sewp.gov.yk.ca/region?regionId=YK.WH.CNTRYRES|work=Socio-Economic Web Portal|publisher=\u00a9 Yukon Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> Also located at the south end of the city is the newly designated Mt.

In 1973, the show was moved to the new Bonanza Room at the Whitehorse Travelodge. By 1975, its popularity had grown to such an extent that it became necessary to present two performances per night. In 1975 and again in 1977, the show embarked on cross-Canada tours, on which they performed everywhere from maximum security prisons to the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa. Twice the show travelled to Alert, the Canadian Forces Station five hundred miles from the North Pole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1976, the Company undertook to produce not only the Whitehorse show, but the entertainment in Dawson City's Palace Grand Theatre and Diamond Tooth Gertie's Gambling Casino.

The first, Station #1, located in the city centre at the corner of Second Avenue and Steele Street, and Station #2 (305 B Range Road) atop \"Two Mile Hill\" on the west side, with room for three trucks. It was built in 2010 to become a public safety building.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fire Department|url=http://www.city.whitehorse.yk.ca/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={9ED97345-C9A7-4607-893C-117F689D6B8E}|work=City Departments|publisher=City of Whitehorse|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fire Department Background|url=http://www.city.whitehorse.yk.ca/vertical/Sites/%7B77FF5155-2407-453B-BAE8-67D8813B88C6%7D/uploads/%7BB40BE8DD-EA04-469B-8198-EA4C2D83FAF3%7D.PDF|work=APPLICANT INFORMATION PACKAGE|publisher=City of Whitehorse|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> The original fire hall located along on the waterfront has been preserved as a historic building and cultural centre. The Fire Department currently operates with thirty-three full-time staff and approximately ten volunteers. Both fire stations are staffed 24/7 through a rotation of four platoons of six firefighters and one dispatcher.\n\nWHFD is equipped and trained to respond to Motor vehicle Accidents, high and low angle rescue, confined space, and static water ice rescue. Haz-mat, swift water and urban search and rescue are not under the departments current capabilities or can only be responded to at awareness levels.  All medical emergencies are responded to by Yukon Government Emergency Medical Services.  All aircraft emergencies are dealt with by the Eric Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport(ENWIA) ARFF fire department with mutual aid agreement activities from WHFD.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whitehorse.ca|title=Whitehorse, YT : Home|website=www.whitehorse.ca|access-date=2016-06-08}}</ref>  Whitehorse Fire Department is professionally represented by the [[International Association of Fire Fighters|IAFF and the BCPFFA]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iaff.org|title=Welcome to the IAFF Website|website=www.iaff.org|access-date=2016-06-08}}</ref>\n\nWhitehorse Fire Department is the largest municipal fire department in the territory and the only professional one.  Though they are 13% of the total population of firefighters in the territory, WHFD protects 82% of the population, and responds to 84% of fire calls within the Yukon.  WHFD falls under the authority of the Yukon Fire Marshals Office  (FMO) and reports directly to it.  Fire and life safety inspection throughout the City of Whitehorse are conducted by the Whitehorse Fire Department duty crews as well as designated Fire Prevention Officers under the direction of Municipal Bylaw 2000-01 \"Emergency Services Bylaw\" with authority from the current edition of the National Fire Code of Canada.\n\nWildland fire crews also operate in the summer to combat the forest fires across the territory. They will lend assistance to crews in B.C., Alberta, and the other territories as needed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Energy grid===\n[[Yukon Energy]] operates four conventional hydroelectric generating stations: Whitehorse Dam (40 MW), Aishihik Lake (37 MW), Mayo A (5 MW), and Mayo B (10 MW), which provide the bulk of generation for the Yukon Energy grid. An additional 39 MW of diesel generation is maintained for supplemental back-up.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Facilities|url=http://www.yukonenergy.ca/energy/facilities/|publisher=Yukon Energy|accessdate=2012-12-31}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Yukon Energy operates two wind turbines near Whitehorse, which are connected to the Whitehorse-Aishihik-Faro grid. The first turbine is a Bonus Energy 150&nbsp;kW MARK III installed in 1993 that is no longer functional. The second turbine, a [[Vestas]] 660&nbsp;kW V47 LT II was later installed in 2000 and operates only in the summer. These units need to be specially adapted to deal with icing and the northern environment.<ref>[http://www.yukonenergy.ca/ Yukon Energy]. Yukonenergy.ca.

During WWI beds increased to 30, 10 beds were added in 1943, then 20 beds in 1949, and an operating wing was added in 1951. In 1959 the hospital was rebuilt on the other bank of the Yukon River, across from its previous location, but decision making was still based in Ottawa (National Health and Welfare, Medical Services Branch).<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.whitehorsehospital.ca/wghabout/history/|work=About Us|publisher=Yukon Hospital Corporation|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> The downtown area has several private medical, dental, and optometry clinics.\n\nIn 1990, the Yukon Hospital Corporation (YHC) was created in order to prepare the transfer of powers regarding the hospital from the Federal Government to the Yukon Territorial Government. In April 1993 management of WGH was officially transferred to the YHC following a collaboration with the Yukon government and Council of Yukon First Nations (CYFN, then CYI). Construction of the present building lasted from 1994 through 1997. Today Whitehorse General hospital counts 49 in-patient beds, 10 day-surgery beds, an ER department, OR suites and several medical imaging technologies.\n\n===Transportation===\n====Air====\nWhitehorse is served by the [[Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport]] and has scheduled service to [[Vancouver]], [[Kelowna]], [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], [[Yellowknife]], [[Ottawa]] (via [[Yellowknife]]), [[Dawson City]], [[Mayo, Yukon|Mayo]], [[Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow]], [[Inuvik]], as well as  [[Frankfurt]], Germany during the summer months. The airport was developed as part of the Northwest Staging Route in 1941\u201342 and has two long paved runways. A wartime-era hangar served as terminal building from about 1960, and was replaced in December 1985 with a modern terminal. [[Air North]], a scheduled passenger and cargo airline operating [[Boeing 737]] jetliners and [[Hawker Siddeley 748]] turboprops, is based in Whitehorse.<ref>{{cite web |title=Air North, Yukon's Airline |url=https://www.flyairnorth.com/default.aspx |website=www.flyairnorth.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998 work was completed on a {{convert|340|m|abbr=on}} runway extension and other improvements (concrete turn button, installation of storm and sanitary mains, lighting upgrades, tower access road and blast pad).<ref>{{cite web|title=Whitehorse International Airport Runway Extension|url=http://www.yes-group.ca/index.php/Transportation/view_project/airport_runway_extension/|publisher=YES Group|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> Expansion of the terminal itself was completed in 2010.\n[[File:Alaska Highway Bridge.jpg|thumb|Bridge of the [[Alaska Highway]] crossing over the [[Teslin River]] at [[Johnsons Crossing]].]]\n\n====Roads====\nSurface access to Whitehorse is provided by a network of highways, including the international [[Alaska Highway]] connecting the Yukon with Alaska, British Columbia, and [[Alberta]] highway networks.\n\nWhitehorse has been described as \"pearls on a string\", with its residential, industrial, and service subdivisions located along the main thoroughfares that carry traffic within city limits, with large gaps of undeveloped (often hilly) land between them. The [[Alaska Highway]] is the primary roadway, with branch roads reaching additional subdivisions. One such branch road, signed as \"Highway 1A\" and following Two Mile Hill Road, 4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue, and Robert Service Way, is the main access to downtown, Riverdale, and the Marwell Industrial Area. Other branch roads (Range Road, Hamilton Boulevard, Mayo Road) access smaller residential areas and recreational facilities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe city [[Arterial roads in Whitehorse, Yukon|road]] network is adequate, although it is congested during rush hours and discussions occasionally occur as to how it might better be managed, such as designating one-way streets.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n====Public transit====\n[[File:Trolley with flags (7041438277).jpg|thumb|The [[Whitehorse Waterfront Trolley]] was a [[heritage streetcar]] service that operated from 2000 to 2018.]]\n[[Whitehorse Transit]] provides bus service on weekdays from morning until early evening and Saturdays during business hours.\n\n{{main|Whitehorse Waterfront Trolley}}\nThere was a waterfront tram, known as [[Whitehorse trolley|the \"trolley\"]], which provided transport along a short rail section along the Yukon River; it was chiefly tourist-oriented and is not integrated into the municipal transit system. It runs from the Rotary Peace Park, located on the south end of the city centre, up to the north end of the city centre at Spook Creek Station. Whitehorse presently has no active railway service. The trolley system runs on a small portion of the tracks formerly belonging to [[White Pass and Yukon Route]].\n\nThe last scheduled service to Whitehorse from White Pass Railway occurred in October 1982. The White Pass Railway started scheduled service from [[Skagway, Alaska]] to [[Carcross, Yukon|Carcross]], {{convert|72|km|abbr=on}} south of Whitehorse, in the spring of 2007, but this was disrupted by high lake water levels in August 2007. Speculation of a transcontinental rail link to Alaska includes one possible route option through Whitehorse; a report has recommended a hub at [[Carmacks, Yukon|Carmacks]], with a spur line to Whitehorse and on to the Inside Passage of Alaska.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n====Water====\nThe Yukon River is essentially navigable from Whitehorse to the [[Bering Sea]]. At {{convert|640|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, the river at Whitehorse is the [[Extreme points of Earth#Highest attainable by transportation|highest point on earth]] that can be reached by watercraft navigating from the sea. Currently, no passenger or freight services use the river at Whitehorse.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Other services===\nWater disposal is mostly done by draining in a septic tank where the sewage is not that well developed.

The city was named after the [[White Horse Rapids]] for their resemblance to the mane of a white horse, near [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]], before the river was dammed.\n\nBecause of the city's location in the Whitehorse valley and relative proximity to the [[Pacific Ocean]], the climate is milder than comparable northern communities such as [[Yellowknife]].<ref name=\"Pinard 227\u2013237\">{{cite journal|last=Pinard|first=Jean-Paul|title=Wind Climate of the Whitehorse Area|journal=Arctic|date=September 2007|volume=60|issue=3|pages=227\u2013237|doi=10.14430/arctic215|url=http://www.esc.gov.yk.ca/pdf/wind_climate_of_the_whitehorse_area.pdf}}</ref> At this latitude winter days are short and summer days have up to about 19 hours of daylight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/canada/whitehorse?month=6|title=Sunrise and sunset times in Whitehorse, June 2018|website=www.timeanddate.com}}</ref><ref name=\"thecanadianencyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Whitehorse|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008565|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-03-25}}</ref> Whitehorse, as reported by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', is the city with the least air pollution in the world.<ref>''Guinness World Records 2013'', Page 036 (Hardcover edition). {{ISBN|9781904994879}}</ref>\n\nAs of the [[Canada 2016 census|2016 census]], the population was 25,085.<ref>{{cite web |title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Whitehorse, City [Census subdivision], Yukon and Yukon, Territory [Census division], Yukon |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=6001009&Geo2=CD&Code2=6001&Data=Count&SearchText=Whitehorse&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1 |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Statistics Canada-Government of Canada |date=8 February 2017}}</ref> This represents approximately 70 percent of the entire population of Yukon territory.\n\n==History==\nArcheological research south of the downtown area, at a location known as [[Canyon City, Yukon|Canyon City]], has revealed evidence of use by First Nations for several thousand years. The surrounding area had seasonal fish camps and [[Frederick Schwatka]], in 1883, observed the presence of a portage trail used to bypass [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]]. Before the Gold Rush, several different tribes passed through the area seasonally and their territories overlapped.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in August 1896, by [[Skookum Jim]], [[Tagish Charlie]], and [[George Washington Carmack]], set off a major change in the historical patterns of the region. Early prospectors used the [[Chilkoot Pass]], but by July 1897, crowds of neophyte [[stampede]]rs had arrived via steamship and were camping at \"White Horse\". By June 1898, there was a bottleneck of stampeders at Canyon City, many boats had been lost to the rapids as well as five people. [[Samuel Steele]] of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] said: \"why more casualties have not occurred is a mystery to me.\"\n\nOn their way to find gold, stampeders also found copper in the \"[[copper belt]]\" in the hills west of Whitehorse. The first copper claims were staked by Jack McIntyre on July 6, 1898, and [[The Cremation of Sam McGee|Sam McGee]] on July 16, 1899. Two tram lines were built, one {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} stretch on the east bank of the Yukon River from Canyon City to the rapids, just across from the present day downtown, the other was built on the west bank of the river. A small settlement was developing at Canyon City but the completion of the White Pass railway to Whitehorse in 1900 put a halt to it.\n[[File:Street in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, ca 1900 (HESTER 312).jpeg|thumb|left|Streetscape of Whitehorse in 1900. The community saw a population boom with the [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in 1896.]]\nThe [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] [[narrow-gauge]] railway linking [[Skagway]] to Whitehorse had begun construction in May 1898, by May 1899 construction had arrived at the south end of [[Bennett Lake]]. Construction began again at the north end of Bennett lake to Whitehorse. It was only in June\u2013July 1900 that construction finished the difficult Bennett Lake section itself, completing the entire route.\n\nBy 1901, the [[Whitehorse Star]] was already reporting on daily freight volumes. That summer there were four trains per day. Even though traders and prospectors were all calling the city Whitehorse (White Horse), there was an attempt by the railway people to change the name to Closeleigh (British Close brothers provided funding for the railway), this was refused by [[William Ogilvie (surveyor)|William Ogilvie]], the territory's Commissioner. Whitehorse was booming.\n\nOn May 23, 1905, a small fire in the barber shop of the Windsor Hotel got out of control when the fire engine ran out of water, spreading throughout the city and causing $300,000 in damage, though no lives were lost. [[Robert Service]] was working as a bank teller at the time and participated in suppressing the flame.<ref>{{cite web |title=Whitehorse Daily Star: Whitehorse swept by fire |url=https://www.whitehorsestar.com/History/whitehorse-swept-by-fire1 |website=Whitehorse Daily Star |language=en}}</ref> The White Horse Restaurant and Inn was among the buildings destroyed, after its co-founder [[Frederick Trump]], the grandfather of [[Donald Trump]], had sold his shares and left the city.<ref>Gwenda Blair (2000).

Until 1942, rail, river, and air were the only way to get to Whitehorse, but in 1942 the US military decided an interior road would be safer to transfer troops and provisions between Alaska and the US mainland and began construction of the [[Alaska Highway]]. The entire {{convert|2500|km|0|abbr=on}} project was accomplished between March and November 1942. The Canadian portion of the highway was only returned to Canadian sovereignty after the war. The [[Canol pipeline]] was also constructed to supply oil to the north with a refinery in Whitehorse.\n\nIn 1950 the city was incorporated and by 1951, the population had doubled from its 1941 numbers. On April 1, 1953, the city was designated the capital of the Yukon Territory when the seat was moved from [[Dawson City]] after the construction of the [[Klondike Highway]].<ref name=\"Traveller's Guide\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.visitwhitehorse.com/\n |title=The Whitehorse Interactive Traveller's Guide\n |accessdate=2006-07-03\n |pages=History\u2013>Facts\u2013>Whitehorse\u2013>The Name \"Whitehorse\"}}</ref> On March 21, 1957, the name was officially changed from White Horse to Whitehorse.<ref name=\"ref1\">Robert G.

The White Pass Railway started scheduled service from [[Skagway, Alaska]] to [[Carcross, Yukon|Carcross]], {{convert|72|km|abbr=on}} south of Whitehorse, in the spring of 2007, but this was disrupted by high lake water levels in August 2007. Speculation of a transcontinental rail link to Alaska includes one possible route option through Whitehorse; a report has recommended a hub at [[Carmacks, Yukon|Carmacks]], with a spur line to Whitehorse and on to the Inside Passage of Alaska.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n====Water====\nThe Yukon River is essentially navigable from Whitehorse to the [[Bering Sea]]. At {{convert|640|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, the river at Whitehorse is the [[Extreme points of Earth#Highest attainable by transportation|highest point on earth]] that can be reached by watercraft navigating from the sea.
