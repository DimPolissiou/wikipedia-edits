Mr. Incredible's desire to help people draws the entire family into a confrontation with a vengeful fan-turned-foe and his killer robot.\n\nBird, who was Pixar's first outside director, developed the film as an extension of the 1960s comic books and [[spy film]]s from his boyhood and personal family life. He pitched the film to Pixar after the box office disappointment of his first feature, ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (1999), and carried over much of its staff to develop ''The Incredibles''. The animation team was tasked with animating an all-human cast, which required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing and realistic skin and hair. [[Michael Giacchino]] composed the film's [[orchestral]] score.\n\nThe film premiered on October 27, 2004, at the [[BFI London Film Festival]] and had its general release in the United States on November 5, 2004. It performed well at the box office, grossing $633 million worldwide during its original theatrical run. ''The Incredibles'' received widespread approval from critics and audiences, winning two [[Academy Awards]] and the [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]]. It was the first entirely animated film to win the prestigious [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]]. A sequel, ''[[Incredibles 2]]'', was released on June 15, 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nPublic opinion turns against Superheroes due to the collateral damage caused by their crime-fighting. After several lawsuits, the government initiates the Superhero Relocation Program, which forces Supers to permanently adhere to their secret identities and abandon their exploits. Fifteen years later, Bob and Helen Parr\u2014formerly known as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl\u2014and their children Violet, Dash, and baby Jack-Jack are a suburban family living in Metroville. Although he loves his family, Bob resents the mundanity of his suburban lifestyle and white-collar job. Together with his best friend Lucius Best, formerly known as Frozone, Bob occasionally relives \"the glory days\" by moonlighting as a vigilante.\n\nAfter his supervisor prevents him from stopping a mugging, Bob loses his temper and injures him, resulting in his dismissal. Returning home, Bob receives a message from a woman called Mirage, who gives him a mission to destroy a savage tripod-like robot, the Omnidroid, on the remote island of Nomanisan. Mr. Incredible battles and disables it by tricking it into ripping out its own power source.\n\nMr. Incredible finds the action and higher pay rejuvenating. He improves his relationship with his family and begins rigorous physical training while awaiting another assignment from Mirage over the next two months. Finding a tear in his super suit, he visits superhero costume designer [[Edna Mode]] to have it mended. Assuming that Helen knows what Bob is doing, Edna also makes suits for the rest of the family. Setting out for Nomanisan once again, Mr. Incredible discovers Mirage is working for Buddy Pine, a disaffected former fan whom he had rejected as his sidekick. Having adopted the alias of Syndrome, he has been perfecting the Omnidroid by hiring different superheroes to fight it, killing them in the process. Syndrome intends to send the perfected Omnidroid to Metroville, where he will secretly manipulate its controls to defeat it in public, becoming a \"hero\" himself. He will later sell his inventions so that everyone can become \"super\", rendering the difference meaningless.\n\nHelen visits Edna and learns what Bob has been up to. She activates a beacon Edna built into the suits to find Mr. Incredible, inadvertently causing him to be captured while infiltrating Syndrome's base. Elastigirl borrows a private plane to travel to Nomanisan. She finds out that Violet and Dash have stowed away, leaving Jack-Jack with a babysitter. Elastigirl's radio transmissions are picked up by Syndrome, who sends missiles to shoot her down. The plane is destroyed, but Elastigirl and the kids survive and use their powers to reach the island. Helen infiltrates the base and discovers Syndrome's plan. Discontented with Syndrome's indifference when her life was threatened, Mirage releases Mr. Incredible and informs him of his family's survival. Helen arrives and races off with Mr. Incredible to find their children. Dash and Violet are chased by Syndrome's guards, but fend them off with their powers before reuniting with their parents. Syndrome captures them all, leaving them imprisoned while he follows the rocket transporting the Omnidroid to Metroville.\n\nThe Incredibles escape to Metroville in another rocket with Mirage's help. As per its programming, the Omnidroid recognizes Syndrome as a threat and shoots off the remote control on his wrist, making him incapable of controlling it and knocking him unconscious. The Incredibles and Frozone fight the Omnidroid together. Elastigirl acquires the remote control, allowing Mr. Incredible to use one of the robot's claws to destroy its power source. Returning home, the Incredibles find Syndrome, who plans to kidnap Jack-Jack and raise him as his own sidekick out of revenge. As Syndrome flies up toward his jet, Jack-Jack's own superpowers start to manifest and he escapes Syndrome in midair. Elastigirl catches Jack-Jack, and Mr. Incredible throws his car at Syndrome's plane as he boards it. Syndrome is sucked into the jet's turbine by his own cape and the plane explodes.\n\nThree months later, the Incredibles witness the arrival of a supervillain called the Underminer. They put on their superhero masks, ready to face the new threat together as a family.<!-- We do not link teaser campaigns as per talk discussion but DO NOT REMOVE IT. -->\n\n== Voice cast ==\n[[File:Craig T Nelson signs autographs.jpg|thumb|upright=0.79|Craig T.

The Snug character that Helen talks to at the phone in the final film was intended to fly Helen to Nomanisan Island and to die, but he was removed from that position when Lasseter suggested to have Helen pilot the plane herself.<ref name=\"commentary\">''Finding Nemo'', 2004 DVD, commentary</ref>\n\n=== Animation ===\n[[File:Brad bird cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brad Bird]] wrote and directed the film.]]\nUpon Pixar's acceptance of the project, Brad Bird was asked to bring in his own team for the production. He brought up a core group of people he worked with on ''The Iron Giant''. Because of this, many 2-D artists had to make the shift to 3-D, including Bird himself. Bird found working with CG \"wonderfully malleable\" in a way that traditional animation is not, calling the camera's ability to easily switch angles in a given scene \"marvelously adaptable.\" He found working in computer animation \"difficult\" in a different way than working traditionally, finding the software \"sophisticated and not particularly friendly.\"<ref name=\"aniworld\" /> Bird wrote the script without knowing the limitations or concerns that went hand-in-hand with the medium of computer animation. As a result, this was to be the most complex film yet for Pixar.<ref name=\"dvdint1\" /> The film's characters were designed by Tony Fucile and [[Teddy Newton]], whom Bird had brought with him from Warner Bros.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\" /> Like most computer-animated films, ''The Incredibles'' had a year-long period of building the film from the inside out: modeling the exterior and understanding controls that would work the face and the body\u2014the articulation of the character\u2014before animation could even begin.<ref name=\"aniworld\" /> Bird and Fucile tried to emphasize the graphic quality of good 2-D animation to the Pixar team, who had only worked primarily in CG. Bird attempted to incorporate teaching from [[Disney's Nine Old Men]] that the crew at Pixar had \"never really emphasized.\"<ref name=\"aniworld\">{{cite web |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/reviews/brad-bird-pixar-tackle-cg-humans-true-superheroes |title=Brad Bird & Pixar Tackle CG Humans Like True Superheroes |publisher=AnimationWorld |date=November 5, 2004 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |author=Bill Desowitz}}</ref>\n\nFor the technical crew members, the film's human characters posed a difficult set of challenges.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\" /> Bird's story was filled with elements that were difficult to animate with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] back then. Humans are widely considered to be the most difficult things to execute in animation.<ref name=\"IGNint\" /> Pixar's animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion.<ref name=IGNint>{{cite news |last=Patrizio |first=Andy |title=An Interview with Brad Bird |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/10/an-interview-with-brad-bird |accessdate=July 27, 2013 |newspaper=IGN |date=March 9, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120195157/http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/10/an-interview-with-brad-bird |archivedate=January 20, 2013}}</ref> Creating an all-human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Although the technical team had some experience with hair and cloth in ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for ''The Incredibles'' had never been done by Pixar up until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on ''Monsters, Inc.'' had persuaded director [[Pete Docter]] to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; in fact, this was integral to her character.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\" /> Violet's long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair both underwater and blowing through the wind.<ref name=\"aniworld\" /> Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, thinking that a live-action film would be preferable, but Lasseter denied this.<ref name=\"infinity\" />\n\n{{Quote box\n|quote = ''The Incredibles'' was everything that computer-generated animation had trouble doing. It had human characters, it had hair, it had water, it had fire, it had a massive number of sets. The creative heads were excited about the idea of the film, but once I showed story reels of exactly what I wanted, the technical teams turned white. They took one look and thought, \u201cThis will take ten years and cost $500 million. How are we possibly going to do this?\u201d\n\nSo I said, \u201cGive us the black sheep. I want artists who are frustrated. I want the ones who have another way of doing things that nobody\u2019s listening to. Give us all the guys who are probably headed out the door.\u201d A lot of them were malcontents because they saw different ways of doing things, but there was little opportunity to try them, since the established way was working very, very well.\n\nWe gave the black sheep a chance to prove their theories, and we changed the way a number of things are done here. For less money per minute than was spent on the previous film, Finding Nemo, we did a movie that had three times the number of sets and had everything that was hard to do. All this because the heads of Pixar gave us leave to try crazy ideas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/innovation-lessons-from-pixar-an-interview-with-oscar-winning-director-brad-bird |title=Innovation lessons from Pixar: An interview with Oscar-winning director Brad Bird |last=Rao |first=Hayagreeva |last2=Sutton |first2=Robert |last3=Webb |first3=Allen P. |date=April 2008 |website=McKinsey Quarterly |publisher=McKinsey & Company |access-date=19 November 2018}}</ref>\n|source = \u2014 Brad Bird speaking to McKinsey Quarterly in 2008\n|width = 40%\n|bgcolor =\n}}\n\nNot only did ''The Incredibles'' cope with the difficulty of animating CG humans, but also many other complications.

Another team, dubbed the \"character team,\" digitally sculpted, rigged, and shaded all of the characters, and a simulation team was responsible for developing simulation technology for hair and clothing.<ref name=\"aniworld\" /> There were at least 781 visual effects shots in the film, and they were quite often visual gags, such as the window shattering when Bob angrily shuts the car door. Additionally, the effects team improved their modeling of clouds, using volumetric rendering for the first time.<ref name=\"aniworld\" />\n\nThe skin of the characters gained a new level of realism from a technology to produce known as \"[[subsurface scattering]].\"<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\">Price, p. 223</ref> The challenges did not stop with modeling humans. Bird decided that in a shot near the film's end, baby Jack-Jack would have to undergo a series of transformations, and in one of the five planned he would turn himself into a kind of goo. Technical directors, who anticipated spending two months or even longer to work out the goo effect, stealing precious hours from production that had already entered its final and most critical stages, petitioned the film's producer, John Walker, for help.<ref name=\"PixarTouch08\" /> Bird, who had himself brought Walker over from Warner Bros. to work on the project, was at first immovable, but after arguing with Walker in several invective-laced meetings over the course of two months, Bird finally conceded.<ref name=\"PixarTouch08\">Price, p. 224</ref> Bird also insisted that the storyboards define the blocking of characters' motions, lighting, and camera movements, which had previously been left to other departments rather than storyboarded.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\" />\n\nBird admitted that he \"had the knees of [the studio] trembling under the weight\" of ''The Incredibles'', but called the film a \"testament to the talent of the animators at Pixar,\" who were admiring the challenges the film provoked.<ref name=\"aniworld\" /> He recalled, \"Basically, I came into a wonderful studio, frightened a lot of people with how many presents I wanted for Christmas, and then got almost everything I asked for.\"<ref name=\"infinity\">Paik, Karen.

Wallin came from an era in which music was recorded, according to Giacchino, \"the right way\", which consists of everyone in the same room, \"playing against each other and feeding off each other's energy\".

Mr. Incredible's desire to help people draws the entire family into a confrontation with a vengeful fan-turned-foe and his killer robot.\n\nBird, who was Pixar's first outside director, developed the film as an extension of the 1960s comic books and [[spy film]]s from his boyhood and personal family life. He pitched the film to Pixar after the box office disappointment of his first feature, ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' (1999), and carried over much of its staff to develop ''The Incredibles''. The animation team was tasked with animating an all-human cast, which required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing and realistic skin and hair. [[Michael Giacchino]] composed the film's [[orchestral]] score.\n\nThe film premiered on October 27, 2004, at the [[BFI London Film Festival]] and had its general release in the United States on November 5, 2004. It performed well at the box office, grossing $633 million worldwide during its original theatrical run. ''The Incredibles'' received widespread approval from critics and audiences, winning two [[Academy Awards]] and the [[Annie Award for Best Animated Feature]]. It was the first entirely animated film to win the prestigious [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]]. A sequel, ''[[Incredibles 2]]'', was released on June 15, 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nPublic opinion turns against Superheroes due to the collateral damage caused by their crime-fighting. After several lawsuits, the government initiates the Superhero Relocation Program, which forces Supers to permanently adhere to their secret identities and abandon their exploits. Fifteen years later, Bob and Helen Parr\u2014formerly known as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl\u2014and their children Violet, Dash, and baby Jack-Jack are a suburban family living in Metroville. Although he loves his family, Bob resents the mundanity of his suburban lifestyle and white-collar job. Together with his best friend Lucius Best, formerly known as Frozone, Bob occasionally relives \"the glory days\" by moonlighting as a vigilante.\n\nAfter his supervisor prevents him from stopping a mugging, Bob loses his temper and injures him, resulting in his dismissal. Returning home, Bob receives a message from a woman called Mirage, who gives him a mission to destroy a savage tripod-like robot, the Omnidroid, on the remote island of Nomanisan. Mr. Incredible battles and disables it by tricking it into ripping out its own power source.\n\nMr. Incredible finds the action and higher pay rejuvenating. He improves his relationship with his family and begins rigorous physical training while awaiting another assignment from Mirage over the next two months. Finding a tear in his super suit, he visits superhero costume designer [[Edna Mode]] to have it mended. Assuming that Helen knows what Bob is doing, Edna also makes suits for the rest of the family. Setting out for Nomanisan once again, Mr. Incredible discovers Mirage is working for Buddy Pine, a disaffected former fan whom he had rejected as his sidekick. Having adopted the alias of Syndrome, he has been perfecting the Omnidroid by hiring different superheroes to fight it, killing them in the process. Syndrome intends to send the perfected Omnidroid to Metroville, where he will secretly manipulate its controls to defeat it in public, becoming a \"hero\" himself. He will later sell his inventions so that everyone can become \"super\", rendering the difference meaningless.\n\nHelen visits Edna and learns what Bob has been up to. She activates a beacon Edna built into the suits to find Mr. Incredible, inadvertently causing him to be captured while infiltrating Syndrome's base. Elastigirl borrows a private plane to travel to Nomanisan. She finds out that Violet and Dash have stowed away, leaving Jack-Jack with a babysitter. Elastigirl's radio transmissions are picked up by Syndrome, who sends missiles to shoot her down. The plane is destroyed, but Elastigirl and the kids survive and use their powers to reach the island. Helen infiltrates the base and discovers Syndrome's plan. Discontented with Syndrome's indifference when her life was threatened, Mirage releases Mr. Incredible and informs him of his family's survival. Helen arrives and races off with Mr. Incredible to find their children. Dash and Violet are chased by Syndrome's guards, but fend them off with their powers before reuniting with their parents. Syndrome captures them all, leaving them imprisoned while he follows the rocket transporting the Omnidroid to Metroville.\n\nThe Incredibles escape to Metroville in another rocket with Mirage's help. As per its programming, the Omnidroid recognizes Syndrome as a threat and shoots off the remote control on his wrist, making him incapable of controlling it and knocking him unconscious. The Incredibles and Frozone fight the Omnidroid together. Elastigirl acquires the remote control, allowing Mr. Incredible to use one of the robot's claws to destroy its power source. Returning home, the Incredibles find Syndrome, who plans to kidnap Jack-Jack and raise him as his own sidekick out of revenge. As Syndrome flies up toward his jet, Jack-Jack's own superpowers start to manifest and he escapes Syndrome in midair. Elastigirl catches Jack-Jack, and Mr. Incredible throws his car at Syndrome's plane as he boards it. Syndrome is sucked into the jet's turbine by his own cape and the plane explodes.\n\nThree months later, the Incredibles witness the arrival of a supervillain called the Underminer. They put on their superhero masks, ready to face the new threat together as a family.<!-- We do not link teaser campaigns as per talk discussion but DO NOT REMOVE IT. -->\n\n== Voice cast ==\n[[File:Craig T Nelson signs autographs.jpg|thumb|upright=0.79|Craig T.

He brought up a core group of people he worked with on ''The Iron Giant''. Because of this, many 2-D artists had to make the shift to 3-D, including Bird himself. Bird found working with CG \"wonderfully malleable\" in a way that traditional animation is not, calling the camera's ability to easily switch angles in a given scene \"marvelously adaptable.\" He found working in computer animation \"difficult\" in a different way than working traditionally, finding the software \"sophisticated and not particularly friendly.\"<ref name=\"aniworld\" /> Bird wrote the script without knowing the limitations or concerns that went hand-in-hand with the medium of computer animation. As a result, this was to be the most complex film yet for Pixar.<ref name=\"dvdint1\" /> The film's characters were designed by Tony Fucile and [[Teddy Newton]], whom Bird had brought with him from Warner Bros.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\" /> Like most computer-animated films, ''The Incredibles'' had a year-long period of building the film from the inside out: modeling the exterior and understanding controls that would work the face and the body\u2014the articulation of the character\u2014before animation could even begin.<ref name=\"aniworld\" /> Bird and Fucile tried to emphasize the graphic quality of good 2-D animation to the Pixar team, who had only worked primarily in CG. Bird attempted to incorporate teaching from [[Disney's Nine Old Men]] that the crew at Pixar had \"never really emphasized.\"<ref name=\"aniworld\">{{cite web |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/reviews/brad-bird-pixar-tackle-cg-humans-true-superheroes |title=Brad Bird & Pixar Tackle CG Humans Like True Superheroes |publisher=AnimationWorld |date=November 5, 2004 |accessdate=July 31, 2012 |author=Bill Desowitz}}</ref>\n\nFor the technical crew members, the film's human characters posed a difficult set of challenges.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\" /> Bird's story was filled with elements that were difficult to animate with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] back then. Humans are widely considered to be the most difficult things to execute in animation.<ref name=\"IGNint\" /> Pixar's animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion.<ref name=IGNint>{{cite news |last=Patrizio |first=Andy |title=An Interview with Brad Bird |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/10/an-interview-with-brad-bird |accessdate=July 27, 2013 |newspaper=IGN |date=March 9, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120195157/http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/10/an-interview-with-brad-bird |archivedate=January 20, 2013}}</ref> Creating an all-human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Although the technical team had some experience with hair and cloth in ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for ''The Incredibles'' had never been done by Pixar up until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on ''Monsters, Inc.'' had persuaded director [[Pete Docter]] to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; in fact, this was integral to her character.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\" /> Violet's long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair both underwater and blowing through the wind.<ref name=\"aniworld\" /> Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, thinking that a live-action film would be preferable, but Lasseter denied this.<ref name=\"infinity\" />\n\n{{Quote box\n|quote = ''The Incredibles'' was everything that computer-generated animation had trouble doing. It had human characters, it had hair, it had water, it had fire, it had a massive number of sets. The creative heads were excited about the idea of the film, but once I showed story reels of exactly what I wanted, the technical teams turned white. They took one look and thought, \u201cThis will take ten years and cost $500 million. How are we possibly going to do this?\u201d\n\nSo I said, \u201cGive us the black sheep. I want artists who are frustrated. I want the ones who have another way of doing things that nobody\u2019s listening to.

Another team, dubbed the \"character team,\" digitally sculpted, rigged, and shaded all of the characters, and a simulation team was responsible for developing simulation technology for hair and clothing.<ref name=\"aniworld\" /> There were at least 781 visual effects shots in the film, and they were quite often visual gags, such as the window shattering when Bob angrily shuts the car door. Additionally, the effects team improved their modeling of clouds, using volumetric rendering for the first time.<ref name=\"aniworld\" />\n\nThe skin of the characters gained a new level of realism from a technology to produce known as \"[[subsurface scattering]].\"<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\">Price, p. 223</ref> The challenges did not stop with modeling humans. Bird decided that in a shot near the film's end, baby Jack-Jack would have to undergo a series of transformations, and in one of the five planned he would turn himself into a kind of goo. Technical directors, who anticipated spending two months or even longer to work out the goo effect, stealing precious hours from production that had already entered its final and most critical stages, petitioned the film's producer, John Walker, for help.<ref name=\"PixarTouch08\" /> Bird, who had himself brought Walker over from Warner Bros. to work on the project, was at first immovable, but after arguing with Walker in several invective-laced meetings over the course of two months, Bird finally conceded.<ref name=\"PixarTouch08\">Price, p. 224</ref> Bird also insisted that the storyboards define the blocking of characters' motions, lighting, and camera movements, which had previously been left to other departments rather than storyboarded.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\" />\n\nBird admitted that he \"had the knees of [the studio] trembling under the weight\" of ''The Incredibles'', but called the film a \"testament to the talent of the animators at Pixar,\" who were admiring the challenges the film provoked.<ref name=\"aniworld\" /> He recalled, \"Basically, I came into a wonderful studio, frightened a lot of people with how many presents I wanted for Christmas, and then got almost everything I asked for.\"<ref name=\"infinity\">Paik, Karen.

Wallin noted that brass instruments, which are at the forefront of the film's score, sound better on analog equipment rather than digital. Wallin came from an era in which music was recorded, according to Giacchino, \"the right way\", which consists of everyone in the same room, \"playing against each other and feeding off each other's energy\". Many of Giacchino's future soundtracks followed suit with this style of mixing, which has divided [[International Film Music Critics Association|critics]] who feel that the recordings sometimes don't sound natural.

It was the first major battle fought between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] forces under Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] during the [[First Balkan War]]. The battle began when the Greek army attacked the Ottoman defensive line at the Sarantaporo pass, which connected [[Thessaly]] with central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nDespite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. The Greek victory at Sarantaporo opened the way for the capture of [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Kozani]].\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the conclusion of the [[Greek War of Independence]], the [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) ideology came to dominate Greek foreign policy. The ultimate goal of the Megali Idea was the incorporation of all areas traditionally populated by Greeks into an independent Greek state.{{sfn|Klapsis|2009|pp=127\u2013131}} The disastrous Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. Upon his appointment in December 1905, [[Georgios Theotokis]] became the first post-war Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited [[Crete|Cretan]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by re-arming and re-training the military, enacting extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchasing new weapons, and recalling the [[Military reserve force|reserve classes]] for training.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} The British mission was headed by Rear Admiral [[Lionel Grant Tufnell]], who placed an emphasis on gunnery practice and fleet maneuvers, while his assistants introduced a new fuse for the [[Whitehead torpedo]].{{sfn|Hooton|2014|p=65}} The French mission under Brigadier General [[Joseph Paul Eydoux]] focused its attention on improving discipline and training senior officers in large [[Formation (military)|formation]] operations.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|p=12}} The [[Hellenic Military Academy]] was modeled after the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]] shifting its focus from artillery and engineer training towards that of infantry and cavalry.{{sfn|Veremis|1976|p=115}}\n\nAfter being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912. This was due to fears that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman-held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans mobilized their armed forces on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October. The League declared [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Divisions]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35,000-40,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle for Elassona lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarantaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarantaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions, locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Provisional Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarantaporo was a narrow mountain pass, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia; it spanned some {{convert|7-8|km|miles|sigfig=1}}. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans had been methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarantaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by  the Prussian Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarantaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the Porta Pass, and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]] River, with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarantaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|yards|sigfig=1}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the villages of Metaxas and Rachovo. Upon reaching the Porta Pass it engaged in a bloody clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass and panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers fled, abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads belonging to local Christians lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey. However, upon realizing the imminent defeat of the Ottoman troops at Sarantaporo, the town's Muslim population massacred 117 local Christians.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=58\u201359}} By 11 October, the entirety of the Army of Thessaly had reached the banks of the Haliacmon, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} opening the way for the Greeks to advance towards the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] and assist the Serbs at [[Bitola|Monastir]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=46}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; the following day King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} Greek casualties in the battle of Sarantaporo numbered 182 killed and over 1,000 wounded,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} while the Ottomans lost approximately 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, around 22 to 25 [[field artillery]] pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts. The League had captured most of the Ottoman Empire's European territories and was rapidly approaching [[Constantinople]].

It was the first major battle fought between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] forces under Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] during the [[First Balkan War]]. The battle began when the Greek army attacked the Ottoman defensive line at the Sarantaporo pass, which connected [[Thessaly]] with central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nDespite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. The Greek victory at Sarantaporo opened the way for the capture of [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Kozani]].\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the conclusion of the [[Greek War of Independence]], the [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) ideology came to dominate Greek foreign policy. The ultimate goal of the Megali Idea was the incorporation of all areas traditionally populated by Greeks into an independent Greek state.{{sfn|Klapsis|2009|pp=127\u2013131}} The disastrous Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. Upon his appointment in December 1905, [[Georgios Theotokis]] became the first post-war Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited [[Crete|Cretan]] politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by re-arming and re-training the military, enacting extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchasing new weapons, and recalling the [[Military reserve force|reserve classes]] for training.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nThe climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} The British mission was headed by Rear Admiral [[Lionel Grant Tufnell]], who made an emphasis on gunnery practice and fleet maneuvers, while his assistants introduced a new fuse for the [[Whitehead torpedo]].{{sfn|Hooton|2014|p=65}} The French mission under Brigadier General [[Joseph Paul Eydoux]] focused its attention on improving discipline and training senior officers in large [[Formation (military)|formation]] operations.{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|p=12}} The [[Hellenic Military Academy]] was modeled after the [[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr]] shifting its focus from artillery and engineer training towards that of infantry and cavalry.{{sfn|Veremis|1976|p=115}}\n\nAfter being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912. This was due to fears that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans mobilized their armed forces on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October. The League declared [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st Infantry Division]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd Infantry Division]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd Infantry Division]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th Infantry Division]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Infantry Division]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th Infantry Division]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Division]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35,000-40,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle for Elassona lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarantaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarantaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions, locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Provisional Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarantaporo was a narrow mountain pass, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia; it spanned some {{convert|7-8|km|miles|sigfig=1}}. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans began methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarantaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by  the Prussian Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarantaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the Porta Pass, and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]], with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarantaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|yards|sigfig=1}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the villages of Metaxas and Rachovo. Upon reaching the Porta Pass it engaged in a bloody clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass, panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers fled, abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads belonging to local Christians lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey. However, upon realizing the imminent defeat of the Ottoman troops at Sarantaporo, the town's Muslim population massacred 117 local Christians.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=58\u201359}} By 11 October, the entirety of the Army of Thessaly had reached the banks of the Haliacmon, while the Greek cavalry entered Kozani unopposed,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} opening the way for the Greeks to advance towards the Greek majority city of [[Thessaloniki]] and assist the Serbs at [[Bitola|Monastir]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=46}} On 13 October, the Greek army transferred its general headquarters to Kozani; the following day King [[George I of Greece|George I]] arrived in the city, ordering the army to march towards Thessaloniki and [[Veroia]].{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=241\u2013243}} Greek casualties in the battle of Sarantaporo numbered 182 killed and over 1,000 wounded,{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} while the Ottomans lost approximately 500 killed, 1,000 wounded, around 22 to 25 [[field artillery]] pieces captured and other significant material losses.{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}}{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}\n\nBy May 1913, the numerically inferior Ottomans had suffered a series of serious defeats to the League's armies on all fronts.

Kharijites were a group of pious allies of Ali during the [[First Muslim Civil War]]. They separated from him following the [[Battle of Siffin]] when Ali agreed to settle the dispute with [[Mu'awiya]], governor of [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], through negotiations, a move labelled by the group as against [[Qur'an]]. After failed attempts to regain their loyalty and because of their rebellious and murderous activities, Ali confronted the Kharijites near their headquarters by [[Nahrawan]] canal, near modern-day [[Baghdad]]. Of the 4000 rebels, some 1200 were won over with promise of amnesty while majority of the remaining 2800 were killed in the ensuing battle.\n\nThe battle resulted in permanent break between the group and the rest of Muslims, whom Kharijites branded as apostates. Although defeated, they continued to threaten and harass cities and towns for years to come. Ali himself was assassinated by one of the Kharijites in January 661.\n\n==Background==\nThe controversial policies of the third caliph [[Uthman]] resulted in a rebellion and he was assassinated in 656. [[Ali]], the son-in-law and cousin of [[Muhammad]], was subsequently elected caliph by the Medinese people. His election was challenged by some of Muhammad's [[Sahaba|companions]] including [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubayd Allah]] and [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam]], and Muhammad's widow [[A'isha]]. [[Muawiyah I|Mu'awiya]], the governor of Syria and Uthman's relative, also denounced Ali's election and demanded retribution against Uthman's killers. Although Ali defeated the rebellion of Talha and Zubayr in the [[Battle of the Camel]] in 656, his war against Mu'awiya resulted in stalemate at [[Battle of Siffin|Siffin]] (July 657) when Mu'awiya called for peace.{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=7\u20138}} Although Ali was unwilling to halt the battle, his army refused to fight and he was forced to give in. An arbitration committee was setup with representatives from both Ali and Mu'awiya's side with a mandate to settle the dispute in the light of the [[Quran]]. As Ali marched back to [[Kufa]], his capital, schisms appeared in his army. A group of his soldiers criticized the arbitration and accused Ali of blasphemy for he had left the matter to the discretion of two men and not acted according to the Book of God. Most of them had earlier forced Ali to accept the arbitration. Now they exclaimed that right to judgement belongs to God alone. Twelve thousand of them separated from the army and settled at a place called Harura. They became known as Harurites.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nAli, after some time, visited the Harura camp and persuaded the seceders to give up their protest and return to Kufa.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=17}} According to some accounts, they returned on the condition that war against Mu'awiya be resumed after six months and Ali acknowledge his mistake, which he did in very general and ambiguous terms.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|pp=248\u2013249}} The arbitration proceedings continued however and after about a year (March 658),{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|p=1074}} when Ali refused to denounce the arbitration and sent his arbitration delegation headed by [[Abu Musa Ash'ari]] to carry out the talks, Kharijites decided to leave. In order to avoid being detected, they moved out in small groups and went to a place called Nahrawan on the east bank of Tigiris. Some five hundred of their [[Basra|Basran]] comrades were informed and they too joined them in Nahrawan.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=17}}{{sfn|Madelung|1997|pp=251\u2013252}} Following this exodus, they were called as Khawarij, those who leave.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|pp=1074\u20131075}}\n\n==Prelude==\nKharijites denounced Ali as caliph, declared him, his followers, and Syrians as infidels and elected [[Abd Allah ibn Wahb al-Rasibi]] their caliph. They declared war against such infidels licit and started practice of interrogating people about their opinion on Uthman and Ali. If anybody did not share their view, he was killed.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|pp=17\u201318}} In the meantime, arbitrators declared that Uthman had been killed unjustly by the rebels. Other than that, however, they could not agree on anything substantial and the process collapsed. Ali now denounced the arbitrators and called on his supporters for renewed war against Mu'awiya.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=163}} He invited Kharijites to join him in war against Mu'awiya as before. They refused to do so unless he would acknowledge that he had gone astray and repent. Ali consequently decided to depart for Syria without them.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=258}} With the Kharijite threat looming on the Kufan horizon, Ali's forces refused to march on Syria unless the Kharijites were either won over or neutralized.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=163}} Ali nevertheless persuaded them that war against Mu'awiya and Syrians was more important and started march to Syria.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=258}} On the way he received news of the Kharijites' murdering various people because of their beliefs. Ali sent one of his men for inquiry but he too was killed by the Kharijites. His soldiers once agains implored him to deal with Kharijites first for they feared for their families and property in Kufa. Ali then moved with his army to Nahrawan.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=259}}\n\n==Battle==\nHe asked Kharjites to surrender the murderers and accept peace. If they did so, he would leave them and depart to fight the Syrians. Kharijites responded that all of them were responsible for the murders and that they considered blood of his companions and followers licit.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=259}} After further exchange of arguments, Kharijite leaders told their followers not to engage in further discussion and instead prepare for martyrdom and to face God in paradise. Both sides then arranged in battle order and Ali announced that anyone of the Kharijites who would come to him or go back to Kufa would be safe and only murderers will be punished.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=260}} As a result, some 1200 Kharijites left; some joined Ali, some went back to Kufa, while others left the battlefield and went into mountains; Ibn Wahb was left with 2800 fighters.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=18}} Most of the Kharijites were on foot, while Ali's army consisted of archers, cavalry as well as foot soldiers. Ali sent his cavalry in front of his infantry. Infantry was divided in two rows and archers were placed in between the first row and cavalry. He ordered his army to let the Kharijites start the battle. Kharijites then attacked Ali's forces with vigor and broke through his cavalry. Archers showered them with arrows while cavalry attacked them from behind. Foot soldiers then attacked with swords and spears. Heavily outnumbered and surrounded, Kharijites were quickly slaughtered.{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|p=10}} All of their leaders including the caliph Ibn Wahb were slain. After the battle was over, 400 hundred wounded were found laying on ground and were sent back to their families in Kufa.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=18}} On Ali's side, seven to thirteen men are said to have died.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=260}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the battle, Ali ordered his army to march with him on Syria. They refused with the excuse that they were tired and needed some rest in Kufa, after which they will go with him on the new campaign. Ali agreed and moved to Nukhayla, mustering ground outside Kufa, and permitted his soldiers to rest and occasionally visit their homes. In the next few days, however, the camp was almost completely deserted and he was forced to abandon the Syrian campaign.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=262}} The slaughter of Ali's erstwhile Allies and pious Qur'an readers undermined Ali's position as caliph.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=164}} He was eventually assassinated by a Kharijite, named [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Muljam]], in January 661.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=18}}\n\nKharijites although decimated rose up once again. The battle of Nahrawan cemented their break from the community{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=18}} and majority of them abandoned city life and resorted to brigandage, robbery, raiding and pillaging settled areas and other anti-state activities throughout the first and [[Second Fitna|second]] civil wars. During the second civil war they controlled large parts of Arabia and Persia,{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=79}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=97}} but were later subdued by Umayyad governor of Iraq [[Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]].{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=76}} They were, however, not completely eliminated until the 10th century CE.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=79}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{EI2|last=Levi Della Vida|first=G.|authorlink=Giorgio Levi Della Vida|title=Kh\u0101ridjites|pages=1074\u20131077|volume=4}}\n* {{cite book |ref = harv |last = Donner |first = Fred M. |author-link = Fred Donner |title = Muhammad and the Believers, at the Origins of Islam |year = 2010 |publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] |location = Cambridge, MA |isbn = 9780674050976 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YM8RBAAAQBAJ }}\n* {{Kennedy-The Armies of the Caliphs}}\n* {{The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates |edition=Second}}\n* {{cite book |ref = harv |last = Lewis |first = Bernard |author-link = Bernard Lewis |title = Arabs in History |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FPJv_0EfVhIC |year = 2002 |publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] |location = Oxford |isbn = 9780191647161 }}\n* {{cite book |ref = harv |last = Madelung |first = Wilferd |author-link=Wilferd Madelung |title = The Succession to Muhammad: A Study of the Early Caliphate |url = https://books.google.de/books?id=2QKBUwBUWWkC |year = 1997 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |location = Cambridge, England |isbn = 0521646960 }}\n* {{EI2|last=Morony|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael G.

Ali sent his cavalry in front of his infantry. Infantry was divided in two rows and archers were placed in between the first row and cavalry. He ordered his army to let the Kharijites start the battle. Kharijites then attacked Ali's forces with vigor and broke through his cavalry. Archers showered them with arrows while cavalry attacked them from behind. Foot soldiers then attacked with swords and spears. Heavily outnumbered and surrounded, Kharijites were quickly slaughtered.{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|p=10}} All of their leaders including the caliph Ibn Wahb were slain. After the battle was over, 400 hundred wounded were found laying on ground and were sent back to their families in Kufa.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=18}} On Ali's side, seven to thirteen men are said to have died.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=260}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the battle, Ali ordered his army to march with him on Syria. They refused with the excuse that they were tired and needed some rest in Kufa, after which they will go with him on the new campaign. Ali agreed and moved to Nukhayla, mustering ground outside Kufa, and permitted his soldiers to rest and occasionally visit their homes. In the next few days, however, the camp was almost completely deserted and he was forced to abandon the Syrian campaign.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=262}} The slaughter of Ali's erstwhile Allies and pious Qur'an readers undermined Ali's position as caliph.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=164}} He was eventually assassinated by a Kharijite, named [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Muljam]], in January 661.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=18}}\n\nKharijites although decimated rose up once again. The battle of Nahrawan cemented their break from the community{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=18}} and majority of them abandoned city life and resorted to brigandage, robbery, raiding and pillaging settled areas and other anti-state activities throughout the first and [[Second Fitna|second]] civil wars. During the second civil war they controlled large parts of Arabia and Persia,{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=79}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=97}} but were later subdued by Umayyad governor of Iraq [[Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]].{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=76}} They were, however, not completely eliminated until the 10th century CE.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=79}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{EI2|last=Levi Della Vida|first=G.|authorlink=Giorgio Levi Della Vida|title=Kh\u0101ridjites|pages=1074\u20131077|volume=4}}\n* {{cite book |ref = harv |last = Donner |first = Fred M. |author-link = Fred Donner |title = Muhammad and the Believers, at the Origins of Islam |year = 2010 |publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] |location = Cambridge, MA |isbn = 9780674050976 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YM8RBAAAQBAJ }}\n* {{Kennedy-The Armies of the Caliphs}}\n* {{The Prophet and the Age of the Caliphates |edition=Second}}\n* {{cite book |ref = harv |last = Lewis |first = Bernard |author-link = Bernard Lewis |title = Arabs in History |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FPJv_0EfVhIC |year = 2002 |publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] |location = Oxford |isbn = 9780191647161 }}\n* {{cite book |ref = harv |last = Madelung |first = Wilferd |author-link=Wilferd Madelung |title = The Succession to Muhammad: A Study of the Early Caliphate |url = https://books.google.de/books?id=2QKBUwBUWWkC |year = 1997 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |location = Cambridge, England |isbn = 0521646960 }}\n* {{EI2|last=Morony|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael G.
