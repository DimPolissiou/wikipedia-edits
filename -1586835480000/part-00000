An entire [[subculture]] has developed around the subject, with [[support group]]s and a detailed [[Mythology|mythos]] explaining the reasons for abductions: The various aliens ([[Grey alien|Greys]], [[Reptilian humanoid|Reptilians]], \"[[Nordic aliens|Nordics]]\" and so on) are said to have specific roles, origins, and motivations. Abduction claimants do not always attempt to explain the phenomenon, but some take independent research interest in it themselves and explain the lack of greater awareness of alien abduction as the result of either [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] or governmental interest in [[UFO conspiracy theory|cover-up]].{{sfn|Mack|1995|p=435}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of alien abduction claims}}\n\n=== Paleo-abductions ===\nWhile the term \"alien abduction\" did not achieve widespread attention until the 1960s, modern speculation about some older stories interpreted them as possible cases.

The Hill incident was probably the prototypical abduction case and was perhaps the first in which the claimant described beings that later became widely known as the Greys and in which the beings were said to explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.\n\nThough these two cases are sometimes viewed as the earliest abductions, skeptic Peter Rogerson<ref name=\"WWW Patagonia demon co uk1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/90/revis01.html |author=Peter Rogerson |date=June 1993 |title=Fairyland's Hunters \u2013 Part One |access-date=August 10, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427053131/http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/90/revis01.html |archivedate=April 27, 2006}}</ref> notes they were only the first {{clarify|text=\"canonical\"|date=August 2015}} abduction cases, establishing a template that later abductees and researchers would refine but rarely deviate from. Additionally, Rogerson notes purported abductions were cited contemporaneously at least as early as 1954, and that \"the growth of the abduction stories is a far more tangled affair than the 'entirely unpredisposed' official history would have us believe.\" (The phrase \"entirely predisposed\" appeared in folklorist Thomas E. Allard's study of alien abduction; he argued that alien abductions as reported in the 1970s and 1980s had little precedent in folklore or fiction.)\n\n=== Later developments ===\nR. Leo Sprinkle, a [[University of Wyoming]] psychologist, became interested in the abduction phenomenon in the 1960s. Sprinkle became convinced of the phenomenon's actuality, and was perhaps the first to suggest a link between abductions and [[cattle mutilation]]. Eventually Sprinkle came to believe that he had been abducted by aliens in his youth; he was forced from his job in 1989.<ref>Bryan, 145fn</ref>\n\n[[Budd Hopkins]] had been interested in UFOs for some years. In the 1970s he became interested in abduction reports, and began using [[hypnosis]] to extract more details of dimly remembered events. Hopkins soon became a figurehead of the growing abductee subculture.<ref name=\"Schnabel\">Schnabel 1994 (missing source)</ref>\n\nThe 1980s brought a major degree of mainstream attention to the subject. Works by Hopkins, novelist [[Whitley Strieber]], historian [[David M. Jacobs]] and psychiatrist John E. Mack presented alien abduction as a plausible experience.<ref name=\"Schnabel\" /> Also of note in the 1980s was the publication of folklorist Thomas E. Bullard's comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees.\n\nWith Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack, accounts of alien abduction became a prominent aspect of [[ufology]]. There had been earlier abduction reports (the Hills being the best known), but they were believed to be few and far between, and saw rather little attention from ufology (and even less attention from mainstream professionals or academics). Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was far more common than earlier suspected; they estimate that tens of thousands (or more) North Americans had been taken by unexplained beings.<ref name=\"Schnabel\" />\n\nFurthermore, Jacobs and Hopkins argued that there was an elaborate process underway in which aliens were attempting to create human\u2013alien [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], the most advanced stage of which in the \"human hybridization program\" are known as hubrids,<ref>Jacobs (2015), p. 31. entire chapter 2 \"Abductees, Aliens, and the Program\" (pp. 15-46, especially Table 2, is helpful).</ref> though the motives for this effort were unknown. There had been anecdotal reports of [[false pregnancy|phantom pregnancy]] related to UFO encounters at least as early as the 1960s, but Budd Hopkins and especially David M. Jacobs were instrumental in popularizing the idea of widespread, systematic interbreeding efforts on the part of the alien intruders.\n\nThe descriptions of alien encounters as researched and presented by Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack were similar, with slight differences in each researcher's emphasis; the process of selective citation of abductee interviews that supported these variations was sometimes criticized \u2013 though abductees who presented their own accounts directly, such as Whitley Strieber, fared no better.\n\nThe involvement of Jacobs and Mack marked something of a [[sea change (transformation)|sea change]] in the abduction studies. Their efforts were controversial (both men saw some degree of damage to their professional reputations), but to other observers, Jacobs and Mack brought a degree of respectability to the subject.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== John E. Mack ====\nMatheson writes that \"if Jacobs's credentials were impressive,\" then those of [[Harvard]] psychiatrist [[John E. Mack]] might seem \"impeccable\" in comparison.<ref>Matheson, 251</ref> Mack was a well known, highly esteemed psychiatrist, author of over 150 scientific articles and winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his biography of [[T. E. Lawrence]]. Mack became interested in the phenomenon in the late 1980s, interviewing over 800 people, and eventually writing two books on the subject.\n\nMack devoted a substantial amount of time to investigating such cases and eventually concluded that the only phenomenon in psychiatry that adequately explained the patients' symptoms in several of the most compelling cases was [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].{{sfn|Mack|1995|p=433|ps=: \"Third, neurophysiological explanations do not account for hyperarousal and anxiety triggered by [events] linked to abduction. With the integration of the [traumatic experience] these reactions sometimes resolve, as predicted by theories of post traumatic stress disorder.\"}} As he noted at the time, this would imply that the patient genuinely believed that the remembered frightening incident had really occurred \u2013 the position Mack came to endorse.{{sfn|Mack|1995|p=434|ps=: \"I have no basis for concluding as yet that anything other than what experiencers say happened to them actually did.\"}}\n\nIn June 1992, Mack and the physicist [[David E. Pritchard]] organized a five-day conference at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to discuss and debate the abduction phenomenon.<ref name=\"www_cufos_org7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cufos.org/abduct_P1.html |title=cufos.org |accessdate=August 10, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717124137/http://www.cufos.org/abduct_P1.html |archivedate=July 17, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The conference attracted a wide range of professionals, representing a variety of perspectives.\n\nWriter [[C. D. B. Bryan]] attended the conference, initially intending to gather information for a short humorous article for [[The New Yorker]]. While attending the conference, however, Bryan's view of the subject changed, and he wrote a serious, open-minded book on the phenomenon, additionally interviewing many abductees, skeptics, and proponents.\n\nMack's study of numerous cases led him to the conclusion that while investigators should remain open to the possibility of experiences occurring, stories should not be considered to involve actual physical entities and should be treated like subjective witness reports of personal experience.  The purported beings would remain outside of physical reality and reports may be influenced by factors like expectations, memory reliability and interviewer suggestions.  He also reports similarities to other experiences like [[Out-of-body experience|OOBE]].{{sfn|Mack|1995|pp=423-424}}  According to Lance Rivers, he is convinced in the reality of the phenomenon but attributes it to interaction with a spiritual plane.  While Mack acknowledges that this leads to problematic speculation on the nature of the beings and their motivations, he concludes that materialist science is inadequate to inquire in those areas.{{sfn|Rivers|2002|pp=7-8}}\n\n== Abductees ==\n{{Main|Alien abduction claimants}}\n\nThe precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. One of the earliest studies of abductions found 1,700 claimants, while contested [[Statistical survey|surveys]] argued that 5\u20136 percent of the general population might have been abducted.<ref name=\"Appelle, 1996\" />\n\n=== Demographics ===\nIn a study investigating the motivations of the alleged abductors, [[Jenny Randles]] found that in each of the 4 cases out of 50 total where the experiencer was over 40 years of age, they were rejected by the aliens for \"what they (the experiencers) usually inferred to be a medical reason.\"<ref name=\"whyaretheydoingthis\">{{cite conference|last=Randles|first=J|authorlink=Jenny Randles|title=Why are They Doing This?|author2=Pritchard A|author3= Pritchard DE|author4= Mack JE|author5= Kasey P|author6= Yapp C|booktitle=Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference|location=Cambridge|publisher=North Cambridge Press|date=1994|pages=69\u201370|isbn=0-9644917-0-2}}</ref> Randles concludes \"[T]he abduction is essentially a young person's experience.\"<ref name=\"whyaretheydoingthis\" /> Given the reproductive focus of the alleged abductions it is not surprising that one man reported being rejected because he had undergone a vasectomy.<ref name=\"patternormirage\" /> It could also be partially because people over the age of 40 are less likely to have \"hormonic\" or reproductive activity going on.\n\nAlthough abduction and other UFO-related reports are usually made by adults, sometimes young children report similar experiences.<ref name=\"experiencesofchildren\">Truncale, Deborah Bruce. \"Alien/UFO Experiences of Children.\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia.

Some espouse conspiracy theories of sophisticated technological mind control, including the use of implants, to force them to serve an alleged [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]], or for the purposes of the [[antichrist]], considering important to warn the world of such imminent danger.{{sfn|Barkun|2003|pp=76-78, 85}}\n\n== Abduction narrative ==\n{{Main|Narrative of the abduction phenomenon}}\n\nVarious researchers have noted common points in report narratives.  According to [[Center for UFO Studies|CUFOS]]'s definition of abductee, the person must have been taken against their will by apparent non-human beings, taken to a special place perceived as extraterrestrial or to be a spaceship.  They then must experience being subjected to an examination or to engage in some form of communication with the beings (or both).  Communication may be perceived as telepathic rather than verbal.  The memory of the experience may be conscious or [[Repressed memory|\"recovered\"]] through means like hypnosis.<ref name=\"whoisanabductee\">Rodeghier, Mark. \"Who is an Abductee? A Set of Selection Criteria for Abductees.\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. p. 22.</ref>\n\nAlthough different cases vary in detail (sometimes significantly), some UFO researchers, such as folklorist Thomas E. Bullard<ref>his essay is reprinted in [[Jerome Clark|Clark]] 1998</ref> argue that there is a broad, fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical \"[[close encounter]] of the fourth kind\" (a popular but unofficial designation building on [[J. Allen Hynek]]'s classifications). Though the features outlined below are often reported, there is some disagreement as to exactly how often they actually occur.\n\nBullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events. They generally follow the sequence noted below, though not all abductions feature all the events:\n\n# '''Capture'''. The abductee is somehow rendered incapable of resisting, and taken from terrestrial surroundings to an apparent alien spacecraft.\n# '''Examination and Procedures'''. Invasive physiological and psychological procedures, and on occasion simulated behavioral situations, training & testing, or sexual liaisons.\n# '''Conference'''. The abductors communicate with the abductee or direct them to interact with specific individuals for some purpose, typically telepathically but sometimes using the abductee's native language.\n# '''Tour'''. The abductees are given a tour of their captors' vessel, though this is disputed by some researchers who consider this definition a confabulation of intent when just apparently being taken around to multiple places inside the ship.\n# '''Loss of Time'''. Abductees often rapidly forget the majority of their experience, either as a result of fear, medical intervention, or both.\n# '''Return'''. The abductees are returned to earth, occasionally in a different location from where they were allegedly taken or with new injuries or disheveled clothing.\n# '''[[Theophany]]'''. Coinciding with their immediate return, abductees may have a profound sense of love, a \"high\" similar to those induced by certain drugs, or a \"mystical experience\", accompanied by a feeling of oneness with God, the universe, or their abductors. Whether this is the result of a metaphysical change, [[Stockholm syndrome]], or prior medical tampering is often not scrutinized by the abductees at the time.\n# '''Aftermath'''. The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.\n\nWhen describing the \"abduction scenario\", David M. Jacobs says:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated. All the procedures are predetermined. There is no standing around and deciding what to do next.

Pp. 83\u201385.</ref> These feelings manifest as a [[compulsive]] desire to be at a certain place at a certain time or as expectations that something \"familiar yet unknown,\" will soon occur.<ref name=\"composite\" /> Abductees also report feeling severe, undirected [[anxiety]] at this point even though nothing unusual has actually occurred yet.<ref name=\"composite\" /> This period of foreboding can last for up to several days before the abduction actually takes place or be completely absent.<ref name=\"composite\" />\n\nEventually, the experiencer will undergo an apparent \"shift\" into an altered state of consciousness.<ref name=\"composite\" /> British abduction researchers have called this change in consciousness \"the Oz Factor.\" External sounds cease to have any significance to the experiencer and fall out of perception.<ref name=\"composite\" /> They report feeling introspective and unusually calm.<ref name=\"composite\" /> This stage marks a transition from normal activity to a state of \"[[Paralysis|limited self-willed mobility]].\"<ref name=\"composite\" /> As consciousness shifts one or more lights are alleged to appear, occasionally accompanied by a strange mist.<ref name=\"composite\" /> The source and nature of the lights differ by report; sometimes the light emanates from a source outside the house (presumably the abductors' [[UFO]]), sometimes the lights are in the bedroom with the experiencer and transform into alien figures.<ref name=\"composite\" />\n\nAs the alleged abduction proceeds, claimants say they will walk or be levitated into an alien craft, in the latter case often through solid objects such as walls, ceilings or a closed window.<ref name=\"composite\" /> Alternatively, they may experience rising through a tunnel or along a beam of light, with or without the abductors accompanying them, into the awaiting craft.<ref name=\"composite\" />\n\n=== Examination ===\nThe examination phase of the so-called \"abduction narrative\" is characterized by the performance of medical procedures and examinations by apparently [[Abduction phenomenon#Abductors|alien beings]] against or irrespective of the will of the experiencer. Such procedures often focus on [[sex]] and [[reproductive]] [[biology]]. However, the literature holds reports of a wide variety of procedures allegedly performed by the beings. The entity that appears to be in charge of the operation is often taller than the others involved, and is sometimes described as appearing to be of a different species.<ref name=\"medicaldiff\" /><ref name=\"varietyofabductionbeings\">Bullard, Thomas E. \"The Variety of Abduction Beings.\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia.

The abductors' areas of interest appear to be the [[Human cranium|cranium]], [[nervous system]], [[human skin|skin]], [[reproductive system]], and to a lesser degree, the [[joint]]s.<ref name=\"medicaldiff\" /> Systems given less attention than a human doctor would, or omitted entirely include [[cardiovascular system]], the [[respiratory system]] below the [[human pharynx|pharynx]] and the [[lymphatic system]].<ref name=\"medicaldiff\" /> The abductors also appear to ignore the upper region of the [[abdomen]] in favor of the lower one.<ref name=\"medicaldiff\" /> The abductors do not appear to wear gloves during the \"examination.\"<ref name=\"medicaldiff\" /> Other constants of terrestrial medicine like pills and tablets are missing from abduction narratives although sometimes abductees are asked to drink liquids.<ref name=\"medicaldiff\" /> Injections also seem to be rare and [[Intravenous therapy|IVs]] are almost completely absent.<ref name=\"medicaldiff\" /> Miller says he's never heard an abductee claim to have a [[tongue depressor]] used on them.<ref name=\"medicaldiff\" />\n\n=== Subsequent procedures ===\nAfter the so-called medical exam, the alleged abductees often report other procedures being performed with the entities.<ref name=\"subsequent\">Jacobs, David M. \"Subsequent Procedures.\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 64-68.</ref> Common among these post-examination procedures are what abduction researchers refer to as imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing.<ref name=\"subsequent\" />\n\n\"Imaging\" procedures consist of an abductee being made to view screens displaying images and scenes that appear to be specially chosen with the intent to provoke certain emotional responses in the abductee.<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> \"Envisioning\" is a similar procedure, with the primary difference being that the images being viewed, rather than being on a screen, actually seem to be projected into the experiencer's mind.<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> \"Staging\" procedures have the abductee playing a more active role, according to reports containing this element.<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> It shares vivid hallucination-like mental visualization with the envisioning procedures, but during staging the abductee interacts with the illusionary scenario like a role player or an actor.<ref name=\"subsequent\" />\n\n\"Testing\" marks something of a departure from the above procedures in that it lacks the emotional analysis feature.<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> During testing the experiencer is placed in front of a complicated electronic device and is instructed to operate it.<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> The experiencer is often confused, saying that they do not know how to operate it.<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> However, when they actually set about performing the task, the abductee will find that they do, in fact, know how to operate the machine.<ref name=\"subsequent\" />\n\n==== Child presentation ====\nAbductees of all ages and genders sometimes report being subjected to a \"child presentation.\"<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> As its name implies, the child presentation involves the abduction claimant being shown a \"child.\"<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> Often the children appear to be neither human, nor the same [[species]] as the abductors.<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> Instead, the child will almost always share characteristics of ''both'' [[species]].<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> These children are labeled by experiencers as [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between humans and their abductors, usually [[Grey alien|Greys]].\n\nUnlike Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs, folklorist Thomas E. Bullard could not identify a child presentation phase in the abduction narrative, even after undertaking a study of 300 abduction reports.<ref name=\"patternormirage\">Bullard, Thomas E. \"The Well-Ordered Abduction: Pattern or Mirage?\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Bullard says that the child presentation \"seems to be an innovation in the story\"<ref name=\"patternormirage\" /> and that \"no clear antecedents\" to descriptions of the child presentation phase exist before its popularization by Hopkins and Jacobs.<ref name=\"patternormirage\" />\n\n=== Less common elements ===\nBullard also studied the 300 reports of alien abduction in an attempt to observe the less prominent aspects of the claims.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\">Bullard, Thomas E. \"The Rarer Abduction Episodes.\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 72\u201374.</ref> He notes the emergence of four general categories of events that recur regularly, although not as frequently as stereotypical happenings like the medical examination. These four types of events are:<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" />\n\n# The conference\n# The tour\n# The journey\n# Theophany\n\nChronologically within abduction reports these rarer episodes tend to happen in the order listed, between the medical examination and the return.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" />\n\nAfter allegedly displaying cold callous disregard towards the abduction experiencers, sometimes the entities will change drastically in behavior once the initial medical exam is completed.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" /> They become more relaxed and hospitable towards their captive and lead him or her away from the site of the examination.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" /> The entities then hold a '''conference''' with the experiencer, wherein they discuss things relevant to the abduction phenomenon.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" /> Bullard notes five general categories of discussion that occur during the conference \"phase\" of reported abduction narratives: An interrogation session, explanatory segment, task assignment, warnings, and prophecies.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" />\n\n'''Tours''' of the abductors' craft are a rare but recurring feature of the abduction narrative.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" /> The tour seems to be given by the alleged abductors as a courtesy in response to the harshness and physical rigors of the forced medical examination.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" /> Sometimes the abductees report traveling on a \"'''journey'''\" to orbit around Earth or to what appear to be other planets.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" /> Some abductees find that the experience is terrifying, particularly if the aliens are of a more fearsome species, or if the abductee was subjected to extensive probing and medical testing.\n\n=== Return ===\nEventually the abductors will return the abductees, usually to exactly the same location and circumstances they were in before being taken.<ref name=\"thereturn\">Hopkins, Budd. \"The Abduction Experience: Return.\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 77\u201380.</ref> Usually, explicit memories of the abduction experience will not be present, and the abductee will only realize they have experienced \"missing time\" upon checking a timepiece.<ref name=\"thereturn\" />\n\nSometimes the alleged abductors appear to make mistakes when returning their captives.<ref name=\"thereturn\" /> Famed UFO researcher Budd Hopkins has joked about \"the cosmic application of [[Murphy's Law]]\" in response to this observation.<ref name=\"thereturn\" /> Hopkins has estimated that these \"errors\" accompany 4\u20135 percent of abduction reports.<ref name=\"thereturn\" /> One type of common apparent mistake made by the abductors is failing to return the experiencer to the same spot that they were taken from initially.<ref name=\"thereturn\" /> This can be as simple as a different room in the same house, or abductees can even find themselves outside and all the doors of the house are locked from the inside.<ref name=\"thereturn\" /> Another common (and amusing) error is putting the abductee's clothes (e.g. pajamas) on backwards.\n\n=== Realization event ===\nPhysician and abduction researcher John G. Miller sees significance in the reason a person would come to see themselves as being a victim of the abduction phenomenon.<ref name=\"realizationevent\">Miller, John G. \"The Realization Event -An Important Historical Feature.\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 42\u201345.</ref> He terms the insight or development leading to this shift in identity from non-abductee to abductee the \"realization event.\"<ref name=\"realizationevent\" /> The realization event is often a single, memorable experience, but Miller reports that not all abductees experience it as a distinct episode.<ref name=\"realizationevent\" /> Either way, the realization event can be thought of as the \"[[clinical horizon]]\" of the abduction experience.<ref name=\"realizationevent\" />\n\n== Trauma and recovery ==\nMost people alleging alien abductions report invasive examinations of their bodies<ref>{{cite journal|last=Barbeito|first=PF|title=\"He's Making Me Feel Things in My Body That I Don't Feel\": The Body as Battleground in Accounts of Alien Abduction| journal=Journal of American Culture|date=2005|volume=28|issue=2|pages=201\u201315|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.2005.00164.x}}</ref> and some ascribe [[psychological trauma]] to their experiences.<ref name=Nielsen>{{cite web|url=http://www.ufodigest.com/news/0107/needforhealing.html|title=Alien Abduction: The Need for Healing|last=Nielsen|first=R|date=January 23, 2007|accessdate=February 20, 2009|publisher=UFO Digest|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503094505/http://www.ufodigest.com/news/0107/needforhealing.html|archive-date=May 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> \"Post abduction syndrome\" is a term used by abductees to describe the effects of abduction, though it is not recognized by any professional treatment organizations.<ref name=Nielsen /> People who have a [[false memory]] which makes them believe that they have been abducted by aliens develop symptoms similar to [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

This usually involves two phases, an information gathering stage, in which the hypnotherapist asks about unexplained illnesses or unusual phenomena during the patients lives (caused by or distortions of the alleged abduction), followed by hypnosis and guided imagery to facilitate recall. The information gathering enhances the likelihood that the events discussed will be incorporated into later abduction \"memories\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Spanos NP|authorlink=Nicholas Spanos|title=Multiple Identities & False Memories: A Sociocognitive Perspective|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|date=1996|pages= 122\u20133|isbn=978-1-55798-340-4}}</ref> Seven steps are hypothesized to lead to the development of false memories:<ref name=Kirsch />\n# A person is predisposed to accept the idea that certain puzzling or inexplicable experiences might be telltale signs of UFO abduction.\n# The person seeks out a therapist, whom he or she views as an authority and who is, at the very least, receptive to this explanation and has some prior familiarity with UFO abduction reports.\n# Alternatively, the therapist frames the puzzling experiences in terms of an abduction narrative.\n# Alternative explanations of the experiences are not explored.\n# There is increasing commitment to the abduction explanation and increasing anxiety reduction associated with ambiguity reduction.\n# The therapist legitimates or ratifies the abductee's experience, which constitutes additional positive reinforcement.\n# The client adopts the role of the \"victim\" or abductee, which becomes integrated into the psychotherapy and the client's view of self.\n\n=== Supportive arguments ===\nHarvard psychiatrist [[John E. Mack]] counters this argument, noting \"It might be useful to restate that a large proportion of the material relating to abductions is recalled without the use of an altered state of consciousness, and that many abduction reporters appear to relive powerful experiences after only the most minimal relaxation exercise, hardly justifying the word ''hypnosis'' at all. The relaxation exercise is useful to relieve the experiencer's need to attend to the social demands and other stimuli of face-to-face conversation, and to relieve the energies involved in repressing memories and emotion.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = The UFO Abduction Phenomenon | url = http://johnemackinstitute.org/1992/06/the-ufo-abduction-phenomenon-what-does-it-mean-for-the-transformation-of-human-consciousness/ | accessdate = June 26, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n== Perspectives ==\n{{main|Perspectives on the abduction phenomenon}}\n\nThere have been a variety of explanations offered for abduction phenomena, ranging from sharply skeptical appraisals, to uncritical acceptance of all abductee claims, to the demonological, to everything in between.\n\nSome have elected not to try explaining things, instead noting similarities to other phenomena, or simply documenting the development of the alien abduction phenomenon.\n\nOthers are intrigued by the entire phenomenon, but hesitate in making any definitive conclusions. The late Harvard psychiatrist [[John E. Mack]] concluded, \"The furthest you can go at this point is to say ''there's an authentic mystery here.'' And that is, I think, as far as anyone ''ought'' to go.\" (emphasis as in original)<ref>Bryan, 269</ref> Mack was unconvinced by piecemeal counterclaims, however, and countered that skeptical explanations naturally need to \"take into account the entire range of phenomena associated with abduction experiences,\" up to and including \"missing time,\" directly contemporaneous UFO sightings, and the occurrence in small children.{{sfn|Mack|1995|p=431}}\n\nPutting aside the question of whether abduction reports are literally and objectively \"real\", literature professor Terry Matheson argues that their popularity and their intriguing appeal are easily understood. Tales of abduction \"are intrinsically absorbing; it is hard to imagine a more vivid description of human powerlessness.\" After experiencing the frisson of delightful terror one may feel from reading [[ghost story|ghost stories]] or watching [[Horror film|horror movies]], Matheson notes that people \"can return to the safe world of their homes, secure in the knowledge that the phenomenon in question cannot follow. But as the abduction myth has stated almost from the outset, there is no avoiding alien abductors.\"<ref>Matheson, 297</ref>\n\nMatheson writes that when compared to the earlier [[contactee]] reports, abduction accounts are distinguished by their \"relative sophistication and subtlety, which enabled them to enjoy an immediately more favorable reception from the public.\"\n\nSome writers<ref>{{cite book|title=Operation Trojan Horse|isbn=978-0962653469|url=http://galaksija.com/literatura/jk_oth.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420102608/http://galaksija.com/literatura/jk_oth.pdf|archivedate=April 20, 2013|last1=Keel|first1=John A.|year=1996}}.

The Hill incident was probably the prototypical abduction case and was perhaps the first in which the claimant described beings that later became widely known as the Greys and in which the beings were said to explicitly identify an extraterrestrial origin.\n\nThough these two cases are sometimes viewed as the earliest abductions, skeptic Peter Rogerson<ref name=\"WWW Patagonia demon co uk1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/90/revis01.html |author=Peter Rogerson |date=June 1993 |title=Fairyland's Hunters \u2013 Part One |access-date=August 10, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427053131/http://www.magonia.demon.co.uk/arc/90/revis01.html |archivedate=April 27, 2006}}</ref> notes they were only the first {{clarify|text=\"canonical\"|date=August 2015}} abduction cases, establishing a template that later abductees and researchers would refine but rarely deviate from. Additionally, Rogerson notes purported abductions were cited contemporaneously at least as early as 1954, and that \"the growth of the abduction stories is a far more tangled affair than the 'entirely unpredisposed' official history would have us believe.\" (The phrase \"entirely predisposed\" appeared in folklorist Thomas E. Allard's study of alien abduction; he argued that alien abductions as reported in the 1970s and 1980s had little precedent in folklore or fiction.)\n\n=== Later developments ===\nR. Leo Sprinkle, a [[University of Wyoming]] psychologist, became interested in the abduction phenomenon in the 1960s. Sprinkle became convinced of the phenomenon's actuality, and was perhaps the first to suggest a link between abductions and [[cattle mutilation]]. Eventually Sprinkle came to believe that he had been abducted by aliens in his youth; he was forced from his job in 1989.<ref>Bryan, 145fn</ref>\n\n[[Budd Hopkins]] had been interested in UFOs for some years. In the 1970s he became interested in abduction reports, and began using [[hypnosis]] to extract more details of dimly remembered events. Hopkins soon became a figurehead of the growing abductee subculture.<ref name=\"Schnabel\">Schnabel 1994 (missing source)</ref>\n\nThe 1980s brought a major degree of mainstream attention to the subject. Works by Hopkins, novelist [[Whitley Strieber]], historian [[David M. Jacobs]] and psychiatrist John E. Mack presented alien abduction as a plausible experience.<ref name=\"Schnabel\" /> Also of note in the 1980s was the publication of folklorist Thomas E. Bullard's comparative analysis of nearly 300 alleged abductees.\n\nWith Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack, accounts of alien abduction became a prominent aspect of [[ufology]]. There had been earlier abduction reports (the Hills being the best known), but they were believed to be few and far between, and saw rather little attention from ufology (and even less attention from mainstream professionals or academics). Jacobs and Hopkins argued that alien abduction was far more common than earlier suspected; they estimate that tens of thousands (or more) North Americans had been taken by unexplained beings.<ref name=\"Schnabel\" />\n\nFurthermore, Jacobs and Hopkins argued that there was an elaborate process underway in which aliens were attempting to create human\u2013alien [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], the most advanced stage of which in the \"human hybridization program\" are known as hubrids,<ref>Jacobs (2015), p. 31. entire chapter 2 \"Abductees, Aliens, and the Program\" (pp. 15-46, especially Table 2, is helpful).</ref> though the motives for this effort were unknown. There had been anecdotal reports of [[false pregnancy|phantom pregnancy]] related to UFO encounters at least as early as the 1960s, but Budd Hopkins and especially David M. Jacobs were instrumental in popularizing the idea of widespread, systematic interbreeding efforts on the part of the alien intruders.\n\nThe descriptions of alien encounters as researched and presented by Hopkins, Jacobs and Mack were similar, with slight differences in each researcher's emphasis; the process of selective citation of abductee interviews that supported these variations was sometimes criticized \u2013 though abductees who presented their own accounts directly, such as Whitley Strieber, fared no better.\n\nThe involvement of Jacobs and Mack marked something of a [[sea change (transformation)|sea change]] in the abduction studies. Their efforts were controversial (both men saw some degree of damage to their professional reputations), but to other observers, Jacobs and Mack brought a degree of respectability to the subject.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== John E. Mack ====\nMatheson writes that \"if Jacobs's credentials were impressive,\" then those of [[Harvard]] psychiatrist [[John E. Mack]] might seem \"impeccable\" in comparison.<ref>Matheson, 251</ref> Mack was a well known, highly esteemed psychiatrist, author of over 150 scientific articles and winner of the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his biography of [[T. E. Lawrence]]. Mack became interested in the phenomenon in the late 1980s, interviewing over 800 people, and eventually writing two books on the subject.\n\nMack devoted a substantial amount of time to investigating such cases and eventually concluded that the only phenomenon in psychiatry that adequately explained the patients' symptoms in several of the most compelling cases was [[posttraumatic stress disorder]].{{sfn|Mack|1995|p=433|ps=: \"Third, neurophysiological explanations do not account for hyperarousal and anxiety triggered by [events] linked to abduction. With the integration of the [traumatic experience] these reactions sometimes resolve, as predicted by theories of post traumatic stress disorder.\"}} As he noted at the time, this would imply that the patient genuinely believed that the remembered frightening incident had really occurred \u2013 the position Mack came to endorse.{{sfn|Mack|1995|p=434|ps=: \"I have no basis for concluding as yet that anything other than what experiencers say happened to them actually did.\"}}\n\nIn June 1992, Mack and the physicist [[David E. Pritchard]] organized a five-day conference at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to discuss and debate the abduction phenomenon.<ref name=\"www_cufos_org7\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cufos.org/abduct_P1.html |title=cufos.org |accessdate=August 10, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717124137/http://www.cufos.org/abduct_P1.html |archivedate=July 17, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The conference attracted a wide range of professionals, representing a variety of perspectives.\n\nWriter [[C. D. B. Bryan]] attended the conference, initially intending to gather information for a short humorous article for [[The New Yorker]]. While attending the conference, however, Bryan's view of the subject changed, and he wrote a serious, open-minded book on the phenomenon, additionally interviewing many abductees, skeptics, and proponents.\n\nMack's study of numerous cases led him to the conclusion that while investigators should remain open to the possibility of experiences occurring, stories should not be considered to involve actual physical entities and should be treated like subjective witness reports of personal experience.  The purported beings would remain outside of physical reality and reports may be influenced by factors like expectations, memory reliability and interviewer suggestions.  He also reports similarities to other experiences like [[Out-of-body experience|OOBE]].{{sfn|Mack|1995|pp=423-424}}  According to Lance Rivers, he is convinced in the reality of the phenomenon but attributes it to interaction with a spiritual plane.  While Mack acknowledges that this leads to problematic speculation on the nature of the beings and their motivations, he concludes that materialist science is inadequate to inquire in those areas.{{sfn|Rivers|2002|pp=7-8}}\n\n== Abductees ==\n{{Main|Alien abduction claimants}}\n\nThe precise number of alleged abductees is uncertain. One of the earliest studies of abductions found 1,700 claimants, while contested [[Statistical survey|surveys]] argued that 5\u20136 percent of the general population might have been abducted.<ref name=\"Appelle, 1996\" />\n\n=== Demographics ===\nIn a study investigating the motivations of the alleged abductors, [[Jenny Randles]] found that in each of the 4 cases out of 50 total where the experiencer was over 40 years of age, they were rejected by the aliens for \"what they (the experiencers) usually inferred to be a medical reason.\"<ref name=\"whyaretheydoingthis\">{{cite conference|last=Randles|first=J|authorlink=Jenny Randles|title=Why are They Doing This?|author2=Pritchard A|author3= Pritchard DE|author4= Mack JE|author5= Kasey P|author6= Yapp C|booktitle=Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference|location=Cambridge|publisher=North Cambridge Press|date=1994|pages=69\u201370|isbn=0-9644917-0-2}}</ref> Randles concludes \"[T]he abduction is essentially a young person's experience.\"<ref name=\"whyaretheydoingthis\" /> Given the reproductive focus of the alleged abductions it is not surprising that one man reported being rejected because he had undergone a vasectomy.<ref name=\"patternormirage\" /> It could also be partially because people over the age of 40 are less likely to have \"hormonic\" or reproductive activity going on.\n\nAlthough abduction and other UFO-related reports are usually made by adults, sometimes young children report similar experiences.<ref name=\"experiencesofchildren\">Truncale, Deborah Bruce. \"Alien/UFO Experiences of Children.\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia.

Some espouse conspiracy theories of sophisticated technological mind control, including the use of implants, to force them to serve an alleged [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]], or for the purposes of the [[antichrist]], considering important to warn the world of such imminent danger.{{sfn|Barkun|2003|pp=76-78, 85}}\n\n== Abduction narrative ==\n{{Main|Narrative of the abduction phenomenon}}\n\nVarious researchers have noted common points in report narratives.  According to [[Center for UFO Studies|CUFOS]]'s definition of abductee, the person must have been taken against their will by apparent non-human beings, taken to a special place perceived as extraterrestrial or to be a spaceship.  They then must experience being subjected to an examination or to engage in some form of communication with the beings (or both).  Communication may be perceived as telepathic rather than verbal.  The memory of the experience may be conscious or [[Repressed memory|\"recovered\"]] through means like hypnosis.<ref name=\"whoisanabductee\">Rodeghier, Mark. \"Who is an Abductee? A Set of Selection Criteria for Abductees.\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. p. 22.</ref>\n\nAlthough different cases vary in detail (sometimes significantly), some UFO researchers, such as folklorist Thomas E. Bullard<ref>his essay is reprinted in [[Jerome Clark|Clark]] 1998</ref> argue that there is a broad, fairly consistent sequence and description of events that make up the typical \"[[close encounter]] of the fourth kind\" (a popular but unofficial designation building on [[J. Allen Hynek]]'s classifications). Though the features outlined below are often reported, there is some disagreement as to exactly how often they actually occur.\n\nBullard argues most abduction accounts feature the following events. They generally follow the sequence noted below, though not all abductions feature all the events:\n\n# '''Capture'''. The abductee is somehow rendered incapable of resisting, and taken from terrestrial surroundings to an apparent alien spacecraft.\n# '''Examination and Procedures'''. Invasive physiological and psychological procedures, and on occasion simulated behavioral situations, training & testing, or sexual liaisons.\n# '''Conference'''. The abductors communicate with the abductee or direct them to interact with specific individuals for some purpose, typically telepathically but sometimes using the abductee's native language.\n# '''Tour'''. The abductees are given a tour of their captors' vessel, though this is disputed by some researchers who consider this definition a confabulation of intent when just apparently being taken around to multiple places inside the ship.\n# '''Loss of Time'''. Abductees often rapidly forget the majority of their experience, either as a result of fear, medical intervention, or both.\n# '''Return'''. The abductees are returned to earth, occasionally in a different location from where they were allegedly taken or with new injuries or disheveled clothing.\n# '''[[Theophany]]'''. Coinciding with their immediate return, abductees may have a profound sense of love, a \"high\" similar to those induced by certain drugs, or a \"mystical experience\", accompanied by a feeling of oneness with God, the universe, or their abductors. Whether this is the result of a metaphysical change, [[Stockholm syndrome]], or prior medical tampering is often not scrutinized by the abductees at the time.\n# '''Aftermath'''. The abductee must cope with the psychological, physical, and social effects of the experience.\n\nWhen describing the \"abduction scenario\", David M. Jacobs says:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe entire abduction event is precisely orchestrated. All the procedures are predetermined. There is no standing around and deciding what to do next. The beings are task-oriented and there is no indication whatsoever that we have been able to find of any aspect of their lives outside of performing the abduction procedures.<ref name=\"subsequent\" />\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Capture ===\nAbduction claimants report unusual feelings preceding the onset of an abduction experience.<ref name=\"composite\">Nyman, Joe. \"A Composite Encounter Model.\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia.

Such procedures often focus on [[sex]] and [[reproductive]] [[biology]]. However, the literature holds reports of a wide variety of procedures allegedly performed by the beings.

Pp. 64-68.</ref> Common among these post-examination procedures are what abduction researchers refer to as imaging, envisioning, staging, and testing.<ref name=\"subsequent\" />\n\n\"Imaging\" procedures consist of an abductee being made to view screens displaying images and scenes that appear to be specially chosen with the intent to provoke certain emotional responses in the abductee.<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> \"Envisioning\" is a similar procedure, with the primary difference being that the images being viewed, rather than being on a screen, actually seem to be projected into the experiencer's mind.<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> \"Staging\" procedures have the abductee playing a more active role, according to reports containing this element.<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> It shares vivid hallucination-like mental visualization with the envisioning procedures, but during staging the abductee interacts with the illusionary scenario like a role player or an actor.<ref name=\"subsequent\" />\n\n\"Testing\" marks something of a departure from the above procedures in that it lacks the emotional analysis feature.<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> During testing the experiencer is placed in front of a complicated electronic device and is instructed to operate it.<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> The experiencer is often confused, saying that they do not know how to operate it.<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> However, when they actually set about performing the task, the abductee will find that they do, in fact, know how to operate the machine.<ref name=\"subsequent\" />\n\n==== Child presentation ====\nAbductees of all ages and genders sometimes report being subjected to a \"child presentation.\"<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> As its name implies, the child presentation involves the abduction claimant being shown a \"child.\"<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> Often the children appear to be neither human, nor the same [[species]] as the abductors.<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> Instead, the child will almost always share characteristics of ''both'' [[species]].<ref name=\"subsequent\" /> These children are labeled by experiencers as [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between humans and their abductors, usually [[Grey alien|Greys]].\n\nUnlike Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs, folklorist Thomas E. Bullard could not identify a child presentation phase in the abduction narrative, even after undertaking a study of 300 abduction reports.<ref name=\"patternormirage\">Bullard, Thomas E. \"The Well-Ordered Abduction: Pattern or Mirage?\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Bullard says that the child presentation \"seems to be an innovation in the story\"<ref name=\"patternormirage\" /> and that \"no clear antecedents\" to descriptions of the child presentation phase exist before its popularization by Hopkins and Jacobs.<ref name=\"patternormirage\" />\n\n=== Less common elements ===\nBullard also studied the 300 reports of alien abduction in an attempt to observe the less prominent aspects of the claims.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\">Bullard, Thomas E. \"The Rarer Abduction Episodes.\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 72\u201374.</ref> He notes the emergence of four general categories of events that recur regularly, although not as frequently as stereotypical happenings like the medical examination. These four types of events are:<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" />\n\n# The conference\n# The tour\n# The journey\n# Theophany\n\nChronologically within abduction reports these rarer episodes tend to happen in the order listed, between the medical examination and the return.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" />\n\nAfter allegedly displaying cold callous disregard towards the abduction experiencers, sometimes the entities will change drastically in behavior once the initial medical exam is completed.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" /> They become more relaxed and hospitable towards their captive and lead him or her away from the site of the examination.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" /> The entities then hold a '''conference''' with the experiencer, wherein they discuss things relevant to the abduction phenomenon.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" /> Bullard notes five general categories of discussion that occur during the conference \"phase\" of reported abduction narratives: An interrogation session, explanatory segment, task assignment, warnings, and prophecies.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" />\n\n'''Tours''' of the abductors' craft are a rare but recurring feature of the abduction narrative.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" /> The tour seems to be given by the alleged abductors as a courtesy in response to the harshness and physical rigors of the forced medical examination.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" /> Sometimes the abductees report traveling on a \"'''journey'''\" to orbit around Earth or to what appear to be other planets.<ref name=\"rarerepisodes\" /> Some abductees find that the experience is terrifying, particularly if the aliens are of a more fearsome species, or if the abductee was subjected to extensive probing and medical testing.\n\n=== Return ===\nEventually the abductors will return the abductees, usually to exactly the same location and circumstances they were in before being taken.<ref name=\"thereturn\">Hopkins, Budd. \"The Abduction Experience: Return.\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 77\u201380.</ref> Usually, explicit memories of the abduction experience will not be present, and the abductee will only realize they have experienced \"missing time\" upon checking a timepiece.<ref name=\"thereturn\" />\n\nSometimes the alleged abductors appear to make mistakes when returning their captives.<ref name=\"thereturn\" /> Famed UFO researcher Budd Hopkins has joked about \"the cosmic application of [[Murphy's Law]]\" in response to this observation.<ref name=\"thereturn\" /> Hopkins has estimated that these \"errors\" accompany 4\u20135 percent of abduction reports.<ref name=\"thereturn\" /> One type of common apparent mistake made by the abductors is failing to return the experiencer to the same spot that they were taken from initially.<ref name=\"thereturn\" /> This can be as simple as a different room in the same house, or abductees can even find themselves outside and all the doors of the house are locked from the inside.<ref name=\"thereturn\" /> Another common (and amusing) error is putting the abductee's clothes (e.g. pajamas) on backwards.\n\n=== Realization event ===\nPhysician and abduction researcher John G. Miller sees significance in the reason a person would come to see themselves as being a victim of the abduction phenomenon.<ref name=\"realizationevent\">Miller, John G. \"The Realization Event -An Important Historical Feature.\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia. ''Alien Discussions: Proceedings of the Abduction Study Conference''. Cambridge: North Cambridge Press, 1994. Pp. 42\u201345.</ref> He terms the insight or development leading to this shift in identity from non-abductee to abductee the \"realization event.\"<ref name=\"realizationevent\" /> The realization event is often a single, memorable experience, but Miller reports that not all abductees experience it as a distinct episode.<ref name=\"realizationevent\" /> Either way, the realization event can be thought of as the \"[[clinical horizon]]\" of the abduction experience.<ref name=\"realizationevent\" />\n\n== Trauma and recovery ==\nMost people alleging alien abductions report invasive examinations of their bodies<ref>{{cite journal|last=Barbeito|first=PF|title=\"He's Making Me Feel Things in My Body That I Don't Feel\": The Body as Battleground in Accounts of Alien Abduction| journal=Journal of American Culture|date=2005|volume=28|issue=2|pages=201\u201315|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.2005.00164.x}}</ref> and some ascribe [[psychological trauma]] to their experiences.<ref name=Nielsen>{{cite web|url=http://www.ufodigest.com/news/0107/needforhealing.html|title=Alien Abduction: The Need for Healing|last=Nielsen|first=R|date=January 23, 2007|accessdate=February 20, 2009|publisher=UFO Digest|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503094505/http://www.ufodigest.com/news/0107/needforhealing.html|archive-date=May 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> \"Post abduction syndrome\" is a term used by abductees to describe the effects of abduction, though it is not recognized by any professional treatment organizations.<ref name=Nielsen /> People who have a [[false memory]] which makes them believe that they have been abducted by aliens develop symptoms similar to [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].

This usually involves two phases, an information gathering stage, in which the hypnotherapist asks about unexplained illnesses or unusual phenomena during the patients lives (caused by or distortions of the alleged abduction), followed by hypnosis and guided imagery to facilitate recall. The information gathering enhances the likelihood that the events discussed will be incorporated into later abduction \"memories\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Spanos NP|authorlink=Nicholas Spanos|title=Multiple Identities & False Memories: A Sociocognitive Perspective|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]]|date=1996|pages= 122\u20133|isbn=978-1-55798-340-4}}</ref> Seven steps are hypothesized to lead to the development of false memories:<ref name=Kirsch />\n# A person is predisposed to accept the idea that certain puzzling or inexplicable experiences might be telltale signs of UFO abduction.\n# The person seeks out a therapist, whom he or she views as an authority and who is, at the very least, receptive to this explanation and has some prior familiarity with UFO abduction reports.\n# Alternatively, the therapist frames the puzzling experiences in terms of an abduction narrative.\n# Alternative explanations of the experiences are not explored.\n# There is increasing commitment to the abduction explanation and increasing anxiety reduction associated with ambiguity reduction.\n# The therapist legitimates or ratifies the abductee's experience, which constitutes additional positive reinforcement.\n# The client adopts the role of the \"victim\" or abductee, which becomes integrated into the psychotherapy and the client's view of self.\n\n=== Supportive arguments ===\nHarvard psychiatrist [[John E. Mack]] counters this argument, noting \"It might be useful to restate that a large proportion of the material relating to abductions is recalled without the use of an altered state of consciousness, and that many abduction reporters appear to relive powerful experiences after only the most minimal relaxation exercise, hardly justifying the word ''hypnosis'' at all. The relaxation exercise is useful to relieve the experiencer's need to attend to the social demands and other stimuli of face-to-face conversation, and to relieve the energies involved in repressing memories and emotion.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = The UFO Abduction Phenomenon | url = http://johnemackinstitute.org/1992/06/the-ufo-abduction-phenomenon-what-does-it-mean-for-the-transformation-of-human-consciousness/ | accessdate = June 26, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n== Perspectives ==\n{{main|Perspectives on the abduction phenomenon}}\n\nThere have been a variety of explanations offered for abduction phenomena, ranging from sharply skeptical appraisals, to uncritical acceptance of all abductee claims, to the demonological, to everything in between.\n\nSome have elected not to try explaining things, instead noting similarities to other phenomena, or simply documenting the development of the alien abduction phenomenon.\n\nOthers are intrigued by the entire phenomenon, but hesitate in making any definitive conclusions. The late Harvard psychiatrist [[John E. Mack]] concluded, \"The furthest you can go at this point is to say ''there's an authentic mystery here.'' And that is, I think, as far as anyone ''ought'' to go.\" (emphasis as in original)<ref>Bryan, 269</ref> Mack was unconvinced by piecemeal counterclaims, however, and countered that skeptical explanations naturally need to \"take into account the entire range of phenomena associated with abduction experiences,\" up to and including \"missing time,\" directly contemporaneous UFO sightings, and the occurrence in small children.{{sfn|Mack|1995|p=431}}\n\nPutting aside the question of whether abduction reports are literally and objectively \"real\", literature professor Terry Matheson argues that their popularity and their intriguing appeal are easily understood. Tales of abduction \"are intrinsically absorbing; it is hard to imagine a more vivid description of human powerlessness.\" After experiencing the frisson of delightful terror one may feel from reading [[ghost story|ghost stories]] or watching [[Horror film|horror movies]], Matheson notes that people \"can return to the safe world of their homes, secure in the knowledge that the phenomenon in question cannot follow. But as the abduction myth has stated almost from the outset, there is no avoiding alien abductors.\"<ref>Matheson, 297</ref>\n\nMatheson writes that when compared to the earlier [[contactee]] reports, abduction accounts are distinguished by their \"relative sophistication and subtlety, which enabled them to enjoy an immediately more favorable reception from the public.\"\n\nSome writers<ref>{{cite book|title=Operation Trojan Horse|isbn=978-0962653469|url=http://galaksija.com/literatura/jk_oth.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420102608/http://galaksija.com/literatura/jk_oth.pdf|archivedate=April 20, 2013|last1=Keel|first1=John A.|year=1996}}.

Jenny Randles and Keith Basterfield both noted at the 1992 MIT alien abduction conference that of the five cases they knew of where an abduction researcher was present at the onset of an abduction experience, the experiencer \"didn't physically go anywhere.\"<ref name=\"panelonculture\">Hall, Dick & Randles, Jenny & Basterfield, Keith & Moura, Gilda. \"Panel on Cross Cultural Patterns in Abductions.\" In: Pritchard, Andrea & Pritchard, David E. & Mack, John E. & Kasey, Pam & Yapp, Claudia.

After a period of wandering and odd jobs, he published a volume of short stories, ''50 contre 1'' (1981), and then the novels ''Bleu comme l'enfer'' (1982) and ''Zone \u00e9rog\u00e8ne'' (1984) before gaining fame with his subsequent novels ''37\u00b02 le matin'' (1985), ''Maudit Man\u00e8ge'' (1986), ''Echine'' (1988), ''Crocodiles'' (short stories) (1989), ''Lent dehors'' (1991), ''Sotos'' (1993), and ''Assassins'' (1994).\n\nFive of his novels have been adapted into films: ''37\u00b02 le matin'' (1986; English title ''[[Betty Blue]]'') which was filmed by Jean-Jacques Beineix, ''Bleu comme l'enfer'' (1986; English title ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Bleu comme l'enfer|fr|3=Bleu comme l'enfer|lt=Blue Hell}}'') directed by Yves Boisset; ''Impardonnables'' (2011; English title [[Unforgivable (2011 film)|''Unforgivable'']]) directed by [[Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9]]; ''[[Love Is the Perfect Crime]]'' (2013; original title ''L'Amour est un crime parfait'') directed by [[Arnaud Larrieu]] and [[Jean-Marie Larrieu]]; and ''Oh...'' (as ''[[Elle (film)|Elle]]'' (2016) directed by [[Paul Verhoeven]]). He also co-wrote the screenplay of ''Ne fais pas \u00e7a'' (2004) with Luc Bondy.\n\nThe TV presenter [[Antoine De Caunes]] introduced him to Swiss singer [[Stephan Eicher]].

The plot centers on a [[Service of process|process server]] and his [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] dealer as they are forced to flee from hitmen and a corrupt police officer after witnessing them commit a murder. Producer [[Judd Apatow]], who previously worked with Rogen and Goldberg on ''[[Knocked Up]]'' and ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', assisted in developing the story.\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] released the film on August 6, 2008, and it grossed $102 million worldwide on a $26 million budget. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and Franco was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award]] for his performance.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1937, a soldier ([[Bill Hader]]) in a military facility is being observed through a two-way mirror smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and revealing in his euphoria what he hates about the army. A high-ranking officer closes the project and deems marijuana illegal.\n\nSeventy years later in 2007, Dale Denton ([[Seth Rogen]]), a [[Service of process|process server]] visits his drug dealer, Saul Silver ([[James Franco]]), to buy marijuana. Saul says he may know Dale's next customer, Ted Jones ([[Gary Cole]]). At Ted's house Dale witnesses Ted and a police officer, Carol Brazier ([[Rosie Perez]]), shoot a man dead. While fleeing, Dale leaves his [[Roach (smoking)|roach]] containing Pineapple Express, a rare strain of marijuana. Ted identifies the strain and sends his henchmen Budlofsky ([[Kevin Corrigan]]) and Matheson ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) to Red ([[Danny McBride]]), a dealer who tells them about Saul.\n\nBack at Saul's apartment, Dale learns Ted is a [[drug lord]] and could trace the roach. Dale and Saul visit Red, who reveals that Ted knows who they are and intends to kill them. Dale and Saul decide they must leave the city. They sell Pineapple Express to raise bus fare but Dale is arrested by Police Liaison Officer Bobbra ([[Cleo King]]). Dale tells Bobbra that he witnessed Brazier and Ted murder a man. Bobbra has long been suspicious of Brazier's corruption and says she will investigate; however, Saul, thinking that it is Brazier driving, hijacks the police car. Brazier hears on police radio of Dale's arrest and pursues Dale and Saul in a high-speed chase, but they escape. After Dale and Saul argue and split up, Saul is kidnapped and is held in Ted's lair beneath the same military facility from 1937. Dale enlists Red's help to rescue Saul. Red backs out at the last minute and Dale is captured. While Dale and Saul are waiting to be killed, they reconcile and plan an escape.\n\nAsian mobsters attack the barn to avenge their fellow gangster's death, the murder that Dale witnessed. Dale and Saul free themselves but are caught by Matheson. A brawl ensues. Red reappears and drives his car through the barn saving Saul, but is shot by Brazier. A mobster sets off a bomb killing Ted and setting fire to the barn. Red's car explodes and lands on Brazier, killing her. Dale carries Saul from the burning barn and Red, wounded but still alive, also escapes and reconciles with them. They talk about their adventure over breakfast at a diner before Saul's grandmother picks them up and takes them to the hospital.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Dale Denton\n* [[James Franco]] as Saul Silver\n* [[Danny McBride]] as Red\n* [[Gary Cole]] as Ted Jones\n* [[Kevin Corrigan]] as Budlofsky\n* [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] as Matheson\n* [[Rosie Perez]] as Carol Brazier\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Ken\n* [[Amber Heard]] as Angie Anderson\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Robert Anderson\n* [[Nora Dunn]] as Shannon Anderson\n* [[Joe Lo Truglio]] as Mr. Edwards\n* [[Cleo King]] as Police Liaison Officer Bobbra\n* [[Bill Hader]] as Private Miller\n* [[James Remar]] as General Bratt\n* David McDivitt as Cop with Mole\n* Bibek Adhikari as Angie's ex-boyfriend\n* [[Troy Gentile]] as Troy Jones, Ted's son \n* [[Connie Sawyer]] as Faye Belogus\n* Arthur Napiontek as Clark\n* Dana Lee as Cheung\n* [[Bobby Lee]] as Bobby\n* [[Justin Long]] as Justin\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe inspiration for making ''Pineapple Express'', according to producer Judd Apatow, was [[Brad Pitt]]'s character in ''[[True Romance]]'', a stoner named Floyd.

The plot centers on a [[Service of process|process server]] and his [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] dealer as they are forced to flee from hitmen and a corrupt police officer after witnessing them commit a murder. Producer [[Judd Apatow]], who previously worked with Rogen and Goldberg on ''[[Knocked Up]]'' and ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]'', assisted in developing the story.\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] released the film on August 6, 2008, and it grossed $102 million worldwide on a $26 million budget. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and Franco was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award]] for his performance.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1937, a soldier ([[Bill Hader]]) in a military facility is being observed through a two-way mirror smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and revealing in his euphoria what he hates about the army. A high-ranking officer closes the project and deems marijuana illegal.\n\nSeventy years later in 2007, Dale Denton ([[Seth Rogen]]), a [[Service of process|process server]] visits his drug dealer, Saul Silver ([[James Franco]]), to buy marijuana. Saul says he may know Dale's next customer, Ted Jones ([[Gary Cole]]). At Ted's house Dale witnesses Ted and a police officer, Carol Brazier ([[Rosie Perez]]), shoot a man dead. While fleeing, Dale leaves his [[Roach (smoking)|roach]] containing Pineapple Express, a rare strain of marijuana. Ted identifies the strain and sends his henchmen Budlofsky ([[Kevin Corrigan]]) and Matheson ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) to Red ([[Danny McBride]]), a dealer who tells them about Saul.\n\nBack at Saul's apartment, Dale learns Ted is a [[drug lord]] and could trace the roach. Dale and Saul visit Red, who reveals that Ted knows who they are and intends to kill them. Dale and Saul decide they must leave the city. They sell Pineapple Express to raise bus fare but Dale is arrested by Police Liaison Officer Bobbra ([[Cleo King]]). Dale tells Bobbra that he witnessed Brazier and Ted murder a man. Bobbra has long been suspicious of Brazier's corruption and says she will investigate; however, Saul, thinking that it is Brazier driving, hijacks the police car. Brazier hears on police radio of Dale's arrest and pursues Dale and Saul in a high-speed chase, but they escape. After Dale and Saul argue and split up, Saul is kidnapped and is held in Ted's lair beneath the same military facility from 1937. Dale enlists Red's help to rescue Saul. Red backs out at the last minute and Dale is captured. While Dale and Saul are waiting to be killed, they reconcile and plan an escape.\n\nAsian mobsters attack the barn to avenge their fellow gangster's death, the murder that Dale witnessed. Dale and Saul free themselves but are caught by Matheson. A brawl ensues. Red reappears and drives his car through the barn saving Saul, but is shot by Brazier. A mobster sets off a bomb killing Ted and setting fire to the barn. Red's car explodes and lands on Brazier, killing her. Dale carries Saul from the burning barn and Red, wounded but still alive, also escapes and reconciles with them. They talk about their adventure over breakfast at a diner before Saul's grandmother picks them up and takes them to the hospital.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Seth Rogen]] as Dale Denton\n* [[James Franco]] as Saul Silver\n* [[Danny McBride]] as Red\n* [[Gary Cole]] as Ted Jones\n* [[Kevin Corrigan]] as Budlofsky\n* [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] as Matheson\n* [[Rosie Perez]] as Carol Brazier\n* [[Ken Jeong]] as Ken\n* [[Amber Heard]] as Angie Anderson\n* [[Ed Begley Jr.]] as Robert Anderson\n* [[Nora Dunn]] as Shannon Anderson\n* [[Joe Lo Truglio]] as Mr. Edwards\n* [[Cleo King]] as Police Liaison Officer Bobbra\n* [[Bill Hader]] as Private Miller\n* [[James Remar]] as General Bratt\n* David McDivitt as Cop with Mole\n* Bibek Adhikari as Angie's ex-boyfriend\n* [[Troy Gentile]] as Troy Jones, Ted's son \n* [[Connie Sawyer]] as Faye Belogus\n* [[Arthur Napiontek]] as Clark\n* Dana Lee as Cheung\n* [[Bobby Lee]] as Bobby\n* [[Justin Long]] as Justin\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe inspiration for making ''Pineapple Express'', according to producer Judd Apatow, was [[Brad Pitt]]'s character in ''[[True Romance]]'', a stoner named Floyd.
