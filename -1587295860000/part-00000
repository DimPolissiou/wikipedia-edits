The season premiered on June 25, 2019 and concluded on September 25, 2019. The 40-episode season was broadcast on [[CBS]] in the United States and [[Global Television Network|Global]] in [[Canada]]. The show chronicles a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, as they compete to be the last competitor remaining to win a grand prize of [[USD|$]]500,000. Over the course of the season the HouseGuests participated in a series of competitions to win power and safety to avoid being eliminated, referred to as \"evicted\". In the finale episode, previous nine evicted HouseGuests, known as the Jury, voted on who they thought should win the game out of the last two HouseGuests remaining. The HouseGuest who received the most votes would be declared the winner. Prior to the live finale a public vote is held to determine who would win the title America's Favorite HouseGuest and a prize of $25,000. Jackson Michie was declared the winner of the season in a 6\u20133 jury vote over Holly Allen while Nicole Anthony won the public vote for America's Favorite HouseGuest. CBS confirmed on September 5, 2019 that the series was renewed for a twenty-second season.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Format ==\n{{Further|Big Brother (U.S.)#Format}}\n''Big Brother'' depicts a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, that live inside a custom-built two story house outfitted with 94 HD cameras and over 113 microphones recording their every move 24 hours a day. The HouseGuests are sequestered in the ''Big Brother House'' with no contact with the outside world. During their stay the HouseGuests share their thoughts on events and other houseguests inside a private room referred to as the Diary Room.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nickiswift.com/108051/untold-truth-big-brother/ |title=The untold truth of Big Brother |last=Bianco |first=Julia |website=NickiSwift.com |language=en-US |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref> Each week, the HouseGuests compete in several competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house. At the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household (abbreviated as \"HoH\") competition. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. Then six HouseGuests are selected to compete in the Power of Veto (abbreviated as \"PoV\") competition: the reigning HoH and the nominees are guaranteed to play with the remaining slots being given to other HouseGuests selected by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is. If the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. \n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests must vote to evict one of the nominees. The Head of Household and the nominees are not allowed to vote.  This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. In the event of a tie the Head of Household will cast the tie-breaking vote in front of all the HouseGuests in the living room. The nominee with the most votes is evicted from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests, referred to as the Jury, are sequestered in a separate house following their eviction and ultimately decide the winner of the season. The Jury are not allowed  to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests. They are not shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations. The viewing public is able to award an additional prize of $25,000 to their favorite HouseGuest of the season. All evicted HouseGuests are eligible to win this award except for those who either voluntary leave or forcibly removed for rule-breaking.\n\n== HouseGuests ==\n{{main|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n[[File:Big_Brother_21_Cast_Photo.jpg|thumb|500px|right|<center>'''The cast of the twenty-first season of ''Big Brother'''''</center><hr />'''Top:''' Jackson, Jessica, Cliff, Sam, and Nick<hr />'''Middle:''' Holly, Kemi, Ovi, Isabella, Nicole, Kathryn, Christie, and Tommy<hr />'''Bottom:'''Jack, Analyse, and David]]\n\nOn June 10, 2019, CBS reported that the cast would be revealed on June 17, 2019 on ''Big Brother'' live feeds to viewers with a [[CBS All Access]] subscription.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/official-heres-season-21-cast-220000959.html|title=It's Official: Here's When the Season 21 Cast of Big Brother Will Be Revealed|last=Jean-Philippe|first=McKenzie|date=June 10, 2019|accessdate=June 10, 2019|work=[[Yahoo!

He was tasked with \"banishing\" four HouseGuests, who would compete to stay in the house. Michie chose to banish Cliff, David, Jessica and Kemi. David lost the competition. As he was immune, Michie was ineligible to compete in the first Head of Household Competition.\n* {{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#87CEFA|border=darkgray}} On Day 15, ''Camp Comeback'' was introduced. David returned to the house from sequester and the next three evicted HouseGuests (Ovi, Kemi and Cliff) remained in the house after getting voted out of the game.

America voted for Nick to be ''America's Prankster'' and took half of Holly's Head of Household power by anonymously nominating one HouseGuest at the Nomination Ceremony (denoted in '''bold''') and naming a replacement nominee if the Power of Veto is used on his nominee. Nick was not given immunity with his power and could be nominated by Holly.\n* {{note|5|Note 5}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following Jessica's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n* {{note|6|Note 6}}: During the finale, the Jury members voted for which finalist should win Big Brother.\n</small>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Big Brother 21'' was criticized negatively by critics and fans due to the HouseGuests' discriminatory tendencies.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dehnart |first1=Andy |title=Big Brother 21 racism and awfulness: an update |url=https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2019/07/big-brother-21-racism-update-bb21/ |website=realityblurred.com |publisher=Reality Blurred |accessdate=25 October 2019 |date=25 July 2019}}</ref> Professor of African American studies and the UCLA Dean of Social Sciences, Darnell Hunt, stated, \"Race is the central axis of social relationships.

The season premiered on June 25, 2019 and concluded on September 25, 2019. The 40-episode season was broadcast on [[CBS]] in the United States and [[Global Television Network|Global]] in [[Canada]]. The show chronicles a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, as they compete to be the last competitor remaining to win a grand prize of [[USD|$]]500,000. Over the course of the season the HouseGuests participated in a series of competitions to win power and safety to avoid being eliminated, referred to as \"evicted\". In the finale episode, previous nine evicted HouseGuests, known as the Jury, voted on who they thought should win the game out of the last two HouseGuests remaining. The HouseGuest who received the most votes would be declared the winner. Prior to the live finale a public vote is held to determine who would win the title America's Favorite HouseGuest and a prize of $25,000. Jackson Michie was declared the winner of the season in a 6\u20133 jury vote over Holly Allen while Nicole Anthony won the public vote for America's Favorite HouseGuest. CBS confirmed on September 5, 2019 that the series was renewed for a twenty-second season.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Format ==\n{{Further|Big Brother (U.S.)#Format}}\n''Big Brother'' depicts a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, that live inside a custom-built two story house outfitted with 94 HD cameras and over 113 microphones recording their every move 24 hours a day. The HouseGuests are sequestered in the ''Big Brother House'' with no contact with the outside world. During their stay the HouseGuests share their thoughts on events and other houseguests inside a private room referred to as the Diary Room.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nickiswift.com/108051/untold-truth-big-brother/ |title=The untold truth of Big Brother |last=Bianco |first=Julia |website=NickiSwift.com |language=en-US |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref> Each week, the HouseGuests compete in several competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house. At the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household (abbreviated as \"HoH\") competition. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. Then six HouseGuests are selected to compete in the Power of Veto (abbreviated as \"PoV\") competition: the reigning HoH and the nominees are guaranteed to play with the remaining slots being given to other HouseGuests selected by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is. If the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. \n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests must vote to evict one of the nominees. The Head of Household and the nominees are not allowed to vote.  This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. In the event of a tie the Head of Household will cast the tie-breaking vote in front of all the HouseGuests in the living room. The nominee with the most votes is evicted from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests, referred to as the Jury, are sequestered in a separate house following their eviction and ultimately decide the winner of the season. The Jury are not allowed  to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests. They are not shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations. The viewing public is able to award an additional prize of $25,000 to their favorite HouseGuest of the season. All evicted HouseGuests are eligible to win this award except for those who either voluntary leave or forcibly removed for rule-breaking.\n\n== HouseGuests ==\n{{main|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n[[File:Big_Brother_21_Cast_Photo.jpg|thumb|500px|right|<center>'''The cast of the twenty-first season of ''Big Brother'''''</center><hr />'''Top:''' Jackson, Jessica, Cliff, Sam, and Nick<hr />'''Middle:''' Holly, Kemi, Ovi, Isabella, Nicole, Kathryn, Christie, and Tommy<hr />'''Bottom:'''Jack, Analyse, and David]]\n\nOn June 10, 2019, CBS reported that the cast would be revealed on June 17, 2019 on ''Big Brother'' live feeds to viewers with a [[CBS All Access]] subscription.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/official-heres-season-21-cast-220000959.html|title=It's Official: Here's When the Season 21 Cast of Big Brother Will Be Revealed|last=Jean-Philippe|first=McKenzie|date=June 10, 2019|accessdate=June 10, 2019|work=[[Yahoo!

The HouseGuest to get the most questions correct won the final part. Michie won with 8 points, automatically nominating Holly alongside Nicole.\nOn Day 99, by Michie's sole vote, Nicole was evicted and became the ninth and final jury member. The jury, then joined by Nicole, questioned Michie and Holly as to why they should win.

He murdered six people and wounded nineteen others before being stopped by N.Y. State Court Officers. Ferguson's trial was notable for a number of unusual developments, including his firing his defense counsel and insisting on [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|representing himself]] and questioning his own victims on the stand.\n\nOn February 17, 1995, Ferguson was convicted of the six murders. He was also convicted of [[attempted murder]] for wounding nineteen passengers. {{As of|2019}}, he is serving his sentence of 315 years and eight months to life at the [[Upstate Correctional Facility]] in [[Franklin County, New York]].<ref name=\"nysdoccslookup.doccs.ny.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://nysdoccslookup.doccs.ny.gov/GCA00P00/WIQ3/WINQ130| title=Inmate Information Colin Ferguson (ID #95A1838)|publisher=New York State Department of Corrections|accessdate=July 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Shooting==\nOn December 7, 1993, Colin Ferguson purchased a ticket for the 5:33&nbsp;p.m. eastbound train<!--are the tickets really that specific?--> at the [[Atlantic Terminal|Flatbush Avenue station]] in [[Brooklyn]] which stopped at the [[Jamaica (LIRR station)|Jamaica station]] in [[Queens]].

During the next three minutes, he killed six people and injured another nineteen. Some passengers mistook the gunshots for caps or fireworks until a woman shouted, \"He's got a gun! He's shooting people!\"<ref name=\"Clines1209\" /> Ferguson walked east (forward) on the train, pulling the trigger steadily about every half second. Several passengers tried to hide beneath their seats, while others fled to the eastern end of the train and tried to enter the next car. Ferguson walked down the aisle of the train and shot people to his right and left as he passed each seat, briefly facing each victim before firing. ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the motions were \"as methodical as if he were taking tickets.\"<ref name=\"Clines1209\" /> Ferguson said, \"I'm going to get you,\" over and over as he walked down the aisle.<ref name=\"Schemo1209\" />\n\nOther passengers farther away in the train did not realize that a shooting had occurred until after the train stopped, as a crowd of panicked passengers fled from the third car into neighboring cars. One man appeared annoyed by their unruliness and said, \"Be calm,\" before they forced a train door open and fled into the station.<ref name=\"Clines1209\" /> Two people were injured in the stampede of passengers. The train's [[conductor (rail)|conductor]] was informed of the shooting, but he decided against opening the train doors right away because two of the cars were not yet at the platform. An announcement was made ordering conductors not to open the doors, but engineer Thomas Silhan climbed out the window of his cab and opened each door from the outside so that panicked passengers could escape.<ref name=\"Barron1209\" />\n\nFerguson had emptied two 15-round [[Magazine (firearms)|magazines]] during the shooting.

While he was pinned, Ferguson said, \"Oh God, what did I do? What did I do? I deserve whatever I get.\"<ref name=\"Clines1209\" /> He also repeatedly pleaded with those holding him: \"Don't shoot me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\" Five to six people continued to hold him pinned for some time while they awaited relief.

Belfi, the Nassau County Judge assigned to the Ferguson case, criticized Kunstler for speaking to the media about the proposed defense before it had been examined by a mental health professional. Belfi said \"Mr. Kunstler may have many talents, but until he receives his medical degree with a specialty in psychiatry, these types of conclusions should best be left for medical experts and the triers of the facts.\"<ref name=\"Hoffman0423\" />\n\nBlack rage was first proposed by psychologists William Henry Grier and Price Cobbs in their 1968 book, ''[[Black Rage (book)|Black Rage]]'' ({{ISBN|1-57910-349-9}}). Grier and Cobbs argue that black people living in a racist, white supremacist society are psychologically damaged by the effects of racist oppression. They argue that this damage causes black people to act abnormally in certain situations.\n\nFerguson started to claim he was not involved in the Long Island Rail Road shootings at all, and repeatedly refused to meet with a psychiatrist chosen by Kunstler and Kuby. Ferguson told the attorneys he was receiving messages straight from God, and spoke of conspiracies to destroy him by those opposed to God.<ref name=\"Marks0812\" /> On August 12, 1994, Kunstler and Kuby asked Judge Belfi to reconsider Ferguson's competence to stand trial, claiming he was growing more delusional, paranoid and obsessive by the day, and that he was too mentally unbalanced for them to mount any kind of defense.<ref name=\"Marks0812\" /> George Peck, the prosecutor in Ferguson's trial, insisted Ferguson's apparent lack of cooperation with his lawyers was a defense tactic to avoid a trial.<ref>{{Cite news |last=McQuiston |first=John T. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 21, 1994 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/21/nyregion/suspect-in-lirr-slayings-may-dismiss-his-lawyer.html |accessdate=November 7, 2009 | title=Suspect in L.I.R.R. Slayings May Dismiss His Lawyer}}</ref>\n\nOn August 20, 1994, Ferguson appeared before Belfi and rejected his lawyer's efforts to have him declared mentally unfit to stand trial. Ferguson spoke in a long and rambling manner, occasionally ignoring Belfi when the judge tried to interrupt him. Ferguson claimed a police officer who escorted him from the Nassau County Jail said to him; \"you realize someone else, in fact, was actually responsible for the shooting.\"<ref name=\"Marks0820\" /> When asked if Ferguson understood the role of the prosecuting attorney, Ferguson replied; \"to perpetrate injustices against me.\"<ref name=\"Marks0820\" /> Kunstler and Kuby argued Ferguson's behavior was indicative of his mental imbalance. But Belfi refused the lawyers' request to reconsider his competence, citing the original psychiatric report that concluded Ferguson was able to understand the charges against him and was \"[[malingering]] in an attempt to create an impression\" that he was mentally imbalanced and unable to cooperate with his attorney. When Belfi ended the proceeding, Ferguson tried to continue talking. After he was placed into handcuffs by guards, Ferguson shouted \"they have made it too tight,\" collapsed to the floor, and had to be dragged from the courtroom.<ref name=\"Marks0820\" /> Denis Dillon suggested Kunstler was trying to create \"such a bizarre situation\" that the court would reverse its earlier ruling regarding Ferguson's competence.<ref name=\"McQuiston0920\">{{Cite news |last=McQuiston |first=John T. |title=Lawyers in Rail Slayings File for Insanity Defense |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 20, 1994 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/20/nyregion/lawyers-in-rail-slayings-file-for-insanity-defense.html |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Removal of Kunstler and Kuby====\nOn September 20, 1994, Kunstler and Kuby filed notice that they would pursue an [[insanity defense]] despite the objections of their client. Ferguson continued to claim he was not involved in the shootings and proposed defending himself during the trial.<ref name=\"McQuiston0920\" /> In the following months, Ferguson sent Judge Belfi several letters regarding disputes between Ferguson, Kunstler and Kuby. Ferguson claimed in the letters that he was not insane, and rejected Kunstler's and Kuby's \"black rage\" defense. Although George Peck argued the letters proved Ferguson was able to understand the charges against him and was actively participating in his defense, Kuby argued the letters only further demonstrated Ferguson's confused state of mind. On November 11, Ferguson agreed he would stop resisting efforts to meet with a court-appointed psychiatrist. As a result, Judge Belfi agreed to hold a third hearing as to whether Ferguson was mentally competent to stand trial.<ref name=\"McQuiston1111\" />\n\nOn December 10, 1994, Judge Belfi ruled Ferguson was competent to stand trial. Belfi said he based his decision in part on his conversations with Ferguson in the courtroom, including Ferguson's concern over Governor Pataki's promise to sign a death-penalty bill. Belfi strongly advised Ferguson against defending himself, but Ferguson said he intended to defend himself. Kuby said of the decision, \"What we will have now is a complete circus. A crazy man cannot defend himself. Mr. Ferguson, evidence to the contrary, believes he is not guilty and that someone else killed all those people aboard the train.\" Kuby continued, \"Without a psychiatric defense, Ferguson has no defense. There was no doubt that he was there, that he fired the weapon, that he would have fired it more had he not been wrestled to the ground.

When a witness refused to answer the question to his satisfaction, he would often ask the judge to \"admonish the witness to answer the question.\" During the course of his cross-examinations, Ferguson would refer to himself in the [[Illeism|third person]], most particularly asking the victims of the shooting; \"did you see Colin Ferguson&nbsp;...\" to which the witness would reply \"I saw ''you'' shoot me.\" Legal experts pointed out that Ferguson's questions were pointless and were not geared towards rebutting testimony. By not recognizing when to object to testimony and closing arguments, he lost his right to appeal on those grounds. Among the defense witnesses Ferguson requested was President Bill Clinton.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Carlin |first=John |title=An indefensible case of murder |work=[[The Independent]] |location=[[London]] |date=February 5, 1995 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/an-indefensible-case-of-murder-1571612.html |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\nFerguson originally sought to question himself on the witness stand, but ultimately did not do so. He told the judge and media outlets he intended to call a number of witnesses who would prove his innocence, including a ballistic expert, a handwriting expert and two regular eyewitnesses, but they were afraid to come forward and take the stand. Ultimately, he did not call any of the witnesses. He also told Judge Belfi of an alleged conspiracy by the [[Jewish Defense League]] to kill him in prison if he was convicted.

The judge said, \"Colin Ferguson will never return to society, and will spend the rest of his natural life in prison.\" At the sentencing, Judge [[Donald E. Belfi]] called Ferguson a \"selfish, self-righteous coward.\" He also used the sentencing as an opportunity to criticize New York's controversial Sentencing Cap Law, which would have capped Ferguson's sentence at 50 years had no one died in the massacre because all of the felonies he committed on the train were part of one occurrence, therefore all sentences would have been served concurrently and capped at 50 years.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Judge Decries Cap On Penalty |work=[[Newsday]] |location=[[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]] |date=March 23, 1995 |page=A31}}</ref> After his conviction, Ferguson was put in the position to argue in appellate briefs that he had incompetent counsel (himself).<ref>People v.

Belfi, the Nassau County Judge assigned to the Ferguson case, criticized Kunstler for speaking to the media about the proposed defense before it had been examined by a mental health professional. Belfi said \"Mr. Kunstler may have many talents, but until he receives his medical degree with a specialty in psychiatry, these types of conclusions should best be left for medical experts and the triers of the facts.\"<ref name=\"Hoffman0423\" />\n\nBlack rage was first proposed by psychologists William Henry Grier and Price Cobbs in their 1968 book, ''[[Black Rage (book)|Black Rage]]'' ({{ISBN|1-57910-349-9}}). Grier and Cobbs argue that black people living in a racist, white supremacist society are psychologically damaged by the effects of racist oppression. They argue that this damage causes black people to act abnormally in certain situations.\n\nFerguson started to claim he was not involved in the Long Island Rail Road shootings at all, and repeatedly refused to meet with a psychiatrist chosen by Kunstler and Kuby. Ferguson told the attorneys he was receiving messages straight from God, and spoke of conspiracies to destroy him by those opposed to God.<ref name=\"Marks0812\" /> On August 12, 1994, Kunstler and Kuby asked Judge Belfi to reconsider Ferguson's competence to stand trial, claiming he was growing more delusional, paranoid and obsessive by the day, and that he was too mentally unbalanced for them to mount any kind of defense.<ref name=\"Marks0812\" /> George Peck, the prosecutor in Ferguson's trial, insisted Ferguson's apparent lack of cooperation with his lawyers was a defense tactic to avoid a trial.<ref>{{Cite news |last=McQuiston |first=John T. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 21, 1994 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/21/nyregion/suspect-in-lirr-slayings-may-dismiss-his-lawyer.html |accessdate=November 7, 2009 | title=Suspect in L.I.R.R.

Ferguson spoke in a long and rambling manner, occasionally ignoring Belfi when the judge tried to interrupt him. Ferguson claimed a police officer who escorted him from the Nassau County Jail said to him; \"you realize someone else, in fact, was actually responsible for the shooting.\"<ref name=\"Marks0820\" /> When asked if Ferguson understood the role of the prosecuting attorney, Ferguson replied; \"to perpetrate injustices against me.\"<ref name=\"Marks0820\" /> Kunstler and Kuby argued Ferguson's behavior was indicative of his mental imbalance. But Belfi refused the lawyers' request to reconsider his competence, citing the original psychiatric report that concluded Ferguson was able to understand the charges against him and was \"[[malingering]] in an attempt to create an impression\" that he was mentally imbalanced and unable to cooperate with his attorney. When Belfi ended the proceeding, Ferguson tried to continue talking. After he was placed into handcuffs by guards, Ferguson shouted \"they have made it too tight,\" collapsed to the floor, and had to be dragged from the courtroom.<ref name=\"Marks0820\" /> Denis Dillon suggested Kunstler was trying to create \"such a bizarre situation\" that the court would reverse its earlier ruling regarding Ferguson's competence.<ref name=\"McQuiston0920\">{{Cite news |last=McQuiston |first=John T. |title=Lawyers in Rail Slayings File for Insanity Defense |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 20, 1994 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/20/nyregion/lawyers-in-rail-slayings-file-for-insanity-defense.html |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Removal of Kunstler and Kuby====\nOn September 20, 1994, Kunstler and Kuby filed notice that they would pursue an [[insanity defense]] despite the objections of their client. Ferguson continued to claim he was not involved in the shootings and proposed defending himself during the trial.<ref name=\"McQuiston0920\" /> In the following months, Ferguson sent Judge Belfi several letters regarding disputes between Ferguson, Kunstler and Kuby. Ferguson claimed in the letters that he was not insane, and rejected Kunstler's and Kuby's \"black rage\" defense. Although George Peck argued the letters proved Ferguson was able to understand the charges against him and was actively participating in his defense, Kuby argued the letters only further demonstrated Ferguson's confused state of mind. On November 11, Ferguson agreed he would stop resisting efforts to meet with a court-appointed psychiatrist. As a result, Judge Belfi agreed to hold a third hearing as to whether Ferguson was mentally competent to stand trial.<ref name=\"McQuiston1111\" />\n\nOn December 10, 1994, Judge Belfi ruled Ferguson was competent to stand trial. Belfi said he based his decision in part on his conversations with Ferguson in the courtroom, including Ferguson's concern over Governor Pataki's promise to sign a death-penalty bill. Belfi strongly advised Ferguson against defending himself, but Ferguson said he intended to defend himself. Kuby said of the decision, \"What we will have now is a complete circus. A crazy man cannot defend himself. Mr. Ferguson, evidence to the contrary, believes he is not guilty and that someone else killed all those people aboard the train.\" Kuby continued, \"Without a psychiatric defense, Ferguson has no defense. There was no doubt that he was there, that he fired the weapon, that he would have fired it more had he not been wrestled to the ground.

When a witness refused to answer the question to his satisfaction, he would often ask the judge to \"admonish the witness to answer the question.\" During the course of his cross-examinations, Ferguson would refer to himself in the [[Illeism|third person]], most particularly asking the victims of the shooting; \"did you see Colin Ferguson&nbsp;...\" to which the witness would reply \"I saw ''you'' shoot me.\" Legal experts pointed out that Ferguson's questions were pointless and were not geared towards rebutting testimony. By not recognizing when to object to testimony and closing arguments, he lost his right to appeal on those grounds. Among the defense witnesses Ferguson requested was President Bill Clinton.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Carlin |first=John |title=An indefensible case of murder |work=[[The Independent]] |location=[[London]] |date=February 5, 1995 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/an-indefensible-case-of-murder-1571612.html |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}</ref>\n\nFerguson originally sought to question himself on the witness stand, but ultimately did not do so. He told the judge and media outlets he intended to call a number of witnesses who would prove his innocence, including a ballistic expert, a handwriting expert and two regular eyewitnesses, but they were afraid to come forward and take the stand. Ultimately, he did not call any of the witnesses. He also told Judge Belfi of an alleged conspiracy by the [[Jewish Defense League]] to kill him in prison if he was convicted.

The judge said, \"Colin Ferguson will never return to society, and will spend the rest of his natural life in prison.\" At the sentencing, Judge [[Donald E. Belfi]] called Ferguson a \"selfish, self-righteous coward.\" He also used the sentencing as an opportunity to criticize New York's controversial Sentencing Cap Law, which would have capped Ferguson's sentence at 50 years had no one died in the massacre because all of the felonies he committed on the train were part of one occurrence, therefore all sentences would have been served concurrently and capped at 50 years.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Judge Decries Cap On Penalty |work=[[Newsday]] |location=[[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]] |date=March 23, 1995 |page=A31}}</ref> After his conviction, Ferguson was put in the position to argue in appellate briefs that he had incompetent counsel (himself).<ref>People v.
