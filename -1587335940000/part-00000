The Aim of the League of Prizren was to unite the four Albanian-inhabited Vilayets by merging the majority of Albanian inhabitants within the Ottoman Empire into one [[Albanian Vilayet]]. However at that time Serbs were opposing the Albanian nationalism along with Turks and other Slavs in Kosovo, which disabled the Albanian movements to establish Albanian rule over Kosovo.\n\nIn [[1901 massacres of Serbs|1901, massacres of Serbs]] were carried out by Albanians in [[North Kosovo]] and [[Pristina]].\n\n===Modern period===\n[[File:Balkan Wars Boundaries.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Boundaries after the [[First Balkan War|First]] and the [[Second Balkan War]]]]\nThe arising [[Kingdom of Serbia]] planned a restoration of its rule in Kosovo as Ottoman might crumbled on the Balkan peninsula.

After Yugoslavia's name changed to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and Serbia's to the [[History of Serbia|Socialist Republic of Serbia]] in 1953, the Autonomous Region of Kosovo gained some autonomy in the 1960s. In the 1974 constitution, the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo's government received higher powers, including the highest governmental titles \u2013 President and Premier and a seat in the Federal Presidency which made it a ''de facto'' Socialist Republic within the Federation, but remaining as a Socialist Autonomous Region within the Socialist Republic of Serbia. \n[[File:Ramiz Sadiku and Boro Vukmirovi\u0107.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Ramiz Sadiku]] and [[Boro Vukmirovi\u0107]], [[Order of the People's Hero|People's Heroes of Yugoslavia]] and symbol of Serbian-Albanian friendship<ref>{{cite web|title=Prishtine \u2013 mon amour |url=http://bturn.com/events/prishtine-mon-amour|publisher=bturn.com|date=September 7, 2012}}</ref>]]\nIn 1981, Albanian students organized protests seeking that Kosovo become a Republic within Yugoslavia.

In the 1970s, an Albanian nationalist movement pursued full recognition of the Province of Kosovo as another Republic within the federation, while the most extreme elements aimed for full-scale independence. Tito's government dealt with the situation swiftly, but only gave it a temporary solution.

In 1986, the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SANU) was working on a document, which later would be known as the [[SANU Memorandum]]. An unfinished edition was filtered to the press. In the essay, SANU explained the Serbian peoples history as victims of a 500-year and more genocide from Kosovo, and therefore called for the revival of Serb nationalism. During this time, [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]'s rise to power started in the League of the Socialists of Serbia. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 used the discontent reflected in the SANU memorandum for his political goals.\n\nOne of the events that contributed to Milo\u0161evi\u0107's rise of power was the ''Gazimestan Speech'', delivered in front of 1,000,000 Serbs at the central celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the [[Battle of Kosovo]], held at [[Gazimestan]] on 28 June 1989.\n\nSoon afterwards, as approved by the Assembly in 1990, the autonomy of Kosovo was revoked back to the old status (1971).

The Aim of the League of Prizren was to unite the four Albanian-inhabited Vilayets by merging the majority of Albanian inhabitants within the Ottoman Empire into one [[Albanian Vilayet]]. However at that time Serbs were opposing the Albanian nationalism along with Turks and other Slavs in Kosovo, which disabled the Albanian movements to establish Albanian rule over Kosovo.\n\nIn [[1901 massacres of Serbs|1901, massacres of Serbs]] were carried out by Albanians in [[North Kosovo]] and [[Pristina]].\n\n===Modern period===\n[[File:Balkan Wars Boundaries.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Boundaries after the [[First Balkan War|First]] and the [[Second Balkan War]]]]\nThe arising [[Kingdom of Serbia]] planned a restoration of its rule in Kosovo as Ottoman might crumbled on the Balkan peninsula.

The monarchy was then transformed into the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].\n\nThe 1918\u20131929 period of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes witnessed a decrease in the Serbian population of the region and an increase in the number of Albanians.

The proclamation of an autonomous Kosovo by Tito and his communists was in fact a part of Tito's hope to continue the communist Yugoslavia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} He had said \"Strong Serbia, Weak Yugoslavia \u2013 Weak Serbia, Strong Yugoslavia\" Milo\u0161evi\u0107, however, did not remove Kosovo's seat from the Federal Presidency. After [[Slovenia]]'s secession from Yugoslavia in 1991, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 used the seat to attain dominance over the Federal government, outvoting his opponents.\n{{multiple image\n| footer = '''Left:''' Destroyed Serbian Orthodox [[Church of Holy Trinity, Petri\u010d|Holy Trinity Church]] in Petri\u0107 village<br />'''Right:''' Ruins of a Serb part of [[Prizren]] destroyed during [[2004 unrest in Kosovo|2004 pogrom]].\n| width1    = 250\n| image1    = Intolerance.jpg\n| width2    = 235\n| image2    = Prizren, po\u0161kozen\u00e1 srbsk\u00e1 \u010dtvr\u0165.jpg\n}}\n\n===Breakup of Yugoslavia and Kosovo War===\nAfter the [[Dayton Agreement]] of 1995, the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]], [[Albanians|ethnic-Albanian]] [[paramilitary]] organisation that sought the separation of Kosovo and the eventual creation of a [[Greater Albania]],<ref>{{cite book|title=State-building in Kosovo.

The grapefruit first appeared as an illustration entitled \"The Forbidden Fruit Tree\" in ''The Natural History of Barbados'' (1750) by Rev. Griffith Hughes. This accords with the scientific name which literally is \"citrus of paradise\". The fruit seems to have been fairly commonly available around that time since George Washington in his Barbados Journal (1750-1751) mentions \"the Forbidden Fruit\" as one of the local fruit available at a dinner party he attended. The plant was later described in the 1837 ''Flora of Jamaica'' as the Barbados Grapefruit.

After that is done, there are several scenarios in which a bill may or may not be enacted into law.\n* The president may sign the bill within 10 days (excluding Sundays). This enacts the bill into law.\n* The president may return the bill to Congress with a statement of objections within 10 days (excluding Sundays). This is a \"veto.\"\n* If the president vetoes a bill, the president's objections shall be considered by the Congress. Each house may vote to override the president's veto. If 2/3 of each house agree to override the president's veto, the bill is enacted into law.\n* The president may do nothing, and after 10 days (excluding Sundays) if Congress has not yet adjourned, the bill is enacted into law.\n* The president may do nothing, and if Congress adjourns before the 10th day (excluding Sundays), the bill is not enacted into law. This is known as \"[[pocket veto]]\". (It can't be overridden and must be reintroduced.)\n\nAlthough each case is unique and involves a plethora of influences, one general rule can be acknowledged: presidents use their prerogative to veto legislation when such legislation does not represent their viewpoint or agenda.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Lewis | first=D. | title=What Time Is It? The Use of Power in Four Different Types of Presidential Time | journal=The Journal of Politics | volume=59 | issue=3 | year=1996 | page=683}}</ref>\n\nOccasionally, a president either publicly or privately threatens Congress with a veto to influence the content or passage of legislation. There is no record of what constitutes a \"veto threat\" or how many have been made over the years, but it has become a staple of presidential politics and a sometimes effective way of shaping policy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} A president may also warn Congress of a veto of a particular bill so as to persuade Congress not to waste time passing particular legislation or including certain provisions in a bill when the president is prepared to veto it.\n\nThis list below contains many of the bills vetoed and pocket vetoed by presidents.\n\n{{Horizontal TOC}}\n\n==Summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!'''#'''\n! scope=\"col\" | President\n! scope=\"col\" | Regular<br>vetoes<ref name=VetoCounts>{{Cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/vetoCounts.htm|title=U.S. Senate: President Veto Counts|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=July 21, 2016}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Pocket veto|Pocket<br>vetoes]]<ref name=VetoCounts />\n! scope=\"col\" | Total<br>vetoes<ref name=VetoCounts />\n! scope=\"col\" | Vetoes<br>overridden<ref name=VetoCounts />\n! scope=\"col\" | % of vetoes<br>overridden<ref>Computed by dividing the \"Vetoes overridden\" column by the \"Total vetoes\" column and rounding to the nearest whole number.

On April 19, 1775, the first day of the [[American Revolutionary War]], provincial [[minutemen]] and [[Militia (United States)|militia]] companies numbering approximately 400 engaged roughly 90 [[British Army during the American Revolutionary War|British Army]] troops at this location. The battle was the first instance in which American forces advanced in formation on the British [[Regular Army|regulars]], inflicted casualties, and routed their opponents. It was a pivotal moment in the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] and in American history. The significance of the historic events at the North Bridge inspired [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] to refer to the moment as the \"[[shot heard round the world]].\"\n\nThere were at least eight iterations of the North Bridge constructed over four centuries. The current wooden pedestrian bridge, an approximate replica of the bridge that stood at the time of the battle, was built in 1956 and extensively restored in 2005. The bridge and the surrounding 114 acres of land make up what is known as the North Bridge unit of the [[Minute Man National Historical Park]] and is managed by the [[National Park Service]]. It is a popular tourist destination.\n\n==Origin and earliest iterations==\nThe Town of Concord was settled in 1635. Over the next two decades, colonial settlers established farms in the north quarter of the town. Many of these farms lay on the opposite side of the Concord River from the town center. To facilitate travel from their farms to the town, north quarter land owners built a bridge over the Concord River at or near this location by the early 1650s. The first mention of a bridge at this location appears in town records in 1654.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=12}} The farm road crossing the bridge was later improved and came to be known as the [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]] Road.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=14}}\n\nSpring flooding of the river and deterioration required the replacement of the bridge approximately every 20 to 30 years. Colonial records suggest that the bridge was likely replaced in 1660, again around 1683, again around 1710, and again in 1731.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=16}}{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=18}} In 1760, the town constructed a new bridge at this site. This version was the one that was present during the Concord Fight on April 19, 1775.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=19}}\n\n==\"Concord Fight\"==\n{{main|Battle of Concord#The North Bridge}}\n[[File:North Bridge Fight Detail.jpg|thumb|A 1775 drawing by [[Amos Doolittle]] of the engagement at the North Bridge based on witness accounts his own inspection of the bridge]]The engagement which took place at the North Bridge has historically been known as the \"Concord Fight\" and was a part of the larger [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]]. On April 18, 1775, General [[Thomas Gage]], the military Governor of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], dispatched a force of roughly 700 British soldiers from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] to confiscate or destroy military supplies being stockpiled in Concord by the rebellious [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]].{{sfnp|Galvin|1989|p=99}} On their way to Concord, this force encountered a small group of militia on [[Lexington Battle Green|Lexington Green]]. After a brief skirmish there, the British soldiers marched on to Concord. Soon after reaching the town, [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Francis Smith (British Army officer)|Francis Smith]] sent six [[Company (military unit)|companies]] across the North Bridge to search provincial Colonel [[James Barrett (colonel)|Colonel James Barrett's]] farm for munitions. Three of these companies went on to Barrett's farm while three, totaling roughly 90 men, held the North Bridge. These were the British [[light infantry]] companies from the 4th, 10th, and 43rd Regiments of Foot under [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] Walter Laurie.{{sfnp|Galvin|1989|pp=140-141}} These companies initially held positions on the western side of the bridge but when the provincials advanced, they crossed the bridge and took up a position on the eastern bank.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=26}}\n\nAt about 10:30, the provincials advanced in military order with the intention of taking the bridge and moving on to the center of town to prevent the British from burning the village.{{sfnp|Fischer|1994|p=211}} As they advanced the British fired a few warning shots followed by a full volley. Several provincials were killed or wounded in this first round of firing. Seeing these casualties, Major John Buttrick of Concord, in command of the provincial column, commanded, \"Fire, fellow soldiers, for God's sake fire!\" and the provincials returned fire, causing the British to immediately retreat back to Concord.{{sfnp|Fischer|1994|p=214}} Three British soldiers were killed and nine wounded. On the provincial side two were killed and four wounded.{{sfnp|Minute Man National Historical Park|2020|}}\n\nThis first instance of Americans fighting in military order and firing to deadly effect on British troops was a key turning point in the Battles of Lexington and Concord. It precipitated the British retreat back to Boston and is regarded as one of the most significant events in American history.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=12}}\n\n==Later iterations of the bridge==\n[[File:The Cambridge book of poetry and song (1882) (14780275725).jpg|thumb|upright|An 1882 drawing of the Centennial Bridge with covered pavilions]]In 1788, a new bridge was constructed to replace the 1760 structure which had been in place during the battle. As with prior iterations, those with farms adjacent to the bridge paid for the replacement. In 1788 these included Captain David Brown, Lieutenant Elisha Jones, and Colonel John Buttrick, all of whom had fought at the North Bridge in 1775.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=29}} In 1793, Concord constructed a new bridge several hundred yards downriver of the North Bridge, making the latter obsolete. The road was diverted to the new bridge and the old road over the North Bridge was abandoned by the town. That same year, the town authorized Elisha Jones to tear down the North Bridge.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=30}} For the next 82 years, no bridge stood at the site.\n\nIn 1874, as plans for the celebration of the centennial of the battle, the Town of Concord appointed a committee to oversee the placement of a monument on the west side of the river where the first minutemen died during the battle. They were also charge with rebuilding the North Bridge.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=75}} The new structure would not be open to traffic but instead would serve strictly as part of the larger memorial, providing access to the new statue and demonstrating to visitors what the area looked like on the first day of the Revolution. The centennial version of the North Bridge, constructed in 1874, has been described as \"whimsical\" and overly rustic, representing a Victorian era interpretation of what a colonial bridge looked like.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=76}} The architect was William Ralph Emerson, cousin to Ralph Waldo Emerson, Concord's famed writer and transcendentalist.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=76}} The most unusual features of the Centennial Bridge were its two pavilions or covered arbors protruding from either side of the center of the bridge covered with interwoven twigs, reminiscent of a Polynesian style.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=76}}\n\nThe Centennial Bridge was washed away during the spring [[freshet]] of 1888. It was replaced by a more austere bridge that same year. William R. Emerson also designed this bridge but left out the unusual decorative flourishes of his Centennial Bridge. Despite attempts to make the 1888 bridge stronger with large oak pilings and cross beams, it too was washed out by spring floods in 1909.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=58}} The bridge was replaced by the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] in 1909. The architect was Joseph R. Worcester. The bridge had the appearance of historical accuracy in that it closely resembled the bridge as depicted by Doolittle, however many disliked it due to the fact that it was made of concrete.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=58}}\n\n==Existing bridge==\n[[File:Concord Old North Bridge.JPG|thumb|Left to right: the 1836 Battle Monument, the 1956 Old North Bridge (restored in 2005), and \"The Minute Man\" statue by [[Daniel Chester French]] ]]In 1955 the 1909 concrete bridge was damaged beyond repair by flooding due to [[Hurricane Diane]].{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=8}} This took place as the town was considering numerous landscape architectural plans to better preserve the monuments at the site and the surrounding grounds.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=98}} Concord residents mounted protests, urging that the new commemorative bridge should be made of wood and not concrete. Massachusetts politicians including Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Works and future Governor [[John Volpe]] and the current Governor [[Christian Herter]] pressed for funding from Congress but this failed to pass. In 1956 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts undertook construction of a new bridge.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=122}} \n\nThe state engaged the architectural firm of Whitman and Howard to design the new bridge. Working for that firm, architect Howard Perkins was responsible for drafting the plans. Perkins closely examined the Doolittle drawing and came up with an interpretation based on the drawing. His design featured, according to architectural conservator Judith Q. Sullivan, \"an arched [[pile bridge|pile]] [[Bent Bridge|bent bridge]] consisting of six bents of three piles each.\" Perkins omitted some features evident in the Doolittle design and incorporated others not present for the sake of stability. The most prominent of these added features are the pile header beams which extend on either side of the bridge platform and the cross braces connected to them. These provide strength but also allow flexibility during floods{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=128}} The 1956 bridge used pressure treated wood but incorporated hand hewn timbers for an authentic appearance. The bridge is 109 feet and 8 inches long between [[abutment|abutments]]. Construction was completed in September 1956 and dedicated on September 29, 1956 by Governor Herter.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=125 and 130}}\n\nIn 1959, the bridge and surrounding land became part of the Minute Man National Historical Park. When the park was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1966, the bridge was listed as \"a contributing structure which illustrates the continuing commemorative importance of the place.\"{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=2}} In 2002, an engineering conditions assessment of the bridge was conducted and found significant deterioration. After further preservation studies, Minute Man National Historical Park embarked on an extensive restoration of the bridge in 2005.\n\n==Monuments placed at the site==\n===1836 Battle Monument===\n[[File: Minute Man National Park, Concord, MA.jpg|thumb|]]\nIn 1835, when there was no bridge at the site, Rev. [[Ezra Ripley]], who resided nearby at the [[Old Manse]], donated a narrow parcel of land to the town. This parcel would allow public access from Monument Street to the proposed site of a monument on the east bank where the Old North Bridge had stood. The parcel included a section of the old Groton Road which once led to the bridge as well as the grave sites of two British soldiers who were killed in the fight and buried nearby the bridge.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=35}} The town of Concord erected the 1836 Battle Monument (as it is now known) with funds donated by the [[Bunker Hill Monument]] Association. The obelisk was designed by Solomon Willard and placed on the land donated by Ripley, near where the east abutment of the bridge had been. The inscription on the monument reads, \"HERE On the 19 of April, 1775, was made the first forcible resistance to British aggression / On the opposite Bank stood the American Militia / Here stood the Invading Army and on this spot the first of the Enemy fell in the War of that Revolution which gave Independence to these United States / In gratitude to GOD and In the love of Freedom this Monument was erected AD. 1836.\"\n\nConcord dedicated the monument on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], July 4, 1837. Congressman [[Samuel Hoar]] gave the dedication address. For the occasion, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote his \"[[Concord Hymn]].\" The first, and best known, of the four stanzas of this poem is:\n\n<poem>::By the rude bridge that arched the flood,\n::Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,\n::Here once the embattled farmers stood\n::And fired the shot heard round the world.</poem>\n\n===\"The Minute Man\" statue===\n\n[[File:Minute Man Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|\"The Minute Man\" by French]]The location of the 1836 Battle Monument did not sit well with some in Concord. Because there was no longer a bridge, the obelisk had been placed on the eastern bank where the British had stood during the Concord Fight. A Concord farmer named Ebenezer Hubbard was particularly annoyed that the spot where the the first Americans had lost their lives during the Concord Fight remained unmarked. Upon his death in 1870, he left the Town of Concord $1,000 to place a monument on the west side of the Concord River and to reconstruct the Old North Bridge to provide access to it. The residents of Concord pressed to finish both the new bridge and monument in time for the centennial celebration in 1875.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=6}}\n\n[[Daniel Chester French]], then 21 years old, was engaged by the Monument Committee to sculpt a statue representing a minuteman. Although commissioned to sculpt a generic provincial soldier, French was inspired by the story of Capt. [[Isaac Davis (soldier)|Isaac Davis]] of [[Acton, Massachusetts]]. Davis commanded the company which led the advance on the Old North Bridge. He was among the first killed and the first American officer killed in action during the Revolution.{{sfnp|Fischer|1994|p=211}} French attempted to model the facial features of his statue after photographs of Isaac Davis's descendants.{{sfnp|Robbins|1945|p=20}}\n\nThe statue was cast from melted down Civil War cannons at the [[Ames Manufacturing Company|Ames Foundry]]. It was French's first public work and was well received. French is best known for his 1920 statue, [[Abraham Lincoln (1920 statue)|\"Abraham Lincoln\"]], in the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. \"The Minute Man\" has been used as the symbol of the [[United States National Guard]] on coins such as the Massachusetts [[50 State quarters|state quarter]].\n\n===Graves of British soldiers===\n[[File:British Soldiers Grave - Old North Bridge.jpg|thumb|1910 marker for the grave of two British soldiers]]Three British soldiers were killed during the Concord Fight. They were Privates James Hall, Thomas Smith and Patrick Gray, all of the [[4th Regiment of Foot]]. One of these men was carried to Concord center, died and was buried there. Two others died at the bridge and were buried adjacent to a stone wall forming the boundary of the Old Manse property. It is not known which of the three are buried at the Old North Bridge site.{{sfnp|Minute Man National Historical Park|2020|}} Initially, their graves were simply marked by two plain stones. [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], who resided at the Old Manse for a time, called these a \"humbler...yet more interesting\" token of the Concord Fight than the 1836 Battle Monument.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=38}}\n\nIn 1875, a granite slab simply inscribed, \"Grave of the British Soldiers\" was installed in time for the centennial.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=6}} In 1910 residents of Concord placed a more substantial granite marker inscribed with a stanza from [[James Russell Lowell|James Russell Lowell's]] 1849 poem, \"Lines, Suggested By the Graves of Two English Soldiers On Concord Battle-Ground:\"\n\n<poem>::They came three thousand miles and died\n::To keep the past upon its throne:\n::Unheard, beyond the ocean tide,\n::Their English Mother made her moan.</poem>\n\n==1975 Bicentennial Commemoration==\nOn the 200th anniversary of the battle, President [[Gerald Ford]] gave a speech at the bridge as part of the [[United States Bicentennial]] celebrations. A crowd of over 15,000 people attended the exercises.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=132}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite web |last=Dietrich-Smith |first=Deborah |title=Cultural Landscape Report: North Bridge Unit|publisher=Minute Man National Historical Park |date=2003 |url=https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/management/upload/MIMA%20NB%20CLR%20-%20combined%20.pdfs.pdf |ref=harv }}\n*{{cite book |title=Paul Revere's Ride |last=Fischer|first=David Hackett |authorlink=David Hackett Fischer |year=1994|place=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195088476 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u_Ow0uAM3EAC |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |title=The Minute Men: The First Fight: Myths and Realities of the American Revolution|last=Galvin|first=John R.|authorlink= |year=1989|place=Washington |publisher=Pergamon-Brassey's International Defense Publisher |isbn=9780080367330 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cWaE3FzRuH0C|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite web |last=Minute Man National Historical Park |first= |title=North Bridge Questions|publisher=National Park Service |date=2020 |url=https://www.nps.gov/mima/north-bridge-questions.htm |ref=harv }}\n*{{cite book |title=The Story of the Minutemen Man|last=Robbins|first=Roland Wells |authorlink= |year=1945|place=Stoneham, Massachusetts |publisher=George R.

Over the next two decades, colonial settlers established farms in the north quarter of the town. Many of these farms lay on the opposite side of the Concord River from the town center. To facilitate travel from their farms to the town, north quarter land owners built a bridge over the Concord River at or near this location by the early 1650s. The first mention of a bridge at this location appears in town records in 1654.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=12}} The farm road crossing the bridge was later improved and came to be known as the [[Groton, Massachusetts|Groton]] Road.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=14}}\n\nSpring flooding of the river and deterioration required the replacement of the bridge approximately every 20 to 30 years. Colonial records suggest that the bridge was likely replaced in 1660, again around 1683, again around 1710, and again in 1731.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=16}}{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=18}} In 1760, the town constructed a new bridge at this site. This version was the one that was present during the Concord Fight on April 19, 1775.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=19}}\n\n==\"Concord Fight\"==\n{{main|Battle of Concord#The North Bridge}}\n[[File:North Bridge Fight Detail.jpg|thumb|A 1775 drawing by [[Amos Doolittle]] of the engagement at the North Bridge based on witness accounts his own inspection of the bridge]]The engagement which took place at the North Bridge has historically been known as the \"Concord Fight\" and was a part of the larger [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]]. On April 18, 1775, General [[Thomas Gage]], the military Governor of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], dispatched a force of roughly 700 British soldiers from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] to confiscate or destroy military supplies being stockpiled in Concord by the rebellious [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]].{{sfnp|Galvin|1989|p=99}} On their way to Concord, this force encountered a small group of militia on [[Lexington Battle Green|Lexington Green]]. After a brief skirmish there, the British soldiers marched on to Concord. Soon after reaching the town, [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Francis Smith (British Army officer)|Francis Smith]] sent six [[Company (military unit)|companies]] across the North Bridge to search provincial Colonel [[James Barrett (colonel)|Colonel James Barrett's]] farm for munitions. Three of these companies went on to Barrett's farm while three, totaling roughly 90 men, held the North Bridge. These were the British [[light infantry]] companies from the 4th, 10th, and 43rd Regiments of Foot under [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] Walter Laurie.{{sfnp|Galvin|1989|pp=140-141}} These companies initially held positions on the western side of the bridge but when the provincials advanced, they crossed the bridge and took up a position on the eastern bank.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=26}}\n\nAt about 10:30, the provincials advanced in military order with the intention of taking the bridge and moving on to the center of town to prevent the British from burning the village.{{sfnp|Fischer|1994|p=211}} As they advanced the British fired a few warning shots followed by a full volley. Several provincials were killed or wounded in this first round of firing. Seeing these casualties, Major John Buttrick of Concord, in command of the provincial column, commanded, \"Fire, fellow soldiers, for God's sake fire!\" and the provincials returned fire, causing the British to immediately retreat back to Concord.{{sfnp|Fischer|1994|p=214}} Three British soldiers were killed and nine wounded. On the provincial side two were killed and four wounded.{{sfnp|Minute Man National Historical Park|2020|}}\n\nThis first instance of Americans fighting in military order and firing to deadly effect on British troops was a key turning point in the Battles of Lexington and Concord. It precipitated the British retreat back to Boston and is regarded as one of the most significant events in American history.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=12}}\n\n==Later iterations of the bridge==\n[[File:The Cambridge book of poetry and song (1882) (14780275725).jpg|thumb|upright|An 1882 drawing of the Centennial Bridge with covered pavilions]]In 1788, a new bridge was constructed to replace the 1760 structure which had been in place during the battle. As with prior iterations, those with farms adjacent to the bridge paid for the replacement. In 1788 these included Captain David Brown, Lieutenant Elisha Jones, and Colonel John Buttrick, all of whom had fought at the North Bridge in 1775.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=29}} In 1793, Concord constructed a new bridge several hundred yards downriver of the North Bridge, making the latter obsolete. The road was diverted to the new bridge and the old road over the North Bridge was abandoned by the town. That same year, the town authorized Elisha Jones to tear down the North Bridge.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=30}} For the next 82 years, no bridge stood at the site.\n\nIn 1874, as plans for the celebration of the centennial of the battle, the Town of Concord appointed a committee to oversee the placement of a monument on the west side of the river where the first minutemen died during the battle. They were also charge with rebuilding the North Bridge.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=75}} The new structure would not be open to traffic but instead would serve strictly as part of the larger memorial, providing access to the new statue and demonstrating to visitors what the area looked like on the first day of the Revolution. The centennial version of the North Bridge, constructed in 1874, has been described as \"whimsical\" and overly rustic, representing a Victorian era interpretation of what a colonial bridge looked like.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=76}} The architect was William Ralph Emerson, cousin to Ralph Waldo Emerson, Concord's famed writer and transcendentalist.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=76}} The most unusual features of the Centennial Bridge were its two pavilions or covered arbors protruding from either side of the center of the bridge covered with interwoven twigs, reminiscent of a Polynesian style.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=76}}\n\nThe Centennial Bridge was washed away during the spring [[freshet]] of 1888. It was replaced by a more austere bridge that same year. William R. Emerson also designed this bridge but left out the unusual decorative flourishes of his Centennial Bridge. Despite attempts to make the 1888 bridge stronger with large oak pilings and cross beams, it too was washed out by spring floods in 1909.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=58}} The bridge was replaced by the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] in 1909. The architect was Joseph R. Worcester. The bridge had the appearance of historical accuracy in that it closely resembled the bridge as depicted by Doolittle, however many disliked it due to the fact that it was made of concrete.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=58}}\n\n==Existing bridge==\n[[File:Concord Old North Bridge.JPG|thumb|Left to right: the 1836 Battle Monument, the 1956 Old North Bridge (restored in 2005), and \"The Minute Man\" statue by [[Daniel Chester French]] ]]In 1955 the 1909 concrete bridge was damaged beyond repair by flooding due to [[Hurricane Diane]].{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=8}} This took place as the town was considering numerous landscape architectural plans to better preserve the monuments at the site and the surrounding grounds.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=98}} Concord residents mounted protests, urging that the new commemorative bridge should be made of wood and not concrete. Massachusetts politicians including Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Works and future Governor [[John Volpe]] and the current Governor [[Christian Herter]] pressed for funding from Congress but this failed to pass. In 1956 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts undertook construction of a new bridge.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=122}} \n\nThe state engaged the architectural firm of Whitman and Howard to design the new bridge. Working for that firm, architect Howard Perkins was responsible for drafting the plans. Perkins closely examined the Doolittle drawing and came up with an interpretation based on the drawing. His design featured, according to architectural conservator Judith Q. Sullivan, \"an arched [[pile bridge|pile]] [[Bent Bridge|bent bridge]] consisting of six bents of three piles each.\" Perkins omitted some features evident in the Doolittle design and incorporated others not present for the sake of stability. The most prominent of these added features are the pile header beams which extend on either side of the bridge platform and the cross braces connected to them. These provide strength but also allow flexibility during floods{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=128}} The 1956 bridge used pressure treated wood but incorporated hand hewn timbers for an authentic appearance. The bridge is 109 feet and 8 inches long between [[abutment|abutments]]. Construction was completed in September 1956 and dedicated on September 29, 1956 by Governor Herter.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=125 and 130}}\n\nIn 1959, the bridge and surrounding land became part of the Minute Man National Historical Park. When the park was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1966, the bridge was listed as \"a contributing structure which illustrates the continuing commemorative importance of the place.\"{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=2}} In 2002, an engineering conditions assessment of the bridge was conducted and found significant deterioration. After further preservation studies, Minute Man National Historical Park embarked on an extensive restoration of the bridge in 2005.\n\n==Monuments placed at the site==\n===1836 Battle Monument===\n[[File: Minute Man National Park, Concord, MA.jpg|thumb|]]\nIn 1835, when there was no bridge at the site, Rev. [[Ezra Ripley]], who resided nearby at the [[Old Manse]], donated a narrow parcel of land to the town. This parcel would allow public access from Monument Street to the proposed site of a monument on the east bank where the Old North Bridge had stood. The parcel included a section of the old Groton Road which once led to the bridge as well as the grave sites of two British soldiers who were killed in the fight and buried nearby the bridge.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=35}} The town of Concord erected the 1836 Battle Monument (as it is now known) with funds donated by the [[Bunker Hill Monument]] Association. The obelisk was designed by Solomon Willard and placed on the land donated by Ripley, near where the east abutment of the bridge had been. The inscription on the monument reads, \"HERE On the 19 of April, 1775, was made the first forcible resistance to British aggression / On the opposite Bank stood the American Militia / Here stood the Invading Army and on this spot the first of the Enemy fell in the War of that Revolution which gave Independence to these United States / In gratitude to GOD and In the love of Freedom this Monument was erected AD. 1836.\"\n\nConcord dedicated the monument on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], July 4, 1837. Congressman [[Samuel Hoar]] gave the dedication address. For the occasion, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote his \"[[Concord Hymn]].\" The first, and best known, of the four stanzas of this poem is:\n\n<poem>::By the rude bridge that arched the flood,\n::Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,\n::Here once the embattled farmers stood\n::And fired the shot heard round the world.</poem>\n\n===\"The Minute Man\" statue===\n\n[[File:Minute Man Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|\"The Minute Man\" by French]]The location of the 1836 Battle Monument did not sit well with some in Concord. Because there was no longer a bridge, the obelisk had been placed on the eastern bank where the British had stood during the Concord Fight. A Concord farmer named Ebenezer Hubbard was particularly annoyed that the spot where the the first Americans had lost their lives during the Concord Fight remained unmarked. Upon his death in 1870, he left the Town of Concord $1,000 to place a monument on the west side of the Concord River and to reconstruct the Old North Bridge to provide access to it. The residents of Concord pressed to finish both the new bridge and monument in time for the centennial celebration in 1875.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=6}}\n\n[[Daniel Chester French]], then 21 years old, was engaged by the Monument Committee to sculpt a statue representing a minuteman. Although commissioned to sculpt a generic provincial soldier, French was inspired by the story of Capt. [[Isaac Davis (soldier)|Isaac Davis]] of [[Acton, Massachusetts]]. Davis commanded the company which led the advance on the Old North Bridge. He was among the first killed and the first American officer killed in action during the Revolution.{{sfnp|Fischer|1994|p=211}} French attempted to model the facial features of his statue after photographs of Isaac Davis's descendants.{{sfnp|Robbins|1945|p=20}}\n\nThe statue was cast from melted down Civil War cannons at the [[Ames Manufacturing Company|Ames Foundry]]. It was French's first public work and was well received. French is best known for his 1920 statue, [[Abraham Lincoln (1920 statue)|\"Abraham Lincoln\"]], in the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. \"The Minute Man\" has been used as the symbol of the [[United States National Guard]] on coins such as the Massachusetts [[50 State quarters|state quarter]].\n\n===Graves of British soldiers===\n[[File:British Soldiers Grave - Old North Bridge.jpg|thumb|1910 marker for the grave of two British soldiers]]Three British soldiers were killed during the Concord Fight. They were Privates James Hall, Thomas Smith and Patrick Gray, all of the [[4th Regiment of Foot]]. One of these men was carried to Concord center, died and was buried there. Two others died at the bridge and were buried adjacent to a stone wall forming the boundary of the Old Manse property. It is not known which of the three are buried at the Old North Bridge site.{{sfnp|Minute Man National Historical Park|2020|}} Initially, their graves were simply marked by two plain stones. [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], who resided at the Old Manse for a time, called these a \"humbler...yet more interesting\" token of the Concord Fight than the 1836 Battle Monument.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=38}}\n\nIn 1875, a granite slab simply inscribed, \"Grave of the British Soldiers\" was installed in time for the centennial.{{sfnp|Dietrich-Smith|2003|p=6}} In 1910 residents of Concord placed a more substantial granite marker inscribed with a stanza from [[James Russell Lowell|James Russell Lowell's]] 1849 poem, \"Lines, Suggested By the Graves of Two English Soldiers On Concord Battle-Ground:\"\n\n<poem>::They came three thousand miles and died\n::To keep the past upon its throne:\n::Unheard, beyond the ocean tide,\n::Their English Mother made her moan.</poem>\n\n==1975 Bicentennial Commemoration==\nOn the 200th anniversary of the battle, President [[Gerald Ford]] gave a speech at the bridge as part of the [[United States Bicentennial]] celebrations. A crowd of over 15,000 people attended the exercises.{{sfnp|Sullivan|2004|p=132}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite web |last=Dietrich-Smith |first=Deborah |title=Cultural Landscape Report: North Bridge Unit|publisher=Minute Man National Historical Park |date=2003 |url=https://www.nps.gov/mima/learn/management/upload/MIMA%20NB%20CLR%20-%20combined%20.pdfs.pdf |ref=harv }}\n*{{cite book |title=Paul Revere's Ride |last=Fischer|first=David Hackett |authorlink=David Hackett Fischer |year=1994|place=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195088476 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=u_Ow0uAM3EAC |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |title=The Minute Men: The First Fight: Myths and Realities of the American Revolution|last=Galvin|first=John R.|authorlink= |year=1989|place=Washington |publisher=Pergamon-Brassey's International Defense Publisher |isbn=9780080367330 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cWaE3FzRuH0C|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite web |last=Minute Man National Historical Park |first= |title=North Bridge Questions|publisher=National Park Service |date=2020 |url=https://www.nps.gov/mima/north-bridge-questions.htm |ref=harv }}\n*{{cite book |title=The Story of the Minutemen Man|last=Robbins|first=Roland Wells |authorlink= |year=1945|place=Stoneham, Massachusetts |publisher=George R.
