The state is bordered by [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]] to the south and [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Vermont]] to the east. The state has a [[Maritime boundary|maritime border]] with [[Rhode Island]], east of Long Island, as well as an [[Canada\u2013United States border|international border]] with the [[Canadian provinces]] of [[Quebec]] to the north and [[Ontario]] to the northwest. The southern part of the state is in the [[Atlantic coastal plain]] and includes Long Island and several smaller associated islands, as well as New York City and the lower [[Hudson River Valley]]. The large [[Upstate New York]] region comprises several ranges of the wider [[Appalachian Mountains]], and the [[Adirondack Mountains]] in the [[North Country (New York)|Northeastern lobe]] of the state. The north\u2013south Hudson River Valley and the east\u2013west [[Mohawk River]] Valley bisect these more mountainous regions. [[Western New York]] is considered part of the [[Great Lakes region]] and borders [[Lake Ontario]], [[Lake Erie]], and [[Niagara Falls]]. The central part of the state is dominated by the [[Finger Lakes]], a popular vacation and tourist destination.\n\nNew York had been inhabited by tribes of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] and [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for several hundred years by the time the earliest Europeans came to New York. [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonists]] and [[Jesuit missionaries]] arrived southward from [[Montreal]] for trade and [[proselytism|proselytizing]]. In 1609, the region was visited by [[Henry Hudson]] sailing for the [[Dutch East India Company]]. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] built [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]] in 1614 at the confluence of the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Mohawk River|Mohawk]] rivers, where the present-day capital of Albany later developed. The Dutch soon also settled [[New Amsterdam]] and parts of the Hudson Valley, establishing the multicultural colony of [[New Netherland]], a center of trade and immigration.

Trying to corner trade with the Europeans, they targeted other tribes. The Mohawk were also known for refusing white settlement on their land and banishing any of their people who converted to Christianity. They posed a major threat to the Abenaki and Mohicans, while the Susquehannock briefly conquered the Lenape in the 1600s. The most devastating event of the century, however, was the [[Beaver Wars]]. From approximately 1640\u20131680, Iroquoian peoples waged campaigns which extended from modern-day Michigan to Virginia against Algonquian and Siouan tribes, as well as each other. The aim was to control more land for animal trapping, a career most natives had turned to in hopes of trading with whites first. This completely changed the ethnography of the region, and most large game was hunted out before whites ever fully explored the land. Still, afterward, the Iroquois Confederacy offered shelter to refugees of the [[Mascouten]], Erie, [[Neutral Nation|Chonnonton]], [[Tutelo]], [[Saponi]], and [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] nations.

The success of the [[patroon]]ship of [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|Rensselaerswyck]] (1630), which surrounded Albany and lasted until the mid-19th century, was also a key factor in the early success of the colony.

In the United States, the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] did not assume direct jurisdiction for immigration until 1890. Prior to this time, the matter was delegated to the individual states, then via contract between the states and the federal government. Most immigrants to New York would disembark at the bustling docks along the Hudson and [[East River]]s, in the eventual [[Lower Manhattan]]. On May 4, 1847, the [[New York State Legislature]] created the Board of Commissioners of Immigration to regulate immigration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/elis/castle_garden.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110063703/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/elis/castle_garden.pdf|archivedate=November 10, 2013 |title=Castle Garden as An Immigrant Depot:1855\u20131890 |publisher=National Park Service|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe first permanent immigration depot in New York was established in 1855 at [[Castle Clinton|Castle Garden]], a converted [[War of 1812]] era fort located within what is now [[Battery Park]], at the tip of Lower Manhattan. The first immigrants to arrive at the new depot were aboard three ships that had just been released from [[quarantine]]. Castle Garden served as New York's immigrant depot until it closed on April 18, 1890, when the federal government assumed control over immigration. During that period, more than eight million immigrants passed through its doors (two of every three U.S. immigrants).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/cacl/index.htm |title=Castle Clinton |publisher=National Park Service|date=August 22, 2013 |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhen the federal government assumed control, it established the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|Bureau of Immigration]], which chose the three-acre Ellis Island in [[Upper New York Bay|Upper New York Harbor]] for an entry depot. Already federally controlled, the island had served as an ammunition depot. It was chosen due its relative isolation with proximity to New York City and the rail lines of [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], via a short ferry ride. While the island was being developed and expanded via [[land reclamation]], the federal government operated a temporary depot at the Barge Office at the Battery.<ref>Vincent J. Cannato: ''American Passage: The History of Ellis Island''. p.50: Harper Collins (2009) {{ISBN|0060742739}}</ref>\n\nEllis Island opened on January 1, 1892, and operated as a central immigration center until the [[Immigration Act of 1924|National Origins Act]] was passed in 1924, reducing immigration. After that date, the only immigrants to pass through were [[displaced persons]] or war [[refugees]]. The island ceased all immigration processing on November 12, 1954, when the last person detained on the island, [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] seaman Arne Peterssen, was released. He had overstayed his shore leave and left on the 10:15&nbsp;a.m. Manhattan-bound ferry to return to his ship.\n\nMore than twelve million immigrants passed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954. More than a hundred million Americans across the United States can trace their [[ancestry]] to these immigrants.\n\nEllis Island was the subject of a contentious and long-running border and jurisdictional dispute between New York State and the State of New Jersey, as both claimed it. The issue was settled in 1998 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] which ruled that the original {{convert|3.3|acre|adj=on}} island was New York State territory and that the balance of the {{convert|27.5|acres|0|abbr=on}} added after 1834 by landfill was in New Jersey.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/27/nyregion/ellis-island-verdict-ruling-high-court-gives-new-jersey-most-ellis-island.html|title=The Ellis Island Verdict: The Ruling|author=Linda Greenhouse|date=May 27, 1998|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref> The island was added to the [[National Park Service]] system in May 1965 by President [[Lyndon B.

Upstate New York experiences warm summers, marred by only occasional, brief intervals of sultry conditions, with long and cold winters. Western New York, particularly the Tug Hill region, receives heavy [[lake-effect snow]]s, especially during the earlier portions of winter, before the surface of Lake Ontario itself is covered by ice. The summer climate is cool in the Adirondacks, Catskills, and at higher elevations of the Southern Tier.\n\nSummer daytime temperatures usually range from the upper 70s to mid-80s \u00b0F (25 to 29&nbsp;\u00b0C), over much of the state.

The [[Secretary of State of New York|Secretary of State]], formerly an elected officer, is currently appointed by the Governor.\n\nThe [[New York State Legislature]] is [[bicameral]] and consists of the [[New York State Senate]] and the [[New York State Assembly]]. The Assembly consists of 150 members, while the Senate varies in its number of members, currently having 63. The Legislature is empowered to make laws, subject to the Governor's power to [[veto]] a bill. However, the veto may be overridden by the Legislature if there is a [[supermajority|two-thirds majority]] in favor of overriding in each House. The permanent laws of a general nature are [[codification (law)|codified]] in the ''[[Consolidated Laws of New York]]''.\n\nThe highest court of appeal in the [[Judiciary of New York|Unified Court System]] is the [[New York State Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] whereas the primary [[felony]] [[trial court]] is the [[New York County Court|County Court]] (or the [[New York Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in New York City). The Supreme Court also acts as the intermediate appellate court for many cases, and the local courts handle a variety of other matters including [[small claims]], traffic ticket cases, and local [[zoning]] matters, and are the starting point for all criminal cases. The [[New York City courts]] make up the largest local court system.\n\nThe [[administrative divisions of New York|state is divided]] into counties, cities, towns, and villages, all of which are [[municipal corporation]]s with respect to their own governments, as well as various corporate entities that serve single purposes that are also local governments, such as school districts, fire districts, and [[New York state public-benefit corporations]], frequently known as ''authorities'' or ''development corporations''. Each municipal corporation is granted varying [[home rule]] powers as provided by the New York Constitution. The state also has 10 [[Indian reservation]]s. There have been several movements regarding [[Partition and secession in New York|secession from the state of New York]]. Proposals have included a state of [[Long Island]], consisting of everything on the island outside New York City; a state called Niagara, the [[Western New York|western counties]] of New York state; the northern counties of New York state called [[Upstate New York]]; making the city of New York a state; a proposal for a new [[Peconic County]] on eastern Long Island; and for the borough of [[Staten Island]] to secede from New York City.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Capital punishment===\n\n{{Main|Capital punishment in New York}}\n\n[[Capital punishment in the United States|Capital punishment]] was reintroduced in 1995 under the [[George Pataki#Death penalty|Pataki administration]], but the statute was declared unconstitutional in 2004, when the [[New York Court of Appeals]] ruled in ''[[People v. LaValle]]'' that it violated the [[New York Constitution|state constitution]]. The remaining death sentence was commuted by the court to [[life imprisonment]] in 2007, in ''People v. John Taylor'', and the death row was disestablished in 2008, under executive order from [[David Paterson|Governor Paterson]]. No execution has taken place in New York since 1963.

The state is bordered by [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]] to the south and [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Vermont]] to the east. The state has a [[Maritime boundary|maritime border]] with [[Rhode Island]], east of Long Island, as well as an [[Canada\u2013United States border|international border]] with the [[Canadian provinces]] of [[Quebec]] to the north and [[Ontario]] to the northwest. The southern part of the state is in the [[Atlantic coastal plain]] and includes Long Island and several smaller associated islands, as well as New York City and the lower [[Hudson River Valley]]. The large [[Upstate New York]] region comprises several ranges of the wider [[Appalachian Mountains]], and the [[Adirondack Mountains]] in the [[North Country (New York)|Northeastern lobe]] of the state. The north\u2013south Hudson River Valley and the east\u2013west [[Mohawk River]] Valley bisect these more mountainous regions. [[Western New York]] is considered part of the [[Great Lakes region]] and borders [[Lake Ontario]], [[Lake Erie]], and [[Niagara Falls]]. The central part of the state is dominated by the [[Finger Lakes]], a popular vacation and tourist destination.\n\nNew York had been inhabited by tribes of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] and [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for several hundred years by the time the earliest Europeans came to New York. [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonists]] and [[Jesuit missionaries]] arrived southward from [[Montreal]] for trade and [[proselytism|proselytizing]]. In 1609, the region was visited by [[Henry Hudson]] sailing for the [[Dutch East India Company]]. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] built [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]] in 1614 at the confluence of the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Mohawk River|Mohawk]] rivers, where the present-day capital of Albany later developed. The Dutch soon also settled [[New Amsterdam]] and parts of the Hudson Valley, establishing the multicultural colony of [[New Netherland]], a center of trade and immigration. [[Kingdom of England|England]] seized the colony from the Dutch in 1664. During the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783), a group of colonists of the [[Province of New York]] attempted to take control of the British colony and eventually succeeded in establishing independence. In the 19th century, New York's development of the interior, beginning with the [[Erie Canal]], gave it incomparable advantages over other regions of the east coast and built its political and cultural ascendancy.<ref name=Roberts>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/nyregion/history-of-the-erie-canal.html|title=200 Years Ago, Erie Canal Got Its Start as Just a 'Ditch' |first=Sam|last=Roberts|date=June 26, 2017 |work=The New York Times|access-date=July 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nMany landmarks in New York are well known, including four of the world's ten most-visited tourist attractions in 2013: [[Times Square]], [[Central Park]], [[Niagara Falls]], and [[Grand Central Terminal]].<ref name=\"Ann Shields\">{{cite web|title=The World's 50 Most Visited Tourist Attractions\u2014No. 3: Times Square, New York City\u2014Annual Visitors: 50,000,000\n |author=Ann Shields|publisher=Travel+Lesiure|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/slideshows/worlds-most-visited-tourist-attractions/5\n |date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=July 17, 2015\n |quote=No.{{nbsp}}3 Times Square, New York City\u2014Annual Visitors: 50,000,000{{nbsp}}...

Trying to corner trade with the Europeans, they targeted other tribes. The Mohawk were also known for refusing white settlement on their land and banishing any of their people who converted to Christianity. They posed a major threat to the Abenaki and Mohicans, while the Susquehannock briefly conquered the Lenape in the 1600s. The most devastating event of the century, however, was the [[Beaver Wars]]. From approximately 1640\u20131680, Iroquoian peoples waged campaigns which extended from modern-day Michigan to Virginia against Algonquian and Siouan tribes, as well as each other. The aim was to control more land for animal trapping, a career most natives had turned to in hopes of trading with whites first. This completely changed the ethnography of the region, and most large game was hunted out before whites ever fully explored the land. Still, afterward, the Iroquois Confederacy offered shelter to refugees of the [[Mascouten]], Erie, [[Neutral Nation|Chonnonton]], [[Tutelo]], [[Saponi]], and [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] nations. In the 1700s, they would also merge with the Mohawk during the [[French-Indian War]] and take in the remaining Susquehannock of Pennsylvania after they were decimated in war.<ref>Editor: Alvin M.

Then, after the Revolution, a large group of them split off and returned to Ohio, becoming known as the [[Mingo]] Seneca. The current six tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy are the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Tuscarora and Mohawk.

The success of the [[patroon]]ship of [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|Rensselaerswyck]] (1630), which surrounded Albany and lasted until the mid-19th century, was also a key factor in the early success of the colony. The English captured the colony during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] and governed it as the [[Province of New York]].

The [[Stamp Act Congress]] met in the city on October 19 of that year, composed of representatives from across the [[Thirteen Colonies]] who set the stage for the [[Continental Congress]] to follow.

This included the right to [[No taxation without representation|representative government]]. At the same time, given strong commercial, personal and sentimental links to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], many New York residents were [[Loyalist]]s.

It was not submitted to the people for ratification. On July 30, 1777, [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] was inaugurated as the first [[Governor of New York]] at Kingston.\n\nAbout a third of the battles of the [[American Revolutionary War]] took place in New York; the first major one (and largest of the entire war) was the [[Battle of Long Island]], a.k.a. ''Battle of Brooklyn'', in August 1776. After their victory, the British occupied New York City, making it their military and political base of operations in North America for the duration of the conflict, and consequently the focus of General [[George Washington]]'s [[Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War|intelligence network]]. On the notorious British [[HMS Jersey (1736)|prison ships]] of [[Wallabout Bay]], more American combatants died of intentional neglect than were killed in combat in every battle of the war combined. Both sides of combatants lost more soldiers to disease than to outright wounds. The first of two major British armies were captured by the [[Continental Army]] at the [[Battles of Saratoga|Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777, a success that influenced [[France]] to ally with the revolutionaries.The state constitution was enacted in 1777. New York became the 11th state to ratify the [[United States Constitution]], on July 26, 1788.\n[[File:Surrender of General Burgoyne.jpg|thumb|left|British general [[John Burgoyne]] surrenders at [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]] in 1777|alt=A painting of British general John Burgoyne and his men surrendering at Saratoga, 1777.]]\n\nIn an attempt to retain their [[sovereign nation|sovereignty]] and remain an independent nation positioned between the new United States and British North America, four of the [[Iroquois|Iroquois Nations]] fought on the side of the British; only the [[Oneida people|Oneida]] and their dependents, the Tuscarora, allied themselves with the Americans.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Divided Ground: Indians, Settlers, and the Northern Borderland of the American Revolution|url=https://archive.org/details/dividedgroundind0000tayl|url-access=registration|author=Alan Taylor|publisher=Knopf|isbn=978-0-679-45471-7|year=2006}}</ref> In retaliation for attacks on the frontier led by [[Joseph Brant]] and Loyalist [[Mohawk people|Mohawk forces]], the [[Sullivan Expedition]] of 1779 destroyed nearly 50 Iroquois villages, adjacent croplands and winter stores, forcing many refugees to British-held Niagara.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sullivan/Clinton Interactive Map Set |url=http://www.sullivanclinton.com/mapset/shell.swf |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAs allies of the British, the Iroquois were forced out of New York, although they had not been part of treaty negotiations.

In the United States, the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] did not assume direct jurisdiction for immigration until 1890. Prior to this time, the matter was delegated to the individual states, then via contract between the states and the federal government. Most immigrants to New York would disembark at the bustling docks along the Hudson and [[East River]]s, in the eventual [[Lower Manhattan]]. On May 4, 1847, the [[New York State Legislature]] created the Board of Commissioners of Immigration to regulate immigration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/elis/castle_garden.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110063703/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/elis/castle_garden.pdf|archivedate=November 10, 2013 |title=Castle Garden as An Immigrant Depot:1855\u20131890 |publisher=National Park Service|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe first permanent immigration depot in New York was established in 1855 at [[Castle Clinton|Castle Garden]], a converted [[War of 1812]] era fort located within what is now [[Battery Park]], at the tip of Lower Manhattan. The first immigrants to arrive at the new depot were aboard three ships that had just been released from [[quarantine]]. Castle Garden served as New York's immigrant depot until it closed on April 18, 1890, when the federal government assumed control over immigration. During that period, more than eight million immigrants passed through its doors (two of every three U.S. immigrants).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/cacl/index.htm |title=Castle Clinton |publisher=National Park Service|date=August 22, 2013 |accessdate=September 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhen the federal government assumed control, it established the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|Bureau of Immigration]], which chose the three-acre Ellis Island in [[Upper New York Bay|Upper New York Harbor]] for an entry depot. Already federally controlled, the island had served as an ammunition depot. It was chosen due its relative isolation with proximity to New York City and the rail lines of [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], via a short ferry ride. While the island was being developed and expanded via [[land reclamation]], the federal government operated a temporary depot at the Barge Office at the Battery.<ref>Vincent J. Cannato: ''American Passage: The History of Ellis Island''. p.50: Harper Collins (2009) {{ISBN|0060742739}}</ref>\n\nEllis Island opened on January 1, 1892, and operated as a central immigration center until the [[Immigration Act of 1924|National Origins Act]] was passed in 1924, reducing immigration. After that date, the only immigrants to pass through were [[displaced persons]] or war [[refugees]]. The island ceased all immigration processing on November 12, 1954, when the last person detained on the island, [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] seaman Arne Peterssen, was released. He had overstayed his shore leave and left on the 10:15&nbsp;a.m. Manhattan-bound ferry to return to his ship.\n\nMore than twelve million immigrants passed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954. More than a hundred million Americans across the United States can trace their [[ancestry]] to these immigrants.\n\nEllis Island was the subject of a contentious and long-running border and jurisdictional dispute between New York State and the State of New Jersey, as both claimed it. The issue was settled in 1998 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] which ruled that the original {{convert|3.3|acre|adj=on}} island was New York State territory and that the balance of the {{convert|27.5|acres|0|abbr=on}} added after 1834 by landfill was in New Jersey.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/27/nyregion/ellis-island-verdict-ruling-high-court-gives-new-jersey-most-ellis-island.html|title=The Ellis Island Verdict: The Ruling|author=Linda Greenhouse|date=May 27, 1998|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 5, 2013}}</ref> The island was added to the [[National Park Service]] system in May 1965 by President [[Lyndon B.

The Delaware River Basin Compact, signed in 1961 by New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, [[Delaware]], and the federal government, regulates the utilization of water of the Delaware system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nj.gov/drbc/library/documents/compact.pdf|title=Delaware River Basin Commission|publisher=The State of New Jersey|accessdate=April 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n\n{{Main|Climate of New York}}\n[[File:LakeEffectSnowBuffalo101206.gif|thumb|[[Lake-effect snow]] is a major contributor to heavy snowfall totals in [[western New York]], including the [[Tug Hill]] region.]]\n\nIn general, New York has a [[humid continental climate]], though under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], New York City has a [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref name=NYClimate>{{cite web|url=http://nysc.eas.cornell.edu/climate_of_ny.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412104922/http://nysc.eas.cornell.edu/climate_of_ny.html|archivedate=April 12, 2008|title=Climate of New York|publisher=New York State Climate Office\u2014Cornell University|accessdate=April 10, 2008}}</ref> Weather in New York is heavily influenced by two continental air masses: a warm, humid one from the southwest and a cold, dry one from the northwest.\n\nDownstate New York, comprising New York City, Long Island, and lower portions of the Hudson Valley, has rather warm summers with some periods of high humidity and cold, damp winters which are relatively mild compared to temperatures in Upstate New York due to downstate region's lower elevation, proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, and relatively lower [[latitude]]. Upstate New York experiences warm summers, marred by only occasional, brief intervals of sultry conditions, with long and cold winters. Western New York, particularly the Tug Hill region, receives heavy [[lake-effect snow]]s, especially during the earlier portions of winter, before the surface of Lake Ontario itself is covered by ice. The summer climate is cool in the Adirondacks, Catskills, and at higher elevations of the Southern Tier.\n\nSummer daytime temperatures usually range from the upper 70s to mid-80s \u00b0F (25 to 29&nbsp;\u00b0C), over much of the state. In the majority of winter seasons, a temperature of {{convert|-13|F|C|0}} or lower can be expected in the northern highlands (Northern Plateau) and {{convert|5|F|C|0}} or colder in the southwestern and east-central highlands of the Southern Tier.\n\nNew York ranks 46th among the 50 states in the amount of [[greenhouse gas]]es generated per person. This relative [[efficient energy use|efficient energy usage]] is primarily due to the dense, compact settlement in the New York City metropolitan area, and the state population's high rate of [[Public transport|mass transit]] use in this area and between major cities.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Breath of Fresh New York Air|author=The New York Post|date=June 3, 2007|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/06032007/news/regionalnews/a_breath_of_fresh_n_y__air_regionalnews_.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606103459/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06032007/news/regionalnews/a_breath_of_fresh_n_y__air_regionalnews_.htm|archivedate=June 6, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2007}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n====Flora====\n\nSome species that can be found in this state are [[american ginseng]], [[Nitellopsis obtusa|starry stonewort]], [[Hydrilla|waterthyme]], water chestnut, [[Toxicodendron radicans|eastern poison ivy]], [[Toxicodendron vernix|poison sumac]], [[Heracleum mantegazzianum|giant hogweed]], [[Heracleum maximum|cow parsnip]] and [[Urtica dioica|common nettle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/275.html|title=Plants\u2014NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov|access-date=December 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Fauna====\n\nThere are more than 20 mammal species, more than 20 bird species, some species of amphibians, and several reptile species.\n\nSpecies of mammals that are part of New York are [[white-footed mouse]], [[North American least shrew|North America least shrew]], [[little brown bat]], [[muskrat]], [[eastern gray squirrel]], [[eastern cottontail]], [[stoat]], [[groundhog]], [[striped skunk]], [[Fisher (animal)|fisher]], [[North American river otter]], [[raccoon]], [[bobcat]], [[coyote]], [[red fox]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[moose]] and [[American black bear]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/administration_pdf/mammals2.pdf|title=Mammals of NYS\u2014Conservationist Centerfold|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=December 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSome species of birds in New Yok are the [[Common pheasant|ring-necked pheasant]], [[northern bobwhite]], [[ruffed grouse]], [[wild turkey]], [[blue jay]], [[eastern bluebird]], [[American robin]] and lack-capped chickadee.

Diesel-powered vehicles with a gross weight rating over 8,500&nbsp;lb that are registered in most Downstate New York counties must get an annual emissions inspection. All vehicles registered in New York State must get an annual safety inspection.\n\nPortions of the transportation system are [[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]], allowing travelers to switch easily from one mode of transportation to another. One of the most notable examples is [[AirTrain JFK]] which allows rail passengers to travel directly to [[airport terminal|terminals]] at [[John F.

It is composed of three branches: [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislative branch|legislative]], and [[judicial branch|judicial]].\n\nThe [[Governor of New York|Governor]] is the State's chief executive and is assisted by the [[Lieutenant Governor of New York|Lieutenant Governor]]. Both are elected on the same ticket. Additional elected officers include the [[New York Attorney General|Attorney General]], and the [[New York State Comptroller|Comptroller]]. The [[Secretary of State of New York|Secretary of State]], formerly an elected officer, is currently appointed by the Governor.\n\nThe [[New York State Legislature]] is [[bicameral]] and consists of the [[New York State Senate]] and the [[New York State Assembly]]. The Assembly consists of 150 members, while the Senate varies in its number of members, currently having 63. The Legislature is empowered to make laws, subject to the Governor's power to [[veto]] a bill. However, the veto may be overridden by the Legislature if there is a [[supermajority|two-thirds majority]] in favor of overriding in each House. The permanent laws of a general nature are [[codification (law)|codified]] in the ''[[Consolidated Laws of New York]]''.\n\nThe highest court of appeal in the [[Judiciary of New York|Unified Court System]] is the [[New York State Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] whereas the primary [[felony]] [[trial court]] is the [[New York County Court|County Court]] (or the [[New York Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in New York City). The Supreme Court also acts as the intermediate appellate court for many cases, and the local courts handle a variety of other matters including [[small claims]], traffic ticket cases, and local [[zoning]] matters, and are the starting point for all criminal cases. The [[New York City courts]] make up the largest local court system.\n\nThe [[administrative divisions of New York|state is divided]] into counties, cities, towns, and villages, all of which are [[municipal corporation]]s with respect to their own governments, as well as various corporate entities that serve single purposes that are also local governments, such as school districts, fire districts, and [[New York state public-benefit corporations]], frequently known as ''authorities'' or ''development corporations''. Each municipal corporation is granted varying [[home rule]] powers as provided by the New York Constitution. The state also has 10 [[Indian reservation]]s. There have been several movements regarding [[Partition and secession in New York|secession from the state of New York]]. Proposals have included a state of [[Long Island]], consisting of everything on the island outside New York City; a state called Niagara, the [[Western New York|western counties]] of New York state; the northern counties of New York state called [[Upstate New York]]; making the city of New York a state; a proposal for a new [[Peconic County]] on eastern Long Island; and for the borough of [[Staten Island]] to secede from New York City.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Capital punishment===\n\n{{Main|Capital punishment in New York}}\n\n[[Capital punishment in the United States|Capital punishment]] was reintroduced in 1995 under the [[George Pataki#Death penalty|Pataki administration]], but the statute was declared unconstitutional in 2004, when the [[New York Court of Appeals]] ruled in ''[[People v.

John Taylor'', and the death row was disestablished in 2008, under executive order from [[David Paterson|Governor Paterson]]. No execution has taken place in New York since 1963.

She is shocked to see the clutch she had lost on the night of Varun's disappearance in the delivery box. She finds a message in the clutch and shows it to Vinnie. They suspect Daljeet is behind the blackmail. Ela screams upon seeing Varun in the mock court. Ela runs out of the mock trial room after seeing Varun there again. She believes that he is alive. Vinnie tells her that it might be a ghost and reminds her of Varun's death. The scene begins when Varun jumps off a mountain on Valentine's night. Vinnie and Ela go in search of him. Varun hangs onto Ela's clutch to climb up the mountain, but they fail to save him. Daljeet talks to someone about his ploy against the girls.\n\nIn class, Sanju, Ela, and Vinnie panic when Professor Anu claims that someone provoked Varun to commit suicide. Ela suspects a connection between Professor Anu and Varun, but Sanju disregards her suspicion. Varun and his sister, Professor Anu, discuss their ploy against the best friends for not saving Varun from the cliff and planting false evidence to mislead the police. Sanju and Ela become scared when there is a power outage at home. Vinnie and the boys surprise them with a party at Sanju's house. Varun sneaks into the washroom and scares Ela. Varun approaches Ela in the dark and confronts her for pushing him off the cliff. Ela and Vinnie argue. Ela receives a taunting message from Varun when everyone plays truth or dare, threatening to reveal the truth to Sanju if she does not confess how she had cheated in the exams. Sanju becomes upset upon learning that Ela had topped the exams by switching the answer papers with her. She tells Vinnie that she can never trust Ela again. She denies forgiving her. Professor Rigved expels Ela for cheating. Varun calls Ela. Vinnie attends the call. He uses a voice changing software to speak to her. He tells Vinnie that he has kept evidence of their crime in Sanju's locker. Ela and Vinnie worry that Sanju will go to the police if she sees the proof. Vinnie goes to the locker room to get the evidence before Sanju sees it. Prithvi tells Sanju that she is the central piece holding their group together. He persuades her to join the gang in the canteen. They understand Sanju's situation and care for her. Sanju asks them not to affect their friendship with Ela because of what happened. Meanwhile, Vinnie and Ela panic when they see sketches of them standing on the cliff on Valentine's night in the envelope. Varun blackmails them and gives them 2 hours to get Rs. 10 lakh. Ela and Vinnie meet the mystery guy, who is Varun, at an isolated location. He records their confession of his murder by tricking them.\n\nVarun asks for more money, asks them to once again meet him on the same cliff. Vinnie steals money from her mother's locker. Varun tries to kill them on the cliff when Sanju enters the scene while searching for Ela and Vinnie. She has seen their video message confessing to her. Sanju defendes her best friends and says to Varun that he is still the bad guy. If he wants to kill them, he should kill her first. Varun hesitates and says he never wanted to kill them. Rather, he just wanted Ela and Vinnie to know how it feels to come near death. He then walks away. The BFF's are happy and head back to Sanju's home. Now, Varun is back in Westwood. Ela and Vinnie are planning Sanju's surprise birthday party. Sanju realizes that she is in love with Prithvi. All of Sanju's friends, as well as her small brother Sunny, also ignore Sanju. They choose Prithvi to bring Sanju to the party. Varun knows that the BFFs are planning something for Sanju's birthday. Varun calls Sanju and asks her to come with him for dinner and celebrate her birthday. Sanju tells Varun that if he comes to her house, she will call the police. As she cuts the call, somebody rings the bell of her house. Sanju thinks it to be Varun and takes a jug full of water as she opens the door. She, not able to distinguish the person, pours the jug forward onto the person revealed to be Prithvi. Prithvi comes inside the house and asks Sanju for her shirt to get it ironed. Prithvi asks Sanju to come with him for a pizza. Sanju goes to her room and gets ready to go. Prithvi takes her to a place which is dark. Sanju, being afraid, was going to leave the place but was stopped by the unexpected arrival of her friends. Somebody is now stalking Sanju and trying to hurt Prithvi. In the meantime, Vinnie's mother finds a boy to get Vinnie engaged. Vinnie's mother tells the name of the boy: Purushashtra. As Vinnie does not want to get engaged, Ela plans how to let that boy go. They invite the boy in a cafe where Ela pretends to be Vinnie. She pretends that Vinnie is an independent girl who has many boyfriends. However, Purushashtra (nicknamed Puru) identifies the real Vineeta Maheshwari. He slyly reminds them that he is also capable of using the internet, telling her the real name of each of her friends. The trustees of the Westwood College arrange a party for Holi for the students. The stalker comes to the party and applies color to Sanju. Prithvi follows the stalker and cuts his hand, but the stalker runs away. Prithvi leaves on the day of the Holi party. Mac also finally breaks up with Ela on the same day, now beginning to avoid Ela. A series of events make Sanju believe that Varun is the stalker, but he denies so.\n\nIn the meantime, Varun and Sanju stand in the election for the president of Westwood College of Law. On the evening of the same day, Vinnie comes to drop Sanju at her house and finds that someone is hiding in the bushes. When they come near the bush, the man tries to run away but is finally caught by them. When the man shows his face, it is Rohan. Sanju thinks the stalker is therefore Rohan. Sanju and Varun make their own teams with three to four people who will help them with sticking posters across the college and writing their speeches. Team members are naturally asked to vote for their respective leader. Sanju comes to know that Puru loves Vinnie. Thus, Sanju plans to tell Vinnie that Puru loves a girl named Chhaya, asking Vinnie to help in setting their love story. After pinning all of their posters across the college, everyone leaves to their respective homes. The next day, they arrive at the college, only to see that the stalker has written a love message on Sanju's posters. Sanju suspects the act to have been carried out by Rohan and tries to find him to no avail. In the evening, while Sanju was going to leave for her house after the day's college work, Ela and Vinnie wait for Sanju in the canteen. As she tries to leave, she finds that someone is following her. Afraid, Sanju tries to run but falls in the corridor. Hearing her screams, Vinnie and Ela come running and find Sanju lying in the corridor. They try to follow the stalker, who falls and gets hurt on his back. In spite of the injury, he rides on a bike and gets away. The scared BFFs go to the police for help. The police, arrest Rohan on the basis of reports from the BFFs, finding that he has gotten hurt on his back. The next day, the Inspector calls Sanju as Varun arrives to post bail for Rohan. Varun tells them the time that Sanju told the police about Rohan was following her, revealing that at that particular time, Rohan was with Varun. On the same day, the BFFs follow Rohan going to an illegal bike racing course. When Sanju asks him why he was following her, he tells her that Prithvi told him to watch her, revealing that he loves Sanju very much. He tells them that Varun knew Rohan was involved in illegal bike racing, so he released Rohan from the jail. Sanju asked him if Prithvi suspected Varun. Rohan answers that Prithvi had, but afterward, Prithvi changed his suspect from Varun to somebody else. When Sanju asks who the new suspect is, a car hits Rohan at a high speed. The BFFs take him to the hospital and call all of their friends, as well as Rohan's parents. After Rohan's operation, all of his friends, except Sanju and Varun, went to their respective homes. Sanju and Varun wait, but Rohan's parents do not arrive.\n\nIn the night, the stalker comes, warning Rohan about telling anything to Sanju. In the morning, Sanju finds many of her previously lost possessions lying on the bench of the girl's locker room. While she surveys the items and photos, an onlooker takes pictures, pinning the images on the school notice board. As a result of the photos, her professors believe her to be a cheater. Ela gets an SMS revealing the truth: that Sanju told Mac to behave ignore Ela. Knowing this, Ela ends her friendship with Sanju. Ela and Vinnie try to find RGV, and Sanju finds that RGV's laptop is lying on the table of a classroom. Sanju tries to make the laptop work but when she comes closer to the laptop, college president voting automatically starts. When she turns back, she sees the professor. Professor Rickved then calls everyone to the assembly hall for voting. After voting, Sanju and Sahil go to have coffee in the canteen. Meanwhile, Rohan calls Sanju and asks her to come to a discreet location if she wants to know the stalker's identity. Rohan waits for Sanju, but a car arrives. Rohan thought that car to be Sanju's, but as he tries to reach forward he finds that it is the stalker. The stalker is revealed as Sahil, and Sahil kill Rohan. When Sanju reaches the location, she finds Rohan hanged and a suicide note that was left by Sahil. Varun helps the police in the investigation. Meanwhile, Anu comes to know that Sahil is the stalker and starts blackmailing him. While checking Rohan's diary, Sanjana is hit in the head by an unknown assailant and dragged to the garden. Vinnie and Puru find her unconscious and take her home. Rohan's dead body goes missing from the morgue. The next day, the police arrest Sanjana for stealing Rohan's body. Sanjana's father bails her out. Ela realizes her mistake and befriends Sanjana once more. The same night, Vinnie's car has some problems. When she opens the ''dikki'', she finds Rohan's body, dumped by Sahil, based on the instructions of Professor Anu in a ploy to prove that Vinnie was also involved in Rohan's murder along with Sanju. Police trace Vinnie's car. Ela and Mac find out that Puru is also missing. Professor Rigved shows Sanju, Ela, and others a video in which a girl dressed up like Vinnie drags Rohan's body and places it in a car's dickey. Vinnie becomes a suspect for the crime, but Varun and Sanju prove Vinnie innocent by showing the entire college Puru and Vinnie's marriage video. Pammy admits that someone gave her the wig and dress to imitate Vinnie. They had told her she would need to do these things to be given an audition in an upcoming production. Later, it is revealed that Vinnie, upon finding Rohan's body in her dickey, fainted, but Puru found her and they fled. According to Varun's instructions, they hand over Rohan's body to his parents. Sanju recollects and realizes that Rohan's autopsy report is within her books. They decide to inform the police. Ela, Pammy, and Vinnie are sent to the shooting area to inspect the area. There, they find a baseball bat with Varun's name written on it. Though Vinnie and Ela start pondering over it, Pammy says Varun is being framed, and they should stand by him. In the meantime, they find someone eavesdropping, and it is none other than the stalker, who once again escapes. Varun gets a call from Megha and, to his utter dismay, Prithvi is in the last stage of his cancer. When Varun breaks this news to Pammy, Professor Anu hears it and texts Sanju, saying that Varun is playing a game with her by concealing information regarding Prithvi's supposedly declining health, only to have Sanju. Sanju is extremely guilty about distrusting Prithvi. She goes home with Ela and Vinnie but then tells them to leave her alone. Varun finds the person who took Pammy's auditions, but when they interrogate them, they realized that he is not the stalker. Sanju's father comes across Sahil in her bedroom. Sanju's friends get a diary from the stalker, which Ela keeps. Sanju gets a letter from Prithvi confessing his love to Sanju. Prithvi asks that Sanju should forgive Varun as he is trying to rectify his mistakes. Sanju and Varun patch up, as Sanju is shown hugging Varun. Once ordered to leave class, she gets out, followed by Varun. They plan to eat dinner together, but Sanju goes for a drive with Sahil when he ardently requests time with her. Sahil insists Sanju to keep driving further, and they eventually reach a place beautifully decorated where Sahil proposes to Sanjana. Mak and Ela are tensed as they did not find Sanju in her room, as she did not return home. Mac finds chewing gum in Sanju's room and notices a nearly identical one stuck inside the stalker's diary. He then realizes that Sahil is the stalker. Soon after, Puru and Vinnie find a laptop in the car which had hit Rohan. Varun then uses it to discover the stalker's hood in Sahil's locker. Sanju realizes that Sahil is the stalker when she switches her phone on as Ela sends a message to her regarding her security. Sanju gets confused and rushes out of the place. She then finds Varun and Pammi on the road. Sanju goes with them. The BFFs hatch a plan to trap Sahil. Sanjana calls Sahil and tells him that she also loves him, telling him to meet her in the college. Sanjana's backside is shown (who is actually Pammy). She asks him why he killed Rohan. Infatuated, he tells her the truth, causing her to then refuse to meet him at the college. Varun comes in the following scene. A fight then takes place between them, in which Sahil shoots Varun twice, causing Varun to fall down. Sanjana comes with a camera, recording the fight in its entierty. Everyone at the crime scene watches as Sahil is arrested by the police. While leaving, he demonstrates that Professor Anu has been blackmailing by dialing her phone from the number he keeps recieveing demands from. Thus, he blames her. At this point, however, everyone ignores him, thinking his words to be an insane outburst. Now, the BFFs set out to find the female blackmailer. Sanju meets Sahil in hospital. As he prepared to reveal the truth about Professor Anu, she enters in the costume of a nurse, forcing Sanjana to leave the room. She injects Sahil with poison and Sahil gets paralyzed. Varun finds Rohan's bag and poison stored in Anu's room. He comes to realize that Anu is the blackmailer. He sends a message to all three girls through Pammy. The next day, everyone determines that Anu killed Rohan and poisoned Sahil. Frustrated, Anu reveals, in front of everyone, that she dumped Rohan's body in Vinnie's car. Sanjana records the entire confession, causing Anu to be arrested. The show takes a leap of 2 weeks (exams are over). Varun, Mac, and Puru cook food for the girls. Puru proposes to Vinnie for marriage. Mac and Ela promise to spend their life together. Sanju tells Varun that she is leaving for [[United States Of America]] and that she will stay with Prithvi for his treatment. She also tells him that Pammy loves him very much.

When she opens the ''dikki'', she finds Rohan's body, dumped by Sahil, based on the instructions of Professor Anu in a ploy to prove that Vinnie was also involved in Rohan's murder along with Sanju. Police trace Vinnie's car. Ela and Mac find out that Puru is also missing. Professor Rigved shows Sanju, Ela, and others a video in which a girl dressed up like Vinnie drags Rohan's body and places it in a car's dickey. Vinnie becomes a suspect for the crime, but Varun and Sanju prove Vinnie innocent by showing the entire college Puru and Vinnie's marriage video. Pammy admits that someone gave her the wig and dress to imitate Vinnie. They had told her she would need to do these things to be given an audition in an upcoming production. Later, it is revealed that Vinnie, upon finding Rohan's body in her dickey, fainted, but Puru found her and they fled. According to Varun's instructions, they hand over Rohan's body to his parents. Sanju recollects and realizes that Rohan's autopsy report is within her books. They decide to inform the police. Ela, Pammy, and Vinnie are sent to the shooting area to inspect the area. There, they find a baseball bat with Varun's name written on it. Though Vinnie and Ela start pondering over it, Pammy says Varun is being framed, and they should stand by him. In the meantime, they find someone eavesdropping, and it is none other than the stalker, who once again escapes. Varun gets a call from Megha and, to his utter dismay, Prithvi is in the last stage of his cancer. When Varun breaks this news to Pammy, Professor Anu hears it and texts Sanju, saying that Varun is playing a game with her by concealing information regarding Prithvi's supposedly declining health, only to have Sanju. Sanju is extremely guilty about distrusting Prithvi. She goes home with Ela and Vinnie but then tells them to leave her alone. Varun finds the person who took Pammy's auditions, but when they interrogate them, they realized that he is not the stalker. Sanju's father comes across Sahil in her bedroom. Sanju's friends get a diary from the stalker, which Ela keeps. Sanju gets a letter from Prithvi confessing his love to Sanju. Prithvi asks that Sanju should forgive Varun as he is trying to rectify his mistakes. Sanju and Varun patch up, as Sanju is shown hugging Varun. Once ordered to leave class, she gets out, followed by Varun. They plan to eat dinner together, but Sanju goes for a drive with Sahil when he ardently requests time with her. Sahil insists Sanju to keep driving further, and they eventually reach a place beautifully decorated where Sahil proposes to Sanjana. Mak and Ela are tensed as they did not find Sanju in her room, as she did not return home. Mac finds chewing gum in Sanju's room and notices a nearly identical one stuck inside the stalker's diary. He then realizes that Sahil is the stalker. Soon after, Puru and Vinnie find a laptop in the car which had hit Rohan. Varun then uses it to discover the stalker's hood in Sahil's locker. Sanju realizes that Sahil is the stalker when she switches her phone on as Ela sends a message to her regarding her security. Sanju gets confused and rushes out of the place. She then finds Varun and Pammi on the road. Sanju goes with them. The BFFs hatch a plan to trap Sahil. Sanjana calls Sahil and tells him that she also loves him, telling him to meet her in the college. Sanjana's backside is shown (who is actually Pammy). She asks him why he killed Rohan. Infatuated, he tells her the truth, causing her to then refuse to meet him at the college. Varun comes in the following scene. A fight then takes place between them, in which Sahil shoots Varun twice, causing Varun to fall down. Sanjana comes with a camera, recording the fight in its entierty. Everyone at the crime scene watches as Sahil is arrested by the police. While leaving, he demonstrates that Professor Anu has been blackmailing by dialing her phone from the number he keeps recieveing demands from. Thus, he blames her. At this point, however, everyone ignores him, thinking his words to be an insane outburst. Now, the BFFs set out to find the female blackmailer. Sanju meets Sahil in hospital. As he prepared to reveal the truth about Professor Anu, she enters in the costume of a nurse, forcing Sanjana to leave the room. She injects Sahil with poison and Sahil gets paralyzed. Varun finds Rohan's bag and poison stored in Anu's room. He comes to realize that Anu is the blackmailer. He sends a message to all three girls through Pammy. The next day, everyone determines that Anu killed Rohan and poisoned Sahil. Frustrated, Anu reveals, in front of everyone, that she dumped Rohan's body in Vinnie's car. Sanjana records the entire confession, causing Anu to be arrested. The show takes a leap of 2 weeks (exams are over). Varun, Mac, and Puru cook food for the girls. Puru proposes to Vinnie for marriage. Mac and Ela promise to spend their life together. Sanju tells Varun that she is leaving for [[United States Of America]] and that she will stay with Prithvi for his treatment. She also tells him that Pammy loves him very much.

The following events happened:\n\n<blockquote>That conversation came back to me as Brian Eastman told me that [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] wanted to make a series of ten one-hour films based on the Poirot short stories. Then he dropped his bombshell: 'We are very keen that you should play Poirot.'<br />My spoonful of curry stopped halfway to my mouth. I was astounded. Me, the serious Shakespearean actor, portrayer of men with haunted souls, playing a fastidious, balding detective?<br />Brian sent me two Poirot novels and I became intrigued. The Poirot in the books was nothing like the character I'd seen on screen: he was more elusive, more pedantic, and most of all, more human. But I still wasn't sure whether I should play him. I called my elder brother John, then a newscaster at ITN, and asked what he thought.<br />'I wouldn't touch it with a barge pole,' John said firmly. 'Poirot's a bit of a joke, a buffoon. It's not you at all.' I gulped.<br />'Well, what I'm reading isn't a buffoon,' I told him. 'It's a character that I've never seen portrayed.'<br />There was a slight sigh. 'Of course, you must do it if you want to,' he said quietly. 'Good luck. Only a word of warning: it may be difficult to get people to take him seriously.'<br />It turned out he was right. Nonetheless, I was convinced that I could bring the true Poirot, as Agatha Christie had written him, to life. I told Brian that I would do it.<ref name=\"Suchet\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2506890/Poirot-finale-My-agony-Poirot-drew-breath-David-Suchet.html |title='My agony as Poirot drew out his last breath', by DAVID SUCHET: Shock as the little Belgian sensationally turns out to be the killer in his own final case (SPOILER) |last=Suchet |first=David |newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]] |date=13 November 2013 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1988, he played [[Leopold Bloom]]<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1308056/combined IMDb profile of ''The Modern World: Ten Great Writers \u2013 James Joyce's 'Ulysses'']</ref> in the [[Channel 4]] documentary ''The Modern World: Ten Great Writers'', in which some of James Joyce's ''Ulysses'' was dramatised.<ref name=Sheehan>{{cite book|last=Sheehan|first=Sean|title=Joyce's Ulysses: A Reader's Guide|year=2009|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1847065193|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u_4CAsagp6sC&lpg=PA101&pg=PA106#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> During the time, he spent days reading Agatha Christie's books about Hercule Poirot:\n\n<blockquote>The more I read, the more the little man entranced me.

During the time the final episode was filmed, Suchet expressed his sadness at his final farewell to the Poirot character he had loved:\n\n<blockquote>This is the death of a dear friend. For years it has been Poirot and me \u2013 and to lose him is a pain almost beyond imagining.<br />Poirot's death was the end of a long journey for me. I had only ever wanted to play Dame Agatha's true Poirot [...] He was as real to me as he had been to her: a great detective, a remarkable man, if, perhaps, just now and then, a little irritating.<br />I think back to Poirot's last words in the scene before he dies. That second 'Cher ami' was for someone other than Hastings. It was for my dear, dear friend Poirot. I was saying goodbye to him as well \u2013 and I felt it with all my heart.<ref name=\"Suchet\"/></blockquote>\n\nSuchet has played the role in adaptations of every novel and short story featuring the character written by Dame [[Agatha Christie]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15726320 BBC profile of Suchet]</ref>\n\nBetween 2014 and 2015, Suchet appeared in and narrated two [[BBC Television]] documentaries, undertaking an epic journey spanning the Mediterranean, inspired by the life and travels of both [[Saint Peter|St. Peter the Disciple]] and [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul the Apostle]].\n\nIn 2016, Suchet took on the role as the narrator in the BBC live production of ''[[Peter Pan Goes Wrong]]'', where he serves as the sole \"professional\" among the cast. At one point during the broadcast, when one of the actors is electrocuted, he is asked to distract the audience. His solution is to take Captain Hook's mustache and start acting like Poirot, even delivering his lines in a Belgian accent. This prompts the director (who is also playing Captain Hook) to retrieve the mustache and dismiss Suchet.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2017/peter-pan-goes-wrong-review-on-bbc1/ | title=Peter Pan Goes Wrong review on BBC1}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Suchet starred as Dr Fagan in the BBC1 adaptation of [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''[[Decline and Fall#In other media|Decline and Fall]]'', and guest starred in the role of a character called \"The Landlord\", for an episode of the [[Doctor Who (series 10)|tenth series]] of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' entitled ''[[Knock Knock (Doctor Who)|Knock Knock]]''.\n\n===Radio===\nHis first broadcast job was to read a \"Morning Story\" for BBC Pebble Mill Talks producer [[David Shute]]; they had met at the Mayor of Stratford's annual cocktail party to welcome members of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] to their new season.

In his book, ''Poirot and Me'', Suchet mentions that Ustinov one day approached him and told him that Suchet could play Poirot and would be good at it. The following events happened:\n\n<blockquote>That conversation came back to me as Brian Eastman told me that [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] wanted to make a series of ten one-hour films based on the Poirot short stories. Then he dropped his bombshell: 'We are very keen that you should play Poirot.'<br />My spoonful of curry stopped halfway to my mouth. I was astounded. Me, the serious Shakespearean actor, portrayer of men with haunted souls, playing a fastidious, balding detective?<br />Brian sent me two Poirot novels and I became intrigued. The Poirot in the books was nothing like the character I'd seen on screen: he was more elusive, more pedantic, and most of all, more human. But I still wasn't sure whether I should play him. I called my elder brother John, then a newscaster at ITN, and asked what he thought.<br />'I wouldn't touch it with a barge pole,' John said firmly. 'Poirot's a bit of a joke, a buffoon. It's not you at all.' I gulped.<br />'Well, what I'm reading isn't a buffoon,' I told him. 'It's a character that I've never seen portrayed.'<br />There was a slight sigh. 'Of course, you must do it if you want to,' he said quietly. 'Good luck. Only a word of warning: it may be difficult to get people to take him seriously.'<br />It turned out he was right. Nonetheless, I was convinced that I could bring the true Poirot, as Agatha Christie had written him, to life. I told Brian that I would do it.<ref name=\"Suchet\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2506890/Poirot-finale-My-agony-Poirot-drew-breath-David-Suchet.html |title='My agony as Poirot drew out his last breath', by DAVID SUCHET: Shock as the little Belgian sensationally turns out to be the killer in his own final case (SPOILER) |last=Suchet |first=David |newspaper=[[The Daily Mail]] |date=13 November 2013 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1988, he played [[Leopold Bloom]]<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1308056/combined IMDb profile of ''The Modern World: Ten Great Writers \u2013 James Joyce's 'Ulysses'']</ref> in the [[Channel 4]] documentary ''The Modern World: Ten Great Writers'', in which some of James Joyce's ''Ulysses'' was dramatised.<ref name=Sheehan>{{cite book|last=Sheehan|first=Sean|title=Joyce's Ulysses: A Reader's Guide|year=2009|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1847065193|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u_4CAsagp6sC&lpg=PA101&pg=PA106#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> During the time, he spent days reading Agatha Christie's books about Hercule Poirot:\n\n<blockquote>The more I read, the more the little man entranced me.

For years it has been Poirot and me \u2013 and to lose him is a pain almost beyond imagining.<br />Poirot's death was the end of a long journey for me. I had only ever wanted to play Dame Agatha's true Poirot [...] He was as real to me as he had been to her: a great detective, a remarkable man, if, perhaps, just now and then, a little irritating.<br />I think back to Poirot's last words in the scene before he dies. That second 'Cher ami' was for someone other than Hastings. It was for my dear, dear friend Poirot.

His solution is to take Captain Hook's mustache and start acting like Poirot, even delivering his lines in a Belgian accent.

Suchet provided the voice of [[Aslan]] in [[Focus on the Family]]'s radio version of [[C.S. Lewis]]'s ''[[Chronicles of Narnia]]''. He performed as the voice of the villainous [[Julius No|Dr. Julius No]] in [[BBC Radio 4]]'s radio adaptation of Ian Fleming's novel ''[[Dr. No (novel)|''Dr. No'']]''. In 1991, Suchet played the part of [[Henrik Ibsen]] alongside [[Martin Shaw]] playing [[August Strindberg]], in a one-off documentary on [[BBC Radio 3]] about the meeting of the two playwrights. {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Canal Trust and River Thames Alliance==\nSuchet is vice-president of the [[Lichfield Canal|Lichfield]] and [[Hatherton Canal|Hatherton]] Canals Trust, whose most challenging achievement to date has been securing funding (both via an appeal and from influencing government decisions) concerning the building of the new [[M6 Toll]] motorway where it cuts the lines of the [[Lichfield Canal]] and the [[Hatherton Canal]], both of which the Trust wishes to see reopened. He was also officially voted in as chairman of the [[River Thames]] Alliance in November 2005.<ref>[http://www.visitthames.co.uk/RTA/ River Thames Alliance]</ref> At the July 2006 Annual General Meeting of the River Thames Alliance, he agreed to continue being chairman for another year.

His performance as Agatha Christie's famous detective [[Hercule Poirot]] in the television series ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot|Poirot]]'' earned him a 1991 [[British Academy Television Award]] (BAFTA) nomination. In preparation for the role he says that he has read every novel and short story and compiled an extensive file on Poirot.<ref name=Dillin-CSM/><ref name=\"Dudley-Yorkshire-2007-04-27\"/> Suchet was given a Variety Club Award in 1994 for best actor for portraying John in [[David Mamet]]'s play ''[[Oleanna (play)|Oleanna]]'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], London. He later won another Variety Club Award (as well as a 2000 Tony nomination for best performance by a leading actor in a play) for his portrayal of [[Antonio Salieri]] in a revival of ''[[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]]''.\n\nSuchet was nominated for another Royal Television Society award in 2002 for his performance as Augustus Melmotte in ''[[The Way We Live Now (2001 TV serial)|The Way We Live Now]]'', which also earned him a BAFTA nomination. The same year, he was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE). On 10 October 2008, Suchet was awarded an honorary degree for his contributions to the Arts, from the [[University of Chichester]]. This was presented by the Vice-Chancellor at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]]. In November 2008 Suchet won an [[International Emmy Award for Best Actor]] at the [[International Emmy Awards]] in New York for his role as tycoon [[Robert Maxwell]] in the 2007 BBC [[television film]], ''[[Maxwell (film)|Maxwell]]''. He said: \"It's been an unbelievable night for the Brits. I'm absolutely thrilled to bits, I can't believe it's really true. This is my first Emmy ever, and I can't tell you what it feels like to win for England because it's international, and to represent my acting community as well.\" {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\nOn 7 January 2009, he was awarded [[Freedom of the City]] of London, at the [[Guildhall]] in London.
