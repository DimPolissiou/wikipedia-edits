During the dramatic years of the [[Algerian War]], he settled in Paris creating figurative sculptures in bronze from 1959 to 1963. They depict scarred, torn organic forms reflecting a reality of cruelty, fear and sexuality. He traveled widely to Italy, Germany, Spain and Yugoslavia, developing a style which was far removed from Danish culture.<ref name=Helleland/> At the end of the 1960s, he often created compositions made up of several smaller sculptures, sometimes using materials such as plastic or textiles, occasionally borrowing elements from other sculptors.<ref name=Helleland/>\n\nAfter an interruption at the end of the 1960s when he turned to films, he returned to sculpture making use of marble, often combining different colours and finishes, as can be seen in his decorative work outside the School of Journalism in Aarhus. Other important works include the geometrical ''Huset der slikker solskin'' (The House which Licks Sunshine, 1980) for the Danish Institute in Rome, ''Dumhedens store flod'' (Stupidity's Great River, 1995) in [[Ribe]], and ''Sorg'' (Sorrow, 1990) for the French University in Istanbul. His later work often consists of large angular shapes with rough surfaces as his three sculptures for the University of Lund (1994) and his 7 meters tall ''Colossus'' at the [[Amager Strandpark|Amager Beach Park]] in Copenhagen.<ref name=\"Weilbach\" /><ref name=\"DSD\">[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Kunstnere,_danske/J%C3%B8rgen_Haugen_S%C3%B8rensen?highlight=j%C3%B8rgen%20haugen%20s%C3%B8rensen \"J\u00f8rgen Haugen S\u00f8rensen\"], ''Den Store Danske''. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 4 June 2012.</ref> \n\nThroughout his career Haugen S\u00f8rensen has been rethinking how to work with sculpture, and according to him art is important precisely because it is the means through which society breathes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.haugensorensen.com/jrgenhaugenssrensenportrtfilm11|title=J\u00f8rgen Haugen S\u00f8rensen - Portr\u00e6tfilm|website=www.haugensorensen.com|language=da|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> His oeuvre can thus largely be viewed as a commentary on basic conditions of human existence.<ref name=Helleland/>\n\n==Style==\n\nSince his debut in 1953 he has without any formal training or schooling shifted between materials and modes of expression within the sculptural sphere.

His reservations about the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts|Academy]]'s approach are evident in his oeuvre's glaring contrast to the generally theoretical approach of his contemporaries. Free of attachment to any given idiom, Haugen S\u00f8rensen channels his creative talents to depicting his own outlook on life, capturing the basic themes of life and death, love and suffering as the focal points of his sculpture, whether working with clay, plaster, fabric, terracotta, bronze, marble or granite.<ref name=\"AKN\">[http://artknowledgenews.com/200707293641/Jorgen_Haugen_Sorensen.html \"J\u00f8rgen Haugen S\u00f8rensen at Statens Museum for Kunst\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921012902/http://artknowledgenews.com/200707293641/Jorgen_Haugen_Sorensen.html |date=2016-09-21 }}, ''ArtKnowledgeNews''.

His scenes of butchery became central to his work.<ref name=Biography>{{Cite web|url=http://www.haugensorensen.com/biografiskoversigt|title=J\u00f8rgen Haugen S\u00f8rensen - Biografisk oversigt|website=www.haugensorensen.com|language=da|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 1950s during a stay on the island of [[Bornholm]], he entered a more abstract phase, experimenting with tiled pipes and other ceramic products, although he maintained elements of the body and other recognizable phenomena. During the dramatic years of the [[Algerian War]], he settled in Paris creating figurative sculptures in bronze from 1959 to 1963. They depict scarred, torn organic forms reflecting a reality of cruelty, fear and sexuality. He traveled widely to Italy, Germany, Spain and Yugoslavia, developing a style which was far removed from Danish culture.<ref name=Helleland/> At the end of the 1960s, he often created compositions made up of several smaller sculptures, sometimes using materials such as plastic or textiles, occasionally borrowing elements from other sculptors.<ref name=Helleland/>\n\nAfter an interruption at the end of the 1960s when he turned to films, he returned to sculpture making use of marble, often combining different colours and finishes, as can be seen in his decorative work outside the School of Journalism in Aarhus. Other important works include the geometrical ''Huset der slikker solskin'' (The House which Licks Sunshine, 1980) for the Danish Institute in Rome, ''Dumhedens store flod'' (Stupidity's Great River, 1995) in [[Ribe]], and ''Sorg'' (Sorrow, 1990) for the French University in Istanbul. His later work often consists of large angular shapes with rough surfaces as his three sculptures for the University of Lund (1994) and his 7 meters tall ''Colossus'' at the [[Amager Strandpark|Amager Beach Park]] in Copenhagen.<ref name=\"Weilbach\" /><ref name=\"DSD\">[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Kunstnere,_danske/J%C3%B8rgen_Haugen_S%C3%B8rensen?highlight=j%C3%B8rgen%20haugen%20s%C3%B8rensen \"J\u00f8rgen Haugen S\u00f8rensen\"], ''Den Store Danske''. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 4 June 2012.</ref> \n\nThroughout his career Haugen S\u00f8rensen has been rethinking how to work with sculpture, and according to him art is important precisely because it is the means through which society breathes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.haugensorensen.com/jrgenhaugenssrensenportrtfilm11|title=J\u00f8rgen Haugen S\u00f8rensen - Portr\u00e6tfilm|website=www.haugensorensen.com|language=da|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref> His oeuvre can thus largely be viewed as a commentary on basic conditions of human existence.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Helleland, Allis.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/180194528|title=J\u00f8rgen Haugen S\u00f8rensen : a biography|date=2007|publisher=Statens Museum for Kunst|others=Bjerkhof, Sven., Statens museum for kunst (Denmark)|isbn=978-87-92023-03-2|location=[Copenhagen, Denmark]|oclc=180194528}}</ref>\n\n==Style==\n\nSince his debut in 1953 he has without any formal training or schooling shifted between materials and modes of expression within the sculptural sphere.

Free of attachment to any given idiom, Haugen S\u00f8rensen channels his creative talents to depicting his own outlook on life, capturing the basic themes of life and death, love and suffering as the focal points of his sculpture, whether working with clay, plaster, fabric, terracotta, bronze, marble or granite.<ref name=\"AKN\">[http://artknowledgenews.com/200707293641/Jorgen_Haugen_Sorensen.html \"J\u00f8rgen Haugen S\u00f8rensen at Statens Museum for Kunst\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921012902/http://artknowledgenews.com/200707293641/Jorgen_Haugen_Sorensen.html |date=2016-09-21 }}, ''ArtKnowledgeNews''.

It runs from [[Sydney]] to [[Albury]], near the [[Victoria, Australia|Victorian]] border. The line passes through the [[Southern Highlands, New South Wales|Southern Highlands]], [[Southern Tablelands]], [[South West Slopes]] and [[Riverina]] regions.\n\n==Description of route==\n{{mapbox|type=line}}\nThe Main Southern Railway commences as an electrified pair of tracks in the [[Sydney metropolitan area]]. Since 1924, the line branches from the [[Main Suburban railway line]] at [[Lidcombe railway station|Lidcombe]] and runs via [[Regents Park railway station|Regents Park]] to [[Cabramatta railway station|Cabramatta]], where it rejoins the original route from [[Granville railway station|Granville]]. The line then heads towards [[Campbelltown railway station|Campbelltown]] and [[Macarthur railway station|Macarthur]], the current limit of [[Railway electrification system|electrification]] and [[Passenger services|suburban passenger services]]. The electrification previously extended to Glenlee colliery, but this was removed following the cessation of electric haulage of freight trains in the 1990s.\n\nThe line continues as a double non-electrified track south through the [[Southern Highlands (New South Wales)|Southern Highlands]] towns of [[Mittagong railway station|Mittagong]] and [[Goulburn railway station|Goulburn]] to [[Junee railway station|Junee]] on the Southern Plains. Here the line becomes single track for the remainder of its journey south to the state border with [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] at [[Albury railway station|Albury]]. The [[North East railway line]] then continues through northern Victoria to [[Southern Cross railway station|Melbourne]].\n\nThe line north of Macarthur is maintained by [[RailCorp]]. South of Macarthur the line is leased to the [[Australian Rail Track Corporation]] until 2064.<ref>[http://www.artc.com.au/library/Final_Tripartite_Agreement.pdf Memorandum between The Commonwealth of Australia & The State of New South Wales & Australian Rail Track Corporation Limited] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411121411/http://www.artc.com.au/library/Final_Tripartite_Agreement.pdf |date=11 April 2013 }} Australian Rail Track Corporation</ref><ref>[http://www.artc.com.au/library/agreement_summary.pdf The Agreement in Summary] Australian Rail Track Corporation</ref>\n\n==Development of the line==\nOn 26 September 1855 the first railway in New South Wales, the [[Main Suburban railway line|Sydney to Granville railway]] opened. Exactly a year later, a branch was opened from what was known as Parramatta Junction (the present day [[Granville railway station|Granville]]) to [[Liverpool railway station, Sydney|Liverpool]]. This line was extended to [[Campbelltown railway station|Campbelltown]] in 1858, [[Picton railway station|Picton]] in 1868, [[Goulburn railway station|Goulburn]] in 1869, [[Yass Junction railway station|Yass Junction]] in 1876, [[Galong railway station|Galong]], [[Harden railway station|Harden-Murrumburrah]] and [[Cootamundra railway station|Cootamundra]] in 1877 and [[Junee railway station|Junee]] and [[Bomen railway station|Bomen]] (on the north bank of the [[Murrumbidgee River]]) in 1878.

From March 1956 a daylight connection was introduced between Sydney and Melbourne whereby a train from Sydney connected at Albury with a train to Melbourne and vice versa. In 1962 the railway south of Albury was converted to standard gauge, allowing through operation of trains between Sydney and Melbourne. Between April 1962 and August 1991, the Main South was served by the ''[[Intercapital Daylight]]'', a locomotive hauled limited stop passenger train. It was operated jointly by the [[New South Wales Government Railways]] and the [[Victorian Railways]] with the former's [[New South Wales RUB type carriage stock|air-conditioned rolling stock]]. Two overnight services also ran, the limited stops ''[[Southern Aurora]]'' and the ''[[Spirit of Progress]]''. Until 1982 locomotives were exchanged at Albury for a locomotive of the respective state that the train was entering.\n\nThe ''[[South Mail]]'' operated overnight between Sydney and Albury until it ceased in June 1985. In August 1986 the ''Southern Aurora'' and the ''Spirit of Progress'' were merged into the ''[[Sydney/Melbourne Express]]''. In August 1991, [[airline deregulation]] and falling patronage saw the ''Intercapital Daylight'' replaced by a coach service between Melbourne and Albury, connecting with the ''[[Riverina Express|Riverina XPT]]'' at Albury. In November 1993 the delivery of additional [[New South Wales XPT|XPT rollingstock]] saw the introduction of a through overnight XPT service between Sydney and Melbourne, replacing the ''Sydney/Melbourne Express'', and the ''Riverina XPT'' extended to Melbourne from December 1994.<ref>Banger, C.

It runs from [[Sydney]] to [[Albury]], near the [[Victoria, Australia|Victorian]] border. The line passes through the [[Southern Highlands, New South Wales|Southern Highlands]], [[Southern Tablelands]], [[South West Slopes]] and [[Riverina]] regions.\n\n==Description of route==\n{{mapbox|type=line}}\nThe Main Southern Railway commences as an electrified pair of tracks in the [[Sydney metropolitan area]]. Since 1924, the line branches from the [[Main Suburban railway line]] at [[Lidcombe railway station|Lidcombe]] and runs via [[Regents Park railway station|Regents Park]] to [[Cabramatta railway station|Cabramatta]], where it rejoins the original route from [[Granville railway station|Granville]]. The line then heads towards [[Campbelltown railway station|Campbelltown]] and [[Macarthur railway station|Macarthur]], the current limit of [[Railway electrification system|electrification]] and [[Passenger services|suburban passenger services]]. The electrification previously extended to Glenlee colliery, but this was removed following the cessation of electric haulage of freight trains in the 1990s.\n\nThe line continues as a double non-electrified track south through the [[Southern Highlands (New South Wales)|Southern Highlands]] towns of [[Mittagong railway station|Mittagong]] and [[Goulburn railway station|Goulburn]] to [[Junee railway station|Junee]] on the Southern Plains. Here the line becomes single track for the remainder of its journey south to the state border with [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] at [[Albury railway station|Albury]]. The [[North East railway line]] then continues through northern Victoria to [[Southern Cross railway station|Melbourne]].\n\nThe line north of Macarthur is maintained by [[RailCorp]]. South of Macarthur the line is leased to the [[Australian Rail Track Corporation]] until 2064.<ref>[http://www.artc.com.au/library/Final_Tripartite_Agreement.pdf Memorandum between The Commonwealth of Australia & The State of New South Wales & Australian Rail Track Corporation Limited] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411121411/http://www.artc.com.au/library/Final_Tripartite_Agreement.pdf |date=11 April 2013 }} Australian Rail Track Corporation</ref><ref>[http://www.artc.com.au/library/agreement_summary.pdf The Agreement in Summary] Australian Rail Track Corporation</ref>\n\n==Development of the line==\nOn 26 September 1855 the first railway in New South Wales, the [[Main Suburban railway line|Sydney to Granville railway]] opened.

From March 1956 a daylight connection was introduced between Sydney and Melbourne whereby a train from Sydney connected at Albury with a train to Melbourne and vice versa. In 1962 the railway south of Albury was converted to standard gauge, allowing through operation of trains between Sydney and Melbourne. Between April 1962 and August 1991, the Main South was served by the ''[[Intercapital Daylight]]'', a locomotive hauled limited stop passenger train. It was operated jointly by the [[New South Wales Government Railways]] and the [[Victorian Railways]] with the former's [[New South Wales RUB type carriage stock|air-conditioned rolling stock]]. Two overnight services also ran, the limited stops ''[[Southern Aurora]]'' and the ''[[Spirit of Progress]]''. Until 1982 locomotives were exchanged at Albury for a locomotive of the respective state that the train was entering.\n\nThe ''[[South Mail]]'' operated overnight between Sydney and Albury until it ceased in June 1985. In August 1986 the ''Southern Aurora'' and the ''Spirit of Progress'' were merged into the ''[[Sydney/Melbourne Express]]''. In August 1991, [[airline deregulation]] and falling patronage saw the ''Intercapital Daylight'' replaced by a coach service between Melbourne and Albury, connecting with the ''[[Riverina Express|Riverina XPT]]'' at Albury. In November 1993 the delivery of additional [[New South Wales XPT|XPT rollingstock]] saw the introduction of a through overnight XPT service between Sydney and Melbourne, replacing the ''Sydney/Melbourne Express'', and the ''Riverina XPT'' extended to Melbourne from December 1994.<ref>Banger, C.
