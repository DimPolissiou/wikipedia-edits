Imelda is the sixth of Vicente's eleven children, and Remedios's firstborn.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1969|page=61}}\n\nBorn into the Romu\u00e1ldez political dynasty from the [[Leyte|province of Leyte]], Imelda grew up in a wealthy clan of ''cat\u00f3licos cerrados'' (literally, \"Closed Catholics\"), a local term for strict and devout [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Latin-Rite Catholics]].{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}} For Imelda's birth, her father hired two physicians and reserved a suite at an extravagant rate of 25 [[Philippine peso|pesos]] per day.

The old wooden structure of the school still stands today four blocks away from the Romualdez house. At school, Imelda had to face the fact of her family's humiliating poverty. She was frequently among the students who had to apologize for late payments.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=54}}\n\n==== High school ====\nIn 1942, the Romualdezes returned to [[Tacloban]], and around that time, Imelda's father refused to let her go back to school.{{sfn|Polotan|1970|p=54}} When the Americans came, she lined up with a hundred other young girls in wooden clogs at the [[Leyte Progressive High School|Leyte High School]], eager to resume her studies. The year was 1944. She finished first year at the provincial high school where she was also chosen Miss I-A; then in her second year, she moved to Holy Infant and stayed there until she graduated.{{sfn|Polotan|1970|p=56}}\n\nImelda continued her higher studies at Holy Infant Academy from 1938 to 1948, the year she graduated from high school.

She was put up as candidate for the Department of Education, which had an enrollment of 800 students. Even during the nomination, her victory was already a foregone conclusion, but the school authorities insisted that another candidate be put up to make the elections a democratic procedure.

Imelda's status in the house of Romualdez during this time has been described as \"higher than servants and lower than family members as a poor relative\". Imelda found work as a salesgirl in a store called P. E.

They were able to use her by attracting normal folk from their daily activities to attend a Marcos rally to see the \"beautiful wife of Marcos\" themselves. The mere mention of Imelda attending a rally would make people attend the rally and scamper for a place near the stage, not to listen to the speeches, but rather just to see the lovely wife of Ferdinand Marcos.

One reason Marcos married Imelda, aside from her physical charms, was because she was a Romualdez\u2014an aristocrat. Imelda's beauty, as well as her background, was appreciated to a great extent by Marcos and Marcos believed she would not only add light to his daily life but also to his political career.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nImelda, coming from a family who practiced a simple lifestyle, had initial difficulties adjusting to her husband's extravagant lifestyle. She once complained that she was only earning a hundred and twenty pesos a month despite her hard labor. To this, Marcos laughed and said that it was her fault that she was working hard only for such an amount. This was a turning point for Imelda to no longer feel guilty about spending money. From then on, she pushed herself to extreme luxury.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=88}}\n\nImelda was expected to be sophisticated, elegant, and well versed by her husband. Marcos knew that having a supportive wife, a trophy that he could be proud of, would gain him more supporters as well as votes. Imelda began dressing herself with expensive clothes and made every effort to become the person whom her husband wanted her to be.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=90}}\n\nIn her efforts to be the perfect wife, she was often criticised for trying too hard, but at the same time, she became a subject of envy for fellow politicians' wives. Imelda learned how to get people's attention and to focus it on both her and her husband. She reached out to every single person who was seen as essential in Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood their concerns, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=97}}\n\nNot only was Imelda good with people, she was also a skilled mediator who mended broken relationships that occurred with Marcos. During Marcos's presidency in the [[Nacionalista Party]], [[Fernando Lopez]], back then Marcos's vice presidential running mate, was unwilling to continue his political career. Marcos asked Imelda to help him mend ties with Lopez, and Imelda burst into tears in order to convince Lopez that he should run as the Nacionalista vice presidential candidate.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=101}}\n\nBy the time Marcos was campaigning to become President, Imelda's influence in Marcos's political career was crucial. Her husband may have been a good tactician, but it was Imelda's determination and popularity that ensured votes for him. Marcos heavily relied on Imelda, and as time passed, Imelda was no longer a clone of Marcos. Instead, she had become his political partner.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=103}}\n\n=== The 1965 Inauguration ===\n[[File:Imelda Marcos at the Bataan Death March Memorial Plaque.jpg|thumb|309x309px|Imelda Marcos at the Bataan Death March Memorial]]\nFerdinand Marcos was [[1965 Philippine presidential election|elected]] as the [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|10th]] President of the Philippines on 9 November 1965.{{sfn|Ellison|1988|p=7\u201310}} When he was inaugurated on 30 December 1965, Imelda officially became the First Lady.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe Romualdez clan had been torn apart by the presidential campaign.

It was also at this time that Dr. Daniel Vasquez and Maria Luisa opened a [[Citibank]] account. In November 1968, the couple added Fernanda Vazquez as a joint holder of the bank account.

Leavold at the time had sold the 2007 rough cut of his documentary [[The Search for Weng Weng|''The Search for Weng Weng'']] about [[Weng Weng]], the Philippines first international celebrity and the shortest leading man in film history who happens to be a remarkable [[stunt performer]] and [[Martial arts|martial artist]]. The film was turned into another documentary about the films made during the time of the Weng Weng's height called [[Machete Maidens Unleashed!|''Machete Maidens Unleashed!'']] (2010) directed by [[Mark Hartley]]. When Leavold interviewed Imelda Marcos for this new project, she was in complete denial about these films. Eventually, Leavold decided to asked her about Weng Weng. Marcos taken aback for an instant eventually said kind words about the actor as an extraordinary and accomplished person who overcame his disabilities. Additionally, Marcos invited Leavold to her birthday and an additional day at [[Ferdinand Marcos]]' resting place. The footage Leavold gathered with her allowed him to convince the production house who had originally bought ''The Search for Weng Weng'' to relaunch the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/09/23/19/the-anc-brief-no-country-an-island|title=The ANC Brief: No country an island|last=News|first=ABS-CBN|website=ABS-CBN News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/2019/10/05/opinion/columnists/newly-discovered-bonifacio-movie/626513/|title=Newly discovered Bonifacio movie|website=The Manila Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/you-me-and-imelda-brisbane-filmmakers-unexpected-philippines-adventure-20120831-255or.html|title=You, me and Imelda: Brisbane filmmakers' unexpected Philippines adventure|last=Nancarrow|first=Dan|date=2012-08-31|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/in-search-of-weng-weng-the-pint-sized-james-bond-of-filipino-film-20140805-100lbw.html|title=In search of Weng Weng, the pint-sized James Bond of Filipino film|last=Wilson|first=Jake|date=2014-08-07|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref><ref name=\":02\">{{cite AV media|title=''The Search for Weng Weng''|date=|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|type=DVD|language=English|publisher=Wild Eye Releasing|location=USA|id=760137943594|}}</ref>\n\n''The Search for Weng Weng'' was completed in 2013, was well received, played in the festival circuits, and in some countries had a limited theatrical release is some countries.<ref>{{Citation|title=Machete Maidens Unleashed!

One reason Marcos married Imelda, aside from her physical charms, was because she was a Romualdez\u2014an aristocrat. Imelda's beauty, as well as her background, was appreciated to a great extent by Marcos and Marcos believed she would not only add light to his daily life but also to his political career.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nImelda, coming from a family who practiced a simple lifestyle, had initial difficulties adjusting to her husband's extravagant lifestyle. She once complained that she was only earning a hundred and twenty pesos a month despite her hard labor. To this, Marcos laughed and said that it was her fault that she was working hard only for such an amount. This was a turning point for Imelda to no longer feel guilty about spending money. From then on, she pushed herself to extreme luxury.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=88}}\n\nImelda was expected to be sophisticated, elegant, and well versed by her husband. Marcos knew that having a supportive wife, a trophy that he could be proud of, would gain him more supporters as well as votes. Imelda began dressing herself with expensive clothes and made every effort to become the person whom her husband wanted her to be.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=90}}\n\nIn her efforts to be the perfect wife, she was often criticised for trying too hard, but at the same time, she became a subject of envy for fellow politicians' wives. Imelda learned how to get people's attention and to focus it on both her and her husband. She reached out to every single person who was seen as essential in Marcos's campaign. Her efforts were not original, but extraordinary. No other politicians' wives shook hands with all the delegates, visited their homes, genuinely understood their concerns, aside from Imelda. She bombarded them with gifts when necessary.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=97}}\n\nNot only was Imelda good with people, she was also a skilled mediator who mended broken relationships that occurred with Marcos. During Marcos's presidency in the [[Nacionalista Party]], [[Fernando Lopez]], back then Marcos's vice presidential running mate, was unwilling to continue his political career. Marcos asked Imelda to help him mend ties with Lopez, and Imelda burst into tears in order to convince Lopez that he should run as the Nacionalista vice presidential candidate.{{sfn|Pedrosa|1987b|p=101}}\n\nBy the time Marcos was campaigning to become President, Imelda's influence in Marcos's political career was crucial. Her husband may have been a good tactician, but it was Imelda's determination and popularity that ensured votes for him. Marcos heavily relied on Imelda, and as time passed, Imelda was no longer a clone of Marcos.

Leavold at the time had sold the 2007 rough cut of his documentary [[The Search for Weng Weng|''The Search for Weng Weng'']] about [[Weng Weng]], the Philippines first international celebrity and the shortest leading man in film history who happens to be a remarkable [[stunt performer]] and [[Martial arts|martial artist]]. The film was turned into another documentary about the films made during the time of the Weng Weng's height called [[Machete Maidens Unleashed!|''Machete Maidens Unleashed!'']] (2010) directed by [[Mark Hartley]]. When Leavold interviewed Imelda Marcos for this new project, she was in complete denial about these films. Eventually, Leavold decided to asked her about Weng Weng. Marcos taken aback for an instant eventually said kind words about the actor as an extraordinary and accomplished person who overcame his disabilities. Additionally, Marcos invited Leavold to her birthday and an additional day at [[Ferdinand Marcos]]' resting place. The footage Leavold gathered with her allowed him to convince the production house who had originally bought ''The Search for Weng Weng'' to relaunch the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/09/23/19/the-anc-brief-no-country-an-island|title=The ANC Brief: No country an island|last=News|first=ABS-CBN|website=ABS-CBN News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/2019/10/05/opinion/columnists/newly-discovered-bonifacio-movie/626513/|title=Newly discovered Bonifacio movie|website=The Manila Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/you-me-and-imelda-brisbane-filmmakers-unexpected-philippines-adventure-20120831-255or.html|title=You, me and Imelda: Brisbane filmmakers' unexpected Philippines adventure|last=Nancarrow|first=Dan|date=2012-08-31|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/in-search-of-weng-weng-the-pint-sized-james-bond-of-filipino-film-20140805-100lbw.html|title=In search of Weng Weng, the pint-sized James Bond of Filipino film|last=Wilson|first=Jake|date=2014-08-07|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref><ref name=\":02\">{{cite AV media|title=''The Search for Weng Weng''|date=|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|type=DVD|language=English|publisher=Wild Eye Releasing|location=USA|id=760137943594|}}</ref>\n\n''The Search for Weng Weng'' was completed in 2013, was well received, played in the festival circuits, and in some countries had a limited theatrical release is some countries.<ref>{{Citation|title=Machete Maidens Unleashed!

Mexico'') is a television program that sets aside the appearance of any competitor, that matters is finding a new voice to the end the program. ''The Voice... Mexico'' tries to find candidates with real vocal skills. And for that, four major music stars, are responsible for finding and training the next great Voice of Mexico. \"<ref name=website>{{cite web | url=http://www.lavozmexico.com/ | title=Official site of The Voice Mexico | accessdate=December 19, 2011| author=Televisa Networks | language=spanish}}</ref>}}\n\nThis program has already become a very famous, because unlike other programs so far, this is divided into three parts and the artist do not have to be locked up almost half a year with teachers in a school.<ref name=website />\n\n== Format ==\n\nThe series consists of three phases: a blind audition, a battle phase, and live performance shows. Four judges/coaches, all noteworthy recording artists, choose teams of contestants through a blind audition process.\n\n=== First Phase \u2013 The Blind Auditions ===\n\nEach judge has the length of the auditioner's performance (about one minute) to decide if he or she wants that singer on his or her team; if two or more judges want the same singer (as happens frequently), the singer has the final choice of coach. Each team of singers (12 per team) is mentored and developed by its respective coach.\n\n=== Second Phase \u2013 The Battle Rounds ===\n\nIn the second stage, called The Battle Rounds, coaches have two of their team members battle against each other directly by singing the same song together, with the coach choosing which team member to advance from each of individual \"Battles\" into the first live round.\n\n=== Third Phase \u2013 The Rescue ===\n\nIn the second season, a new stage was added, in which, coaches can save a member of their team that has been eliminated in the Round of Battles. In this new stage, each coach will select two eliminated contestants; they are assigned a different song and fight. In the end only one of them wins and continues onto the Live Shows.\n\n=== Fourth Phase \u2013 The Live Performance Shows ===\n\nWithin the first live show, the surviving acts from each team again compete head-to-head, with public votes determining one of five acts from each team that will advance to the Final Eight, while the coach chooses which of the remaining three acts comprises the other performer remaining on the team.\n\nIn the final phase, the remaining contestants compete against each other in live broadcasts for the public's vote. The television audience and the coaches have equal say 50/50 in deciding who moves on to the Final 4 phase. With one team member remaining for each coach, the contestants compete against each other in the finale with the outcome decided solely by public vote.\n\n==Coaches==\n\nThe show premiered September 11, 2011 with [[Espinoza Paz]], [[Alejandro Sanz]], [[Lucero (entertainer)|Lucero]], [[Aleks Syntek]] as coaches and [[Mark Tacher]] as host. For season two, [[Jacqueline Bracamontes]] was announced as the replacement of Tacher. [[Jenni Rivera]], [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]], [[Paulina Rubio]], and [[Beto Cuevas]] were announced as the coaches. For the third season, the coaching panel totally changed again. On August 2013, it was announced that [[Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds]], [[Alejandra Guzm\u00e1n]], [[David Bisbal]] and [[Wisin & Yandel]] would be the coaches. For the fourth season, [[Yuri (Mexican singer)|Yuri]], [[Juli\u00f3n \u00c1lvarez]] were announced as coaches alongside Italian singer [[Laura Pausini]] and [[The Voice (Australian TV series)|The Voice Australia]] coach, [[Ricky Martin]]. After a three season absence, Alejandro Sanz returned as coach alongside new coaches, [[Gloria Trevi]], [[J Balvin]], and a duo chair composed of the frontmen of [[Los Tigres del Norte]] for season five. For the sixth season Laura Pausini and Yuri returned after a one-season absence joined by [[Maluma (singer)|Maluma]] and [[Carlos Vives]] which premiered September 7, 2014 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.e-consulta.com/nota/2017-10-12/espectaculos/regresa-la-voz-mexico-con-laura-pausini-yuri-carlos-vives-y-maluma|title=Regresa La Voz M\u00e9xico con Laura Pausini, Yuri, Carlos Vives y Maluma}}</ref>. Maluma had previously coached [[La Voz Kids (Mexican TV series)|the kids version]]. After five seasons as host, Bracamontes was replaced by YouTube figure [[Lele Pons]] for season seven.

[[Belinda Peregrin|Belinda]] was tapped as the first coach, followed by [[Yahir]], and [[Ricardo Montaner]].

On January 21, 2020 it was announced that Belinda and Montaner would return for their second season as coaches, alongside [[Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 (singer)|Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9]] and [[Christian Nodal]] who joined the panel.

Mexico'') is a television program that sets aside the appearance of any competitor, that matters is finding a new voice to the end the program. ''The Voice... Mexico'' tries to find candidates with real vocal skills. And for that, four major music stars, are responsible for finding and training the next great Voice of Mexico. \"<ref name=website>{{cite web | url=http://www.lavozmexico.com/ | title=Official site of The Voice Mexico | accessdate=December 19, 2011| author=Televisa Networks | language=spanish}}</ref>}}\n\nThis program has already become a very famous, because unlike other programs so far, this is divided into three parts and the artist do not have to be locked up almost half a year with teachers in a school.<ref name=website />\n\n== Format ==\n\nThe series consists of three phases: a blind audition, a battle phase, and live performance shows. Four judges/coaches, all noteworthy recording artists, choose teams of contestants through a blind audition process.\n\n=== First Phase \u2013 The Blind Auditions ===\n\nEach judge has the length of the auditioner's performance (about one minute) to decide if he or she wants that singer on his or her team; if two or more judges want the same singer (as happens frequently), the singer has the final choice of coach. Each team of singers (12 per team) is mentored and developed by its respective coach.\n\n=== Second Phase \u2013 The Battle Rounds ===\n\nIn the second stage, called The Battle Rounds, coaches have two of their team members battle against each other directly by singing the same song together, with the coach choosing which team member to advance from each of individual \"Battles\" into the first live round.\n\n=== Third Phase \u2013 The Rescue ===\n\nIn the second season, a new stage was added, in which, coaches can save a member of their team that has been eliminated in the Round of Battles. In this new stage, each coach will select two eliminated contestants; they are assigned a different song and fight. In the end only one of them wins and continues onto the Live Shows.\n\n=== Fourth Phase \u2013 The Live Performance Shows ===\n\nWithin the first live show, the surviving acts from each team again compete head-to-head, with public votes determining one of five acts from each team that will advance to the Final Eight, while the coach chooses which of the remaining three acts comprises the other performer remaining on the team.\n\nIn the final phase, the remaining contestants compete against each other in live broadcasts for the public's vote. The television audience and the coaches have equal say 50/50 in deciding who moves on to the Final 4 phase. With one team member remaining for each coach, the contestants compete against each other in the finale with the outcome decided solely by public vote.\n\n==Coaches==\n\nThe show premiered September 11, 2011 with [[Espinoza Paz]], [[Alejandro Sanz]], [[Lucero (entertainer)|Lucero]], [[Aleks Syntek]] as coaches and [[Mark Tacher]] as host. For season two, [[Jacqueline Bracamontes]] was announced as the replacement of Tacher. [[Jenni Rivera]], [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]], [[Paulina Rubio]], and [[Beto Cuevas]] were announced as the coaches. For the third season, the coaching panel totally changed again. On August 2013, it was announced that [[Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds]], [[Alejandra Guzm\u00e1n]], [[David Bisbal]] and [[Wisin & Yandel]] would be the coaches. For the fourth season, [[Yuri (Mexican singer)|Yuri]], [[Juli\u00f3n \u00c1lvarez]] were announced as coaches alongside Italian singer [[Laura Pausini]] and [[The Voice (Australian TV series)|The Voice Australia]] coach, [[Ricky Martin]]. After a three season absence, Alejandro Sanz returned as coach alongside new coaches, [[Gloria Trevi]], [[J Balvin]], and a duo chair composed of the frontmen of [[Los Tigres del Norte]] for season five. For the sixth season Laura Pausini and Yuri returned after a one-season absence joined by [[Maluma (singer)|Maluma]] and [[Carlos Vives]] which premiered September 7, 2014 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.e-consulta.com/nota/2017-10-12/espectaculos/regresa-la-voz-mexico-con-laura-pausini-yuri-carlos-vives-y-maluma|title=Regresa La Voz M\u00e9xico con Laura Pausini, Yuri, Carlos Vives y Maluma}}</ref>. Maluma had previously coached [[La Voz Kids (Mexican TV series)|the kids version]]. After five seasons as host, Bracamontes was replaced by YouTube figure [[Lele Pons]] for season seven. Maluma was announced to return for his second season with new coaches [[Anitta (singer)|Anitta]] and [[Carlos Rivera]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/mx/news/952801/-anitta-comparte-las-primeras-imagenes-junto-a-maluma-en-la-voz-mexico|title=\u00a1Anitta comparte las primeras im\u00e1genes junto a Maluma en La Voz M\u00e9xico!}}</ref>. [[Natalia Jim\u00e9nez]] former coach of [[La Voz Kids (American TV series)|La Voz Kids USA]] was announced as the fourth and final coach. Season seven was the last season produced by [[Televisa]] after the shows\u2019s rights were acquired by [[TV Azteca]]. Season eight premiered March 13, 2019 on the new channel with [[:es:Jimena Perez|Jimena Per\u00e9z]] as host. [[Belinda Peregrin|Belinda]] was tapped as the first coach, followed by [[Yahir]], and [[Ricardo Montaner]]. [[Lupillo Rivera]], whose sister also served the same role in season two, was later announced as the final coach. On January 21, 2020 it was announced that Belinda and Montaner would return for their second season as coaches, alongside [[Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 (singer)|Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9]] and [[Christian Nodal]] who joined the panel. A month later, [[Eddy Vilard]] and [[Sof\u00eda Arag\u00f3n]] were confirmed as the new hosts replacing Jimena Per\u00e9z.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=800px\n|-\n!Season\n! colspan=\"4\"

He appeared in the wake of the [[French New Wave]] alongside contemporaries like [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]. Demy's films are celebrated for their visual style. Demy's style drew upon diverse sources such as classic Hollywood musicals, the documentary realism of his New Wave colleagues, fairy tales, jazz, Japanese manga, and the opera. His films contain overlapping continuity (i.e., characters cross over from film to film), lush musical scores (typically composed by [[Michel Legrand]]) and motifs like teenage love, labor rights, incest, and the intersection between dreams and reality. He is best known for the two musicals he directed in the mid-1960s: ''[[The Umbrellas of Cherbourg]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Young Girls of Rochefort]]'' (1967).\n\n==Career==\nAfter working with the animator [[Paul Grimault]] and the filmmaker [[Georges Rouquier]], Demy directed ''[[Lola (1961 film)|Lola]]'', his first feature film, in 1961, with [[Anouk Aim\u00e9e]] playing the eponymous cabaret singer. The Demy universe emerges here: Characters burst into song (courtesy of composer and lifelong Demy-collaborator [[Michel Legrand]]); iconic Hollywood imagery is appropriated, as in the opening scene with the man in a white Stetson in the Cadillac; plot is dictated by the director's fascination with fate and stock themes of chance encounters and long-lost love; and the setting, as with many of Demy's films, is the French Atlantic coast of his childhood, specifically the seaport town of Nantes.\n\n''[[La Baie des Anges]]'' (''The Bay of Angels'', 1963), starring [[Jeanne Moreau]], took the theme of fate further, with its story of love at the roulette tables.\n\nDemy is perhaps best known for his original musical ''[[Les Parapluies de Cherbourg]]'' (''[[The Umbrellas of Cherbourg]]'', 1964), with a score by Legrand. The whimsical concept of singing all the dialogue sets the tone for this tragedy of the everyday. The film also sees the emergence of Demy's trademark visual style, shot in saturated supercolour, with every detail\u2014neckties, wallpaper, [[Catherine Deneuve]]'s bleached-blonde hair\u2014selected for visual impact. Roland Cassard, the young man from ''Lola'' ([[Marc Michel]]) reappears here, marrying Deneuve's character. Such reappearances are typical of Demy's work. [[Kurt Vonnegut]] was a huge fan of ''Les Parapluies'', writing in private correspondence: \"I saw ''The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'', which I took very hard. To an unmoored, middle-aged man like myself, it was heart-breaking. That's all right. I like to have my heart broken.\"\n\nDemy's subsequent films never quite captured audience and critical acclaim the way ''Les Parapluies'' did, although he continued to make ambitious and original dramas and musicals. ''[[Les Demoiselles de Rochefort]]'' (1967), another whimsical-yet-melancholic musical, features Deneuve and her sister [[Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac]] as sisters living in the seaside town of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], daughters of [[Danielle Darrieux]]. It was shot in color widescreen [[CinemaScope]] and featured an Oscar-nominated musical score as well as dance appearances by [[Gene Kelly]] and ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'''s [[George Chakiris]].\n\nIn 1968, after [[Columbia Pictures]] gave Demy a lucrative offer to shoot his first film in America, he and his wife, film director [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]], moved to Los Angeles briefly. Demy's movie was a naturalistic drama: 1969's ''[[Model Shop (film)|Model Shop]]''. Lola (Anouk Aim\u00e9e) reappears, her dreams shattered, her life having taken a turn for the worse. Abandoned by her husband Michel for a female gambler named Jackie Demaistre (Jeanne Moreau's character from ''Bay of Angels''), Lola is scrounging to make enough money to return to France and her child by working as a nude model in a backdoor model-shop on the [[Sunset Strip]]. She runs into an aimless, young architect ([[Gary Lockwood]]), who navigates the streets of Los Angeles; like Lola, he is looking for love and meaning in life. ''Model Shop'' is a time capsule of late-1960s Los Angeles and documents the death of the hippie movement, the Vietnam draft, and the ennui and misery that results from broken relationships. This bleakness and decided lack of whimsy\u2014uncharacteristic for Demy\u2014had a large amount to do with ''Model Shop'''s critical and commercial failure.\n\n''[[Peau d'\u00c2ne]]'' (''Donkey Skin'', 1970) was a step in the opposite direction as a visually extravagant musical interpretation of a classic French fairy tale which highlights the tale's incestuous overtones, starring Deneuve, [[Jean Marais]], and [[Delphine Seyrig]]. It was Demy's first foray into the world of fairy tales and historical fantasia, which he explored in ''[[The Pied Piper (1972 film)|The Pied Piper]]'' and ''[[Lady Oscar (film)|Lady Oscar]].''\n\nAlthough none of Demy's subsequent films captured the contemporary success of his earlier work, some have been reappraised: [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] wrote about \"the fascinating application of the operatic technique to an unusually dark story\" in ''[[Une chambre en ville]]'' (''A Room in Town'', 1982).{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} ''[[L'\u00e9v\u00e9nement le plus important depuis que l'homme a march\u00e9 sur la lune]] (1973) (\"[[A Slightly Pregnant Man]]\")'' is a look back at the pressures of [[second-wave feminism]] in France and the fears it elicited in men. ''[[Lady Oscar (film)|Lady Oscar]]'' (1979), based on the Japanese manga series ''[[The Rose of Versailles]]'', has been discussed and analyzed for its [[queer studies|queer]] and political subtext (the title character is born female, her father raises her as a male so she can get ahead in 18th-century French aristocracy, and she eventually falls in love with her surrogate brother, a working-class revolutionary).\n\n''Parapluies de Cherbourg'' has been color-restored twice from original prints by Demy. In 2014, [[The Criterion Collection]] released a boxed set of Demy's \"essential\" work, with hours of supplements, essays, and restored image and sound. The films include ''Lola'', ''Bay of Angels'', ''The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'', ''The Young Girls of Rochefort'', ''Donkey Skin'', and ''Une Chambre en Ville'' as well as most of Demy's early short films.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nAs a student, Demy did not learn any foreign languages. In the 1960s, with the help of some classes, internships, and spending some time in the United States, he learned English. At the time of the Anouchka project, which took many years to complete, he also learned Russian <ref>T\u00e9moignage d'H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Demy dans ''L'Univers de Jacques Demy''.

The two married in 1962. They had a son together, [[Mathieu Demy]] (born 1972), and Demy also adopted Varda\u2019s daughter, [[Rosalie Varda]] (born 1958), whom she had with [[Antoine Bourseiller]] in a previous relationship<ref>Mathilde Blotti\u00e8re, \u201cLes films de Jacques Demy enfin \u00e9dit\u00e9s en DVD\u201d, ''T\u00e9l\u00e9rama'', 15 November 2008.</ref>. Together, Demy and Varda owned a home in Paris and another property with an old mill on the [[Noirmoutier|Noirmoutier Island]] in [[Vend\u00e9e]], where the shots of Demy on a beach in ''[[Jacquot de Nantes]]'' were taken. The film is a version of Demy's autobiographical notebooks, an account of Demy's childhood and his lifelong love of theatre and cinema. Demy appears in the film in the opening and closing sequences and at several points throughout. Varda paid homage to her husband in ''Jacquot de Nantes'' (1991), ''[[The Young Girls Turn 25|Les demoiselles ont eu 25 ans]]'' (1993), and ''L\u2019Univers de Jacques Demy'' (1995).\n\nDemy died on October 27, 1990 at the aged of 59<ref>{{cite book |last=King |first=Homay |date=2015 |title=Virtual Memory: Time-Based Art and the Dream of Digitality |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FdrDCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PT81&pg=PT81#v=onepage&q=jacques%20demy%20aids |location=Durham, North Carolina, United States |publisher=Duke University Press |page= |isbn=082237515X}}</ref>,<ref>Interview, T\u00eatu, November 2008.</ref>.
