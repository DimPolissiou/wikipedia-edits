Big Boss despised his role as figurehead, especially since Zero's vision placed no value on loyalty to ideals and people, something The Boss treasured above all else. When Big Boss learns that his own DNA was being used for Zero's \"Les Enfants Terribles\" project, this proved to be the final straw.

He intends to use MSF to live out The Boss's final will, a world where soldiers are free to choose their own fights on their own terms, and not at the whim of a government. On Colombia's Barranquilla coast, two representatives of the Costa Rican government ([[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Paz|Paz Ortega Andrade]] and [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Zadornov|Ramon G\u00e1lvez Mena]]) seek to hire MSF to liberate Costa Rica from [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Coldman|Coldman]]'s CIA Peace Sentinel unit that has established bases in the country. Snake accepts the mission after G\u00e1lvez hands him an audio cassette with a recording of The Boss's voice. Following Kaz's advice, the MSF takes over an offshore research platform in the Caribbean as their base of operations in a bid to expand the group's capabilities. Over the course of the story, Snake comes to learn about the true purpose of Coldman's [[Metal Gear (weapon)#Peace Walker|Peace Walker]] prototypes (Pupa, Chrysalis, Cocoon, and Peace Walker) and gradually lets go of his guilt for The Boss's death after encountering an AI replica, finally accepting his Big Boss title.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker|year=2010|developer=Kojima Productions|publisher=Konami|quote='''Naked Snake''': I won't make the same choice as her.

After Big Boss killed G\u00e1lvez out of self-defense, Paz pilots ZEKE to launch a nuclear strike on the Eastern Coast of the United States as part of an insurance policy if Big Boss refused to obey [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Cipher|Cipher]]. After hearing the ultimatum, Big Boss refuses and fights ZEKE in order to stop Paz. He is victorious, but ZEKE is heavily damaged and Paz is ejected into the Caribbean Sea. After ZEKE's destruction, Kaz tells Big Boss of being aware of the plot from the beginning, and used it to spur the growth of MSF. Big Boss and Kaz realize they'll no longer be able to be away from the outside world unless they reveal their true nature. Big Boss rejects this idea, stating that his \"life shall be different from The Boss's\". After this conversation, Big Boss gives a speech to the MSF soldiers, telling them that if the times demand it, they will be vigilantes, criminals and terrorists, but they will be the ones to choose their battles and their causes, not governments.\n\nBig Boss plays a central role in ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes]]'' and ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]''. He is on a mission to rescue a [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Chico|child soldier]] and Pacifica Ocean from an American [[black site]] on Cuban soil; Big Boss believes that Pacifica can be converted to MSF's cause. Big Boss's rescue is successful and the medic found a bomb implanted inside Pacifica who is sacrificed to save everyone from another bomb which causes an explosive concussion wave which causes the helicopter to crash into the Caribbean Sea as MSF is destroyed by an [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#XOF|invading paramilitary force]] led by [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Skull Face|Skull Face]]. Big Boss comes out of his coma and poses as \"Ishmael\", a patient in the hospital where [[Venom Snake]] is also being treated, and aids in an escape when the hospital is attacked by Skull Face's forces.

Naked Snake also appears as a playable character in ''[[Super Bomberman R]]''.\n\n==Creation and design==\nIn ''[[Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake]]'', Big Boss's visual appearance was inspired by actor [[Sean Connery]]. But for the ports of the game's re-released version, the original design was replaced by [[Yoji Shinkawa]]'s design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/features/metal-gear-retrospective?pager.offset=2&cId=|publisher=1UP.com|accessdate=February 18, 2012|author=Parish, Jeremy|title=Gear Up!

But with the differences that unlike Solid Snake, Naked Snake was a rookie and thus acted more naive. Shinkawa stated having no difficulties in designing Naked Snake as basically a revised version of Solid Snake. As a result, Naked Snake is virtually identical to Solid Snake from the previous ''Metal Gear Solid'' games in terms of appearance.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://mp.i-revo.jp/user.php/kp-ryan/entry/52.html|title=The KP Report Session 027|publisher=mp.i.revo|work=Kojima Productions Report|author=Payton, Ryan|accessdate=February 17, 2012}}</ref> The love scene between Naked Snake and EVA was inspired by the first ''[[Pink Panther]]''.

The elderly version of Big Boss who appears in the end of ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' is voiced by [[Chikao Otsuka]] (Akio Otsuka's real-life father) in Japanese and by [[Richard Doyle (actor)|Richard Doyle]] in English.

The plan called for two of the first-stage engines to shut down to reduce the rocket's acceleration at approximately 2 minutes 30 seconds into the flight when the Falcon 9 would nominally be {{convert|90|km|mi}} high and traveling at 10 times the speed of sound. The remaining engines were planned to cut off shortly after\u2014an event known as main-engine cutoff (MECO). Five seconds after MECO, the first and second stages separate. Seven seconds later, the second stage's single Merlin vacuum engine was projected to ignite to begin a 6-minute, 14-second burn to put Dragon into [[low-Earth orbit]]. Forty seconds after second-stage ignition, Dragon's protective nose cone, which covers Dragon's berthing mechanism, was planned to be jettisoned. At the 9-minute, 14-second mark after launch, the second-stage engine was scheduled to cut off (SECO). Thirty-five seconds later, Dragon was planned to separate from Falcon 9's second stage and reach its preliminary orbit. The dragon would, per plan, then deploy its solar arrays and open its guidance and navigation control (GNC) bay door which holds the sensors necessary for rendezvous and Dragon's [[Power Data Grapple Fixture|grapple fixture]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 2 (9 October) ===\nThe mission plan called for the Dragon spacecraft to perform a coelliptic burn that would place it in a circular [[coelliptic orbit]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 3 (10 October) ===\nAs Dragon chased the [[International Space Station]], the spacecraft established UHF communication using its COTS Ultra-high-frequency Communication Unit (CUCU). Also, using the crew command panel (CCP) onboard the station, the expedition crew monitored the approach. This ability for the crew to send commands to Dragon is important during the rendezvous and departure phases of the mission.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nDuring the final approach to the station, a go/no-go was performed by [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#FCR 1 (2006-present)|Mission Control Houston]] and the SpaceX team in Hawthorne to allow Dragon to perform another engine burn that brought it {{convert|250|m|ft}} from the station. At this distance, Dragon began using its close-range guidance systems, composed of [[LIDAR]] and thermal imagers. These systems confirmed that Dragon's position and velocity are accurate by comparing the LIDAR image that Dragon receives against Dragon's thermal imagers. The Dragon flight control team in Hawthorne, with assistance from the NASA flight control team at the Johnson Space Center's International Space Station Flight Control Room, commanded the spacecraft to approach the station from its hold position. After another go/no-go was performed by the Houston and Hawthorne teams, Dragon was permitted to enter the Keep-Out Sphere (KOS), an imaginary sphere drawn {{convert|200|m|ft}} around the station that reduces the risk of collision. Dragon proceeded to a position {{convert|30|m|ft}} from the station and was automatically held. Another go/no-go was completed. Then Dragon proceeded to the {{convert|10|m|ft}} position \u2014 the capture point. A final go/no-go was performed, and the Mission Control Houston team notified the crew they were going for the capture of Dragon.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nAt that point, Expedition 33 crewmember [[Akihiko Hoshide]] of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency used the station's {{convert|17.6|m|ft}} robotic arm, known as [[Mobile Servicing System#Canadarm2 |Canadarm2]], reached for and grappled the Dragon spacecraft at 10:56 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/> Hoshide, with the help of Expedition 33 Commander [[Sunita Williams]] of NASA, guided Dragon to the Earth-facing side of the station's [[Harmony module]]. Williams and Hoshide swapped places and Williams gently berthed Dragon to Harmony's [[Common Berthing Mechanism]] at 13:03 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/>\n\nThe opening of the hatch between Dragon and the Harmony module, which was originally not scheduled to occur until 11 October, was moved up and occurred at 17:40 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/>\n\n=== Remainder of mission (11 to 28 October) ===\n[[File:SpX CRS-1 berthed - cropped.jpg|thumb|right|A Dragon as seen from [[Cupola (ISS module)|Cupola]] on 14 October 2012.]]\n\nOver a period of two and a half weeks, the ISS crew unloaded Dragon's payload and reloaded it with cargo for return to Earth.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit -->\n\nAfter its mission at the orbital laboratory was completed, newly arrived Expedition 33 Flight Engineer [[Kevin A. Ford|Kevin Ford]] used the Canadarm2 robotic arm to detach Dragon from Harmony, maneuver it out to the {{convert|15|m|ft}} release point, and release the vehicle. The Dragon then performed a series of three burns to place it on a trajectory away from the station. Approximately six hours after Dragon departed the station, it conducted a deorbit burn, which lasted up to 10 minutes. It takes about 30 minutes for Dragon to reenter in the Earth's atmosphere, allowing it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, about {{convert|450|km|mi}} off the coast of southern California. The Dragon's trunk, which contains its solar arrays, have then be jettisoned.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n[[File:SpX-1 Dragon at port.1.jpg|thumb|left|The SpX-1 capsule seen back at a port on 30 October 2012.]]\n\nThe landing was controlled by automatic firing of its [[Draco (rocket engine family)#Draco|Draco]] thrusters during the [[Atmospheric entry|atmospheric reentry]]. In a carefully timed sequence of events, dual [[drogue parachute]]s deploy at an altitude of {{convert|13700|m|ft}} to stabilize and slow the spacecraft. The full deployment of the drogues triggers the release of the three main parachutes, each {{convert|35|m|ft}} in diameter, at about {{convert|3000|m|ft}}. While the drogues detach from the spacecraft, the main parachutes further slow the spacecraft's descent to approximately {{convert|4.8|to|5.4|m/s|ft/s}}. Even if Dragon were to lose one of its main parachutes, the two remaining chutes would still permit a safe landing. The Dragon capsule is expected to land in the Pacific Ocean, about {{convert|450|km|mi}} off the coast of southern California. SpaceX uses a {{convert|30|m|ft}} boat equipped with an A-frame and an articulating crane, a {{convert|27.3|m|ft}} crew boat for telemetry operations, and two {{convert|7.3|m|ft}} rigid-hull inflatable boats to perform recovery operations. Onboard are approximately a dozen SpaceX engineers and technicians as well as a four-person dive team. Once the Dragon capsule splashed down, the recovery team secured the vehicle and then placed it on deck for the journey back to shore.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nSpaceX technicians opened the side hatch of the vehicle and retrieved the time-critical items. The critical cargo items were placed on a fast-boat for the {{convert|450|km|mi}} trip back to California for eventual return to NASA that then took care of the precious science cargo and handle the post-flight analysis of the samples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight101.com/dragon-crs-1-mission-updates.html|title=Dragon CRS-1 Mission Updates|publisher=SPACEFLIGHT101|accessdate=8 October 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212070813/http://www.spaceflight101.com/dragon-crs-1-mission-updates.html|archivedate=12 February 2013}}</ref> The rest of the cargo was unloaded once the Dragon capsule reached SpaceX's test facility in McGregor, Texas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121028splashdown/|title=Dragon Mission Report &#124; Return of the Dragon: Commercial craft back home|publisher=Spaceflight Now|date=|accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Payload ==\n[[File:CRS SpX-1 Dragon int.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Dragon spacecraft being integrated onto Falcon 9 on 30 September 2012.]]\n\n=== Primary payload ===\nWhen launched the CRS-1 Dragon was filled with about {{convert|1995|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of cargo, {{convert|882|lb|kg|abbr=on}} without packaging.<ref name=Presskit/> Included was {{convert|260|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of crew supplies, {{convert|390|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of critical materials to support the 166 experiments on board the station and 66 new experiments, as well as {{convert|232|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of hardware for the station as well as other miscellaneous items.<ref name=Presskit/>\n\nThe Dragon returned {{convert|1995|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of cargo, {{convert|1673|lb|kg|abbr=on}} without packaging.<ref name=Presskit/> Included was {{convert|163|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of crew supplies, {{convert|866|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of scientific experiments and experiment hardware, {{convert|518|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of space station hardware, {{convert|68|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of [[spacesuit]] equipment and {{convert|55|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of miscellaneous items.<ref name=Presskit/>\n\n=== Secondary payload ===\nFor some months prior to the launch, a {{convert|150|kg|lb|abbr=on}} prototype second-generation [[Orbcomm (satellite)|Orbcomm satellite]] was planned to be launched as a [[secondary payload]] from Falcon 9's second stage.<ref name=\"Orbcomm 25 May 2012\" /><ref name=\"Hartman 23 July 2012\" />\n\nAlthough the secondary payload made it to the Dragon insertion orbit, an engine anomaly on one of the nine engines on the Falcon 9 first stage during the ascent resulted in automatic engine shutdown and a longer first-stage burn on the remaining eight engines to complete orbital insertion while subsequently increasing use of propellant over the nominal mission.\n\nThe primary payload contractor, NASA, requires a greater-than-99% estimated probability that the stage of any secondary payload on a similar orbital inclination to the [[International Space Station]] will reach their orbital altitude goal above the station. Due to the engine failure, the Falcon 9 used more [[Rocket propellant|propellant]] than intended, reducing the success probability estimate to approximately 95%.

NASA agreed to allow that, but only on condition that there be substantial propellant reserves, since the orbit would be close to the space station.  It is important to appreciate that Orbcomm understood from the beginning that the orbit-raising maneuver was tentative.

During flight, the data suggests this material flaw ultimately developed into a breach in the main combustion chamber. This breach released a jet of hot gas and fuel in the direction of the main fuel line causing a secondary leak and ultimately a rapid drop in engine pressure. As a result, the flight computer commanded shutdown of engine 1 and Falcon 9 continued on its path to ensure Dragon's entry into orbit for subsequent rendezvous and berthing with the ISS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aviationweek.com/blog/spacex-engine-anomaly-overview |title=SpaceX: Engine Anomaly Overview |publisher=Aviationweek.com |date= |accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[List of Falcon 9 launches]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist |colwidth=30em |refs=\n\n<ref name=HARTMAN>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |title=International Space Station Program Status |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Presskit\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf |title=SpX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit |date=4 October 2012 |publisher=NASA, SpaceX, 45th Space Wing |accessdate=6 October 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SpaceX Launch Manifest\">\n{{cite web |title=SpaceX Launch Manifest |publisher=SpaceX |url=http://www.spacex.com/launch_manifest.php |accessdate=31 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASA Launch Schedule\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA's Consolidated Launch Schedule |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |accessdate=21 June 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASAsept20\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/spacex-crs1-target.html |title=SpaceX, NASA Target Oct. 7 Launch For Resupply Mission To Space Station |date=20 September 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=26 September 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 18 May 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=18 May 2012 |title=SpaceX's historic commercial mission is 'just a test flight' |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/003/120518commercial/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=ClarkOct28>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121028splashdown/#.UI_fCIa_PKg |title=Return of the Dragon: Commercial craft back home |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=28 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 24 August 2012\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA ready for operational cargo flights by SpaceX |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=24 August 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1208/24cots/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=SPACENOW10>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121010arrival/ |title=Dragon arrives at station with commercial delivery |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=10 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Orbcomm 25 May 2012\">\n{{cite press |title=Orbcomm Eagerly Awaits Launch of New Satellite on Next Falcon 9 |date=25 May 2012 |publisher=Space News |url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/120525-spacex-success-welcome-orbcomm.html |accessdate=28 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hartman 23 July 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |title=International Space Station Program Status |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |accessdate=28 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Sept29\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/09/falcon-9-hot-fires-engines-iss-prepares-dragons-arrival/ |title=Falcon 9 hot fires its engines as the ISS prepares for Dragon's arrival |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=29 September 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AugustChris\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/08/spacex-conduct-successful-wdr-falcon-9/ |title=SpaceX conduct successful WDR on their latest Falcon 9 |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=31 August 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|SpaceX CRS-1}}\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/living/launch/index.html SpaceX CRS-1 NASA page]\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf SpaceX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit (4 October 2012)]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I7loLnDYyU Video of Static Fire test -

The plan called for two of the first-stage engines to shut down to reduce the rocket's acceleration at approximately 2 minutes 30 seconds into the flight when the Falcon 9 would nominally be {{convert|90|km|mi}} high and traveling at 10 times the speed of sound. The remaining engines were planned to cut off shortly after\u2014an event known as main-engine cutoff (MECO). Five seconds after MECO, the first and second stages separate. Seven seconds later, the second stage's single Merlin vacuum engine was projected to ignite to begin a 6-minute, 14-second burn to put Dragon into [[low-Earth orbit]]. Forty seconds after second-stage ignition, Dragon's protective nose cone, which covers Dragon's berthing mechanism, was planned to be jettisoned. At the 9-minute, 14-second mark after launch, the second-stage engine was scheduled to cut off (SECO). Thirty-five seconds later, Dragon was planned to separate from Falcon 9's second stage and reach its preliminary orbit. The dragon would, per plan, then deploy its solar arrays and open its guidance and navigation control (GNC) bay door which holds the sensors necessary for rendezvous and Dragon's [[Power Data Grapple Fixture|grapple fixture]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 2 (9 October) ===\nThe mission plan called for the Dragon spacecraft to perform a coelliptic burn that would place it in a circular [[coelliptic orbit]].<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n=== Flight day 3 (10 October) ===\nAs Dragon chased the [[International Space Station]], the spacecraft established UHF communication using its COTS Ultra-high-frequency Communication Unit (CUCU). Also, using the crew command panel (CCP) onboard the station, the expedition crew monitored the approach. This ability for the crew to send commands to Dragon is important during the rendezvous and departure phases of the mission.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nDuring the final approach to the station, a go/no-go was performed by [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#FCR 1 (2006-present)|Mission Control Houston]] and the SpaceX team in Hawthorne to allow Dragon to perform another engine burn that brought it {{convert|250|m|ft}} from the station. At this distance, Dragon began using its close-range guidance systems, composed of [[LIDAR]] and thermal imagers. These systems confirmed that Dragon's position and velocity are accurate by comparing the LIDAR image that Dragon receives against Dragon's thermal imagers. The Dragon flight control team in Hawthorne, with assistance from the NASA flight control team at the Johnson Space Center's International Space Station Flight Control Room, commanded the spacecraft to approach the station from its hold position. After another go/no-go was performed by the Houston and Hawthorne teams, Dragon was permitted to enter the Keep-Out Sphere (KOS), an imaginary sphere drawn {{convert|200|m|ft}} around the station that reduces the risk of collision. Dragon proceeded to a position {{convert|30|m|ft}} from the station and was automatically held. Another go/no-go was completed. Then Dragon proceeded to the {{convert|10|m|ft}} position \u2014 the capture point. A final go/no-go was performed, and the Mission Control Houston team notified the crew they were going for the capture of Dragon.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\nAt that point, Expedition 33 crewmember [[Akihiko Hoshide]] of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency used the station's {{convert|17.6|m|ft}} robotic arm, known as [[Mobile Servicing System#Canadarm2 |Canadarm2]], reached for and grappled the Dragon spacecraft at 10:56 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/> Hoshide, with the help of Expedition 33 Commander [[Sunita Williams]] of NASA, guided Dragon to the Earth-facing side of the station's [[Harmony module]]. Williams and Hoshide swapped places and Williams gently berthed Dragon to Harmony's [[Common Berthing Mechanism]] at 13:03 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/>\n\nThe opening of the hatch between Dragon and the Harmony module, which was originally not scheduled to occur until 11 October, was moved up and occurred at 17:40 UTC.<ref name=SPACENOW10/>\n\n=== Remainder of mission (11 to 28 October) ===\n[[File:SpX CRS-1 berthed - cropped.jpg|thumb|right|A Dragon as seen from [[Cupola (ISS module)|Cupola]] on 14 October 2012.]]\n\nOver a period of two and a half weeks, the ISS crew unloaded Dragon's payload and reloaded it with cargo for return to Earth.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}}<!-- a source from before the flight does not confirm that the planned event became a past-tense historical fact; needs a better source, or the prose needs to speak to the mission plan as outlined in the presskit -->\n\nAfter its mission at the orbital laboratory was completed, newly arrived Expedition 33 Flight Engineer [[Kevin A. Ford|Kevin Ford]] used the Canadarm2 robotic arm to detach Dragon from Harmony, maneuver it out to the {{convert|15|m|ft}} release point, and release the vehicle. The Dragon then performed a series of three burns to place it on a trajectory away from the station. Approximately six hours after Dragon departed the station, it conducted a deorbit burn, which lasted up to 10 minutes. It takes about 30 minutes for Dragon to reenter in the Earth's atmosphere, allowing it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, about {{convert|450|km|mi}} off the coast of southern California. The Dragon's trunk, which contains its solar arrays, have then be jettisoned.<ref name=\"Presskit\"/>\n\n[[File:SpX-1 Dragon at port.1.jpg|thumb|left|The SpX-1 capsule seen back at a port on 30 October 2012.]]\n\nThe landing was controlled by automatic firing of its [[Draco (rocket engine family)#Draco|Draco]] thrusters during the [[Atmospheric entry|atmospheric reentry]]. In a carefully timed sequence of events, dual [[drogue parachute]]s deploy at an altitude of {{convert|13700|m|ft}} to stabilize and slow the spacecraft. The full deployment of the drogues triggers the release of the three main parachutes, each {{convert|35|m|ft}} in diameter, at about {{convert|3000|m|ft}}. While the drogues detach from the spacecraft, the main parachutes further slow the spacecraft's descent to approximately {{convert|4.8|to|5.4|m/s|ft/s}}. Even if Dragon were to lose one of its main parachutes, the two remaining chutes would still permit a safe landing. The Dragon capsule is expected to land in the Pacific Ocean, about {{convert|450|km|mi}} off the coast of southern California. SpaceX uses a {{convert|30|m|ft}} boat equipped with an A-frame and an articulating crane, a {{convert|27.3|m|ft}} crew boat for telemetry operations, and two {{convert|7.3|m|ft}} rigid-hull inflatable boats to perform recovery operations.

It is important to appreciate that Orbcomm understood from the beginning that the orbit-raising maneuver was tentative.

As a result, the flight computer commanded shutdown of engine 1 and Falcon 9 continued on its path to ensure Dragon's entry into orbit for subsequent rendezvous and berthing with the ISS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aviationweek.com/blog/spacex-engine-anomaly-overview |title=SpaceX: Engine Anomaly Overview |publisher=Aviationweek.com |date= |accessdate=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[List of Falcon 9 launches]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist |colwidth=30em |refs=\n\n<ref name=HARTMAN>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |title=International Space Station Program Status |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Presskit\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf |title=SpX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit |date=4 October 2012 |publisher=NASA, SpaceX, 45th Space Wing |accessdate=6 October 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"SpaceX Launch Manifest\">\n{{cite web |title=SpaceX Launch Manifest |publisher=SpaceX |url=http://www.spacex.com/launch_manifest.php |accessdate=31 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASA Launch Schedule\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA's Consolidated Launch Schedule |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule.html |accessdate=21 June 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASAsept20\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/spacex-crs1-target.html |title=SpaceX, NASA Target Oct. 7 Launch For Resupply Mission To Space Station |date=20 September 2012 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=26 September 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 18 May 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=18 May 2012 |title=SpaceX's historic commercial mission is 'just a test flight' |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/003/120518commercial/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=ClarkOct28>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121028splashdown/#.UI_fCIa_PKg |title=Return of the Dragon: Commercial craft back home |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=28 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=30 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark 24 August 2012\">\n{{cite web |title=NASA ready for operational cargo flights by SpaceX |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=24 August 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1208/24cots/ |accessdate=25 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=SPACENOW10>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/falcon9/004/121010arrival/ |title=Dragon arrives at station with commercial delivery |last=Clark |first=Stephen |date=10 October 2012 |publisher=SpaceFlightNow |accessdate=18 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Orbcomm 25 May 2012\">\n{{cite press |title=Orbcomm Eagerly Awaits Launch of New Satellite on Next Falcon 9 |date=25 May 2012 |publisher=Space News |url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/120525-spacex-success-welcome-orbcomm.html |accessdate=28 May 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hartman 23 July 2012\">\n{{cite web |last=Hartman |first=Dan |date=23 July 2012 |title=International Space Station Program Status |publisher=NASA |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/672214main_1-Hartman_July12_NAC_Final_508.pdf |accessdate=28 August 2012}}\n</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Sept29\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/09/falcon-9-hot-fires-engines-iss-prepares-dragons-arrival/ |title=Falcon 9 hot fires its engines as the ISS prepares for Dragon's arrival |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=29 September 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=29 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AugustChris\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2012/08/spacex-conduct-successful-wdr-falcon-9/ |title=SpaceX conduct successful WDR on their latest Falcon 9 |last=Bergin |first=Chris |date=31 August 2012 |publisher=NASASpaceFlight (not associated with NASA) |accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|SpaceX CRS-1}}\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/living/launch/index.html SpaceX CRS-1 NASA page]\n*[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/694166main_SpaceXCRS-1PressKit.pdf SpaceX CRS-1 Mission Press Kit (4 October 2012)]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I7loLnDYyU Video of Static Fire test -
