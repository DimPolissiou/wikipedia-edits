The two go far back. He was voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]. He was not present for the Big Bang, but Static's clothes still carried some of the gas, and his powers were dormant until Season Three. His power is superhuman intelligence, having invented a number of weapons and devices for Static and himself to use. His superhuman intelligence allows for a very limited form of [[technopathy]] with his visor and Back-Pack, as seen in episode 52 when Richie was no longer able to interpret the data stream in his visor and his backpack was no longer able to sync with his brain, which was at genius level when Back-Pack was programmed.\n\nAccording to series creators, Richie's character was based on [[Rick Stone (DC Comics)|Rick Stone]], Virgil's best friend in the comics, who is gay. However, since his sexual orientation could not be explored within the context of a children's television series, it was not addressed.\n\n===Rubberband Man===\n'''Adam Evans/Rubberband Man''' (voiced by [[Kadeem Hardison]]) \u2013 Adam Evans is a meta-human whose body structure consists of living rubber, which he can shape into a wide variety of forms, even to the point of altering his physical appearance into that of another person. Rubberband Man and his brother Ebon can both stretch themselves which suggests that the effects of the gas may have something to do with the person's genetic code. The name \"''Adam Evans''\" is derived from the names of former [[Milestone Comics|Milestone]] writers [[Maddie Blaustein|Adam Blaustein]] and [[Yves Fezzani]], who created the character. The alias \"Stringer\" Rubberband Man uses in one episode is his real last name of his comic version, first used in ''[[Static (DC Comics)|Static]]'' #34.\n\nAdam is also a talented musician who is on the verge of a professional career. His greatest personal weakness is a [[dyslexia|reading disorder]] which he has to struggle through. He is the younger brother of Static's archenemy, [[#Ebon|Ebon]]. Prior to the [[Big Bang (comics)|Big Bang]], Adam was part of his brother's gang before he took a stock-clerk job at a music store called Stonegas Records. Rubberband Man first appears as a [[tragic villain]] when he goes after an opportunistic record producer who had stolen one of his songs. He subsequently breaks out of prison but deciding not to pursue a criminal career, uses his powers to take up a new identity, \"Stringer\", and becomes a musical rising star. He also starts dating Virgil's sister Sharon, and although he initially clashes with Static, he does not carry on his grudge against him after meeting Sharon and even reforms and becomes one of his allies in crime-fighting. While on patrol, Rubberband Man typically acts as an older brother figure to Static, keeping him from showing off and reminding him of consequences in their work, something that Adam's real brother Ebon never actually did when he looked after Adam prior to the Big Bang. It is unknown if Adam Evans is exposed to the cure for the Big Bang that neutralizes many of the Bang Babies in Dakota at the end of the series.\n===She-Bang===\nShe-Bang, although her real name is Shanice Vale, is a girl with superhuman strength, stamina, agility, reflexes, and endurance. Although she seems like a meta-human she actually was not exposed to the gas; she is really a science project made by her parents, Jonathon and Dolores, who made her [[chromosome]] by [[chromosome]]. They fell in love with her and went into hiding from a group of people who want to clone her, so she had to act like a shy, normal person until she moved to Dakota trying to blend in with the other Bang-Babies. When all the people who were after her were captured, she and her parents moved back to Dakota. She has not been seen since.\n\n===Time-Zone===\n'''Nina Crocker/Time-Zone''' ([[Rachael MacFarlane]]) \u2013 A Bang Baby with the ability to warp time, allowing her to travel into the past; during her time with her abilities, she is one of the strongest and most powerful metahumans on the planet. While looking for Static and Gear, she bumps into Ebon, who wants to use her powers to avoid the cops. After being saved from Ebon, Gear runs tests on her and finds out that she has no control over her powers. Since she wants to become a hero, Gear makes a remote that is linked to a belt around her costume. The remote helps her control her powers. Now named as the superhero Time-Zone, Nina becomes the third member of the Shock Pack, but her time as a member is brief: Due to an encounter with Ebon, Nina decides that her powers are too dangerous to keep, and goes back in time to stop her past self from being present at the night of the [[Big Bang (comics)|Big Bang]] (by stealing her own bike, according to Richie.) Nina is now a happy, ordinary girl, and has no memory of her life in the original timeline as Time-Zone. Time-Zone's powers were based on Flashback's from ''[[Blood Syndicate]]''.\n\n===Anansi the Spider===\n'''[[Anansi]] the Spider''' (voiced by [[Carl Lumbly]]) \u2013 A [[superhero]] native to [[Ghana]], and the greatest hero in [[West Africa]]. Named after the trickster spider of African folklore, Anansi has the power to create visible, realistic [[illusion]]s. In his own words he explains it as: \"''people only see what I want them to see.''\" He also has the ability to cling to surfaces, stand upside-down, and walk on [[vertical direction|vertical]] surfaces. In both his appearances, references to [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Spider-Man]] are subtly made, to which he good-naturedly replies, \"I get that a lot.\"  When Virgil tells him to hit a villain with a \"web blast,\" he replies, \"I'm not ''that'' kind of spider.\" He also seems to inspire Virgil (Static) about what it truly means to be a superhero. In the episode \"Out of Africa,\" Anansi travels to Dakota to stop Osebo, Mmboro, and Onini (three of his enemies, based on the animals that the legendary [[Anansi]] caught to attain his stories,) from obtaining an ancient, golden spider talisman, which is revealed to be the source of Anansi's powers. Sharon mysteriously obtains the artifact, uses it to make all of the dirty dishes \"disappear,\" and takes it for a spin, which leads to her being kidnapped. Static and Gear get drawn in when Sharon is kidnapped. In the end, Static, Gear, and Anansi rescue her, and Anansi reclaims the artifact. The spider artifact was never seen again afterward, as Anansi made sure to hide it.\n\nAnansi's enemies are based on an ancient legend; the story, as told by Anansi, was that a clever Spider wanted to be able to tell stories, and the \"Sky Spirit\" king of all the lands agreed to give the spider what he wanted if he captured three troublemakers: Onini the Python, Osebo the Leopard, and the Mmoboro Hornet. The Spider trapped Mmoboro in a [[gourd]], tied Onini to a stick, and dug a pit and covered it with leaves, then lured Osebo into it. The Sky Spirit thanked the spider and granted its wish, giving it the ability to tell stories through the power of making illusions. Anansi has three enemies: Mmoboro, a giant talking wasp who can turn into a swarm of smaller wasps, Onini, a giant talking black [[Pythonidae|python]], and Osebo, a large man-shaped talking leopard with a metal fist. At first sight, everyone mistakes Osebo for a tiger as he has stripes instead of spots; everyone who has ever heard that his is a leopard wonders why he has stripes. Anansi himself told Static in \"Out of Africa,\" \"I too often wonder about the stripes.\" It is still unknown why Osebo has stripes.\n\n===Soul Power===\n'''Morris Grant/Soul Power''' (voiced by [[Brock Peters]]) \u2013 An elderly [[superhero]] with powers similar to Static's; he now lives in a [[retirement home]], but back in the 1960s, he protected Dakota from criminals. He gained his powers in an accident at [[Hoover Dam]]. He had a [[Batcave]]-like headquarters hidden underground in/near Dakota's [[rapid transit]] system called the Power Pad, and drove a car called the Soulmobile. Back then, he also had a sidekick, Sparky. He, Sparky, and Static team up in order to defeat Soul Power's greatest foe, Professor Menace, who disappeared after a battle with Soul Power in 1963. Soul Power is similar to the [[DC Comics]] superhero [[Black Lightning]].\n\n===Sparky===\n'''Phillip Rollins/Sparky''' (voiced by [[Rodney Saulsberry]]) \u2013 He was Soul Power's sidekick back in the 1970s, but he is now a [[meteorologist]]. Rollins takes on the guise of Sparky one more time in order to help Static and Soul Power fight Professor Menace. His powers were derived from a suit he originally invented and wore so he could be like his idol, Soul Power, and fight alongside him. He too is like Black Lightning and like [[Batman]]'s sidekick, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].\n\n===Hoop Squad===\n'''The Hoop Squad''' heroes Pulverizer, Spindrive, Centerforce, and Pointman are superheroes who work for a secret government. They all have their powers in their super suits and they have secret identities. When they are not fighting crime, they are famous NBA players [[Steve Nash]], [[Yao Ming]], [[Karl Malone]], and [[Tracy McGrady]].\n\n==Other Bang Babies==\n\n===D-Struct===\n'''Derek \"Zee-Bee\" Barnett/D-Struct''' (voiced by [[Bumper Robinson]]) \u2013 A track athlete whose powers generate and envelop him in a shroud composed of compressed [[ion]]ic energy, which can protect him from harm or be directed at targets, but which also gives him the appearance of monstrous [[Doppelg\u00e4nger|apparition]]. Derek is captured by Ebon and coerced into joining the Meta-Breed, (feeling he has no other choice), and is given the name \"D-Struct.\"  Static is able to persuade Derek to quit the gang and return home to his mother. Afterwards, Derek volunteers himself as a subject for Bang Baby research. He is based on a character who appeared in both the Static and ''[[Hardware (comics)|Hardware]]'' comics.\n\n===Dwayne McCall===\n'''Dwayne McCall''' (voiced by [[Blayn Barbosa]]) \u2013 is a pre-teenaged boy who possesses reality-manipulating powers after exposure to Big Bang gas, allowing him to change things into anything else he can clearly imagine, (he has to know what they/it looks, [[Odor|smells]], or [[sound]]s like, etc.). Dwayne is shy, misguided, and doesn't have very many friends, and likes to conjure characters from his favorite comic books, computer games,TV shows and commercials, bringing them to life with his powers. His stepbrother, Aaron Price, finds out about his powers and talks him into getting him free money and other goods from the banks and malls of Dakota. Static eventually discovers what's going on and tells Dwayne to stop listening to his brother. Dwayne does not believe what [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] was saying (and tries to kill him in rage), but [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] plays a tape of himself (as Virgil) and Aaron talking, in which Aaron expresses his dislike of Dwayne. Dwayne, hurt by Aaron's lies, decides to stop using his powers. Virgil's father Robert has worked with Dwayne and found Aaron to be a very bad influence on him, But Virgil knew his father was a better role model for Dwayne. It has been suggested that the character is an homage to [[Dwayne McDuffie]], who co-created the characters out of his imagination, and who (at the time) lived in a different state from the show's producers, and thus communicated with them only by phone.\n\n===Mirage===\n'''Miranda/Mirage''' ([[Gavin Turek]]) \u2013 A young girl with special light manipulation powers, which allows her to generate visible, realistic [[illusion]]s by manipulating [[light]] into anything she imagines or remembers. Her older brother is Byron (aka [[List of villains in Static Shock#Boom|Boom]]), and they live with their grandmother following their parents' death. Their powers came from stepping in a spill of the chemicals from the [[Big Bang (comics)|Big Bang]]. Mirage agrees to help Boom steal money to buy a new place for them to live (only because he is her older brother, a brother-sister relationship where he usually bosses her around), but after talking with Static, she sees how having powers has corrupted her elder brother and helps Static stop him. As Mirage is being taken in by the Dakota City [[Ministry (government department)|Department]] of [[Social Services]], she generates an [[illusion]] of Static flying into the distance, as a favor to Static/Virgil to help convince his sister that he is not Static.\n\n===Permafrost===\n'''Maureen Conner/Permafrost''' ([[Hynden Walch]]) \u2013 Following her mother's death, Maureen Conner became homeless and developed psychiatric problems from the sheer rejection and loneliness. After the [[Big Bang (comics)|Big Bang]], her hair turned white and her skin light blue, and she became an incredibly strong cryokinetic, able to create manipulate and control frost, sleet, flurries, snow and ice, and create massive blizzards, hailstorms, and snowstorms. Around Christmas, Maureen turns to trouble-making, attracting the attention of Static, who, after learning her tragic past, manages to reach out and calm her down. The girl is taken to a local [[church (building)|church]] for help in their homeless program, which she gratefully accepts.\n\n===Nails===\n'''Allie Langford/Nails''' ([[Sibhan Fallen]]) - A teenage girl who experienced a delayed reaction to the Big Bang. Allie's exposure to the Big-Bang has transmuted her literally into a 'Girl of Steel', with the ability to lengthen and retract the length of her fingernails, as well as shoot them as projectiles and regenerate new fingernails. Allie wears heavy make-up on her face and hands and a full-length coat to hide her transformation from everyone, including her parents.<br />In her attempts to find a cure without drawing attention to her condition, Allie learns of a Bang-Baby Clinic online and ventures to [[Gotham City]]. To her dismay, Nails (as Allie took to calling herself) learns that the clinic is in fact a hoax to hire meta-human mercenaries for personal gain orchestrated by [[Harley Quinn]] and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], who played on Allie's insecurities and her desire to be returned to normal to persuade her into helping them rob a ship full of gold in exchange for a cure. Static and [[Batman]] foil the scheme. Later, however, after having been reunited with her parents in Dakota, Allie is sponsored for a treatment program at a new Bang-Baby clinic established by Batman's alter-ego Bruce Wayne, where she began to make progress in controlling and reversing her \"''metallic affliction''\".\n\n===Dule===\n'''Dule Jones''' ([[Marshall Jones (voice actor)|Marshall Jones]]) \u2013 A former gangbanger, he has metal tentacles which grow from his back (similar to [[Marvel Comics]] supervillain [[Doctor Octopus]]). Unlike fellow gang member Troy/Chainlink, Dule can retract his tentacles, and thus hide the fact that he is a Bang Baby. After the [[Big Bang (comics)|Big Bang]], Dule gives up his gang lifestyle to play professional [[American football|football]], but Chainlink tries to blackmail him for money, threatening to reveal his secret. When they confront each other, everyone finds out that his powers are more advanced than Dule's (due to the fact that he breathed in more gas). Then Dule goes public, defusing the threat and defeating Chainlink in a confrontation with help from Static, Gear, and other football players.\n\n==The Night-Breed==\nA group of Bang Babies recruited by Ebon. Its members are Bang Babies who have a fatal sensitivity to light, so they live underground. They are also very distinguishable, due to their vividly yellow-colored predator-type eyes. After Static and Gear thwart Ebon's plan, the Night-Breed refuses the duo's offer to help and retreat back into the darkness, though not without promising to remain their friends. It is assumed that after the events of the series' finale, \"Power Outage\", they are returned to their normal, non-powered state.<br />Despite the sole episode in which they appear making reference to more of these Bang Babies (season 4's \"Army of Darkness\"), these four are the only known members:\n\n===Nightingale===\n'''Nightingale/Gail''' ([[Colleen O'Shaughnessey]]) \u2013 Generates and controls a special black smoke-like dust called [[dark matter]] that she uses to protect herself from intense light and as a cover screen for escapes. Nightingale lives underground along with other light-sensitive Bang Babies and is recruited by Ebon, who names them the Night-Breed, but she turns on Ebon during his attempt to blanket the entire city in pure \"dark matter\" (giving them free rein of it), absorbing it into herself.\n\n===Brickhouse===\n'''Brickhouse''' (voiced by [[Dawnn Lewis]]) \u2013 Nightingale's best friend whom the [[Big Bang (comics)|Big Bang]] granted the ability to morph her body into a living brick-like humanoid state. She turns against Ebon when he traps Static, Gear, and Nightingale, and helps them escape. Brickhouse is based on one of the central characters of ''[[Blood Syndicate]]''.\n\n===Tech===\n'''Tech''' (voiced by [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]]) \u2013 Like Gear, the Big Bang gave him superhuman intelligence. He uses it to build a machine to cover the city in dark matter, and sides with Ebon when Nightingale and Brickhouse rebel and help Static and Gear to thwart it. Afterward, Tech decides to work on a cure for the Night-Breed's light sensitivity.\n\n===Fade===\n'''Fade''' ([[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]]) \u2013 Fade is physically intangible, i.e. he has the ability to pass through virtually anything. Fade sides with Ebon when Nightingale and Brickhouse rebel against him, and goes back into hiding after their attempted takeover of Dakota is thwarted. He is based on one of the central characters of ''[[Blood Syndicate]]''.\n\n==Other characters in Other Media==\n\n'''Static Shock, TV Series'''\n\n* '''Sean Foley''' ([[Dan Lauria]]): [[Rick Stone (DC Comics)|Richie Foley's]] father. A tough, blue-collar man. In \"Sons of the Fathers\", it is revealed that Mr. Foley is a racist who dislikes African-Americans. At the end of the episode, though, Mr. Foley apologizes and resolves to change his ways.\n* '''Maggie Foley''' ([[Jean Smart]]): [[Rick Stone (DC Comics)|Richie Foley's]] mother. Appears in \"Sons of the Fathers\" as a rather quiet, soft-spoken woman.\n* '''Bernie Rast''' ([[Kevin Michael Richardson]]): A sleazy, loud-mouth TV producer who always looks out for a big hit to promote his clients, and by extension, himself.\n* '''Shelly Sandoval''' ([[Maria Canals]]): A young news reporter in Dakota who regularly reports on the metahuman activities in town.\n* '''Mr. McGill''' ([[Phil LaMarr]]): Virgil's and Richie's algebra and physics teacher. Usually talks with a drawling tone, rendering his students unable to concentrate on his lectures.\n* '''Jimmy Osgood''' ([[Richard Steven Horvitz]]): An unstable boy who is a student at Virgil's school and is constantly bullied. This leads him to steal his father's gun and threaten his bully, Nick Connor with it. At first, he seems to surrender after Richie calms him down. However he accidentally shoots Richie in the leg, leaving Jimmy mentally unbalanced. He receives treatment some time later and is sent to a juvenile detention center.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/staticms.htm Static Bio] - ''Static'' Bio page\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120204081054/http://milestone.luthor.com/ The Milestone Rave] - includes a ''Static'' comic book index\n* [http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/staticshock/home.jsp WB Static Shock] ''Static Shock'' WB Homepage\n* [http://www.tv.com/static-shock/show/5217/summary.html Static Shock Animated Series Synopsis] Page on TV.com about ''Static Shock''\n* [http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=static Unofficial Guide to DC Comics entry]\n* {{IMDb title|title=Static Shock|id=0247729}}\n* [http://www.titanstower.com/static/ Titans Tower biography]\n\n{{Milestone Media}}\n{{Teen Titans}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Static}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:DC Comics metahumans]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with electric or magnetic abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with gravity abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional technopaths]]\n[[Category:Milestone Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Static Shock characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dwayne McDuffie]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=May 2014}}\nA list of friends, allies and associates of the [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]].\n\n==Family==\n\n===Immediate family===<!-- time-order -->\n*Robert Hawkins (father)\n*Jean Hawkins (mother)\n*Sharon Hawkins (sister)\n\n===Clones===<!-- alphabetical order -->\n*Alkalie (clone, presumed deceased)\n*Cassandra Hawkins (Sharon's clone, \"sister\")\n\n==Love interests==<!-- time-order -->\n\n===Virgil Hawkins love interests===\n*[[Daisy Watkins (DC Comics)|Daisy Watkins]]\n*[[Frieda Goren]]\n*Madison\n*Dusk\n*Vanessa (New 52)\n\n==Supporting characters==\n*[[Daisy Watkins (DC Comics)|Daisy Watkins]]\n*[[Larry Wade (DC Comics)|Larry Wade]]\n*[[Rick Stone (DC Comics)|Rick Stone]]\n*[[Frieda Goren]]\n* Charles \"Chuck\" Kane\n*Dusk\n*Felix\n*Hardware\n*Madison\n*Shadow Cabinet\n\n==Allies== \n*[[Teen Titans]]\n*[[Justice League]]\n*[[Heroes (comics)|Heroes]]\n*[[S.T.A.R.

The two go far back. He was voiced by [[Jason Marsden]]. He was not present for the Big Bang, but Static's clothes still carried some of the gas, and his powers were dormant until Season Three. His power is superhuman intelligence, having invented a number of weapons and devices for Static and himself to use. His superhuman intelligence allows for a very limited form of [[technopathy]] with his visor and Back-Pack, as seen in episode 52 when Richie was no longer able to interpret the data stream in his visor and his backpack was no longer able to sync with his brain, which was at genius level when Back-Pack was programmed.\n\nAccording to series creators, Richie's character was based on [[Rick Stone (DC Comics)|Rick Stone]], Virgil's best friend in the comics, who is gay. However, since his sexual orientation could not be explored within the context of a children's television series, it was not addressed.\n\n===Rubberband Man===\n'''Adam Evans/Rubberband Man''' (voiced by [[Kadeem Hardison]]) \u2013 Adam Evans is a meta-human whose body structure consists of living rubber, which he can shape into a wide variety of forms, even to the point of altering his physical appearance into that of another person. Rubberband Man and his brother Ebon can both stretch themselves which suggests that the effects of the gas may have something to do with the person's genetic code. The name \"''Adam Evans''\" is derived from the names of former [[Milestone Comics|Milestone]] writers [[Maddie Blaustein|Adam Blaustein]] and [[Yves Fezzani]], who created the character. The alias \"Stringer\" Rubberband Man uses in one episode is his real last name of his comic version, first used in ''[[Static (DC Comics)|Static]]'' #34.\n\nAdam is also a talented musician who is on the verge of a professional career. His greatest personal weakness is a [[dyslexia|reading disorder]] which he has to struggle through. He is the younger brother of Static's archenemy, [[#Ebon|Ebon]]. Prior to the [[Big Bang (comics)|Big Bang]], Adam was part of his brother's gang before he took a stock-clerk job at a music store called Stonegas Records. Rubberband Man first appears as a [[tragic villain]] when he goes after an opportunistic record producer who had stolen one of his songs. He subsequently breaks out of prison but deciding not to pursue a criminal career, uses his powers to take up a new identity, \"Stringer\", and becomes a musical rising star. He also starts dating Virgil's sister Sharon, and although he initially clashes with Static, he does not carry on his grudge against him after meeting Sharon and even reforms and becomes one of his allies in crime-fighting. While on patrol, Rubberband Man typically acts as an older brother figure to Static, keeping him from showing off and reminding him of consequences in their work, something that Adam's real brother Ebon never actually did when he looked after Adam prior to the Big Bang. It is unknown if Adam Evans is exposed to the cure for the Big Bang that neutralizes many of the Bang Babies in Dakota at the end of the series.\n===She-Bang===\nShe-Bang, although her real name is Shanice Vale, is a girl with superhuman strength, stamina, agility, reflexes, and endurance. Although she seems like a meta-human she actually was not exposed to the gas; she is really a science project made by her parents, Jonathon and Dolores, who made her [[chromosome]] by [[chromosome]]. They fell in love with her and went into hiding from a group of people who want to clone her, so she had to act like a shy, normal person until she moved to Dakota trying to blend in with the other Bang-Babies. When all the people who were after her were captured, she and her parents moved back to Dakota. She has not been seen since.\n\n===Time-Zone===\n'''Nina Crocker/Time-Zone''' ([[Rachael MacFarlane]]) \u2013 A Bang Baby with the ability to warp time, allowing her to travel into the past; during her time with her abilities, she is one of the strongest and most powerful metahumans on the planet. While looking for Static and Gear, she bumps into Ebon, who wants to use her powers to avoid the cops. After being saved from Ebon, Gear runs tests on her and finds out that she has no control over her powers. Since she wants to become a hero, Gear makes a remote that is linked to a belt around her costume. The remote helps her control her powers. Now named as the superhero Time-Zone, Nina becomes the third member of the Shock Pack, but her time as a member is brief: Due to an encounter with Ebon, Nina decides that her powers are too dangerous to keep, and goes back in time to stop her past self from being present at the night of the [[Big Bang (comics)|Big Bang]] (by stealing her own bike, according to Richie.) Nina is now a happy, ordinary girl, and has no memory of her life in the original timeline as Time-Zone. Time-Zone's powers were based on Flashback's from ''[[Blood Syndicate]]''.\n\n===Anansi the Spider===\n'''[[Anansi]] the Spider''' (voiced by [[Carl Lumbly]]) \u2013 A [[superhero]] native to [[Ghana]], and the greatest hero in [[West Africa]]. Named after the trickster spider of African folklore, Anansi has the power to create visible, realistic [[illusion]]s. In his own words he explains it as: \"''people only see what I want them to see.''\" He also has the ability to cling to surfaces, stand upside-down, and walk on [[vertical direction|vertical]] surfaces.

In the episode \"Out of Africa,\" Anansi travels to Dakota to stop Osebo, Mmboro, and Onini (three of his enemies, based on the animals that the legendary [[Anansi]] caught to attain his stories,) from obtaining an ancient, golden spider talisman, which is revealed to be the source of Anansi's powers. Sharon mysteriously obtains the artifact, uses it to make all of the dirty dishes \"disappear,\" and takes it for a spin, which leads to her being kidnapped. Static and Gear get drawn in when Sharon is kidnapped. In the end, Static, Gear, and Anansi rescue her, and Anansi reclaims the artifact. The spider artifact was never seen again afterward, as Anansi made sure to hide it.\n\nAnansi's enemies are based on an ancient legend; the story, as told by Anansi, was that a clever Spider wanted to be able to tell stories, and the \"Sky Spirit\" king of all the lands agreed to give the spider what he wanted if he captured three troublemakers: Onini the Python, Osebo the Leopard, and the Mmoboro Hornet. The Spider trapped Mmoboro in a [[gourd]], tied Onini to a stick, and dug a pit and covered it with leaves, then lured Osebo into it. The Sky Spirit thanked the spider and granted its wish, giving it the ability to tell stories through the power of making illusions. Anansi has three enemies: Mmoboro, a giant talking wasp who can turn into a swarm of smaller wasps, Onini, a giant talking black [[Pythonidae|python]], and Osebo, a large man-shaped talking leopard with a metal fist. At first sight, everyone mistakes Osebo for a tiger as he has stripes instead of spots; everyone who has ever heard that his is a leopard wonders why he has stripes. Anansi himself told Static in \"Out of Africa,\" \"I too often wonder about the stripes.\" It is still unknown why Osebo has stripes.\n\n===Soul Power===\n'''Morris Grant/Soul Power''' (voiced by [[Brock Peters]]) \u2013 An elderly [[superhero]] with powers similar to Static's; he now lives in a [[retirement home]], but back in the 1960s, he protected Dakota from criminals. He gained his powers in an accident at [[Hoover Dam]]. He had a [[Batcave]]-like headquarters hidden underground in/near Dakota's [[rapid transit]] system called the Power Pad, and drove a car called the Soulmobile. Back then, he also had a sidekick, Sparky. He, Sparky, and Static team up in order to defeat Soul Power's greatest foe, Professor Menace, who disappeared after a battle with Soul Power in 1963. Soul Power is similar to the [[DC Comics]] superhero [[Black Lightning]].\n\n===Sparky===\n'''Phillip Rollins/Sparky''' (voiced by [[Rodney Saulsberry]]) \u2013 He was Soul Power's sidekick back in the 1970s, but he is now a [[meteorologist]]. Rollins takes on the guise of Sparky one more time in order to help Static and Soul Power fight Professor Menace. His powers were derived from a suit he originally invented and wore so he could be like his idol, Soul Power, and fight alongside him. He too is like Black Lightning and like [[Batman]]'s sidekick, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].\n\n===Hoop Squad===\n'''The Hoop Squad''' heroes Pulverizer, Spindrive, Centerforce, and Pointman are superheroes who work for a secret government. They all have their powers in their super suits and they have secret identities. When they are not fighting crime, they are famous NBA players [[Steve Nash]], [[Yao Ming]], [[Karl Malone]], and [[Tracy McGrady]].\n\n==Other Bang Babies==\n\n===D-Struct===\n'''Derek \"Zee-Bee\" Barnett/D-Struct''' (voiced by [[Bumper Robinson]]) \u2013 A track athlete whose powers generate and envelop him in a shroud composed of compressed [[ion]]ic energy, which can protect him from harm or be directed at targets, but which also gives him the appearance of monstrous [[Doppelg\u00e4nger|apparition]]. Derek is captured by Ebon and coerced into joining the Meta-Breed, (feeling he has no other choice), and is given the name \"D-Struct.\"  Static is able to persuade Derek to quit the gang and return home to his mother. Afterwards, Derek volunteers himself as a subject for Bang Baby research. He is based on a character who appeared in both the Static and ''[[Hardware (comics)|Hardware]]'' comics.\n\n===Dwayne McCall===\n'''Dwayne McCall''' (voiced by [[Blayn Barbosa]]) \u2013 is a pre-teenaged boy who possesses reality-manipulating powers after exposure to Big Bang gas, allowing him to change things into anything else he can clearly imagine, (he has to know what they/it looks, [[Odor|smells]], or [[sound]]s like, etc.). Dwayne is shy, misguided, and doesn't have very many friends, and likes to conjure characters from his favorite comic books, computer games,TV shows and commercials, bringing them to life with his powers. His stepbrother, Aaron Price, finds out about his powers and talks him into getting him free money and other goods from the banks and malls of Dakota. Static eventually discovers what\u2019s going on and tells Dwayne to stop listening to his brother. Dwayne does not believe what [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] was saying (and tries to kill him in rage), but [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] plays a tape of himself (as Virgil) and Aaron talking, in which Aaron expresses his dislike of Dwayne.

It is assumed that after the events of the series' finale, \"Power Outage\", they are returned to their normal, non-powered state.<br />Despite the sole episode in which they appear making reference to more of these Bang Babies (season 4's \"Army of Darkness\"), these four are the only known members:\n\n===Nightingale===\n'''Nightingale/Gail''' ([[Colleen O'Shaughnessey]]) \u2013 Generates and controls a special black smoke-like dust called [[dark matter]] that she uses to protect herself from intense light and as a cover screen for escapes. Nightingale lives underground along with other light-sensitive Bang Babies and is recruited by Ebon, who names them the Night-Breed, but she turns on Ebon during his attempt to blanket the entire city in pure \"dark matter\" (giving them free rein of it), absorbing it into herself.\n\n===Brickhouse===\n'''Brickhouse''' (voiced by [[Dawnn Lewis]]) \u2013 Nightingale's best friend whom the [[Big Bang (comics)|Big Bang]] granted the ability to morph her body into a living brick-like humanoid state. She turns against Ebon when he traps Static, Gear, and Nightingale, and helps them escape. Brickhouse is based on one of the central characters of ''[[Blood Syndicate]]''.\n\n===Tech===\n'''Tech''' (voiced by [[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]]) \u2013 Like Gear, the Big Bang gave him superhuman intelligence. He uses it to build a machine to cover the city in dark matter, and sides with Ebon when Nightingale and Brickhouse rebel and help Static and Gear to thwart it. Afterward, Tech decides to work on a cure for the Night-Breed's light sensitivity.\n\n===Fade===\n'''Fade''' ([[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]]) \u2013 Fade is physically intangible, i.e. he has the ability to pass through virtually anything. Fade sides with Ebon when Nightingale and Brickhouse rebel against him, and goes back into hiding after their attempted takeover of Dakota is thwarted. He is based on one of the central characters of ''[[Blood Syndicate]]''.\n\n==Other characters in Other Media==\n\n'''Static Shock, TV Series'''\n\n* '''Sean Foley''' ([[Dan Lauria]]): [[Rick Stone (DC Comics)|Richie Foley's]] father. A tough, blue-collar man. In \"Sons of the Fathers\", it is revealed that Mr. Foley is a racist who dislikes African-Americans. At the end of the episode, though, Mr. Foley apologizes and resolves to change his ways.\n* '''Maggie Foley''' ([[Jean Smart]]): [[Rick Stone (DC Comics)|Richie Foley's]] mother. Appears in \"Sons of the Fathers\" as a rather quiet, soft-spoken woman.\n* '''Bernie Rast''' ([[Kevin Michael Richardson]]): A sleazy, loud-mouth TV producer who always looks out for a big hit to promote his clients, and by extension, himself.\n* '''Shelly Sandoval''' ([[Maria Canals]]): A young news reporter in Dakota who regularly reports on the metahuman activities in town.\n* '''Mr. McGill''' ([[Phil LaMarr]]): Virgil's and Richie's algebra and physics teacher. Usually talks with a drawling tone, rendering his students unable to concentrate on his lectures.\n* '''Jimmy Osgood''' ([[Richard Steven Horvitz]]): An unstable boy who is a student at Virgil's school and is constantly bullied. This leads him to steal his father's gun and threaten his bully, Nick Connor with it. At first, he seems to surrender after Richie calms him down. However he accidentally shoots Richie in the leg, leaving Jimmy mentally unbalanced. He receives treatment some time later and is sent to a juvenile detention center.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/staticms.htm Static Bio] - ''Static'' Bio page\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120204081054/http://milestone.luthor.com/ The Milestone Rave] - includes a ''Static'' comic book index\n* [http://www2.warnerbros.com/web/staticshock/home.jsp WB Static Shock] ''Static Shock'' WB Homepage\n* [http://www.tv.com/static-shock/show/5217/summary.html Static Shock Animated Series Synopsis] Page on TV.com about ''Static Shock''\n* [http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=static Unofficial Guide to DC Comics entry]\n* {{IMDb title|title=Static Shock|id=0247729}}\n* [http://www.titanstower.com/static/ Titans Tower biography]\n\n{{Milestone Media}}\n{{Teen Titans}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Static}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:DC Comics metahumans]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with electric or magnetic abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with gravity abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional technopaths]]\n[[Category:Milestone Comics characters]]\n[[Category:Static Shock characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dwayne McDuffie]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDwayne McCall:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: what\u2019s \u2192 what's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Static_supporting_characters"}

Meyers introduced Stefon as a guide who knows all about New York and asks him for tips on essential destinations and events for visitors. Stefon recommends unusual clubs and parties with bizarre characters and very specific tastes, described as \"visions a dying gay man would have if he was under too many blankets,\"<ref>Season 35 Episode 20 (aired 2/12/2011)</ref> \"nightmares of a crystal meth addict,\" or a \"coked-up gay [[Candyland]].\"<ref>Season 36, Episode 4; Weekend Update (10/23/2010)</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How SNL's Bill Hader creates New York's weirdest nightclubs|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/snl-bill-hader-stefon-clubs-interview/|accessdate=April 17, 2015|work=Daily Dot|date=November 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\n\nStefon's segments were inspired by real people Hader and Mulaney had encountered. One was a club promoter who sent Mulaney an email about a club that \"had everything,\" including \"rooms full of broken glass\" as one of the highlights.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stefon, from \"S.N.L.,\" Is Real and Works in a New York Coffee Shop |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAK15tZmSAM |accessdate=February 23, 2020 |work=The New Yorker Festival |date=Oct 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe character's mannerisms were based on a barista at a coffee shop in [[Chelsea, Manhattan]] that Hader frequented who looked and talked like Stefon.<ref name=\"test\">Potts, Kim (September 24, 2010) [http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/09/24/snl-star-bill-hader-talks-the-new-season-jon-hamms-return-an/ \"'SNL' Star Bill Hader Talks the New Season, Jon Hamm's Return and His 'Surreal Life' Experience with Corey Feldman\"]. ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.</ref> Mulaney decided that Stefon should wear an [[Don Ed Hardy|Ed Hardy]] shirt, under the assumption that it was made of latex and looked like something out of the Macaulay Culkin and Seth Green film, ''[[Party Monster (film)|Party Monster]]''. Stefon's hair was inspired by the characters in that film, \"specifically based in popup club culture in New York City circa 2007\".<ref name=\"behind\">{{cite web |title=Behind the Sketch: Stefon with John Mulaney - SNL |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C14eXiZQWo |website=Saturday Night Live |accessdate=February 23, 2020 |date=April 14, 2018}}</ref> \n\n==Production==\nInitially, Stefon appeared in a 2008 sketch with [[Ben Affleck]] titled \"Movie Pitch with Stefon,\" with Stefon portraying the outrageous brother of Affleck's more serious character, David Zolesky; however, the idea \"barely worked as a sketch,\" said [[Bill Hader]]. \"It was a long walk to get to what the sketch was about.\"<ref name=\"origin\">{{cite web |title=Bill Hader on the Origin of Stefon |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71Mm8RymCZw |website=Late Night with Seth Meyers |accessdate=February 23, 2020 |date=September 15, 2014}}</ref> \n\nThe  character was instead introduced as a correspondent on ''Weekend Update'' the following season, after an invitation from the head of the segment. According to [[Seth Meyers]], \"It was a lot easier to just say, 'Hey, here's Stefon.'\"<ref name=\"origin\"/> During the production for his first appearance on  ''Weekend Update'', on the April 24, 2010 episode, Mulaney assumed it would be cut after rehearsal. He stated, \"It was so weird that I so assumed it would be cut, and I said, 'When you cut this, can we try it again?' We just thought it was not going to be liked by anyone.\" However, the character became immensely popular.<ref name=\"behind\"/>\n\nOften Hader can be seen suppressing fits of laughter (known as [[corpsing]]), as some of the more outlandish descriptions are new to him. Hader, on late-night TV interviews, said that this happens with such frequency because changes are often made to the script up until the live show, and frequently Hader does not see the final cue cards until the live broadcast. As a result, some of the more outrageous things that Stefon says are relatively or completely new to Hader. \"I have not gotten through a single Stefon update without breaking,\" Hader says. \"Still working on it.\"<ref>Statdtmiller, Mandy.

Retrieved May 21, 2012.</ref>\n\nAfter being unable to perform the character without breaking for two and a half years, Hader successfully remained in character as Stefon during the season finale of the show's [[Saturday Night Live (season 36)|36th season]], with host [[Justin Timberlake]]. However, this appearance was much briefer than his others, with his appearance only lasting about 30 seconds. According to Hader, it is \"completely ironic\" that he played a character like Stefon, because he avoids loud places such as clubs.<ref name=\"fallon20130905\">{{cite web | url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/05/bill-hader-is-sad-to-leave-saturday-night-live-and-stefon-behind.html | title=Bill Hader Is Sad to Leave \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 (and Stefon) Behind | work=The Daily Beast | date=2013-09-05 | accessdate=5 September 2013 | author=Fallon, Kevin}}</ref>\n\nStefon's last regular appearance on ''SNL'' was on May 18, 2013, owing to Bill Hader's leaving the show. As part of the ''Weekend Update'' comedy skit, Seth Meyers realized how much he actually loved Stefon and \"married\" him.\n\nWhen Meyers' ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers|Late Night]]'' premiered on February 24, 2014, a Stefon [[matryoshka doll]] with a veil embellishment, originally hand-crafted by matryoshka artist Irene Hwang and commissioned for a crew holiday gift, was unveiled as part of the decor of Meyers' desktop.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2014/02/the-late-night-with-seth-meyer.html|title=The Late Night With Seth Meyers Premiere: Fred Armisen, Amy Poehler, and a Tiny Stefon|last=Angelo|first=Megan|date=25 February 2014|magazine=[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour.com]]|accessdate=9 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bobobabushka.wordpress.com/2014/01/26/live-from-new-york/|title=Live From New York\u2026 |date=26 January 2014|work=[[WordPress.com]]|publisher=BoBo Babushka|accessdate=9 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nMulaney began writing a Stefon feature film before he left ''SNL''. The film was intended to be a [[mockumentary]], showing Stefon visiting different New York hotspots as a correspondent for ''Weekend Update''. Mulaney wanted to cast director [[Garry Marshall]] as [[Lorne Michaels]]. However, the film never moved beyond an initial writing stage.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wright |first1=Megh |title=John Mulaney and Seth Meyers Talk About the Stefon Movie That Never Got Made |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/snl-john-mulaney-seth-meyers-stefon-movie.html |work=Vulture |date=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nStefon is a flamboyantly gay \"city correspondent\" for ''Weekend Update''. He appears to be always nervous, as indicated by how he can never keep his hands still and constantly rubs them together. Stefon always touches his face and hair, and it seems like he has frequent anxiety attacks. A possible explanation for this is his excessive consumption of recreational drugs.<ref name=\"test\"/> Stefon is very knowledgeable about parties and [[nightclub]]s featuring very bizarre themes and characters, which he recommends when host Seth Meyers asks for suggestions for tourists, much to Meyers' frustration. Stefon is apparently infatuated with Meyers; he expresses disappointment when Meyers mentions his girlfriend, and has stated that he envies Meyers' mother for changing his diapers as a child.\n\nAccording to the May 7, 2011, episode of ''Saturday Night Live'', his mother is named Ms. Stefon, and his father is [[David Bowie]]. In the October 20, 2012, episode, he mentions he has a dog named [[Mark Ruffalo|Bark Ruffalo]]. He lives in a trashcan outside the [[RadioShack]] at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd]] and [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|7th]]. Stefon wears gaudy [[Don Ed Hardy|Ed Hardy]] shirts, multiple rings, and an asymmetrical, highlighted haircut.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vineyard|first1=Jennifer|title=Bill Hader Would Totally Do a Stefon Bit at the CFDA Awards|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2012/03/bill-hader-would-totally-do-a-stefon-bit-at-the-cfdas.html|accessdate=April 17, 2015|work=[[New York Magazine]]|date=March 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nStefon, the City Correspondent on ''Weekend Update'', is introduced by Seth Meyers and is asked for recommendations for tourists. Stefon's dialogue always begins with \u201cNew York\u2019s hottest club is \u2026\u201d and then he starts listing the outlandish patrons that you can meet at this club. He is frequently interrupted by Seth Meyers, who asks for more family-friendly destinations, but Stefon only continues talking about increasingly ludicrous New York clubs with suggestively descriptive names (Crease, Gush, Push, Booooooooof [\"with nine O's\"], Spicy, Kevin?, Whimsy, Your Mother and I Are Separating, PANTS!, et al.).\n\nSecurity, entertainers, and clientele at the venue are surreal, implied to be from hyper-specific or obscure subcultures, which an impressed Stefon usually introduces by complimenting \"this place has ''everything''\". Bouncers include: jacked-up homeless guys in period swimming costumes, Hobocops (homeless [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCops]]), a bulldog who looks like [[Wilford Brimley]], and a rabbi who looks like [[Joaquin Phoenix]]. Passwords for some of the clubs include \"My wallet? YEEEEAH, RIGHT!\" (\"the last words of murdered blues legend [[Blind Willie Walker|Sweet Willie Walker]]\") and \"Diabetes\" (said in a [[Wilford Brimley]] voice). When mentioning the club's typical patrons, he lists outlandish characters such as screaming babies in Mozart wigs, Puppets in disguise, an [[Albino]] who looks like [[Susan Powter]], Puppets practicing Karate, sunburned drifters with soap bubble beards, and groups of guys with afros in graduation caps. Underground celebrities to be found at the venues include Blingo (Black [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]]), [[Blacula|Jewish Dracula]] Sidney Applebaum, nine-year-old Tokyo pimp Ichi Yakaguro <ref name=\"test.,<ref name=\"test2\">Season 35, Episode 20 (aired 4/24/2010).</ref> and 300-pound Chinese baby deejay DJ Baby Bok Choy.<ref>\"''He's a giant 300-pound Chinese baby, who wears tinted aviator glasses and he spins records with his little ravioli hands.''\" Season 25, Episode 20, Retrieved (Jan 25, 2011).</ref>\n\nWhen describing the club\u2019s attractions, Stefon repeatedly uses vague faux pop culture [[portmanteau]]x and slang terms including \"Jewpids\" (Jewish Cupids), \"Furkels\" (fat [[Steve Urkel|Urkels]]) and \"[[Teddy Grahams|Teddy Graham]] people\" (\"...when a guy has the stumpy arms but with the belly\"). Stefon also frequently mentions objects personified by [[dwarfism|little people]] (\"human fanny packs,\" \"human traffic cones,\" \"human fire hydrants,\" \"human boomboxes,\" \"human suitcases,\" \"human kites\", \"human R2-D2s\", \"human pi\u00f1atas\", \"human Roombas\" (also called \"Hoombas\") and \"human Magic 8 balls.\"), which he originally referred to as \"midgets\". When Seth Meyers pointed out in one segment that the term \"midget\" was politically incorrect, Stefon corrected himself and referred to them as \"fun-sized\"; in a 2018 guest appearance alongside Colin Jost and Michael Che, Stefon brought his lawyer Shy (John Mulaney) onto the show to inform him that the correct term was \"little people\". The club owners Stefon describes are almost always malapropisms of famous celebrities' names, e.g., [[Susan Lucci|Snoozin Lucci]], [[Lou Diamond Phillips|Jew Diamond Phillips]], [[Anderson Cooper|Tranderson Cooper]], [[Tony Danza|Baloney Danza]], [[Pat Sajak|Fat Sajak]], [[Ray Liotta|Gay Liotta]], [[Faye Dunaway|Gay Dunaway]], [[Annie Oakley|Tranny Oakley]], [[Deepak Chopra|D-bag Chopra]], and [[O. J. Simpson|Blow J. Simpson]]. His style comes close to [[absurdist humor]], mocking New York City's notorious [[Club Kids|Club Kid scene]]. In the November 10, 2012 episode, hosted by [[Anne Hathaway]], Stefon did not appear, but Hathaway made a joking reference to playing him.\n\n==Final regular appearance and guest appearances==\n\nStefon made his last recurring ''[[Weekend Update]]'' appearance on [[Saturday Night Live (season 38)|Season 38 Episode 21]] on May 18, 2013. After Stefon's usual comment on \"New York's hottest club\", [[Seth Meyers]] again criticized his recommendations, making Stefon flee out of [[NBC Studios (New York)|NBC Studios]] to get married. Seeing the error of his ways, Seth goes after him to the wedding at the Marble Collegiate Church on [[Fifth Avenue]] only to find out that Stefon is marrying [[Anderson Cooper]]. Seth goes in after Stefon and takes him away from the wedding back to Studio 8H, where they proclaim their love for each other. The wedding guests included Black [[George Washington]] as the minister, a puppet in disguise ([[ALF (TV series)|ALF]] in a trenchcoat), human traffic cones and a human fire hydrant, HoboCops, Jewpids, infamous gay running back Blowjay Simpson, a group of guys with afros and graduation caps, grown men in wedding dresses, jacked homeless guys in period bathing suits, Gizblow the coked-up [[Gremlins|Gremlin]], Furkel (fat [[Steve Urkel]]), evil chef [[Wario]] [[Mario Batali|Batali]], Germfs (German [[The Smurfs|Smurfs]]), Sidney Applebaum the Jewish Dracula, a screaming geisha, Hanukkah cartoon character [[Dora the Explorer|Menorah the Explorer]], and DJ Baby Bok Choy. [[Ben Affleck]] makes a cameo appearance reprising his role as Stefon's brother, David Zolefsky.<ref>{{cite web|title=DAVID ZOLEFSKY SKETCHES|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/ben-affleck-57976/character/david-zolefsky-101671|publisher=[[NBC]]|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}</ref> After they return to the studio, various Weekend Update characters including [[David Paterson]] ([[Fred Armisen]]), Jacob the Bar Mitzvah Boy ([[Vanessa Bayer]]), Drunk Uncle ([[Bobby Moynihan]]), [[Arianna Huffington]] ([[Nasim Pedrad]]), The Devil ([[Jason Sudeikis]]), Jean K. Jean ([[Kenan Thompson]]), [[Ann Romney]] ([[Kate McKinnon]]) and The Girl You Wished You Didn't Start a Conversation with at a Party ([[Cecily Strong]]) along with [[Amy Poehler]] congratulate them by throwing rice. Seth refers to them as Seth and Stefon Meyers and closes out ''Weekend Update''.\n\nStefon returned to the ''Weekend Update'' desk in a guest appearance along with [[Amy Poehler]] to wish Meyers good luck in his final ''Weekend Update'', as Meyers prepared to become the new host of ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]''. Stefon's jokes included that the world (outside ''SNL'') \"has everything...\", such as homeless weightlifters that look like [[The Croods]], Japanese daredevil [[Yoko Ono|YOLO Ono]] and human [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]s, to which Stefon replied \"It's that thing where a midget sits on your TV and tells you what happened on ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]''. And like a regular cable box, it goes down all the time\". Before Seth's final Weekend Update goodbye, he acknowledged Stefon as his husband. In this appearance, Hader again broke character after the human DVR joke.\n\nStefon returned to the show on the October 11, 2014 episode, hosted by Hader. In this appearance he recommended clubs for tourists interested in autumn in New York. He expressed shock at new ''Weekend Update'' hosts [[Colin Jost]] and [[Michael Che]], questioning how long he had been on anesthesia, before looking at their racial make-up and remarking \"one of each.\" The sketch was co-written by John Mulaney, who worked on it with Hader over Skype and texted new jokes to the writers to once again surprise Hader, who barely began the sketch before having to cover his face from laughing.

Stefon, who usually uses the term \"midget\" to describe his bizarre recommendations, chose not to use it in order to not be insensitive and consulted his attorney and conceptual piss artist named Shy (played by [[John Mulaney]], who co-created Stefon) for a better term, ultimately using \"little people\".

One was a club promoter who sent Mulaney an email about a club that \"had everything,\" including \"rooms full of broken glass\" as one of the highlights.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stefon, from \"S.N.L.,\" Is Real and Works in a New York Coffee Shop |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAK15tZmSAM |accessdate=February 23, 2020 |work=The New Yorker Festival |date=Oct 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe character's mannerisms were based on a barista at a coffee shop in [[Chelsea, Manhattan]] that Hader frequented who looked and talked like Stefon.<ref name=\"test\">Potts, Kim (September 24, 2010) [http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/09/24/snl-star-bill-hader-talks-the-new-season-jon-hamms-return-an/ \"'SNL' Star Bill Hader Talks the New Season, Jon Hamm's Return and His 'Surreal Life' Experience with Corey Feldman\"]. ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.</ref> Mulaney decided that Stefon should wear an [[Don Ed Hardy|Ed Hardy]] shirt, under the assumption that it was made of latex and looked like something out of the Macaulay Culkin and Seth Green film, ''[[Party Monster (film)|Party Monster]]''. Stefon's hair was inspired by the characters in that film, \"specifically based in popup club culture in New York City circa 2007\".<ref name=\"behind\">{{cite web |title=Behind the Sketch: Stefon with John Mulaney - SNL |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C14eXiZQWo |website=Saturday Night Live |accessdate=February 23, 2020 |date=April 14, 2018}}</ref> \n\n==Production==\nInitially, Stefon appeared in a 2008 sketch with [[Ben Affleck]] titled \"Movie Pitch with Stefon,\" with Stefon portraying the outrageous brother of Affleck's more serious character, David Zolesky; however, the idea \"barely worked as a sketch,\" said [[Bill Hader]]. \"It was a long walk to get to what the sketch was about.\"<ref name=\"origin\">{{cite web |title=Bill Hader on the Origin of Stefon |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71Mm8RymCZw |website=Late Night with Seth Meyers |accessdate=February 23, 2020 |date=September 15, 2014}}</ref> \n\nThe  character was instead introduced as a correspondent on ''Weekend Update'' the following season, after an invitation from the head of the segment. According to [[Seth Meyers]], \"It was a lot easier to just say, 'Hey, here's Stefon.'\"<ref name=\"origin\"/> During the production for his first appearance on  ''Weekend Update'', on the April 24, 2010 episode, Mulaney assumed it would be cut after rehearsal. He stated, \"It was so weird that I so assumed it would be cut, and I said, 'When you cut this, can we try it again?' We just thought it was not going to be liked by anyone.\" However, the character became immensely popular.<ref name=\"behind\"/>\n\nOften Hader can be seen suppressing fits of laughter (known as [[corpsing]]), as some of the more outlandish descriptions are new to him. Hader, on late-night TV interviews, said that this happens with such frequency because changes are often made to the script up until the live show, and frequently Hader does not see the final cue cards until the live broadcast. As a result, some of the more outrageous things that Stefon says are relatively or completely new to Hader. \"I have not gotten through a single Stefon update without breaking,\" Hader says. \"Still working on it.\"<ref>Statdtmiller, Mandy.

Retrieved May 21, 2012.</ref>\n\nAfter being unable to perform the character without breaking for two and a half years, Hader successfully remained in character as Stefon during the season finale of the show's [[Saturday Night Live (season 36)|36th season]], with host [[Justin Timberlake]]. However, this appearance was much briefer than his others, with his appearance only lasting about 30 seconds. According to Hader, it is \"completely ironic\" that he played a character like Stefon, because he avoids loud places such as clubs.<ref name=\"fallon20130905\">{{cite web | url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/09/05/bill-hader-is-sad-to-leave-saturday-night-live-and-stefon-behind.html | title=Bill Hader Is Sad to Leave \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 (and Stefon) Behind | work=The Daily Beast | date=2013-09-05 | accessdate=5 September 2013 | author=Fallon, Kevin}}</ref>\n\nStefon's last regular appearance on ''SNL'' was on May 18, 2013, owing to Bill Hader's leaving the show. As part of the ''Weekend Update'' comedy skit, Seth Meyers realized how much he actually loved Stefon and \"married\" him.\n\nWhen Meyers' ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers|Late Night]]'' premiered on February 24, 2014, a Stefon [[matryoshka doll]] with a veil embellishment, originally hand-crafted by matryoshka artist Irene Hwang and commissioned for a crew holiday gift, was unveiled as part of the decor of Meyers' desktop.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.glamour.com/entertainment/blogs/obsessed/2014/02/the-late-night-with-seth-meyer.html|title=The Late Night With Seth Meyers Premiere: Fred Armisen, Amy Poehler, and a Tiny Stefon|last=Angelo|first=Megan|date=25 February 2014|magazine=[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour.com]]|accessdate=9 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bobobabushka.wordpress.com/2014/01/26/live-from-new-york/|title=Live From New York\u2026 |date=26 January 2014|work=[[WordPress.com]]|publisher=BoBo Babushka|accessdate=9 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nMulaney began writing a Stefon feature film before he left ''SNL''. The film was intended to be a [[mockumentary]], showing Stefon visiting different New York hotspots as a correspondent for ''Weekend Update''. Mulaney wanted to cast director [[Garry Marshall]] as [[Lorne Michaels]]. However, the film never moved beyond an initial writing stage.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wright |first1=Megh |title=John Mulaney and Seth Meyers Talk About the Stefon Movie That Never Got Made |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/snl-john-mulaney-seth-meyers-stefon-movie.html |work=Vulture |date=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nStefon is a flamboyantly gay \"city correspondent\" for ''Weekend Update''. He appears to be always nervous, as indicated by how he can never keep his hands still and constantly rubs them together. Stefon always touches his face and hair, and it seems like he has frequent anxiety attacks. A possible explanation for this is his excessive consumption of recreational drugs.<ref name=\"test\"/> Stefon is very knowledgeable about parties and [[nightclub]]s featuring very bizarre themes and characters, which he recommends when host Seth Meyers asks for suggestions for tourists, much to Meyers' frustration. Stefon is apparently infatuated with Meyers; he expresses disappointment when Meyers mentions his girlfriend, and has stated that he envies Meyers' mother for changing his diapers as a child.\n\nAccording to the May 7, 2011, episode of ''Saturday Night Live'', his mother is named Ms. Stefon, and his father is [[David Bowie]]. In the October 20, 2012, episode, he mentions he has a dog named [[Mark Ruffalo|Bark Ruffalo]]. He lives in a trashcan outside the [[RadioShack]] at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd]] and [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|7th]]. Stefon wears gaudy [[Don Ed Hardy|Ed Hardy]] shirts, multiple rings, and an asymmetrical, highlighted haircut.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vineyard|first1=Jennifer|title=Bill Hader Would Totally Do a Stefon Bit at the CFDA Awards|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2012/03/bill-hader-would-totally-do-a-stefon-bit-at-the-cfdas.html|accessdate=April 17, 2015|work=[[New York Magazine]]|date=March 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\nStefon, the City Correspondent on ''Weekend Update'', is introduced by Seth Meyers and is asked for recommendations for tourists. Stefon\u2019s dialogue always begins with \u201cNew York\u2019s hottest club is \u2026\u201d and then he starts listing the outlandish patrons that you can meet at this club. He is frequently interrupted by Seth Meyers, who asks for more family-friendly destinations, but Stefon only continues talking about increasingly ludicrous New York clubs with suggestively descriptive names (Crease, Gush, Push, Booooooooof [\"with nine O's\"], Spicy, Kevin?, Whimsy, Your Mother and I Are Separating, PANTS!, et al.).\n\nSecurity, entertainers, and clientele at the venue are surreal, implied to be from hyper-specific or obscure subcultures, which an impressed Stefon usually introduces by complimenting \"this place has ''everything''\". Bouncers include: jacked-up homeless guys in period swimming costumes, Hobocops (homeless [[RoboCop (character)|RoboCops]]), a bulldog who looks like [[Wilford Brimley]], and a rabbi who looks like [[Joaquin Phoenix]]. Passwords for some of the clubs include \"My wallet? YEEEEAH, RIGHT!\" (\"the last words of murdered blues legend [[Blind Willie Walker|Sweet Willie Walker]]\") and \"Diabetes\" (said in a [[Wilford Brimley]] voice). When mentioning the club's typical patrons, he lists outlandish characters such as screaming babies in Mozart wigs, Puppets in disguise, an [[Albino]] who looks like [[Susan Powter]], Puppets practicing Karate, sunburned drifters with soap bubble beards, and groups of guys with afros in graduation caps. Underground celebrities to be found at the venues include Blingo (Black [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]]), [[Blacula|Jewish Dracula]] Sidney Applebaum, nine-year-old Tokyo pimp Ichi Yakaguro <ref name=\"test.,<ref name=\"test2\">Season 35, Episode 20 (aired 4/24/2010).</ref> and 300-pound Chinese baby deejay DJ Baby Bok Choy.<ref>\"''He's a giant 300-pound Chinese baby, who wears tinted aviator glasses and he spins records with his little ravioli hands.''\" Season 25, Episode 20, Retrieved (Jan 25, 2011).</ref>\n\nWhen describing the club\u2019s attractions, Stefon repeatedly uses vague faux pop culture [[portmanteau]]x and slang terms including \"Jewpids\" (Jewish Cupids), \"Furkels\" (fat [[Steve Urkel|Urkels]]) and \"[[Teddy Grahams|Teddy Graham]] people\" (\"...when a guy has the stumpy arms but with the belly\"). Stefon also frequently mentions objects personified by [[dwarfism|little people]] (\"human fanny packs,\" \"human traffic cones,\" \"human fire hydrants,\" \"human boomboxes,\" \"human suitcases,\" \"human kites\", \"human R2-D2s\", \"human pi\u00f1atas\", \"human Roombas\" (also called \"Hoombas\") and \"human Magic 8 balls.\"), which he originally referred to as \"midgets\". When Seth Meyers pointed out in one segment that the term \"midget\" was politically incorrect, Stefon corrected himself and referred to them as \"fun-sized\"; in a 2018 guest appearance alongside Colin Jost and Michael Che, Stefon brought his lawyer Shy (John Mulaney) onto the show to inform him that the correct term was \"little people\". The club owners Stefon describes are almost always malapropisms of famous celebrities' names, e.g., [[Susan Lucci|Snoozin Lucci]], [[Lou Diamond Phillips|Jew Diamond Phillips]], [[Anderson Cooper|Tranderson Cooper]], [[Tony Danza|Baloney Danza]], [[Pat Sajak|Fat Sajak]], [[Ray Liotta|Gay Liotta]], [[Faye Dunaway|Gay Dunaway]], [[Annie Oakley|Tranny Oakley]], [[Deepak Chopra|D-bag Chopra]], and [[O. J. Simpson|Blow J. Simpson]]. His style comes close to [[absurdist humor]], mocking New York City's notorious [[Club Kids|Club Kid scene]]. In the November 10, 2012 episode, hosted by [[Anne Hathaway]], Stefon did not appear, but Hathaway made a joking reference to playing him.\n\n==Final regular appearance and guest appearances==\n\nStefon made his last recurring ''[[Weekend Update]]'' appearance on [[Saturday Night Live (season 38)|Season 38 Episode 21]] on May 18, 2013. After Stefon's usual comment on \"New York's hottest club\", [[Seth Meyers]] again criticized his recommendations, making Stefon flee out of [[NBC Studios (New York)|NBC Studios]] to get married. Seeing the error of his ways, Seth goes after him to the wedding at the Marble Collegiate Church on [[Fifth Avenue]] only to find out that Stefon is marrying [[Anderson Cooper]]. Seth goes in after Stefon and takes him away from the wedding back to Studio 8H, where they proclaim their love for each other. The wedding guests included Black [[George Washington]] as the minister, a puppet in disguise ([[ALF (TV series)|ALF]] in a trenchcoat), human traffic cones and a human fire hydrant, HoboCops, Jewpids, infamous gay running back Blowjay Simpson, a group of guys with afros and graduation caps, grown men in wedding dresses, jacked homeless guys in period bathing suits, Gizblow the coked-up [[Gremlins|Gremlin]], Furkel (fat [[Steve Urkel]]), evil chef [[Wario]] [[Mario Batali|Batali]], Germfs (German [[The Smurfs|Smurfs]]), Sidney Applebaum the Jewish Dracula, a screaming geisha, Hanukkah cartoon character [[Dora the Explorer|Menorah the Explorer]], and DJ Baby Bok Choy. [[Ben Affleck]] makes a cameo appearance reprising his role as Stefon's brother, David Zolefsky.<ref>{{cite web|title=DAVID ZOLEFSKY SKETCHES|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/cast/ben-affleck-57976/character/david-zolefsky-101671|publisher=[[NBC]]|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}</ref> After they return to the studio, various Weekend Update characters including [[David Paterson]] ([[Fred Armisen]]), Jacob the Bar Mitzvah Boy ([[Vanessa Bayer]]), Drunk Uncle ([[Bobby Moynihan]]), [[Arianna Huffington]] ([[Nasim Pedrad]]), The Devil ([[Jason Sudeikis]]), Jean K. Jean ([[Kenan Thompson]]), [[Ann Romney]] ([[Kate McKinnon]]) and The Girl You Wished You Didn't Start a Conversation with at a Party ([[Cecily Strong]]) along with [[Amy Poehler]] congratulate them by throwing rice. Seth refers to them as Seth and Stefon Meyers and closes out ''Weekend Update''.\n\nStefon returned to the ''Weekend Update'' desk in a guest appearance along with [[Amy Poehler]] to wish Meyers good luck in his final ''Weekend Update'', as Meyers prepared to become the new host of ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]''. Stefon's jokes included that the world (outside ''SNL'') \"has everything...\", such as homeless weightlifters that look like [[The Croods]], Japanese daredevil [[Yoko Ono|YOLO Ono]] and human [[Digital video recorder|DVR]]s, to which Stefon replied \"It's that thing where a midget sits on your TV and tells you what happened on ''[[Scandal (TV series)|Scandal]]''. And like a regular cable box, it goes down all the time\". Before Seth's final Weekend Update goodbye, he acknowledged Stefon as his husband. In this appearance, Hader again broke character after the human DVR joke.\n\nStefon returned to the show on the October 11, 2014 episode, hosted by Hader. In this appearance he recommended clubs for tourists interested in autumn in New York. He expressed shock at new ''Weekend Update'' hosts [[Colin Jost]] and [[Michael Che]], questioning how long he had been on anesthesia, before looking at their racial make-up and remarking \"one of each.\" The sketch was co-written by John Mulaney, who worked on it with Hader over Skype and texted new jokes to the writers to once again surprise Hader, who barely began the sketch before having to cover his face from laughing.

George debuted on-screen on 5 September 2011. George was introduced alongside the characters [[Neil Cooper (Hollyoaks)|Neil Cooper]] ([[Tosin Cole]]) and [[Callum Kane]] ([[Laurie Duncan]]); forming a new group of sixth-form college students. George is homosexual and is characterised as a \"sharp tongued fashionista\" with an unusual dress sense. He is best friends with [[Maddie Morrison]] ([[Scarlett Bowman]]) and [[Tilly Evans]] ([[Lucy Dixon]]), Roberts has said that George acts like their \"lap-dog\". However, George lacks confidence around the series' male characters.\n\nGeorge was brought to the forefront of the series when he features in a homelessness storyline. ''Hollyoaks'' worked with the charities [[Centrepoint (charity)|Centrepoint]] and [[Shelter (charity)|Shelter]] to conduct research into the issue. Roberts said the storyline raised awareness of a taboo subject in the media. The storyline portrayed George dealing with various aspects of homelessness and offered viewers an insight to the character. He has an \"unlikely\" friendship with Callum and his dynamic with [[Phoebe McQueen|Phoebe Jackson]] ([[Mandip Gill]]) reveals that George puts up an act around others to fit in. Anthony D. Langford of [[AfterElton.com]] has praised the storyline for highlighting the issue of homeless gay teenagers, while a columnist for ''[[Soaplife]]'' has embraced George's openness about his sexuality.\n\nRoberts left his role in 2014 and George made a surprise exit in the E4 episode on 17 September 2014.<ref>http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s13/hollyoaks/news/a597287/hollyoaks-actor-steven-roberts-leaves-george-role-its-been-fabulous.html#~oQ96ZUOmGOriaq</ref>\n\n==Character development==\n\n===Creation and characterisation===\nThe character was introduced as one of six new sixth-form students who arrive to study in ''Hollyoaks''.

Gill said that \"George and her dog Thunder are all she has\". This causes tension between Phoebe and George and he decides to move out. Phoebe feels \"guilty\" because George is unwell.

He felt that George is inexperienced in being homeless compared to her; having only been homeless for eight months.<ref name=ds/> In his backstory; George became dependent on Phoebe as his situation became desperate, while in the storyline she is his source for advice on \"what to do and where to go\". However, their friendship leads them into \"quite awkward situations\" where they act as one another's \"lifelines\". When George is around Phoebe he is serious and \"down-to-earth\", which forges a \"brilliant\" friendship. Roberts indicated that this was in stark contrast to his behaviour around his sixth-form friends. George creates a bravado to fit in with them and he pretends all is fine, \"while being quite camp and outrageous\".<ref name=ds/>\n\nIn one scene Callum asks George whether his parents disowned him because he is homosexual. George did not confirm the details of their estrangement. Roberts told Kilkelly that at that point, George does not feel he needs to discuss his family life because he has moved on. Roberts said that the storyline helped convey an insight to why George acts the way he does. As the storyline developed, more details surrounding George are revealed and audience was given the chance to see how George deals with the various situations of homelessness. The storyline became \"a lot darker\" as it became more serious.<ref name=ds/> As the storyline progressed; George and Phoebe are forced to live on the streets after other squatters steal their living space. Roberts said that the squat provided George with a platform to attend college and put up a front. Now he sleeps on cardboard in the streets. Roberts said that George starts to look \"rougher because it's cold, damp and very bleak\". They receive help from [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2012)#Deena Hardman|Deena Hardman]] ([[Sian Breckin]]). Roberts described her as \"very manipulative character and she hasn't got their best interests at heart\".<ref name=ds/>\n\n==Storylines==\nGeorge arrives at Hollyoaks Sixth Form College with his friends Maddie, Tilly, Jono and Neil. George reveals he has crushes on many of the local males and offers advice to his friends. Maddie and Tilly convince George to go on a night out with [[Bart McQueen]] ([[Jonny Clarke]]), Jono and Neil while they have a girl's night. George finds it hard to bond with the guys until he manages to steal a beer pump for the local pub. He tells Maddie that she should get together with Callum. Maddie accuses George of gossiping and lying, and then refuses to include him. Tilly comforts George while he cries in the toilets. George gets a job at the Price Slice shop.\n\nGeorge then begins stealing scraps of food from people when they are not looking. He continues to act secretive and goes to a house where he is squatting. While Maddie is away on holiday, George is paired with Callum in an assignment for General Studies. In the SU Bar, Callum convinces George to buy the drinks to improve his confidence. A group of revellers push George around because he is gay. Callum defends George by fighting the group off. After George refuses to let Callum take him home; he lets George stay at his house. Callum becomes suspicious of George's home life and follows him back to his squat. Callum tries to help George by providing him with food. Phoebe tells Callum not to trust him. Callum spends the night in the squat to find out what George lives like. George falls ill and refuses help from Callum. George chases shoplifters who attack him, he tells Callum he needs the job to survive. When he goes to stay at Callum's again, Maddie nearly catches him. George finds that his squat has been taken over and is scared away. He and Phoebe are forced to live on the streets and beg. Maddie quips George over his messy appearance, which results in him losing his temper with her. He again refuses help from Callum and accepts money from [[Deena Hardman]] ([[Sian Breckin]]). Phoebe is then attacked by a thug.\n\nPhoebe is attacked by a thug and is saved by Deena who takes Phoebe and George back to her home. Phoebe thinks that Deena has an ulterior motive, while George thinks she is being friendly. Phoebe finds a photograph of a missing boy she knows and realises that Deena is involved in human trafficking. Deena and [[Graham Hardman]] ([[Steve Marsh (comedian)|Steve Marsh]]) become violent in their attempts to stop George and Phoebe escaping. George escapes and tells Callum that he thinks Phoebe did not. George later finds Phoebe's bracelet and assumes she is safe. He then agrees to stay at Callum's for a while. George struggles to get along with [[Lacey Kane]] (Georgia Bourke). Phoebe returns and tells George that Deena and Graham are watching him. Phoebe leads George to Deena, who takes him back to her house and locks him up. Phoebe tells him that she betrayed him to save her dog's life. Deena arranges for George to have sex with a man, who turns out to be an under cover police officer. Phoebe and George decide to run away from the police to avoid being sent into care. Maddie and Callum take George to see his parents. George reveals that he was bullied which eventually led to him leaving home. After he threw his old identity off a cliff, George realises that his family presumed that he killed himself. George reveals that his name is actually Andrew Palmer and returns to his parents who are shocked that he is alive. George plans to go to Jono and [[Ruby Button]]'s ([[Anna Shaffer]]) wedding. Maddie steals a mini van and plans to drive them so they can elope to [[Gretna Green]]. They discover the van they have stolen has the wedding cakes from [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]), [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]), [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]) and [[Doug Carter]]'s ([[PJ Brennan]]) double wedding. George feels ill and the sight of the cake makes him feel worse so he switches seats with Neil. On their way to drop the wedding cakes off, Bart and Esther try to drive them off the road so they can stop the wedding. Maddie realises the brakes are not working and has to swerve off the road to avoid [[Leah Barnes]] (Ela-May Demirican). Maddie crashes in to the wedding venue of the double wedding and the car is upturned. Neil is killed. Maddie helps George escape and he helps her free herself. George thanks Maddie for saving his life and then realises that if he had not switches seats with Neil, Neil would not have died. The van explodes and a falling piece of debris kills Maddie.\n\n==Reception==\nFor his portrayal of George, Roberts was nominated for \"Best Actor\" at the 2012 [[British Soap Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=British Soap Awards 2012 voting opens, nominations revealed|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a368040/british-soap-awards-2012-voting-opens-nominations-revealed.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=29 February 2012|date=27 February 2012}}</ref> He was later nominated in the categories of \"Best Actor\" and \"Best Newcomer\" at the 2012 ''[[TV Choice]]'' Awards.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vote Hollyoaks: TV Choice Awards |url=http://www.e4.com/blog/hollyoaks/post/hbpzmexokrtmntomaa2lil/view.e4 |work=[[E4 (channel)|E4.com]] |publisher=([[Channel Four Television Corporation]]) |accessdate=1 June 2012 |date=22 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606014213/http://www.e4.com/blog/hollyoaks/post/hbpzmexokrtmntomaa2lil/view.e4 |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df= }}</ref> At the 2012 [[Inside Soap Awards]] Roberts was nominated for \"Best Newcomer\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Inside Soap Awards 2012 - longlist nominees in full|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a392213/inside-soap-awards-2012-longlist-nominees-in-full.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=9 July 2012|accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnthony D.

He felt that George is inexperienced in being homeless compared to her; having only been homeless for eight months.<ref name=ds/> In his backstory; George became dependent on Phoebe as his situation became desperate, while in the storyline she is his source for advice on \"what to do and where to go\". However, their friendship leads them into \"quite awkward situations\" where they act as one another's \"lifelines\". When George is around Phoebe he is serious and \"down-to-earth\", which forges a \"brilliant\" friendship. Roberts indicated that this was in stark contrast to his behaviour around his sixth-form friends. George creates a bravado to fit in with them and he pretends all is fine, \"while being quite camp and outrageous\".<ref name=ds/>\n\nIn one scene Callum asks George whether his parents disowned him because he is homosexual. George did not confirm the details of their estrangement. Roberts told Kilkelly that at that point, George does not feel he needs to discuss his family life because he has moved on. Roberts said that the storyline helped convey an insight to why George acts the way he does. As the storyline developed, more details surrounding George are revealed and audience was given the chance to see how George deals with the various situations of homelessness. The storyline became \"a lot darker\" as it became more serious.<ref name=ds/> As the storyline progressed; George and Phoebe are forced to live on the streets after other squatters steal their living space. Roberts said that the squat provided George with a platform to attend college and put up a front. Now he sleeps on cardboard in the streets. Roberts said that George starts to look \"rougher because it's cold, damp and very bleak\". They receive help from [[List of Hollyoaks characters (2012)#Deena Hardman|Deena Hardman]] ([[Sian Breckin]]). Roberts described her as \"very manipulative character and she hasn't got their best interests at heart\".<ref name=ds/>\n\n==Storylines==\nGeorge arrives at Hollyoaks Sixth Form College with his friends Maddie, Tilly, Jono and Neil. George reveals he has crushes on many of the local males and offers advice to his friends. Maddie and Tilly convince George to go on a night out with [[Bart McQueen]] ([[Jonny Clarke]]), Jono and Neil while they have a girl\u2019s night. George finds it hard to bond with the guys until he manages to steal a beer pump for the local pub. He tells Maddie that she should get together with Callum. Maddie accuses George of gossiping and lying, and then refuses to include him. Tilly comforts George while he cries in the toilets. George gets a job at the Price Slice shop.\n\nGeorge then begins stealing scraps of food from people when they are not looking. He continues to act secretive and goes to a house where he is squatting. While Maddie is away on holiday, George is paired with Callum in an assignment for General Studies. In the SU Bar, Callum convinces George to buy the drinks to improve his confidence. A group of revellers push George around because he is gay. Callum defends George by fighting the group off. After George refuses to let Callum take him home; he lets George stay at his house. Callum becomes suspicious of George's home life and follows him back to his squat. Callum tries to help George by providing him with food. Phoebe tells Callum not to trust him. Callum spends the night in the squat to find out what George lives like. George falls ill and refuses help from Callum. George chases shoplifters who attack him, he tells Callum he needs the job to survive. When he goes to stay at Callum's again, Maddie nearly catches him. George finds that his squat has been taken over and is scared away. He and Phoebe are forced to live on the streets and beg. Maddie quips George over his messy appearance, which results in him losing his temper with her. He again refuses help from Callum and accepts money from [[Deena Hardman]] ([[Sian Breckin]]). Phoebe is then attacked by a thug.\n\nPhoebe is attacked by a thug and is saved by Deena who takes Phoebe and George back to her home. Phoebe thinks that Deena has an ulterior motive, while George thinks she is being friendly. Phoebe finds a photograph of a missing boy she knows and realises that Deena is involved in human trafficking. Deena and [[Graham Hardman]] ([[Steve Marsh (comedian)|Steve Marsh]]) become violent in their attempts to stop George and Phoebe escaping. George escapes and tells Callum that he thinks Phoebe did not. George later finds Phoebe's bracelet and assumes she is safe. He then agrees to stay at Callum's for a while. George struggles to get along with [[Lacey Kane]] (Georgia Bourke). Phoebe returns and tells George that Deena and Graham are watching him. Phoebe leads George to Deena, who takes him back to her house and locks him up. Phoebe tells him that she betrayed him to save her dog's life. Deena arranges for George to have sex with a man, who turns out to be an under cover police officer. Phoebe and George decide to run away from the police to avoid being sent into care. Maddie and Callum take George to see his parents. George reveals that he was bullied which eventually led to him leaving home. After he threw his old identity off a cliff, George realises that his family presumed that he killed himself. George reveals that his name is actually Andrew Palmer and returns to his parents who are shocked that he is alive. George plans to go to Jono and [[Ruby Button]]'s ([[Anna Shaffer]]) wedding. Maddie steals a mini van and plans to drive them so they can elope to [[Gretna Green]]. They discover the van they have stolen has the wedding cakes from [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]), [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]), [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]) and [[Doug Carter]]'s ([[PJ Brennan]]) double wedding. George feels ill and the sight of the cake makes him feel worse so he switches seats with Neil. On their way to drop the wedding cakes off, Bart and Esther try to drive them off the road so they can stop the wedding. Maddie realises the brakes are not working and has to swerve off the road to avoid [[Leah Barnes]] (Ela-May Demirican). Maddie crashes in to the wedding venue of the double wedding and the car is upturned. Neil is killed. Maddie helps George escape and he helps her free herself. George thanks Maddie for saving his life and then realises that if he had not switches seats with Neil, Neil would not have died. The van explodes and a falling piece of debris kills Maddie.\n\n==Reception==\nFor his portrayal of George, Roberts was nominated for \"Best Actor\" at the 2012 [[British Soap Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=British Soap Awards 2012 voting opens, nominations revealed|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a368040/british-soap-awards-2012-voting-opens-nominations-revealed.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=29 February 2012|date=27 February 2012}}</ref> He was later nominated in the categories of \"Best Actor\" and \"Best Newcomer\" at the 2012 ''[[TV Choice]]'' Awards.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vote Hollyoaks: TV Choice Awards |url=http://www.e4.com/blog/hollyoaks/post/hbpzmexokrtmntomaa2lil/view.e4 |work=[[E4 (channel)|E4.com]] |publisher=([[Channel Four Television Corporation]]) |accessdate=1 June 2012 |date=22 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606014213/http://www.e4.com/blog/hollyoaks/post/hbpzmexokrtmntomaa2lil/view.e4 |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df= }}</ref> At the 2012 [[Inside Soap Awards]] Roberts was nominated for \"Best Newcomer\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Inside Soap Awards 2012 - longlist nominees in full|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/scoop/a392213/inside-soap-awards-2012-longlist-nominees-in-full.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|date=9 July 2012|accessdate=9 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnthony D.

Krems is a city with its own statute (or ''[[Statutory city (Austria)|Statutarstadt]]''), and therefore it is both a municipality and a district.\n\n==Geography==\nKrems is located at the confluence of the [[Krems (Lower Austria)|Krems]] and [[Danube River]]s at the eastern end of [[Wachau]] valley, in the southern [[Waldviertel]].\n\nKrems borders the following municipalities: [[Stratzing]], [[Langenlois]], [[Rohrendorf bei Krems]], [[Gedersdorf]], [[Traismauer]], [[Nu\u00dfdorf ob der Traisen]], [[Paudorf]], [[Furth bei G\u00f6ttweig]], [[Mautern an der Donau]], [[D\u00fcrnstein]], and [[Senftenberg]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Topographia Austriacarum (Merian) 030.jpg|thumb|View of Krems in 1679]]\n[[File:Krems an der Donau 1900.jpg|thumb|View of Krems in 1900]]\n[[File:Krems and mautern from ferdinandswarte.jpg|thumb|View of Krems in 2006]]\n[[File:Stein adD.JPG|thumb|[[Danube]] in Krems with the harbour in background]]\n\nKrems was first mentioned in 995 in a certificate of [[Otto III]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wasserwerk.at/home/wasserwerke/krems|title=Krems an der Donau - Wasserwerk|publisher=}}</ref> but settlement was apparent even before then. For example, a child's grave, over 27,000 years old, was found here. This is the oldest grave found in Austria.\n\nDuring the 11th and 12th centuries, Chremis, as it was then called, was almost as large as Vienna.\n\nKrems is the primary producer of [[Marillenschnaps]], an apricot brandy.\n\nKrems is the hometown of [[Martin Johann Schmidt]], called \"Kremserschmidt\", the leading [[Painting|painter]], [[drawing|draughtsman]] and [[etcher]] of

This is the oldest grave found in Austria.\n\nDuring the 11th and 12th centuries, Chremis, as it was then called, was almost as large as Vienna.\n\nKrems is the primary producer of

In ''Tokyo Babylon'', he appears as a kindly veterinarian often showing romantical affection to the young ''[[onmyoji]]'' [[Subaru Sumeragi]]. However, across the story it is revealed he is the {{nihongo|''Sakurazukamori''|\u685c\u585a\u8b77||lit. \"[[Cherry Blossom]] burial mound guardian\"}}, Japan's number one [[assassination|assassin]] who is targeting Subaru. The character returns in the apocalyptic manga ''[[X (manga)|X]]'' as a combatant in the battle of [[Armageddon]], a [[Dragons of Earth|Dragon of Earth]] and Subaru's rival. An alternate version of him also appears in Clamp's [[fictional crossover|crossover]] series, ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' as a young treasure hunter who is in search of vampires.\n\nSeishir\u014d was created alongside Subaru and his twin sister Hokuto as the main characters for a ''[[d\u014djinshi]]'' novel. After undergoing major changes, he was used as one of the main characters from ''Tokyo Babylon''. Ever since his introduction in ''Tokyo Babylon'' Seishir\u014d has been well received by publications for manga and anime for his relationship with Subaru which would transform into one of the most famous rivalries from ''X''.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== ''Tokyo Babylon'' ===\nIn ''Tokyo Babylon'', Seishir\u014d appears as a [[veterinarian]] working in [[Shinjuku, Tokyo]]. He is friends with the meets up with 16-year-old [[Subaru Sumeragi]], Japan's most powerful ''[[onmy\u014dd\u014d|onmyoji]]'', after the latter's ''shikigami'' causes an unlikely meeting between the two at [[Ikebukuro]] train station. Seishir\u014d begins a year of courtship that will ultimately change both of their lives. Often he professes his love for the boy, with Subaru's eccentric twin sister Hokuto enthusiastically supporting the pairing, much to Subaru's embarrassment.<ref>{{cite book|title=Tokyo Babylon, Volume 1|publisher=Shinshokan|year=1991|isbn=4-403-61250-4|chapter=Vol. 0|author=Clamp}}</ref> Seishir\u014d also protects Subaru on several occasions, even sacrificing his right eye to protect Subaru from a knife-wielding attacker.\n\nThough freely sharing his knowledge of the occult and occasionally using his powers, Seishir\u014d obscures his true identity and personal details. After a year passes and Subaru finally realises his love for Seishir\u014d, but at this point Seishir\u014d reveals he is the ''Sakurazukamori'', Japan's top one assassin. Having become the Sakurazukamori, Seishir\u014d was supposed to kill the young Subaru when being found by him. Impressed with kid's purity, Seishir\u014d made a bet with him: Should Seishir\u014d come to love him after living a year with him he would spare him and otherwise he would kill him. As a result, he almost kills the young ''onmy\u014dji'', but Subaru's grandmother intervenes to free him from the illusion, leaving herself crippled as a result.<ref name=\"final\">{{cite book|title=Tokyo Babylon, Volume 7|publisher=Shinshokan|year=1994|isbn=4-403-61339-X|chapter=Vol. 11|author=Clamp}}</ref>\n\nSeishir\u014d disappears from Subaru's life after this point; Hokuto, fearing that he will come after her brother, offers up her own life in his place. Seishir\u014d accepts and stabs her through the heart; with her last breath, Hokuto casts a spell whose effects would subsequently be revealed in ''X''.<ref name=\"final\"/>\n\n=== ''X'' ===\nAfter leaving Tokyo following the events of ''Tokyo Babylon'', Seishir\u014d returns to the city to assume his place as one of the Dragons of Earth, one of the warriors destined to fight against the Dragons of Heaven to eliminate mankind. He encounters Subaru and other Dragons of Heaven while destroying one of the city's barrier but their fight does not conclude. Though still unemotional, Seishir\u014d makes an unlikely friend with [[F\u016bma Monou]], the most leader of the Dragon of Earth, who while taking one of Subaru's eyes in combat tells him that only Seishir\u014d can grant Subaru's true wish.<ref>{{cite book|title=X, Volume 12|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten|year=1999|isbn=4-04-924770-4|pages=70\u201371|author=Clamp}}</ref>\n\nSeishir\u014d encounters Subaru for one final fight in the Rainbow Bridge. After some time of fighting, Seishir\u014d heads in for the finishing blow.

In the film, the ''Sakurazukamori'' assassinates a former enemy of the Sumeragi clan; however, his signature hand-through-the-chest style of killing is dropped in favor of magically strangling his victims.\n\nIn the crossover manga ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'', Seishiro appears as a young traveler who gained the power to travel between worlds from the witch [[Y\u016bko Ichihara]] in exchange for his right eye. He searches for the vampire twins [[Kamui Shiro|Kamui]] and [[Subaru Sumeragi|Subaru]] and, like his younger brother F\u016bma, he is a treasure hunter.<ref name=\"ch117\">{{cite book |title=Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Volume 16|year= 2008|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapitre 117|isbn=978-0-345-50148-6 }}</ref> Although the reason for searching the vampire twins remains unknown, Kamui states that he will kill Seishir\u014d if he finds them.<ref name=\"ch118\">{{cite book |title=Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Volume 16|year= 2008|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapitre 118|isbn=978-0-345-50148-6 }}</ref> Seishir\u014d possesses one of Sakura's magical feathers which allows him to summon [[Oni (folklore)|oni]] to fight for him as well as modify them into swords he can change their shape.<ref name=\"ch45\">{{cite book|title=Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Volume 7|year=2005|author=Clamp|publisher=[[Del Rey Manga]]|chapter=Chapitre 45|isbn=978-0-345-47797-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/tsubasa70007clam}}</ref><ref name=\"ch48\">{{cite book|title=Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Volume 7|year=2005|author=Clamp|publisher=[[Del Rey Manga]]|chapter=Chapitre 48|isbn=978-0-345-47797-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/tsubasa70007clam}}</ref> An experienced fighter, Seishir\u014d was also the one to teach the dimension traveller [[Syaoran (Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle)|Syaoran]] his kicking techniques.<ref name=\"ch42\">{{cite book |title=Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Volume 6|year= 2005|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapitre 42|isbn= 978-0-345-47793-4 }}</ref> Although he grows happy with his development, Seishir\u014d does not doubt in trying to kill Syaoran in Oto Country when searching for clues about the vampires.<ref name=\"ch45\"/> When coming to Japan to get information about the vampires' location, Seishir\u014d is challenged by the [[List of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle characters#Syaoran|\"other Syaoran\"]] who wishes to obtain his feather.<ref name=\"ch141\">{{cite book |title=Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Volume 22|year= 2009|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapitre 170|isbn= 978-0-345-51038-9 }}</ref> In the course of the battle Syaoran manages to claim the feather,<ref name=\"ch173\">{{cite book |title=Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Volume 22|year= 2009|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapitre 173|isbn= 978-0-345-51038-9 }}</ref> although F\u016bma comments that was his main intention from the start.<ref name=\"ch175\">{{cite book |title=Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Volume 23|year= 2009|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapitre 175|isbn= 978-0-345-51230-7}}</ref> He later leaves Japan to continue his search and is seen in the epilogue alongside his brother and the vampires.\n\n== Creation and conception ==\nSubaru and his twin sister Hokuto, as well as Seishir\u014d, were first conceived by series creator [[Nanase Ohkawa]] for a ''[[d\u014djinshi]]'' novel about an onmy\u014dji who hunts [[elves]], of which only the beginning exists.<ref name = \"Kiseki3\">\"Interview with Clamp: Tokyo Babylon\" in ''[[Clamp no Kiseki]]'', Volume 3.

In the d\u014djinshi, Seishir\u014d was also a veterinarian, but though he had a dark side, it was nowhere near as pronounced. Thus, he was the character who underwent the most change from this early conception to the creation of ''Tokyo Babylon''. Nevertheless, Seishiro was easier to write than Subaru as Clamp was more used to writing dark characters.<ref name = \"Kiseki3\"/>  In the d\u014djinshi, Seishir\u014d's shikigami was named ''Nandaro'' (''\"Just what is this?\"''), and [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]] privately still refer to it by this name.

As they believed Seishir\u014d would actually survive, Clamp made it clear that Seishir\u014d permanently died and would not return in future chapters.<ref name=\"10years\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nSeishir\u014d has been well received by publications for manga and anime.

In ''Tokyo Babylon'', he appears as a kindly veterinarian often showing romantical affection to the young ''[[onmyoji]]'' [[Subaru Sumeragi]]. However, across the story it is revealed he is the {{nihongo|''Sakurazukamori''|\u685c\u585a\u8b77||lit. \"[[Cherry Blossom]] burial mound guardian\"}}, Japan's number one [[assassination|assassin]] who is targeting Subaru. The character returns in the apocalyptic manga ''[[X (manga)|X]]'' as a combatant in the battle of [[Armageddon]], a [[Dragons of Earth|Dragon of Earth]] and Subaru's rival. An alternate version of him also appears in Clamp's [[fictional crossover|crossover]] series, ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' as a young treasure hunter who is in search of vampires.\n\nSeishir\u014d was created alongside Subaru and his twin sister Hokuto as the main characters for a ''[[d\u014djinshi]]'' novel. After undergoing major changes, he was used as one of the main characters from ''Tokyo Babylon''. Ever since his introduction in ''Tokyo Babylon'' Seishir\u014d has been well received by publications for manga and anime for his relationship with Subaru which would transform into one of the most famous rivalries from ''X''.\n\n== Appearances ==\n\n=== ''Tokyo Babylon'' ===\nIn ''Tokyo Babylon'', Seishir\u014d appears as a [[veterinarian]] working in [[Shinjuku, Tokyo]]. He is friends with the meets up with 16-year-old [[Subaru Sumeragi]], Japan's most powerful ''[[onmy\u014dd\u014d|onmyoji]]'', after the latter's ''shikigami'' causes an unlikely meeting between the two at [[Ikebukuro]] train station. Seishir\u014d begins a year of courtship that will ultimately change both of their lives. Often he professes his love for the boy, with Subaru's eccentric twin sister Hokuto enthusiastically supporting the pairing, much to Subaru\u2019s embarrassment.<ref>{{cite book|title=Tokyo Babylon, Volume 1|publisher=Shinshokan|year=1991|isbn=4-403-61250-4|chapter=Vol. 0|author=Clamp}}</ref> Seishir\u014d also protects Subaru on several occasions, even sacrificing his right eye to protect Subaru from a knife-wielding attacker.\n\nThough freely sharing his knowledge of the occult and occasionally using his powers, Seishir\u014d obscures his true identity and personal details. After a year passes and Subaru finally realises his love for Seishir\u014d, but at this point Seishir\u014d reveals he is the ''Sakurazukamori'', Japan's top one assassin. Having become the Sakurazukamori, Seishir\u014d was supposed to kill the young Subaru when being found by him. Impressed with kid's purity, Seishir\u014d made a bet with him: Should Seishir\u014d come to love him after living a year with him he would spare him and otherwise he would kill him. As a result, he almost kills the young ''onmy\u014dji'', but Subaru's grandmother intervenes to free him from the illusion, leaving herself crippled as a result.<ref name=\"final\">{{cite book|title=Tokyo Babylon, Volume 7|publisher=Shinshokan|year=1994|isbn=4-403-61339-X|chapter=Vol. 11|author=Clamp}}</ref>\n\nSeishir\u014d disappears from Subaru's life after this point; Hokuto, fearing that he will come after her brother, offers up her own life in his place. Seishir\u014d accepts and stabs her through the heart; with her last breath, Hokuto casts a spell whose effects would subsequently be revealed in ''X''.<ref name=\"final\"/>\n\n=== ''X'' ===\nAfter leaving Tokyo following the events of ''Tokyo Babylon'', Seishir\u014d returns to the city to assume his place as one of the Dragons of Earth, one of the warriors destined to fight against the Dragons of Heaven to eliminate mankind. He encounters Subaru and other Dragons of Heaven while destroying one of the city's barrier but their fight does not conclude. Though still unemotional, Seishir\u014d makes an unlikely friend with [[F\u016bma Monou]], the most leader of the Dragon of Earth, who while taking one of Subaru's eyes in combat tells him that only Seishir\u014d can grant Subaru's true wish.<ref>{{cite book|title=X, Volume 12|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten|year=1999|isbn=4-04-924770-4|pages=70\u201371|author=Clamp}}</ref>\n\nSeishir\u014d encounters Subaru for one final fight in the Rainbow Bridge. After some time of fighting, Seishir\u014d heads in for the finishing blow. Hokuto's final spell takes effect, leaving Subaru with his hand through Seishir\u014d's chest, killing the Sakurazukamori instead.<ref>{{cite book|title=X, Volume 16|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten|year=2002|isbn=4-04-924857-3|pages=74\u201375|author=Clamp}}</ref> Hokuto's final wish was Subaru could not be killed the same way she was.

In the film, the ''Sakurazukamori'' assassinates a former enemy of the Sumeragi clan; however, his signature hand-through-the-chest style of killing is dropped in favor of magically strangling his victims.\n\nIn the crossover manga ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'', Seishiro appears as a young traveler who gained the power to travel between worlds from the witch [[Y\u016bko Ichihara]] in exchange for his right eye.

In the d\u014djinshi, Seishir\u014d was also a veterinarian, but though he had a dark side, it was nowhere near as pronounced. Thus, he was the character who underwent the most change from this early conception to the creation of ''Tokyo Babylon''. Nevertheless, Seishiro was easier to write than Subaru as Clamp was more used to writing dark characters.<ref name = \"Kiseki3\"/>  In the d\u014djinshi, Seishir\u014d's shikigami was named ''Nandaro'' (''\"Just what is this?\"''), and [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]] privately still refer to it by this name.
