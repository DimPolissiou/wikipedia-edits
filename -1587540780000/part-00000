Sited opposite [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]], the synagogue extends to [[Castlereagh Street, Sydney|Castlereagh Street]]. It was designed by [[Thomas Rowe]] and built from 1874 to 1878, with stonework by Aaron Loveridge. The synagogue was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 10 September 2004.<ref name=nswshr-1710>{{cite NSW SHR|5051584|Great Synagogue|hr=01710|fn=H00/00591,S90/06045|accessdate=14 October 2018}}</ref> The building is also listed on the (now defunct) [[Register of the National Estate]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Heritage of Australia |publisher=Macmillan Company |year=1981 |page=2 |location= |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Great Synagogue was built to unite two Jewish congregations in Sydney which worshipped at the time in synagogues in [[York Street, Sydney|York Street]] and [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]]. The York Street Synagogue had been designed in the [[Egyptian Revival]] style<ref>{{cite journal |author-link=Diana Muir |author=Muir Appelbaum, Diana |title=Jewish Identity and Egyptian Revival Architecture |journal=Journal of Jewish Identities |year=2012 |volume=5 |number=2 |page=7 }}</ref> by [[James Hume (architect)|James Hume]] and built in 1844.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.greatsynagogue.org.au/history.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907140812/http://www.greatsynagogue.org.au/history.html |archive-date=7 September 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The first moves were made in 1864 towards obtaining a suitable site for a new, larger synagogue. In 1871 a meeting was held at York Street to discuss buying land available in [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]]. It was suggested a meeting be held with the Macquarie Street Synagogue to unite in purchasing the land for a synagogue to serve the whole community. John Solomon, a builder, purchased the land at auction for {{Australian pound|2,000}} in 1871 and held it until the congregation could raise sufficient funds. The proposal was for a synagogue and educational facilities for the less wealthy members of the congregation. The money was to be raised by sale of land in Kent Street which had been granted for a Jewish school but never used. Further money was raised by the sale of the York and Macquarie Street properties. An appeal was also launched to fund the new building, accompanied by a photograph of the New London Synagogue (subsequently destroyed by bombing in 1941) which was intended to serve as the model for the Sydney building. [[Thomas Rowe]], a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] architect, was selected in 1872 by means of a limited competition, the other competitors being G. A. Mansfield and [[Benjamin Backhouse]]. Rowe also acted as the construction manager for the new building. The building of the synagogue was also partly supervised by the [[Princes Road Synagogue]], Liverpool and the [[New West End Synagogue]], London. The foundation stone was laid in January 1875 by [[Saul Samuel]], [[Postmaster-General of New South Wales|Postmaster General]], later to be the first Jewish minister of the Crown in the British Empire. A huge bazaar was held in December 1875 to raise extra funds.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\nThe principal contractor for stonework was Aaron Loveridge, founder of the modern firm of Loveridge & Hudson. The contract drawings by Rowe, and signed by Loveridge, are held by Sydney's [[Mitchell Library]]. Other notable firms connected with the work were William Coleman (carpentry and joinery), Fletcher Brothers (decorative cast iron), Lewis and Steel (decorative plaster), Cornelius and Co of Philadelphia (gas fixtures), Minton Hollins & Co (tiles), P. N. Russell & Co (cast iron columns), and Lyon & Cottier (stained and etched glass).<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\nThe synagogue was consecrated on 4 March 1878, but its decoration was not completed until 1883.<ref name=nswshr-1710-1710-1>Phillips, 1975.</ref><ref name=nswshr-1710-1710-2>Bersten, 1995.</ref> At the time of completion the synagogue was the most imposing building in Elizabeth Street and was one of the first large Victorian buildings erected in Sydney and reflected civic pride and prosperity. The Great Synagogue is the mother synagogue of Australian Jewry and still maintains a register of all births, marriages and deaths which have taken place since the first entry was made on 1 November 1826. It also houses a museum which attracts much interest as does the library. The synagogue is involved with festivals in Sydney including the Festival of Sydney and the 1986 \"Music on the Move\" program. In 1988 the Bicentennial Council of NSW recognised the importance of the building and recommended a significant grant for restoration work on the Elizabeth Street facade. Each year many tourists visit the synagogue which features prominently in guidebooks as well as special interest groups, especially schools.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe Great Synagogue combines elements of [[Byzantine style]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] characteristics.<ref>[http://www.greatsynagogue.org.au \"Welcome to the Great Synagogue, Sydney\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218001009/http://www.greatsynagogue.org.au/ |date=18 February 2008 }}, [http://www.greatsynagogue.org.au/Visiting.html \"Visiting The Great Synagogue, Sydney\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319023032/http://www.greatsynagogue.org.au/Visiting.html |date=19 March 2008 }}, 19 February 2008.</ref> This grand building is often described as the \"cathedral synagogue\" of Australia.\n\nThe Great Synagogue consists of two main sections: the original synagogue (house of worship) with ladies' gallery, at the Elizabeth Street end, and a five-storey modern section at the Castlereagh Street end behind the [[facade]] of the original Beadle's residence. The original eclectic design in Victorian Free Gothic style was described at the time of consecration as Byzantine interspersed with Gothic elements. The Elizabeth Street frontage and towers are of Pyrmont stone, and the remainder of the early structure is brick with cast-iron columns and timber floors, and a slate roof. The Castlereagh Street facade is stone at ground floor level, with rendered [[brickwork]] above. The interior is elaborately decorated with moulded plaster, carved timber and stained glass, all embellished with abstract patterns to avoid representation of living forms. Surviving timber stairs at the Elizabeth Street end have strongly carved [[balustrade]]s. Walls are painted with gold leaf highlights, and the furniture is mostly of polished timber and brass. Some original colour schemes survive, notably on the ceiling of the Elizabeth Street [[porch]], while the midnight blue ceiling with gold leaf stars has been repainted to the original design several times. Timber floors are raked at both ground and gallery levels, and the centre section of the ground floor and Ark steps, like the porch, are ornately tiled in tessellated and [[mosaic]] work. The basement contains a hall which has steel portal frames supporting the columns and floor above, and also contains the A M Rosenblum Museum and Rabbi Falk Library. The modern section, constructed of reinforced concrete, contains offices, classrooms and meeting rooms, together with a lift and fire stairs, and has a top floor with an openable roof. The modern stained glass windows in the Castlereagh Street facade were designed by Louis Kahan of Melbourne. The building contains notable examples of venerable sacred scrolls and religious artefacts, including a menorah (nine-branched candelabrum) made by Rabbi L. A. Falk.<ref name=nswshr-1710-1710-1/><ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\nThe present synagogue has the traditional feature of an elevated ladies' gallery. When first erected, the [[Bema#Judaism|bimah]] was central, as is traditional. However, to increase seating capacity the bimah was moved forward to the western wall in 1906. Over the years, extensive additions and alterations have been made to the other facilities appurtenant to this building, including the construction of a [[succah]], excavation and construction of a large reception area below the synagogue itself, construction of the Rabbi Falk Memorial Library, installation of electricity in the chandeliers, and installation of a \"[[shabbat]]\" elevator. A useful overview of the synagogue's history is provided by the 2008 book edited by [[Raymond Apple (rabbi)|Rabbi Raymond Apple]].<ref name=apple>{{cite book |editor=Apple, Raymond |editor-link=Raymond Apple (rabbi) |title=The Great Synagogue: A History of Sydney's Big Shule |publisher=UNSW Press |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 22 August 2001, the condition of the building is generally good, although the upper sections of stonework require maintenance (1997). There is unlikely to be much archaeological potential owing to the excavations for new sections of the building in the 1950s and 1980s.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\nThe Great Synagogue is generally intact both externally and internally in the older section fronting Elizabeth Street.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\n*1911{{spaced endash}}choir gallery moved from east to west end, western semi-circular apse made square, reading desk moved from centre to western end and rebuilt to incorporate pulpit, and extra seats installed in centre block.

The Great Synagogue is associated with the Mother Congregation of Australian Jewry, together with many subsequent leading members and families of the Jewish faith. By its prominent situation and presence in Central Sydney, its magnificent architectural grandeur, its rich symbolism, and its important collection of Hebrew documents and other religious artefacts, the Great Synagogue also embodies and demonstrates the early development and importance of the Jewish faith and culture in New South Wales during the 19th Century.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\nThe Great Synagogue is a major landmark of Sydney. It is the only high Victorian style Synagogue in Australia and represents one of the most elaborately decorated Victorian buildings in Sydney, internally and externally. The building also represents one of the finest works of the leading NSW architect, Thomas Rowe. It contains excellent examples of the best quality decorative work in moulded plaster, carved sandstone and timber, metalwork, tiling and stained glass that is remarkable for its richness, originality and the degree of craftsmanship by leading decorative firms of the High Victorian period from Australia, Great Britain and the United States. Apart from its architectural excellence, the Great Synagogue provides a rich townscape aspect to [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] and is an iconic building of Elizabeth and Castlereagh Streets.<ref name=nswshr-1710-1710-4>Phillips, 2000.</ref><ref name=nswshr-1710/><ref>Heritage Office, 2004.</ref>\n\nGreat Synagogue was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 10 September 2004 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Great Synagogue is the earliest surviving synagogue in NSW still in use, and according to some, the earliest surviving synagogue building. A small building in [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], possibly used as a synagogue, was built some years earlier. The Great Synagogue has considerable ecclesiastical and historic importance as it represents the Mother Congregation of Australian Jewry, which saw the merger of two separate congregations to build the present synagogue, and represents the centre of Jewish worship and culture in central Sydney since the 1870s.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nThe Great Synagogue is associated with the mother congregation of Australian Jewry, and many leading citizens and families of the Jewish faith. It is also associated with the prominent architect Thomas Rowe, who designed several other landmark buildings in Sydney of which perhaps the best known is [[Sydney Hospital]] in Macquarie Street.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Great Synagogue is a major landmark of Sydney and represents one of the most elaborately decorated Victorian buildings in Sydney, internally and externally. It contains excellent examples of the best quality work in moulded plaster, carved stone, decorative tiling and stained glass. According to George Proudman, former master mason with the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Department]], the Synagogue has some of the finest stone carving in all of Sydney. The form and construction of the building exemplify the traditional 19th century pattern of Orthodox Anglo-Jewish worship.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\nThe building represents one of the finest works of the leading NSW architect, Thomas Rowe, in association with the architect W. L. Vernon (then in private practice) reputed to have partly supervised Thomas Rowe in the design. The design is reputed to be inspired by the Princes Road Synagogue in Liverpool and the New West End Synagogue in London - a composite Renaissance style, mainly Byzantine but with Gothic overtones, particularly apparent for the main window.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe Great Synagogue is socially significant because it continues to be the focus of Jewish communal worship and culture in central Sydney, as it has been since its construction.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Great Synagogue has technical and research significance as a living museum of decorative embellishment in 19th century buildings, which contains examples of the work of many leading practitioners of the time. It also contains a number of religious scrolls, books and artefacts. The form and construction of the building exemplify the traditional 19th century pattern of Orthodox Anglo-Jewish worship.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Great Synagogue is remarkable for its richness and originality of decoration, coupled with the excellence of the craftsmanship. It is rare in NSW as the earliest surviving synagogue in NSW still in use, and according to some, the earliest surviving synagogue building.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nBy its prominent situation and presence in Central Sydney, its magnificent architectural grandeur, its rich symbolism, and its important collection of Hebrew documents and other religious artefacts, the Great Synagogue also embodies and demonstrates the early development and importance of the Jewish faith and culture in New South Wales during the 19th Century. The Great Synagoue has represented the centre of Jewish worship and culture in Sydney (and arguably the State) since its construction in the 1870s. Architecturally, the Great Synagogue represents one of the finest works of the leading NSW architect, Thomas Rowe, and the most elaborately decorated Victorian building in Sydney.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nThe Great Synagogue in Sydney, bimah.JPG|[[Bema|Bimah]] of The Great Synagogue\nGreat Synagogue, Sydney Detail.jpg|Architectural detail.

district]], in the [[City of Sydney]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. Sited opposite [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]], the synagogue extends to [[Castlereagh Street, Sydney|Castlereagh Street]]. It was designed by [[Thomas Rowe]] and built from 1874 to 1878, with stonework by Aaron Loveridge. The synagogue was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 10 September 2004.<ref name=nswshr-1710>{{cite NSW SHR|5051584|Great Synagogue|hr=01710|fn=H00/00591,S90/06045|accessdate=14 October 2018}}</ref> The building is also listed on the (now defunct) [[Register of the National Estate]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Heritage of Australia |publisher=Macmillan Company |year=1981 |page=2 |location= |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Great Synagogue was built to unite two Jewish congregations in Sydney which worshipped at the time in synagogues in [[York Street, Sydney|York Street]] and [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]]. The York Street Synagogue had been designed in the [[Egyptian Revival]] style<ref>{{cite journal |author-link=Diana Muir |author=Muir Appelbaum, Diana |title=Jewish Identity and Egyptian Revival Architecture |journal=Journal of Jewish Identities |year=2012 |volume=5 |number=2 |page=7 }}</ref> by [[James Hume (architect)|James Hume]] and built in 1844.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.greatsynagogue.org.au/history.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907140812/http://www.greatsynagogue.org.au/history.html |archive-date=7 September 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The first moves were made in 1864 towards obtaining a suitable site for a new, larger synagogue. In 1871 a meeting was held at York Street to discuss buying land available in [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]]. It was suggested a meeting be held with the Macquarie Street Synagogue to unite in purchasing the land for a synagogue to serve the whole community. John Solomon, a builder, purchased the land at auction for {{Australian pound|2,000}} in 1871 and held it until the congregation could raise sufficient funds. The proposal was for a synagogue and educational facilities for the less wealthy members of the congregation. The money was to be raised by sale of land in Kent Street which had been granted for a Jewish school but never used. Further money was raised by the sale of the York and Macquarie Street properties. An appeal was also launched to fund the new building, accompanied by a photograph of the New London Synagogue (subsequently destroyed by bombing in 1941) which was intended to serve as the model for the Sydney building. [[Thomas Rowe]], a [[Cornwall|Cornish]] architect, was selected in 1872 by means of a limited competition, the other competitors being G. A. Mansfield and [[Benjamin Backhouse]]. Rowe also acted as the construction manager for the new building. The building of the synagogue was also partly supervised by the [[Princes Road Synagogue]], Liverpool and the [[New West End Synagogue]], London. The foundation stone was laid in January 1875 by [[Saul Samuel]], [[Postmaster-General of New South Wales|Postmaster General]], later to be the first Jewish minister of the Crown in the British Empire. A huge bazaar was held in December 1875 to raise extra funds.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\nThe principal contractor for stonework was Aaron Loveridge, founder of the modern firm of Loveridge & Hudson. The contract drawings by Rowe, and signed by Loveridge, are held by Sydney's [[Mitchell Library]]. Other notable firms connected with the work were William Coleman (carpentry and joinery), Fletcher Brothers (decorative cast iron), Lewis and Steel (decorative plaster), Cornelius and Co of Philadelphia (gas fixtures), Minton Hollins & Co (tiles), P. N. Russell & Co (cast iron columns), and Lyon & Cottier (stained and etched glass).<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\nThe synagogue was consecrated on 4 March 1878, but its decoration was not completed until 1883.<ref name=nswshr-1710-1710-1>Phillips, 1975.</ref><ref name=nswshr-1710-1710-2>Bersten, 1995.</ref> At the time of completion the synagogue was the most imposing building in Elizabeth Street and was one of the first large Victorian buildings erected in Sydney and reflected civic pride and prosperity. The Great Synagogue is the mother synagogue of Australian Jewry and still maintains a register of all births, marriages and deaths which have taken place since the first entry was made on 1 November 1826. It also houses a museum which attracts much interest as does the library. The synagogue is involved with festivals in Sydney including the Festival of Sydney and the 1986 \"Music on the Move\" program. In 1988 the Bicentennial Council of NSW recognised the importance of the building and recommended a significant grant for restoration work on the Elizabeth Street facade. Each year many tourists visit the synagogue which features prominently in guidebooks as well as special interest groups, especially schools.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe Great Synagogue combines elements of [[Byzantine style]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] characteristics.<ref>[http://www.greatsynagogue.org.au \"Welcome to the Great Synagogue, Sydney\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218001009/http://www.greatsynagogue.org.au/ |date=18 February 2008 }}, [http://www.greatsynagogue.org.au/Visiting.html \"Visiting The Great Synagogue, Sydney\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319023032/http://www.greatsynagogue.org.au/Visiting.html |date=19 March 2008 }}, 19 February 2008.</ref> This grand building is often described as the \"cathedral synagogue\" of Australia.\n\nThe Great Synagogue consists of two main sections: the original synagogue (house of worship) with ladies' gallery, at the Elizabeth Street end, and a five-storey modern section at the Castlereagh Street end behind the [[facade]] of the original Beadle's residence. The original eclectic design in Victorian Free Gothic style was described at the time of consecration as Byzantine interspersed with Gothic elements. The Elizabeth Street frontage and towers are of Pyrmont stone, and the remainder of the early structure is brick with cast-iron columns and timber floors, and a slate roof. The Castlereagh Street facade is stone at ground floor level, with rendered [[brickwork]] above. The interior is elaborately decorated with moulded plaster, carved timber and stained glass, all embellished with abstract patterns to avoid representation of living forms. Surviving timber stairs at the Elizabeth Street end have strongly carved [[balustrade]]s. Walls are painted with gold leaf highlights, and the furniture is mostly of polished timber and brass. Some original colour schemes survive, notably on the ceiling of the Elizabeth Street [[porch]], while the midnight blue ceiling with gold leaf stars has been repainted to the original design several times. Timber floors are raked at both ground and gallery levels, and the centre section of the ground floor and Ark steps, like the porch, are ornately tiled in tessellated and [[mosaic]] work. The basement contains a hall which has steel portal frames supporting the columns and floor above, and also contains the A M Rosenblum Museum and Rabbi Falk Library. The modern section, constructed of reinforced concrete, contains offices, classrooms and meeting rooms, together with a lift and fire stairs, and has a top floor with an openable roof. The modern stained glass windows in the Castlereagh Street facade were designed by Louis Kahan of Melbourne. The building contains notable examples of venerable sacred scrolls and religious artefacts, including a menorah (nine-branched candelabrum) made by Rabbi L. A. Falk.<ref name=nswshr-1710-1710-1/><ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\nThe present synagogue has the traditional feature of an elevated ladies' gallery. When first erected, the [[Bema#Judaism|bimah]] was central, as is traditional. However, to increase seating capacity the bimah was moved forward to the western wall in 1906. Over the years, extensive additions and alterations have been made to the other facilities appurtenant to this building, including the construction of a [[succah]], excavation and construction of a large reception area below the synagogue itself, construction of the Rabbi Falk Memorial Library, installation of electricity in the chandeliers, and installation of a \"[[shabbat]]\" elevator. A useful overview of the synagogue's history is provided by the 2008 book edited by [[Raymond Apple (rabbi)|Rabbi Raymond Apple]].<ref name=apple>{{cite book |editor=Apple, Raymond |editor-link=Raymond Apple (rabbi) |title=The Great Synagogue: A History of Sydney's Big Shule |publisher=UNSW Press |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 22 August 2001, the condition of the building is generally good, although the upper sections of stonework require maintenance (1997). There is unlikely to be much archaeological potential owing to the excavations for new sections of the building in the 1950s and 1980s.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\nThe Great Synagogue is generally intact both externally and internally in the older section fronting Elizabeth Street.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\n*1911{{spaced endash}}choir gallery moved from east to west end, western semi-circular apse made square, reading desk moved from centre to western end and rebuilt to incorporate pulpit, and extra seats installed in centre block.

The Great Synagogue is associated with the Mother Congregation of Australian Jewry, together with many subsequent leading members and families of the Jewish faith. By its prominent situation and presence in Central Sydney, its magnificent architectural grandeur, its rich symbolism, and its important collection of Hebrew documents and other religious artefacts, the Great Synagogue also embodies and demonstrates the early development and importance of the Jewish faith and culture in New South Wales during the 19th Century.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\nThe Great Synagogue is a major landmark of Sydney. It is the only high Victorian style Synagogue in Australia and represents one of the most elaborately decorated Victorian buildings in Sydney, internally and externally. The building also represents one of the finest works of the leading NSW architect, Thomas Rowe. It contains excellent examples of the best quality decorative work in moulded plaster, carved sandstone and timber, metalwork, tiling and stained glass that is remarkable for its richness, originality and the degree of craftsmanship by leading decorative firms of the High Victorian period from Australia, Great Britain and the United States. Apart from its architectural excellence, the Great Synagogue provides a rich townscape aspect to [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] and is an iconic building of Elizabeth and Castlereagh Streets.<ref name=nswshr-1710-1710-4>Phillips, 2000.</ref><ref name=nswshr-1710/><ref>Heritage Office, 2004.</ref>\n\nGreat Synagogue was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 10 September 2004 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Great Synagogue is the earliest surviving synagogue in NSW still in use, and according to some, the earliest surviving synagogue building. A small building in [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]], possibly used as a synagogue, was built some years earlier. The Great Synagogue has considerable ecclesiastical and historic importance as it represents the Mother Congregation of Australian Jewry, which saw the merger of two separate congregations to build the present synagogue, and represents the centre of Jewish worship and culture in central Sydney since the 1870s.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nThe Great Synagogue is associated with the mother congregation of Australian Jewry, and many leading citizens and families of the Jewish faith. It is also associated with the prominent architect Thomas Rowe, who designed several other landmark buildings in Sydney of which perhaps the best known is [[Sydney Hospital]] in Macquarie Street.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Great Synagogue is a major landmark of Sydney and represents one of the most elaborately decorated Victorian buildings in Sydney, internally and externally. It contains excellent examples of the best quality work in moulded plaster, carved stone, decorative tiling and stained glass. According to George Proudman, former master mason with the [[NSW Public Works|NSW Public Works Department]], the Synagogue has some of the finest stone carving in all of Sydney. The form and construction of the building exemplify the traditional 19th century pattern of Orthodox Anglo-Jewish worship.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\nThe building represents one of the finest works of the leading NSW architect, Thomas Rowe, in association with the architect W. L. Vernon (then in private practice) reputed to have partly supervised Thomas Rowe in the design. The design is reputed to be inspired by the Princes Road Synagogue in Liverpool and the New West End Synagogue in London - a composite Renaissance style, mainly Byzantine but with Gothic overtones, particularly apparent for the main window.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe Great Synagogue is socially significant because it continues to be the focus of Jewish communal worship and culture in central Sydney, as it has been since its construction.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Great Synagogue has technical and research significance as a living museum of decorative embellishment in 19th century buildings, which contains examples of the work of many leading practitioners of the time. It also contains a number of religious scrolls, books and artefacts. The form and construction of the building exemplify the traditional 19th century pattern of Orthodox Anglo-Jewish worship.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Great Synagogue is remarkable for its richness and originality of decoration, coupled with the excellence of the craftsmanship. It is rare in NSW as the earliest surviving synagogue in NSW still in use, and according to some, the earliest surviving synagogue building.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nBy its prominent situation and presence in Central Sydney, its magnificent architectural grandeur, its rich symbolism, and its important collection of Hebrew documents and other religious artefacts, the Great Synagogue also embodies and demonstrates the early development and importance of the Jewish faith and culture in New South Wales during the 19th Century. The Great Synagoue has represented the centre of Jewish worship and culture in Sydney (and arguably the State) since its construction in the 1870s. Architecturally, the Great Synagogue represents one of the finest works of the leading NSW architect, Thomas Rowe, and the most elaborately decorated Victorian building in Sydney.<ref name=nswshr-1710/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nThe Great Synagogue in Sydney, bimah.JPG|[[Bema|Bimah]] of The Great Synagogue\nGreat Synagogue, Sydney Detail.jpg|Architectural detail.

It is the [[List of highest-grossing Pakistani films|28th highest-grossing Pakistani film]]. It received mixed to negative reviews from critics.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|section|date=April 2019}}\nThe film opens during the year [[1965]], where two Pakistani [[F-86 Sabre]] fighters are doing a CAP (Combat Air Patrol). Squadron Leader Sikandar and his wingman spot three Indian [[Folland Gnat]] fighters flying in Pakistani airspace. The PAF ([[Pakistan Air Force]]) planes engage the IAF ([[Indian Air Force]]) fighters. Sikandar takes out one Gnat with his guns and the second with a missile. The third Gnat gets behind Sikander's wingman and prepares to shoot him down. Sikandar tries to shoot down the final Gnat with his guns but can't as they become jammed. Rather than see his wingman shot down, Sikandar heroically gives up his life and crashes his plane into the enemy jet.\n\nThe film jumps to present day showing a young man, Haris Mustafa ([[Mikaal Zulfiqar]]) who is the grandson of Sikandar Mustafa, and his best friend Fawad both dreaming of becoming fighter pilots. Haris's parents are disapproving of his career choice, especially his father who is a wealthy businessman. However, Haris's grandmother, widow of Sikander, is supportive of his ambitions. When Haris is accepted into the PAF academy, his father disowns him. Haris, Fawad and two of their newfound friends Harijeet, a Pakistani Sikh and Irfan, a goofy character who endures a lot of ridicule from his instructors and seniors. During this time Haris meets and falls in love with Sabrina ([[Armeena Khan]]) and tries to pursue her. \n\n2 Indian [[Mirage 2000]]'s then intrude into Pakistani airspace and Harris and Irfan are scrambled to intercept them in [[JF-17]]'s. Irfan shoots down one Mirage with a missile, but is forced away due to debris entering his engine. Haris engages in an intense dogfight with the remaining Mirage, but barely escapes with his life. The Mirage escapes and Haris returns to base where he learns his grandmother passed away and that he was not home for her final days due to his duties. Although Haris survived the air encounter with his plane and was successful, his superiors are disappointed with him in almost losing his plane and life. They are very reluctant to send him to the International Flight School.\n\nAt the flight school, he encounters Flight Lieutenant Arun Veerani, a Mirage 2000 fighter pilot. Haris and Arun are initially very hostile to each other, but are then forced to work together when they are disciplined. Arun falls in love with Sarah Francis while Haris encounters Sabrina. They all undergo experiences and misadventures with certain gangsters in Dubai which help all of them becoming more friendly with each other and end up saving each other's lives. Haris wins the international flight school competition for Pakistan and he and Arun depart on friendly terms.\n\nHaris returns and proposes to Sabrina. She agrees to marry him, but only if he remains with the PAF, as she realizes that she cannot let him give up his dream and passion for serving his country. Their honeymoon is cut short when political tensions once again arise between India and Pakistan, with the Indian armed forces threatening to perform surgical strikes along the Pakistan-controlled Kashmir area. Sabrina is horrified at the risk that Harris's life will be in, but he states that he must do what is required of him, to which she then gives him her full support.\n\nHarris and Irfan are sent on a CAP when suddenly they encounter 2 Indian Mirage-2000's again. A missile locks onto Harris's plane and he tries to evade it and does so successfully. Another missile is fired at Harris and they realise there are two more Mirage aircraft behind them, meaning they are outnumbered four to two. After pulling a previously practised manoeuvre, he and Irfan evade the missile and cause it to hit one of the Mirages they were pursuing. Irfan then goes after the second mirage while Harris performs a steep climb to lead the other two mirages away. When they reach a very high altitude, Harris is able to get behind one of the Mirages and shoots it down. Harris then comes face to face with the remaining Mirage who he realises is being flown by Arun. Now, forced to fight with each other, Harris and Arun engage in a dogfight with Harris ending up in the dominant position. Harris then hesitates about shooting Arun down due to their friendship, and then hears a distress call from his wingman Irfan who is now being shot at by the Mirage he was pursuing. Harris spares Arun and tells him to leave the area and flies towards Irfan, but is too late. Harris returns to Arun again who tells him that this decision is \"out of his hands\" and up to his superiors and tries to shoot Harris down. Harris performs a steep climb and Arun follows and is about to shoot down Harris, but loses him in the heavy clouds. Harris then comes up behind him, says \"Sorry my friend\" and shoots Arun's plane down. Upon his return, Harris is greeted by all the PAF ground personnel and his superiors and finds that Irfan has survived as well. To his surprise, his father is there to receive him too and is very proud of the way his son defended his country.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Mikaal Zulfiqar]] as Harris\n* [[Hassan Niazi (actor)|Hassan Niazi]] as Arun Verani\n* [[Armeena Rana Khan]] as Sabrina\n* [[Samina Ahmad]]\n* [[Sabeeka Imam]]\n* [[Laila Zuberi]]\n* Ibrahim Alavi\n\n== Release ==\nThe film was released on 22 March 2019.\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Box office ===\n''Sherdil'' collected around 1.15 crore on the first day, adding 1.7 crore and 1.3 crore on Saturday and Sunday, respectively, reaching up to 4.15 crore by the end of opening weekend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/magazine/instep-today/448921-laal-kabootar-and-sherdil-generate-decent-numbers-at-box-office|title=Laal Kabootar and Sherdil generate decent numbers at box office|last=NewsBytes|website=www.thenews.com.pk|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dunyanews.tv/en/Entertainment/484447-Sherdil-raked-5-crores-first-five-days|title=Sherdil rakes in RS5 crores in first five days|website=Dunya News}}</ref> After 17 days it collected 9.50 crores.<ref>Zaryan Khawar (9 April 2019), [https://galaxylollywood.com/2019/04/09/box-office-captain-marvel/ \"Box Office: \u2018Captain Marvel\u2019 brings in some respite to our rather empty cinemas\"], ''Galaxy Lollywood''.

It is the [[List of highest-grossing Pakistani films|28th highest-grossing Pakistani film]]. It received mixed to negative reviews from critics.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|section|date=April 2019}}\nThe film opens during the year [[1965]], where two Pakistani [[F-86 Sabre]] fighters are doing a CAP (Combat Air Patrol). Squadron Leader Sikandar and his wingman spot three Indian [[Folland Gnat]] fighters flying in Pakistani airspace. The PAF ([[Pakistan Air Force]]) planes engage the IAF ([[Indian Air Force]]) fighters. Sikandar takes out one Gnat with his guns and the second with a missile. The third Gnat gets behind Sikander's wingman and prepares to shoot him down. Sikandar tries to shoot down the final Gnat with his guns but can't as they become jammed. Rather than see his wingman shot down, Sikandar heroically gives up his life and crashes his plane into the enemy jet.\n\nThe film jumps to present day showing a young man, Haris Mustafa ([[Mikaal Zulfiqar]]) who is the grandson of Sikandar Mustafa, and his best friend Fawad both dreaming of becoming fighter pilots. Haris's parents are disapproving of his career choice, especially his father who is a wealthy businessman. However, Haris's grandmother, widow of Sikander, is supportive of his ambitions. When Haris is accepted into the PAF academy, his father disowns him. Haris, Fawad and two of their newfound friends Harijeet, a Pakistani Sikh and Irfan, a goofy character who endures a lot of ridicule from his instructors and seniors.
