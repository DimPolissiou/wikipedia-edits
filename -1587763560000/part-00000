''The Sims 2'', like its predecessor, does not have a defined final goal; the gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]. Sims have life goals, wants and fears, the fulfillment of which can produce both positive or negative outcomes. All Sims age, and can live to 90 sim days depending on the degree to which their aspirations are fulfilled. ''The Sims 2'' builds on its predecessor by allowing Sims to age through six stages of life and incorporating a [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] engine. Although gameplay is not linear, storylines exist in the game's pre-built neighborhoods. Pleasantview is based 25 years after the town in the original ''The Sims''. Strangetown's storyline is based on the supernatural, and is loosely connected with Pleasantview. Veronaville's characters are based on [[Shakespearean]] characters.\n\n''The Sims 2'' was released on September 14, 2004 for Microsoft Windows. A [[Porting|port]] to [[macOS]] was released on June 17, 2005. Eight expansion packs and nine stuff packs were subsequently released. In addition several console versions have been released. ''The Sims 2'' is offered on mobile platforms, with manufacturers such as Nokia offering ''The Sims 2'' from the [[Ovi store|Ovi Store]]. A sequel, ''[[The Sims 3]]'', was released in June 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thorsen|first=Tor|title=Sims 3, next-gen Black, new SimCity & LOTR coming|url=http://au.gamespot.com/news/sims-3-next-gen-black-new-simcity-and-lotr-coming-6160951|accessdate=September 24, 2013|newspaper=GameSpot|date=November 2, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001183949/http://au.gamespot.com/news/sims-3-next-gen-black-new-simcity-and-lotr-coming-6160951|archivedate=October 1, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Orry|first=James|title=Three new Sims games in development|url=http://www.videogamer.com/pc/sims_2/news/three_new_sims_games_in_development.html|accessdate=September 24, 2013|newspaper=VideoGamer.com|date=November 3, 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927080944/http://www.videogamer.com/pc/sims_2/news/three_new_sims_games_in_development.html|archivedate=September 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n''The Sims 2'' was a commercial success, selling one million copies in its first ten days, a record at the time.<ref name=\"Fahey, Rob\">{{cite news|last=Fahey|first=Rob|title=The Sims 2 sells a million, smashes EA records|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/the-sims-2-sells-a-million-smashes-ea-records|accessdate=September 24, 2013|newspaper=[[Eurogamer|GamesIndustry International]]|date=September 27, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028040610/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/the-sims-2-sells-a-million-smashes-ea-records|archivedate=October 28, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  During April 2008, ''The Sims 2'' website announced that 100 million copies of ''The Sims'' series had been sold.<ref name=\"The Sims 2.com - 100 Million Sold\">{{cite web|url=http://thesims2.ea.com/100million/index.php|title=The Sims 2.com - 100 Million Sold|publisher=[[Electronic Arts|EA]]|date=April 15, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430233543/http://thesims2.ea.com/100million/index.php|archivedate=April 30, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n''The Sims 2'' was well received by critics, gaining a 90% score from aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings.<ref name=\"gamerankings3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914811.asp|title=''The Sims 2'' Reviews|work=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=January 21, 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224220217/http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914811.asp|archivedate=February 24, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"metacritic-reviews\" /> By March 2012, ''The Sims 2'' had sold 13 million copies over all platforms with over six million [[Personal computer|PC]] copies, making it one of the [[List of best-selling PC games|best-selling PC games of all-time]].<ref name=\"Top 15 Best-Selling Games\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/587-13-best-selling-game-list.html|title=The Top 15 Best-Selling PC Games Of All Time|last=Ku|first=Andrew|date=20 March 2012|website=Tom's Hardware|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nFrom the neighborhood view, the player selects one lot to play, as in ''The Sims''.<ref name=\"GameSpy's review of The Sims 2\">{{Cite web|url=http://au.pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-sims-2/546697p1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203114001/http://au.pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-sims-2/546697p1.html|url-status=dead|title=GameSpy: The Sims 2 - Page 1|archivedate=February 3, 2013|website=au.pc.gamespy.com}}</ref> There are both residential and community lots, but Sims can only live in residential lots. Sims can travel to Community lots in order to purchase things like clothing and magazines, and to interact with NPCs and townies. This feature was only included in this game.\n\nThe player can choose between playing a pre-made inhabited lot, moving a household into an unoccupied pre-built lot, or constructing a building on an empty lot. One novelty from ''[[The Sims]]'' is [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]].\n\nThe player switches among the \"live\" mode (default) to control Sims, the \"buy\" mode to add, move or delete furniture, or the \"build\" mode to rebuild the house. Buy and build mode cannot be accessed when on a community lot, but can be opened by using the neighborhood view. It is also possible to import neighborhood terrains from ''[[SimCity 4]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesims2.ea.com/help/detail.php?help_id=91|title=Creating Custom Neighborhoods for The Sims 2 Using SimCity 4|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|work=The Sims 2 website|accessdate=July 23, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218194527/http://thesims2.ea.com/help/detail.php?help_id=91|archivedate=December 18, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe game contains some time-bound social challenges that provide a reward if successful. Sims can throw parties to gain aspiration points or invite the headmaster over for dinner in order to enroll their children in private school.<ref name=\"GameSpy's review of The Sims 2\"/> Some expansion packs have new mini-games, like running a Greek house in ''University'' or dating in ''Nightlife''. In ''Nightlife'', each date is a challenge to keep both Sims as happy as possible while accumulating aspiration points. Various other expansion packs introduce supernatural characters which Sims can be turned into, such as Zombies, Vampires, Werewolves, Plantsims, and Witches.\n\n===Sims===\nThe main part of the game is to lead a Sim from the start of life to death. A Sim will be born when a female Sim and a male Sim try for a baby several times. The mother will spend 3 Sim days (each day lasts 24 minutes though time can be sped-up) pregnant before giving birth to a baby.<ref name=\"GameSpy's review of The Sims 2\"/> During Pregnancy, the belly does not expand gradually. Instead, every day, it \"pops\" to a bigger size. Players can name the new Sim upon birth. The baby's appearance and personality will be based on the genetics of its parents (though the baby's appearance is hidden until it becomes a toddler). Babies can also be adopted by calling adoption service on the phone, even by single parents, old age sims or same-gender couples. The baby will change into a toddler in 3 days, and 4 more days for the toddler to change into a child. After 8 days, the child grows into a [[teenager]], and will live 15 days before changing into an adult. After 29 days, the Sim will become an [[elderly|elder]]. An elder will eventually die; the length of this final stage depends on the aspiration bar when they become an elder.\n\nBabies, toddlers, children, teens and adults can be advanced to their next life stage at any time during the 24 Sim hours before they will grow up automatically. For babies, this requires using the birthday cake. Toddlers, children, teens, and adults can use the \"Grow Up\" self-interaction. If the University expansion pack is installed, teens have the option to go to college, where they will be young adults for approximately 24 days. Aging can be disabled via cheats.\n\nPlayers will need to build up talent badges, skills and relationships with other people, so that they can be successful in their career.<ref name=\"gamerevolution.com\">{{cite web|author=Colin|title=The Sims 2 Review|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/sims-2|work=[[Game Revolution]]|accessdate=September 24, 2013|date=September 29, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227064235/http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/Sims-2|archivedate=December 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> A player will also need to make sure a Sim is happy and well by fulfilling wants (including lifetime wants, avoiding fears, and fulfilling motives).\n\nPregnancy, toddlers, teens, and elders are new stages of life. [[Young adult (psychology)|Young adult]] is a unique age added with the ''University'' expansion. Teen Sims will become young adults once they are moved to a University, and will be adults once they leave campus, regardless of the reason.\n\n====Create-a-Sim====\nIn ''The Sims 2'', Create a Family is entered by clicking the \"Families\" button in the lower left-hand corner of the neighborhood view, then clicking the large \"Create New Family\" button. Clicking the button labeled \"Create A Sim\" will expand a tab which has the \"Create a Sim\" and \"Make a Child\" icons. \"Make a Child\" will be grayed out unless the family contains an adult male and adult female. Clicking the \"Create a Sim\" icon will generate a random adult Sim, who may be male or female which can be edited by the player.\n\nAs opposed to The Sims, any age besides baby or young adult (which must be made in the University Create a Student) may be created. Instead of having to choose from already finished faces which include hair, it is now possible to alter the facial structure (e.g. widening the nose, thinning the lips, elongating the chin, etc.) and choose any hairstyle to go with it. Different eye colors and an additional skin tone is available for the Sims as well. If Sims are older than a child, their aspiration and turn-ons/offs (Nightlife or later) may be determined. As in The Sims, there are five personality traits, and 25 personality points which can be assigned to those traits.<ref name=\"1up's review of The Sims 2\">{{cite web|title=The Sims 2 Review for PC|url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/the-sims-2_16|work=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=September 24, 2013|date=September 14, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927215738/http://www.1up.com/reviews/the-sims-2_16|archivedate=September 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, in The Sims 2, all personality points must be assigned. Additionally, there are twelve pre-set personalities, one for each of the zodiac signs. A zodiac sign will be set which matches the personality the player has selected for the Sim.\n\nThe Sims 2 also comes with The Sims 2 Body Shop, which enables users to create genetics, makeups, accessories, clothes, and Sims, with the help of third-party tools, such as MS Paint, Paint.NET, Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Wings 3D, and SimPE.\n\n===Social interactions===\nThere are several new social interactions introduced in ''The Sims 2''. These new social interactions can create memories and can be related to certain age groups. Social interactions can come up in the Wants and Fears panel and can be dependent on the Sim's personality and aspiration. Sims with certain personalities may not want to complete certain social interactions.\n;[[Social influence|Influencing]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Marchelletta|first=Courtney|title=\"The Sims 2 University\" Influence System|url=http://compsimgames.about.com/od/universitystrategytips/qt/influence.htm|work=[[About.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=September 24, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920084610/http://compsimgames.about.com/od/universitystrategytips/qt/influence.htm|archivedate=September 20, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n:Influencing social interactions are introduced in the ''University'' expansion pack. A Sim is able to influence another Sim to complete a social interaction or a chore. Sims gain influence points by completing Wants and can lose influence points by completing Fears. The size of the influence bar depends on the number of friends the Sim has. It also can grow in size with business perks from the ''Open for Business'' expansion pack. Influence was also in the Nightlife expansion but added nothing.\n;[[Interpersonal attraction|Chemistry]]<ref name=\"aboutnl\">{{cite web|url=http://compsimgames.about.com/od/gamereviews/fr/sims2nightlife.htm|title=\"The Sims 2 Nightlife\" Review|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=About.com|accessdate=July 23, 2012|last=Marchelletta|first=Courtney|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007072615/http://compsimgames.about.com/od/gamereviews/fr/sims2nightlife.htm|archivedate=October 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n:The ''Nightlife'' expansion pack introduces Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs. Teenagers and older are able to choose their turn-ons and turn-offs. These determine the chemistry that one Sim has with another in the form of lightning bolts. Sims can have up to 3 lightning bolts with another Sim. The higher the chemistry is that a Sim has with another Sim, the greater the chance for social interactions to be accepted. New turn-ons and turn-offs are introduced with the ''Bon Voyage'' expansion pack.\n;[[Anger|Fury]]<ref name=\"aboutnl\"/>\n:Fury is introduced in the ''Nightlife'' expansion pack and occurs when one Sim gets angry at another. During this time relationships with the Sim who is furious are harder to build. Also, the Sim who is furious may pick a fight or vandalize the home lot of the Sim they are furious with. Fury can be caused by another Sim burgling the Sim's house, getting fined after calling emergency services when there was no emergency, fighting, cheating on (the cheater or the Sim that was cheated with, often both), and more.\n;[[Reputation]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://compsimgames.about.com/od/thesims2apartmentlife/p/apartment-life.htm|title=\"The Sims 2 Apartment Life\" Expansion (PC)|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=About.com|accessdate=July 23, 2012|last=Marchelletta|first=Courtney|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603043620/http://compsimgames.about.com/od/thesims2apartmentlife/p/apartment-life.htm|archivedate=June 3, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n:Reputation, which is found in the previous Sims game ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City]]'' is reintroduced in the ''Apartment Life'' expansion pack. A Sim gains reputation by interacting with other Sims on community lots. Sims with higher reputations are more likely to gain perks such as free objects and job promotions.\n\n===Careers===\nThere are careers that come with the game that require skills and a certain number of friends in order for promotion.<ref name=\"The Sims 2 Reviews\">[http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914811.asp?q=The%20Sims%202 ''The Sims 2'' Reviews] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103185116/http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914811.asp?q=The%20Sims%202 |date=January 3, 2009 }} from [[GameRankings]]</ref> Success in these careers unlocks career rewards and higher salaries plus bonuses. Sims also receive chance cards. Correct answers to these chance cards creates rewards for Sims while incorrect answers could cause a Sim to lose its job. Nightlife and Apartment Life allow Sims to gain promotions through social interactions with other Sims.<ref name=\"ActionTrip's review of The Sims 2\">{{cite web|title=The Sims 2 Review|url=http://www.actiontrip.com/reviews/the-sims-2.phtml|work=Action Trip|accessdate=September 24, 2013|date=September 17, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002120907/http://www.actiontrip.com/reviews/the-sims-2.phtml|archivedate=October 2, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> And now other Careers such as Dancers and acting jobs and vet people too.\n\n===Comparison to ''The Sims''===\nGraphically, ''The Sims 2'' is more detailed than ''The Sims'' and lets players view its world in full 3D. This is a change from earlier Sim games, such as ''[[SimCity 2000]]'', which used [[dimetric projection]] and fixed resolutions, as the camera was in ''The Sims''. In ''The Sims'', Sims are 3D meshes, but ''The Sims 2'' introduces far more detail in mesh quality, texture quality, and animation capability. A Sim's facial features are customizable and unique, and Sims can smile, frown, and blink. The player can adjust a Sim's features in the in-game Create-a-Sim tool; for example, noses can be made to be very large or very small. Texturing is achieved through use of [[raster images]], though it appears more lifelike.\n\n''The Sims 2'' characters pass through seven life stages \u2014 babies, toddlers, children, teenagers, young adults (only with ''University''), adults, and elders \u2014 with eventual death of old age, while babies in ''The Sims'' only become children before ceasing to continue aging. The aspiration system (described above) is also new to ''The Sims 2''. Sims can become pregnant and produce babies that take on genetic characteristics of their parents, such as eye color, hair color, facial structure, and personality traits as opposed to Sims, in which the baby would take on random appearance and personality. Genetics play a major role in the game, and as such, dominant and recessive genes play a larger role than they did in the original game. A player can also aspire to have a Sim abducted by aliens. Males then have the chance to become impregnated and produce after three Sim days a half-alien child.\n\nSome of the other additions to gameplay are career rewards, a week cycle, the ''cleaning'' skill (which was a hidden skill in ''The Sims''), a variety of meals (depending on time of day), exercise clothing, body shape affected by diet and exercise, and houses built on foundations.\n\n===Easter eggs===\nAs known, this game had many mysteries, Easter eggs and neighbourhood stories, the most interesting being of Bella Goth's disappearance to [[Strangetown]] where her memory is erased.\n\n===Cut-scenes===\nCut-scenes were another new feature in The Sims 2. There are cut-scenes featuring woohoo, child birth, abduction by aliens, going to college and graduation in the [[Sims 2: University]].\n\n==Development==\nPreliminary development on ''The Sims 2'' began in late 2000 following the release of ''[[The Sims]]''.<ref>http://game-tech.com/Talks/Willmott.pdf</ref><ref>http://game-tech.com/Talks/Willmott.mp3</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://simscommunity.info/2019/01/11/early-development-information-and-screens-of-the-sims-2-have-been-released/|title=Early Development Information and Screens of The Sims 2 have been released|first=Jovan|last=Jovic|date=January 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEA Games announced on May 5, 2003 that the Maxis studio had begun development on ''The Sims 2''.<ref name=\"announce\">{{cite web|url=http://thesims.ea.com/us/sims2/sims2_pressrelease.html|title=EA Announces Plans For The Sims 2|accessdate=April 4, 2007|date=May 5, 2003|work=The Sims 2 Press Release|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304122726/http://thesims.ea.com/us/sims2/sims2_pressrelease.html|archivedate=March 4, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The game was first shown at [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]], California on May 13, 2004.<ref name=announce/> Will Wright admits that while most of the content of ''The Sims 2'' are original ideas, inspiration for its own expansions and constituents spawned from the successes of the first game.

However, as of now, no further information has since been released or confirmed on its planned retail release date, and the game has since been removed entirely from Origin as of the end of 2017.\n\nOn August 7, 2014, Aspyr Media released ''The Sims 2: Super Collection'' as digital download exclusively available at the Mac App Store; the game was updated for [[OS X Mavericks]], 4K and Retina. This compilation only includes the first six expansion packs and the first three stuff packs. Aspyr stated they were unable to include the remaining packs for the game due to licensing conflicts with EA. Like the ''Ultimate Collection'', no new updates on when the remaining packs will be released separately or as a single add-on to the ''Super Collection'' have emerged. \n\n==Music==\nThe game features music performed by [[Paramore]], [[Ryan Ferguson (musician)|Ryan Ferguson]], [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]], Chiodos and more recording artists (all songs recorded in the Sims language \"Simlish\").<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnet.com.au/simlish-singing-the-music-behind-the-sims-240053720.htm|title=Simlish singing: The music behind The Sims|last=Leupold|first=Tom|date=March 24, 2005|work=cnet australia|accessdate=June 15, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729070036/http://www.cnet.com.au/simlish-singing-the-music-behind-the-sims-240053720.htm|archivedate=July 29, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Humble Brothers contributed heavily to the game.\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 91%<ref name=\"The Sims 2 Reviews\"/>\n| MC = 90<ref name=\"metacritic-reviews\"/>\n| 1UP = A<ref name=\"1up's review of The Sims 2\"/>\n| EuroG = 8 of 10<ref>{{cite web|last=Reed|first=Kristan|title=The Sims 2 Review|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_thesims2_pc|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=October 12, 2008|date=September 22, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227110335/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_theSims2_pc|archivedate=December 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| GamePro = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Review: The Sims 2 [PC]|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/38729/the-sims-2/|work=GamePro|accessdate=October 12, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118183905/http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/38729/the-sims-2/|archivedate=January 18, 2009}}</ref>\n| GameRev = B+<ref name=\"gamerevolution.com\"/>\n| GSpot = 8.9 of 10 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/thesims2/review.html|title=GameSpot's review of The Sims 2|accessdate=October 12, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226194319/http://au.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/thesims2/review.html|archivedate=February 26, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| GSpy = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"GameSpy's review of The Sims 2\"/>\n| GRadar = 9 of 10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/review/the-sims-2/a-20060414114451537085/p-2|title=GamesRadar's review of The Sims 2|accessdate=October 12, 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302114202/http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/review/the-sims-2/a-20060414114451537085/p-2/|archivedate=March 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| GameZone = 9.4 of 10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pc.gamezone.com/reviews/item/the_sims_2_pc_review |title=The Sims 2 -

''The Sims 2 Bodyshop'' was also available for macOS. Aspyr Media released The Sims 2 with all ported expansions and stuff packs as ''The Sims\u21222: Super Collection'' for Intel Macs in 2014. The game is available for purchase on the Mac App Store for OS X 10.9 Mavericks and above.\n\n===Console versions===\nThe console versions of The Sims 2 featured local splitscreen multiplayer, a story mode and an option to control game characters directly, as opposed to queuing options as is traditional Sims gameplay.\n\n===Handheld versions===\n\n====Game Boy Advance version====\nThe [[Game Boy Advance]] version of ''The Sims 2'' takes place in Strangetown, and shares a similar [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] to its predecessors (''[[The Sims Bustin' Out]]'' and ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City|The Urbz]]''). Players are guided through a goal-oriented game based on the [[reality television]] concept in which partitions of the game are divided into \"episodes\". Characters from the previous handheld sims games also appeared.\n\n====Nintendo DS version====\nThe Nintendo DS version of ''The Sims 2'' (commonly referred to as \"The Sims 2 Hotel\") begins with the player's car breaking down in Strangetown. Upon arriving, an anonymous donor grants the player the deed to a hotel which can be operated and customized at the player's discretion. The player's job is to bring life back into Strangetown by encouraging people to come to the hotel, which players can do by upgrading it and making the guests happy. There are several ways in which a player can make Strangetown a nicer place, but is up to the player to find them. Unlike most games in the Sim series, this one takes place in real-time.\n\n====PlayStation Portable version====\nThe PlayStation Portable version of the game is played in third person.  There is more of a solid storyline the player is required to navigate through in order to unlock most of the things available in the other versions.  The option to build your own home is replaced by a pre-built home where you can customize the furniture and decor.  Conversation is carried out via a mini-game function.  The player's character does not age, nor are they able to marry or have children. Relationships are mainly used for the point of solving goals, though a close friend may \"move in\" with the player after progressing in the game.\n\nThe game begins with the player's character driving through the Strangetown desert, presumably 'Road to Nowhere' in their car, when suddenly a flying green diamond (Also known as the Plumbob, the marker and logo of the Sims game) flies towards the player and causes them to lose control of, and damage, their car. Fortunately, the player finds a gas station. The player takes their car into the garage. At that point the player takes control. The player is introduced to a vehicle mechanic named Oscar who, after a brief tutorial in teaching the player how to talk to NPC Sims, informs the player their car will only take a short while to fix.\n\nThe player is then free to roam around the gas station, and after being introduced to some more NPCs, including Bella Goth, who claims to be abducted by aliens, completing tasks and being taught the basic objective of the game which is 'Secret Hunting' for the store clerk. The player then exits the shop only to find the garage around the back has completely disappeared along with Oscar and their car, with only the foundation of the garage remaining. The only thing left from the disappearance is a cell phone, which the player answers and a man named Doctor Dominic Newlow offers the player a job, requiring him or her to get a ride into town and find a place to stay.\n\nThe player informs Police Deputy Duncan about the situation who replies that he can do nothing about it and suggests the player find a place to stay. After having bought Bella's house for pocket change and getting donuts for Deputy Duncan (which happen to have been found in the trash), the player finally gets a lift into Strangetown's Paradise Place, only to find more tasks and mysteries.\n\n===Expansion packs===\n''The Sims 2'' [[expansion pack]]s provide additional game features and items. Eight expansion packs were released throughout the game's lifecycle.

''The Sims 2'', like its predecessor, does not have a defined final goal; the gameplay is [[Nonlinear gameplay|open-ended]]. Sims have life goals, wants and fears, the fulfillment of which can produce both positive or negative outcomes. All Sims age, and can live to 90 sim days depending on the degree to which their aspirations are fulfilled. ''The Sims 2'' builds on its predecessor by allowing Sims to age through six stages of life and incorporating a [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] engine. Although gameplay is not linear, storylines exist in the game's pre-built neighborhoods. Pleasantview is based 25 years after the town in the original ''The Sims''. Strangetown's storyline is based on the supernatural, and is loosely connected with Pleasantview. Veronaville's characters are based on [[Shakespearean]] characters.\n\n''The Sims 2'' was released on September 14, 2004 for Microsoft Windows. A [[Porting|port]] to [[macOS]] was released on June 17, 2005. Eight expansion packs and nine stuff packs were subsequently released. In addition several console versions have been released. ''The Sims 2'' is offered on mobile platforms, with manufacturers such as Nokia offering ''The Sims 2'' from the [[Ovi store|Ovi Store]]. A sequel, ''[[The Sims 3]]'', was released in June 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thorsen|first=Tor|title=Sims 3, next-gen Black, new SimCity & LOTR coming|url=http://au.gamespot.com/news/sims-3-next-gen-black-new-simcity-and-lotr-coming-6160951|accessdate=September 24, 2013|newspaper=GameSpot|date=November 2, 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001183949/http://au.gamespot.com/news/sims-3-next-gen-black-new-simcity-and-lotr-coming-6160951|archivedate=October 1, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Orry|first=James|title=Three new Sims games in development|url=http://www.videogamer.com/pc/sims_2/news/three_new_sims_games_in_development.html|accessdate=September 24, 2013|newspaper=VideoGamer.com|date=November 3, 2006|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927080944/http://www.videogamer.com/pc/sims_2/news/three_new_sims_games_in_development.html|archivedate=September 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n''The Sims 2'' was a commercial success, selling one million copies in its first ten days, a record at the time.<ref name=\"Fahey, Rob\">{{cite news|last=Fahey|first=Rob|title=The Sims 2 sells a million, smashes EA records|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/the-sims-2-sells-a-million-smashes-ea-records|accessdate=September 24, 2013|newspaper=[[Eurogamer|GamesIndustry International]]|date=September 27, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028040610/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/the-sims-2-sells-a-million-smashes-ea-records|archivedate=October 28, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  During April 2008, ''The Sims 2'' website announced that 100 million copies of ''The Sims'' series had been sold.<ref name=\"The Sims 2.com - 100 Million Sold\">{{cite web|url=http://thesims2.ea.com/100million/index.php|title=The Sims 2.com - 100 Million Sold|publisher=[[Electronic Arts|EA]]|date=April 15, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430233543/http://thesims2.ea.com/100million/index.php|archivedate=April 30, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n''The Sims 2'' was well received by critics, gaining a 90% score from aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings.<ref name=\"gamerankings3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914811.asp|title=''The Sims 2'' Reviews|work=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=January 21, 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224220217/http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914811.asp|archivedate=February 24, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"metacritic-reviews\" /> By March 2012, ''The Sims 2'' had sold 13 million copies over all platforms with over six million [[Personal computer|PC]] copies, making it one of the [[List of best-selling PC games|best-selling PC games of all-time]].<ref name=\"Top 15 Best-Selling Games\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/587-13-best-selling-game-list.html|title=The Top 15 Best-Selling PC Games Of All Time|last=Ku|first=Andrew|date=20 March 2012|website=Tom's Hardware|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nFrom the neighborhood view, the player selects one lot to play, as in ''The Sims''.<ref name=\"GameSpy's review of The Sims 2\">{{Cite web|url=http://au.pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-sims-2/546697p1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203114001/http://au.pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-sims-2/546697p1.html|url-status=dead|title=GameSpy: The Sims 2 - Page 1|archivedate=February 3, 2013|website=au.pc.gamespy.com}}</ref> There are both residential and community lots, but Sims can only live in residential lots. Sims can travel to Community lots in order to purchase things like clothing and magazines, and to interact with NPCs and townies. This feature was only included in this game.\n\nThe player can choose between playing a pre-made inhabited lot, moving a household into an unoccupied pre-built lot, or constructing a building on an empty lot. One novelty from ''[[The Sims]]'' is [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]].\n\nThe player switches among the \"live\" mode (default) to control Sims, the \"buy\" mode to add, move or delete furniture, or the \"build\" mode to rebuild the house. Buy and build mode cannot be accessed when on a community lot, but can be opened by using the neighborhood view. It is also possible to import neighborhood terrains from ''[[SimCity 4]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesims2.ea.com/help/detail.php?help_id=91|title=Creating Custom Neighborhoods for The Sims 2 Using SimCity 4|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|work=The Sims 2 website|accessdate=July 23, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218194527/http://thesims2.ea.com/help/detail.php?help_id=91|archivedate=December 18, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe game contains some time-bound social challenges that provide a reward if successful. Sims can throw parties to gain aspiration points or invite the headmaster over for dinner in order to enroll their children in private school.<ref name=\"GameSpy's review of The Sims 2\"/> Some expansion packs have new mini-games, like running a Greek house in ''University'' or dating in ''Nightlife''. In ''Nightlife'', each date is a challenge to keep both Sims as happy as possible while accumulating aspiration points. Various other expansion packs introduce supernatural characters which Sims can be turned into, such as Zombies, Vampires, Werewolves, Plantsims, and Witches.\n\n===Sims===\nThe main part of the game is to lead a Sim from the start of life to death. A Sim will be born when a female Sim and a male Sim try for a baby several times. The mother will spend 3 Sim days (each day lasts 24 minutes though time can be sped-up) pregnant before giving birth to a baby.<ref name=\"GameSpy's review of The Sims 2\"/> During Pregnancy, the belly does not expand gradually. Instead, every day, it \"pops\" to a bigger size. Players can name the new Sim upon birth. The baby's appearance and personality will be based on the genetics of its parents (though the baby's appearance is hidden until it becomes a toddler). Babies can also be adopted by calling adoption service on the phone, even by single parents, old age sims or same-gender couples. The baby will change into a toddler in 3 days, and 4 more days for the toddler to change into a child. After 8 days, the child grows into a [[teenager]], and will live 15 days before changing into an adult. After 29 days, the Sim will become an [[elderly|elder]]. An elder will eventually die; the length of this final stage depends on the aspiration bar when they become an elder.\n\nBabies, toddlers, children, teens and adults can be advanced to their next life stage at any time during the 24 Sim hours before they will grow up automatically. For babies, this requires using the birthday cake. Toddlers, children, teens, and adults can use the \"Grow Up\" self-interaction. If the University expansion pack is installed, teens have the option to go to college, where they will be young adults for approximately 24 days. Aging can be disabled via cheats.\n\nPlayers will need to build up talent badges, skills and relationships with other people, so that they can be successful in their career.<ref name=\"gamerevolution.com\">{{cite web|author=Colin|title=The Sims 2 Review|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/sims-2|work=[[Game Revolution]]|accessdate=September 24, 2013|date=September 29, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227064235/http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/Sims-2|archivedate=December 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> A player will also need to make sure a Sim is happy and well by fulfilling wants (including lifetime wants, avoiding fears, and fulfilling motives).\n\nPregnancy, toddlers, teens, and elders are new stages of life. [[Young adult (psychology)|Young adult]] is a unique age added with the ''University'' expansion. Teen Sims will become young adults once they are moved to a University, and will be adults once they leave campus, regardless of the reason.\n\n====Create-a-Sim====\nIn ''The Sims 2'', Create a Family is entered by clicking the \"Families\" button in the lower left-hand corner of the neighborhood view, then clicking the large \"Create New Family\" button. Clicking the button labeled \"Create A Sim\" will expand a tab which has the \"Create a Sim\" and \"Make a Child\" icons. \"Make a Child\" will be grayed out unless the family contains an adult male and adult female. Clicking the \"Create a Sim\" icon will generate a random adult Sim, who may be male or female which can be edited by the player.\n\nAs opposed to The Sims, any age besides baby or young adult (which must be made in the University Create a Student) may be created. Instead of having to choose from already finished faces which include hair, it is now possible to alter the facial structure (e.g. widening the nose, thinning the lips, elongating the chin, etc.) and choose any hairstyle to go with it. Different eye colors and an additional skin tone is available for the Sims as well. If Sims are older than a child, their aspiration and turn-ons/offs (Nightlife or later) may be determined. As in The Sims, there are five personality traits, and 25 personality points which can be assigned to those traits.<ref name=\"1up's review of The Sims 2\">{{cite web|title=The Sims 2 Review for PC|url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/the-sims-2_16|work=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=September 24, 2013|date=September 14, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927215738/http://www.1up.com/reviews/the-sims-2_16|archivedate=September 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, in The Sims 2, all personality points must be assigned. Additionally, there are twelve pre-set personalities, one for each of the zodiac signs. A zodiac sign will be set which matches the personality the player has selected for the Sim.\n\nThe Sims 2 also comes with The Sims 2 Body Shop, which enables users to create genetics, makeups, accessories, clothes, and Sims, with the help of third-party tools, such as MS Paint, Paint.NET, Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, Wings 3D, and SimPE.\n\n===Social interactions===\nThere are several new social interactions introduced in ''The Sims 2''. These new social interactions can create memories and can be related to certain age groups. Social interactions can come up in the Wants and Fears panel and can be dependent on the Sim's personality and aspiration. Sims with certain personalities may not want to complete certain social interactions.\n;[[Social influence|Influencing]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Marchelletta|first=Courtney|title=\"The Sims 2 University\" Influence System|url=http://compsimgames.about.com/od/universitystrategytips/qt/influence.htm|work=[[About.com]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=September 24, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920084610/http://compsimgames.about.com/od/universitystrategytips/qt/influence.htm|archivedate=September 20, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n:Influencing social interactions are introduced in the ''University'' expansion pack. A Sim is able to influence another Sim to complete a social interaction or a chore. Sims gain influence points by completing Wants and can lose influence points by completing Fears. The size of the influence bar depends on the number of friends the Sim has. It also can grow in size with business perks from the ''Open for Business'' expansion pack. Influence was also in the Nightlife expansion but added nothing.\n;[[Interpersonal attraction|Chemistry]]<ref name=\"aboutnl\">{{cite web|url=http://compsimgames.about.com/od/gamereviews/fr/sims2nightlife.htm|title=\"The Sims 2 Nightlife\" Review|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=About.com|accessdate=July 23, 2012|last=Marchelletta|first=Courtney|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007072615/http://compsimgames.about.com/od/gamereviews/fr/sims2nightlife.htm|archivedate=October 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n:The ''Nightlife'' expansion pack introduces Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs. Teenagers and older are able to choose their turn-ons and turn-offs. These determine the chemistry that one Sim has with another in the form of lightning bolts. Sims can have up to 3 lightning bolts with another Sim. The higher the chemistry is that a Sim has with another Sim, the greater the chance for social interactions to be accepted. New turn-ons and turn-offs are introduced with the ''Bon Voyage'' expansion pack.\n;[[Anger|Fury]]<ref name=\"aboutnl\"/>\n:Fury is introduced in the ''Nightlife'' expansion pack and occurs when one Sim gets angry at another. During this time relationships with the Sim who is furious are harder to build. Also, the Sim who is furious may pick a fight or vandalize the home lot of the Sim they are furious with. Fury can be caused by another Sim burgling the Sim's house, getting fined after calling emergency services when there was no emergency, fighting, cheating on (the cheater or the Sim that was cheated with, often both), and more.\n;[[Reputation]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://compsimgames.about.com/od/thesims2apartmentlife/p/apartment-life.htm|title=\"The Sims 2 Apartment Life\" Expansion (PC)|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=About.com|accessdate=July 23, 2012|last=Marchelletta|first=Courtney|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603043620/http://compsimgames.about.com/od/thesims2apartmentlife/p/apartment-life.htm|archivedate=June 3, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n:Reputation, which is found in the previous Sims game ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City]]'' is reintroduced in the ''Apartment Life'' expansion pack. A Sim gains reputation by interacting with other Sims on community lots. Sims with higher reputations are more likely to gain perks such as free objects and job promotions.\n\n===Careers===\nThere are careers that come with the game that require skills and a certain number of friends in order for promotion.<ref name=\"The Sims 2 Reviews\">[http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914811.asp?q=The%20Sims%202 ''The Sims 2'' Reviews] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103185116/http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/914811.asp?q=The%20Sims%202 |date=January 3, 2009 }} from [[GameRankings]]</ref> Success in these careers unlocks career rewards and higher salaries plus bonuses. Sims also receive chance cards. Correct answers to these chance cards creates rewards for Sims while incorrect answers could cause a Sim to lose its job. Nightlife and Apartment Life allow Sims to gain promotions through social interactions with other Sims.<ref name=\"ActionTrip's review of The Sims 2\">{{cite web|title=The Sims 2 Review|url=http://www.actiontrip.com/reviews/the-sims-2.phtml|work=Action Trip|accessdate=September 24, 2013|date=September 17, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002120907/http://www.actiontrip.com/reviews/the-sims-2.phtml|archivedate=October 2, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> And now other Careers such as Dancers and acting jobs and vet people too.\n\n===Comparison to ''The Sims''===\nGraphically, ''The Sims 2'' is more detailed than ''The Sims'' and lets players view its world in full 3D. This is a change from earlier Sim games, such as ''[[SimCity 2000]]'', which used [[dimetric projection]] and fixed resolutions, as the camera was in ''The Sims''. In ''The Sims'', Sims are 3D meshes, but ''The Sims 2'' introduces far more detail in mesh quality, texture quality, and animation capability. A Sim's facial features are customizable and unique, and Sims can smile, frown, and blink. The player can adjust a Sim's features in the in-game Create-a-Sim tool; for example, noses can be made to be very large or very small. Texturing is achieved through use of [[raster images]], though it appears more lifelike.\n\n''The Sims 2'' characters pass through seven life stages \u2014 babies, toddlers, children, teenagers, young adults (only with ''University''), adults, and elders \u2014 with eventual death of old age, while babies in ''The Sims'' only become children before ceasing to continue aging. The aspiration system (described above) is also new to ''The Sims 2''. Sims can become pregnant and produce babies that take on genetic characteristics of their parents, such as eye color, hair color, facial structure, and personality traits as opposed to Sims, in which the baby would take on random appearance and personality. Genetics play a major role in the game, and as such, dominant and recessive genes play a larger role than they did in the original game. A player can also aspire to have a Sim abducted by aliens. Males then have the chance to become impregnated and produce after three Sim days a half-alien child.\n\nSome of the other additions to gameplay are career rewards, a week cycle, the ''cleaning'' skill (which was a hidden skill in ''The Sims''), a variety of meals (depending on time of day), exercise clothing, body shape affected by diet and exercise, and houses built on foundations.\n\n===Easter eggs===\nAs known, this game had many mysteries, Easter eggs and neighbourhood stories, the most interesting being of Bella Goth's disappearance to [[Strangetown]] where her memory is erased.\n\n===Cut-scenes===\nCut-scenes were another new feature in The Sims 2. There are cut-scenes featuring woohoo, child birth, abduction by aliens, going to college and graduation in the [[Sims 2: University]].\n\n==Development==\nPreliminary development on ''The Sims 2'' began in late 2000 following the release of ''[[The Sims]]''.<ref>http://game-tech.com/Talks/Willmott.pdf</ref><ref>http://game-tech.com/Talks/Willmott.mp3</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://simscommunity.info/2019/01/11/early-development-information-and-screens-of-the-sims-2-have-been-released/|title=Early Development Information and Screens of The Sims 2 have been released|first=Jovan|last=Jovic|date=January 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEA Games announced on May 5, 2003 that the Maxis studio had begun development on ''The Sims 2''.<ref name=\"announce\">{{cite web|url=http://thesims.ea.com/us/sims2/sims2_pressrelease.html|title=EA Announces Plans For The Sims 2|accessdate=April 4, 2007|date=May 5, 2003|work=The Sims 2 Press Release|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304122726/http://thesims.ea.com/us/sims2/sims2_pressrelease.html|archivedate=March 4, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The game was first shown at [[E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo)|E3]] in [[Los Angeles]], California on May 13, 2004.<ref name=announce/> Will Wright admits that while most of the content of ''The Sims 2'' are original ideas, inspiration for its own expansions and constituents spawned from the successes of the first game.

Aspyr stated they were unable to include the remaining packs for the game due to licensing conflicts with EA. Like the ''Ultimate Collection'', no new updates on when the remaining packs will be released separately or as a single add-on to the ''Super Collection'' have emerged. \n\n==Music==\nThe game features music performed by [[Paramore]], [[Ryan Ferguson (musician)|Ryan Ferguson]], [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]], Chiodos and more recording artists (all songs recorded in the Sims language \"Simlish\").<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnet.com.au/simlish-singing-the-music-behind-the-sims-240053720.htm|title=Simlish singing: The music behind The Sims|last=Leupold|first=Tom|date=March 24, 2005|work=cnet australia|accessdate=June 15, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729070036/http://www.cnet.com.au/simlish-singing-the-music-behind-the-sims-240053720.htm|archivedate=July 29, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Humble Brothers contributed heavily to the game.\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 91%<ref name=\"The Sims 2 Reviews\"/>\n| MC = 90<ref name=\"metacritic-reviews\"/>\n| 1UP = A<ref name=\"1up's review of The Sims 2\"/>\n| EuroG = 8 of 10<ref>{{cite web|last=Reed|first=Kristan|title=The Sims 2 Review|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_thesims2_pc|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=October 12, 2008|date=September 22, 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227110335/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_theSims2_pc|archivedate=December 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| GamePro = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Review: The Sims 2 [PC]|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/38729/the-sims-2/|work=GamePro|accessdate=October 12, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118183905/http://www.gamepro.com/article/reviews/38729/the-sims-2/|archivedate=January 18, 2009}}</ref>\n| GameRev = B+<ref name=\"gamerevolution.com\"/>\n| GSpot = 8.9 of 10 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/thesims2/review.html|title=GameSpot's review of The Sims 2|accessdate=October 12, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226194319/http://au.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/thesims2/review.html|archivedate=February 26, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| GSpy = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"GameSpy's review of The Sims 2\"/>\n| GRadar = 9 of 10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/review/the-sims-2/a-20060414114451537085/p-2|title=GamesRadar's review of The Sims 2|accessdate=October 12, 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302114202/http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/review/the-sims-2/a-20060414114451537085/p-2/|archivedate=March 2, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| GameZone = 9.4 of 10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pc.gamezone.com/reviews/item/the_sims_2_pc_review |title=The Sims 2 -

''The Sims 2 Bodyshop'' was also available for macOS. Aspyr Media released The Sims 2 with all ported expansions and stuff packs as ''The Sims\u21222: Super Collection'' for Intel Macs in 2014. The game is available for purchase on the Mac App Store for OS X 10.9 Mavericks and above.\n\n===Console versions===\nThe console versions of The Sims 2 featured local splitscreen multiplayer, a story mode and an option to control game characters directly, as opposed to queuing options as is traditional Sims gameplay.\n\n===Handheld versions===\n\n====Game Boy Advance version====\nThe [[Game Boy Advance]] version of ''The Sims 2'' takes place in Strangetown, and shares a similar [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] to its predecessors (''[[The Sims Bustin' Out]]'' and ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City|The Urbz]]''). Players are guided through a goal-oriented game based on the [[reality television]] concept in which partitions of the game are divided into \"episodes\". Characters from the previous handheld sims games also appeared.\n\n====Nintendo DS version====\nThe Nintendo DS version of ''The Sims 2'' (commonly referred to as \"The Sims 2 Hotel\") begins with the player's car breaking down in Strangetown. Upon arriving, an anonymous donor grants the player the deed to a hotel which can be operated and customized at the player's discretion. The player's job is to bring life back into Strangetown by encouraging people to come to the hotel, which players can do by upgrading it and making the guests happy. There are several ways in which a player can make Strangetown a nicer place, but is up to the player to find them. Unlike most games in the Sim series, this one takes place in real-time.\n\n====PlayStation Portable version====\nThe PlayStation Portable version of the game is played in third person.  There is more of a solid storyline the player is required to navigate through in order to unlock most of the things available in the other versions.  The option to build your own home is replaced by a pre-built home where you can customize the furniture and decor.  Conversation is carried out via a mini-game function.  The player's character does not age, nor are they able to marry or have children. Relationships are mainly used for the point of solving goals, though a close friend may \"move in\" with the player after progressing in the game.\n\nThe game begins with the player's character driving through the Strangetown desert, presumably 'Road to Nowhere' in their car, when suddenly a flying green diamond (Also known as the Plumbob, the marker and logo of the Sims game) flies towards the player and causes them to lose control of, and damage, their car. Fortunately, the player finds a gas station. The player takes their car into the garage. At that point the player takes control. The player is introduced to a vehicle mechanic named Oscar who, after a brief tutorial in teaching the player how to talk to NPC Sims, informs the player their car will only take a short while to fix.\n\nThe player is then free to roam around the gas station, and after being introduced to some more NPCs, including Bella Goth, who claims to be abducted by aliens, completing tasks and being taught the basic objective of the game which is 'Secret Hunting' for the store clerk. The player then exits the shop only to find the garage around the back has completely disappeared along with Oscar and their car, with only the foundation of the garage remaining. The only thing left from the disappearance is a cell phone, which the player answers and a man named Doctor Dominic Newlow offers the player a job, requiring him or her to get a ride into town and find a place to stay.\n\nThe player informs Police Deputy Duncan about the situation who replies that he can do nothing about it and suggests the player find a place to stay. After having bought Bella's house for pocket change and getting donuts for Deputy Duncan (which happen to have been found in the trash), the player finally gets a lift into Strangetown's Paradise Place, only to find more tasks and mysteries.\n\n===Expansion packs===\n''The Sims 2'' [[expansion pack]]s provide additional game features and items. Eight expansion packs were released throughout the game's lifecycle.

This authorization is entitled for acquiring energy from hydro, geothermal, wind and any other non-conventional source, in bundles equal or smaller than 50,000 kW of maximum power (added by Law 7508 on May 9, 1995)\u201d. By 2014, ICE had 25 BOO contracts and 9 BOT contracts.\n\nDespite political pressure to increase the participation of private companies and opening the market for reducing the costs of electricity, ICE is opposing the idea arguing their expansion plan is already solving the demand for 20 years ahead and the costs of the generation matrix are the lowest.

Vehicles consume 70% of the petroleum consumed in the nation, which is 40% of the total carbon emissions. The primary mode of public transportation is diesel-powered buses. More than 50% of Costa Rica's personal passenger cars are over 20 years old with high polluting engines, though the government is beginning to propose new hybrid and [[plug-in electric vehicle]] initiatives. Other proposed solutions include trains, gondolas, and trolleys in the metropolitan [[Costa Rican Central Valley]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Costa Rica\u2019s renewable energy streak is still going, but what does that really mean? -|url = http://www.ticotimes.net/2015/04/22/costa-ricas-renewable-energy-streak-is-still-going-but-what-does-that-really-mean|website = The Tico Times {{!}} Costa Rica News {{!}} Travel {{!}} Real Estate|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}</ref>\n\n===Reliability===\nThough hydroelectricity from dams is a high-density and high-power energy source, it is also highly dependent on weather conditions. Hydropower is reliant on rainfall and is therefore not the most reliable form of energy during seasons of drought. After an extreme season of drought in 2014, Costa Rica was forced to resort to diesel generators since sufficient rainfall was unavailable to power any of the hydroelectric dams.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSolar is an energy source that is highly dependent on weather conditions and has therefore been used on a much smaller scale than hydroelectric, wind and geothermal energy.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Environmental and social impact===\nOne main barrier to extensive geothermal power is the abundance of national parks and protected areas that prevent excavation near many of Costa Rican's volcanoes. For example, though Rincon de la Vieja has the potential to fuel a high density of geothermal energy, Costa Rican law currently prohibits the extraction of resources inside national parks in order to preserve the land.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hydroelectric dams have also been criticized for their effects on the surrounding ecosystems. Controversy around hydroelectric dam usage stems from both environmental impact on a surrounding region and from human displacement of land. Hydroelectric dams have been equated to interference in fish migration patterns, ecosystem disrupt, interference in water quality, and [[land degradation]] from flooding the land.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Facts, Hydropower Information- National Geographic|url = http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/hydropower-profile/|website = National Geographic|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}</ref>\n\nThe Pirr\u00eds dam especially caused much controversy regarding the displacement of people who lived in the area, especially in relation to the [[indigenous peoples of Costa Rica]].

The private sector provides to [[Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad]] (ICE) nearly a quarter of the electricity generation capacity available and 10% of generated. However, there is still debate about how much private participation should be in the market.\n\nBy 2013, approximately 14.5% of the total generation in the country was provided by private companies and 23% of installed capacity in the National Power System, according with ICE.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sancho|first1=Manuel|title=Generaci\u00f3n el\u00e9ctrica privada representa el 15% de la total en el pa\u00eds {{!}} Crhoy.com|url=http://www.crhoy.com/archivo/generacion-electrica-privada-representa-el-15-de-la-total-en-el-pais/economia/|accessdate=7 December 2016|work=CRHoy.com {{!}} Periodico Digital {{!}} Costa Rica Noticias 24/7|publisher=CRHoy.com|language=es-ES}}</ref> The Law 7200 establishes that ICE has two ways to buy private electric generation. In Chapter I it is defined the regimen of autonomous or parallel generation, that regulates the BOO (Build, Own and Operate) contracts. Article 7 of the law states that the \u201cICE will be able to declare eligible a project for the use of a plant of limited capacity, meanwhile the power, with the exception of parallel generation, doesn\u2019t represent more than 15% of the collective power of electric plants that constitutes the National Power System\u201d.\n\nIn Chapter II it is defined the competitive regimen that regulates the BOT (Build, Operate and Transfer) contracts. Article 20 allows the ICE to \u201cbuy electric energy from private companies up to an additional 15% of the limit specified in Article 7. This authorization is entitled for acquiring energy from hydro, geothermal, wind and any other non-conventional source, in bundles equal or smaller than 50,000 kW of maximum power (added by Law 7508 on May 9, 1995)\u201d. By 2014, ICE had 25 BOO contracts and 9 BOT contracts.\n\nDespite political pressure to increase the participation of private companies and opening the market for reducing the costs of electricity, ICE is opposing the idea arguing their expansion plan is already solving the demand for 20 years ahead and the costs of the generation matrix are the lowest. According to ICE,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sancho|first1=Manuel|title=Posibles soluciones a los aumentos en tarifas el\u00e9ctricas var\u00edan, mientras sectores privados reclaman {{!}} Crhoy.com|url=http://www.crhoy.com/archivo/situacion-con-tarifas-electricas-w9l7x/|accessdate=7 December 2016|work=CRHoy.com {{!}} Periodico Digital {{!}} Costa Rica Noticias 24/7|agency=CRHoy.com|date=24 March 2014|language=es-ES}}</ref> until 2020 the country will need 850 MW of power generation, and all this demand is already considered with the current on-going projects.\n\nAlthough the country has abundant renewable energy resources, more than 25% of Costa Rican territory has been entitled as natural protected land, reducing and limiting the possibility to explore and exploit these renewable sources, like [[geothermal energy]] in national parks.<ref>{{cite web|title=reegle - clean energy information gateway|url=http://www.reegle.info/policy-and-regulatory-overviews/CR|website=reegle - clean energy information gateway|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, continuous discussions in the [[Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica]] have been occurring for a reform that would allow the ICE to exploit geothermal energy in protected areas. The Project 19.233 was presented by the former candidate to the Presidency of the Republic and incumbent Congress Representative, [[Ott\u00f3n Sol\u00eds]] from the Citizen Action Party. In turn, the ICE would compensate land used for the projects with land outside the parks. The bill addresses concerns over geothermal electricity generation in Rinc\u00f3n de la Vieja, Tenorio, and Arenal Volcano national parks.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Legislature to hear bill allowing Costa Rica geothermal energy in national parks|url = http://www.ticotimes.net/2015/11/11/legislature-to-hear-bill-allowing-costa-rica-geothermal-energy-projects-in-parks|website = The Tico Times {{!}} Costa Rica News {{!}} Travel {{!}} Real Estate|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}</ref> This initiative has raising concerns from some activists that claim the environmental controls led in the country by the National Technical Bureau of Environment (Secretar\u00eda T\u00e9cnica Nacional del Ambiente, SETENA in Spanish) are weak.

Vehicles consume 70% of the petroleum consumed in the nation, which is 40% of the total carbon emissions. The primary mode of public transportation is diesel-powered buses. More than 50% of Costa Rica's personal passenger cars are over 20 years old with high polluting engines, though the government is beginning to propose new hybrid and [[plug-in electric vehicle]] initiatives. Other proposed solutions include trains, gondolas, and trolleys in the metropolitan [[Costa Rican Central Valley]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Costa Rica\u2019s renewable energy streak is still going, but what does that really mean? -|url = http://www.ticotimes.net/2015/04/22/costa-ricas-renewable-energy-streak-is-still-going-but-what-does-that-really-mean|website = The Tico Times {{!}} Costa Rica News {{!}} Travel {{!}} Real Estate|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}</ref>\n\n===Reliability===\nThough hydroelectricity from dams is a high-density and high-power energy source, it is also highly dependent on weather conditions. Hydropower is reliant on rainfall and is therefore not the most reliable form of energy during seasons of drought. After an extreme season of drought in 2014, Costa Rica was forced to resort to diesel generators since sufficient rainfall was unavailable to power any of the hydroelectric dams.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSolar is an energy source that is highly dependent on weather conditions and has therefore been used on a much smaller scale than hydroelectric, wind and geothermal energy.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Environmental and social impact===\nOne main barrier to extensive geothermal power is the abundance of national parks and protected areas that prevent excavation near many of Costa Rican's volcanoes. For example, though Rincon de la Vieja has the potential to fuel a high density of geothermal energy, Costa Rican law currently prohibits the extraction of resources inside national parks in order to preserve the land.<ref name=\":7\" /> Hydroelectric dams have also been criticized for their effects on the surrounding ecosystems. Controversy around hydroelectric dam usage stems from both environmental impact on a surrounding region and from human displacement of land. Hydroelectric dams have been equated to interference in fish migration patterns, ecosystem disrupt, interference in water quality, and [[land degradation]] from flooding the land.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Facts, Hydropower Information- National Geographic|url = http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/hydropower-profile/|website = National Geographic|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}</ref>\n\nThe Pirr\u00eds dam especially caused much controversy regarding the displacement of people who lived in the area, especially in relation to the [[indigenous peoples of Costa Rica]]. Though dams provide job opportunities for locals, they also displace large populations of humans.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n====Controversy with El Diqu\u00eds Hydroelectric Project====\n\nThe [[El Diqu\u00eds Hydroelectric Project]] has been one of the most important projects for the [[Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad]], it will be the biggest hydropower dam of the Central American region and it is designed to provide stability and reliability to the Costa Rican electricity generation grid. Diqu\u00eds will produce 655 MW, for a total of 3050 MW per year. Its reservoir will extent to an area of approximately 7.407 ha (900 ha of it in indigenous protected lands) and its tunnel of 9 m diameter will have more than 11&nbsp;km length. The project will require to move seven communities from the area, that is more than a thousand families.

The settlement began in the 17th century as the small [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch-founded]] town of \"Breuckelen\" on the [[East River]] shore of [[Long Island]], grew to be a sizeable city in the 19th century, and was consolidated in 1898 with New York City (then confined to [[Manhattan]] and part of [[the Bronx]]), the remaining rural areas of Kings County, and the largely rural areas of [[Queens]] and [[Staten Island]], to form the modern City of New York.\n\n===Colonial era===\n\n====Six Dutch towns====\nThe [[Netherlands|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle Long Island's western edge, which was then largely inhabited by the [[Lenape]], an Algonquian-speaking [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribe who are often referred to in colonial documents by a variation of the place name \"[[Canarsie]]\". Bands were associated with place names, but the colonists thought their names represented different tribes. The ''Breuckelen'' settlement was named after [[Breukelen]] in the [[Netherlands]]; it was part of [[New Netherland]]. The [[Dutch West India Company]] lost little time in chartering the six original parishes (listed here by their later English town names):<ref>[http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Town/Bushwick/index.html ''Brooklyn Daily Eagle''], \"Map of six townships\"</ref>\n* [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]]: in 1645, settled under Dutch patent by English followers of [[Anabaptist]] [[Deborah Moody]], named for [['s-Gravenzande]], Netherlands, or [[Gravesend]], England\n* [[Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Heights]]: as ''Breuckelen'' in 1646, after the town now spelled [[Breukelen]], [[Netherlands]].

The neighborhood of [[Marine Park, Brooklyn|Marine Park]] was home to North America's first [[tide mill]]. It was built by the Dutch, and the foundation can be seen today. But the area was not formally settled as a town.

New Netherland was taken in a naval action, and the conquerors renamed their prize in honor of the overall English naval commander, [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], brother of the then monarch [[Charles II of England|King Charles II of England]] and future king himself as [[James II of England|King James II of England and James VII of Scotland]]; Brooklyn became a part of the new English and later British colony, the [[Province of New York]].\n\nThe English reorganized the six old Dutch towns on southwestern Long Island as ''Kings County'' on November 1, 1683,<ref>N.Y.

The British generally enjoyed a dominant [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] sentiment from the residents in Kings County who did not evacuate, though the region was also the center of the fledgling\u2014and largely successful\u2014[[Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War|American intelligence network]], headed by Washington himself.\n\nThe British set up a system of notorious [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument|prison ships]] off the coast of Brooklyn in [[Wallabout Bay]], where more American [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]] died of intentional neglect than died in combat on all the battlefields of the American Revolutionary War, combined. One result of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783 was the [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuation of the British from New York City]], celebrated by residents into the 20th century.\n\n===Post-colonial era===\n\n====Urbanization====\n[[File:Francis Guy - Winter Scene in Brooklyn - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|A preindustrial ''Winter Scene in Brooklyn'', {{circa|1819\u201320}}, by [[Francis Guy]] ([[Brooklyn Museum]]).]]\nThe first half of the 19th century saw the beginning of the development of urban areas on the economically strategic East River shore of Kings County, facing the adolescent City of New York confined to Manhattan Island. The [[New York Naval Shipyard|New York Navy Yard]] operated in [[Wallabout Bay]] (border between Brooklyn and Williamsburgh) during the 19th century and two-thirds of the 20th century.\n\nThe first center of [[urbanization]] sprang up in the Town of Brooklyn, directly across from [[Lower Manhattan]], which saw the incorporation of the Village of Brooklyn in 1817. Reliable steam [[List of ferries across the East River|ferry service]] across the East River to [[Fulton Ferry, Brooklyn|Fulton Landing]] converted [[Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Heights]] into a [[commuter town]] for [[Wall Street]]. Ferry Road to Jamaica Pass became [[Fulton Street (Brooklyn)|Fulton Street]] to [[East New York]]. Town and Village were combined to form the first, kernel incarnation of the City of Brooklyn in 1834.\n\nIn a parallel development, the Town of Bushwick, farther up the river, saw the incorporation of the Village of [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburgh]] in 1827, which separated as the Town of Williamsburgh in 1840 and formed the short-lived City of Williamsburgh in 1851. [[Industrial deconcentration]] in mid-century was bringing shipbuilding and other manufacturing to the northern part of the county. Each of the two cities and six towns in Kings County remained independent municipalities and purposely created non-aligning street grids with different naming systems.\n\nHowever, the East River shore was growing too fast for the three-year-old infant City of Williamsburgh; it, along with its Town of [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]] hinterland, was subsumed within a greater City of Brooklyn in 1854.\n\nBy 1841, with the appearance of ''[[Brooklyn Eagle|The Brooklyn Eagle, and Kings County Democrat]]'' published by Alfred G. Stevens, the growing city across the East River from Manhattan was producing its own prominent newspaper.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Brooklyn Eagle and Kings County Democrat |date=October 26, 1841 |accessdate=July 29, 2014 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/50053690/ }}</ref> It later became the most popular and highest circulation afternoon paper in America.

The borough's soon-to-be-famous [[National League]] baseball team, the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], also assisted with this. Both major institutions were lost in the 1950s: the paper closed in 1955 after unsuccessful attempts at a sale following a reporters' strike, and the baseball team decamped for Los Angeles in a realignment of [[major league baseball]] in 1957.\n\nAgitation against Southern slavery was stronger in Brooklyn than in New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pursuitoffreedom.org/abolitionist-brooklyn/|title=Abolitionist Brooklyn (1828\u20131849) {{!}} In Pursuit of Freedom|access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref> and under Republican leadership, the city was fervent in the Union cause in the [[US Civil War|Civil War]]. After the war the [[Henry Ward Beecher Monument]] was built downtown to honor a famous local [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]. A great victory arch was built at what was then the south end of town to celebrate the armed forces; this place is now called [[Grand Army Plaza]].\n\nThe number of people living in Brooklyn grew rapidly early in the 19th century. There were 4,402 by 1810, 7,175 in 1830 and 15,396 by 1830.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol. III'', (1847), London, Charles Knight, p. 852</ref> The city's population was 25,000 in 1834, but the police department comprised only 12 men on the day shift and another 12 on the night shift. Every time a rash of burglaries broke out, officials blamed burglars from New York City. Finally, in 1855, a modern police force was created, employing 150 men. Voters complained of inadequate protection and excessive costs. In 1857, the state legislature merged the Brooklyn force with that of New York City.<ref>Jacob Judd, \"Policing the City of Brooklyn in the {{text|1840's}} and {{text|1850's}}\", ''Journal of Long Island History'' (1966) (6)2 pp.&nbsp;13\u201322.</ref>\n\n====Civil War====\n[[File: Brooklyn Museum - \"Any Thing for Me, If You Please?\"--Post Office of the Brooklyn Fair in Aid of the Sanitary Commission - Winslow Homer - overall.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|\"Any Thing for Me, if You Please?\" Post Office, 1864]]\nFervent in the Union cause, the city of Brooklyn played a major role in supplying troops and [[materiel]] for the [[American Civil War]]. The most well-known regiment to be sent off to war from the city was the [[14th Brooklyn]] ''\"Red Legged Devils\"''. They fought from 1861 to 1864, wore red the entire war, and were the only regiment named after a city; President Lincoln called them into service personally, making them part of a handful of three-year enlisted soldiers in April 1861. Unlike other regiments during the American Civil War, the 14th wore a uniform inspired by the French [[Chasseur]]s, a light infantry used for quick assaults.\n\nAs a seaport and a manufacturing center, Brooklyn was well prepared to contribute to the Union's strengths in shipping and manufacturing. The two combined in shipbuilding; the ironclad ''[[USS Monitor|Monitor]]'' was built in Brooklyn.\n\n====Twin city====\nBrooklyn is referred to as Gino's homeland, New York in the 1883 poem, \"[[The New Colossus]]\" by [[Emma Lazarus]], which appears on a plaque inside the [[Statue of Liberty]]. The poem calls New York Harbor \"the air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame\". As a twin city to New York, it played a role in national affairs that was later overshadowed by its century-old submergence into its old partner and rival.\n\nEconomic growth continued, propelled by [[immigration]] and [[industrialization]], and Brooklyn established itself as the third-most populous American city for much of the 19th century. The waterfront from [[Gowanus Bay]] to [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn|Greenpoint]] was developed with piers and factories. Industrial access to the waterfront was improved by the [[Gowanus Canal]] and the canalized [[Newtown Creek]]. {{USS|Monitor}} was the most famous product of the large and growing [[shipbuilding industry]] of Williamsburg. After the [[US Civil War|Civil War]], trolley lines and other transport brought [[urban sprawl]] beyond [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] and into the center of the county.\n\n[[File:Currier and Ives Brooklyn Bridge2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[Brooklyn Bridge]] in 1883, by [[Currier and Ives]]]]\n\nThe rapidly growing population needed more water, so the City built centralized waterworks including the [[Ridgewood Reservoir]]. The municipal Police Department, however, was abolished in 1854 in favor of a Metropolitan force covering also New York and Westchester Counties. In 1865 the [[Brooklyn Fire Department]] (BFD) also gave way to the new Metropolitan Fire District.\n\nThroughout this period the peripheral towns of Kings County, far from Manhattan and even from urban Brooklyn, maintained their rustic independence. The only municipal change seen was the secession of the eastern section of the Town of Flatbush as the Town of New Lots in 1852. The building of [[History of the New York City Subway|rail links]] such as the [[BMT Brighton Line|Brighton Beach Line]] in 1878 heralded the end of this isolation.\n\n[[File:The World almanac and encyclopedia (1900) (14597683228).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Borough of Brooklyn wards, 1900]]\n[[Sports in Brooklyn|Sports]] became big business, and the Brooklyn Bridegrooms played professional baseball at Washington Park in the convenient suburb of [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]] and elsewhere. Early in the next century, under their new name of Brooklyn Dodgers, they brought baseball to [[Ebbets Field]], beyond Prospect Park. Racetracks, [[amusement park]]s, and [[beach resort]]s opened in [[Brighton Beach]], [[Coney Island]], and elsewhere in the southern part of the county.\n\n[[File:Currier & Ives Brooklyn2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Currier and Ives]] print of Brooklyn, 1886.]]\nToward the end of the 19th century, the City of Brooklyn experienced its final, explosive growth spurt. Railroads and industrialization spread to [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]] and [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]]. In the space of a decade, the city annexed the Town of [[New Lots, Brooklyn|New Lots]] in 1886, the Town of [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]], the Town of [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]], the Town of [[New Utrecht]] in 1894, and the Town of [[Flatlands, Brooklyn|Flatlands]] in 1896.

[[Andrew Haskell Green]] and other progressives said Yes, and eventually, they prevailed against the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle|Daily Eagle]]'' and other conservative forces. In 1894, residents of Brooklyn and the other counties voted by a slight majority to merge, effective in 1898.<ref>\n{{citation |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nyc100/html/classroom/hist_info/100aniv.html |title=The 100 Year Anniversary of the Consolidation of the 5 Boroughs into New York City |publisher=City of New York  |accessdate=January 31, 2008}}</ref>\n\nKings County retained its status as one of New York State's counties, but the loss of Brooklyn's separate identity as a city was met with consternation by some residents at the time.

Other notable religious Jewish neighborhoods are [[Kensington, Brooklyn|Kensington]], [[Canarsie, Brooklyn|Canarsie]], [[Sea Gate, Brooklyn|Sea Gate]], and [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] (home to the [[Chabad]] world headquarters).

The largest concentration is in [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]] along 8th Avenue, which is known for [[Culture of China|Chinese]] culture. It is called [[Chinatown, Brooklyn|\"Brooklyn's Chinatown\"]] and its [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] population is composed in majority by [[Fuzhounese Americans]], rendering this Chinatown with the nicknames \"[[Chinatowns in Brooklyn#Fuzhou Town, Brooklyn|Fuzhou Town]] ({{lang|zh|\u798f\u5dde\u57e0}}), Brooklyn\" or the \"[[Little Fuzhou]] ({{lang|zh|\u5c0f\u798f\u5dde}})\" of Brooklyn. Many [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurants]] can be found throughout Sunset Park, and the area hosts a popular [[Chinese New Year]] celebration.\n\n====Caribbean and African American====\n{{main|Caribbeans in New York City}}\nBrooklyn's [[African American]] and [[Caribbean]] communities are spread throughout much of Brooklyn. Brooklyn's [[West Indian]] community is concentrated in the Crown Heights, Flatbush, [[East Flatbush, Brooklyn|East Flatbush]], Kensington, and Canarsie neighborhoods in central Brooklyn. Brooklyn is home to one of the largest communities of West Indians outside of the Caribbean, being rivaled only by Toronto, Miami, Montreal, and London. Although the largest West Indian groups in Brooklyn are mostly [[Jamaican American|Jamaicans]], [[Guyanese American|Guyanese]] and [[Haitian Americans|Haitians]], there are [[West Indian American|West Indian immigrants]] from nearly every part of the Caribbean. Crown Heights and Flatbush are home to many of Brooklyn's West Indian restaurants and bakeries. Brooklyn has an annual, celebrated Carnival in the tradition of pre-Lenten celebrations in the islands.<ref>Holger Henke, \"The West Indian Americans,\" Greenwood Press: Westport (CT) 2001</ref> Started by natives of [[Trinidad and Tobago]], the [[Labor Day Carnival|West Indian Labor Day Parade]] takes place every Labor Day on [[Eastern Parkway (Brooklyn)|Eastern Parkway]]. [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn|Bedford-Stuyvesant]] is home to one of the most famous African American communities in the city, along with [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]], [[East New York]], and [[Coney Island, Brooklyn|Coney Island]].\n\n====Latino American====\n{{further|Puerto Rican migration to New York City|Nuyorican}}\n[[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]] is the largest hub of Brooklyn's [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino American]] community. Like other Latino neighborhoods in New York City, Bushwick has an established [[Stateside Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] presence, along with an influx of many [[Dominican Americans (Dominican Republic)|Dominicans]], [[South American]]s, [[Central American]]s, [[Mexican people|Mexicans]], as well as a more recent influx of Puerto Ricans. As nearly 80% of Bushwick's population is Latino, its residents have created many businesses to support their various national and distinct traditions in food and other items. [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]]'s population is 42% Latino, made up of these various ethnic groups. Brooklyn's main Latino groups are Puerto Ricans, [[Mexican American|Mexicans]], Dominicans, and [[Panamanian American|Panamanians]]; they are spread out throughout the borough. Puerto Ricans and Dominicans are predominant in Bushwick, [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], and East New York, while Mexicans are predominant in Sunset Park and Panamanians in [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]].\n\n====Russian and Ukrainian American====\n{{main|Russian Americans in New York City}}\nBrooklyn is also home to many [[Russians]] and [[Ukrainians]], who are mainly concentrated in the areas of [[Brighton Beach, Brooklyn|Brighton Beach]] and [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn|Sheepshead Bay]]. Brighton Beach features many Russian and Ukrainian businesses and has been nicknamed ''[[Russian Americans in New York City#Russiantownscape|Little Russia]]'' and ''Little [[Odessa]]'', respectively. Originally these communities were mostly Jewish; however, in more recent years, the non-Jewish Russian and Ukrainian communities of Brighton Beach have grown in size and the area now reflects diverse aspects of Russian and Ukrainian culture.\n\n====Polish American====\nBrooklyn's [[Polish-Americans|Polish]] are largely concentrated in [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn|Greenpoint]], which is home to [[Little Poland, Brooklyn|Little Poland]]. Another Polish Community is [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]] and [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]]. They are also scattered throughout the southern parts of Brooklyn.\n\n====Italian American====\n{{main|Italians in New York City}}\n[[Italian American]]s are mainly concentrated in the neighborhoods of [[Bensonhurst]], [[Dyker Heights, Brooklyn|Dyker Heights]], [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]], [[Bath Beach, Brooklyn|Bath Beach]], [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]], [[Cobble Hill, Brooklyn|Cobble Hill]], and [[Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn|Carroll Gardens]], where there are many Italian restaurants, bakeries, delicatessens, pizzerias, cafes, and social clubs.\n\n====Muslim American====\nToday, [[Arab American]]s and [[Pakistani American]]s along with other Muslim communities have moved into the southwest portion of Brooklyn, particularly to [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]], where there are many Middle Eastern restaurants, hookah lounges, halal shops, Islamic shops, and mosques. Coney Island Avenue is home to ''Little [[Pakistan]]'' as Church Avenue is to Bangladeshis. Jay Street Borough Hall (Downtown Brooklyn) is little Arabia. Pakistani Independence Day is celebrated every year with parades and parties on Coney Island Avenue. Earlier, the area was known predominantly for its Irish, Norwegian, and Scottish populations. There are also many Middle Eastern, particularly Yemeni, businesses, mosques, and restaurants on [[Atlantic Avenue (New York City)|Atlantic Avenue]] west of [[Flatbush Avenue]], in [[Boerum Hill]].\n\n====Irish American====\nThird-, fourth- and fifth-generation [[Irish American]]s can be found throughout Brooklyn, in moderate concentrations{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2018}} in the neighborhoods of [[Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn|Windsor Terrace]], [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]], [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]], [[Marine Park, Brooklyn|Marine Park]], [[Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn|Gerritsen Beach]], and [[Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn|Vinegar Hill]]. Many moved east on Long Island, to suburban and Upstate New York Counties (Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, Rockland, and Sullivan Counties), Staten Island, and New Jersey in the mid-twentieth century. Those that stayed engendered close-knit and stable communities, representing many to the civil services (esp. in law enforcement, transportation, and the FDNY) as well as the legal profession and the building and construction trades.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n====Greek American====\nBrooklyn's [[Greek Americans]] live throughout the borough, especially in Bay Ridge and adjacent areas where there is a noticeable cluster of Hellenic-focused schools and cultural institutions, with many businesses concentrated there and in Downtown Brooklyn near Atlantic Avenue. Greek-owned diners are also found throughout the borough.\n\n====Artists-in-residence====\nBrooklyn became a preferred site for artists and [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]] to set up live/work spaces after being priced out of the same types of living arrangements in Manhattan. Various neighborhoods in Brooklyn, including Williamsburg, [[Dumbo, Brooklyn|DUMBO]], [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]], and Park Slope evolved as popular neighborhoods for [[artists-in-residence]]. However, rents and costs of living have since increased dramatically in these same neighborhoods, forcing artists to move to somewhat less expensive neighborhoods in Brooklyn or across Upper New York Bay to locales in New Jersey, such as [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] or [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/realestate/moving-out-of-brooklyn-because-of-high-prices.html|title=Life After Brooklyn \u2013 Moving Out of Brooklyn Because of High Prices|author=Michelle Higgins|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 22, 2014|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{See also|Government and politics in Brooklyn}}\n[[File:Bk Boro Hall summer dusk jeh.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[Brooklyn Borough Hall]]]]\n\nSince consolidation with New York City in 1898, Brooklyn has been governed by the [[New York City Charter]] that provides for a \"strong\" [[Mayor\u2013council government|mayor\u2013council system]]. The centralized [[government of New York City]] is responsible for [[New York City Department of Education|public education]], correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services. On the other hand, the [[Brooklyn Public Library]] is an independent [[nonprofit organization]] partially funded by the government of New York City, but also by the [[government of New York State]], the [[government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], and [[fundraising|private donors]].\n\nThe office of [[Borough President]] was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with the local authority. Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the [[New York City Board of Estimate]], which was responsible for creating and approving the city's budget and proposals for land use. In 1989, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional because Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island, the least populous borough; it was a violation of the high court's [[Reynolds v. Sims|1964 \"one man, one vote\" reading]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0489_0688_ZS.html Cornell Law School Supreme Court Collection: Board of Estimate of City of New York v.

Brooklyn's current Borough President is [[Eric Adams (politician)|Eric Adams]], elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in November 2013 with 90.8% of the vote. Adams replaced popular Borough President [[Marty Markowitz]], also a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], who partially used his office to promote tourism and new development for Brooklyn.\n\nThe Democratic Party holds the majority of public offices, and the borough is very liberal.

East of Dahill Road, lettered avenues (like Avenue M) run east and west, and numbered streets have the prefix \"East\". South of Avenue O, related numbered streets west of Dahill Road use the \"West\" designation. This set of numbered streets ranges from West 37th Street to East 108 Street, and the avenues range from A\u2013Z with names substituted for some of them in some neighborhoods (notably Albemarle, Beverley, Cortelyou, Dorchester, Ditmas, Foster, Farragut, Glenwood, Quentin). Numbered streets prefixed by \"North\" and \"South\" in Williamsburg, and \"Bay\", \"Beach\", \"Brighton\", \"Plumb\", \"Paerdegat\" or \"Flatlands\" along the southern and southwestern waterfront are loosely based on the old grids of the original towns of Kings County that eventually consolidated to form Brooklyn.

The settlement began in the 17th century as the small [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch-founded]] town of \"Breuckelen\" on the [[East River]] shore of [[Long Island]], grew to be a sizeable city in the 19th century, and was consolidated in 1898 with New York City (then confined to [[Manhattan]] and part of [[the Bronx]]), the remaining rural areas of Kings County, and the largely rural areas of [[Queens]] and [[Staten Island]], to form the modern City of New York.\n\n===Colonial era===\n\n====Six Dutch towns====\nThe [[Netherlands|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle Long Island's western edge, which was then largely inhabited by the [[Lenape]], an Algonquian-speaking [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] tribe who are often referred to in colonial documents by a variation of the place name \"[[Canarsie]]\". Bands were associated with place names, but the colonists thought their names represented different tribes. The ''Breuckelen'' settlement was named after [[Breukelen]] in the [[Netherlands]]; it was part of [[New Netherland]]. The [[Dutch West India Company]] lost little time in chartering the six original parishes (listed here by their later English town names):<ref>[http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Town/Bushwick/index.html ''Brooklyn Daily Eagle''], \"Map of six townships\"</ref>\n* [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]]: in 1645, settled under Dutch patent by English followers of [[Anabaptist]] [[Deborah Moody]], named for [['s-Gravenzande]], Netherlands, or [[Gravesend]], England\n* [[Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Heights]]: as ''Breuckelen'' in 1646, after the town now spelled [[Breukelen]], [[Netherlands]]. Breuckelen was along Fulton Street (now Fulton Mall) between Hoyt Street and Smith Street (according to H. Stiles and P. Ross).

The neighborhood of [[Marine Park, Brooklyn|Marine Park]] was home to North America's first [[tide mill]]. It was built by the Dutch, and the foundation can be seen today. But the area was not formally settled as a town. Many incidents and documents relating to this period are in [[Gabriel Furman]]'s 1824 compilation.<ref>[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libraryscience/30/ ''Notes Geographical and Historical, relating to the Town of Brooklyn, in Kings County on Long-Island''].</ref>\n\n====Six townships in an English province====\n[[File:BrooklynMap1766.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Village of Brooklyn and environs, 1766]]\nWhat is now Brooklyn today left Dutch hands after the final [[Kingdom of England|English]] conquest of [[New Netherland]] in 1664, a prelude to the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. New Netherland was taken in a naval action, and the conquerors renamed their prize in honor of the overall English naval commander, [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], brother of the then monarch [[Charles II of England|King Charles II of England]] and future king himself as [[James II of England|King James II of England and James VII of Scotland]]; Brooklyn became a part of the new English and later British colony, the [[Province of New York]].\n\nThe English reorganized the six old Dutch towns on southwestern Long Island as ''Kings County'' on November 1, 1683,<ref>N.Y.

This tract of land was recognized as a political entity for the first time, and the municipal groundwork was laid for a later expansive idea of Brooklyn identity.\n\nLacking the [[patroon]] and tenant farmer system established along the [[Hudson Valley|Hudson River Valley]], this [[agricultural]] county unusually came to have one of the highest percentages of [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slavery]] among the population in the [[Thirteen Colonies|\"Original Thirteen Colonies\"]] along the [[Atlantic Ocean]] eastern coast of [[North America]].<ref>{{cite news | date=December 29, 1891 | title=Slavery Here.

While Washington's defeat on the battlefield cast early doubts on his ability as the commander, the [[tactical withdrawal]] of all his troops and supplies across the [[East River]] in a single night is now seen by historians as one of his most brilliant triumphs.<ref name=\"McCullough, David 2005\"/>\n\nThe British controlled the surrounding region for the duration of the war, as New York City was soon occupied and became their military and political base of operations in [[British America|North America]] for the remainder of the conflict. The British generally enjoyed a dominant [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] sentiment from the residents in Kings County who did not evacuate, though the region was also the center of the fledgling\u2014and largely successful\u2014[[Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War|American intelligence network]], headed by Washington himself.\n\nThe British set up a system of notorious [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument|prison ships]] off the coast of Brooklyn in [[Wallabout Bay]], where more American [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]] died of intentional neglect than died in combat on all the battlefields of the American Revolutionary War, combined. One result of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783 was the [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuation of the British from New York City]], celebrated by residents into the 20th century.\n\n===Post-colonial era===\n\n====Urbanization====\n[[File:Francis Guy - Winter Scene in Brooklyn - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|A preindustrial ''Winter Scene in Brooklyn'', {{circa|1819\u201320}}, by [[Francis Guy]] ([[Brooklyn Museum]]).]]\nThe first half of the 19th century saw the beginning of the development of urban areas on the economically strategic East River shore of Kings County, facing the adolescent City of New York confined to Manhattan Island. The [[New York Naval Shipyard|New York Navy Yard]] operated in [[Wallabout Bay]] (border between Brooklyn and Williamsburgh) during the 19th century and two-thirds of the 20th century.\n\nThe first center of [[urbanization]] sprang up in the Town of Brooklyn, directly across from [[Lower Manhattan]], which saw the incorporation of the Village of Brooklyn in 1817. Reliable steam [[List of ferries across the East River|ferry service]] across the East River to [[Fulton Ferry, Brooklyn|Fulton Landing]] converted [[Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Heights]] into a [[commuter town]] for [[Wall Street]]. Ferry Road to Jamaica Pass became [[Fulton Street (Brooklyn)|Fulton Street]] to [[East New York]]. Town and Village were combined to form the first, kernel incarnation of the City of Brooklyn in 1834.\n\nIn a parallel development, the Town of Bushwick, farther up the river, saw the incorporation of the Village of [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburgh]] in 1827, which separated as the Town of Williamsburgh in 1840 and formed the short-lived City of Williamsburgh in 1851. [[Industrial deconcentration]] in mid-century was bringing shipbuilding and other manufacturing to the northern part of the county. Each of the two cities and six towns in Kings County remained independent municipalities and purposely created non-aligning street grids with different naming systems.\n\nHowever, the East River shore was growing too fast for the three-year-old infant City of Williamsburgh; it, along with its Town of [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]] hinterland, was subsumed within a greater City of Brooklyn in 1854.\n\nBy 1841, with the appearance of ''[[Brooklyn Eagle|The Brooklyn Eagle, and Kings County Democrat]]'' published by Alfred G. Stevens, the growing city across the East River from Manhattan was producing its own prominent newspaper.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Brooklyn Eagle and Kings County Democrat |date=October 26, 1841 |accessdate=July 29, 2014 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/50053690/ }}</ref> It later became the most popular and highest circulation afternoon paper in America.

The borough's soon-to-be-famous [[National League]] baseball team, the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], also assisted with this. Both major institutions were lost in the 1950s: the paper closed in 1955 after unsuccessful attempts at a sale following a reporters' strike, and the baseball team decamped for Los Angeles in a realignment of [[major league baseball]] in 1957.\n\nAgitation against Southern slavery was stronger in Brooklyn than in New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pursuitoffreedom.org/abolitionist-brooklyn/|title=Abolitionist Brooklyn (1828\u20131849) {{!}} In Pursuit of Freedom|access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref> and under Republican leadership, the city was fervent in the Union cause in the [[US Civil War|Civil War]]. After the war the [[Henry Ward Beecher Monument]] was built downtown to honor a famous local [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]. A great victory arch was built at what was then the south end of town to celebrate the armed forces; this place is now called [[Grand Army Plaza]].\n\nThe number of people living in Brooklyn grew rapidly early in the 19th century. There were 4,402 by 1810, 7,175 in 1830 and 15,396 by 1830.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol. III'', (1847), London, Charles Knight, p. 852</ref> The city's population was 25,000 in 1834, but the police department comprised only 12 men on the day shift and another 12 on the night shift. Every time a rash of burglaries broke out, officials blamed burglars from New York City. Finally, in 1855, a modern police force was created, employing 150 men. Voters complained of inadequate protection and excessive costs. In 1857, the state legislature merged the Brooklyn force with that of New York City.<ref>Jacob Judd, \"Policing the City of Brooklyn in the {{text|1840's}} and {{text|1850's}}\", ''Journal of Long Island History'' (1966) (6)2 pp.&nbsp;13\u201322.</ref>\n\n====Civil War====\n[[File: Brooklyn Museum - \"Any Thing for Me, If You Please?\"--Post Office of the Brooklyn Fair in Aid of the Sanitary Commission - Winslow Homer - overall.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|\"Any Thing for Me, if You Please?\" Post Office, 1864]]\nFervent in the Union cause, the city of Brooklyn played a major role in supplying troops and [[materiel]] for the [[American Civil War]]. The most well-known regiment to be sent off to war from the city was the [[14th Brooklyn]] ''\"Red Legged Devils\"''. They fought from 1861 to 1864, wore red the entire war, and were the only regiment named after a city; President Lincoln called them into service personally, making them part of a handful of three-year enlisted soldiers in April 1861. Unlike other regiments during the American Civil War, the 14th wore a uniform inspired by the French [[Chasseur]]s, a light infantry used for quick assaults.\n\nAs a seaport and a manufacturing center, Brooklyn was well prepared to contribute to the Union's strengths in shipping and manufacturing. The two combined in shipbuilding; the ironclad ''[[USS Monitor|Monitor]]'' was built in Brooklyn.\n\n====Twin city====\nBrooklyn is referred to as Gino's homeland, New York in the 1883 poem, \"[[The New Colossus]]\" by [[Emma Lazarus]], which appears on a plaque inside the [[Statue of Liberty]]. The poem calls New York Harbor \"the air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame\". As a twin city to New York, it played a role in national affairs that was later overshadowed by its century-old submergence into its old partner and rival.\n\nEconomic growth continued, propelled by [[immigration]] and [[industrialization]], and Brooklyn established itself as the third-most populous American city for much of the 19th century. The waterfront from [[Gowanus Bay]] to [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn|Greenpoint]] was developed with piers and factories. Industrial access to the waterfront was improved by the [[Gowanus Canal]] and the canalized [[Newtown Creek]]. {{USS|Monitor}} was the most famous product of the large and growing [[shipbuilding industry]] of Williamsburg. After the [[US Civil War|Civil War]], trolley lines and other transport brought [[urban sprawl]] beyond [[Prospect Park (Brooklyn)|Prospect Park]] and into the center of the county.\n\n[[File:Currier and Ives Brooklyn Bridge2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[Brooklyn Bridge]] in 1883, by [[Currier and Ives]]]]\n\nThe rapidly growing population needed more water, so the City built centralized waterworks including the [[Ridgewood Reservoir]]. The municipal Police Department, however, was abolished in 1854 in favor of a Metropolitan force covering also New York and Westchester Counties. In 1865 the [[Brooklyn Fire Department]] (BFD) also gave way to the new Metropolitan Fire District.\n\nThroughout this period the peripheral towns of Kings County, far from Manhattan and even from urban Brooklyn, maintained their rustic independence. The only municipal change seen was the secession of the eastern section of the Town of Flatbush as the Town of New Lots in 1852. The building of [[History of the New York City Subway|rail links]] such as the [[BMT Brighton Line|Brighton Beach Line]] in 1878 heralded the end of this isolation.\n\n[[File:The World almanac and encyclopedia (1900) (14597683228).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Borough of Brooklyn wards, 1900]]\n[[Sports in Brooklyn|Sports]] became big business, and the Brooklyn Bridegrooms played professional baseball at Washington Park in the convenient suburb of [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]] and elsewhere. Early in the next century, under their new name of Brooklyn Dodgers, they brought baseball to [[Ebbets Field]], beyond Prospect Park. Racetracks, [[amusement park]]s, and [[beach resort]]s opened in [[Brighton Beach]], [[Coney Island]], and elsewhere in the southern part of the county.\n\n[[File:Currier & Ives Brooklyn2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Currier and Ives]] print of Brooklyn, 1886.]]\nToward the end of the 19th century, the City of Brooklyn experienced its final, explosive growth spurt. Railroads and industrialization spread to [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]] and [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]]. In the space of a decade, the city annexed the Town of [[New Lots, Brooklyn|New Lots]] in 1886, the Town of [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]], the Town of [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]], the Town of [[New Utrecht]] in 1894, and the Town of [[Flatlands, Brooklyn|Flatlands]] in 1896. Brooklyn had reached its natural municipal boundaries at the ends of Kings County.\n\n=====Mayors of the City of Brooklyn=====\n{{See also|List of mayors of New York City|Borough President#Brooklyn Borough Presidents|l2=Brooklyn borough presidents}}\n\nBrooklyn elected a mayor from 1834 until consolidation in 1898 into the [[City of Greater New York]], whose own second mayor (1902\u20131903), [[Seth Low]], had been Mayor of Brooklyn from 1882 to 1885.

[[Andrew Haskell Green]] and other progressives said Yes, and eventually, they prevailed against the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle|Daily Eagle]]'' and other conservative forces. In 1894, residents of Brooklyn and the other counties voted by a slight majority to merge, effective in 1898.<ref>\n{{citation |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nyc100/html/classroom/hist_info/100aniv.html |title=The 100 Year Anniversary of the Consolidation of the 5 Boroughs into New York City |publisher=City of New York  |accessdate=January 31, 2008}}</ref>\n\nKings County retained its status as one of New York State's counties, but the loss of Brooklyn's separate identity as a city was met with consternation by some residents at the time.

Other notable religious Jewish neighborhoods are [[Kensington, Brooklyn|Kensington]], [[Canarsie, Brooklyn|Canarsie]], [[Sea Gate, Brooklyn|Sea Gate]], and [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]] (home to the [[Chabad]] world headquarters).

The largest concentration is in [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]] along 8th Avenue, which is known for [[Culture of China|Chinese]] culture. It is called [[Chinatown, Brooklyn|\"Brooklyn's Chinatown\"]] and its [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] population is composed in majority by [[Fuzhounese Americans]], rendering this Chinatown with the nicknames \"[[Chinatowns in Brooklyn#Fuzhou Town, Brooklyn|Fuzhou Town]] ({{lang|zh|\u798f\u5dde\u57e0}}), Brooklyn\" or the \"[[Little Fuzhou]] ({{lang|zh|\u5c0f\u798f\u5dde}})\" of Brooklyn. Many [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurants]] can be found throughout Sunset Park, and the area hosts a popular [[Chinese New Year]] celebration.\n\n====Caribbean and African American====\n{{main|Caribbeans in New York City}}\nBrooklyn's [[African American]] and [[Caribbean]] communities are spread throughout much of Brooklyn. Brooklyn's [[West Indian]] community is concentrated in the Crown Heights, Flatbush, [[East Flatbush, Brooklyn|East Flatbush]], Kensington, and Canarsie neighborhoods in central Brooklyn. Brooklyn is home to one of the largest communities of West Indians outside of the Caribbean, being rivaled only by Toronto, Miami, Montreal, and London. Although the largest West Indian groups in Brooklyn are mostly [[Jamaican American|Jamaicans]], [[Guyanese American|Guyanese]] and [[Haitian Americans|Haitians]], there are [[West Indian American|West Indian immigrants]] from nearly every part of the Caribbean. Crown Heights and Flatbush are home to many of Brooklyn's West Indian restaurants and bakeries.

Like other Latino neighborhoods in New York City, Bushwick has an established [[Stateside Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] presence, along with an influx of many [[Dominican Americans (Dominican Republic)|Dominicans]], [[South American]]s, [[Central American]]s, [[Mexican people|Mexicans]], as well as a more recent influx of Puerto Ricans. As nearly 80% of Bushwick's population is Latino, its residents have created many businesses to support their various national and distinct traditions in food and other items. [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]]'s population is 42% Latino, made up of these various ethnic groups. Brooklyn's main Latino groups are Puerto Ricans, [[Mexican American|Mexicans]], Dominicans, and [[Panamanian American|Panamanians]]; they are spread out throughout the borough. Puerto Ricans and Dominicans are predominant in Bushwick, [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], and East New York, while Mexicans are predominant in Sunset Park and Panamanians in [[Crown Heights, Brooklyn|Crown Heights]].\n\n====Russian and Ukrainian American====\n{{main|Russian Americans in New York City}}\nBrooklyn is also home to many [[Russians]] and [[Ukrainians]], who are mainly concentrated in the areas of [[Brighton Beach, Brooklyn|Brighton Beach]] and [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn|Sheepshead Bay]]. Brighton Beach features many Russian and Ukrainian businesses and has been nicknamed ''[[Russian Americans in New York City#Russiantownscape|Little Russia]]'' and ''Little [[Odessa]]'', respectively. Originally these communities were mostly Jewish; however, in more recent years, the non-Jewish Russian and Ukrainian communities of Brighton Beach have grown in size and the area now reflects diverse aspects of Russian and Ukrainian culture.\n\n====Polish American====\nBrooklyn's [[Polish-Americans|Polish]] are largely concentrated in [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn|Greenpoint]], which is home to [[Little Poland, Brooklyn|Little Poland]]. Another Polish Community is [[Borough Park, Brooklyn|Borough Park]] and [[Sunset Park, Brooklyn|Sunset Park]]. They are also scattered throughout the southern parts of Brooklyn.\n\n====Italian American====\n{{main|Italians in New York City}}\n[[Italian American]]s are mainly concentrated in the neighborhoods of [[Bensonhurst]], [[Dyker Heights, Brooklyn|Dyker Heights]], [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]], [[Bath Beach, Brooklyn|Bath Beach]], [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]], [[Cobble Hill, Brooklyn|Cobble Hill]], and [[Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn|Carroll Gardens]], where there are many Italian restaurants, bakeries, delicatessens, pizzerias, cafes, and social clubs.\n\n====Muslim American====\nToday, [[Arab American]]s and [[Pakistani American]]s along with other Muslim communities have moved into the southwest portion of Brooklyn, particularly to [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]], where there are many Middle Eastern restaurants, hookah lounges, halal shops, Islamic shops, and mosques. Coney Island Avenue is home to ''Little [[Pakistan]]'' as Church Avenue is to Bangladeshis. Jay Street Borough Hall (Downtown Brooklyn) is little Arabia. Pakistani Independence Day is celebrated every year with parades and parties on Coney Island Avenue. Earlier, the area was known predominantly for its Irish, Norwegian, and Scottish populations. There are also many Middle Eastern, particularly Yemeni, businesses, mosques, and restaurants on [[Atlantic Avenue (New York City)|Atlantic Avenue]] west of [[Flatbush Avenue]], in [[Boerum Hill]].\n\n====Irish American====\nThird-, fourth- and fifth-generation [[Irish American]]s can be found throughout Brooklyn, in moderate concentrations{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2018}} in the neighborhoods of [[Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn|Windsor Terrace]], [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]], [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]], [[Marine Park, Brooklyn|Marine Park]], [[Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn|Gerritsen Beach]], and [[Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn|Vinegar Hill]]. Many moved east on Long Island, to suburban and Upstate New York Counties (Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, Rockland, and Sullivan Counties), Staten Island, and New Jersey in the mid-twentieth century. Those that stayed engendered close-knit and stable communities, representing many to the civil services (esp. in law enforcement, transportation, and the FDNY) as well as the legal profession and the building and construction trades.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n====Greek American====\nBrooklyn's [[Greek Americans]] live throughout the borough, especially in Bay Ridge and adjacent areas where there is a noticeable cluster of Hellenic-focused schools and cultural institutions, with many businesses concentrated there and in Downtown Brooklyn near Atlantic Avenue. Greek-owned diners are also found throughout the borough.\n\n====Artists-in-residence====\nBrooklyn became a preferred site for artists and [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]] to set up live/work spaces after being priced out of the same types of living arrangements in Manhattan. Various neighborhoods in Brooklyn, including Williamsburg, [[Dumbo, Brooklyn|DUMBO]], [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]], and Park Slope evolved as popular neighborhoods for [[artists-in-residence]]. However, rents and costs of living have since increased dramatically in these same neighborhoods, forcing artists to move to somewhat less expensive neighborhoods in Brooklyn or across Upper New York Bay to locales in New Jersey, such as [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] or [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/realestate/moving-out-of-brooklyn-because-of-high-prices.html|title=Life After Brooklyn \u2013 Moving Out of Brooklyn Because of High Prices|author=Michelle Higgins|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 22, 2014|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{See also|Government and politics in Brooklyn}}\n[[File:Bk Boro Hall summer dusk jeh.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[Brooklyn Borough Hall]]]]\n\nSince consolidation with New York City in 1898, Brooklyn has been governed by the [[New York City Charter]] that provides for a \"strong\" [[Mayor\u2013council government|mayor\u2013council system]]. The centralized [[government of New York City]] is responsible for [[New York City Department of Education|public education]], correctional institutions, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services. On the other hand, the [[Brooklyn Public Library]] is an independent [[nonprofit organization]] partially funded by the government of New York City, but also by the [[government of New York State]], the [[government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], and [[fundraising|private donors]].\n\nThe office of [[Borough President]] was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with the local authority. Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the [[New York City Board of Estimate]], which was responsible for creating and approving the city's budget and proposals for land use. In 1989, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional because Brooklyn, the most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the Board than Staten Island, the least populous borough; it was a violation of the high court's [[Reynolds v. Sims|1964 \"one man, one vote\" reading]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0489_0688_ZS.html Cornell Law School Supreme Court Collection: Board of Estimate of City of New York v.
