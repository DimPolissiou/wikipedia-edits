Petty and Beauchamp were lapping [[Joe Weatherly]] at the finish.  Petty, Beauchamp, and Weatherly crossed the finish line three abreast with Weatherly on the outside, Beauchamp on the inside, and Petty in the middle. A [[photo finish]] in a race of that duration and speed seemed inconceivable and photo-finish cameras were not installed at the track. NASCAR initially declared Beauchamp the winner.  After reviewing photographs and newsreels of the finish for three days, the call was reversed, and Petty was awarded the win.  Petty received $19,050 for winning.  Ken Marriott was scored as the last place driver having completed one lap and won $100.<ref>{{Cite news|title=No. 5 most memorable Daytona 500: The photo finish|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/columns/story?id=2762491|date=February 15, 2007|first=Terry|last=Blount|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.|ESPN]]|accessdate=March 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.racing-reference.info/race?id=1959-03&series=W \"1959 Daytona 500\"]. Racing-Reference.info Retrieved 2009-09-16.</ref>\n\nIn 1960, [[Junior Johnson|Robert \"Junior\" Johnson]] won, despite running a slower, year-old car in a field of 68 cars, most in Daytona 500 history through the present day. Johnson made use of the [[drafting (aerodynamics)|draft]], then a little-understood phenomenon, to keep up with the leaders.\n\nAfter three years of being the best driver never to win the Daytona 500, [[Fireball Roberts|Glenn \"Fireball\" Roberts]] came to the 1962 edition race of the Daytona 500 on a hot roll, he won the American Challenge for winners of 1961 NASCAR events, the pole position for the Daytona 500, and the Twin-100-mile qualifier. He dominated the race, leading 144 of the 200 laps and finally won his first (and ultimately only) Daytona 500.\n\nIn 1963, it was [[Tiny Lund|DeWayne \"Tiny\" Lund]] who took the victory for the Wood Brothers, however the real drama began a couple weeks before the race when Lund helped pull 1961 winner [[Marvin Panch]] from a burning sportscar at a considerable risk to himself. As a result of his heroism, the Wood Brothers asked Lund to replace Panch in the Daytona 500 and Lund took the car to the winner's circle.\n\nDriving a potent [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] with the new [[Hemi]] engine, [[Richard Petty]] led 184 of the 200 laps to win the 1964 Daytona 500 going away. Plymouths ran 1-2-3 at the finish. The triumph was Petty's first on a super-speedway.\n\nThe first rain-shortened Daytona 500 was the 1965 event. Leader Marvin Panch and [[Fred Lorenzen]] made contact on Lap 129, as rain began to fall; Panch spun out, and Lorenzen won when the race was finally called on Lap 133. The 1966 Daytona 500, won by [[Richard Petty]], was also shortened, to 198 laps, due to rain.<ref>Bob Zeller, ''Daytona 500: An Official History'' (Phoenix: David Bull Publishing, 2002): 48-52.</ref>\n\n1967 saw [[Mario Andretti]] dominate the race. He led 112 of the 200 laps including the last 33 laps to capture his only win in the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]].\n\nThe 1968 race saw a duel involving [[Cale Yarborough]] and [[LeeRoy Yarbrough]]. For much of the day, both drivers traded the lead. With 5 laps to go, Yarborough made a successful slingshot pass on the third turn to take the lead from Yarbrough and never looked back as he won his first Daytona 500 by 1.3 seconds. LeeRoy Yarbrough would inflict the same treatment on [[Charlie Glotzbach]] the next year, winning the 1969 Daytona 500 on the last lap.\n\n===1970\u20131979===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2010}}\nThe 1970s opened with [[Cale Yarborough]] qualifying at pole with a {{convert|194.015|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} run. Fate played a major role in the 1970 race, claiming one driver after another as soon as the green flag fell. Richard Petty, then Yarborough who dropped out after leading 26 of the first 31 laps, Donnie Allison, and [[A. J. Foyt]] also dropped out of the race. Later in the race, [[Pete Hamilton]], an unknown driver prior to this race, was contested the lead with the likes of [[Charlie Glotzbach]] and [[David Pearson (NASCAR driver)|David Pearson]]. On lap 192, Hamilton passed Pearson for the lead, and although Pearson tried valiantly to regain the lead, it was Hamilton who took the checkered flag in front of the largest crowd to ever have seen the Daytona 500 (an estimated 103,800). It was the first of 4 victories Hamilton would have in his brief NASCAR career.\n\nThe 1972 race was called a One-Sided Daytona 500. A. J. Foyt cruised [[lanyard]] into the lead with about 300 miles to go and captured the victory. It was Foyt's sixth career Winston Cup Grand National victory, and it gave the famed Wood Brothers of Stuart, VA, their third Daytona 500 triumph. They had previously won with Tiny Lund in 1963 and Cale Yarborough in 1968. In the event punctuated by a weak field because of factory withdrawal, Foyt outlasted four rivals and beat runner-up Charlie Glotzbach by nearly two laps. Jim Vandiver was six laps down and finished third; Benny Parsons was fourth and James Hylton fifth. Only three caution flags for 17 laps interrupted Foyt's pace. He averaged 161.550&nbsp;mph\u2014an all-time record for the Daytona 500.\n\nDuring the start of the 1974 NASCAR season, many races had their distance cut ten percent in response to the [[1973 oil crisis]]. As a result, the 1974 Daytona 500, won by [[Richard Petty]] (his second straight, making him the first driver ever to do it), was shortened to 180 laps (450 miles), as symbolically, the race \"started\" on Lap 21. The Twin 125 qualifying races were also shortened to 45 laps (112.5 miles).<ref>Zeller, 84-87.</ref> Richard Petty overcame tough luck of his own and capitalized on the misfortunes of Donnie Allison to win his fifth Daytona 500. The 47-second triumph was petty's 155th in Winston Cup Grand National competition. A record 53 laps were run under the caution flag, which reduced Petty's average winning speed to 140.894&nbsp;mph.\n\nIn 1975, it appeared David Pearson was on his way to his first Daytona 500 victory as he built a sizable lead on second place [[Benny Parsons]] late in the race.  However, Richard Petty, who was several laps behind the leaders, and Parsons hooked up in a draft and began reeling in Pearson who was slowed by lapped traffic.  The key moment of the race occurred two laps from the end when contact with a backmarker sent Pearson spinning on the backstretch.  Parsons avoided the accident and went on to take the win.\n\nIn the 1976 500, [[Richard Petty]] was leading on the last lap when he was passed on the backstretch by David Pearson. Petty tried to turn under Pearson coming off the final corner, but didn't clear Pearson. The contact caused the drivers to spin into the grass in the infield just short of the finish line. Petty's car didn't start, but Pearson was able to keep his car running and limp over the finish line for the win. Many fans consider this finish to be the greatest in the history of NASCAR.\n\nFor Bobby Allison, the Daytona 500 prior to the 1978 race was not kind to him, in fact he came to the race with a 67-race winless streak but with 11 laps remaining, he pushed his [[Bud Moore Engineering|Bud Moore]] [[Ford]] around [[Buddy Baker]] to take the lead and never look back as he captured his first Daytona 500 win.\n\nThe [[1979 Daytona 500]] was the first {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=on}} race to be broadcast live on national television, airing on [[CBS Sports|CBS]], whose audience was increased in much of the Eastern and Midwestern USA due to a blizzard. (The [[Indianapolis 500]] was only broadcast on tape delay that evening in this era; most races were broadcast only through the final quarter to half of the race, as was the procedure for ABC's Championship Auto Racing broadcasts; with the new CBS contract, the network and NASCAR agreed to a full live broadcast.) That telecast introduced in-car and low-level track-side cameras, which has now become standard in all sorts of automotive racing broadcasts. A final lap crash and subsequent fight between leaders [[Cale Yarborough]] and [[Donnie Allison]] (along with Donnie's brother [[Bobby Allison]]) brought national (if unwelcome) publicity to NASCAR, with the added emphasis of a snowstorm that bogged down much of the northeastern part of the United States. Donnie Allison was leading the race on the final lap with Yarborough drafting him tightly. As Yarborough attempted a slingshot pass at the end of the backstretch, Allison attempted to block him. Yarborough refused to give ground and as he pulled alongside Allison, his left side tires left the pavement and went into the wet and muddy infield grass. Yarborough lost control of his car and contacted Allison's car halfway down the backstretch. As both drivers tried to regain control, their cars made contact several more times before finally locking together and crashing into the outside wall in turn three. After the cars settled in the grass, Donnie Allison and Yarborough began to argue. After they had talked it out, Bobby Allison, who was lapped at that point, pulled over, began defending his brother, and a fight broke out. Richard Petty, who was over half a lap behind at the time, went on to win; with the brawl in the infield, the television audience scarcely noticed. The story was the talk of the water cooler the next day, even making the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' Sports section. NASCAR, as a national sport, had finally arrived after years of moonshine runners.\n\n===1980\u20131989===\n*'''[[1980 Daytona 500|1980]]''': [[Buddy Baker]] won the fastest Daytona 500 in history, at 177.602&nbsp;mph (285.809&nbsp;km/h).\n*'''[[1981 Daytona 500|1981]]''': With 24 laps to go, [[Richard Petty]] came to the pits for his final scheduled pit stop. Instead of changing tires, the team gambled and only took on fuel. Petty shocked the other drivers as he returned to the track in the lead. Petty became the first driver to win the Daytona 500 in three different decades.\n*'''[[1982 Daytona 500|1982]]''': In the early laps of the 1982 race, Bobby Allison's bumper flew off, allowing his No. 88 Buick Regal to go faster, in an incident known as \"Bumpergate\". Allison won the 1982 Daytona 500 in spite of this. It was also the first Daytona 500 chosen to be the first race of the NASCAR season.\n*'''[[1983 Daytona 500|1983]]''': [[Cale Yarborough]] was the first driver to run a qualifying lap over 200&nbsp;mph (320&nbsp;km/h) at Daytona in his No. 28 [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]. However, on his second of two qualifying laps, Yarborough crashed and flipped his car in turn four. The car had to be withdrawn, and the lap did not count. Despite the crash, Yarborough drove a back-up car (a [[Pontiac LeMans]]) to victory, taking the lead from Buddy Baker on the last lap with a duplicate of the pass he attempted on Donnie Allison in 1979.\n*'''[[1984 Daytona 500|1984]]''': [[Cale Yarborough]] completed a lap of 201.848&nbsp;mph (324.828&nbsp;km/h), officially breaking the {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} barrier at Daytona. He won the race for the second year in a row, and fourth time in his career, with the identical last-lap pass, this time outpacing [[Darrell Waltrip]].\n*'''[[1985 Daytona 500|1985]]''': [[Bill Elliott]] dominated the race, and by lap 140, was close to lapping the entire field except for second place. During a pit stop, NASCAR officials held him in the pit area in order to repair a supposed broken headlight assembly. The two-minute pit stop dropped him to third, barely clinging to the lead lap. Elliott made up the deficit mostly under green. Elliott survived a late race caution and a final lap restart to win his first Daytona 500. Elliott would go on to win the first [[Winston Million]].\n*'''[[1986 Daytona 500|1986]]''': The race that came down to the final 70 laps (all run under green); a two-car race involving [[Dale Earnhardt]] and [[Geoff Bodine]]. Earnhardt led for 10 laps while Bodine led for 60. With 3 laps to go, Earnhardt was forced to make a pit stop for a \"splash 'n go\". However, as Earnhardt left the pits he burned a piston, allowing Bodine to cruise to victory by 11.26 seconds.\n*'''[[1987 Daytona 500|1987]]''': [[Bill Elliott]] qualified for the pole position at an all-time Daytona record of 210.364&nbsp;mph (338.532&nbsp;km/h). He had already won convincingly in the 1985 race, and won his second Daytona 500 in 1987 in similarly dominating fashion.\n*'''[[1988 Daytona 500|1988]]''': [[Restrictor plate]]s were mandated to reduce dangerously high speeds at Daytona and its sister track, [[Talladega Speedway]].  The race began despite uncertainty about how well these would work.  Eventually, [[Bobby Allison]] and his son [[Davey Allison]] finished one-two and celebrated together in Victory Lane. Bobby Allison thus became the oldest driver to win the Daytona 500.  The race is also remembered for [[Richard Petty]]'s wild accident on lap 106. Petty spun, became airborne and tumbled along a large section of [[catch fence]] before his car came to a stop. The car was then torn nearly in half from hits by [[A. J. Foyt]] and [[Brett Bodine]].  Petty escaped without serious injury.  Restrictor plates remain in use at Daytona and Talladega to this day despite a disposition to create [[Oval track racing#Pack racing|pack racing]] and a phenomenon known as [[The Big One (NASCAR)|The Big One]].\n*'''[[1989 Daytona 500|1989]]''': [[Darrell Waltrip]] finally won the Daytona 500 after 17 attempts. (Coincidentally, the car he drove to victory, the [[Tide Ride]], wore number 17.) Waltrip amazingly stretched his fuel for the last 53 laps, meanwhile, most of his competitors were forced to pit. Waltrip ran out of gas as he pulled into Victory Lane. Fans loudly cheered the childlike exuberance of Waltrip's victory celebration. As he was being interviewed by CBS pit reporter [[Mike Joy]], Waltrip shouted, \"I won the Daytona 500! I won the Daytona 500!\" Shortly after, an exuberant Waltrip performed an \"[[Ickey Shuffle]]\" dance in Victory Lane, and ruined his helmet spiking it to the ground.\n\n===1990\u20131999===\n*'''[[1990 Daytona 500|1990]]''': After several years of futility, [[Dale Earnhardt]] appeared headed for certain victory until a series of events in the closing laps. On lap 193 [[Geoff Bodine]] spun in the first turn, causing the third and final caution of the race. All of the leaders pitted except [[Derrike Cope]], who stayed out to gain track position. On the lap 195 restart, Earnhardt re-took the lead. On the final lap, going into turn three, Earnhardt ran over a [[bell housing]] from the blown engine of [[Rick Wilson (NASCAR)|Rick Wilson]]'s car. He blew a tire, slowed suddenly, and veered out of the groove, allowing the relatively unknown [[Derrike Cope|Cope]] to slip by and take his first career win in a major upset.<ref>{{cite web | title = NASCAR.com&nbsp;\u2013 The 1990 Daytona 500 - July 28, 2003 | url = http://www.nascar.com/2002/kyn/history/races/02/02/90daytona500/ | accessdate = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008 | url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070817224950/http://www.nascar.com/2002/kyn/history/races/02/02/90daytona500/ | archivedate = August 17, 2007 | df =  }}</ref>\n*'''[[1991 Daytona 500|1991]]''': [[Dale Earnhardt]]'s Daytona 500 frustrations continued as [[Ernie Irvan]] passed Earnhardt with six laps to go to. Earnhardt's day started out on a sour note, as he hit a [[seagull]] in the opening laps. The damage inflicted by the bird affected the aerodynamics, and damaged the radiator, causing high water temperatures. Ultimately, Earnhardt spun out with two laps remaining and collected [[Davey Allison]] and [[Kyle Petty]]. Irvan coasted on fumes on the final lap as the race ended under the caution flag. The race was dominated by complex pit stop rules, implemented to improve safety in the pit area.\n*'''[[1992 Daytona 500|1992]]''': [[Davey Allison]] dominated the second half en route to his lone Daytona 500 victory. He avoided the \"Big One\" on lap 92 and went on to lead the final 102 laps. To date, Allison is the last driver to win the Daytona 500 after leading the halfway lap.\n*'''[[1993 Daytona 500|1993]]''': Rookie [[Jeff Gordon]] made a splash, winning one of the Budweiser Duels, and leading the opening lap of the race. He would finish in the top five. On lap 170, a frightening wreck occurred that saw [[Rusty Wallace]] flip over multiple times on the back straightaway. With two laps to go, [[Dale Earnhardt]] was leading Gordon and [[Dale Jarrett]]. Using a push from fourth place [[Geoff Bodine]], Jarrett battled into the lead with one lap to go. In the broadcast booth, his father and former Cup champion [[Ned Jarrett]] became his son's biggest fan on national TV. It was the fourth time Earnhardt had been leading the Daytona 500 with less than ten laps to go, but failed to win.\n*'''[[1994 Daytona 500|1994]]''': After the deaths of [[Davey Allison]] and [[Alan Kulwicki]], the Cup circuit experienced several team/driver changes for 1994. In the offseason, [[Sterling Marlin]] landed in [[Ernie Irvan]]'s former ride at [[Morgan-McClure Motorsports]].  Between father ([[Coo Coo Marlin|Coo Coo]]) and son (Sterling), the Marlin family was 0-for-443 in Winston Cup starts. Marlin gambled on fuel, and was able to complete the final 59 laps on his tank of fuel to win his first career Cup victory. The win, however, was overshadowed by tragedy earlier in Speedweeks, as [[Neil Bonnett]] and [[Rodney Orr]] were killed in practice crashes.\n*'''[[1995 Daytona 500|1995]]''': [[Sterling Marlin]] became the first driver since [[Cale Yarborough]], and only third overall, to win back-to-back Daytona 500s. During a late caution, Marlin stayed out in the lead, while many of the leaders pitted for new tires. [[Dale Earnhardt]] dramatically charged from 14th to 2nd, but Marlin managed to hold him off on the final lap, despite running on old tires. To date, Marlin is the last driver to have won back-to-back Daytona 500s.\n*'''[[1996 Daytona 500|1996]]''': [[Dale Jarrett]] won his second Daytona 500 in four years, again holding off [[Dale Earnhardt]], who finished second for the third time in four years.\n*'''[[1997 Daytona 500|1997]]''': [[Jeff Gordon]] became the youngest driver to win the Daytona 500. Gordon and his [[Hendrick Motorsports]] teammates [[Terry Labonte]] and [[Ricky Craven]] ganged up on race leader [[Bill Elliott]] during the final ten laps. The race ended under the caution flag, as the teammates grabbed a 1-2-3 finish.\n*'''[[1998 Daytona 500|1998]]''': [[Dale Earnhardt]] finally won the Daytona 500 after 20 years of trying. Though Earnhardt had usually been a strong competitor in the Daytona 500, mechanical problems, crashes or bad luck had prevented him from winning the race. In 1998, however, Earnhardt was leading when [[Lake Speed]] and [[John Andretti]] made contact on Lap 198, causing the race to end under caution. After his victory, a joyous Earnhardt drove slowly down pit road, where members of other race teams had lined up to give him handshakes and high-fives. The victory was widely celebrated, even by people who weren't his fans, and was a defining moment in Earnhardt's career and legacy.<ref>{{cite web |title=NASCAR.com - 1998: A deserving win for Dale&nbsp;\u2013 March 19, 2003 |url=http://www.nascar.com/2003/kyn/history/daytona/02/11/daytona_1998/index.html |accessdate=2008-02-20 |year=2008 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013083928/http://www.nascar.com/2003/kyn/history/daytona/02/11/daytona_1998/index.html |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }}</ref> [[Mike Joy]], who was play-by-play announcer for [[NASCAR on CBS|CBS]]'s broadcast in 1998 (his first play-by-play call of the Daytona 500) called the win \"the most anticipated moment in racing\".\n*'''[[1999 Daytona 500|1999]]''': [[Jeff Gordon]] grabbed his second Daytona 500 win using drafting help from [[Dale Earnhardt]] to pull off a daring three-wide pass on [[Rusty Wallace]] and [[Mike Skinner (NASCAR)|Mike Skinner]] with 10 laps remaining.  Gordon then managed to hold off a determined Earnhardt to earn the victory. A wreck on lap 135 saw future champion [[Dale Jarrett]] flip over twice in turn 3.\n\n===2000\u20132009===\n*'''[[2000 Daytona 500|2000]]''': [[Johnny Benson]] nearly pulled off an upset win, leading in the late stages of the race. Polesitter [[Dale Jarrett]], however, made the winning pass on a restart with only four laps remaining. Jarrett led a pack of three Ford drivers to gang up and nudge Benson in turn 2, then draft past him on the backstretch. It was Jarrett's third Daytona 500 victory. The race was widely criticized by media and fans for being uncompetitive due to a restrictive aerodynamic rules package. [[Dale Earnhardt]] later complained to the media, \"[The rules] took NASCAR Winston Cup racing and made it some of the sorriest racing. They took racing out of the hands of the drivers and the crews. We can't adjust and make our cars drive like we want. They just killed the racing at Daytona.

However, the race was also one of the cleanest, as there were only three caution flags (one of which temporarily was a red flag) in the entire race. A crash on the back straightaway on lap 173 eliminated eighteen cars in spectacular fashion and resulted in the race being red-flagged temporarily for cleanup. [[Tony Stewart]] took the worst ride, as his car went over [[Robby Gordon]] and flipped end-over-end before coming to a rest in the infield. [[Kurt Busch]] made his Daytona 500 debut driving in the No. 97 Roush Ford. [[Michael Waltrip]], making his first start for [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.|DEI]] was leading the race on the final lap, with teammate [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] second. Team owner Dale Earnhardt (driving his familiar [[Richard Childress Racing|RCR]] entry) was running third, blocking for his two drivers. In turn 4, Earnhardt lost control after contact from [[Sterling Marlin]], and crashed into the outside wall, taking [[Ken Schrader]] with him. Earnhardt suffered a fatal [[basilar skull fracture]], at the same time his team cars were crossing the finish line 1st-2nd.<ref>{{cite web | title = Jayski's Silly Season Site&nbsp;\u2013 Race Info Page | url = http://www.jayski.com/next/2001/2001daytona500.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095714/http://www.jayski.com/next/2001/2001daytona500.htm | archive-date = 2007-09-29 | url-status = dead}}</ref> The tragedy ushered in a new era of safety in NASCAR. The 2001 race also marked the beginning of NASCAR's new television contract with [[Fox NASCAR|Fox]].\n*'''[[2002 Daytona 500|2002]]''': [[Sterling Marlin]] was battling [[Jeff Gordon]] for the lead when they made contact, sending Gordon's car spinning, and triggering a multi-car crash. NASCAR red-flagged the race so it would not finish under caution, and stopped the field momentarily on the backstretch. Concerned about a damaged right front fender, Marlin jumped out of his car and started pulling the fender away from the tire. As working on the car is prohibited during red flag conditions, Marlin was penalized, and sent to the tail end of the field for the restart. [[Ward Burton]] survived the wacky last ten laps, and posted the biggest victory of his career.\n*'''[[2003 Daytona 500|2003]]''': [[Michael Waltrip]] became a two-time winner after the race was shortened to 109 laps due to rain.<ref>{{cite web | title = 2003 Daytona 500 - Racing-Reference.info | url = http://racing-reference.info/race?id=2003-01&series=W | accessdate = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070309044703/http://www.racing-reference.info/race?id=2003-01&series=W | archive-date = 2007-03-09 | url-status = dead}}</ref> It was the shortest ever recorded Daytona 500.\n*'''[[2004 Daytona 500|2004]]''': [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] and [[Tony Stewart]] dominated the race, combining to lead 156 of 200 laps. With twenty laps to go, Earnhardt, Jr. got past Stewart in turn 3 without drafting help, and won the race exactly six years to the date after his father's celebrated win.\n[[File:NASCAR practice.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Practice for the 2004 Daytona 500.]]\n*'''[[2005 Daytona 500|2005]]''': The start time was changed, allowing the race to finish under the lights at dusk. [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] made a popular charge to the front on lap 197, but made his move too soon, and [[Jeff Gordon]] slipped by to re-take the lead. In the first use of the [[green-white-checker finish]] rule in the Daytona 500, Gordon held off Earnhardt, Jr. to win his third Daytona 500.\n*'''[[2006 Daytona 500|2006]]''': During post-qualifying inspection, [[Chad Knaus]] was ejected for an illegal rear window on the [[Hendrick Motorsports]] No. 48 car.  During the race, [[Tony Stewart]] aggressively blocked [[Matt Kenseth]] going into turn 3 on lap 106, sending Kenseth into a dangerous spin in front of the entire field. Misty rain and drizzle lasted most of the race, but did not affect the green flag conditions. The No. 48 team, with [[Jimmie Johnson]] driving and [[Darian Grubb]] as crew chief for the first of four races following Knaus' ejection and subsequent suspension, won after a green-white-checkered finish.\n*'''[[2007 Daytona 500|2007]]''': Nearing the end, [[Mark Martin]] was leading, looking for his first Daytona victory. A wreck in the final five laps that ended Dale Earnhardt, Jr.'s run brought out the yellow, and set up a green-white-checker finish, [[Kevin Harvick]] drove from 5th to 2nd in the final two turns. As Harvick approached Martin exiting turn 4, a huge wreck erupted behind them. Martin and Harvick drag-raced to the checkered flag with Harvick claiming victory by 0.02 seconds, the 4th closest finish in NASCAR history. Most of the rest of the field crashed across the finish line. Some controversy surrounded the finish since no caution flag was thrown, and there is disputed visual evidence that suggests that Martin would have been declared winner if the caution flag had come out.\n[[File:Daytona 2008 Earnhardt.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Start of the [[2008 Daytona 500]]. The inside cars are [[Jimmie Johnson]] (No. 48), [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] (No. 88), and [[Reed Sorenson]] (No. 41). The outside cars are [[Michael Waltrip]] (No. 55) and [[Denny Hamlin]] (No. 11).]]\n*'''[[2008 Daytona 500|2008]]''': The celebrated 50th running of the Daytona 500 was the first using NASCAR's [[Car of Tomorrow]]. It also marked the first race under the \"Sprint Cup Series\" banner, following the merger of [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] with [[Nextel Communications|Nextel]] in 2006. The first 150 laps were mostly caution free, with only two yellow flags thrown for debris. But the final 20 laps saw three crashes. On the final restart on lap 197, [[Tony Stewart]] stormed past [[Jeff Burton]] into the lead. On the final lap down the back straightaway, Stewart dove to the bottom to pick up drafting help from his teammate Kyle Busch. This move proved to be disastrous as it opened the door for [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]], who surged to the front and took the checkered flag.\n*'''[[2009 Daytona 500|2009]]''': The race was called on account of rain with 48 laps remaining. The leader at the time of the red flag, [[Matt Kenseth]], was declared the winner, his first Daytona 500 win in ten attempts and the first win for [[Roush Fenway Racing|Roush]]. Kenseth led only one lap under green.\n\n===2010\u2013present===\n*'''[[2010 Daytona 500|2010]]''': After six consecutive years of moving the start time further from 1&nbsp;pm to 3:30&nbsp;pm by 2009 to reach a prime-time finish, NASCAR and Fox agreed to return the race to a 1&nbsp;pm ET start as part of a uniform agreement on start times of 1&nbsp;pm, 3 PM, or 7:30&nbsp;pm for the majority of NASCAR Cup Series races during the season, ending what had become a nearly-standard 2&nbsp;pm ET start time for Eastern and Central time zone races during the season.  An aging asphalt surface, coupled with cool weather and heavy precipitation leading up the race, saw a huge, dangerous, pothole develop on the track in turn 2. Two red flag periods totaling nearly 2 and a half hours delayed the proceedings, as track crew attempted to fix the damage. Officials eventually filled the hole with Bondo, and the race resumed, finishing in prime-time. During the second green-white-checker attempt, [[Jamie McMurray]] passed [[Greg Biffle]] and [[Kevin Harvick]] on the 207th lap, holding off [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] to win.\n*'''[[2011 Daytona 500|2011]]''': After the embarrassing pothole incident of 2010, the [[Daytona International Speedway]] was completely repaved for the 2011 season, the first time since 1978. Since this race marked the tenth anniversary of the death of Dale Earnhardt, the third lap of the race was a \"silent lap\" (previously used in Earnhardt's memory during the 2001 season, meaning the TV and radio announcers were silent during the entire lap, and fans held up three fingers in reference to Earnhardt's car number). Fittingly, [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] won the pole position, but started last because of a crash during Wednesday practice before the qualifying races. The larger controversy was the two-car tandem racing, which had been proven at Talladega Superspeedway in 2009 on occasion, and the two-car tandem had been much faster than the more traditional multiple-car packs, forcing NASCAR to adopt pressure relief valves in an attempt to force the cars to overheat, forcing the cars to split from the two-car tandems after a short time.  On lap 131, [[Matt Kenseth]] demonstrated the quality of the new safety devices when he was turned into the wall from a push by [[Greg Biffle]] as hard if not harder than Dale Earnhardt did 10 years previous, and getting out of his car on his own power immediately after. 20-year-old [[Trevor Bayne]], in his first Daytona 500 start and only running a partial Cup schedule in 2011, and making just his second career NASCAR Cup Series start, held off [[Carl Edwards]], [[David Gilliland]] and [[Bobby Labonte]] to win the race and become the youngest Daytona 500 winner, and second-youngest to win a Cup race (the youngest being [[Joey Logano]], who won a rain-shortened New Hampshire event at nineteen years, one month and four days old). The win also tied the record for fewest starts by a driver before winning his first Cup race (two starts, held by [[Jamie McMurray]], who oddly also pulled the trick in his pre-rookie season, but as a substitute for an injured Sterling Marlin)\n*'''[[2012 Daytona 500|2012]]''': As a result of the NFL moving the Super Bowl into the first Sunday of February permanently in 2004, and eventually the 2010 race having a condensed first weekend (practice, qualifying, and the ARCA and special race being moved to Saturday in order to make Super Bowl day an off-day), NASCAR decided to move the Daytona 500 back to the Sunday of or after Washington's Birthday (February 22, but not the federally observed day), which February 26 in 2012.  Rain, however delayed the race a day (forcing the originally-planned honorary starter [[John Cena]] to leave for Portland for a [[WWE]] commitment), originally planning to reschedule the race for Monday afternoon at 12 noon EST.   With radar being inconsistent, and the introduction of the new vacuum-based Air Titan system being discussed, Fox and NASCAR agreed to scrub the noon start in favour of a 7&nbsp;pm start that Monday night, resulting in the first primetime Daytona 500 start (but the third Daytona 500 to reach primetime). The race is best remembered for the incident on lap 160, when [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] crashed into a jet dryer in turn 3 under caution, sparking a lengthy red flag as crews put out the resulting fire and repaired the damage. The race, scheduled to begin at 1&nbsp;pm EST on Sunday afternoon, ended at approximately 1&nbsp;am EST Tuesday morning, leading the event to possibly be known as the \"36 hours of Daytona\". [[Matt Kenseth]] held off [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] and [[Greg Biffle]] over the last 40 laps to win his second Daytona 500 and first Daytona 500 to go the distance. Kenseth was the first repeat winner in the Daytona 500 since [[Michael Waltrip]]'s rain-shortened 2003 race. Besides Montoya's accident with the jet dryer, there were three large crashes in the race itself: one on lap 2 involving five cars, one on lap 188 involving seven cars, and one on lap 196 involving eight cars.  It was the first time the Daytona 500 reached last night television.\n*'''[[2013 Daytona 500|2013]]''': This was the first race with NASCAR's new redesigned Generation 6 body. The big highlight was that rookie [[Danica Patrick]] won the pole, the first woman to win a pole in a NASCAR Cup Series race or the Daytona 500. She also was the first woman to lead laps under green flag conditions in the race. [[Matt Kenseth]], now driving for [[Joe Gibbs Racing]], dominated the first 3/4ths of the race before he and [[Kyle Busch]] ended their days with engine failures. Two crashes in turn 1 eliminated a number of cars from contention. In the final laps, [[Jimmie Johnson]] and [[Brad Keselowski]] were battling for the lead. On the last restart, Johnson pulled away, holding off [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] and [[Mark Martin]] to win his second Daytona 500. This marked the first time Johnson had finished better than 27th in this race since winning in 2006, and first win in the 500 for the 2014 Chevrolet SS, which was a [[captive import]] and rebrand of Australian manufacturer [[Holden]]'s [[Holden VF Commodore|new VF Commodore]]. It was also Johnson's 400th career start.\n*'''[[2014 Daytona 500|2014]]''': For the second year in a row, a rookie won the pole position for the Daytona 500, in this case [[Austin Dillon]] in his first ride in the newly renumbered No. 3 Chevrolet SS for [[Richard Childress Racing]], the first time the No. 3 had been used in a NASCAR Cup Series race since [[Dale Earnhardt]]'s death (the car had been No. 29 with its previous driver, [[Kevin Harvick]], who moved to [[Stewart-Haas Racing]] for 2014). The race is also nicknamed the Ten Hours of Daytona, as the green flag was dropped at 1:30&nbsp;pm and the cars took the checkered flag just after 11:30&nbsp;pm EST, due to a lengthy 6-hour 22-minute delay just 39 laps into the race for thunderstorms and a tornado warning in the area.  Dillon started off leading the first lap, but faded back afterwards. [[Denny Hamlin]], [[Kurt Busch]], [[Kyle Busch]] and [[Paul Menard]] were the strongest cars during the first 40 laps. [[Martin Truex, Jr.]], who had switched to a backup car after a last-lap crash during his Duel, was the first driver out, blowing an engine five laps before the red flag. When the race restarted around 8:45&nbsp;pm EST, the race saw much more intense competition due to cooler track temperatures and increased tire grip. Although the threat of rain became persistent after lap 150, the storm bands stalled long enough to allow the race to run the full distance. In the last sixty laps, the lead changed hands primarily between [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] and the Roush Fenway Fords of [[Carl Edwards]] and [[Greg Biffle]]. A five-car crash at the back of the field with seven laps to go set the field up for a two lap shootout on the final restart. Earnhardt, Jr. held off [[Denny Hamlin]], [[Jeff Gordon]] and [[Brad Keselowski]] over the last two laps, ending when a six-car crash in Turn 4 resulted in a yellow chequer finish, giving Earnhardt his second Daytona 500, exactly ten years and one week after he won [[2004 Daytona 500|his first 500]]. This was the third straight Daytona 500 to be won by a past winner of the race, after Kenseth in 2012 and Johnson in 2013, and the third Daytona 500 won by a car with the number No. 88 (as [[Dale Jarrett]] won the 1996 and 2000 races with the No. 88 for Yates Racing). Thanks to the introduction of a slightly taller rear spoiler to increase drag and downforce in the cars following criticism of a lack of green-flag passing in the previous year's 500, there were 19 leaders and 43 lead changes overall during the race.\n* '''[[2015 Daytona 500|2015]]''': The race had seven caution flags and was extended to 203 laps and {{convert|507.5|miles|km}} due to a [[green-white-checkered finish]]. [[Joey Logano]] won the race, giving [[Team Penske]] a second Daytona 500 victory. [[Kevin Harvick]] finished second; [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] finished third; [[Denny Hamlin]] finished fourth, and [[Jimmie Johnson]] finished fifth, [[Casey Mears]] finished sixth, [[Clint Bowyer]] finished seventh; [[Martin Truex, Jr.]] finished eighth; [[Kasey Kahne]] finished ninth, and [[Greg Biffle]] finished 10th. [[Jeff Gordon]], running his final full Cup season, won his second pole for the Daytona 500 (his first since the [[1999 Daytona 500|1999]] race) and he also led the most laps with 87; he finished 33rd after being caught up in a last-lap accident.  Neither Busch brother competed in this race, as Kurt was suspended for domestic issues and Kyle was injured in a crash during the previous day's Xfinity Series opener.\n*'''[[2016 Daytona 500|2016]]''': Rookie [[Chase Elliott]] started the race from the pole position, in the first race now-Fox commentator Jeff Gordon wasn't driving the Hendrick Motorsports No. 24. Driver [[Denny Hamlin]] led 95 laps during the race and passed leader [[Matt Kenseth]] on the last lap. Hamlin would then beat [[Martin Truex Jr.]] by 0.010 seconds, which would become the closest finish in the Daytona 500.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cain|first1=Holly|title=DENNY HAMLIN WINS THRILLING DAYTONA 500|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2016/2/21/daytona-500-denny-hamlin-race-recap-sprint-cup-series.html|website=nascar.com|publisher=nascar.com|date=21 February 2016|accessdate=23 February 2016}}</ref>  Hamlin's victory is the first Daytona 500 victory by a Toyota, in the first points-paying race after teammate Kyle Busch used an injury waiver to become the first Cup champion to win driving a Toyota. Hamlin became the first driver since Davey Allison in 1992 to lead the halfway lap and win the race.\n*'''[[2017 Daytona 500|2017]]''': [[Kurt Busch]], in Stewart-Haas' first race driving Fords and with [[Clint Bowyer]] now driving retired team co-owner Tony Stewart's No. 14, won the race, the first using NASCAR's new stage racing format and damage policy.  The Big One happened shortly before the end of the second stage, eliminating both Kyle Busch and Dale Earnhardt, Jr., the latter in his final Daytona 500, among others.\n*'''[[2018 Daytona 500|2018]]''': 20 years after Dale Earnhardt's 1998 victory, [[Austin Dillon]] took the No. 3 back to victory lane with a last lap pass.\n*'''[[2020 Daytona 500|2020]]''': The race was abandoned after 20 laps due to persistent rain and delayed until Monday. A Big One on the backstretch with less than twenty laps to go eliminated Jimmie Johnson's chances of a third and final Daytona 500 victory in his swansong season. Another crash in turn 2 with three laps to go set up an overtime finish. [[Denny Hamlin]] defended his Daytona 500 win from the previous year and became the first driver to win back to back Daytona 500s since [[Sterling Marlin]] in 1994-1995, however his win was overshadowed by a crash coming to the flag that seriously<ref>https://twitter.com/roushfenway/status/1229602655883886592?s=20</ref> injured [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Daytona 500}}\n\n[[Category:History of Florida]]\n[[Category:History of NASCAR]]\n[[Category:NASCAR races at Daytona International Speedway]]\n", "text_old": "This article documents historical records, statistics, and race recaps of the [[Daytona 500]], held annually at [[Daytona International Speedway]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]].\n\n==Pre-race history==\n\nThe table below summarizes the [[Safety car|pace cars]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Daytona 500 History Pace Cars |publisher=[[Daytona International Speedway]] |url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/News/DAYTONA-500-History/All-time-Pace-Cars.aspx |accessdate=2010-02-15 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227022821/http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/News/DAYTONA-500-History/All-time-Pace-Cars.aspx |archivedate=2010-12-27 |df= }}</ref> [[Grand Marshal]]s,<ref>{{cite web|title=Daytona 500 History Grand Marshals |publisher=[[Daytona International Speedway]] |url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/News/DAYTONA-500-History/Grand-Marshals.aspx |accessdate=2010-02-15 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227022915/http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/News/DAYTONA-500-History/Grand-Marshals.aspx |archivedate=2010-12-27 |df= }}</ref> [[Racing flags|Honorary Starters]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Daytona 500 History Honorary Starters |publisher=[[Daytona International Speedway]] |url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/News/DAYTONA-500-History/Honorary-Starters.aspx |accessdate=2010-02-15 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227021702/http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/News/DAYTONA-500-History/Honorary-Starters.aspx |archivedate=2010-12-27 |df= }}</ref> and performers of the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Daytona 500 History National Anthem Vocalists |publisher=[[Daytona International Speedway]] |url=http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/News/DAYTONA-500-History/National-Anthem-Vocalists.aspx |accessdate=2010-02-15 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227023301/http://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/News/DAYTONA-500-History/National-Anthem-Vocalists.aspx |archivedate=2010-12-27 |df= }}</ref> at the [[Daytona 500]].

Petty and Beauchamp were lapping [[Joe Weatherly]] at the finish.  Petty, Beauchamp, and Weatherly crossed the finish line three abreast with Weatherly on the outside, Beauchamp on the inside, and Petty in the middle. A [[photo finish]] in a race of that duration and speed seemed inconceivable and photo-finish cameras were not installed at the track. NASCAR initially declared Beauchamp the winner.  After reviewing photographs and newsreels of the finish for three days, the call was reversed, and Petty was awarded the win.  Petty received $19,050 for winning.  Ken Marriott was scored as the last place driver having completed one lap and won $100.<ref>{{Cite news|title=No. 5 most memorable Daytona 500: The photo finish|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/columns/story?id=2762491|date=February 15, 2007|first=Terry|last=Blount|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.|ESPN]]|accessdate=March 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.racing-reference.info/race?id=1959-03&series=W \"1959 Daytona 500\"]. Racing-Reference.info Retrieved 2009-09-16.</ref>\n\nIn 1960, [[Junior Johnson|Robert \"Junior\" Johnson]] won, despite running a slower, year-old car in a field of 68 cars, most in Daytona 500 history through the present day. Johnson made use of the [[drafting (aerodynamics)|draft]], then a little-understood phenomenon, to keep up with the leaders.\n\nAfter three years of being the best driver never to win the Daytona 500, [[Fireball Roberts|Glenn \"Fireball\" Roberts]] came to the 1962 edition race of the Daytona 500 on a hot roll, he won the American Challenge for winners of 1961 NASCAR events, the pole position for the Daytona 500, and the Twin-100-mile qualifier. He dominated the race, leading 144 of the 200 laps and finally won his first (and ultimately only) Daytona 500.\n\nIn 1963, it was [[Tiny Lund|DeWayne \"Tiny\" Lund]] who took the victory for the Wood Brothers, however the real drama began a couple weeks before the race when Lund helped pull 1961 winner [[Marvin Panch]] from a burning sportscar at a considerable risk to himself. As a result of his heroism, the Wood Brothers asked Lund to replace Panch in the Daytona 500 and Lund took the car to the winner's circle.\n\nDriving a potent [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] with the new [[Hemi]] engine, [[Richard Petty]] led 184 of the 200 laps to win the 1964 Daytona 500 going away. Plymouths ran 1-2-3 at the finish. The triumph was Petty's first on a super-speedway.\n\nThe first rain-shortened Daytona 500 was the 1965 event. Leader Marvin Panch and [[Fred Lorenzen]] made contact on Lap 129, as rain began to fall; Panch spun out, and Lorenzen won when the race was finally called on Lap 133. The 1966 Daytona 500, won by [[Richard Petty]], was also shortened, to 198 laps, due to rain.<ref>Bob Zeller, ''Daytona 500: An Official History'' (Phoenix: David Bull Publishing, 2002): 48-52.</ref>\n\n1967 saw [[Mario Andretti]] dominate the race. He led 112 of the 200 laps including the last 33 laps to capture his only win in the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]].\n\nThe 1968 race saw a duel involving [[Cale Yarborough]] and [[LeeRoy Yarbrough]]. For much of the day, both drivers traded the lead. With 5 laps to go, Yarborough made a successful slingshot pass on the third turn to take the lead from Yarbrough and never looked back as he won his first Daytona 500 by 1.3 seconds. LeeRoy Yarbrough would inflict the same treatment on [[Charlie Glotzbach]] the next year, winning the 1969 Daytona 500 on the last lap.\n\n===1970\u20131979===\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2010}}\nThe 1970s opened with [[Cale Yarborough]] qualifying at pole with a {{convert|194.015|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} run. Fate played a major role in the 1970 race, claiming one driver after another as soon as the green flag fell. Richard Petty, then Yarborough who dropped out after leading 26 of the first 31 laps, Donnie Allison, and [[A. J. Foyt]] also dropped out of the race. Later in the race, [[Pete Hamilton]], an unknown driver prior to this race, was contested the lead with the likes of [[Charlie Glotzbach]] and [[David Pearson (NASCAR driver)|David Pearson]]. On lap 192, Hamilton passed Pearson for the lead, and although Pearson tried valiantly to regain the lead, it was Hamilton who took the checkered flag in front of the largest crowd to ever have seen the Daytona 500 (an estimated 103,800). It was the first of 4 victories Hamilton would have in his brief NASCAR career.\n\nThe 1972 race was called a One-Sided Daytona 500. A. J. Foyt cruised [[lanyard]] into the lead with about 300 miles to go and captured the victory. It was Foyt's sixth career Winston Cup Grand National victory, and it gave the famed Wood Brothers of Stuart, VA, their third Daytona 500 triumph. They had previously won with Tiny Lund in 1963 and Cale Yarborough in 1968. In the event punctuated by a weak field because of factory withdrawal, Foyt outlasted four rivals and beat runner-up Charlie Glotzbach by nearly two laps. Jim Vandiver was six laps down and finished third; Benny Parsons was fourth and James Hylton fifth. Only three caution flags for 17 laps interrupted Foyt's pace. He averaged 161.550&nbsp;mph\u2014an all-time record for the Daytona 500.\n\nDuring the start of the 1974 NASCAR season, many races had their distance cut ten percent in response to the [[1973 oil crisis]]. As a result, the 1974 Daytona 500, won by [[Richard Petty]] (his second straight, making him the first driver ever to do it), was shortened to 180 laps (450 miles), as symbolically, the race \"started\" on Lap 21. The Twin 125 qualifying races were also shortened to 45 laps (112.5 miles).<ref>Zeller, 84-87.</ref> Richard Petty overcame tough luck of his own and capitalized on the misfortunes of Donnie Allison to win his fifth Daytona 500. The 47-second triumph was petty's 155th in Winston Cup Grand National competition. A record 53 laps were run under the caution flag, which reduced Petty's average winning speed to 140.894&nbsp;mph.\n\nIn 1975, it appeared David Pearson was on his way to his first Daytona 500 victory as he built a sizable lead on second place [[Benny Parsons]] late in the race.  However, Richard Petty, who was several laps behind the leaders, and Parsons hooked up in a draft and began reeling in Pearson who was slowed by lapped traffic.  The key moment of the race occurred two laps from the end when contact with a backmarker sent Pearson spinning on the backstretch.  Parsons avoided the accident and went on to take the win.\n\nIn the 1976 500, [[Richard Petty]] was leading on the last lap when he was passed on the backstretch by David Pearson. Petty tried to turn under Pearson coming off the final corner, but didn't clear Pearson. The contact caused the drivers to spin into the grass in the infield just short of the finish line. Petty's car didn't start, but Pearson was able to keep his car running and limp over the finish line for the win. Many fans consider this finish to be the greatest in the history of NASCAR.\n\nFor Bobby Allison, the Daytona 500 prior to the 1978 race was not kind to him, in fact he came to the race with a 67-race winless streak but with 11 laps remaining, he pushed his [[Bud Moore Engineering|Bud Moore]] [[Ford]] around [[Buddy Baker]] to take the lead and never look back as he captured his first Daytona 500 win.\n\nThe [[1979 Daytona 500]] was the first {{convert|500|mi|km|adj=on}} race to be broadcast live on national television, airing on [[CBS Sports|CBS]], whose audience was increased in much of the Eastern and Midwestern USA due to a blizzard. (The [[Indianapolis 500]] was only broadcast on tape delay that evening in this era; most races were broadcast only through the final quarter to half of the race, as was the procedure for ABC's Championship Auto Racing broadcasts; with the new CBS contract, the network and NASCAR agreed to a full live broadcast.) That telecast introduced in-car and low-level track-side cameras, which has now become standard in all sorts of automotive racing broadcasts. A final lap crash and subsequent fight between leaders [[Cale Yarborough]] and [[Donnie Allison]] (along with Donnie's brother [[Bobby Allison]]) brought national (if unwelcome) publicity to NASCAR, with the added emphasis of a snowstorm that bogged down much of the northeastern part of the United States. Donnie Allison was leading the race on the final lap with Yarborough drafting him tightly. As Yarborough attempted a slingshot pass at the end of the backstretch, Allison attempted to block him. Yarborough refused to give ground and as he pulled alongside Allison, his left side tires left the pavement and went into the wet and muddy infield grass. Yarborough lost control of his car and contacted Allison's car halfway down the backstretch. As both drivers tried to regain control, their cars made contact several more times before finally locking together and crashing into the outside wall in turn three. After the cars settled in the grass, Donnie Allison and Yarborough began to argue. After they had talked it out, Bobby Allison, who was lapped at that point, pulled over, began defending his brother, and a fight broke out. Richard Petty, who was over half a lap behind at the time, went on to win; with the brawl in the infield, the television audience scarcely noticed. The story was the talk of the water cooler the next day, even making the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' Sports section. NASCAR, as a national sport, had finally arrived after years of moonshine runners.\n\n===1980\u20131989===\n*'''[[1980 Daytona 500|1980]]''': [[Buddy Baker]] won the fastest Daytona 500 in history, at 177.602&nbsp;mph (285.809&nbsp;km/h).\n*'''[[1981 Daytona 500|1981]]''': With 24 laps to go, [[Richard Petty]] came to the pits for his final scheduled pit stop. Instead of changing tires, the team gambled and only took on fuel. Petty shocked the other drivers as he returned to the track in the lead. Petty became the first driver to win the Daytona 500 in three different decades.\n*'''[[1982 Daytona 500|1982]]''': In the early laps of the 1982 race, Bobby Allison's bumper flew off, allowing his No. 88 Buick Regal to go faster, in an incident known as \"Bumpergate\". Allison won the 1982 Daytona 500 in spite of this. It was also the first Daytona 500 chosen to be the first race of the NASCAR season.\n*'''[[1983 Daytona 500|1983]]''': [[Cale Yarborough]] was the first driver to run a qualifying lap over 200&nbsp;mph (320&nbsp;km/h) at Daytona in his No. 28 [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]. However, on his second of two qualifying laps, Yarborough crashed and flipped his car in turn four. The car had to be withdrawn, and the lap did not count. Despite the crash, Yarborough drove a back-up car (a [[Pontiac LeMans]]) to victory, taking the lead from Buddy Baker on the last lap with a duplicate of the pass he attempted on Donnie Allison in 1979.\n*'''[[1984 Daytona 500|1984]]''': [[Cale Yarborough]] completed a lap of 201.848&nbsp;mph (324.828&nbsp;km/h), officially breaking the {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} barrier at Daytona. He won the race for the second year in a row, and fourth time in his career, with the identical last-lap pass, this time outpacing [[Darrell Waltrip]].\n*'''[[1985 Daytona 500|1985]]''': [[Bill Elliott]] dominated the race, and by lap 140, was close to lapping the entire field except for second place. During a pit stop, NASCAR officials held him in the pit area in order to repair a supposed broken headlight assembly. The two-minute pit stop dropped him to third, barely clinging to the lead lap. Elliott made up the deficit mostly under green. Elliott survived a late race caution and a final lap restart to win his first Daytona 500. Elliott would go on to win the first [[Winston Million]].\n*'''[[1986 Daytona 500|1986]]''': The race that came down to the final 70 laps (all run under green); a two-car race involving [[Dale Earnhardt]] and [[Geoff Bodine]]. Earnhardt led for 10 laps while Bodine led for 60. With 3 laps to go, Earnhardt was forced to make a pit stop for a \"splash 'n go\". However, as Earnhardt left the pits he burned a piston, allowing Bodine to cruise to victory by 11.26 seconds.\n*'''[[1987 Daytona 500|1987]]''': [[Bill Elliott]] qualified for the pole position at an all-time Daytona record of 210.364&nbsp;mph (338.532&nbsp;km/h). He had already won convincingly in the 1985 race, and won his second Daytona 500 in 1987 in similarly dominating fashion.\n*'''[[1988 Daytona 500|1988]]''': [[Restrictor plate]]s were mandated to reduce dangerously high speeds at Daytona and its sister track, [[Talladega Speedway]].  The race began despite uncertainty about how well these would work.  Eventually, [[Bobby Allison]] and his son [[Davey Allison]] finished one-two and celebrated together in Victory Lane. Bobby Allison thus became the oldest driver to win the Daytona 500.  The race is also remembered for [[Richard Petty]]'s wild accident on lap 106. Petty spun, became airborne and tumbled along a large section of [[catch fence]] before his car came to a stop. The car was then torn nearly in half from hits by [[A. J. Foyt]] and [[Brett Bodine]].  Petty escaped without serious injury.  Restrictor plates remain in use at Daytona and Talladega to this day despite a disposition to create [[Oval track racing#Pack racing|pack racing]] and a phenomenon known as [[The Big One (NASCAR)|The Big One]].\n*'''[[1989 Daytona 500|1989]]''': [[Darrell Waltrip]] finally won the Daytona 500 after 17 attempts. (Coincidentally, the car he drove to victory, the [[Tide Ride]], wore number 17.) Waltrip amazingly stretched his fuel for the last 53 laps, meanwhile, most of his competitors were forced to pit. Waltrip ran out of gas as he pulled into Victory Lane. Fans loudly cheered the childlike exuberance of Waltrip's victory celebration. As he was being interviewed by CBS pit reporter [[Mike Joy]], Waltrip shouted, \"I won the Daytona 500! I won the Daytona 500!\" Shortly after, an exuberant Waltrip performed an \"[[Ickey Shuffle]]\" dance in Victory Lane, and ruined his helmet spiking it to the ground.\n\n===1990\u20131999===\n*'''[[1990 Daytona 500|1990]]''': After several years of futility, [[Dale Earnhardt]] appeared headed for certain victory until a series of events in the closing laps. On lap 193 [[Geoff Bodine]] spun in the first turn, causing the third and final caution of the race. All of the leaders pitted except [[Derrike Cope]], who stayed out to gain track position. On the lap 195 restart, Earnhardt re-took the lead. On the final lap, going into turn three, Earnhardt ran over a [[bell housing]] from the blown engine of [[Rick Wilson (NASCAR)|Rick Wilson]]'s car. He blew a tire, slowed suddenly, and veered out of the groove, allowing the relatively unknown [[Derrike Cope|Cope]] to slip by and take his first career win in a major upset.<ref>{{cite web | title = NASCAR.com&nbsp;\u2013 The 1990 Daytona 500 - July 28, 2003 | url = http://www.nascar.com/2002/kyn/history/races/02/02/90daytona500/ | accessdate = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008 | url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070817224950/http://www.nascar.com/2002/kyn/history/races/02/02/90daytona500/ | archivedate = August 17, 2007 | df =  }}</ref>\n*'''[[1991 Daytona 500|1991]]''': [[Dale Earnhardt]]'s Daytona 500 frustrations continued as [[Ernie Irvan]] passed Earnhardt with six laps to go to. Earnhardt's day started out on a sour note, as he hit a [[seagull]] in the opening laps. The damage inflicted by the bird affected the aerodynamics, and damaged the radiator, causing high water temperatures. Ultimately, Earnhardt spun out with two laps remaining and collected [[Davey Allison]] and [[Kyle Petty]]. Irvan coasted on fumes on the final lap as the race ended under the caution flag. The race was dominated by complex pit stop rules, implemented to improve safety in the pit area.\n*'''[[1992 Daytona 500|1992]]''': [[Davey Allison]] dominated the second half en route to his lone Daytona 500 victory. He avoided the \"Big One\" on lap 92 and went on to lead the final 102 laps. To date, Allison is the last driver to win the Daytona 500 after leading the halfway lap.\n*'''[[1993 Daytona 500|1993]]''': Rookie [[Jeff Gordon]] made a splash, winning one of the Budweiser Duels, and leading the opening lap of the race. He would finish in the top five. On lap 170, a frightening wreck occurred that saw [[Rusty Wallace]] flip over multiple times on the back straightaway. With two laps to go, [[Dale Earnhardt]] was leading Gordon and [[Dale Jarrett]]. Using a push from fourth place [[Geoff Bodine]], Jarrett battled into the lead with one lap to go. In the broadcast booth, his father and former Cup champion [[Ned Jarrett]] became his son's biggest fan on national TV. It was the fourth time Earnhardt had been leading the Daytona 500 with less than ten laps to go, but failed to win.\n*'''[[1994 Daytona 500|1994]]''': After the deaths of [[Davey Allison]] and [[Alan Kulwicki]], the Cup circuit experienced several team/driver changes for 1994. In the offseason, [[Sterling Marlin]] landed in [[Ernie Irvan]]'s former ride at [[Morgan-McClure Motorsports]].  Between father ([[Coo Coo Marlin|Coo Coo]]) and son (Sterling), the Marlin family was 0-for-443 in Winston Cup starts. Marlin gambled on fuel, and was able to complete the final 59 laps on his tank of fuel to win his first career Cup victory. The win, however, was overshadowed by tragedy earlier in Speedweeks, as [[Neil Bonnett]] and [[Rodney Orr]] were killed in practice crashes.\n*'''[[1995 Daytona 500|1995]]''': [[Sterling Marlin]] became the first driver since [[Cale Yarborough]], and only third overall, to win back-to-back Daytona 500s. During a late caution, Marlin stayed out in the lead, while many of the leaders pitted for new tires. [[Dale Earnhardt]] dramatically charged from 14th to 2nd, but Marlin managed to hold him off on the final lap, despite running on old tires. To date, Marlin is the last driver to have won back-to-back Daytona 500s.\n*'''[[1996 Daytona 500|1996]]''': [[Dale Jarrett]] won his second Daytona 500 in four years, again holding off [[Dale Earnhardt]], who finished second for the third time in four years.\n*'''[[1997 Daytona 500|1997]]''': [[Jeff Gordon]] became the youngest driver to win the Daytona 500. Gordon and his [[Hendrick Motorsports]] teammates [[Terry Labonte]] and [[Ricky Craven]] ganged up on race leader [[Bill Elliott]] during the final ten laps. The race ended under the caution flag, as the teammates grabbed a 1-2-3 finish.\n*'''[[1998 Daytona 500|1998]]''': [[Dale Earnhardt]] finally won the Daytona 500 after 20 years of trying. Though Earnhardt had usually been a strong competitor in the Daytona 500, mechanical problems, crashes or bad luck had prevented him from winning the race. In 1998, however, Earnhardt was leading when [[Lake Speed]] and [[John Andretti]] made contact on Lap 198, causing the race to end under caution. After his victory, a joyous Earnhardt drove slowly down pit road, where members of other race teams had lined up to give him handshakes and high-fives. The victory was widely celebrated, even by people who weren't his fans, and was a defining moment in Earnhardt's career and legacy.<ref>{{cite web |title=NASCAR.com - 1998: A deserving win for Dale&nbsp;\u2013 March 19, 2003 |url=http://www.nascar.com/2003/kyn/history/daytona/02/11/daytona_1998/index.html |accessdate=2008-02-20 |year=2008 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013083928/http://www.nascar.com/2003/kyn/history/daytona/02/11/daytona_1998/index.html |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }}</ref> [[Mike Joy]], who was play-by-play announcer for [[NASCAR on CBS|CBS]]'s broadcast in 1998 (his first play-by-play call of the Daytona 500) called the win \"the most anticipated moment in racing\".\n*'''[[1999 Daytona 500|1999]]''': [[Jeff Gordon]] grabbed his second Daytona 500 win using drafting help from [[Dale Earnhardt]] to pull off a daring three-wide pass on [[Rusty Wallace]] and [[Mike Skinner (NASCAR)|Mike Skinner]] with 10 laps remaining.  Gordon then managed to hold off a determined Earnhardt to earn the victory.

Polesitter [[Dale Jarrett]], however, made the winning pass on a restart with only four laps remaining. Jarrett led a pack of three Ford drivers to gang up and nudge Benson in turn 2, then draft past him on the backstretch. It was Jarrett's third Daytona 500 victory. The race was widely criticized by media and fans for being uncompetitive due to a restrictive aerodynamic rules package. [[Dale Earnhardt]] later complained to the media, \"[The rules] took NASCAR Winston Cup racing and made it some of the sorriest racing. They took racing out of the hands of the drivers and the crews. We can't adjust and make our cars drive like we want. They just killed the racing at Daytona.

This was the second [[restrictor plate]] race run under a rules package that was intended to increase competition after the lackluster 2000 event and complaints from drivers like Earnhardt.<ref>{{cite web | title = Jayski's Silly Season Site&nbsp;\u2013 Restrictor Plate Chart | url = http://www.jayski.com/stats/restrictor.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150505165343/http://www.jayski.com/stats/restrictor.htm | archive-date = 2015-05-05 | url-status = dead}}</ref> Though it was meant to give power back to the drivers and help produce more lead changes, critics ultimately charged that it created dangerously close racing conditions, as cars raced three wide for long stretches. However, the race was also one of the cleanest, as there were only three caution flags (one of which temporarily was a red flag) in the entire race. A crash on the back straightaway on lap 173 eliminated eighteen cars in spectacular fashion and resulted in the race being red-flagged temporarily for cleanup. [[Tony Stewart]] took the worst ride, as his car went over [[Robby Gordon]] and flipped end-over-end before coming to a rest in the infield. [[Kurt Busch]] made his Daytona 500 debut driving in the No. 97 Roush Ford. [[Michael Waltrip]], making his first start for [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.|DEI]] was leading the race on the final lap, with teammate [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] second. Team owner Dale Earnhardt (driving his familiar [[Richard Childress Racing|RCR]] entry) was running third, blocking for his two drivers. In turn 4, Earnhardt lost control after contact from [[Sterling Marlin]], and crashed into the outside wall, taking [[Ken Schrader]] with him. Earnhardt suffered a fatal [[basilar skull fracture]], at the same time his team cars were crossing the finish line 1st-2nd.<ref>{{cite web | title = Jayski's Silly Season Site&nbsp;\u2013 Race Info Page | url = http://www.jayski.com/next/2001/2001daytona500.htm | accessdate = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929095714/http://www.jayski.com/next/2001/2001daytona500.htm | archive-date = 2007-09-29 | url-status = dead}}</ref> The tragedy ushered in a new era of safety in NASCAR. The 2001 race also marked the beginning of NASCAR's new television contract with [[Fox NASCAR|Fox]].\n*'''[[2002 Daytona 500|2002]]''': [[Sterling Marlin]] was battling [[Jeff Gordon]] for the lead when they made contact, sending Gordon's car spinning, and triggering a multi-car crash. NASCAR red-flagged the race so it would not finish under caution, and stopped the field momentarily on the backstretch. Concerned about a damaged right front fender, Marlin jumped out of his car and started pulling the fender away from the tire. As working on the car is prohibited during red flag conditions, Marlin was penalized, and sent to the tail end of the field for the restart. [[Ward Burton]] survived the wacky last ten laps, and posted the biggest victory of his career.\n*'''[[2003 Daytona 500|2003]]''': [[Michael Waltrip]] became a two-time winner after the race was shortened to 109 laps due to rain.<ref>{{cite web | title = 2003 Daytona 500 - Racing-Reference.info | url = http://racing-reference.info/race?id=2003-01&series=W | accessdate = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070309044703/http://www.racing-reference.info/race?id=2003-01&series=W | archive-date = 2007-03-09 | url-status = dead}}</ref> It was the shortest ever recorded Daytona 500.\n*'''[[2004 Daytona 500|2004]]''': [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] and [[Tony Stewart]] dominated the race, combining to lead 156 of 200 laps. With twenty laps to go, Earnhardt, Jr. got past Stewart in turn 3 without drafting help, and won the race exactly six years to the date after his father's celebrated win.\n[[File:NASCAR practice.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Practice for the 2004 Daytona 500.]]\n*'''[[2005 Daytona 500|2005]]''': The start time was changed, allowing the race to finish under the lights at dusk. [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] made a popular charge to the front on lap 197, but made his move too soon, and [[Jeff Gordon]] slipped by to re-take the lead. In the first use of the [[green-white-checker finish]] rule in the Daytona 500, Gordon held off Earnhardt, Jr. to win his third Daytona 500.\n*'''[[2006 Daytona 500|2006]]''': During post-qualifying inspection, [[Chad Knaus]] was ejected for an illegal rear window on the [[Hendrick Motorsports]] No. 48 car.  During the race, [[Tony Stewart]] aggressively blocked [[Matt Kenseth]] going into turn 3 on lap 106, sending Kenseth into a dangerous spin in front of the entire field. Misty rain and drizzle lasted most of the race, but did not affect the green flag conditions. The No. 48 team, with [[Jimmie Johnson]] driving and [[Darian Grubb]] as crew chief for the first of four races following Knaus' ejection and subsequent suspension, won after a green-white-checkered finish.\n*'''[[2007 Daytona 500|2007]]''': Nearing the end, [[Mark Martin]] was leading, looking for his first Daytona victory. A wreck in the final five laps that ended Dale Earnhardt, Jr.'s run brought out the yellow, and set up a green-white-checker finish, [[Kevin Harvick]] drove from 5th to 2nd in the final two turns. As Harvick approached Martin exiting turn 4, a huge wreck erupted behind them. Martin and Harvick drag-raced to the checkered flag with Harvick claiming victory by 0.02 seconds, the 4th closest finish in NASCAR history. Most of the rest of the field crashed across the finish line. Some controversy surrounded the finish since no caution flag was thrown, and there is disputed visual evidence that suggests that Martin would have been declared winner if the caution flag had come out.\n[[File:Daytona 2008 Earnhardt.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Start of the [[2008 Daytona 500]]. The inside cars are [[Jimmie Johnson]] (No. 48), [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] (No. 88), and [[Reed Sorenson]] (No. 41). The outside cars are [[Michael Waltrip]] (No. 55) and [[Denny Hamlin]] (No. 11).]]\n*'''[[2008 Daytona 500|2008]]''': The celebrated 50th running of the Daytona 500 was the first using NASCAR's [[Car of Tomorrow]]. It also marked the first race under the \"Sprint Cup Series\" banner, following the merger of [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] with [[Nextel Communications|Nextel]] in 2006. The first 150 laps were mostly caution free, with only two yellow flags thrown for debris. But the final 20 laps saw three crashes. On the final restart on lap 197, [[Tony Stewart]] stormed past [[Jeff Burton]] into the lead. On the final lap down the back straightaway, Stewart dove to the bottom to pick up drafting help from his teammate Kyle Busch. This move proved to be disastrous as it opened the door for [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]], who surged to the front and took the checkered flag.\n*'''[[2009 Daytona 500|2009]]''': The race was called on account of rain with 48 laps remaining. The leader at the time of the red flag, [[Matt Kenseth]], was declared the winner, his first Daytona 500 win in ten attempts and the first win for [[Roush Fenway Racing|Roush]]. Kenseth led only one lap under green.\n\n===2010\u2013present===\n*'''[[2010 Daytona 500|2010]]''': After six consecutive years of moving the start time further from 1&nbsp;pm to 3:30&nbsp;pm by 2009 to reach a prime-time finish, NASCAR and Fox agreed to return the race to a 1&nbsp;pm ET start as part of a uniform agreement on start times of 1&nbsp;pm, 3 PM, or 7:30&nbsp;pm for the majority of NASCAR Cup Series races during the season, ending what had become a nearly-standard 2&nbsp;pm ET start time for Eastern and Central time zone races during the season.  An aging asphalt surface, coupled with cool weather and heavy precipitation leading up the race, saw a huge, dangerous, pothole develop on the track in turn 2. Two red flag periods totaling nearly 2 and a half hours delayed the proceedings, as track crew attempted to fix the damage. Officials eventually filled the hole with Bondo, and the race resumed, finishing in prime-time. During the second green-white-checker attempt, [[Jamie McMurray]] passed [[Greg Biffle]] and [[Kevin Harvick]] on the 207th lap, holding off [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] to win.\n*'''[[2011 Daytona 500|2011]]''': After the embarrassing pothole incident of 2010, the [[Daytona International Speedway]] was completely repaved for the 2011 season, the first time since 1978. Since this race marked the tenth anniversary of the death of Dale Earnhardt, the third lap of the race was a \"silent lap\" (previously used in Earnhardt's memory during the 2001 season, meaning the TV and radio announcers were silent during the entire lap, and fans held up three fingers in reference to Earnhardt's car number). Fittingly, [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] won the pole position, but started last because of a crash during Wednesday practice before the qualifying races. The larger controversy was the two-car tandem racing, which had been proven at Talladega Superspeedway in 2009 on occasion, and the two-car tandem had been much faster than the more traditional multiple-car packs, forcing NASCAR to adopt pressure relief valves in an attempt to force the cars to overheat, forcing the cars to split from the two-car tandems after a short time.  On lap 131, [[Matt Kenseth]] demonstrated the quality of the new safety devices when he was turned into the wall from a push by [[Greg Biffle]] as hard if not harder than Dale Earnhardt did 10 years previous, and getting out of his car on his own power immediately after. 20-year-old [[Trevor Bayne]], in his first Daytona 500 start and only running a partial Cup schedule in 2011, and making just his second career NASCAR Cup Series start, held off [[Carl Edwards]], [[David Gilliland]] and [[Bobby Labonte]] to win the race and become the youngest Daytona 500 winner, and second-youngest to win a Cup race (the youngest being [[Joey Logano]], who won a rain-shortened New Hampshire event at nineteen years, one month and four days old). The win also tied the record for fewest starts by a driver before winning his first Cup race (two starts, held by [[Jamie McMurray]], who oddly also pulled the trick in his pre-rookie season, but as a substitute for an injured Sterling Marlin)\n*'''[[2012 Daytona 500|2012]]''': As a result of the NFL moving the Super Bowl into the first Sunday of February permanently in 2004, and eventually the 2010 race having a condensed first weekend (practice, qualifying, and the ARCA and special race being moved to Saturday in order to make Super Bowl day an off-day), NASCAR decided to move the Daytona 500 back to the Sunday of or after Washington's Birthday (February 22, but not the federally observed day), which February 26 in 2012.  Rain, however delayed the race a day (forcing the originally-planned honorary starter [[John Cena]] to leave for Portland for a [[WWE]] commitment), originally planning to reschedule the race for Monday afternoon at 12 noon EST.   With radar being inconsistent, and the introduction of the new vacuum-based Air Titan system being discussed, Fox and NASCAR agreed to scrub the noon start in favour of a 7&nbsp;pm start that Monday night, resulting in the first primetime Daytona 500 start (but the third Daytona 500 to reach primetime). The race is best remembered for the incident on lap 160, when [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] crashed into a jet dryer in turn 3 under caution, sparking a lengthy red flag as crews put out the resulting fire and repaired the damage. The race, scheduled to begin at 1&nbsp;pm EST on Sunday afternoon, ended at approximately 1&nbsp;am EST Tuesday morning, leading the event to possibly be known as the \"36 hours of Daytona\". [[Matt Kenseth]] held off [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] and [[Greg Biffle]] over the last 40 laps to win his second Daytona 500 and first Daytona 500 to go the distance. Kenseth was the first repeat winner in the Daytona 500 since [[Michael Waltrip]]'s rain-shortened 2003 race. Besides Montoya's accident with the jet dryer, there were three large crashes in the race itself: one on lap 2 involving five cars, one on lap 188 involving seven cars, and one on lap 196 involving eight cars.  It was the first time the Daytona 500 reached last night television.\n*'''[[2013 Daytona 500|2013]]''': This was the first race with NASCAR's new redesigned Generation 6 body. The big highlight was that rookie [[Danica Patrick]] won the pole, the first woman to win a pole in a NASCAR Cup Series race or the Daytona 500. She also was the first woman to lead laps under green flag conditions in the race. [[Matt Kenseth]], now driving for [[Joe Gibbs Racing]], dominated the first 3/4ths of the race before he and [[Kyle Busch]] ended their days with engine failures. Two crashes in turn 1 eliminated a number of cars from contention. In the final laps, [[Jimmie Johnson]] and [[Brad Keselowski]] were battling for the lead. On the last restart, Johnson pulled away, holding off [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] and [[Mark Martin]] to win his second Daytona 500. This marked the first time Johnson had finished better than 27th in this race since winning in 2006, and first win in the 500 for the 2014 Chevrolet SS, which was a [[captive import]] and rebrand of Australian manufacturer [[Holden]]'s [[Holden VF Commodore|new VF Commodore]]. It was also Johnson's 400th career start.\n*'''[[2014 Daytona 500|2014]]''': For the second year in a row, a rookie won the pole position for the Daytona 500, in this case [[Austin Dillon]] in his first ride in the newly renumbered No. 3 Chevrolet SS for [[Richard Childress Racing]], the first time the No. 3 had been used in a NASCAR Cup Series race since [[Dale Earnhardt]]'s death (the car had been No. 29 with its previous driver, [[Kevin Harvick]], who moved to [[Stewart-Haas Racing]] for 2014). The race is also nicknamed the Ten Hours of Daytona, as the green flag was dropped at 1:30&nbsp;pm and the cars took the checkered flag just after 11:30&nbsp;pm EST, due to a lengthy 6-hour 22-minute delay just 39 laps into the race for thunderstorms and a tornado warning in the area.  Dillon started off leading the first lap, but faded back afterwards. [[Denny Hamlin]], [[Kurt Busch]], [[Kyle Busch]] and [[Paul Menard]] were the strongest cars during the first 40 laps. [[Martin Truex, Jr.]], who had switched to a backup car after a last-lap crash during his Duel, was the first driver out, blowing an engine five laps before the red flag. When the race restarted around 8:45&nbsp;pm EST, the race saw much more intense competition due to cooler track temperatures and increased tire grip. Although the threat of rain became persistent after lap 150, the storm bands stalled long enough to allow the race to run the full distance. In the last sixty laps, the lead changed hands primarily between [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] and the Roush Fenway Fords of [[Carl Edwards]] and [[Greg Biffle]]. A five-car crash at the back of the field with seven laps to go set the field up for a two lap shootout on the final restart. Earnhardt, Jr. held off [[Denny Hamlin]], [[Jeff Gordon]] and [[Brad Keselowski]] over the last two laps, ending when a six-car crash in Turn 4 resulted in a yellow chequer finish, giving Earnhardt his second Daytona 500, exactly ten years and one week after he won [[2004 Daytona 500|his first 500]]. This was the third straight Daytona 500 to be won by a past winner of the race, after Kenseth in 2012 and Johnson in 2013, and the third Daytona 500 won by a car with the number No. 88 (as [[Dale Jarrett]] won the 1996 and 2000 races with the No. 88 for Yates Racing). Thanks to the introduction of a slightly taller rear spoiler to increase drag and downforce in the cars following criticism of a lack of green-flag passing in the previous year's 500, there were 19 leaders and 43 lead changes overall during the race.\n* '''[[2015 Daytona 500|2015]]''': The race had seven caution flags and was extended to 203 laps and {{convert|507.5|miles|km}} due to a [[green-white-checkered finish]]. [[Joey Logano]] won the race, giving [[Team Penske]] a second Daytona 500 victory. [[Kevin Harvick]] finished second; [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] finished third; [[Denny Hamlin]] finished fourth, and [[Jimmie Johnson]] finished fifth, [[Casey Mears]] finished sixth, [[Clint Bowyer]] finished seventh; [[Martin Truex, Jr.]] finished eighth; [[Kasey Kahne]] finished ninth, and [[Greg Biffle]] finished 10th. [[Jeff Gordon]], running his final full Cup season, won his second pole for the Daytona 500 (his first since the [[1999 Daytona 500|1999]] race) and he also led the most laps with 87; he finished 33rd after being caught up in a last-lap accident.  Neither Busch brother competed in this race, as Kurt was suspended for domestic issues and Kyle was injured in a crash during the previous day's Xfinity Series opener.\n*'''[[2016 Daytona 500|2016]]''': Rookie [[Chase Elliott]] started the race from the pole position, in the first race now-Fox commentator Jeff Gordon wasn't driving the Hendrick Motorsports No. 24. Driver [[Denny Hamlin]] led 95 laps during the race and passed leader [[Matt Kenseth]] on the last lap. Hamlin would then beat [[Martin Truex Jr.]] by 0.010 seconds, which would become the closest finish in the Daytona 500.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cain|first1=Holly|title=DENNY HAMLIN WINS THRILLING DAYTONA 500|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2016/2/21/daytona-500-denny-hamlin-race-recap-sprint-cup-series.html|website=nascar.com|publisher=nascar.com|date=21 February 2016|accessdate=23 February 2016}}</ref>  Hamlin's victory is the first Daytona 500 victory by a Toyota, in the first points-paying race after teammate Kyle Busch used an injury waiver to become the first Cup champion to win driving a Toyota.

The Big One happened shortly before the end of the second stage, eliminating both Kyle Busch and Dale Earnhardt, Jr., the latter in his final Daytona 500, among others.\n*'''[[2018 Daytona 500|2018]]''': 20 years after Dale Earnhardt's 1998 victory, [[Austin Dillon]] took the No. 3 back to victory lane with a last lap pass.\n*'''[[2020 Daytona 500|2020]]''': The race was abandoned after 20 laps due to persistent rain and delayed until Monday. A Big One on the backstretch with less than twenty laps to go eliminated Jimmie Johnson's chances of a third and final Daytona 500 victory in his swansong season. Another crash in turn 2 with three laps to go set up an overtime finish. [[Denny Hamlin]] defended his Daytona 500 win from the previous year and became the first driver to win back to back Daytona 500s since [[Sterling Marlin]] in 1994-1995, however his win was overshadowed by a crash coming to the flag that seriously<ref>https://twitter.com/roushfenway/status/1229602655883886592?s=20</ref> injured [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Daytona 500}}\n\n[[Category:History of Florida]]\n[[Category:History of NASCAR]]\n[[Category:NASCAR races at Daytona International Speedway]]\n", "name_user": "2600:6c5e:880:1839:686e:6b6e:b8a8:950a", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePre-race history)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytona_500_history"}

{"title_page": "Faucet aerator", "text_new": "{{short description|Water conservation device}}\n[[Image:Faucet2.JPG|thumb|An aerator attached to a sink tap]]\n\nA '''faucet aerator''' (or '''tap aerator''') is often found at the tip of modern indoor water [[faucets]].  Aerators can be simply screwed onto the faucet head, creating a non-splashing stream and often delivering a mixture of water and air.\n\n==Function==\nAn aerator can:<ref name=\"ruhnke\" />\n* Prevent splashing\n* Shape the water stream coming out of the faucet spout, to produce a straight and evenly pressured stream\n* [[Water conservation | Conserve water]] and reduce energy costs\n* Reduce faucet noise \n* Increase perceived water pressure (often used in homes with low water pressure); sometimes described as a [[pressure regulator]] or flow regulator\n* Provide slight filtration of debris due to a small sieve plate\n\n===Splash prevention===\nWhen a single stream of water hits a surface the water must go somewhere, and because the stream is uniform the water will tend to go mostly in the same direction. If a single stream hits a surface which is curved, then the stream will conform to the shape and be easily redirected with the force of the volume of water falling. Adding the aerator does two things: reducing the volume of falling water which reduces the splash distance, and creating multiple \"mini-streams\" within the main stream. Each mini-stream, if it were falling by itself would splash or flow in a unique and different way when it hit the surface, as compared to the other mini-streams. Because they are all falling at the same time, the streams will splash in their own way but end up hitting other splash streams. The resulting interference cancels out the majority of the splashing effect.\n\n===Conservation and energy reduction===\nBecause the aerator limits the water flow through the faucet, water usage is reduced compared to the same duration of flow without an aerator.

However, the real \"boom\" of Benidorm as a coastal resort did not happen until the 1950s, when it became a famous summer destination for people coming from inland Spain, especially [[Madrid]]. Today it is known for its hotel industry, beaches and skyscrapers and receives as many or even slightly more foreign tourists as Spanish ones. According to the 2014 census, Benidorm has a permanent population of 69,010 inhabitants, making it the fifth most populous town in the Alicante province and the ninth in [[Valencian Community]].<ref>Burdett, Ricky & Sudjic, Deyan. ''The Endless City''. Phaidon Press Ltd. 1 March 2008.</ref>\n\n==History==\nIt is thought there were settlements in the Benidorm area possibly as far back as 3000 BC, including evidence of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Punic]] remains. However, settlements in the area were small and it was not until the arrival of the [[Moors]] that the local population began to grow during the era of the [[Umayad dynasty]]. The Christian King [[James I of Aragon]] reconquered the region in 1245 and Benidorm first officially became known in 1325, when Admiral [[Bernat de Sarri\u00e0]] of [[Polop]] awarded it a town charter as a way of removing the Moors and allowing Christians to inhabit the area. Strategically, the town was also used by Bernat de Sarri\u00e0 to stop the rising power of Admiral [[Roger of Lauria]], lord of [[Altea]], in the south of the [[Kingdom of Valencia]].<ref>''Carta de Poblament de Benidorm'' (Benidorm Population Letter). R. Alemany, A. Couto, J. Hinojosa and M. Cabanes. 1987. Benidorm City Council</ref>\n\nBenidorm's history for the next few centuries was plagued by attacks from the sea by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Barbary corsairs|Barbary pirates]]. The 17th century saw conditions improve for Benidorm and its people, most notably with the construction of an advanced irrigation system in 1666 to channel water to the region. By the 18th century Benidorm fishermen had become famous and sought after all over Spain and beyond. [[Tuna]] was their main catch and they perfected the ancient [[almadraba]] technique dating from Islamic times. The success of the fishing industry, together with improved local agriculture, helped to fuel a strong local economy. Coastal traffic increased too, bringing more wealth to the region with the town becoming a base for sea captains and the building of their vessels.\n\nIn 1952 Benidorm's fishing industry went into decline; this was a factor in encouraging the town council to approve many new development plans aimed at the tourist market. Today the town is Europe's and Spain's biggest holiday resort{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} and responsible for a significant chunk of Spain's large tourist industry, with five million tourist arrivals per year.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Local politics==\n\nAfter giving the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] majorities or pluralities in elections from the restoration of democracy in 1977, Benidorm has favoured the right wing [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) since the general elections of 1993.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040208160011/http://www.pre.gva.es/pls/argos_elec/DMEDB_ElecMunicipios.informeElec?aNMuniId=3031&aVLengua=v election results in Benidorm]</ref> The PP gained control of the local council at the 1995 local elections and won 14 of the 25 council seats in the 1999 and 2003 elections. The 2007 election gave them a one-seat majority over the PSOE,<ref>[http://www1.pre.gva.es/pls/argos_elec/DMEDB_Elecmunicipios.informeElecDetallado?aNMuniId=3031&aNNumElec=1&aVTipoElec=L&aVFechaElec=2007&aVLengua=v 2007 local election]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> but disagreements in the PP group led to a motion of censure being passed against the PP mayor in September 2009.

Between the two beaches lies a rocky promontory and the port.\n\nThe old city occupies the promontory and the area immediately inland, while most of the hotels occupy the more recently developed sections inland from the two beaches. A few miles from shore is an uninhabited [[Benidorm Island|island]] known as Benidorm Island or Peacock Island (due to previously having a peacock enclosure) which provides a dramatic centrepiece to the seascape.\n\nIn 1954 [[Pedro Zaragoza|Pedro Zaragoza Orts]], the then young Mayor of Benidorm, created the ''Plan General de Ordenaci\u00f3n'' (city building plan) that ensured, via a complex construction formula, every building would have an area of leisure land, guaranteeing a future free of the excesses of cramped construction seen in other areas of Spain. It is the only city in Spain that still adheres to this rigid rule. Most of the streets in the city are named after places such as Avenida de Uruguay, Avenida del Mediterr\u00e1neo, Calle Pek\u00edn, etc. Avenida del Mediterr\u00e1neo is a wide avenue that crosses Levante and links the old town with Rinc\u00f3n. Avenida Europa crosses Levante at right angles linking the western city limits with the Levante beach.\n\nBenidorm is connected to the [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat Valenciana|FGV]] railway line between Alicante (''Alacant'') and D\u00e9nia. The section to Alicante is now converted to tram operation and trams run at least every half an hour between Benidorm and Alicante (see [[Alicante Tram]]). Trains run hourly from Benidorm to D\u00e9nia (via Altea and Calpe), connecting with the trams at Benidorm station.\n\n===Climate===\nBenidorm has a [[semi-arid climate|hot semi arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''BSh'') with very mild winters and hot summers. The city receives slightly more than 300&nbsp;mm in precipitation per year and the wettest season is the mid-late Autumn, which prevents it from being classified as Mediterranean. It enjoys more than 3,000 hours of sunshine per year and the average annual temperature is around {{convert|19-20|C|F}}. The typical maximum temperatures during winter range from 16 to 22&nbsp;\u00b0C, while the lows range from 6 to 12&nbsp;\u00b0C. The temperature oscillation is small, being even smaller during summers, during the summer the maximum temperatures normally range from 28 to 32&nbsp;\u00b0C while the lows range from 20 to 24&nbsp;\u00b0C. In almost all of the summer months the city minimum temperatures at night remain above 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F), a phenomenon referred to as \"[[tropical night]]\" by Spanish meteorologists.<ref>http://noticias.eltiempo.es/2016/08/02/que-es-una-noche-tropical/</ref>\n\n{|style=\"width:100%;text-align:center;line-height:1.2em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|-\n!Colspan=14|Climate data for Benidorm\n|-\n!Month\n!Jan\n!Feb\n!Mar\n!Apr\n!May\n!Jun\n!Jul\n!Aug\n!Sep\n!Oct\n!Nov\n!Dec\n!style=\"border-left-width:medium\"|Year\n|-\n!Average sea temperature \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n|style=\"background:#D8D8FF;color:#000000;\"|14.4<br />(58.0)\n|style=\"background:#D2D2FF;color:#000000;\"|14.0<br />(57.2)\n|style=\"background:#D6D6FF;color:#000000;\"|14.3<br />(57.7)\n|style=\"background:#FFD95D;color:#000000;\"|16.3<br />(61.4)\n|style=\"background:#FFD95D;color:#000000;\"|18.9<br />(66.1)\n|style=\"background:#FF9300;color:#000000;\"|22.5<br />(72.4)\n|style=\"background:#FF6000;color:#000000;\"|25.1<br />(77.1)\n|style=\"background:#FF4C00;color:#000000;\"|26.1<br />(79.0)\n|style=\"background:#FF6400;color:#000000;\"|24.9<br />(76.8)\n|style=\"background:#FF9500;color:#000000;\"|22.4<br />(72.3)\n|style=\"background:#FFD13B;color:#000000;\"|19.3<br />(66.8)\n|style=\"background:#FFD95D;color:#000000;\"|16.4<br />(61.5)\n|style=\"background:#FFCC26;color:#000000;border-left-width:medium\"|19.6<br />(67.2)\n|-\n!Mean daily daylight hours\n|style=\"background:#F0F011;color:#000000;\"|10.0\n|style=\"background:#F7F722;color:#000000;\"|11.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"|12.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF44;color:#000000;\"|13.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF55;color:#000000;\"|14.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF66;color:#000000;\"|15.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF66;color:#000000;\"|15.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF55;color:#000000;\"|14.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"|12.0\n|style=\"background:#F7F722;color:#000000;\"|11.0\n|style=\"background:#F0F011;color:#000000;\"|10.0\n|style=\"background:#F0F011;color:#000000;\"|10.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF37;color:#000000;\"|12.3\n|-\n!Average [[Ultraviolet index]]\n|style=\"background:#289500;color:#000000;\"|2\n|style=\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;\"|3\n|style=\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;\"|5\n|style=\"background:#f85900;color:#000000;\"|6\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\"|8\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\"|9\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\"|10\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\"|9\n|style=\"background:#f85900;color:#000000;\"|7\n|style=\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;\"|4\n|style=\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;\"|3\n|style=\"background:#289500;color:#000000;\"|2\n|style=\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;border-left-width:medium\"|5.6\n|-\n!Colspan=14 style=\"background:#f8f9fa;font-weight:normal;font-size:95%;\"|Source: Weather Atlas <ref name=\"Weather Atlas\">{{cite web |url=https://www.weather-atlas.com/en/spain/benidorm-climate |title=Benidorm, Spain \u2013 Climate data |publisher=Weather Atlas |access-date=16 March 2017 }}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Benidormskyline.JPG|thumb|right|Benidorm skyline]]\n[[File:Benidorm desde el mar 02 JMM.JPG|thumb|right|Poniente Beach in Benidorm]]\n[[File:Sierrahelada.jpg|thumb|right|Benidorm seen from the mountain [[Puig Campana]] (1,400 [[meters above sea level|masl]]) in January]]\n\nBenidorm is popular with tourists from the UK, Ireland, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Benidorm's initial growth in popularity can be attributed to the [[package holiday]] explosion, and continues year round, due to the night-life based around the central concentration of bars and clubs.  The large number of free cabaret acts that start around 21:00 and continue into the early hours sets Benidorm apart from other similar cities.\n\nThe author and ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' journalist [[Giles Tremlett]] identified the city as the birthplace of package tourism in the book ''Ghosts of Spain: Travels Through a Country's Hidden Past'' and remarked that culturally the city contradicted conservative notions of National Catholicism that [[General Franco]] had espoused.<ref name=fv>{{cite book|year=2006|first=Giles |last=Tremlett|title=Ghosts of Spain: Travels Through a Country's Hidden Past|publisher=Faber and Faber}}</ref> The accessibility of Benidorm to a wider social strata made the town into an ever so easy target for highbrow sarcasm, as by [[Jani Allan]] in the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' in 1990: \"These days you just have to look at the numbers of wide-bodied jets bearing wide-bodied holidaymakers to Benidorm to realise that package holidays and airborne cattle trucks make fun in the sun accessible to everyone.\"<ref>[[Jani Allan|Allan, Jani]]. British determination to acquire a suntan; Is this the end of burning ambition? ''[[Sunday Times]]'', 6 May 1990</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s Benidorm developed a reputation for British drunken lager louts and violent binge drinking.  This did not happen all year round but mainly in the summer months of July and August.<ref>Clerks Travels 3rd ed 2007</ref> During the 1980s families were put off visiting the city.  However today the problem of drunkenness and lager louts has largely gone and Benidorm has mellowed. Now there is a very good police presence in the town which has greatly improved safety and provided for a good atmosphere.  Nightlife is very popular and mainly involves cabaret acts and tapas bars.\n\nThe town is now very popular with families. Also, more and more elderly people from Northern Europe decide to stay there during the winter. This made 'Benidorm' into something of a synonym for elderly people in those countries, as can be seen in the Flemish [[candid camera]] programme ''[[Benidorm Bastards]]''.<ref>[http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=DMF20111122_081 De Standaard Online \u2013 De Zweedse 'sexy bitch' en andere Benidorm Bastards] {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\nBenidorm has three major beaches: ''Playa de Levante'' ([[Valencian]]: ''Platja de Llevant''), ''Playa de Poniente'' (Valencian: ''Platja de Ponent'') and ''Playa de Mal Pas'' (Valencian: ''Platja del Mal Pas''); all of them have had a [[Blue Flag beach|blue flag]] since 1987, the maximum quality standard recognised by the [[European Union]].  The [[Gran Hotel Bali]], a [[hotel rating|four-star hotel]] located in this city since 2002, is a 186-metre-tall building which stood as the [[List of tallest structures in Spain|tallest skyscraper in Spain]] for five years, until it was surpassed by the [[Cuatro Torres Business Area|CTBA]] towers in [[Madrid]] and [[Intempo]] building, also in Benidorm. Intempo building is currently the [[List of tallest buildings in Spain|fifth tallest of Spain]] and the tallest building in the [[Valencian Community]].\n\n===Events and attractions===\nEach summer, since 1959 to 2000, the city celebrated the [[Benidorm International Song Festival]], a song contest where international or Spanish celebrities such as [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Raphael (singer)|Raphael]] or the [[D\u00fao Din\u00e1mico]] became famous.\n\nSince 2010, in July, Benidorm celebrates an [[indie music]] festival, with national and international music groups, called \"Benidorm Low Festival\".\n\nIn 2011, Benidorm hosted the start of the [[2011 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]], one of cycling's three [[Grand Tour (cycling)|grand tours]].\n\nBenidorm boasts three family-oriented theme parks: [[Terra M\u00edtica]] is inland from the city, at the foot of the mountain, and [[Aqualandia]] and [[Mundomar]] are located on the outskirts of the city on the Levante side. There are lots of [https://www.in2town.co.uk/benidorm/things-to-do-in-benidorm/ things to do in Benidorm] for all ages. With all the family attractions available, Benidorm has been described as one of the most family oriented holiday destinations in Spain and Europe. In addition to large shopping and commercial areas. An episode of the hit British sitcom ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' was set in Benidorm. The episode was called \"[[It Never Rains...]]\".\n \nA TV series called ''[[Benidorm (TV series)|Benidorm]]'' has aired on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] (with replays on [[ITV2]]) in the UK. Actors include [[Jake Canuso]], [[Steve Pemberton]], [[Sheila Reid]] and comedian [[Johnny Vegas]].

coast.\n\nBenidorm has been a tourist destination within Spain since 1925, when its port was extended and the first hotels were built. However, the real \"boom\" of Benidorm as a coastal resort did not happen until the 1950s, when it became a famous summer destination for people coming from inland Spain, especially [[Madrid]]. Today it is known for its hotel industry, beaches and skyscrapers and receives as many or even slightly more foreign tourists as Spanish ones. According to the 2014 census, Benidorm has a permanent population of 69,010 inhabitants, making it the fifth most populous town in the Alicante province and the ninth in [[Valencian Community]].<ref>Burdett, Ricky & Sudjic, Deyan. ''The Endless City''. Phaidon Press Ltd. 1 March 2008.</ref>\n\n==History==\nIt is thought there were settlements in the Benidorm area possibly as far back as 3000 BC, including evidence of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Punic]] remains. However, settlements in the area were small and it was not until the arrival of the [[Moors]] that the local population began to grow during the era of the [[Umayad dynasty]]. The Christian King [[James I of Aragon]] reconquered the region in 1245 and Benidorm first officially became known in 1325, when Admiral [[Bernat de Sarri\u00e0]] of [[Polop]] awarded it a town charter as a way of removing the Moors and allowing Christians to inhabit the area. Strategically, the town was used by Bernat de Sarri\u00e0 to stop the raising power of Admiral [[Roger of Lauria]], lord of [[Altea]], in the south of the [[Kingdom of Valencia]].<ref>''Carta de Poblament de Benidorm'' (Benidorm Population Letter). R. Alemany, A. Couto, J. Hinojosa and M. Cabanes. 1987. Benidorm City Council</ref>\n\nBenidorm's history for the next few centuries was plagued by attacks from the sea by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Barbary corsairs|Barbary pirates]]. The 17th century saw conditions improve for Benidorm and its people, most notably with the construction of an advanced irrigation system in 1666 to channel water to the region. By the 18th century Benidorm fishermen had become famous and sought after all over Spain and beyond. [[Tuna]] was their main catch and they perfected the ancient [[almadraba]] technique dating from Islamic times. The success of the fishing industry, together with improved local agriculture, helped to fuel a strong local economy. Coastal traffic increased too, bringing more wealth to the region with the town becoming a base for sea captains and the building of their vessels.\n\nIn 1952 Benidorm's fishing industry went into decline; this was a factor in encouraging the town council to approve many new development plans aimed at the tourist market. Today the town is Europe's and Spain's biggest holiday resort{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} and responsible for a significant chunk of Spain's large tourist industry, with five million tourist arrivals per year.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Local politics==\n\nAfter giving the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] majorities or pluralities in elections from the restoration of democracy in 1977, Benidorm has favoured the right wing [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] (PP) since the general elections of 1993.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040208160011/http://www.pre.gva.es/pls/argos_elec/DMEDB_ElecMunicipios.informeElec?aNMuniId=3031&aVLengua=v election results in Benidorm]</ref> The PP gained control of the local council at the 1995 local elections and won 14 of the 25 council seats in the 1999 and 2003 elections. The 2007 election gave them a one-seat majority over the PSOE,<ref>[http://www1.pre.gva.es/pls/argos_elec/DMEDB_Elecmunicipios.informeElecDetallado?aNMuniId=3031&aNNumElec=1&aVTipoElec=L&aVFechaElec=2007&aVLengua=v 2007 local election]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> but disagreements in the PP group led to a motion of censure being passed against the PP mayor in September 2009. He was replaced by the socialist Agust\u00edn Navarro.<ref>[http://www.lasprovincias.es/valencia/20090922/local/politica/mocion-censura-benidorm-200909221032.html Las Provincias 22 September 2009]</ref> In 2019, PP won the local elections, obtaining an absolute majority.  \n \nAs of the 2019 local elections, the political composition on the local council was the following:<ref name=\"resultados.elpais.com\">http://resultados.elpais.com/elecciones/2015/municipales/17/03/31.html</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" align=\"center\" valign=\"top\" | Party<ref name=\"resultados.elpais.com\"/>\n! valign=\"top\"| Seats\n|-\n|{{Party name with color|People's Party (Spain)}}\n| 13\n|-\n|{{Party name with color|Spanish Socialist Workers' Party}}\n| 10\n|-\n|{{Party name with color|Citizens (Spanish political party)}}\n| 2\n|-\n|}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:2018.05-465-142ap2 Benidorm & Benidorm Island from the air CDG-OUA mon07may2018-1654h.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Benidorm and Benidorm Island looking eastward (May 2018).]]\n\nThe town is divided into five parts: ''Poniente'' (''Ponent'' or 'sun setting') and ''Levante'' (''Llevant'' or 'sun rising'), each fronted by a beach of the same name; the old town (also called ''El Castell''); ''La Cala'' situated to the west side of Poniente; and ''El Rinc\u00f3n de Loix'' (or ''El Rac\u00f3 de l'Oix'') situated to the east side of Levante. Between the two beaches lies a rocky promontory and the port.\n\nThe old city occupies the promontory and the area immediately inland, while most of the hotels occupy the more recently developed sections inland from the two beaches. A few miles from shore is an uninhabited [[Benidorm Island|island]] known as Benidorm Island or Peacock Island (due to previously having a peacock enclosure) which provides a dramatic centrepiece to the seascape.\n\nIn 1954 [[Pedro Zaragoza|Pedro Zaragoza Orts]], the then young Mayor of Benidorm, created the ''Plan General de Ordenaci\u00f3n'' (city building plan) that ensured, via a complex construction formula, every building would have an area of leisure land, guaranteeing a future free of the excesses of cramped construction seen in other areas of Spain. It is the only city in Spain that still adheres to this rigid rule. Most of the streets in the city are named after places such as Avenida de Uruguay, Avenida del Mediterr\u00e1neo, Calle Pek\u00edn, etc. Avenida del Mediterr\u00e1neo is a wide avenue that crosses Levante and links the old town with Rinc\u00f3n. Avenida Europa crosses Levante at right angles linking the western city limits with the Levante beach.\n\nBenidorm is connected to the [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat Valenciana|FGV]] railway line between Alicante (''Alacant'') and D\u00e9nia. The section to Alicante is now converted to tram operation and trams run at least every half an hour between Benidorm and Alicante (see [[Alicante Tram]]). Trains run hourly from Benidorm to D\u00e9nia (via Altea and Calpe), connecting with the trams at Benidorm station.\n\n===Climate===\nBenidorm has a [[semi-arid climate|hot semi arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''BSh'') with very mild winters and hot summers. The city receives slightly more than 300&nbsp;mm in precipitation per year and the wettest season is the mid-late Autumn, which prevents it from being classified as Mediterranean. It enjoys more than 3,000 hours of sunshine per year and the average annual temperature is around {{convert|19-20|C|F}}. The typical maximum temperatures during winter range from 16 to 22&nbsp;\u00b0C, while the lows range from 6 to 12&nbsp;\u00b0C. The temperature oscillation is small, being even smaller during summers, during the summer the maximum temperatures normally range from 28 to 32&nbsp;\u00b0C while the lows range from 20 to 24&nbsp;\u00b0C. In almost all of the summer months the city minimum temperatures at night remain above 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F), a phenomenon referred to as \"[[tropical night]]\" by Spanish meteorologists.<ref>http://noticias.eltiempo.es/2016/08/02/que-es-una-noche-tropical/</ref>\n\n{|style=\"width:100%;text-align:center;line-height:1.2em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|-\n!Colspan=14|Climate data for Benidorm\n|-\n!Month\n!Jan\n!Feb\n!Mar\n!Apr\n!May\n!Jun\n!Jul\n!Aug\n!Sep\n!Oct\n!Nov\n!Dec\n!style=\"border-left-width:medium\"|Year\n|-\n!Average sea temperature \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n|style=\"background:#D8D8FF;color:#000000;\"|14.4<br />(58.0)\n|style=\"background:#D2D2FF;color:#000000;\"|14.0<br />(57.2)\n|style=\"background:#D6D6FF;color:#000000;\"|14.3<br />(57.7)\n|style=\"background:#FFD95D;color:#000000;\"|16.3<br />(61.4)\n|style=\"background:#FFD95D;color:#000000;\"|18.9<br />(66.1)\n|style=\"background:#FF9300;color:#000000;\"|22.5<br />(72.4)\n|style=\"background:#FF6000;color:#000000;\"|25.1<br />(77.1)\n|style=\"background:#FF4C00;color:#000000;\"|26.1<br />(79.0)\n|style=\"background:#FF6400;color:#000000;\"|24.9<br />(76.8)\n|style=\"background:#FF9500;color:#000000;\"|22.4<br />(72.3)\n|style=\"background:#FFD13B;color:#000000;\"|19.3<br />(66.8)\n|style=\"background:#FFD95D;color:#000000;\"|16.4<br />(61.5)\n|style=\"background:#FFCC26;color:#000000;border-left-width:medium\"|19.6<br />(67.2)\n|-\n!Mean daily daylight hours\n|style=\"background:#F0F011;color:#000000;\"|10.0\n|style=\"background:#F7F722;color:#000000;\"|11.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"|12.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF44;color:#000000;\"|13.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF55;color:#000000;\"|14.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF66;color:#000000;\"|15.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF66;color:#000000;\"|15.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF55;color:#000000;\"|14.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"|12.0\n|style=\"background:#F7F722;color:#000000;\"|11.0\n|style=\"background:#F0F011;color:#000000;\"|10.0\n|style=\"background:#F0F011;color:#000000;\"|10.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF37;color:#000000;\"|12.3\n|-\n!Average [[Ultraviolet index]]\n|style=\"background:#289500;color:#000000;\"|2\n|style=\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;\"|3\n|style=\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;\"|5\n|style=\"background:#f85900;color:#000000;\"|6\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\"|8\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\"|9\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\"|10\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\"|9\n|style=\"background:#f85900;color:#000000;\"|7\n|style=\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;\"|4\n|style=\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;\"|3\n|style=\"background:#289500;color:#000000;\"|2\n|style=\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;border-left-width:medium\"|5.6\n|-\n!Colspan=14 style=\"background:#f8f9fa;font-weight:normal;font-size:95%;\"|Source: Weather Atlas <ref name=\"Weather Atlas\">{{cite web |url=https://www.weather-atlas.com/en/spain/benidorm-climate |title=Benidorm, Spain \u2013 Climate data |publisher=Weather Atlas |access-date=16 March 2017 }}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Benidormskyline.JPG|thumb|right|Benidorm skyline]]\n[[File:Benidorm desde el mar 02 JMM.JPG|thumb|right|Poniente Beach in Benidorm]]\n[[File:Sierrahelada.jpg|thumb|right|Benidorm seen from the mountain [[Puig Campana]] (1,400 [[meters above sea level|masl]]) in January]]\n\nBenidorm is popular with tourists from the UK, Ireland, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Benidorm's initial growth in popularity can be attributed to the [[package holiday]] explosion, and continues year round, due to the night-life based around the central concentration of bars and clubs.  The large number of free cabaret acts that start around 21:00 and continue into the early hours sets Benidorm apart from other similar cities.\n\nThe author and ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' journalist [[Giles Tremlett]] identified the city as the birthplace of package tourism in the book ''Ghosts of Spain: Travels Through a Country's Hidden Past'' and remarked that culturally the city contradicted conservative notions of National Catholicism that [[General Franco]] had espoused.<ref name=fv>{{cite book|year=2006|first=Giles |last=Tremlett|title=Ghosts of Spain: Travels Through a Country's Hidden Past|publisher=Faber and Faber}}</ref> The accessibility of Benidorm to a wider social strata made the town into an ever so easy target for highbrow sarcasm, as by [[Jani Allan]] in the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' in 1990: \"These days you just have to look at the numbers of wide-bodied jets bearing wide-bodied holidaymakers to Benidorm to realise that package holidays and airborne cattle trucks make fun in the sun accessible to everyone.\"<ref>[[Jani Allan|Allan, Jani]]. British determination to acquire a suntan; Is this the end of burning ambition? ''[[Sunday Times]]'', 6 May 1990</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s Benidorm developed a reputation for British drunken lager louts and violent binge drinking.  This did not happen all year round but mainly in the summer months of July and August.<ref>Clerks Travels 3rd ed 2007</ref> During the 1980s families were put off visiting the city.  However today the problem of drunkenness and lager louts has largely gone and Benidorm has mellowed. Now there is a very good police presence in the town which has greatly improved safety and provided for a good atmosphere.  Nightlife is very popular and mainly involves cabaret acts and tapas bars.\n\nThe town is now very popular with families. Also, more and more elderly people from Northern Europe decide to stay there during the winter. This made 'Benidorm' into something of a synonym for elderly people in those countries, as can be seen in the Flemish [[candid camera]] programme ''[[Benidorm Bastards]]''.<ref>[http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=DMF20111122_081 De Standaard Online \u2013 De Zweedse 'sexy bitch' en andere Benidorm Bastards] {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\nBenidorm has three major beaches: ''Playa de Levante'' ([[Valencian]]: ''Platja de Llevant''), ''Playa de Poniente'' (Valencian: ''Platja de Ponent'') and ''Playa de Mal Pas'' (Valencian: ''Platja del Mal Pas''); all of them have had a [[Blue Flag beach|blue flag]] since 1987, the maximum quality standard recognised by the [[European Union]].  The [[Gran Hotel Bali]], a [[hotel rating|four-star hotel]] located in this city since 2002, is a 186-metre-tall building which stood as the [[List of tallest structures in Spain|tallest skyscraper in Spain]] for five years, until it was surpassed by the [[Cuatro Torres Business Area|CTBA]] towers in [[Madrid]] and [[Intempo]] building, also in Benidorm.
