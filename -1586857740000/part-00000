[[Colorado]], United States and is immediately west of [[El Paso County, Colorado|El Paso County]] and the unincorporated community of [[Crystola, Colorado|Crystola]].  Many residents in this [[bedroom community]], which is surrounded by the one-million acre (4,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) [[Pike National Forest]], make the {{convert|17|mi|km|adj=on}} commute to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. [[Ute Pass]] lies {{convert|12|mi|km}} to the west of Woodland Park on [[U.S. Highway 24 (Colorado)|US 24]]. The population was 7200 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]]. Nearby [[Douglas County, Colorado|Douglas County]] is about a fifteen-minute drive from the city.\n\nA post office called Woodland Park has been in operation since 1890.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.postalhistory.com/postoffices.asp?state=CO | title=Post offices | publisher=Jim Forte Postal History | accessdate=11 July 2016}}</ref> The community was named for the abundance of trees near the original town site.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=John Frank|title=Place names in Colorado: why 700 communities were so named, 150 of Spanish or Indian origin|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015051116740;view=1up;seq=58|publisher=The J. Frank Dawson Publishing Co.|location=Denver, CO|page=52}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=January 2019}}\nOn January 28, 1891, Woodland Park was officially incorporated with a population of 121 residents.  The early settlers needed a government loan to fund a water line installation from Loy Gulch into the town reservoir, now a pond in Memorial Park.  The founding fathers' first ordinance was to establish a morals and decency act; banning the sale of alcohol, and prohibiting gambling, obscene language and inappropriate attire.  With the new law in place to allow enforcement, the calaboose (i.e., Town Jail) was constructed in 1891 and is now located in History Park.\n\nHomesteaders, miners, loggers, health seekers and speculators were attracted to Woodland Park due to four (4) historical factors: Gold Rush 1857 - 1919; Colorado Midland Railway 1883 - 1949; lumber and timber mills 1873 - 1936; and resorts and tourism 1887 - 1955.  After the Colorado Midland Railway began operating in 1887, an infusion of travelers and new residents caused the town to grow with hotels, restaurants, livery stables, mercantile stores and homes.  This growth created the need for churches, schools and recreational activities, such as, rodeo events, dances and baseball games.\n\nThroughout the first half of the 20th Century, lumbering continued to be the area's largest, year-round, economic driver.  During the summer months, dude ranches were a great draw for tourist who enjoyed experiencing the Wild West and natural beauty of Pikes Peak country.  The Paradise Ranch was one of those ranches that put Woodland Park on the map along with the Woodland Park Rodeo Association.\n\n==Geography==\nWoodland Park is located at the eastern intersection of [[U.S. Highway 24 (Colorado)|U.S. Highway 24]] and [[Colorado State Highway 67|State Highway 67]].  (The highways [[overlap (road)|overlap]] west to [[Divide, Colorado|Divide]].)\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|5.7|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=left\n|1900= 269\n|1910= 163\n|1920= 125\n|1930= 194\n|1940= 372\n|1950= 391\n|1960= 666\n|1970= 1022\n|1980= 2634\n|1990= 4610\n|2000= 6515\n|2010= 7200\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=7785\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=September 1, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|website=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 6,515 people, 2,476 households, and 1,884 families residing in the city.

[[Colorado]], United States and is immediately west of [[El Paso County, Colorado|El Paso County]] and the unincorporated community of [[Crystola, Colorado|Crystola]].  Many residents in this [[bedroom community]], which is surrounded by the one-million acre (4,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) [[Pike National Forest]], make the {{convert|17|mi|km|adj=on}} commute to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. [[Ute Pass]] lies {{convert|12|mi|km}} to the west of Woodland Park on [[U.S. Highway 24 (Colorado)|US 24]]. The population was 7200 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]]. Nearby [[Douglas County, Colorado|Douglas County]] is about a fifteen-minute drive from the city.\n\nA post office called Woodland Park has been in operation since 1890.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.postalhistory.com/postoffices.asp?state=CO | title=Post offices | publisher=Jim Forte Postal History | accessdate=11 July 2016}}</ref> The community was named for the abundance of trees near the original town site.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=John Frank|title=Place names in Colorado: why 700 communities were so named, 150 of Spanish or Indian origin|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015051116740;view=1up;seq=58|publisher=The J. Frank Dawson Publishing Co.|location=Denver, CO|page=52}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=January 2019}}\nOn January 28, 1891, Woodland Park was officially incorporated with a population of 121 residents.  The early settlers needed a government loan to fund a water line installation from Loy Gulch into the town reservoir, now a pond in Memorial Park.  The founding fathers' first ordinance was to establish a morals and decency act; banning the sale of alcohol, and prohibiting gambling, obscene language and inappropriate attire.  With the new law in place to allow enforcement, the calaboose (i.e., Town Jail) was constructed in 1891 and is now located in History Park.\n\nHomesteaders, miners, loggers, health seekers and speculators were attracted to Woodland Park due to four (4) historical factors: Gold Rush 1857 - 1919; Colorado Midland Railway 1883 - 1949; lumber and timber mills 1873 - 1936; and resorts and tourism 1887 - 1955.  After the Colorado Midland Railway began operating in 1887, an infusion of travelers and new residents caused the town to grow with hotels, restaurants, livery stables, mercantile stores and homes.  This growth created the need for churches, schools and recreational activities, such as, rodeo events, dances and baseball games.\n\nThroughout the first half of the 20th Century, lumbering continued to be the area's largest, year-round, economic driver.  During the summer months, dude ranches were a great draw for tourist who enjoyed experiencing the Wild West and natural beauty of Pikes Peak country.  The Paradise Ranch was one of those ranches that put Woodland Park on the map along with the Woodland Park Rodeo Association.\n\n==Geography==\nWoodland Park is located at the eastern intersection of [[U.S. Highway 24 (Colorado)|U.S. Highway 24]] and [[Colorado State Highway 67|State Highway 67]].  (The highways [[overlap (road)|overlap]] west to [[Divide, Colorado|Divide]].)\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|5.7|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=left\n|1900= 269\n|1910= 163\n|1920= 125\n|1930= 194\n|1940= 372\n|1950= 391\n|1960= 666\n|1970= 1022\n|1980= 2634\n|1990= 4610\n|2000= 6515\n|2010= 7200\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=7785\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=September 1, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|website=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 6,515 people, 2,476 households, and 1,884 families residing in the city.

{"title_page": "Frank Fraser Darling", "text_new": "{{for|the Canadian architect|Frank Darling (architect)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2013}}\n'''Sir Frank Fraser Darling''' [[FRSE]] (23 June 1903 \u2013 22 October 1979) was an English ecologist, [[ornithologist]], farmer, [[Conservation movement|conservationist]] and author, who is strongly associated with the highlands and islands of [[Scotland]]. He gives his name to the [[Fraser Darling effect]].\n\n==Early life==\nFraser Darling was born in Soresby Street in [[Chesterfield]]<ref>https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf</ref> in northern England, the [[illegitimate]] son of Harriet Cowley Ellse Darling and Cpt. Frank Moss. His mother was the daughter of a prosperous family from [[Sheffield]]. Her family wanted the child to be [[foster care|fostered]] and forgotten about. However, she would not cooperate and refused to part with Frank. His father, whom he never met, left for East Africa around the time of his birth, and was killed in action on the [[Kenya]]-[[Tanganyika]] border in 1917. In 1966 Darling revealed to his son that  the pioneering plant geographer, [[Charles Edward Moss]], was his uncle.<ref>Letter from F. Fraser Darling to Alasdair Fraser-Darling, 26 March 1966. St Andrew's University Library Special Collections,  ms38449.</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAfter running away from school at the age of 15, Darling was sent to work on a farm in the [[Pennines]]. He then studied at the Midland Agricultural College (now part of the [[University of Nottingham]]), at Sutton Bonington in the Borough of Rushcliffe in [[Nottinghamshire]], and obtained diplomas in agriculture and [[Dairy farming|dairying]]. Soon afterwards he married Marion Fraser (\"Bobbie\") and took the [[double-barrelled surname]] Fraser Darling, which, although he was divorced from Bobbie in 1948, he used until the end of his life.\n\nWhile working as a Clean Milk Advisor in [[Buckinghamshire]], and longing for a research post in [[Scotland]], Fraser Darling heard about the work of the Institute of Animal Genetics at [[Edinburgh University]], and in the early 1930s the Director, [[Francis Albert Eley Crew]], offered him a place there to study for a PhD<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Darling|first=Frank Fraser|date=1930|title=Studies in the biology of the fleece of the Scottish mountain Blackface breed of sheep|url=https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/32298|language=en}}</ref>. From 1929\u20131930 he was Director of the Commonwealth Bureau of Animal Breeding and Genetics, part of the [[CAB International|Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux]], at Edinburgh.\n\nIn 1934 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Francis Albert Eley Crew]], [[William Christopher Miller]], [[Alick Buchanan-Smith, Baron Balerno|A D Buchanan Smith (Lord Balerno)]], and [[John Michael Robson]].<ref>https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf</ref>\n\nLiving at Dundonnell and later in the [[Summer Isles]], Fraser Darling began the work that was to mark him as a naturalist-philosopher of original turn of mind and great intellectual drive. He described the social and breeding behaviour of the [[red deer]], [[gulls]], and the [[grey seal]] respectively, in the three academic works ''A Herd of Red Deer'', ''Bird Flocks and the Breeding Cycle'' and ''A Naturalist on [[North Rona|Rona]]''. The [[Fraser Darling effect]], proposed by Fraser Darling in 1938, is the simultaneous and shortened [[breeding season]] that occurs in large colonies of birds.<ref>{{cite web| title=Fraser Darling effect| publisher=Dictionary of Zoology| year=1999| author=Michael Allaby| accessdate=2012-05-26| url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Fraser_Darling_effect.aspx}}</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Second World War]] put an end to Fraser Darling's hopes of undertaking further research on the grey seal and, being too old for active military service, he chose to farm rather than leave the west coast of Scotland for wartime civilian work. Between 1939 and 1943 Fraser Darling reclaimed derelict land to agricultural production on [[Tanera M\u00f2r]] in the Summer Isles. In 1942, the wartime [[Secretary of State for Scotland]], [[Tom Johnston (Scottish politician)|Thomas Johnston]], asked him to run an agricultural advisory programme in the [[crofting]] areas of the [[Scottish Highlands]] and Islands. He agreed, and for two years he travelled, taught and wrote articles that were later published in book form as ''Crofting Agriculture''.  In 1944 he was appointed as Director of the West Highland Survey based at Kilcamb Lodge on the Strontian Estate in [[Ardnamurchan]]<ref>Hunter, James (1984), ''Forgotten Blueprint for the Highlands'', The Weekend Scotsman, 20 October 1984</ref>  \n\nThe aim of the West Highland Survey, Fraser Darling wrote, was \"to gather a solid body of facts... which would serve as a foundation for a future policy for the region\".  To gather these facts, he recruited five assistants, all young Highlanders: people personally acquainted with the crofting life who could converse with crofters in their native Gaelic rather than in the English of officialdom.  Concerns at the Department of Agriculture about the radical nature of the findings of the survey and its implied criticism of the policies it had been pursuing led to repeated delays to its publication.  It was finally published as ''West Highland Survey: An Essay in Human Ecology'' in 1955.  In the concluding sentence of his introduction Fraser Darling wrote that: \"the bald unpalatable fact is emphasized that the Highlands and Islands are largely a devastated terrain, and that any policy which ignores this fact cannot hope to achieve rehabilitation.\"  The \"devastation\", he further concluded, was the inevitable outcome of bad land use.  The Highlands had first been stripped of their natural forest cover, then they had been subjected to repeated burning, to intensive grazing, to overstocking and to other forms of maltreatment which had drained their soils of fertility and made them steadily less productive.<ref>Fraser Darling, Frank (1955), ''West Highland Survey: An Essay in Human Ecology'', Oxford University Press</ref>  [[Frank Mears]] drew on the preliminary report of the ''West Highland Survey'' (1948)<ref>Fraser Darling, Frank (1948), ''Preliminary Report of the West Highland Survey''</ref> in his interim report on planning and redevelopment in the County of Sutherland (1951).<ref>Mears, F.C. (1951), ''County of Sutherland: Interim Report on Planning and Development'', Sutherland County Council, June 1951, p. 20</ref>\n\nIn 1949, [[Julian Huxley]], [[UNESCO]]'s first Director-General, invited Fraser Darling to be one of UNESCO's representatives at the United Nations conference on conservation at [[Lake Success, New York|Lake Success]] on [[Long Island]]. Huxley had been interested in Fraser Darling's studies on animal behaviour since the early 1940s, and the two had corresponded while Fraser Darling was living on Tanera Mor.\n\nHis 1969 BBC [[Reith Lectures]] (entitled ''Wilderness and Plenty''<ref name=\"Reith\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h3xk5|title=The Reith Lectures: Frank Fraser Darling: ''Wilderness and Plenty'': 1969|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>) were an important contribution to the growing debate on man's responsibility for his [[natural environment]].

He gives his name to the [[Fraser Darling effect]].\n\n==Early life==\nFraser Darling was born in Soresby Street in [[Chesterfield]]<ref>https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf</ref> in northern England, the [[illegitimate]] son of Harriet Cowley Ellse Darling and Cpt. Frank Moss. His mother was the daughter of a prosperous family from [[Sheffield]]. Her family wanted the child to be [[foster care|fostered]] and forgotten about. However, she would not cooperate and refused to part with Frank. His father, whom he never met, left for East Africa around the time of his birth, and was killed in action on the [[Kenya]]-[[Tanganyika]] border in 1917. In 1966 Darling revealed to his son that  the pioneering plant geographer, [[Charles Edward Moss]], was his uncle.<ref>Letter from F. Fraser Darling to Alasdair Fraser-Darling, 26 March 1966. St Andrew's University Library Special Collections,  ms38449.</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAfter running away from school at the age of 15, Darling was sent to work on a farm in the [[Pennines]]. He then studied at the Midland Agricultural College (now part of the [[University of Nottingham]]), at Sutton Bonington in the Borough of Rushcliffe in [[Nottinghamshire]], and obtained diplomas in agriculture and [[Dairy farming|dairying]]. Soon afterwards he married Marion Fraser (\"Bobbie\") and took the [[double-barrelled surname]] Fraser Darling, which, although he was divorced from Bobbie in 1948, he used until the end of his life.\n\nWhile working as a Clean Milk Advisor in [[Buckinghamshire]], and longing for a research post in [[Scotland]], Fraser Darling heard about the work of the Institute of Animal Genetics at [[Edinburgh University]], and in the early 1930s the Director, [[Francis Albert Eley Crew]], offered him a place there to study for a PhD. From 1929\u20131930 he was Director of the Commonwealth Bureau of Animal Breeding and Genetics, part of the [[CAB International|Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux]], at Edinburgh.\n\nIn 1934 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Francis Albert Eley Crew]], [[William Christopher Miller]], [[Alick Buchanan-Smith, Baron Balerno|A D Buchanan Smith (Lord Balerno)]], and [[John Michael Robson]].<ref>https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf</ref>\n\nLiving at Dundonnell and later in the [[Summer Isles]], Fraser Darling began the work that was to mark him as a naturalist-philosopher of original turn of mind and great intellectual drive. He described the social and breeding behaviour of the [[red deer]], [[gulls]], and the [[grey seal]] respectively, in the three academic works ''A Herd of Red Deer'', ''Bird Flocks and the Breeding Cycle'' and ''A Naturalist on [[North Rona|Rona]]''. The [[Fraser Darling effect]], proposed by Fraser Darling in 1938, is the simultaneous and shortened [[breeding season]] that occurs in large colonies of birds.<ref>{{cite web| title=Fraser Darling effect| publisher=Dictionary of Zoology| year=1999| author=Michael Allaby| accessdate=2012-05-26| url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Fraser_Darling_effect.aspx}}</ref>\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Second World War]] put an end to Fraser Darling's hopes of undertaking further research on the grey seal and, being too old for active military service, he chose to farm rather than leave the west coast of Scotland for wartime civilian work. Between 1939 and 1943 Fraser Darling reclaimed derelict land to agricultural production on [[Tanera M\u00f2r]] in the Summer Isles. In 1942, the wartime [[Secretary of State for Scotland]], [[Tom Johnston (Scottish politician)|Thomas Johnston]], asked him to run an agricultural advisory programme in the [[crofting]] areas of the [[Scottish Highlands]] and Islands. He agreed, and for two years he travelled, taught and wrote articles that were later published in book form as ''Crofting Agriculture''.  In 1944 he was appointed as Director of the West Highland Survey based at Kilcamb Lodge on the Strontian Estate in [[Ardnamurchan]]<ref>Hunter, James (1984), ''Forgotten Blueprint for the Highlands'', The Weekend Scotsman, 20 October 1984</ref>  \n\nThe aim of the West Highland Survey, Fraser Darling wrote, was \"to gather a solid body of facts... which would serve as a foundation for a future policy for the region\".  To gather these facts, he recruited five assistants, all young Highlanders: people personally acquainted with the crofting life who could converse with crofters in their native Gaelic rather than in the English of officialdom.  Concerns at the Department of Agriculture about the radical nature of the findings of the survey and its implied criticism of the policies it had been pursuing led to repeated delays to its publication.  It was finally published as ''West Highland Survey: An Essay in Human Ecology'' in 1955.  In the concluding sentence of his introduction Fraser Darling wrote that: \"the bald unpalatable fact is emphasized that the Highlands and Islands are largely a devastated terrain, and that any policy which ignores this fact cannot hope to achieve rehabilitation.\"  The \"devastation\", he further concluded, was the inevitable outcome of bad land use.  The Highlands had first been stripped of their natural forest cover, then they had been subjected to repeated burning, to intensive grazing, to overstocking and to other forms of maltreatment which had drained their soils of fertility and made them steadily less productive.<ref>Fraser Darling, Frank (1955), ''West Highland Survey: An Essay in Human Ecology'', Oxford University Press</ref>  [[Frank Mears]] drew on the preliminary report of the ''West Highland Survey'' (1948)<ref>Fraser Darling, Frank (1948), ''Preliminary Report of the West Highland Survey''</ref> in his interim report on planning and redevelopment in the County of Sutherland (1951).<ref>Mears, F.C. (1951), ''County of Sutherland: Interim Report on Planning and Development'', Sutherland County Council, June 1951, p. 20</ref>\n\nIn 1949, [[Julian Huxley]], [[UNESCO]]'s first Director-General, invited Fraser Darling to be one of UNESCO's representatives at the United Nations conference on conservation at [[Lake Success, New York|Lake Success]] on [[Long Island]]. Huxley had been interested in Fraser Darling's studies on animal behaviour since the early 1940s, and the two had corresponded while Fraser Darling was living on Tanera Mor.\n\nHis 1969 BBC [[Reith Lectures]] (entitled ''Wilderness and Plenty''<ref name=\"Reith\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h3xk5|title=The Reith Lectures: Frank Fraser Darling: ''Wilderness and Plenty'': 1969|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref>) were an important contribution to the growing debate on man's responsibility for his [[natural environment]]. They were described at the time as \"an eloquent statement of the dependence of all living things on one another\".\n\nFraser Darling received an [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctorate]] from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 1971.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-graduates.htm|title=Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: Honorary Graduates|last=webperson@hw.ac.uk|website=www1.hw.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-07}}</ref>\n\nHe died in [[Forres]] in Morayshire in north-east Scotland in October 1979.<ref>https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf</ref>\n\n==Family==\n\nDarling married three times: firstly in 1922 to Marion Fraser (dissolved); secondly in 1948 to Averil Morley (d.1957); thirdly in 1960 to Christina MacInnes Brotchie.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n*1933\u20131936: Awarded [[Barnard Medal]]\n*1934: Elected Fellow, [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]\n*1936\u20131939: Appointed Carnegie Research Fellow\n*1947: Awarded [[Mungo Park Medal]], [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society]]\n*1970: Awarded Knighthood\n*1970\u20131973: Appointed member of the [[Royal Commission]] on Environmental Pollution\n*1972: Awarded Centenary Medal, [[National Park Service|US National Park Service]]\n*1973: Created Commandeur, [[Order of the Golden Ark]] ([[Netherlands]])\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n* 1932 \u2013 ''Colour Inheritance in Bull-terriers''.

It was an experimental weapon under advanced stages of development at that time. The name'''&nbsp;Kriss'''&nbsp;comes from a [[kris|Southeast Asian dagger]] with a flame-shaped blade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://modernfirearms.net/smg/usa/kriss-super-v-e.html|title=Modern Firearms - Kriss Super V|website=modernfirearms.net|language=en|access-date=2017-06-07}}</ref><ref>[[Future Weapons]], Season 2 episode 10, first broadcast March 17 2007</ref>\n\nThe second generation prototype of the Vector, called the '''K10''', was announced at 2011 [[SHOT Show]]. It is a slightly more compact version of the Vector that is based on the same Super V system. The main difference is a redesign of the lower receiver intended for easy caliber interchangeability; utilizing just a single takedown pin, users can change between 9x19mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP by mounting different lower receivers. This also brought a redesign of the charging handle, which now travels diagonally, almost vertically, and can be mounted on either side of the weapon. Other notable differences were a new telescoping stock instead of a folding one, and a four-sided accessory rail tube around the barrel. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensereview.com/kriss-k10-super-v-vector-xsmg-submachine-gun-smg-product-improvedupgraded-multi-caliber-subgun-for-special-operations-forces-sof-and-close-quarters-battle-cqb-applications-shot-show-2011-phot/|title=KRISS K10 Super V Vector XSMG Multi-Caliber Submachine Gun (SMG) and DEFIANCE Silencers/Sound Suppressors: Redesigned and Improved .45 ACP/9mm/.40 S&W Subgun for Special Operations Forces (SOF) and Close Quarters Battle (CQB) Applications (SHOT Show 2011 Photos!)|last=Crane|first=David|date=4 February 2011|publisher=DefenseReview.com|work=Featured, Personal Defense Weapons, Special Operations, Submachine Guns}}</ref> The K10 was not displayed after SHOT Show 2013 and its status is unknown and likely has been canceled.\n\nKriss announced \"Gen II\" versions of the original Vector models in 2015. These feature a redesigned pistol grip, trigger, safety selector, and compatibility with a new 9x19mm lower. These appear to have replaced the K10 prototypes, though no features from the K10 were carried over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/TDI_Vector|title=TDI Vector - Internet Movie Firearms Database - Guns in Movies, TV and Video Games|website=www.imfdb.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}</ref>\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Kriss Vector Right.JPG|thumb|A right-side view of a Vector CRB with the stock folded.|left]]The Vector uses an articulated mechanism referred to as the \"Kriss Super V,\" which allows the bolt and an inertia block to move downward into a recess behind the magazine well.<ref name=\"kriss-pressreleases\">{{cite web | url = http://www.kriss-usa.com/technology | title = Technology | publisher = KRISS Arms | accessdate = 26 November 2015 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130120033615/http://kriss-usa.com/technology | archivedate = 20 January 2013 }}</ref> The theory is that at the end of this travel, the energy is transmitted downward rather than rearward, thus reducing the felt recoil. When fired, the barrel axis is in line with the shoulder as in the [[M16 rifle]], but also in line with the shooter's hand. This is intended to reduce [[muzzle climb]] when combined with the off-axis bolt travel, though it also greatly raises the sight line in comparison to the bore axis. The initial prototype model by TDI achieved a rate of fire of 1,500 rounds per minute (RPM), though this was brought down to around 1,200 rounds per minute (RPM) on the production models.\n\nThe Vector is split into two major assemblies in a similar manner to the&nbsp;[[AR-15]]&nbsp;rifle, secured together with four push pins. Due to the weapon's unusual layout, the lower contains the action, charging handle, magazine well and barrel, while the upper contains the ejection port, rail system, pistol grip and fire control components, as well as the stock for configurations that have one. This modular design allows for toolless caliber conversions by swapping out only the lower.

It features a 5.5-inch barrel (with an option of a 6.5-inch barrel on the Gen II version), a folding stock, flip-up Midwest Industries back-up iron sights (BUIS) (MagPul MBUS on Gen II weapons), a full-length Picatinny rail for mounting various optics/scopes, and either two mode fire selector (single and full-auto) or a three mode fire selector (single, two-round burst and full-auto). It is only sold as a complete weapon in .45 ACP and 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, though due to the nature of the weapon the auto trigger pack is compatible with any Vector lower. The 9mm model uses [[Glock#9\u00d719mm Parabellum|Glock 17]]-compatible magazines (typically the extended 33-rounder used by the Glock 18) and the .45-caliber model uses Glock 21 magazines.   \n\nSemi-automatic versions are produced and available for the US civilian market. There are three main configurations, the Vector CRB, Vector SBR and Vector SDP. In addition to [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] and [[.45 ACP]], they can also be chambered in [[.40 S&W]] (using Glock 22 magazines), [[10mm Auto]] (using Glock 20 magazines), or [[.357 SIG]] (using Glock 31 magazines). A variant chambered for [[9\u00d721mm|9\u00d721mm IMI]] that feeds from standard 9\u00d719mm Glock 17 magazines is available for the Italian civilian market. The [[.22 Long Rifle|.22 LR]] variant feeds from a proprietary 10 round magazine, and functions using a traditional straight blowback operating system rather than the Super V delayed system. The Canadian (and some American) civil market versions only come with the blocked 10-round magazines rather than the full capacity magazines. Like the Law Enforcement / Military SMG models, the civilian model Vectors can be converted to chamber and fire other calibers if the lower receiver groups are changed. \n\n* The '''Vector CRB''' (carbine) is a semi-automatic carbine with a permanently affixed extension to the standard 5.5-inch barrel, extending it to {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}}, intended for states with short-barrel rifle bans, with an 18.6-inch (470 mm) version produced for the Canadian market. The standard model has a folding stock (fixed in states where state law prohibits). Variants exist for compliance with various state gun laws, including a California-legal \"featureless\" variant with a Kydex grip-wrap barrier (prohibits gripping the back of the pistol grip), a hand stop replacing the usual vertical foregrip, and a permanently affixed Defiance DS150 stock to give an overall length of 36.5-inch (930 mm).\n* The '''Vector SBR''' (''Short Barrel Rifle'') is a semi-automatic short-barreled configuration featuring the same 5.5-inch barrel as the selective fire submachine gun.\n* The '''Vector SDP''' (''Special Duty Pistol'') is a semi-automatic pistol configuration that has a permanently affixed cap with a sling mount in place of a folding stock. There is also a configuration of the Vector SDP fitted with an SB Tactical arm brace called the '''Vector SDP-SB''' (''Special Duty Pistol - Stabilizing Brace'').<ref>https://kriss-usa.com/pistols/stabilizing-brace/vector-sdp-sb-black</ref>\nThe \"Enhanced\" versions of the Gen II CRB and SBR are also available with collapsing M4-style stock adaptors instead of the standard folding stock (with a [[Magpul]] UBR stock included) and a rectangular [[barrel shroud]] for the CRB, though these accessories can also be purchased separately.\n\n== Derivatives ==\nKriss announced development of a semi-automatic pistol called the \"[[Kard]]\" in 2010, using the Super V system in a much smaller package to minimize recoil and muzzle rise in 9\u00d719mm Parabellum and .45 ACP calibers.

It is a slightly more compact version of the Vector that is based on the same Super V system. The main difference is a redesign of the lower receiver intended for easy caliber interchangeability; utilizing just a single takedown pin, users can change between 9x19mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP by mounting different lower receivers. This also brought a redesign of the charging handle, which now travels diagonally, almost vertically, and can be mounted on either side of the weapon. Other notable differences were a new telescoping stock instead of a folding one, and a four-sided accessory rail tube around the barrel. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensereview.com/kriss-k10-super-v-vector-xsmg-submachine-gun-smg-product-improvedupgraded-multi-caliber-subgun-for-special-operations-forces-sof-and-close-quarters-battle-cqb-applications-shot-show-2011-phot/|title=KRISS K10 Super V Vector XSMG Multi-Caliber Submachine Gun (SMG) and DEFIANCE Silencers/Sound Suppressors: Redesigned and Improved .45 ACP/9mm/.40 S&W Subgun for Special Operations Forces (SOF) and Close Quarters Battle (CQB) Applications (SHOT Show 2011 Photos!)|last=Crane|first=David|date=4 February 2011|publisher=DefenseReview.com|work=Featured, Personal Defense Weapons, Special Operations, Submachine Guns}}</ref> The K10 was not displayed after SHOT Show 2013 and its status is unknown and likely has been canceled.\n\nKriss announced \"Gen II\" versions of the original Vector models in 2015. These feature a redesigned pistol grip, trigger, safety selector, and compatibility with a new 9x19mm lower. These appear to have replaced the K10 prototypes, though no features from the K10 were carried over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/TDI_Vector|title=TDI Vector - Internet Movie Firearms Database - Guns in Movies, TV and Video Games|website=www.imfdb.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}</ref>\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Kriss Vector Right.JPG|thumb|A right-side view of a Vector CRB with the stock folded.|left]]The Vector uses an articulated mechanism referred to as the \"Kriss Super V,\" which allows the bolt and an inertia block to move downward into a recess behind the magazine well.<ref name=\"kriss-pressreleases\">{{cite web | url = http://www.kriss-usa.com/technology | title = Technology | publisher = KRISS Arms | accessdate = 26 November 2015 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130120033615/http://kriss-usa.com/technology | archivedate = 20 January 2013 }}</ref> The theory is that at the end of this travel, the energy is transmitted downward rather than rearward, thus reducing the felt recoil. When fired, the barrel axis is in line with the shoulder as in the [[M16 rifle]], but also in line with the shooter's hand. This is intended to reduce [[muzzle climb]] when combined with the off-axis bolt travel, though it also greatly raises the sight line in comparison to the bore axis. The initial prototype model by TDI achieved a rate of fire of 1,500 rounds per minute (RPM), though this was brought down to around 1,200 rounds per minute (RPM) on the production models.\n\nThe Vector is split into two major assemblies in a similar manner to the&nbsp;[[AR-15]]&nbsp;rifle, secured together with four push pins. Due to the weapon's unusual layout, the lower contains the action, charging handle, magazine well and barrel, while the upper contains the ejection port, rail system, pistol grip and fire control components, as well as the stock for configurations that have one. This modular design allows for toolless caliber conversions by swapping out only the lower. The Vector's safety is ambidextrous (as well as the fire mode selector on the auto trigger pack) while the ejection port, charging handle, bolt release catch and magazine release are not, and are only available in a right-handed configuration.\n\nCalibers such as [[.22 LR]], [[.40 S&W]] and [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] were mentioned when the gun was first released.

He is also regarded as a significant figure in the history of [[cassette culture]] and [[DIY music]]. His most popular work is ''[[The Greatest Living Englishman]]'' (1993), produced by [[Andy Partridge]] of [[XTC]].\n\n==Musical career==\n\n===1973\u20131979===\nIn the summer of 1973, a 20-year-old Newell joined [[Colchester]] [[glam rock]] [[cover band]] '''Plod''' as their lead singer, replacing founder member [[Steve Travis|Steve Greenfield]]. Plod was signed to London-based indie label Banjul Records in early 1975, and quickly began recording tracks for an album. However, contractual irregularities and financial problems at the label prevented the album from being finished or released,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} and the band broke up within a few months of being signed. In 2003, one track from the sessions (\"Neo City\") was released on a 70s glam-rock compilation CD titled ''[[Velvet Tinmine]]''. This track was credited to ''The'' Plod, and remains the only officially issued work by the band.\n\nNewell then joined '''Gypp''', a pop-oriented progressive rock band, as lead singer. Gypp also played abroad and became popular in Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia area thanks to their live performances. Gypp issued one 3-song 7-inch EP in 1978, but their music was out of step with the punk-oriented trends of the UK music scene at the time and the EP received a negative review in the ''[[New Musical Express]].''  Demoralised, Newell left the band. By his own account, he then became a \"musical recluse\", staying in the studio and creating new songs but not playing live gigs for many years.\n\n===1979\u20131992===\nIn the late seventies, Newell led a four-piece rock combo called '''The Stray Trolleys'''. They recorded material in 1979 and 1980, but it was not released until after the band had broken up.\n\nIn the meantime, Newell issued his first solo single (\"Young Jobless\" b/w \"Sylvie in Toytown\") on vinyl in 1980. By the end of 1980, he was collaborating with Lawrence \"Lol\" Elliot as '''The Cleaners from Venus''', a band that mostly released their work on cassettes outside the traditional music distribution channels.\n\nBy 1983, The Cleaners from Venus had evolved into a band with a floating line-up that featured Newell as its only constant. The band still primarily issued material on cassette, got signed to the West German independent label Modell Records for one vinyl album (''Under Wartime Conditions'') and ultimately to the German leg of [[RCA]] Records which released two albums (''Going to England'', ''Town and Country'').\n\n[[Giles Smith]] joined Newell as the only other official member of Cleaners From Venus between 1986 and 1988, and in 1987, Newell returned to performing live under The Cleaners of<!-- Is \"of\" deliberate here, or just a typo for \"from\"? --> Venus banner. As well, while regularly releasing Cleaners From Venus material on cassette, through the 1980s Newell also occasionally released cassette singles and albums under his own name. On these solo releases he was usually the only musician.\n\nIn spring 1988 Newell and Nelson (Peter Nice) formed the [[Musical_ensemble#Two_parts|duo]] '''The Brotherhood of Lizards''', self-releasing the [[Mini-LP|mini-album]] ''The Brotherhood of Lizards'' that same year, followed by the album ''Lizardland'' released on [[Independent record label|independent label]] Deltic Records in 1989.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Newell |first1=Martin |title=Lizard Tails -- Martin Looks Back |url=http://www.stevedix.de/newell/overview.html |website=Martin Newell's website |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref> To support the album the duo embarked on a [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] promotional tour, cycling over 1000 miles across southern England between October 1989 and February 1990 to make local radio appearances and and do local newspaper interviews, while also [[Street performance|busking]] and performing gigs. The uniqueness of this \"green tour\" caught the attention of the [[Media of the United Kingdom|mainstream media]] with the duo making half a dozen televison appearances, and interviews with them appeared in the [[NME]], [[Melody Maker]], [[The Guardian]], [[The Independent]], [[The Mail on Sunday]] and [[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]].

His first non-cassette solo album, ''[[The Greatest Living Englishman]]'', was produced by [[XTC]]'s [[Andy Partridge]], and was a critical success.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Commercially, it remains his most popular and successful album.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  It was followed by three more albums (''The Off White Album'', produced by [[Louis Philippe (musician)|Louis Philippe]], ''The Spirit Cage'' and ''Radio Autumn Attic'') and an EP (''Songs from the Station Hotel'') that continued to explore the same subject matter as ''Englishman'', including the charms of rural or small-town English life and portraits of characters and scenes.\n\nNewell has also made live appearances with The Cleaners from Venus and The Stray Trolleys in the 1990s and beyond, and has issued several post-1993 live recordings with these bands. However, studio releases credited to these groups post-1993 are actually all CD reissues of pre-1993 material previously released only on cassette. In addition, Gypp played reunion gigs in 1996, and live Gypp material \u2013 as well as Gypp demos recorded in the late 1970s \u2013 have now been officially issued on CD.\n\nIn 2004 Newell released an album of light jazz songs, ''The Light Programme''. The album was not particularly successful commercially but his next album ''A Summer Tamarind'' returned to his usual style and was much more warmly received.\n\nIn late 2005 the British singer [[Richard Shelton (actor)|Richard Shelton]] released a jazz vocal album called ''Top Cat'' with five Newell compositions. Newell's songs have also been recorded by Miki Huber, The Jennifers, Kerry Getz, [[R. Stevie Moore]] and [[Alphaville (group)|Alphaville]].\n\n==Literary career==\nNewell is better known to some as a poet and author; he has released several volumes of poetry (often in collaboration with the illustrator [[James Dodds]]) and a memoir, ''This Little Ziggy'', about his youth and his days in Plod. In 2007 he released a volume of reminiscences, anecdotes and historical information about his beloved Wivenhoe. He is also a weekly contributor of poetry to ''[[The Sunday Express]],'' He now writes a weekly column for the East Anglian Daily Times (for which he won columnist of the year in the EDF/ East of England Media Awards in January 2010), performs annually at the [[Essex Book Festival]] and occasionally  issues spoken word recordings of his poems.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Martin Newell discography}}\n\n'''Studio albums'''\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n*''Barricades and Angels'' (1980)\n*''Blow Away Your Troubles'' (1981)\n*''On Any Normal Monday'' (1982)\n*''Midnight Cleaners'' (1982)\n*''In the Golden Autumn'' (1983)\n*''[[Under Wartime Conditions]]'' (1984)\n*''Songs for a Fallow Land'' (1985)\n*''Living with Victoria Grey'' (1986)\n*''Going to England'' (1987)\n*''Town & Country'' (1988)\n*''The Brotherhood of Lizards'' (1988)\n*''Lizardland'' (1989)\n*''Number Thirteen'' (1990)\n*''[[The Greatest Living Englishman]]'' (1993)\n*''The Off White Album'' (1995)\n*''The Spirit Cage'' (2000)\n*''Radio Autumn Attic'' (2002)\n*''The Light Programme'' (2004)\n*''A Summer Tamarind'' (2007)\n*''English Electric'' (2011)\n*''In Chimp World'' (2011)\n*''The Late District'' (2013)\n*''Return to Bohemia'' (2014)\n*''Rose of the Lanes'' (2015)\n*''The Last Boy in the Locarno'' (2016)\n*''Star Cafe'' (2018)\n*''Life in a Time Machine'' (2018)\n*''Dolly Birds & Spies'' (2020)\n}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{main|Martin Newell bibliography}}\n\n'''Publications'''\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*''I Hank Marvinned...''

It aired on television in the United States and Canada on February 13, 2009. The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,556. This episode contains the first use of the term \"The Colony.\"\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode follows stories on two timelines: the current events in the Colonial fleet, and events aboard [[John Cavil|Cavil]] and [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Boomer's]] basestar in flashback, beginning at the end of the [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylon]] occupation of [[New Caprica]], and jumping forward until it converges with the present.\n\nIn a flashback to the Cylon occupation of New Caprica, it is revealed that [[Ellen Tigh]] resurrected in the Cylon fleet after Saul poisoned her. Her resurrection restores all of Ellen's true memories. At first, she is known only to Cavil. Ellen tries to persuade Cavil to stop chasing the humans, but he refuses, saying he wants justice for the enslavement of the Cylons that led to the First Cylon War. Ellen refers to Cavil as John, his model's original name, which he dislikes. It is revealed that he was modeled after Ellen's father.\n\nOn board the ''Galactica'', [[Galen Tyrol|Tyrol]] shows [[William Adama|Admiral Adama]] the damage to the ship's hull he discovered at the end of the previous episode (see \"[[Blood on the Scales]]\"), and warns that the ship may not survive another jump without repair. Tyrol indicates that when ''Galactica'' was built, corners were cut, compromising its structural integrity. Also, the ship has taken accumulated battle damage as well as the jump into New Caprica's atmosphere which strained the ship's structural integrity. Adama reinstates [[Galen Tyrol|Tyrol]] to the rank of Chief, and asks him to fix the ship, insisting on the repair crew being all human. Repair efforts begin, but by [[Fluorescent penetrant inspection|performing a special type of inspection]], Tyrol discovers extensive micro fractures throughout the bulkheads that cannot be easily repaired, and recommends an organic Cylon compound, which Adama adamantly refuses.\n\nAs a side-effect of the bullet still lodged in his brain, [[Samuel Anders]] is able to recover memories of the complete origin and purpose of the [[Final Five Cylons|Final Five]]. Three others of the Final Five and [[Kara Thrace]] gather around his bedside, begging for him to be kept out of surgery until he can finish explaining. Anders says that the Cylons, which were the thirteenth tribe of [[Kobol]], began procreating naturally on Earth and finally lost resurrection technology. Anders and the other Final Five were researchers who worked on reinventing the ancient technology.\n\nOn ''Colonial One'', [[Lee Adama]] proposes assembling a new Quorum. He says it should reflect the current times, representing the ships in the fleet rather than the old 12 colonies. [[Laura Roslin]] agrees, and tells him to assemble the new Quorum himself. She says she will remain as president in title, with Lee assuming the responsibilities of the office. She says her only reservation about him is that he sometimes does what is right, rather than what is smart.\n\nIn the infirmary, Sam continues his explanation. The Final Five re-developed the ancient resurrection process, and created a resurrection ship in orbit around Earth. When nuclear war destroyed the Earth Colony, the Final Five were killed but resurrected on the ship. They made their way to the [[Twelve Colonies]] with the intention of warning the humans against repeating old mistakes and provoking another war with Centurions. They lacked [[faster-than-light]] technology, so they traveled at speeds near, but below, the speed of light. In accordance with [[Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], due to [[time dilation]] only a short time passed for them, while thousands of years passed for the rest of the universe. They arrived only to find that the other Colonies were already engulfed in war with their own Cylon Centurions.\n\nThe Centurions had already created the hybrid models, but nothing that could survive on its own. The Five offered to help the Centurions if, in exchange, they ended the war. The Five gave them resurrection technology and created eight humanoid models, although the fleet previously only knew of the existence of seven of them. Kara asks Sam about the eighth Cylon, designated [[Number Seven (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Seven]], thinking it might be her, but Sam tells her that it was a male named Daniel.\n\nIn another flashback, Ellen tells Cavil that she knows he killed all the Daniels, because Cavil was jealous of them. Cavil responded that the Daniels \"didn't thrive.\"\n\nCavil shows her images of the temple on the algae planet. Ellen says the temple wasn't her invention. It was created by the thirteenth tribe on their way from Kobol to Earth. Cavil mentions that D'Anna saw the faces of the Five in that temple, and Ellen says that was not because of anything she did. She suggested it was an act of the \"One God.\"\n\nCavil is resentful that the Five gave him human weaknesses. Ellen realizes that he sent the Five to live among the humans because he wanted them to suffer. Boomer asks Ellen if she feels remorse for what she did for the Cylons. She replies that she does not, because what she did was a good thing. She gave them free will and the ability to feel compassion.\n\nSam's doctors insist that the surgery cannot wait anymore, and they start the surgery before he's finished explaining everything. As he is being wheeled into the operating theater, he urges [[Saul Tigh]] to stay with the fleet.\n\nIn yet another flashback, Cavil informs Ellen about the destruction of the Resurrection Hub by the humans and the rebel Cylons and tells her that she will have to recreate the resurrection technology for them. She claims that she will need the other Final Five in order to do this, however Cavil does not believe her. He tells her that if she doesn't give him the information, he'll extract the information from her brain using a psychophysical process.\n\nIn a flashback to two days ago, Boomer comes to Ellen, supposedly to escort her to the surgery. Ellen tells her that she should have brought a [[tumbrel#Tumbrels (other definitions)|tumbrel]] (a cart used to transport condemned prisoners during the French revolution), implying that Cavil's procedure is some form of punishment or execution. Boomer leads Ellen to a captured Raptor, saying she is forgiving her. They escape the basestar and then [[Jump drive|jump]] away.\n\nSam comes out of surgery and Starbuck tries to talk to him, but paramedic [[List of minor characters in Battlestar Galactica (reimagining)#Ishay, Layne|Ishay]] points out on the monitor that he has almost no brain function.\n\nIn his room, Adama notices large cracks in the bulkheads, and finally relents, calling Tyrol and telling him to do whatever it takes to save the ship, presumably including the Cylon-based biological structural reinforcements.\n\n==Ratings==\n\"No Exit\" was seen by 1.738 million viewers (live viewing plus same day [[digital video recorder]] viewing).<ref>[http://tvbythenumbers.com/2009/02/18/nba-all-star-festivities-the-closer-wwe-raw-and-monk-lead-week-damages-to-return-despite-ratings/13021#more-13021 Seidman, Robert. \"Updated: NBA All-Star festivities, The Closer, WWE RAW, and Monk lead week, Damages to Return Despite Ratings.\" TVBytheNumbers.com.
