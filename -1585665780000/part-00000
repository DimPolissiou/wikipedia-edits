It is usually divided into two historical periods \u2013 the Early L\u00ea dynasty (1428\u20131527) in which emperors ruled in their own right, and the [[Revival L\u00ea dynasty|Restored L\u00ea dynasty]] (1533\u20131789), in which figurehead emperors reigned under the auspices of the powerful [[Tr\u1ecbnh lords|Tr\u1ecbnh family]]. \n\nThe dynasty officially began in 1428 with the [[enthronement]] of [[L\u00ea L\u1ee3i]] after he drove the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] army from Vietnam. In 1527, the [[M\u1ea1c dynasty]] usurped the throne; when the L\u00ea dynasty was restored in 1533, the M\u1ea1c fled to the far north and continued to claim the throne during the period known as [[Southern and Northern Dynasties of Vietnam|Southern and Northern Dynasties]]. The restored L\u00ea emperors held no real power, and by the time the M\u1ea1c dynasty was finally eradicated in 1677, actual power lay in the hands of the [[Tr\u1ecbnh lords]] in the North and [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords]] in the South, both ruling in the name of the L\u00ea emperor while [[Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n War|fighting each other]]. The L\u00ea dynasty officially ended in 1789, when the peasant uprising of the [[T\u00e2y S\u01a1n]] brothers defeated both the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n, ironically in order to restore power to the L\u00ea dynasty.\n\nThe L\u00ea dynasty expanded Vietnam's borders through the [[Cham\u2013Vietnamese War (1471)|domination of the Kingdom of Champa]] nearly reaching its current size the time the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n brothers took over. It also saw massive changes to Vietnamese society: the previously Buddhist state became [[Confucianism|Confucian]] after 20 years of Ming rule. The L\u00ea emperors instituted many changes modeled after the Chinese system, including the [[civil service]] and laws. Their long-lasting rule was attributed to the popularity of the early emperors. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's liberation of the country from 20 years of Ming rule and [[L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng]]'s bringing the country into a golden age was well-remembered by the people. Even though the restored L\u00ea emperors' rule was marked by civil strife and constant peasant uprisings, few dared to openly challenge their power, at least in name, for fear of losing popular support. \n\n== History ==\n{{main|Lam S\u01a1n uprising}}\n=== Early L\u00ea (1428\u20131527) ===\n==== L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 and Founding of the L\u00ea dynasty ====\n{{main|L\u00ea L\u1ee3i}}\n[[File:Dien Kinh Thien 001.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Hall of K\u00ednh Thi\u00ean (\u656c\u5929\u6bbf), where L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was proclaimed emperor.

In 1400, [[H\u1ed3 Qu\u00fd Ly]] overthrew the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty before establishing the short-lived [[H\u1ed3 dynasty]], renaming the country from \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t to [[\u0110\u1ea1i Ngu]]. In 1407, the Ming Empire under the [[Yongle Emperor]] [[Ming\u2013H\u1ed3 War|conquered]] the H\u1ed3 dynasty, starting the [[Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam|Ming domination]] of Vietnam. \n\nIn 1418 L\u00ea L\u1ee3i [[Lam S\u01a1n uprising|rose in revolt]] against Ming rule. After ten years of warfare the Ming were driven from Vietnam in 1428. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i proclaimed himself Emperor of [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]], posthumously known by his [[temple name]] L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 (\u9ece\u592a\u7956, L\u00ea the Founding Emperor), and was recognized by the [[Xuande Emperor]] of Ming.

He had many wives, and he discarded one favorite after another. The most prominent scandal was his affair with Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u1ed9, the wife of his father's chief advisor Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i. The affair started early in 1442 and continued when the Emperor traveled to the home of Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i, who was venerated as a great Confucian scholar.\n\nShortly after the Emperor left Tr\u00e3i's home to continue his tour of the western province, he fell ill and died. At the time the powerful nobles in the court argued that the Emperor had been poisoned to death. Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i was [[Nine familial exterminations#Punishment|executed as were his three entire relations]], the normal punishment for treason at that time.\n\n==== L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng (ruled 1442\u20131459) ====\n{{main|L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng}}\nWith the Emperor's sudden death at a young age, his infant heir Bang Co was made emperor- although he was the second son of his father, his older brother Nghi D\u00e2n had been officially passed over due to his mother's low social status. Bang Co assumed the throne as [[L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng]] (\u9ece\u4ec1\u5b97) <ref name=CK/> but the real rulers were [[Tr\u1ecbnh Kh\u1ea3]] and the child's mother, the young Empress [[Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Anh]]. The next 17 years were good years for Vietnam \u2013 there were no great troubles either internally or externally. Two things of note occurred: first, the Vietnamese sent an army south to attack the [[Champa|Champa kingdom]] in 1446; second, the Dowager Empress ordered the execution of Tr\u1ecbnh Kh\u1ea3, for reasons lost to history, in 1451.\n\nIn 1453 at the age of twelve, L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng was formally given the title of Emperor. This was unusual as according to custom, youths could not ascend the throne till the age of 16. It may have been done to remove Nguy\u1ec5n Thi Anh from power, but if that was the reason, it failed and the Dowager Empress still controlled the government up until a coup in 1459.\n\nIn 1459, L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng's older brother, Nghi D\u00e2n, plotted with a group of followers to kill the Emperor. On October 28, the plotters with some 100 \"shiftless men\" infiltrated the palace and murdered the Emperor (he was just 18). The next day, facing certain execution the Dowager Empress committed suicide. The rule of Nghi D\u00e2n was brief, and he was never officially recognized as a sovereign by later Vietnamese historians. Revolts against his rule started almost immediately and the second revolt, occurring on June 24, 1460, succeeded.

His rule, '''H\u1ed3ng \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecbnh Th\u1ebf''' or ''Prospered reign'' of H\u1ed3ng \u0110\u1ee9c (\u6d2a\u5fb7\u4e4b\u76db\u6cbb) (\u6d2a\u5fb7, meaning \"Flood of Virtue\") was one of the most notable and prosperity in Vietnamese history. He instituted a wide range of government reforms, legal reforms, and land reforms. He restarted the examination system for selecting men for important government positions. He reduced the power of the noble families and reduced the degree of corruption in the government. He built temples to Confucius throughout the provinces of [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]]. In nearly all respects, his reforms mirrored those of the [[Ming dynasty]].\nTh\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng was strongly influenced by his Confucian teachers and he resolved to make [[Name of Vietnam|Vi\u1ec7t Nam]] more like the [[Ming Dynasty]] with its [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucianist]] philosophy and the key idea that the government should be run by men of noble character as opposed to men from noble families. This meant that he needed to take power away from the ruling families (mostly from [[Thanh H\u00f3a Province|Thanh H\u00f3a province]]) and give power to the scholars who did well on the official examinations. The first step on this path was to revive the examination process, which had continued sporadically in the 1450s. The first examination was held in 1463 and, as expected, the top scholars were men from elsewhere- usually from the river delta surrounding the capital, not from [[Thanh H\u00f3a]].\n\nTh\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng encouraged the spread of Confucian values throughout Vietnam by having \"[[Temple of Confucius|temples of literature]]\" built in all the provinces. There, Confucius was venerated and classic works on Confucianism could be found. He also halted the building of any new Buddhist or Taoist temples and ordered that monks were not to be allowed to purchase any new land.\n\nFollowing the Chinese model, L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng divided the government into six ministries; they were Finance, Rites, Justice, Personnel, Army, and Public Works. Nine grades of rank were set up for both the civil administration and the military. A Board of Censors was set up with royal authority to monitor governmental officials and reported exclusively to the emperor. However, governmental authority did not extend all the way to the village level. The villages were ruled by their own councils in Vietnam (''Vietnam, Trials and Tribulations of a Nation'' D. R. SarDesai, ppg 35\u201337, 1988).\n\nWith the death of [[Nguy\u1ec5n X\u00fd]]  in 1465, the noble families from Thanh H\u00f3a province lost their leader. Soon they were mostly relegated to secondary positions in the new Confucian government of Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng. However, they still retained control over Vietnam's armies as the old general, \u0110inh Li\u1ec7t, was still in command of the army.\n\nIn 1465, Vietnam was attacked by [[Ryukyuan]] pirates from the northeast. This was dealt with by sending additional forces to the north to fight the pirates. Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng also sent a military force to the west to subdue the Ai-lao mountain tribes that was raiding the northwest border.\n\nIn 1469, all of Vietnam was mapped and a full census was taken, listing all the villages in the Empire. Around this time the country was divided into 13 dao (provinces). Each was administrated by a Governor, Judge, and the local army commander. The emperor Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng also ordered that a new census should be taken every six years. Other public works that were undertaken included building and repair of granaries, using the army to rebuild and repair irrigation systems after floods, and sending out doctors to areas afflicted by outbreaks of disease. Even though the emperor, at 25, was relatively young, he had already restored Vietnam's stability, which was a marked contrast from the turbulent times marking the reigns of the two emperors before him.\n\nThe centralized government proved to be effective and represented a successful adaptation of the Chinese Confucian system of government outside of China.\n\nL\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng was aggressive in his relations with foreign countries including China and Malacca and cracked down on foreign trade and contacts, enforcing an isolationist policy.\n[[File:B\u1ea3n \u0111\u1ed3 Th\u1eeba Tuy\u00ean Thu\u1eadn H\u00f3a trong b\u1ed9 H\u1ed3ng \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3n \u0110\u1ed3.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Map of [[Thu\u1eadn H\u00f3a]] and [[Qu\u1ea3ng Nam]] region drew by Emperor H\u1ed3ng \u0110\u1ee9c in 1489.]]\n\nSeveral Malay envoys from the [[Malacca sultanate]] were attacked and captured in 1469 by Vietnamese navy as they were returning to Malacca from China.

He was 38 years old at the time of his father's death. He was an affable, meek and mild-mannered person. Due to his short period of rule and that he didn't pass many significant reforms, his reign is considered to be an extension of L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng's rule. The new emperor was known to historical annals as [[L\u00ea Hi\u1ebfn T\u00f4ng]]. In early 1499, several high-ranking officials including L\u00ea V\u0129nh and L\u00ea N\u0103ng Nh\u01b0\u1ee3ng persuaded Hi\u1ebfn T\u00f4ng to choose an heir in order to maintain the dynasty's and the nation's security and sustainability.

L\u00ea Uy M\u1ee5c was described by a Ming ambassador \u2013 as a cruel, sadistic, and depraved person, who wasted the court's money and finances to indulge his whims. Well aware that he was detested by his subjects, L\u00ea Uy M\u1ee5c protected himself by hiring a group of elite bodyguards to surround him at all times. Among them was [[M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung]], who became very close to the emperor and eventually rose to the rank of general. Despite his precautions, in 1509 a cousin, whom L\u00ea Uy M\u1ee5c had put in prison, escaped and plotted with court insiders to assassinate the emperor.

He reigned from 1510 to 1516, all the while spending down the royal treasury, and doing nothing to improve the country.  He was heedless to the reaction that his taxes caused throughout the country.

Soon after L\u00ea Chi\u00eau T\u00f4ng fled south with the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n in 1522, M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung proclaimed the Emperor's younger brother, L\u00ea Xu\u00e2n, as the new Emperor under the name [[L\u00ea Cung Ho\u00e0ng]]. In reality, the new Emperor had no power. Three years after M\u1ea1c's forces killed his older brother L\u00ea Chi\u00eau T\u00f4ng, was pressured from M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung, in B\u1eafc S\u1ee9 garden, L\u00ea Cung Ho\u00e0ng hanged himself in 18 June 1527. [[M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung]], being a scholar-official who had effectively controlled the L\u00ea for a decade, murdered all the L\u00ea royal family member then proclaimed himself the new Emperor of Vietnam in 15 June 1527, ending (so he thought) the L\u00ea dynasty (see [[M\u1ea1c dynasty]] for more details).\n\nM\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung's seizure of the throne prompted other families of the aristocracy, notably the Nguy\u1ec5n and Tr\u1ecbnh, to rush to the support of the L\u00ea royalists. With the usurpation of the throne, the civil war broke out anew. Again the Nguy\u1ec5n and the Tr\u1ecbnh gathered an army and fought against M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung, this time under the leadership of [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kim]] and [[Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m]]. The Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n were nominally fighting on behalf of the L\u00ea emperor but in reality, for their own power.\n\n=== Restored L\u00ea (1533\u20131789)===\n==== Southern and Northern Dynasties ====\n{{main|Southern and Northern Dynasties (Vietnam){{!}}Southern and Northern Dynasties|L\u00ea\u2013M\u1ea1c War}}\n[[File:Map_of_Southern_and_Northern_Dynasties_of_Vietnam.png|thumb|180px|Map of Vietnam showing the M\u1ea1c in control of the north and central part of Vietnam while the L\u00ea-Nguy\u1ec5n-Tr\u1ecbnh alliance controls the south.]]\n[[File:Breech mug.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Vietnamese cannons during sixteenth century, displayed in Museum of Vietnam.]]\n[[File:Lord Tr\u1ecbnh S\u00e2m and Lady \u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u1ecb Hu\u1ec7 having a tea party at T\u1ea3 V\u1ecdng House.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Tr\u1ecbnh lord having a tea party at T\u1ea3 V\u1ecdng house]]\nThe L\u00ea royalists under L\u00ea Ninh, a descendant of the Royal family, escaped to [[Muang Phuan]] (today [[Laos]]).

The power of royal court was then passed to Nguy\u1ec5n Kim's son-in-law [[Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m]] who became the founder of the [[Tr\u1ecbnh lords]]. Since then the emperor has only become a figurehead, Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m and his succesors were the ''[[de facto]]'' rulers of the country and continue the war with the M\u1ea1c. Unable to resist the forces of the L\u00ea royalists, the M\u1ea1c dynasty retreated to the north and established a new capital at [[Cao B\u1eb1ng Province]] allying with the [[Ming dynasty]] of [[China]] as a tributary nation against the L\u00ea dynasty. However, the Ming dynasty still recognized and the legitimates of the L\u00ea dynasty.\n\nLater, the first son of Nguy\u1ec5n Kim, ([[Nguy\u1ec5n Uong]]) was assassinated by Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m. Nguy\u1ec5n Kim's second son, [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng]], relocated to the south, became the Viceroy of [[Thu\u1eadn Ho\u00e1]] province, founded the line of [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords]], and started a revolt against the reign of the Tr\u1ecbnh lords. As such, \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t was divided for 232 years as the two lords fought each other in what is now known as the [[Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n War|Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil War]].\n\n==== Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n contention ====\n{{main|Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n War|Tr\u1ecbnh lords|Nguy\u1ec5n lords}}\n[[File:The King of Tunquin's Funeral preparation by Jean-Baptiste Tavernier (Part A).jpg|180px|thumb|left|A street in \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh during seventeenth century]]\n[[File:Vietnam1650.GIF|180px|thumb|left|Partition of Vietnam in 1650s, amid the Tr\u1ecbnh-Nguy\u1ec5n war]]\nIn 1620, Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Nguy\u00ean officially refused to send taxes to the court in Hanoi. A formal demand was made to the Nguy\u1ec5n to submit to the authority of the court, and it was formally refused. In 1623 Tr\u1ecbnh T\u00f9ng died and was succeeded by his son [[Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng]]. Now Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng made a formal demand for submission, and again Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Nguy\u00ean refused. Finally in 1627 open warfare broke out between the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n. For four months a large Tr\u1ecbnh army battled against the Nguy\u1ec5n army but were unable to defeat them. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The result of this war was that Vietnam had effectively been partitioned into [[Northern and southern Vietnam|northern and southern]] regions, with the Tr\u1ecbnh controlling most of the north and the Nguy\u1ec5n controlling most of the south; the dividing line was the [[Gianh River]] in [[Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province]]. This border was very close to the [[17th parallel north|Seventeenth parallel]] (in actuality the [[B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River]] located just to the south in [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province]]), which was imposed as the border between [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Partition of Vietnam]] (1954\u201375). {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nWhile the Tr\u1ecbnh ruled over a much more populous territory, the Nguy\u1ec5n had several advantages. First, they were on the defensive. Second, the Nguy\u1ec5n were able to take advantage of their contacts with the Europeans, specifically the Portuguese, to purchase advanced European weapons and hire European military experts in fortifications. Third, the geography was favorable to them, as the flat land suitable for large organized armies is very narrow at this point of Vietnam; the mountains nearly reach to the sea.<ref name=Dupuy>Dupuy, p. 653.</ref>\n\nAfter the first assault, the Nguy\u1ec5n built two massive fortified lines which stretched a few miles from the sea to the hills. The walls were built north of [[Hu\u1ebf]] near the city of [[\u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi]]. The Nguy\u1ec5n defended these lines against numerous Tr\u1ecbnh offensives which lasted till 1672.<ref name=Dupuy/> The story from this time is that the great military engineer was a Vietnamese general who was hired away from the Tr\u1ecbnh court by the Nguy\u1ec5n. This man is given the credit in Vietnam for the successful design of the Nguy\u1ec5n walls. Against the walls the Tr\u1ecbnh mustered an army of 100,000 men, 500 elephants, and 500 large ships (Dupuy \"Encyclopedia of Military History\" pg. 596). The initial attacks on the Nguy\u1ec5n wall was unsuccessful. The attacks lasted for several years.\n\n[[Image:VN rifles.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Upper:Goa style arquebuses \u2013 Probably were widespread in Vietnam during the 17th century]]\nIn 1633 the Tr\u1ecbnh tried an amphibious assault on the Nguy\u1ec5n to get around the wall. The Tr\u1ecbnh fleet was defeated by the Nguy\u1ec5n fleet at the battle of Nhat-Le.<ref name=Dupuy/> Around 1635 the Tr\u1ecbnh copied the Nguy\u1ec5n and sought military aid from the Europeans. Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng hired the [[VOC]] to make cannons and ships for the Royal army. In 1642\u201343, the Tr\u1ecbnh army attacked the Nguy\u1ec5n walls. With the aid of the Dutch cannons, the Tr\u1ecbnh army broke through the first wall but failed to break through the second. At sea, the Tr\u1ecbnh, with their Dutch ships ''[[Kievit]]'', ''Nachtegaels'' and ''[[Woekende Book]]'' were destroyed in a humiliating defeat by the Nguy\u1ec5n fleet with their Chinese style galleys.<ref>Reid p. 230.</ref><ref>Hoang, p. 83.</ref><ref>Wiest, p. 23.</ref><ref>Li, p. 96.</ref><ref>Weiss, p. 176.</ref> Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng staged yet another offensive in 1648 but at the battle of Truong Duc, the Royal army was badly beaten by the Nguy\u1ec5n.<ref name=Dupuy/> The new L\u00ea king died around this time, perhaps as a result of the defeat. This now left the door open for the Nguy\u1ec5n to finally go on the offensive.\n\nThe Nguy\u1ec5n launched their own invasion of northern Vietnam in 1653. The Nguy\u1ec5n army attacked north and defeated the weakened Royal army. [[Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province]] was captured. Then [[H\u00e0 T\u0129nh Province]] fell to the Nguy\u1ec5n army. In the following year, Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng died as Nguy\u1ec5n forces made attacks into [[Ngh\u1ec7 An Province]]. Under a new Tr\u1ecbnh Lord, the capable [[Tr\u1ecbnh T\u1ea1c]], the Royal army attacked the Nguy\u1ec5n army and defeated it. The Nguy\u1ec5n were fatally weakened by a division between their two top generals who refused to cooperate with each other. In 1656 the Nguy\u1ec5n army was driven back all the way to their original walls. Tr\u1ecbnh T\u1ea1c tried to break the walls of the Nguy\u1ec5n in 1661 but this attack, like so many before it, failed to break through the walls.\n\nIn 1672, the Tr\u1ecbnh army made a last effort to conquer the Nguy\u1ec5n. The attacking army was under the command of Tr\u1ecbnh T\u1ea1c's son, [[Tr\u1ecbnh C\u0103n]], while the defending army was under the command of [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac T\u1ea7n]]'s son Prince [[:vi:T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Hi\u1ec7p (t\u01b0\u1edbng ch\u00faa Nguy\u1ec5n)|Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Thu\u1eadn]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The attack, like all the previous attacks on the Nguy\u1ec5n walls, failed. This time the two sides agreed to a peace. With mediation supplied by the government of the [[Kangxi Emperor]], the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n finally agreed to end the fighting by making the [[Linh River]] the border between their lands (1673). Although the Nguy\u1ec5n nominally accepted the L\u00ea King as the ruler of Vietnam, the reality was, the Nguy\u1ec5n ruled the south, and the Tr\u1ecbnh ruled the north. This division continued for the next 100 years. The border between the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n was strongly guarded but peaceful.\n\n==== T\u00e2y S\u01a1n rebellion and the end of dynasty ====\n{{main|T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty}}\n[[File:\u6731\u5370\u8239\u4ea4\u8dbe\u6e21\u822a\u56f3\u5dfb nguyen phuc nguyen.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Lord [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Nguy\u00ean]] greeted Japanese envoys in Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n, 1625.]]\nThe stalemate between the Tr\u1ecbnh and the [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords]] that began at the end of the 17th century did not, however, mark the beginning of a period of peace and prosperity. Instead the decades of continual warfare between the two families had left the ruists and peasantry in a weakened state, the victim of taxes levied to support the courts and their military adventures. Having to meet their tax obligations had forced many peasants off the land and facilitated the acquisition of large tracts by a few wealthy landowners, nobles, and scholar\u2014officials. Because scholar\u2014officials were exempted from having to pay a land tax, the more land they acquired, the greater was the burden that fell on those peasants who had been able to retain their land. In addition, the peasantry faced new taxes on staple items such as charcoal, salt, silk, and cinnamon, and on commercial activities such as fishing and mining. The disparate condition of the economy led to neglect of the extensive network of irrigation systems as well.\n[[File:T\u00e0u chi\u1ebfn t\u00e2y S\u01a1n.jpg|180px|thumb|right|T\u00e2y S\u01a1n large junk with cannons model]]\n\nAs they fell into disrepair, disastrous flooding and famine resulted, unleashing great numbers of starving and landless people to wander aimlessly about the countryside. The widespread suffering in North Vietnam led to numerous peasant revolts between 1730 and 1770, notable the peasant rebellion of [[Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea7u]] from 1748 to 1751. Although the uprisings took place throughout the country, they were essentially local phenomena, breaking out spontaneously from similar local causes. The occasional coordination between and among local movements did not result in any national organization or leadership. Moreover, most of the uprisings were conservative, in that the leaders supported the restoration of the L\u00ea dynasty. They did, however, put forward demands for land reform, more equitable taxes, and rice for all. Landless peasants accounted for most of the initial support for the various rebellions, but they were often joined later by craftsmen, fishermen, miners, and traders, who had been taxed out of their occupations. Some of these movements enjoyed limited success for a short time, but it was not until 1771 that any of the peasant revolts had a lasting national impact.\n\nDissatisfaction against two ruling families Tr\u1ecbnh and Nguy\u1ec5n lords spread through out the country. The T\u00e2y S\u01a1n were not content to simply conquer the southern provinces of Qu\u1ea3ng Nam. After a decade of fairly successful fighting in the south against the Nguy\u1ec5n Lords, Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 (the leading general of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n and no relation to the Nguy\u1ec5n ruling family) and his army marched north in 1785. The Royal army under Tr\u1ecbnh T\u00f4ng vanquished by Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7. Tr\u1ecbnh T\u00f4ng committed suicide and the L\u00ea Emperor submitted to the wishes of the victorious Hu\u1ec7 by giving his daughter in marriage to him. Hu\u1ec7 returned south and a few months later, the old emperor died.\n\nWhen [[L\u00ea M\u1eabn \u0110\u1ebf]] assumed the throne, the Tr\u1ecbnh tried to reassert control over the government. This provoked another march north from Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 and so the Emperor and the Tr\u1ecbnh fled from [[Hanoi|Dongkinh]]. L\u00ea Chi\u00eau Th\u1ed1ng sent envoy went to the Imperial court of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] to ask for aid against the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n. The [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the Qing Empire under the pretense of restoring L\u00ea dynasty dispatched a large force to invade Northern Vietnam.\n\nAt the beginning of the war, Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7's troops retreated to the South, refused to engage the Qing army. He raised a large army of his own and defeated the invader in the Lunar New year Eve of 1789. Chi\u00eau Th\u1ed1ng and the Royal family fled north into China, never to return. The L\u00ea Dynasty finally ended after ruled Vietnam for 360 years. He went to [[Beijing]] where \"''he was appointed a Chinese mandarin of the fourth rank and was enrolled under the Tatar banners. His family also remained in China, and from that date many former L\u00ea followers, who had not lost their hatred for the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n, expected to find in every rebel who raised the flag of rebellion in their country a descendant of the old royal bloodline. The last of these insurrections was that of the Brigadier General Li Hung Tsai in 1878''\".<ref>[http://art-hanoi.com/toda/16_.html ''Annam and its Minor Currency''], chapter 16.</ref>\n\n==Society and culture==\n[[File:\u842c\u570b\u4eba\u7269\u4e4b\u5716 \u8d8a\u5357\u4eba.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Vietnamese people in 1645 through a Japanese painting.]]\n[[File:S\u0129_n\u1eef_\u0111\u1ed3_\u4ed5\u5973\u5716.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A Vietnamese lady in Northern Vietnam, 1680s paintings.]]\n[[File:ThuykieuTruyen.jpg|180px|thumb|left|The cover of The Tales of Kieu poetry book, chap 24 in H\u00e1n N\u00f4m]]\nAfter ending the [[Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam]], people of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t started to rebuild the country.

Both male and female had loose long hair. In 1744, Lord [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Kho\u00e1t]] of [[\u0110\u00e0ng Trong]] ([[Hu\u1ebf]]) decreed that both men and women at his court wear trousers and a gown with buttons down the front.

Although both had arrived by the early sixteenth century, neither foreign merchants nor missionaries had much impact on Vietnam before the seventeenth century. The Portuguese, Dutch, English, and French had all established trading posts in [[Ph\u1ed5 Hi\u1ec1n]] by 1680. Fighting among the Europeans and opposition by the Vietnamese made the enterprises unprofitable, however, and all of the foreign trading posts were closed by 1700.\n\nEuropean missionaries had occasionally visited Vietnam for short periods of time, with little impact, beginning in the early sixteenth century. The best known of the early missionaries was [[Alexandre de Rhodes]], a French Jesuit who was sent to Hanoi in 1627, where he quickly learned the language and began preaching in Vietnamese. Initially, Rhodes was well received by the Trinh court, and he reportedly baptized more than 6,000 converts; however, his success probably led to his expulsion in 1630. He is credited with perfecting a romanized system of writing the Vietnamese language ([[qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef]]), which was probably developed as the joint effort of several missionaries, including Rhodes. He wrote the first catechism in Vietnamese and published a Vietnamese-Latin-Portuguese dictionary; these works were the first books printed in qu\u1ed1c-ng\u1eef. Qu\u1ed1c-ng\u1eef was used initially only by missionaries; [[h\u00e1n t\u1ef1]] or [[ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]] continued to be used by the court and the bureaucracy. The French later supported the use of qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef, which, because of its simplicity, led to a high degree of literacy and a flourishing of Vietnamese literature. After being expelled from Vi\u1ec7t Nam, Rhodes spent the next thirty years seeking support for his missionary work from the Vatican and the French [[Roman Catholic]] hierarchy as well as making several more trips to Vi\u1ec7t Nam.\n\nThe L\u00ea period was the continuously development era of Vietnamese scientific and Confucianism scholaric. [[Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i]] was a Early L\u00ea official, author of geography book [[:vi:D\u01b0 \u0111\u1ecba ch\u00ed|D\u01b0 \u0111\u1ecba ch\u00ed]]. [[L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n]] was a poet, encyclopedist, and government official, author of the geography book [[Ph\u1ee7 bi\u00ean t\u1ea1p l\u1ee5c]]. [[:zh:\u9ece\u6709\u666b|H\u1ea3i Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng L\u00e3n \u00d4ng]] was a famous Vietnamese doctor and pharmacist with his full collection 28-books [[:vi:H\u1ea3i Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng y t\u00f4ng t\u00e2m l\u0129nh|H\u1ea3i Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng y t\u00f4ng t\u00e2m l\u0129nh]] about [[traditional Vietnamese medicine]].\n\nThe L\u00ea Dynasty also saw the very flourish era of Vietnamese folk culture. Many types of entertainment and artistic sports, poetry, painting, stories, books, [[h\u00e1t tu\u1ed3ng]], [[ch\u00e8o]], [[c\u1ea3i l\u01b0\u01a1ng]], [[ca tr\u00f9]], ... developed to the peak. Many writers that were author of many popular stories and poets in H\u00e1n t\u1ef1 or ch\u1eef n\u00f4m; for examples, [[Nguy\u1ec5n Du]] with his populous ''[[The Tale of Ki\u1ec1u]]'', [[\u0110o\u00e0n Th\u1ecb \u0110i\u1ec3m]] with ''[[Chinh ph\u1ee5 ng\u00e2m]]'', [[Nguy\u1ec5n Gia Thi\u1ec1u]] with ''[[Cung o\u00e1n ng\u00e2m kh\u00fac]]'',...\n\nThe art forms of that time prospered and produced items of great artistic value, despite the upheavals and wars. Woodcarving was especially highly developed and produced items that were used for daily use or worship. Many of these items can be seen in the National Museum in Hanoi.\n<center><gallery>File:ThanhCungVanTue.jpg|Woodcut paintings \"Th\u00e1nh Cung v\u1ea1n tu\u1ebf\" (\"Long live his Imperial Majesty\") from the 18th-century [[Ngh\u1ec7 An]].\nFile:Vietnamese stoneware vase.jpg|Ceramic stoneware vase, fifteenth century\nFile:La statue de Quan Am dans la pagode But Thap 2.jpg|Statue of [[Avalokiteshvara]] Bodhisattva, crimson and gilded wood, Revival L\u00ea dynasty, autumn of B\u00ednh Th\u00e2n year (1656), from B\u00fat Th\u00e1p pagoda in [[B\u1eafc Ninh Province]].\nFile:DoGo.JPG|Wooden art pieces of the seventeenth century.\nFile:Nghe.jpg|[[Nghe]] (mythological beast) figurines, crimson and gilded wood, eighteenth century.\nFile:Legendary lion (Nghe), Lau Thuong Communale house, Phu Tho province, 17th century AD, wood - Vietnam National Museum of Fine Arts - Hanoi, Vietnam - DSC04934.JPG|Lion decorate in seventeenth century.\nFile:Dragon (Le dynasty, Vietnam).jpg|Dragon of the Later L\u00ea dynasty.\nFile:Buddhanandi, Tay Phuong pagoda, Ha Tay province, 1794 AD, lacquered wood - Vietnam National Museum of Fine Arts - Hanoi, Vietnam - DSC05080.JPG|Buddhanandi statue of the Le dynasty.\nFile:Tuong gom nghe thoi Canh Hung.png|Ceramic Lion bush , sixteenth century.\nFile:\u5b89\u5357\u912d\u653f\u5e9c\u00b7\u5bc4\u77eb\u9676\u74f7\u56688.jpg|Royal dish of the Le dynasty.\nFile:Pot in horse shape, Bat Trang kiln, Hanoi, Restored Le dynasty, 17th-18th century AD, polychrome ceramic - National Museum of Vietnamese History - Hanoi, Vietnam - DSC05424.JPG|Horse-shape pot, 1720s.\nFile:T\u1ef1 minh chung.png|Vietnamese produced \"T\u1ef1 Minh Chung\" clock, Cochinchina, 18th century.\n</gallery></center>\n\n==Economic development==\nDuring the L\u00ea Dynasty, the economy of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t grew fast thus it needed more open markets.

The economy was devastated in some regions of the country due to wars and battles, however, in most part of the country which were unaffected area, peace were maintained for a long time, agriculture, [[handicraft]] industries and international trading flourished, caused masses [[urbanization]] in some important cities.

Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, [[Kazimierz Kwiatkowski]], who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.<ref>https://culture.pl/en/artist/kazimierz-kwiatkowski</ref>\n\n===Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh===\n[[File:Citadel of Saigon 1815.png|180px|thumb|left|Map of Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh in 1790]]\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the [[Mekong Delta]] from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} In 1623, King [[Chey Chettha II]] of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] refugees fleeing the [[Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n War|Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war]] in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there.<ref>Mai Th\u1ee5c, ''{{lang|vi|V\u01b0\u01a1ng mi\u1ec7n l\u01b0u \u0111\u00e0y: truy\u1ec7n l\u1ecbch s\u1eed}}'', Nh\u00e0 xu\u1ea5t b\u1ea3n V\u0103n h\u00f3a \u2013 th\u00f4ng tin, 2004, p.580; Gi\u00e1o s\u01b0 Ho\u00e0ng Xu\u00e2n Vi\u1ec7t, Nguy\u1ec5n Minh Ti\u1ebfn hi\u1ec7u \u0111\u00ednh, ''{{lang|vi|T\u00ecm hi\u1ec3u l\u1ecbch s\u1eed ch\u1eef qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef}}'', Ho Chi Minh City, C\u00f4ng ty V\u0103n h\u00f3a H\u01b0\u01a1ng Trang, pp.31\u201333; Helen Jarvis, ''Cambodia'', Clio Press, 1997, p.xxiii.</ref> Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the [[Cambodia]]n kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area.

\u5f8c\u9ece\u671d), was the longest-ruling Vietnamese dynasty, ruling from 1428 to 1789 with a brief six-year interruption by the [[M\u1ea1c dynasty]] (1527\u20131533). It is usually divided into two historical periods \u2013 the Early L\u00ea dynasty (1428\u20131527) in which emperors ruled in their own right, and the [[Revival L\u00ea dynasty|Restored L\u00ea dynasty]] (1533\u20131789), in which figurehead emperors reigned under the auspices of the powerful [[Tr\u1ecbnh lords|Tr\u1ecbnh family]]. \n\nThe dynasty officially began in 1428 with the [[enthronement]] of [[L\u00ea L\u1ee3i]] after he drove the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] army from Vietnam. In 1527, the [[M\u1ea1c dynasty]] usurped the throne; when the L\u00ea dynasty was restored in 1533, the M\u1ea1c fled to the far north and continued to claim the throne during the period known as [[Southern and Northern Dynasties of Vietnam|Southern and Northern Dynasties]]. The restored L\u00ea emperors held no real power, and by the time the M\u1ea1c dynasty was finally eradicated in 1677, actual power lay in the hands of the [[Tr\u1ecbnh lords]] in the North and [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords]] in the South, both ruling in the name of the L\u00ea emperor while [[Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n War|fighting each other]]. The L\u00ea dynasty officially ended in 1789, when the peasant uprising of the [[T\u00e2y S\u01a1n]] brothers defeated both the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n, ironically in order to restore power to the L\u00ea dynasty.\n\nThe L\u00ea dynasty expanded Vietnam's borders through the [[Cham\u2013Vietnamese War (1471)|domination of the Kingdom of Champa]] nearly reaching its current size the time the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n brothers took over. It also saw massive changes to Vietnamese society: the previously Buddhist state became [[Confucianism|Confucian]] after 20 years of Ming rule. The L\u00ea emperors instituted many changes modeled after the Chinese system, including the [[civil service]] and laws. Their long-lasting rule was attributed to the popularity of the early emperors. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's liberation of the country from 20 years of Ming rule and [[L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng]]'s bringing the country into a golden age was well-remembered by the people. Even though the restored L\u00ea emperors' rule was marked by civil strife and constant peasant uprisings, few dared to openly challenge their power, at least in name, for fear of losing popular support. \n\n== History ==\n{{main|Lam S\u01a1n uprising}}\n=== Early L\u00ea (1428\u20131527) ===\n==== L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 and Founding of the L\u00ea dynasty ====\n{{main|L\u00ea L\u1ee3i}}\n[[File:Dien Kinh Thien 001.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Hall of K\u00ednh Thi\u00ean (\u656c\u5929\u6bbf), where L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was proclaimed emperor.

In 1384, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i was born as the son of a village leader in [[Thanh H\u00f3a Province|Thanh H\u00f3a]], the southern-most province of [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]], under the weakening rule of the [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty]]. In 1400, [[H\u1ed3 Qu\u00fd Ly]] overthrew the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty before establishing the short-lived [[H\u1ed3 dynasty]], renaming the country from \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t to [[\u0110\u1ea1i Ngu]]. In 1407, the Ming Empire under the [[Yongle Emperor]] [[Ming\u2013H\u1ed3 War|conquered]] the H\u1ed3 dynasty, starting the [[Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam|Ming domination]] of Vietnam. \n\nIn 1418 L\u00ea L\u1ee3i [[Lam S\u01a1n uprising|rose in revolt]] against Ming rule. After ten years of warfare the Ming were driven from Vietnam in 1428. L\u00ea L\u1ee3i proclaimed himself Emperor of [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]], posthumously known by his [[temple name]] L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 (\u9ece\u592a\u7956, L\u00ea the Founding Emperor), and was recognized by the [[Xuande Emperor]] of Ming.

The most prominent scandal was his affair with Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb L\u1ed9, the wife of his father's chief advisor Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i. The affair started early in 1442 and continued when the Emperor traveled to the home of Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i, who was venerated as a great Confucian scholar.\n\nShortly after the Emperor left Tr\u00e3i's home to continue his tour of the western province, he fell ill and died. At the time the powerful nobles in the court argued that the Emperor had been poisoned to death. Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i was [[Nine familial exterminations#Punishment|executed as were his three entire relations]], the normal punishment for treason at that time.\n\n==== L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng (ruled 1442\u20131459) ====\n{{main|L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng}}\nWith the Emperor's sudden death at a young age, his infant heir Bang Co was made emperor- although he was the second son of his father, his older brother Nghi D\u00e2n had been officially passed over due to his mother's low social status. Bang Co assumed the throne as [[L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng]] (\u9ece\u4ec1\u5b97) <ref name=CK/> but the real rulers were [[Tr\u1ecbnh Kh\u1ea3]] and the child's mother, the young Empress [[Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Anh]]. The next 17 years were good years for Vietnam \u2013 there were no great troubles either internally or externally. Two things of note occurred: first, the Vietnamese sent an army south to attack the [[Champa|Champa kingdom]] in 1446; second, the Dowager Empress ordered the execution of Tr\u1ecbnh Kh\u1ea3, for reasons lost to history, in 1451.\n\nIn 1453 at the age of twelve, L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng was formally given the title of Emperor. This was unusual as according to custom, youths could not ascend the throne till the age of 16. It may have been done to remove Nguy\u1ec5n Thi Anh from power, but if that was the reason, it failed and the Dowager Empress still controlled the government up until a coup in 1459.\n\nIn 1459, L\u00ea Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng's older brother, Nghi D\u00e2n, plotted with a group of followers to kill the Emperor. On October 28, the plotters with some 100 \"shiftless men\" infiltrated the palace and murdered the Emperor (he was just 18). The next day, facing certain execution the Dowager Empress committed suicide. The rule of Nghi D\u00e2n was brief, and he was never officially recognized as a sovereign by later Vietnamese historians. Revolts against his rule started almost immediately and the second revolt, occurring on June 24, 1460, succeeded. The rebels, led by L\u00ea L\u1ee3i's surviving former advsiors Nguy\u1ec5n X\u00ed and Dinh Li\u00eat captured and killed Nghi D\u00e2n along with his followers. The rebels then selected the youngest son of L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u00f4ng to be the new Emperor, who they proclaimed to be L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng.\n\n==== L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng (ruled 1460\u20131497) ====\n{{main|L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng}}\n[[File:B\u00ecnh H\u1ea3i t\u01b0\u1edbng qu\u00e2n chi \u1ea5n.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Imperial Seal of L\u00ea dynasty, 1479 version.]]\n[[File:Map of Later L\u00ea dynasty during the reign of L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng (1460-1497).png|thumb|right|200px|The area ruled by [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]]\n([[Vietnam]]) during the reign of [[L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng]] (1460\u20131497), including conquests in [[Muang Phuan]] and [[Champa]].

His rule, '''H\u1ed3ng \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecbnh Th\u1ebf''' or ''Prospered reign'' of H\u1ed3ng \u0110\u1ee9c (\u6d2a\u5fb7\u4e4b\u76db\u6cbb) (\u6d2a\u5fb7, meaning \"Flood of Virtue\") was one of the most notable and prosperity in Vietnamese history. He instituted a wide range of government reforms, legal reforms, and land reforms. He restarted the examination system for selecting men for important government positions. He reduced the power of the noble families and reduced the degree of corruption in the government. He built temples to Confucius throughout the provinces of [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]]. In nearly all respects, his reforms mirrored those of the [[Ming dynasty]].\nTh\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng was strongly influenced by his Confucian teachers and he resolved to make [[Name of Vietnam|Vi\u1ec7t Nam]] more like the [[Ming Dynasty]] with its [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucianist]] philosophy and the key idea that the government should be run by men of noble character as opposed to men from noble families. This meant that he needed to take power away from the ruling families (mostly from [[Thanh H\u00f3a Province|Thanh H\u00f3a province]]) and give power to the scholars who did well on the official examinations. The first step on this path was to revive the examination process, which had continued sporadically in the 1450s. The first examination was held in 1463 and, as expected, the top scholars were men from elsewhere- usually from the river delta surrounding the capital, not from [[Thanh H\u00f3a]].\n\nTh\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng encouraged the spread of Confucian values throughout Vietnam by having \"[[Temple of Confucius|temples of literature]]\" built in all the provinces. There, Confucius was venerated and classic works on Confucianism could be found. He also halted the building of any new Buddhist or Taoist temples and ordered that monks were not to be allowed to purchase any new land.\n\nFollowing the Chinese model, L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng divided the government into six ministries; they were Finance, Rites, Justice, Personnel, Army, and Public Works. Nine grades of rank were set up for both the civil administration and the military. A Board of Censors was set up with royal authority to monitor governmental officials and reported exclusively to the emperor. However, governmental authority did not extend all the way to the village level. The villages were ruled by their own councils in Vietnam (''Vietnam, Trials and Tribulations of a Nation'' D. R. SarDesai, ppg 35\u201337, 1988).\n\nWith the death of [[Nguy\u1ec5n X\u00fd]]  in 1465, the noble families from Thanh H\u00f3a province lost their leader. Soon they were mostly relegated to secondary positions in the new Confucian government of Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng. However, they still retained control over Vietnam's armies as the old general, \u0110inh Li\u1ec7t, was still in command of the army.\n\nIn 1465, Vietnam was attacked by [[Ryukyuan]] pirates from the northeast. This was dealt with by sending additional forces to the north to fight the pirates. Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng also sent a military force to the west to subdue the Ai-lao mountain tribes that was raiding the northwest border.\n\nIn 1469, all of Vietnam was mapped and a full census was taken, listing all the villages in the Empire. Around this time the country was divided into 13 dao (provinces). Each was administrated by a Governor, Judge, and the local army commander. The emperor Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng also ordered that a new census should be taken every six years. Other public works that were undertaken included building and repair of granaries, using the army to rebuild and repair irrigation systems after floods, and sending out doctors to areas afflicted by outbreaks of disease.

He was 38 years old at the time of his father's death. He was an affable, meek and mild-mannered person. Due to his short period of rule and that he didn't pass many significant reforms, his reign is considered to be an extension of L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng's rule. The new emperor was known to historical annals as [[L\u00ea Hi\u1ebfn T\u00f4ng]]. In early 1499, several high-ranking officials including L\u00ea V\u0129nh and L\u00ea N\u0103ng Nh\u01b0\u1ee3ng persuaded Hi\u1ebfn T\u00f4ng to choose an heir in order to maintain the dynasty's and the nation's security and sustainability.

The 17th years old L\u00ea Thu\u1ea7n inherited the throne.

L\u00ea Uy M\u1ee5c was described by a Ming ambassador \u2013 as a cruel, sadistic, and depraved person, who wasted the court's money and finances to indulge his whims. Well aware that he was detested by his subjects, L\u00ea Uy M\u1ee5c protected himself by hiring a group of elite bodyguards to surround him at all times. Among them was [[M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung]], who became very close to the emperor and eventually rose to the rank of general. Despite his precautions, in 1509 a cousin, whom L\u00ea Uy M\u1ee5c had put in prison, escaped and plotted with court insiders to assassinate the emperor. The assassination succeeded and the killer proclaimed himself emperor under the name L\u00ea T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u1ef1c.\n\n[[L\u00ea T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u1ef1c]] (\u9ece\u8944\u7ffc), [[posthumous name]] T\u01b0\u01a1ng D\u1ef1c Ho\u00e0ng \u0111\u1ebf (\u8944\u7ffc\u7687\u5e1d), proved to be just as bad a ruler as [[L\u00ea Uy M\u1ee5c]]. He reigned from 1510 to 1516, all the while spending down the royal treasury, and doing nothing to improve the country.  He was heedless to the reaction that his taxes caused throughout the country. Later in his reign, he spent extravagantly in building many colossal palaces in the imperial capital, [[Th\u0103ng Long]]. The most notable of those places was one  known to the Vietnamese as ''C\u1eedu Tr\u00f9ng \u0110\u00e0i'', designed by the emperor's favoured architect [[V\u0169 Nh\u01b0 T\u00f4]].

As usual when a young Emperor came to the throne, factions within the court vied with one another for control of the government.

After several years of increasing tension, the Nguy\u1ec5n and the Tr\u1ecbnh left the capital [[Hanoi]] (then called \u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u00f4) and fled south, with the Emperor \"under their protection\".\n\nIn 1524, M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung forces captured and executed the leaders of the revolt (Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng Du, Tr\u1ecbnh Duy \u0110\u1ea1i, and Tr\u1ecbnh Duy S\u1ea3n). The revolt by the Tr\u1ecbnh clan and the Nguy\u1ec5n clan was defeated for the moment. This was the start of a civil war with M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung and his supporters on one side and the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n on the other side. [[Thanh H\u00f3a Province]], the ancestral home to the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n, was the battle ground between the two sides. After several years of warfare, Emperor L\u00ea Chi\u00eau T\u00f4ng was assassinated in 1522 by M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung's supporters. Not long after, the leaders of the Nguy\u1ec5n and the Tr\u1ecbnh were executed. M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung was now the most powerful man in Vietnam.\n\n==== M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung usurps the throne ====\n{{Main|M\u1ea1c dynasty|M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung}}\n[[File:Vietnam matchlock of Qing period.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Vietnamese matchlock description of the Qing, 1660s]]\nThe degenerated L\u00ea dynasty, which endured under six rulers between 1497 and 1527, in the end was no longer able to maintain control over the northern part of the country, much less the new territories to the south. The weakening of the monarchy created a vacuum that the various noble families of the aristocracy were eager to fill. Soon after L\u00ea Chi\u00eau T\u00f4ng fled south with the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n in 1522, M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung proclaimed the Emperor's younger brother, L\u00ea Xu\u00e2n, as the new Emperor under the name [[L\u00ea Cung Ho\u00e0ng]]. In reality, the new Emperor had no power. Three years after M\u1ea1c's forces killed his older brother L\u00ea Chi\u00eau T\u00f4ng, was pressured from M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung, in B\u1eafc S\u1ee9 garden, L\u00ea Cung Ho\u00e0ng hanged himself in 18 June 1527. [[M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung]], being a scholar-official who had effectively controlled the L\u00ea for a decade, murdered all the L\u00ea royal family member then proclaimed himself the new Emperor of Vietnam in 15 June 1527, ending (so he thought) the L\u00ea dynasty (see [[M\u1ea1c dynasty]] for more details).\n\nM\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung's seizure of the throne prompted other families of the aristocracy, notably the Nguy\u1ec5n and Tr\u1ecbnh, to rush to the support of the L\u00ea royalists. With the usurpation of the throne, the civil war broke out anew. Again the Nguy\u1ec5n and the Tr\u1ecbnh gathered an army and fought against M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung, this time under the leadership of [[Nguy\u1ec5n Kim]] and [[Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m]].

Inasmuch as the Mac dynasty ruled the northern portion of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t while the L\u00ea dynasty ruled the remainder of the country, this time became known as the period of [[Southern and Northern Dynasties (Vietnam)|Northern and Southern dynasties]].\n\nIn 1545, Nguy\u1ec5n Kim was poisoned by D\u01b0\u01a1ng Ch\u1ea5p Nh\u1ea5t), a surrendered general of the M\u1ea1c dynasty. The power of royal court was then passed to Nguy\u1ec5n Kim's son-in-law [[Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m]] who became the founder of the [[Tr\u1ecbnh lords]]. Since then the emperor has only become a figurehead, Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m and his succesors were the ''[[de facto]]'' rulers of the country and continue the war with the M\u1ea1c. Unable to resist the forces of the L\u00ea royalists, the M\u1ea1c dynasty retreated to the north and established a new capital at [[Cao B\u1eb1ng Province]] allying with the [[Ming dynasty]] of [[China]] as a tributary nation against the L\u00ea dynasty. However, the Ming dynasty still recognized and the legitimates of the L\u00ea dynasty.\n\nLater, the first son of Nguy\u1ec5n Kim, ([[Nguy\u1ec5n Uong]]) was assassinated by Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m. Nguy\u1ec5n Kim's second son, [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ho\u00e0ng]], relocated to the south, became the Viceroy of [[Thu\u1eadn Ho\u00e1]] province, founded the line of [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords]], and started a revolt against the reign of the Tr\u1ecbnh lords. As such, \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t was divided for 232 years as the two lords fought each other in what is now known as the [[Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n War|Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil War]].\n\n==== Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n contention ====\n{{main|Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n War|Tr\u1ecbnh lords|Nguy\u1ec5n lords}}\n[[File:The King of Tunquin's Funeral preparation by Jean-Baptiste Tavernier (Part A).jpg|180px|thumb|left|A street in \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh during seventeenth century]]\n[[File:Vietnam1650.GIF|180px|thumb|left|Partition of Vietnam in 1650s, amid the Tr\u1ecbnh-Nguy\u1ec5n war]]\nIn 1620, Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Nguy\u00ean officially refused to send taxes to the court in Hanoi. A formal demand was made to the Nguy\u1ec5n to submit to the authority of the court, and it was formally refused. In 1623 Tr\u1ecbnh T\u00f9ng died and was succeeded by his son [[Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng]]. Now Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng made a formal demand for submission, and again Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Nguy\u00ean refused. Finally in 1627 open warfare broke out between the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n. For four months a large Tr\u1ecbnh army battled against the Nguy\u1ec5n army but were unable to defeat them. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The result of this war was that Vietnam had effectively been partitioned into [[Northern and southern Vietnam|northern and southern]] regions, with the Tr\u1ecbnh controlling most of the north and the Nguy\u1ec5n controlling most of the south; the dividing line was the [[Gianh River]] in [[Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province]]. This border was very close to the [[17th parallel north|Seventeenth parallel]] (in actuality the [[B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River]] located just to the south in [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province]]), which was imposed as the border between [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Partition of Vietnam]] (1954\u201375). {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nWhile the Tr\u1ecbnh ruled over a much more populous territory, the Nguy\u1ec5n had several advantages. First, they were on the defensive. Second, the Nguy\u1ec5n were able to take advantage of their contacts with the Europeans, specifically the Portuguese, to purchase advanced European weapons and hire European military experts in fortifications. Third, the geography was favorable to them, as the flat land suitable for large organized armies is very narrow at this point of Vietnam; the mountains nearly reach to the sea.<ref name=Dupuy>Dupuy, p. 653.</ref>\n\nAfter the first assault, the Nguy\u1ec5n built two massive fortified lines which stretched a few miles from the sea to the hills. The walls were built north of [[Hu\u1ebf]] near the city of [[\u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi]]. The Nguy\u1ec5n defended these lines against numerous Tr\u1ecbnh offensives which lasted till 1672.<ref name=Dupuy/> The story from this time is that the great military engineer was a Vietnamese general who was hired away from the Tr\u1ecbnh court by the Nguy\u1ec5n. This man is given the credit in Vietnam for the successful design of the Nguy\u1ec5n walls. Against the walls the Tr\u1ecbnh mustered an army of 100,000 men, 500 elephants, and 500 large ships (Dupuy \"Encyclopedia of Military History\" pg. 596). The initial attacks on the Nguy\u1ec5n wall was unsuccessful. The attacks lasted for several years.\n\n[[Image:VN rifles.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Upper:Goa style arquebuses \u2013 Probably were widespread in Vietnam during the 17th century]]\nIn 1633 the Tr\u1ecbnh tried an amphibious assault on the Nguy\u1ec5n to get around the wall. The Tr\u1ecbnh fleet was defeated by the Nguy\u1ec5n fleet at the battle of Nhat-Le.<ref name=Dupuy/> Around 1635 the Tr\u1ecbnh copied the Nguy\u1ec5n and sought military aid from the Europeans. Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng hired the [[VOC]] to make cannons and ships for the Royal army. In 1642\u201343, the Tr\u1ecbnh army attacked the Nguy\u1ec5n walls. With the aid of the Dutch cannons, the Tr\u1ecbnh army broke through the first wall but failed to break through the second. At sea, the Tr\u1ecbnh, with their Dutch ships ''[[Kievit]]'', ''Nachtegaels'' and ''[[Woekende Book]]'' were destroyed in a humiliating defeat by the Nguy\u1ec5n fleet with their Chinese style galleys.<ref>Reid p. 230.</ref><ref>Hoang, p. 83.</ref><ref>Wiest, p. 23.</ref><ref>Li, p. 96.</ref><ref>Weiss, p. 176.</ref> Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng staged yet another offensive in 1648 but at the battle of Truong Duc, the Royal army was badly beaten by the Nguy\u1ec5n.<ref name=Dupuy/> The new L\u00ea king died around this time, perhaps as a result of the defeat. This now left the door open for the Nguy\u1ec5n to finally go on the offensive.\n\nThe Nguy\u1ec5n launched their own invasion of northern Vietnam in 1653. The Nguy\u1ec5n army attacked north and defeated the weakened Royal army. [[Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province]] was captured. Then [[H\u00e0 T\u0129nh Province]] fell to the Nguy\u1ec5n army. In the following year, Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng died as Nguy\u1ec5n forces made attacks into [[Ngh\u1ec7 An Province]]. Under a new Tr\u1ecbnh Lord, the capable [[Tr\u1ecbnh T\u1ea1c]], the Royal army attacked the Nguy\u1ec5n army and defeated it. The Nguy\u1ec5n were fatally weakened by a division between their two top generals who refused to cooperate with each other. In 1656 the Nguy\u1ec5n army was driven back all the way to their original walls. Tr\u1ecbnh T\u1ea1c tried to break the walls of the Nguy\u1ec5n in 1661 but this attack, like so many before it, failed to break through the walls.\n\nIn 1672, the Tr\u1ecbnh army made a last effort to conquer the Nguy\u1ec5n. The attacking army was under the command of Tr\u1ecbnh T\u1ea1c's son, [[Tr\u1ecbnh C\u0103n]], while the defending army was under the command of [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac T\u1ea7n]]'s son Prince [[:vi:T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Hi\u1ec7p (t\u01b0\u1edbng ch\u00faa Nguy\u1ec5n)|Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Thu\u1eadn]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The attack, like all the previous attacks on the Nguy\u1ec5n walls, failed. This time the two sides agreed to a peace. With mediation supplied by the government of the [[Kangxi Emperor]], the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n finally agreed to end the fighting by making the [[Linh River]] the border between their lands (1673). Although the Nguy\u1ec5n nominally accepted the L\u00ea King as the ruler of Vietnam, the reality was, the Nguy\u1ec5n ruled the south, and the Tr\u1ecbnh ruled the north. This division continued for the next 100 years. The border between the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n was strongly guarded but peaceful.\n\n==== T\u00e2y S\u01a1n rebellion and the end of dynasty ====\n{{main|T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty}}\n[[File:\u6731\u5370\u8239\u4ea4\u8dbe\u6e21\u822a\u56f3\u5dfb nguyen phuc nguyen.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Lord [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Nguy\u00ean]] greeted Japanese envoys in Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n, 1625.]]\nThe stalemate between the Tr\u1ecbnh and the [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords]] that began at the end of the 17th century did not, however, mark the beginning of a period of peace and prosperity. Instead the decades of continual warfare between the two families had left the ruists and peasantry in a weakened state, the victim of taxes levied to support the courts and their military adventures. Having to meet their tax obligations had forced many peasants off the land and facilitated the acquisition of large tracts by a few wealthy landowners, nobles, and scholar\u2014officials. Because scholar\u2014officials were exempted from having to pay a land tax, the more land they acquired, the greater was the burden that fell on those peasants who had been able to retain their land. In addition, the peasantry faced new taxes on staple items such as charcoal, salt, silk, and cinnamon, and on commercial activities such as fishing and mining. The disparate condition of the economy led to neglect of the extensive network of irrigation systems as well.\n[[File:T\u00e0u chi\u1ebfn t\u00e2y S\u01a1n.jpg|180px|thumb|right|T\u00e2y S\u01a1n large junk with cannons model]]\n\nAs they fell into disrepair, disastrous flooding and famine resulted, unleashing great numbers of starving and landless people to wander aimlessly about the countryside. The widespread suffering in North Vietnam led to numerous peasant revolts between 1730 and 1770, notable the peasant rebellion of [[Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea7u]] from 1748 to 1751. Although the uprisings took place throughout the country, they were essentially local phenomena, breaking out spontaneously from similar local causes. The occasional coordination between and among local movements did not result in any national organization or leadership. Moreover, most of the uprisings were conservative, in that the leaders supported the restoration of the L\u00ea dynasty. They did, however, put forward demands for land reform, more equitable taxes, and rice for all. Landless peasants accounted for most of the initial support for the various rebellions, but they were often joined later by craftsmen, fishermen, miners, and traders, who had been taxed out of their occupations. Some of these movements enjoyed limited success for a short time, but it was not until 1771 that any of the peasant revolts had a lasting national impact.\n\nDissatisfaction against two ruling families Tr\u1ecbnh and Nguy\u1ec5n lords spread through out the country. The T\u00e2y S\u01a1n were not content to simply conquer the southern provinces of Qu\u1ea3ng Nam. After a decade of fairly successful fighting in the south against the Nguy\u1ec5n Lords, Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 (the leading general of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n and no relation to the Nguy\u1ec5n ruling family) and his army marched north in 1785. The Royal army under Tr\u1ecbnh T\u00f4ng vanquished by Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7. Tr\u1ecbnh T\u00f4ng committed suicide and the L\u00ea Emperor submitted to the wishes of the victorious Hu\u1ec7 by giving his daughter in marriage to him. Hu\u1ec7 returned south and a few months later, the old emperor died.\n\nWhen [[L\u00ea M\u1eabn \u0110\u1ebf]] assumed the throne, the Tr\u1ecbnh tried to reassert control over the government. This provoked another march north from Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 and so the Emperor and the Tr\u1ecbnh fled from [[Hanoi|Dongkinh]]. L\u00ea Chi\u00eau Th\u1ed1ng sent envoy went to the Imperial court of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] to ask for aid against the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n. The [[Qianlong Emperor]] of the Qing Empire under the pretense of restoring L\u00ea dynasty dispatched a large force to invade Northern Vietnam.\n\nAt the beginning of the war, Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7's troops retreated to the South, refused to engage the Qing army. He raised a large army of his own and defeated the invader in the Lunar New year Eve of 1789. Chi\u00eau Th\u1ed1ng and the Royal family fled north into China, never to return. The L\u00ea Dynasty finally ended after ruled Vietnam for 360 years. He went to [[Beijing]] where \"''he was appointed a Chinese mandarin of the fourth rank and was enrolled under the Tatar banners. His family also remained in China, and from that date many former L\u00ea followers, who had not lost their hatred for the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n, expected to find in every rebel who raised the flag of rebellion in their country a descendant of the old royal bloodline. The last of these insurrections was that of the Brigadier General Li Hung Tsai in 1878''\".<ref>[http://art-hanoi.com/toda/16_.html ''Annam and its Minor Currency''], chapter 16.</ref>\n\n==Society and culture==\n[[File:\u842c\u570b\u4eba\u7269\u4e4b\u5716 \u8d8a\u5357\u4eba.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Vietnamese people in 1645 through a Japanese painting.]]\n[[File:S\u0129_n\u1eef_\u0111\u1ed3_\u4ed5\u5973\u5716.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A Vietnamese lady in Northern Vietnam, 1680s paintings.]]\n[[File:ThuykieuTruyen.jpg|180px|thumb|left|The cover of The Tales of Kieu poetry book, chap 24 in H\u00e1n N\u00f4m]]\nAfter ending the [[Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam]], people of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t started to rebuild the country.

Both male and female had loose long hair. In 1744, Lord [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Kho\u00e1t]] of [[\u0110\u00e0ng Trong]] ([[Hu\u1ebf]]) decreed that both men and women at his court wear trousers and a gown with buttons down the front. That the Nguyen Lords introduced ancient [[\u00e1o d\u00e0i]] ([[\u00e1o ng\u0169 th\u00e2n]]). The members of the [[\u0110\u00e0ng Trong]] court (southern court) were thus distinguished from the courtiers of the [[Tr\u1ecbnh Lords]] in [[\u0110\u00e0ng Ngo\u00e0i]] ([[Hanoi]]), who wore ''\u00e1o giao l\u0129nh'' with long skirts.\n\nThe seventeenth century was also a period in which European missionaries and merchants became a serious factor in Vietnamese court life and politics. Although both had arrived by the early sixteenth century, neither foreign merchants nor missionaries had much impact on Vietnam before the seventeenth century. The Portuguese, Dutch, English, and French had all established trading posts in [[Ph\u1ed5 Hi\u1ec1n]] by 1680. Fighting among the Europeans and opposition by the Vietnamese made the enterprises unprofitable, however, and all of the foreign trading posts were closed by 1700.\n\nEuropean missionaries had occasionally visited Vietnam for short periods of time, with little impact, beginning in the early sixteenth century. The best known of the early missionaries was [[Alexandre de Rhodes]], a French Jesuit who was sent to Hanoi in 1627, where he quickly learned the language and began preaching in Vietnamese. Initially, Rhodes was well received by the Trinh court, and he reportedly baptized more than 6,000 converts; however, his success probably led to his expulsion in 1630. He is credited with perfecting a romanized system of writing the Vietnamese language ([[qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef]]), which was probably developed as the joint effort of several missionaries, including Rhodes. He wrote the first catechism in Vietnamese and published a Vietnamese-Latin-Portuguese dictionary; these works were the first books printed in qu\u1ed1c-ng\u1eef. Qu\u1ed1c-ng\u1eef was used initially only by missionaries; [[h\u00e1n t\u1ef1]] or [[ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]] continued to be used by the court and the bureaucracy. The French later supported the use of qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef, which, because of its simplicity, led to a high degree of literacy and a flourishing of Vietnamese literature. After being expelled from Vi\u1ec7t Nam, Rhodes spent the next thirty years seeking support for his missionary work from the Vatican and the French [[Roman Catholic]] hierarchy as well as making several more trips to Vi\u1ec7t Nam.\n\nThe L\u00ea period was the continuously development era of Vietnamese scientific and Confucianism scholaric. [[Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i]] was a Early L\u00ea official, author of geography book [[:vi:D\u01b0 \u0111\u1ecba ch\u00ed|D\u01b0 \u0111\u1ecba ch\u00ed]]. [[L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n]] was a poet, encyclopedist, and government official, author of the geography book [[Ph\u1ee7 bi\u00ean t\u1ea1p l\u1ee5c]]. [[:zh:\u9ece\u6709\u666b|H\u1ea3i Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng L\u00e3n \u00d4ng]] was a famous Vietnamese doctor and pharmacist with his full collection 28-books [[:vi:H\u1ea3i Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng y t\u00f4ng t\u00e2m l\u0129nh|H\u1ea3i Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng y t\u00f4ng t\u00e2m l\u0129nh]] about [[traditional Vietnamese medicine]].\n\nThe L\u00ea Dynasty also saw the very flourish era of Vietnamese folk culture. Many types of entertainment and artistic sports, poetry, painting, stories, books, [[h\u00e1t tu\u1ed3ng]], [[ch\u00e8o]], [[c\u1ea3i l\u01b0\u01a1ng]], [[ca tr\u00f9]], ... developed to the peak. Many writers that were author of many popular stories and poets in H\u00e1n t\u1ef1 or ch\u1eef n\u00f4m; for examples, [[Nguy\u1ec5n Du]] with his populous ''[[The Tale of Ki\u1ec1u]]'', [[\u0110o\u00e0n Th\u1ecb \u0110i\u1ec3m]] with ''[[Chinh ph\u1ee5 ng\u00e2m]]'', [[Nguy\u1ec5n Gia Thi\u1ec1u]] with ''[[Cung o\u00e1n ng\u00e2m kh\u00fac]]'',...\n\nThe art forms of that time prospered and produced items of great artistic value, despite the upheavals and wars. Woodcarving was especially highly developed and produced items that were used for daily use or worship.

The [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords]] were far more interested in commercial activity than the [[Tr\u1ecbnh lords]] who ruled the north. As a result, H\u1ed9i An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the [[East Vietnam Sea]].

Local historians also say that H\u1ed9i An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H\u1ed9i An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, [[Kazimierz Kwiatkowski]], who finally brought back H\u1ed9i An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.<ref>https://culture.pl/en/artist/kazimierz-kwiatkowski</ref>\n\n===Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh===\n[[File:Citadel of Saigon 1815.png|180px|thumb|left|Map of Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh in 1790]]\nBeginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the [[Mekong Delta]] from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} In 1623, King [[Chey Chettha II]] of Cambodia (1618\u201328) allowed [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] refugees fleeing the [[Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n War|Tr\u1ecbnh\u2013Nguy\u1ec5n civil war]] in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a customs house there.<ref>Mai Th\u1ee5c, ''{{lang|vi|V\u01b0\u01a1ng mi\u1ec7n l\u01b0u \u0111\u00e0y: truy\u1ec7n l\u1ecbch s\u1eed}}'', Nh\u00e0 xu\u1ea5t b\u1ea3n V\u0103n h\u00f3a \u2013 th\u00f4ng tin, 2004, p.580; Gi\u00e1o s\u01b0 Ho\u00e0ng Xu\u00e2n Vi\u1ec7t, Nguy\u1ec5n Minh Ti\u1ebfn hi\u1ec7u \u0111\u00ednh, ''{{lang|vi|T\u00ecm hi\u1ec3u l\u1ecbch s\u1eed ch\u1eef qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef}}'', Ho Chi Minh City, C\u00f4ng ty V\u0103n h\u00f3a H\u01b0\u01a1ng Trang, pp.31\u201333; Helen Jarvis, ''Cambodia'', Clio Press, 1997, p.xxiii.</ref> Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the [[Cambodia]]n kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area.

The most notable examples are the great [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedrals of France, including [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], [[Chartres Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  Its main characteristics were the search for verticality, or height, and the innovative use of [[flying buttress]]es and other architectural innovations to distribute the weight of the stone structures to supports on the outside, allowing unprecedented height and volume,  The new techniques also permitted the addition of larger windows, including enormous stained glass windows, which filled the cathedrals with light.  The French style was widely copied in other parts of northern Europe, particularly Germany and England.  It was gradually supplanted as the dominant French style in the mid-16th century by [[French Renaissance architecture]].<ref>Ducher, Robert, ''Caract\u00e9ristique des Styles'' (1988), pp. 46\u201354</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nFrench Gothic architecture was the result of the emergence in the 12th century of powerful French state centered in the [[\u00cele-de-France]]. During the reign of [[Louis VI of France]] (1081\u20131137),  Paris was the principal residence of the Kings of France, [[Reims]]  the place of coronation, and the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]] became their ceremonial burial place. The Abbot of Saint-Denis, [[Suger]], was a counselor of Louis VI and Louis VII, as well as a historian.  He oversaw the reconstruction of the ambulatory of Saint-Denis, making it the first and most influential example of Gothic architecture in France.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 33</ref>\n\nOver the later course of the [[Capetian dynasty]] (1180 to 1328), three Kings: [[Philip Augustus]] (1180\u20131223), [[Louis IX of France]] (1226\u20131270), and [[Philip le Bel]] (1285\u20131314), established France as the major economic and political power on the Continent. The period also saw the founding of the University of Paris or [[Sorbonne]]. It produced the High Gothic and the [[Flamboyant|Flamboyant Gothic]] styles, and the construction of some of the most famous cathedrals, including [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), pp. 33\u201335</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ceiling, Notre Dame, Paris, ZM.JPG|Six-part rib vaults of ceiling of Notre-Dame Cathedral\nFile:Voutes, nef, rosace ouest et grandes orgues de la cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame d'Amiens, France - 20080125-02.jpg|Four-part rib vaults at Amiens Cathedral allowed greater height and larger windows\nFile:Amiens Cath\u00e9drale Notre-dame arc-boutant sud-est 4.jpg|Flying buttresses of [[Amiens Cathedral]].

The rib vault was known in the earlier [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque period]], but it was not widely or effectively used until the Gothic period.  The crossed ribs of the vault carried the weight outwards and downwards, to clusters of supporting pillars and columns.  The earlier rib vaults, used at [[Sens Cathedral]] and [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]], had six compartments bordered by ribs and the crossing arch, which transferred the weight to alternating columns and pillars.  A new innovation appeared during the High Gothic: the four-part rib vault, which was used in [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Amiens Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]].  The ribs of this vault distributed the weight more equally to the four supporting pillars below and established a closer connection between the nave and the lower portions of the church walls, and between the arcades below and the windows above. This allowed for greater height and thinner walls and contributed to the strong impression of verticality given by the newer Cathedrals.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 34</ref>\n\n===The flying buttress===\nThe second major innovation of the Gothic style was the [[flying buttress]], which was first used at [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]]. This transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof outside the walls, where it was countered by the weight of the buttress.  Heavy stone [[pinnacle]]s were added to the top of the buttresses, to precisely counterbalance the thrust from inside the walls. The buttress allowed a significant reduction in the thickness of the cathedral walls, and permitted the use of larger windows in the interior of the church. In churches such as [[Sainte Chapelle]], thanks to buttresses, the walls were made almost entirely of stained glass.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 34</ref>\n\nThe development of rib-vaults and buttresses brought gradual changes to the interior structure of cathedrals. Early Gothic cathedrals had the walls of the nave built in four levels: a gallery with columns on the ground level; then the [[Tribune (architecture)#Meanings|tribune]], a gallery with windows; then the [[triforium]], a row of smaller windows; and finally the high windows, just below the vaults. During the High Gothic period, with the development of the four-part rib vault and the flying buttress, the tribune was eliminated at Chartres and other new cathedrals, allowing taller windows and arcades. By the 15th century, at Rouen Cathedral, the triforium also disappeared, and the walls between the traverses were filled with high windows.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), pp. 48\u201349</ref>\n\n===The portal and tympanum===\nAnother innovative feature of the French Gothic cathedral was the design of the [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] or entry, which by long Christian tradition faced west. The [[Basilica of St Denis]] had a triple portal, decorated with columns in the form of statues of apostles and saints around the doorways, and biblical scenes crowded with statuary over the doorways.  This triple portal was adopted by all the major cathedrals. A [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the portal, crowded with sculptural figures illustrating a biblical story became a feature of Gothic cathedrals. Following the example of Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal traditionally depicted the [[Last Judgement]], the right portal showed the coronation of the Virgin Mary, and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 35</ref>\n\n===Stained glass and the rose window===\n\nLarge [[stained glass]] windows and [[rose windows]] were another defining feature of the Gothic style.  Some Gothic windows, like those at Chartres, were cut into the stone walls. Other windows, such as those in the chapels of Notre-Dame and Reims, were in stone frames installed into the walls.  The most common form was an oculus, a small round window with two lancets, or windows with pointed arches, just below it.  The rose window was the most famous type of the Gothic style.  They were plead in the [[transept]]s and the portals to provide light to the nave. The largest rose windows were ten meters in diameter. They had a framework of stone armatures often in an ornate floral pattern, to help them resist the wind. Gothic windows were in a stone frame separate from the wall, not cut into the wall.\n\nThe early windows were made of pieces of tinted glass, touched up with [[grisaille]] painting, and held in place by pieces of lead that outlined the figures. As the windows grew larger, more intense colors were used. After 1260, the colors became lighter, and the combination of grisaille and pale shades of yellow became more common. [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Le Mans Cathedral]] have some of the finest surviving original windows.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 52</ref>\n\n==Sequence of Gothic styles==\nThe periods of French Gothic architecture are generally given as follows:<ref>Wenzler (2018), pp. 31\u201337</ref>\n\n* '''Early Gothic''' '''Transition''' or '''Primitive Gothic''' (1130\u20131230)\n* '''High Gothic''' or '''Classic Gothic''' (1230\u20131330)\n* '''[[Rayonnant]]'''  (14th century)\n* '''[[Flamboyant]]''' (15th century)\n* '''Late Gothic'''  (16th century)\n\nBecause of the lengthy period of construction of Gothic cathedrals, very few were built in a single style. Most, like Notre-Dame, have a combination of features constructed in several different periods, as well as features constructed after the Gothic age.\n\n==Early Gothic Style - Saint-Denis, Sens, Senlis, and Notre Dame==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Saint-Denis - Fa\u00e7ade.jpg|[[Basilica of Saint Denis]], west facade (1135\u201340)\nFile:Basilica Saint Denis ambulatory.JPG|Ambulatory of [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] (1135-40)\nFile:Interior of Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Sens-6974.jpg|Nave of [[Sens Cathedral]] (1140-1164)\nFile:Senlis Cathedral Nave, Picardy, France - Diliff.jpg|Nave of [[Senlis Cathedral]] (1153\u201391)\nFile:Gothic architecture of Notre Dame de Paris.jpg|Flying buttress at [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] (1163\u20131345)\n</gallery>\nThe birthplace of the new style was the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] in the [[\u00cele-de-France]], not far north of Paris where, in 1137, the [[Abb\u00e9 Suger]] began the reconstruction of the [[Carolingian]]-era abbey church. He began building a new structure with two towers to the west of the original church, and then from 1140 to 1144 began to reconstruct the old church. Most of his modifications were traditional, but he made one remarkable innovation; he decided to create a new [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] at the east end of the building, eliminating the traditional supporting walls of the old chapels, giving the interior a striking appearance of openness and greater height.<ref>Ducher, Robert, ''Caract\u00e9ristique des Styles'' (1988), pp. 46\u201354</ref>\n\nTo achieve his aims, Suger's masons drew on the several new elements which evolved or had been introduced to Romanesque architecture: the [[pointed arch]], the ribbed [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], the [[ambulatory]] with radiating chapels, and the columns wrapped in the ribs which supported the vaults. The builders constructed the walls of the church in four levels;  the [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]], whose two rows of columns received the ribs of the ceiling vaults; the tribune above it, a gallery which concealed the massive contreforts or buttresses which pressed against the walls; the [[triforium]], another, narrower gallery;  and, just below the ceiling, the ''claire-voie'' or [[clerestorey]], where the windows were located.  All of these features had existed in the Romanesque period, but it was the first time they had all been combined and the result differed dramatically from the previous Romanesque architecture.  Another innovation introduced by Suger was the use of columns in the form of statues of saints to decorate the portal of the church, adding a new element of verticality to the facade. This idea too was copied in new cathedrals.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 36</ref>\n\nThe new style quickly became known to the builders of new cathedrals.  The first cathedral built in the new style was  [[Sens Cathedral]], begun between 1135 and 1140 and consecrated in 1160.{{sfn|Mignon (2015|pp. 10-11}}<ref> ''Le Guide du Patrimoine de France'' (2002) pg. 53</ref>  It featured a Gothic choir, and six part rib vaults over the nave and collateral aisles, alternating pillars and doubled columns to support the vaults, and flying buttresses. {{Sfn|Mignon One of the builders of Sens Cathedral, [[William of Sens]], later traveled to England and became the architect who reconstructed the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in the Gothic style. Sens was quickly followed by  [[Senlis Cathedral]] (begun 1160), and the most prominent of all, [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in Paris (begun 1160). Their builders abandoned the traditional plans and introduced the new Gothic elements.  The builders of Notre Dame went further by introducing the flying buttress, heavy columns of support outside the walls connected by arches to the walls, which received and counterbalanced the thrust from the rib vaults of the roof.  This allowed the builders to construct higher walls and larger windows.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 36</ref>\n\n==High Gothic Cathedrals - Chartres, Bourges, Reims, Amiens==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:20050921CathChartresB.jpg|[[Rose window]] and facade of [[Chartres Cathedral]] (1194\u20131220)\nFile:Chartres - Cath\u00e9drale 16.JPG|Choir of [[Chartres Cathedral]]\nFile:Cath\u00e9drale de Bourges (Cher).jpg|[[Bourges Cathedral]] with flying buttresses (1195\u20131230)\nFile:ReimsCathedral0116.jpg|[[Reims Cathedral]] from the northwest (1211\u20131345)\nFile:0 Amiens - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (1).JPG|Facade of [[Amiens Cathedral]] (1220\u20131266)\nFile:Amiens Cathedral choir Wikimedia Commons.jpg|[[Amiens Cathedral]] choir and altar\n</gallery>\nFrom the end of the 12th century until the middle of the 13th century, the Gothic style spread from the cathedrals in \u00cele-de-France to appear in other cities of northern France, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] (begun 1200); [[Bourges Cathedral]] (1195 to 1230), [[Reims Cathedral]] (1211\u20131275), and [[Amiens Cathedral]] (begun 1250);<ref>Ducher, ''Caract\u00e9ristique des Styles'' (1988), p. 48</ref> The characteristic Gothic elements were refined to make the new cathedrals taller, wider, and more full of light. At Chartres, the use of the flying buttresses allowed the elimination of the tribune level, which allowed much higher arcades and nave, and larger windows. The pillars were made of a central column surrounded by four more slender columns, which reached up to support the arches of the vaulted ceiling. The [[rib vault]] changed from six to four ribs, simpler and stronger. The [[flying buttress]]es at Amiens and Chartes were strengthened by an additional arch and with a supporting arcade, allowing even higher walls and more windows. At Reims, the buttresses were given greater weight and strength by the addition of heavy stone pinacles on top. These were often decorated with statues of angels, and became an important decorative element of the High Gothic style. Another practical and decorative element, the [[gargoyle]], appeared; it was an ornamental rain spout which channeled the water from the roof away from the building. At Amiens, the windows of the nave were made larger, and an additional row of clear glass windows (the ''claire-voie'') flooded the interior with light. The new structural technologies allowed the enlargement of the transepts and the choirs at the east end of the cathedrals, creating the space for a ring of well-lit chapels.<ref>Ducher, ''Caract\u00e9ristique des Styles'' (1988), p. 48</ref>\n\n==Rayonnant Gothic - Sainte-Chapelle and the rose windows of Notre-Dame==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Sainte Chapelle Interior Stained Glass.jpg|Windows of upper chapel of [[Sainte-Chapelle]] (1238\u201348)\nFile:SteChapelle von N.JPG|Columns of exterior framework supporting the windows of Sainte-Chapelle\nFile:North rose window of Notre-Dame de Paris, Aug 2010.jpg|Rose window in north transept of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]\nFile:Rose du transept Sud Notre-Dame de Paris 170208 04.jpg|Exterior of south rose window of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]\n</gallery>\nThe next period of French Gothic architecture, from the second half of the 13th century until the 1370s, was termed ''Rayonnant'' (\"Radiant\"), describing the tendency toward the use of more and more stained glass and less masonry in the design of the structure, until the walls seemed entirely made of glass.  The most celebrated example was the chapel of [[Sainte-Chapelle]], attached to the royal residence on the [[Palais de la Cit\u00e9]].  An elaborate system of exterior columns and arches reduced the walls of the upper chapel to a thin framework for the enormous windows. The weight of each of the masonry gables above the [[archivolt]] of the windows also helped the walls to resist the thrust and to distribute the weight.<ref>Ducher (1988), p. 58</ref>\n\nAnother landmark of the Rayonnant Gothic are the two rose windows on the north and south of the transept of [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]], whereas earlier rose windows, like those of [[Amiens Cathedral]], were framed by stone and occupied only a portion of the wall, these two windows, with a delicate lacelike framework, occupied the entire space between the pillars.<ref>Ducher (1988), p. 58</ref>\n\n==Flamboyant Gothic - Rouen Cathedral, Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nCath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Rouen - panoramio (1).jpg|West facade, [[Rouen Cathedral]]\nParis Sainte Chapelle du Chateau de Vincennes ancienne demeure royale Vers le Bois de Vincennes en France angle 3.JPG|The west front of [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] (1370s)\nInterior of Sainte Chapelle, Vincennes 140308 1.jpg|The nave of [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]]\nRose Window of Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes, Interior View 140308 1.jpg|The rose window [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]].

Its characteristic features were more exuberant decoration, as the nobles and wealthy citizens of mostly northern French cities competed to build more and more elaborate churches and cathedrals. It took its name from the sinuous, flame-like designs which ornamented windows. Other new features included the ''arc en accolade'', a window decorated with an arch, stone pinnacles and floral sculpture. It also featured an increase in the number of ''nervures'', or ribs, that supported and decorated each vault of the ceiling, both for greater support and decorative effect.  Notable examples of Flamboyant Gothic include the western facade of [[Rouen Cathedral]] and [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] in Paris, both built in the 1370s; and the Choir of [[Mont Saint Michel Abbey]] (about 1448).<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 37</ref>\n\n==Religious architecture in the French regions==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nHopital-St-Jean-Angers (3).JPG|Angevin Gothic vaults and columns in the Hopital-St-Jean in [[Angers]]\nVo\u00fbte angevine dite Plantagen\u00eat de l'Eglise du Puy-Notre-Dame DSC 1856.jpg|Angevin Gothic vault of the Church of Puy-Notre Dame\nCath\u00e9drale St B\u00e9nigne - Dijon.jpg|West facade of [[Dijon Cathedral]] in [[Burgundy]] (1280\u20131325)\nFile:Interior - Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Vincent de Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne - DSC06108.JPG|Nave of [[Chalon Cathedral]] in [[Burgundy]] (1220\u20131522)\nFile:Poitiers Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre AL1.jpg|Facade of [[Poitiers Cathedral]] (1155\u20131379)\nFile:085 Nevers Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Cyr-et-Sainte-Julitte Vue int\u00e9rieure.jpg|Choir of [[Nevers Cathedral]] (1211\u20131331)\nFile:Albi Sainte-C\u00e9cile.JPG|[[Albi Cathedral]] in southwest France (1282\u20131480), built of brick\nFile:Nave of the Ste C\u00e9cile Cathedral - 2014-02-22.jpg|Polychrome nave of [[Albi Cathedral]] (1282\u20131480)\nPalmier des Jacobins.JPG|The Palm Tree of the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins church]] ([[Toulouse]], circa 1292)\n</gallery>\nThe most famous examples of Gothic architecture are found in the [[\u00cele-de-France]] and [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], but other French regions created their own original versions of the style. The Angevin Gothic style in the province of [[Anjou]] features vaults with elegant decorative ribs, as well as very ornate columns.  The style is found in the interior of [[Angers Cathedral]] (1032\u20131523), though many of the Gothic elements of the facade were replaced with Renaissance elements and towers. A very fine example of Angevin Gothic is found in the medieval Saint Jean Hospital in Angers, which now contains the Mus\u00e9e Jean-Lur\u00e7at, a museum of contemporary tapestries.<ref>Ducher (1988) p. 62</ref>\n\n[[Poitiers Cathedral]] in the historic province of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] also features a distinctive regional Gothic style. It was begun in 1162 under King [[Henry II of England]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. Its distinctive features, like those of Angevin Gothic, include convex vaults with ribs in decorative designs.<ref>Ducher (1988) p. 62</ref>\n\nBurgundy also had its own version of Gothic, found in [[Nevers Cathedral]] (1211\u20131331), [[Dijon Cathedral]] (1280\u20131325), and [[Chalon Cathedral]] (1220\u20131522). The Burgundian Gothic tended to be more sober and monumental than the more ornate northern style, and often included elements of earlier Romanesque churches on the same site.\n\nThe south of France had its own distinct variation of the Gothic style: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. A prominent example is [[Albi Cathedral]] in the [[Tarn Department]], built between 1282 and 1480. It was originally constructed as a fortress, then transformed into a church. Due to a lack of suitable stone, it was constructed almost entirely of brick, and is one of the largest brick buildings in the world. In the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins church]] of [[Toulouse]], the grafting of a single apse of polygonal plan on a church with two vessels gave birth to a starry vault whose complex organization anticipated more than a century on the Flamboyant Gothic. Tradition refers to this masterpiece as \"palm tree\" because the veins gush out of the smooth shaft of the column-like palm trees.<ref>https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1337/</ref>\n\n==Gothic civil architecture==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Fa\u00e7ade du Palais des Papes.jpg|The fa\u00e7ade of the [[Palais des Papes]] in [[Avignon]] (1252\u20131364)\nFile:Conciergerie Salle des gens d'armes 11.JPG|Gothic rib vaults of the hall of men at arms of the [[Conciergerie]] (1302)\nFile:Palais de la Cite.jpg|The [[Palais de la Cit\u00e9]] in Paris, which included the royal residence and [[Sainte-Chapelle]] (illuminated manuscript from 1412\u20131416)\nFile:Carillon Douai.jpg|Carillon of the H\u00f4tel de Ville of [[Douai]]\nFile:Bourges - Palais Jacques Coeur -722.jpg|Palace of [[Jacques C\u0153ur]] in [[Bourges]] (1440\u20131450)\nFile:Paris 2012-aout-0006-2-Hotel-de-Cluny.jpg|[[Mus\u00e9e de Cluny \u2013 Mus\u00e9e national du Moyen \u00c2ge]] in Paris (1334\u20131510)\nFile:VouteJSP-2.jpg|Flamboyant Gothic ceiling above the staircase in the [[Tour Jean-sans-Peur]] in Paris (1409\u20131411)\nFile:H\u00f4tel de ville de Compi\u00e8gne.jpg|H\u00f4tel de Ville of [[Compi\u00e8gne]] (15th century)\nFile:Stadhuis Saint Quentin.JPG|City Hall of [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne]] (1509)\n</gallery>\nThe largest civic building built in the Gothic style in France was the [[Palais des Papes]] (Palace of the Popes) in [[Avignon]], constructed between 1252 and 1364, when the Popes fled the political chaos and wars enveloping Rome. Given the complicated political situation, it combined the functions of a church, a seat of government and a fortress.\n\nIn the 15th century, following the Late Gothic or Flamboyant period, some elements of Gothic decoration borrowed from cathedrals began to appear in civil architecture, particularly in the region of [[Flanders]] in northern France, and in Paris. The H\u00f4tel de Ville of [[Compi\u00e8gne]] has an imposing Gothic bell tower, featuring a spire surrounded by smaller towers, and its windows are decorated with ornate [[Accolade (architecture)|accolade]]s or ornamental arches. Similarly, flamboyant town halls were found in [[Arras]], [[Douai]], and [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne]], and across the border in Belgium in [[Brussels]] and [[Bruges]]. Unfortunately, many of the finest buildings were destroyed during World War I, due to their proximity to the front lines.<ref>Ducher (1988), p. 64</ref>\n\nGothic features also appeared in the elaborate residences built by the nobility and wealthy bourgeoisie in Paris and other large cities. Examples include the [[H\u00f4tel Cluny]] (now the [[Mus\u00e9e de Cluny \u2013 Mus\u00e9e national du Moyen \u00c2ge]]  in Paris, and particularly the palatial house built by merchant [[Jacques C\u0153ur]] in [[Bourges]] (1440\u201350).  Another good example in Paris is the [[Tour Jean-sans-Peur]],  which features a Gothic watch tower and a flamboyant gothic ceiling.\n\n==Decline and transition==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nBeauvais Cathedral Exterior 1, Picardy, France - Diliff.jpg|Unfinished [[Beauvais Cathedral]] lacking a nave and spire (1225\u20131272)\nBeauvais fl\u00e8che.jpg|The spire of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] before its fall in 1573\nSt.-Eustache.jpg|[[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint Eustache]], a gothic plan with Renaissance decoration (1532\u20131632)\nFile:Church of St Eustace, Chapel of the Virgin Mary, Paris, France - Diliff.jpg|Chapel of the Virgin Mary in [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint Eustache]]\n</gallery>\nDuring the Middle Ages Prosperous French cities competed to build the largest cathedral or the highest tower. One of the drawbacks of French Gothic architecture was its immense cost; it required small armies of skilled craftsmen working intently for decades. Due to downturns in the economy, a notable number of French cathedrals were begun but never finished. They also sometimes suffered when the ambitions of the architects exceeded their technical skills. One example was [[Beauvais Cathedral]]. Its patrons and architects sought to build the tallest church in the world. with a vaulted choir 48 meters high, taller than its nearby competitor, [[Amiens Cathedral]], at 42 meters. Work began in 1225 but the roof of the vault was too heavy for the walls, and partially collapsed in 1272. They thickened the walls and rebuilt the vault and in 1569 they completed a tower, 72 meters high, which from 1569\u20131573 made Beauvais Cathedral the tallest structure in the world. However, in 1573, the new tower collapsed, fortunately without any casualties. The church remains today as it was, with the choir, some of the ambulatory, apse, some chapels, but no nave or tower.<ref>Philippe Bonnet-Laborderie, ''La Cath\u00e9drale de Beauvais: histoire et architecture'', La Mie-au-Roy, G.E.M.O.B., 1978.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 1530s, the style of French religious and civil architecture also began to show the influence of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. [[Charles VIII of France]] and [[Louis XII of France]] had both participated in military campaigns in Italy, and had seen the new architecture there. Large numbers of Italian stonemasons had come to Paris to work on the new [[Pont Notre-Dame]] (1507\u20131512) and other construction sites. The [[Fontaine des Innocents]], built by sculptor [[Jean Goujon]] to celebrate the entrance of Henry II into Paris in 1549, was the first Renaissance monument in the city.  It was soon followed by the new facade of the Cour Carr\u00e9 of the [[Louvre]], also decorated by [[Jean Goujon]]. The new Paris [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|Hotel de Ville]]  (1533\u20131568) was also constructed in an Italianate rather than Gothic style.  Most important of all, the new [[Tuileries Palace]] by [[Philippe Delorme]], built for [[Catherine de' Medici]], begun in 1564, was inspired by Italian palaces.<ref>Texier (2012) pp. 26\u201327)</ref>\n\nReligious buildings were slower to change. The Church of the Carmes-Deschauss\u00e9 (1613\u20131620) on rue Vaugirard in Paris, and especially the church of [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]] by [[Salomon de Brosse]] (1615\u201321) with a facade based on the superposition of the three orders of classical architecture, represented the new model. However, the Gothic style remained prominent in new churches.  The Church of [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint Eustache]] in Paris (1532\u20131640), which rivaled Notre-Dame in size, combined a Gothic plan with Renaissance decoration.\n\nIn the course of the 17th century, the French classical style of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mansart]] began to dominate; then, under Louis XIV, the grand French classical style, practiced by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], [[Louis Le Vau]], and [[Claude Perrault]], took center stage. Landmarks of the Gothic style, such as Notre-Dame, were modified with new interiors designed in the new style.  Following the new fashion of his patron, Louis XIV, the poet [[Moli\u00e8re]] ridiculed the Gothic style in a 1669 poem: \"...the insipid taste of Gothic ornamentation, these odious monstrosities of an ignorant age, produced by the torrents of barbarism...\".\n\nDuring the [[French Revolution]], Gothic churches were symbols of the old regime and became targets for the Revolutionaries;  the cathedrals were nationalized, and stripped of ornament and valuables.  The statues of the Biblical figures on the facade of Notre-Dame were beheaded, under the false belief that they were statues of the French Kings.  Under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], the cathedrals were returned to the church, but were left in a lamentable state of repair.\n\n==Military architecture==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chateau-de-Vincennes-donjon.jpg|Donjon of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]], begun 1337\nFile:Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry avril.jpg|The Chateau de Dourdon as it appeared in 1400, illustrated in ''Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry''\nDourdan walls gate.jpg|The [[Chateau de Dourdan]] today\nCarcasonneouterwall.jpg|Restored outer walls of the medieval [[Cit\u00e9 de Carcassonne]] (13th\u201314th century)\nFile:Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds vu depuis le Parc.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]], 19th-century completion of an unfinished medieval castle by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]]\n</gallery>\nIn the 13th century, the design of the ''chateau fort'', or castle, was modified, based on the Byzantine and Moslem castles the French knights had seen during the [[Crusades]]. The new kind of [[fortification]] was called Phillipienne, after [[Philippe Auguste]], who had taken part in the Crusades. The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main [[donjon]] or tower, in the center, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured.  The donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example.  It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.\n\nIn the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other.  The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''cr\u00e9neaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings (''[[merlon]]s'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''[[Machicolation|m\u00e2chicoulis]]''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''[[Bartizan|\u00e9chauguettes]]'' and ''[[bret\u00e8che]]s'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below. In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''[[Arrowslit|meurtri\u00e8res]]'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbal\u00e8tes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.<ref>Ducher (1988), pp. 66\u201367</ref>\n\nCastles were surrounded by deep [[moat]]s, spanned by a single drawbridge.  The entrance was also protected by a [[portcullis]], which could be opened and closed. The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers. One good surviving example is the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Dourdan]] in the Seine-et-Marne department, near [[Nemours]].<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 38</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the [[Hundred Years War]] (1337\u20131453), with improvements in artillery, the castles lost most of their military importance. They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants;  the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls. The tower of the Chateau of Vincennes became a royal residence.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 38</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, portions of the Gothic walls and towers of the [[Cit\u00e9 de Carcassonne]] were restored, with some modification,  by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]].  He also rebuilt the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]] (1393\u20131407), an unfinished medieval castle, making it into a neo-Gothic residence for [[Napoleon III]]. This project was incomplete when Napoleon III was overthrown in 1870, but can be visited today.\n\n==Restoration and Gothic revival==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:P1020476 Paris VII Basilique Saint-Clotilde rwk.JPG|[[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris]], by [[Th\u00e9odore Ballu]] (1841\u201357)\nP1300867 Paris X eglise St-Laurent rwk.jpg|[[Saint-Laurent, Paris]] by Simon-Claude-Constant Dufeux (1862\u201365).\nFile:Eglise Saint-Laurent (fronton).jpg|Neo-Gothic fronton of [[Saint-Laurent, Paris]]\nFile:Basilica of Saint Clotilde Sanctuary, Paris, France - Diliff.jpg|Sanctuary of Basilica of Saint-Laurent, Paris (1862\u201365)\nFile:Saint-Eug\u00e8ne, vue vers le choeur.JPG|[[\u00c9glise Saint-Eug\u00e8ne-Sainte-C\u00e9cile|Saint-Eugene-Sainte-C\u00e9cile]] (1854\u201355) featured a Gothic design with a modern iron framework\n</gallery>\nA large part of the Gothic architectural heritage of France, particularly the churches and monasteries, had been damaged or destroyed during the Revolution. Of the 300 churches in Paris in the 16th century, only 97 still were standing in 1800. The [[Basilica of St Denis]] had been stripped of its stained glass and monumental tombs, while the statues on the fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] had been beheaded and taken down. Throughout the country, churches and monasteries had been demolished or turned into barns, cafes, schools, or prisons. The first effort to catalogue the remaining monuments was made in 1816 by Alexandre de Laborde, who wrote the first list of \"Monuments of France\". In 1831, interest in Gothic architecture grew even greater following the huge popular success of the romantic novel ''[[Notre-Dame de Paris (novel)|Notre-Dame de Paris]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]]. In 1832, Hugo wrote an article for the ''[[Revue des deux Mondes]]'', which declared war against the \"massacre of ancient stones\" and the \"demolishers\" of France's past. Louis Philippe declared that restoration of churches and other monuments would be a priority of his regime. In October 1830, the position of Inspector of Historical Monuments had been created by the Interior Minister, [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]], a professor of history at the Sorbonne. In 1833, [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]] became its second Inspector, and by far the most energetic and long-lasting. He held the position for twenty-seven years.{{Sfn|Darcos|1998|pages=156\u2013159}}\n\nUnder Louis Philippe, French Gothic architecture was officially recognized as a treasure of French culture.  Under M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's direction, the first efforts to restore major Gothic monuments began. In 1835, the church of [[Saint-S\u00e9verin, Paris|Saint S\u00e9verin]] in Paris was among first to undergo restoration, followed in 1836 by [[Sainte-Chapelle]],  which had been turned into a storage house for government archives after the Revolution. The restoration of Saint-Chapelle as led by [[F\u00e9lix Duban]] with [[Jean-Baptiste Antoine Lassus]] and a young [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. In 1843, Lassus and Viollet-le-Duc won the competition for the restoration of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]].<ref>Darcos (1988), pp. 156\u20139</ref>  Over the rest of the 19th century, all of the major Gothic cathedrals of France underwent extensive restoration.\n\nFrench Gothic architecture also experienced a modest revival, largely confined to new churches. Neo-Gothic churches built in Paris included [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clothilde]] by [[Theodore Ballu]] (1841\u201357),  and [[Saint-Laurent, Paris]] by Simon-Claude-Constant Dufeux (1862\u201365).  Jean-Baptiste Lassus became the most prolific neo-Gothic architect in France, constructing Saint-Nicolas de Nantes (1840), Sacr\u00e9-Coeur de Moulins (1849), Saint-Pierre de Dijon (1850), Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Belleville (1853) and the \u00c9glise de Cusset (1855).{{sfn|Leniaud|2015}}  The [[\u00c9glise Saint-Eug\u00e8ne-Sainte-C\u00e9cile|Saint-Eugene-Sainte-C\u00e9cile]] in Paris by Louis-Auguste Boileau and Adrien-Louis Lasson (1854\u201355) was the most innovative example of neo-Gothic;  it combined a traditional Gothic design with a modern iron framework. [[Jules Verne]] was married in the church in 1857.<ref>Texier (2012), pp. 78\u201379</ref>\n\n==Sculpture and Symbolism - the \"Book for the Poor\"==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Notre-Dame Rzygacze.JPG|[[Gargoyles]] on the facade of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]\nFile:Gargoyle Point of View (3575829233).jpg|[[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] on the roof of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]\nFile:Alegor\u00eda de la alquimia en Notre-Dame.jpg|Allegory of alchemy, central portal, [[Notre Dame de Paris]]\nFile:Labyrinthchartres.jpg|[[Labyrinth]] of [[Chartres Cathedral]]\n</gallery>\nThe Gothic cathedral was a ''liber pauperum'', literally a \"book for the poor\", covered with sculpture illustrating biblical stories, for the vast majority of parishioners who were illiterate. These largely illustrated stories from the Bible, but also included stories and figures from mythology and more complicated symbols taken from medieval philosophical and scientific teachings such as [[alchemy]].\n\nThe exteriors of cathedrals and other Gothic churches were decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters. These included the [[gargoyle]], the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], the [[dragon]], the [[tarasque]], and others, taken largely from legend and mythology.  They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshippers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.<ref>Wenzler (2018), pp. 97\u201399</ref>\n\nThe gargoyle also had a more practical purpose.  They were the rain spouts of the Cathedral; rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses to the mouths of the gargoyles.  The longer the gargoyle, the farther the water was projected from the walls, protecting the walls and windows from water damage.  Multiple numbers were used to distribute the water as widely as possible.\n\nAmid all the religious figures, some of the sculptural decoration was devoted to illustrating medieval science and philosophy.  The porch of [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in Paris and of [[Amiens Cathedral]] are decorated with similar small carved figures holding circular plaques with symbols of transformation taken from alchemy.  The central pillar of the central door of Notre-Dame features a statue of a woman on a throne holding a sceptre in her left hand, and in her right hand, two books, one open (symbol of public knowledge), and the other closed (esoteric knowledge), along with a ladder with seven steps, symbolizing the seven steps alchemists followed in their scientific quest of trying to transform ordinary metal into gold.<ref>Wenzler (2018), pp. 97\u201399</ref>\n\nAnother common feature of Gothic cathedrals was a design of a [[labyrinth]], usually found in stone on the floor in a central part of the cathedral.  Inspired by the labyrinth in Greek legend constructed by King [[Minos]] as the home of the [[Minotaur]],  in cathedrals they were known as the \"Path of Jerusalem\" and symbolized the difficult and often roundabout path that a Christian sometimes had to follow in life to reach the gates of Paradise and salvation. Large labyrinths were originally found in [[Auxerre Cathedral]], [[Sens Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Arras Cathedral]], but these removed during various renovations in the 18th century.  The best surviving examples are in [[Chartres Cathedral]], in its original form,  and in [[Amiens Cathedral]], which was reconstructed in 1894.\n\nThe portal sculpture of [[Burgundy]] integrates classical literary elements with its 13th-century Gothic style.

The most notable examples are the great [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedrals of France, including [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], [[Chartres Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  Its main characteristics were the search for verticality, or height, and the innovative use of [[flying buttress]]es and other architectural innovations to distribute the weight of the stone structures to supports on the outside, allowing unprecedented height and volume,  The new techniques also permitted the addition of larger windows, including enormous stained glass windows, which filled the cathedrals with light.  The French style was widely copied in other parts of northern Europe, particularly Germany and England.  It was gradually supplanted as the dominant French style in the mid-16th century by [[French Renaissance architecture]].<ref>Ducher, Robert, ''Caract\u00e9ristique des Styles'' (1988), pp. 46\u201354</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nFrench Gothic architecture was the result of the emergence in the 12th century of powerful French state centered in the [[\u00cele-de-France]]. During the reign of [[Louis VI of France]] (1081\u20131137),  Paris was the principal residence of the Kings of France, [[Reims]]  the place of coronation, and the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]] became their ceremonial burial place. The Abbot of Saint-Denis, [[Suger]], was a counselor of Louis VI and Louis VII, as well as a historian.  He oversaw the reconstruction of the ambulatory of Saint-Denis, making it the first and most influential example of Gothic architecture in France.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 33</ref>\n\nOver the later course of the [[Capetian dynasty]] (1180 to 1328), three Kings: [[Philip Augustus]] (1180\u20131223), [[Louis IX of France]] (1226\u20131270), and [[Philip le Bel]] (1285\u20131314), established France as the major economic and political power on the Continent. The period also saw the founding of the University of Paris or [[Sorbonne]]. It produced the High Gothic and the [[Flamboyant|Flamboyant Gothic]] styles, and the construction of some of the most famous cathedrals, including [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), pp. 33\u201335</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Ceiling, Notre Dame, Paris, ZM.JPG|Six-part rib vaults of ceiling of Notre-Dame Cathedral\nFile:Voutes, nef, rosace ouest et grandes orgues de la cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame d'Amiens, France - 20080125-02.jpg|Four-part rib vaults at Amiens Cathedral allowed greater height and larger windows\nFile:Amiens Cath\u00e9drale Notre-dame arc-boutant sud-est 4.jpg|Flying buttresses of [[Amiens Cathedral]].

The rib vault was known in the earlier [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque period]], but it was not widely or effectively used until the Gothic period.  The crossed ribs of the vault carried the weight outwards and downwards, to clusters of supporting pillars and columns.  The earlier rib vaults, used at [[Sens Cathedral]] and [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]], had six compartments bordered by ribs and the crossing arch, which transferred the weight to alternating columns and pillars.  A new innovation appeared during the High Gothic: the four-part rib vault, which was used in [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Amiens Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]].  The ribs of this vault distributed the weight more equally to the four supporting pillars below and established a closer connection between the nave and the lower portions of the church walls, and between the arcades below and the windows above. This allowed for greater height and thinner walls and contributed to the strong impression of verticality given by the newer Cathedrals.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 34</ref>\n\n===The flying buttress===\nThe second major innovation of the Gothic style was the [[flying buttress]], which was first used at [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]]. This transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof outside the walls, where it was countered by the weight of the buttress.  Heavy stone [[pinnacle]]s were added to the top of the buttresses, to precisely counterbalance the thrust from inside the walls. The buttress allowed a significant reduction in the thickness of the cathedral walls, and permitted the use of larger windows in the interior of the church. In churches such as [[Sainte Chapelle]], thanks to buttresses, the walls were made almost entirely of stained glass.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 34</ref>\n\nThe development of rib-vaults and buttresses brought gradual changes to the interior structure of cathedrals. Early Gothic cathedrals had the walls of the nave built in four levels: a gallery with columns on the ground level; then the [[Tribune (architecture)#Meanings|tribune]], a gallery with windows; then the [[triforium]], a row of smaller windows; and finally the high windows, just below the vaults. During the High Gothic period, with the development of the four-part rib vault and the flying buttress, the tribune was eliminated at Chartres and other new cathedrals, allowing taller windows and arcades. By the 15th century, at Rouen Cathedral, the triforium also disappeared, and the walls between the traverses were filled with high windows.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), pp. 48\u201349</ref>\n\n===The portal and tympanum===\nAnother innovative feature of the French Gothic cathedral was the design of the [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] or entry, which by long Christian tradition faced west. The [[Basilica of St Denis]] had a triple portal, decorated with columns in the form of statues of apostles and saints around the doorways, and biblical scenes crowded with statuary over the doorways.  This triple portal was adopted by all the major cathedrals. A [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the portal, crowded with sculptural figures illustrating a biblical story became a feature of Gothic cathedrals. Following the example of Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal traditionally depicted the [[Last Judgement]], the right portal showed the coronation of the Virgin Mary, and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 35</ref>\n\n===Stained glass and the rose window===\n\nLarge [[stained glass]] windows and [[rose windows]] were another defining feature of the Gothic style.  Some Gothic windows, like those at Chartres, were cut into the stone walls. Other windows, such as those in the chapels of Notre-Dame and Reims, were in stone frames installed into the walls.  The most common form was an oculus, a small round window with two lancets, or windows with pointed arches, just below it.  The rose window was the most famous type of the Gothic style.  They were plead in the [[transept]]s and the portals to provide light to the nave. The largest rose windows were ten meters in diameter. They had a framework of stone armatures often in an ornate floral pattern, to help them resist the wind. Gothic windows were in a stone frame separate from the wall, not cut into the wall.\n\nThe early windows were made of pieces of tinted glass, touched up with [[grisaille]] painting, and held in place by pieces of lead that outlined the figures. As the windows grew larger, more intense colors were used. After 1260, the colors became lighter, and the combination of grisaille and pale shades of yellow became more common. [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Le Mans Cathedral]] have some of the finest surviving original windows.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 52</ref>\n\n==Sequence of Gothic styles==\nThe periods of French Gothic architecture are generally given as follows:<ref>Wenzler (2018), pp. 31\u201337</ref>\n\n* '''Early Gothic''' '''Transition''' or '''Primitive Gothic''' (1130\u20131230)\n* '''High Gothic''' or '''Classic Gothic''' (1230\u20131330)\n* '''[[Rayonnant]]'''  (14th century)\n* '''[[Flamboyant]]''' (15th century)\n* '''Late Gothic'''  (16th century)\n\nBecause of the lengthy period of construction of Gothic cathedrals, very few were built in a single style. Most, like Notre-Dame, have a combination of features constructed in several different periods, as well as features constructed after the Gothic age.\n\n==Early Gothic Style - Saint-Denis, Sens, Senlis, and Notre Dame==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Saint-Denis - Fa\u00e7ade.jpg|[[Basilica of Saint Denis]], west facade (1135\u201340)\nFile:Basilica Saint Denis ambulatory.JPG|Ambulatory of [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] (1135-40)\nFile:Interior of Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Sens-6974.jpg|Nave of [[Sens Cathedral]] (1140-1164)\nFile:Senlis Cathedral Nave, Picardy, France - Diliff.jpg|Nave of [[Senlis Cathedral]] (1153\u201391)\nFile:Gothic architecture of Notre Dame de Paris.jpg|Flying buttress at [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] (1163\u20131345)\n</gallery>\nThe birthplace of the new style was the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] in the [[\u00cele-de-France]], not far north of Paris where, in 1137, the [[Abb\u00e9 Suger]] began the reconstruction of the [[Carolingian]]-era abbey church. He began building a new structure with two towers to the west of the original church, and then from 1140 to 1144 began to reconstruct the old church. Most of his modifications were traditional, but he made one remarkable innovation; he decided to create a new [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] at the east end of the building, eliminating the traditional supporting walls of the old chapels, giving the interior a striking appearance of openness and greater height.<ref>Ducher, Robert, ''Caract\u00e9ristique des Styles'' (1988), pp. 46\u201354</ref>\n\nTo achieve his aims, Suger's masons drew on the several new elements which evolved or had been introduced to Romanesque architecture: the [[pointed arch]], the ribbed [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], the [[ambulatory]] with radiating chapels, and the columns wrapped in the ribs which supported the vaults. The builders constructed the walls of the church in four levels;  the [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]], whose two rows of columns received the ribs of the ceiling vaults; the tribune above it, a gallery which concealed the massive contreforts or buttresses which pressed against the walls; the [[triforium]], another, narrower gallery;  and, just below the ceiling, the ''claire-voie'' or [[clerestorey]], where the windows were located.  All of these features had existed in the Romanesque period, but it was the first time they had all been combined and the result differed dramatically from the previous Romanesque architecture.  Another innovation introduced by Suger was the use of columns in the form of statues of saints to decorate the portal of the church, adding a new element of verticality to the facade. This idea too was copied in new cathedrals.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 36</ref>\n\nThe new style quickly became known to the builders of new cathedrals.  The first cathedral built in the new style was  [[Sens Cathedral]], begun between 1135 and 1140 and consecrated in 1160.{{sfn|Mignon (2015|pp. 10-11}}<ref> ''Le Guide du Patrimoine de France'' (2002) pg. 53</ref>  It featured a Gothic choir, and six part rib vaults over the nave and collateral aisles, alternating pillars and doubled columns to support the vaults, and flying buttresses. {{Sfn|Mignon One of the builders of of Sens Cathedral, [[William of Sens]], later traveled to England and became the architect who reconstructed the choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] in the Gothic style. Sens was quickly followed by  [[Senlis Cathedral]] (begun 1160), and the most prominent of all, [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in Paris (begun 1160). Their builders abandoned the traditional plans and introduced the new Gothic elements.  The builders of Notre Dame went further by introducing the flying buttress, heavy columns of support outside the walls connected by arches to the walls, which received and counterbalanced the thrust from the rib vaults of the roof.  This allowed the builders to construct higher walls and larger windows.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 36</ref>\n\n==High Gothic Cathedrals - Chartres, Bourges, Reims, Amiens==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:20050921CathChartresB.jpg|[[Rose window]] and facade of [[Chartres Cathedral]] (1194\u20131220)\nFile:Chartres - Cath\u00e9drale 16.JPG|Choir of [[Chartres Cathedral]]\nFile:Cath\u00e9drale de Bourges (Cher).jpg|[[Bourges Cathedral]] with flying buttresses (1195\u20131230)\nFile:ReimsCathedral0116.jpg|[[Reims Cathedral]] from the northwest (1211\u20131345)\nFile:0 Amiens - Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame (1).JPG|Facade of [[Amiens Cathedral]] (1220\u20131266)\nFile:Amiens Cathedral choir Wikimedia Commons.jpg|[[Amiens Cathedral]] choir and altar\n</gallery>\nFrom the end of the 12th century until the middle of the 13th century, the Gothic style spread from the cathedrals in \u00cele-de-France to appear in other cities of northern France, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] (begun 1200); [[Bourges Cathedral]] (1195 to 1230), [[Reims Cathedral]] (1211\u20131275), and [[Amiens Cathedral]] (begun 1250);<ref>Ducher, ''Caract\u00e9ristique des Styles'' (1988), p. 48</ref> The characteristic Gothic elements were refined to make the new cathedrals taller, wider, and more full of light. At Chartres, the use of the flying buttresses allowed the elimination of the tribune level, which allowed much higher arcades and nave, and larger windows. The pillars were made of a central column surrounded by four more slender columns, which reached up to support the arches of the vaulted ceiling. The [[rib vault]] changed from six to four ribs, simpler and stronger. The [[flying buttress]]es at Amiens and Chartes were strengthened by an additional arch and with a supporting arcade, allowing even higher walls and more windows. At Reims, the buttresses were given greater weight and strength by the addition of heavy stone pinacles on top. These were often decorated with statues of angels, and became an important decorative element of the High Gothic style. Another practical and decorative element, the [[gargoyle]], appeared; it was an ornamental rain spout which channeled the water from the roof away from the building. At Amiens, the windows of the nave were made larger, and an additional row of clear glass windows (the ''claire-voie'') flooded the interior with light. The new structural technologies allowed the enlargement of the transepts and the choirs at the east end of the cathedrals, creating the space for a ring of well-lit chapels.<ref>Ducher, ''Caract\u00e9ristique des Styles'' (1988), p. 48</ref>\n\n==Rayonnant Gothic - Sainte-Chapelle and the rose windows of Notre-Dame==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Sainte Chapelle Interior Stained Glass.jpg|Windows of upper chapel of [[Sainte-Chapelle]] (1238\u201348)\nFile:SteChapelle von N.JPG|Columns of exterior framework supporting the windows of Sainte-Chapelle\nFile:North rose window of Notre-Dame de Paris, Aug 2010.jpg|Rose window in north transept of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]\nFile:Rose du transept Sud Notre-Dame de Paris 170208 04.jpg|Exterior of south rose window of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]]\n</gallery>\nThe next period of French Gothic architecture, from the second half of the 13th century until the 1370s, was termed ''Rayonnant'' (\"Radiant\"), describing the tendency toward the use of more and more stained glass and less masonry in the design of the structure, until the walls seemed entirely made of glass.  The most celebrated example was the chapel of [[Sainte-Chapelle]], attached to the royal residence on the [[Palais de la Cit\u00e9]].  An elaborate system of exterior columns and arches reduced the walls of the upper chapel to a thin framework for the enormous windows. The weight of each of the masonry gables above the [[archivolt]] of the windows also helped the walls to resist the thrust and to distribute the weight.<ref>Ducher (1988), p. 58</ref>\n\nAnother landmark of the Rayonnant Gothic are the two rose windows on the north and south of the transept of [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]], whereas earlier rose windows, like those of [[Amiens Cathedral]], were framed by stone and occupied only a portion of the wall, these two windows, with a delicate lacelike framework, occupied the entire space between the pillars.<ref>Ducher (1988), p. 58</ref>\n\n==Flamboyant Gothic - Rouen Cathedral, Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nCath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Rouen - panoramio (1).jpg|West facade, [[Rouen Cathedral]]\nParis Sainte Chapelle du Chateau de Vincennes ancienne demeure royale Vers le Bois de Vincennes en France angle 3.JPG|The west front of [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] (1370s)\nInterior of Sainte Chapelle, Vincennes 140308 1.jpg|The nave of [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]]\nRose Window of Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes, Interior View 140308 1.jpg|The rose window [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]].  The sinuous lines of the window frame gave the style the name \"Flamboyant\".\nInterieur abbaye.jpg|Choir of [[Mont Saint Michel Abbey]] (about 1448)\n</gallery>\nThe Flamboyant Gothic style appeared in the second half of the 14th century. Its characteristic features were more exuberant decoration, as the nobles and wealthy citizens of mostly northern French cities competed to build more and more elaborate churches and cathedrals. It took its name from the sinuous, flame-like designs which ornamented windows. Other new features included the ''arc en accolade'', a window decorated with an arch, stone pinnacles and floral sculpture. It also featured an increase in the number of ''nervures'', or ribs, that supported and decorated each vault of the ceiling, both for greater support and decorative effect.  Notable examples of Flamboyant Gothic include the western facade of [[Rouen Cathedral]] and [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] in Paris, both built in the 1370s; and the Choir of [[Mont Saint Michel Abbey]] (about 1448).<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 37</ref>\n\n==Religious architecture in the French regions==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nHopital-St-Jean-Angers (3).JPG|Angevin Gothic vaults and columns in the Hopital-St-Jean in [[Angers]]\nVo\u00fbte angevine dite Plantagen\u00eat de l'Eglise du Puy-Notre-Dame DSC 1856.jpg|Angevin Gothic vault of the Church of Puy-Notre Dame\nCath\u00e9drale St B\u00e9nigne - Dijon.jpg|West facade of [[Dijon Cathedral]] in [[Burgundy]] (1280\u20131325)\nFile:Interior - Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Vincent de Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne - DSC06108.JPG|Nave of [[Chalon Cathedral]] in [[Burgundy]] (1220\u20131522)\nFile:Poitiers Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre AL1.jpg|Facade of [[Poitiers Cathedral]] (1155\u20131379)\nFile:085 Nevers Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Cyr-et-Sainte-Julitte Vue int\u00e9rieure.jpg|Choir of [[Nevers Cathedral]] (1211\u20131331)\nFile:Albi Sainte-C\u00e9cile.JPG|[[Albi Cathedral]] in southwest France (1282\u20131480), built of brick\nFile:Nave of the Ste C\u00e9cile Cathedral - 2014-02-22.jpg|Polychrome nave of [[Albi Cathedral]] (1282\u20131480)\nPalmier des Jacobins.JPG|The Palm Tree of the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins church]] ([[Toulouse]], circa 1292)\n</gallery>\nThe most famous examples of Gothic architecture are found in the [[\u00cele-de-France]] and [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], but other French regions created their own original versions of the style. The Angevin Gothic style in the province of [[Anjou]] features vaults with elegant decorative ribs, as well as very ornate columns.  The style is found in the interior of [[Angers Cathedral]] (1032\u20131523), though many of the Gothic elements of the facade were replaced with Renaissance elements and towers. A very fine example of Angevin Gothic is found in the medieval Saint Jean Hospital in Angers, which now contains the Mus\u00e9e Jean-Lur\u00e7at, a museum of contemporary tapestries.<ref>Ducher (1988) p. 62</ref>\n\n[[Poitiers Cathedral]] in the historic province of [[Maine (province)|Maine]] also features a distinctive regional Gothic style. It was begun in 1162 under King [[Henry II of England]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. Its distinctive features, like those of Angevin Gothic, include convex vaults with ribs in decorative designs.<ref>Ducher (1988) p. 62</ref>\n\nBurgundy also had its own version of Gothic, found in [[Nevers Cathedral]] (1211\u20131331), [[Dijon Cathedral]] (1280\u20131325), and [[Chalon Cathedral]] (1220\u20131522). The Burgundian Gothic tended to be more sober and monumental than the more ornate northern style, and often included elements of earlier Romanesque churches on the same site.\n\nThe south of France had its own distinct variation of the Gothic style: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. A prominent example is [[Albi Cathedral]] in the [[Tarn Department]], built between 1282 and 1480. It was originally constructed as a fortress, then transformed into a church. Due to a lack of suitable stone, it was constructed almost entirely of brick, and is one of the largest brick buildings in the world. In the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins church]] of [[Toulouse]], the grafting of a single apse of polygonal plan on a church with two vessels gave birth to a starry vault whose complex organization anticipated more than a century on the Flamboyant Gothic. Tradition refers to this masterpiece as \"palm tree\" because the veins gush out of the smooth shaft of the column-like palm trees.<ref>https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1337/</ref>\n\n==Gothic civil architecture==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Fa\u00e7ade du Palais des Papes.jpg|The fa\u00e7ade of the [[Palais des Papes]] in [[Avignon]] (1252\u20131364)\nFile:Conciergerie Salle des gens d'armes 11.JPG|Gothic rib vaults of the hall of men at arms of the [[Conciergerie]] (1302)\nFile:Palais de la Cite.jpg|The [[Palais de la Cit\u00e9]] in Paris, which included the royal residence and [[Sainte-Chapelle]] (illuminated manuscript from 1412\u20131416)\nFile:Carillon Douai.jpg|Carillon of the H\u00f4tel de Ville of [[Douai]]\nFile:Bourges - Palais Jacques Coeur -722.jpg|Palace of [[Jacques C\u0153ur]] in [[Bourges]] (1440\u20131450)\nFile:Paris 2012-aout-0006-2-Hotel-de-Cluny.jpg|[[Mus\u00e9e de Cluny \u2013 Mus\u00e9e national du Moyen \u00c2ge]] in Paris (1334\u20131510)\nFile:VouteJSP-2.jpg|Flamboyant Gothic ceiling above the staircase in the [[Tour Jean-sans-Peur]] in Paris (1409\u20131411)\nFile:H\u00f4tel de ville de Compi\u00e8gne.jpg|H\u00f4tel de Ville of [[Compi\u00e8gne]] (15th century)\nFile:Stadhuis Saint Quentin.JPG|City Hall of [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne]] (1509)\n</gallery>\nThe largest civic building built in the Gothic style in France was the [[Palais des Papes]] (Palace of the Popes) in [[Avignon]], constructed between 1252 and 1364, when the Popes fled the political chaos and wars enveloping Rome. Given the complicated political situation, it combined the functions of a church, a seat of government and a fortress.\n\nIn the 15th century, following the Late Gothic or Flamboyant period, some elements of Gothic decoration borrowed from cathedrals began to appear in civil architecture, particularly in the region of [[Flanders]] in northern France, and in Paris. The H\u00f4tel de Ville of [[Compi\u00e8gne]] has an imposing Gothic bell tower, featuring a spire surrounded by smaller towers, and its windows are decorated with ornate [[Accolade (architecture)|accolade]]s or ornamental arches. Similarly, flamboyant town halls were found in [[Arras]], [[Douai]], and [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne]], and across the border in Belgium in [[Brussels]] and [[Bruges]]. Unfortunately, many of the finest buildings were destroyed during World War I, due to their proximity to the front lines.<ref>Ducher (1988), p. 64</ref>\n\nGothic features also appeared in the elaborate residences built by the nobility and wealthy bourgeoisie in Paris and other large cities. Examples include the [[H\u00f4tel Cluny]] (now the [[Mus\u00e9e de Cluny \u2013 Mus\u00e9e national du Moyen \u00c2ge]]  in Paris, and particularly the palatial house built by merchant [[Jacques C\u0153ur]] in [[Bourges]] (1440\u201350).  Another good example in Paris is the [[Tour Jean-sans-Peur]],  which features a Gothic watch tower and a flamboyant gothic ceiling.\n\n==Decline and transition==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nBeauvais Cathedral Exterior 1, Picardy, France - Diliff.jpg|Unfinished [[Beauvais Cathedral]] lacking a nave and spire (1225\u20131272)\nBeauvais fl\u00e8che.jpg|The spire of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] before its fall in 1573\nSt.-Eustache.jpg|[[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint Eustache]], a gothic plan with Renaissance decoration (1532\u20131632)\nFile:Church of St Eustace, Chapel of the Virgin Mary, Paris, France - Diliff.jpg|Chapel of the Virgin Mary in [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint Eustache]]\n</gallery>\nDuring the Middle Ages Prosperous French cities competed to build the largest cathedral or the highest tower. One of the drawbacks of French Gothic architecture was its immense cost; it required small armies of skilled craftsmen working intently for decades. Due to downturns in the economy, a notable number of French cathedrals were begun but never finished. They also sometimes suffered when the ambitions of the architects exceeded their technical skills. One example was [[Beauvais Cathedral]]. Its patrons and architects sought to build the tallest church in the world. with a vaulted choir 48 meters high, taller than its nearby competitor, [[Amiens Cathedral]], at 42 meters. Work began in 1225 but the roof of the vault was too heavy for the walls, and partially collapsed in 1272. They thickened the walls and rebuilt the vault and in 1569 they completed a tower, 72 meters high, which from 1569\u20131573 made Beauvais Cathedral the tallest structure in the world. However, in 1573, the new tower collapsed, fortunately without any casualties. The church remains today as it was, with the choir, some of the ambulatory, apse, some chapels, but no nave or tower.<ref>Philippe Bonnet-Laborderie, ''La Cath\u00e9drale de Beauvais: histoire et architecture'', La Mie-au-Roy, G.E.M.O.B., 1978.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 1530s, the style of French religious and civil architecture also began to show the influence of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. [[Charles VIII of France]] and [[Louis XII of France]] had both participated in military campaigns in Italy, and had seen the new architecture there. Large numbers of Italian stonemasons had come to Paris to work on the new [[Pont Notre-Dame]] (1507\u20131512) and other construction sites. The [[Fontaine des Innocents]], built by sculptor [[Jean Goujon]] to celebrate the entrance of Henry II into Paris in 1549, was the first Renaissance monument in the city.  It was soon followed by the new facade of the Cour Carr\u00e9 of the [[Louvre]], also decorated by [[Jean Goujon]]. The new Paris [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|Hotel de Ville]]  (1533\u20131568) was also constructed in an Italianate rather than Gothic style.  Most important of all, the new [[Tuileries Palace]] by [[Philippe Delorme]], built for [[Catherine de' Medici]], begun in 1564, was inspired by Italian palaces.<ref>Texier (2012) pp. 26\u201327)</ref>\n\nReligious buildings were slower to change. The Church of the Carmes-Deschauss\u00e9 (1613\u20131620) on rue Vaugirard in Paris, and especially the church of [[St-Gervais-et-St-Protais]] by [[Salomon de Brosse]] (1615\u201321) with a facade based on the superposition of the three orders of classical architecture, represented the new model. However, the Gothic style remained prominent in new churches.  The Church of [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint Eustache]] in Paris (1532\u20131640), which rivaled Notre-Dame in size, combined a Gothic plan with Renaissance decoration.\n\nIn the course of the 17th century, the French classical style of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mansart]] began to dominate; then, under Louis XIV, the grand French classical style, practiced by [[Jules Hardouin-Mansart]], [[Louis Le Vau]], and [[Claude Perrault]], took center stage. Landmarks of the Gothic style, such as Notre-Dame, were modified with new interiors designed in the new style.  Following the new fashion of his patron, Louis XIV, the poet [[Moli\u00e8re]] ridiculed the Gothic style in a 1669 poem: \"...the insipid taste of Gothic ornamentation, these odious monstrosities of an ignorant age, produced by the torrents of barbarism...\".\n\nDuring the [[French Revolution]], Gothic churches were symbols of the old regime and became targets for the Revolutionaries;  the cathedrals were nationalized, and stripped of ornament and valuables.  The statues of the Biblical figures on the facade of Notre-Dame were beheaded, under the false belief that they were statues of the French Kings.  Under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], the cathedrals were returned to the church, but were left in a lamentable state of repair.\n\n==Military architecture==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Chateau-de-Vincennes-donjon.jpg|Donjon of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]], begun 1337\nFile:Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry avril.jpg|The Chateau de Dourdon as it appeared in 1400, illustrated in ''Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry''\nDourdan walls gate.jpg|The [[Chateau de Dourdan]] today\nCarcasonneouterwall.jpg|Restored outer walls of the medieval [[Cit\u00e9 de Carcassonne]] (13th\u201314th century)\nFile:Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds vu depuis le Parc.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]], 19th-century completion of an unfinished medieval castle by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]]\n</gallery>\nIn the 13th century, the design of the ''chateau fort'', or castle, was modified, based on the Byzantine and Moslem castles the French knights had seen during the [[Crusades]]. The new kind of [[fortification]] was called Phillipienne, after [[Philippe Auguste]], who had taken part in the Crusades. The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main [[donjon]] or tower, in the center, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured.  The donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example.  It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.\n\nIn the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other.  The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''cr\u00e9neaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings (''[[merlon]]s'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''[[Machicolation|m\u00e2chicoulis]]''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''[[Bartizan|\u00e9chauguettes]]'' and ''[[bret\u00e8che]]s'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below. In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''[[Arrowslit|meurtri\u00e8res]]'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbal\u00e8tes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.<ref>Ducher (1988), pp. 66\u201367</ref>\n\nCastles were surrounded by deep [[moat]]s, spanned by a single drawbridge.  The entrance was also protected by a [[portcullis]], which could be opened and closed. The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers. One good surviving example is the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Dourdan]] in the Seine-et-Marne department, near [[Nemours]].<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 38</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the [[Hundred Years War]] (1337\u20131453), with improvements in artillery, the castles lost most of their military importance. They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants;  the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls. The tower of the Chateau of Vincennes became a royal residence.<ref>Renault and Laz\u00e9 (2006), p. 38</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, portions of the Gothic walls and towers of the [[Cit\u00e9 de Carcassonne]] were restored, with some modification,  by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]].  He also rebuilt the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]] (1393\u20131407), an unfinished medieval castle, making it into a neo-Gothic residence for [[Napoleon III]]. This project was incomplete when Napoleon III was overthrown in 1870, but can be visited today.\n\n==Restoration and Gothic revival==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:P1020476 Paris VII Basilique Saint-Clotilde rwk.JPG|[[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris]], by [[Th\u00e9odore Ballu]] (1841\u201357)\nP1300867 Paris X eglise St-Laurent rwk.jpg|[[Saint-Laurent, Paris]] by Simon-Claude-Constant Dufeux (1862\u201365).\nFile:Eglise Saint-Laurent (fronton).jpg|Neo-Gothic fronton of [[Saint-Laurent, Paris]]\nFile:Basilica of Saint Clotilde Sanctuary, Paris, France - Diliff.jpg|Sanctuary of Basilica of Saint-Laurent, Paris (1862\u201365)\nFile:Saint-Eug\u00e8ne, vue vers le choeur.JPG|[[\u00c9glise Saint-Eug\u00e8ne-Sainte-C\u00e9cile|Saint-Eugene-Sainte-C\u00e9cile]] (1854\u201355) featured a Gothic design with a modern iron framework\n</gallery>\nA large part of the Gothic architectural heritage of France, particularly the churches and monasteries, had been damaged or destroyed during the Revolution. Of the 300 churches in Paris in the 16th century, only 97 still were standing in 1800. The [[Basilica of St Denis]] had been stripped of its stained glass and monumental tombs, while the statues on the fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] had been beheaded and taken down. Throughout the country, churches and monasteries had been demolished or turned into barns, cafes, schools, or prisons. The first effort to catalogue the remaining monuments was made in 1816 by Alexandre de Laborde, who wrote the first list of \"Monuments of France\". In 1831, interest in Gothic architecture grew even greater following the huge popular success of the romantic novel ''[[Notre-Dame de Paris (novel)|Notre-Dame de Paris]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]]. In 1832, Hugo wrote an article for the ''[[Revue des deux Mondes]]'', which declared war against the \"massacre of ancient stones\" and the \"demolishers\" of France's past. Louis Philippe declared that restoration of churches and other monuments would be a priority of his regime. In October 1830, the position of Inspector of Historical Monuments had been created by the Interior Minister, [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]], a professor of history at the Sorbonne. In 1833, [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]] became its second Inspector, and by far the most energetic and long-lasting. He held the position for twenty-seven years.{{Sfn|Darcos|1998|pages=156\u2013159}}\n\nUnder Louis Philippe, French Gothic architecture was officially recognized as a treasure of French culture.  Under M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's direction, the first efforts to restore major Gothic monuments began. In 1835, the church of [[Saint-S\u00e9verin, Paris|Saint S\u00e9verin]] in Paris was among first to undergo restoration, followed in 1836 by [[Sainte-Chapelle]],  which had been turned into a storage house for government archives after the Revolution. The restoration of Saint-Chapelle as led by [[F\u00e9lix Duban]] with [[Jean-Baptiste Antoine Lassus]] and a young [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc]]. In 1843, Lassus and Viollet-le-Duc won the competition for the restoration of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]].<ref>Darcos (1988), pp. 156\u20139</ref>  Over the rest of the 19th century, all of the major Gothic cathedrals of France underwent extensive restoration.\n\nFrench Gothic architecture also experienced a modest revival, largely confined to new churches. Neo-Gothic churches built in Paris included [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clothilde]] by [[Theodore Ballu]] (1841\u201357),  and [[Saint-Laurent, Paris]] by Simon-Claude-Constant Dufeux (1862\u201365).  Jean-Baptiste Lassus became the most prolific neo-Gothic architect in France, constructing Saint-Nicolas de Nantes (1840), Sacr\u00e9-Coeur de Moulins (1849), Saint-Pierre de Dijon (1850), Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Belleville (1853) and the \u00c9glise de Cusset (1855).{{sfn|Leniaud|2015}}  The [[\u00c9glise Saint-Eug\u00e8ne-Sainte-C\u00e9cile|Saint-Eugene-Sainte-C\u00e9cile]] in Paris by Louis-Auguste Boileau and Adrien-Louis Lasson (1854\u201355) was the most innovative example of neo-Gothic;  it combined a traditional Gothic design with a modern iron framework. [[Jules Verne]] was married in the church in 1857.<ref>Texier (2012), pp. 78\u201379</ref>\n\n==Sculpture and Symbolism - the \"Book for the Poor\"==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Notre-Dame Rzygacze.JPG|[[Gargoyles]] on the facade of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]\nFile:Gargoyle Point of View (3575829233).jpg|[[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] on the roof of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]\nFile:Alegor\u00eda de la alquimia en Notre-Dame.jpg|Allegory of alchemy, central portal, [[Notre Dame de Paris]]\nFile:Labyrinthchartres.jpg|[[Labyrinth]] of [[Chartres Cathedral]]\n</gallery>\nThe Gothic cathedral was a ''liber pauperum'', literally a \"book for the poor\", covered with sculpture illustrating biblical stories, for the vast majority of parishioners who were illiterate. These largely illustrated stories from the Bible, but also included stories and figures from mythology and more complicated symbols taken from medieval philosophical and scientific teachings such as [[alchemy]].\n\nThe exteriors of cathedrals and other Gothic churches were decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters. These included the [[gargoyle]], the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], the [[dragon]], the [[tarasque]], and others, taken largely from legend and mythology.  They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshippers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.<ref>Wenzler (2018), pp. 97\u201399</ref>\n\nThe gargoyle also had a more practical purpose.  They were the rain spouts of the Cathedral; rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses to the mouths of the gargoyles.  The longer the gargoyle, the farther the water was projected from the walls, protecting the walls and windows from water damage.  Multiple numbers were used to distribute the water as widely as possible.\n\nAmid all the religious figures, some of the sculptural decoration was devoted to illustrating medieval science and philosophy.  The porch of [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in Paris and of [[Amiens Cathedral]] are decorated with similar small carved figures holding circular plaques with symbols of transformation taken from alchemy.  The central pillar of the central door of Notre-Dame features a statue of a woman on a throne holding a sceptre in her left hand, and in her right hand, two books, one open (symbol of public knowledge), and the other closed (esoteric knowledge), along with a ladder with seven steps, symbolizing the seven steps alchemists followed in their scientific quest of trying to transform ordinary metal into gold.<ref>Wenzler (2018), pp. 97\u201399</ref>\n\nAnother common feature of Gothic cathedrals was a design of a [[labyrinth]], usually found in stone on the floor in a central part of the cathedral.  Inspired by the labyrinth in Greek legend constructed by King [[Minos]] as the home of the [[Minotaur]],  in cathedrals they were known as the \"Path of Jerusalem\" and symbolized the difficult and often roundabout path that a Christian sometimes had to follow in life to reach the gates of Paradise and salvation. Large labyrinths were originally found in [[Auxerre Cathedral]], [[Sens Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Arras Cathedral]], but these removed during various renovations in the 18th century.  The best surviving examples are in [[Chartres Cathedral]], in its original form,  and in [[Amiens Cathedral]], which was reconstructed in 1894.\n\nThe portal sculpture of [[Burgundy]] integrates classical literary elements with its 13th-century Gothic style. In [[Auxerre]], two such examples of sculptures are upon the cathedral of [[Saint-\u00c9tienne]] depicting [[Hercules]], a satyr, and a sleeping faun; the Chartres\u2013[[Reims]] cathedral's north transept illustrates the biblical tale of [[David]] and [[Bathsheba]]. The [[Sens Cathedral]]'s \"Coronation of the Virgin\" reflects a similar relief cathedral on the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in Paris, and was created in a workshop that made minor contributions to [[Spanish Gothic architecture]]<ref>Williamson, Paul. \"Gothic Sculpture 1140\u20131300\". {{ISBN|978-0300074529}}</ref>\n\n==Notable structures==\nEarly Gothic:\n* The east end of the [[Abbey Church of St Denis]] (begun 1135)\n* [[Noyon Cathedral]] (1145\u20131235)\n* [[Sens Cathedral]] (1135\u20131534)\n* [[Lyon Cathedral]]\n* [[Toul Cathedral]]\n* The west fa\u00e7ade of [[Chartres Cathedral]]\n* [[Notre-Dame de Paris]] (started 1163)\n* [[Notre-Dame of Laon]] (1160\u20131230)\n\nHigh Gothic:\n* The main body of [[Chartres Cathedral]] (1194\u20131260)\n* [[Amiens Cathedral]] (nave constructed 1220\u20131269)\n* [[Notre-Dame de Paris]]\n* [[Bourges Cathedral]]\n\nRayonnant:\n* The nave of the [[Abbey Church of St Denis]]\n* [[Reims Cathedral]]\n* [[Sainte-Chapelle]]\n\nLate Gothic (Flamboyant):\n* The north tower of [[Chartres Cathedral]]\n* The [[rose window]] of [[Amiens Cathedral]]\n* The west facade of [[Rouen Cathedral]]\n* [[Church of Saint-Maclou]], [[Rouen]].\n* The north fa\u00e7ade, south fa\u00e7ade, and south porch of the [[Church of Notre-Dame de Louviers]]\n* The south transept of [[Beauvais Cathedral]]\n* Notre-Dame de [[Caudebec-en-Caux]]\n* The north transept of [[\u00c9vreux Cathedral]]\n* [[Notre-Dame de l'\u00c9pine]]\n\nIn addition to these Gothic styles, there is another style called \"Gothique m\u00e9ridional\", Southern Gothic, as opposed to Gothique septentrional, Northern Gothic. This style is characterized by a large nave, and has no transept.

The film was produced by [[A. V. Meiyappan]], [[M. Saravanan (film producer)|M. Saravanan]], M. Kumaran and M. Murugan under [[AVM Productions]]. It stars [[Sivaji Ganesan]] and [[Sowcar Janaki]] in the lead roles, while [[S. A. Ashokan]], [[Major Sundarrajan]], [[Vanisri]] and [[Sivakumar]] play pivotal roles. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by [[M. S. Viswanathan]], while the lyrics for the songs were written by [[Vaali (poet)|Vaali]].\n\nIn addition to being Sivaji Ganesan's 125th&nbsp;film, ''Uyarndha Manithan'' was conceived as an adaptation of the 1966 [[Bengali language|Bengali]] film ''[[Uttar Purush]]''. The plot revolves around a wealthy industrialist's son who secretly marries the daughter of his family estate's accountant, only for his father to discover it and burn down the estate along with his son's pregnant wife, who is inside. The remainder of the film reveals the truth behind how she and her progeny survive.\n\nReleased on 29 November 1968, ''Uyarndha Manithan'' went on to become a commercial success, with a theatrical run of over 125 days. The film won the [[National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer]] at the [[16th National Film Awards]] for [[P. Susheela]] for the song \"Paal Polave\", making her the inaugural recipient of that category. It also won four [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]], including [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Film|Best Film]] (First prize) and [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Krishnan\u2013Panju.\n\n== Plot ==\nRajalingam alias Raju is the son of a wealthy [[Madurai]]-based industrialist, Sankaralingam. Living with Raju is his driver and friend, Sundaram. While vacationing in his family estate at [[Kodaikanal]] with Sundaram and his family doctor, Gopal, Raju meets a woman named Parvathi and falls in love with her. Gopal too becomes smitten with Parvathi when he meets her whilst conducting her father's  medical treatment. Parvathi, who knows Raju through her father, as he is also an accountant of Raju's family estate, reciprocates Raju's feelings. Gopal decides not to reveal his love for Parvathi to Raju for Raju's sake. Raju and Parvathi marry in secret with the help of Gopal and the consent of Parvathi's father. The couple lives together in Kodaikanal without disclosing the knowledge of their marriage to Raju's father, Sankaralingam.\n\nThree months later, Parvathi becomes pregnant. Sankaralingam, fearing for his son's safety, arrives at Kodaikanal and becomes furious upon finding out Raju's marriage to Parvathi. He orders his henchmen to set the estate on fire with Parvathi and her father inside. Raju and Gopal rush to save Parvathi, but they are stopped by Sankaralingam's henchmen and are forcefully taken back to Madurai, leaving Parvathi and her father for dead. A few months after returning to Madurai, Raju is forced to marry his cousin Vimala. After the marriage, Sankaralingam hands over his business affairs to Raju and dies. Nineteen years pass. Despite having the mutual affection for each other, Raju and Vimala remain childless and Raju is unable to forget Parvathi.\n\nSathyamurthy, a nineteen-year-old who lives with his uncle Murugan, is unable to retain any job due to his honest nature. He becomes acquainted with Gopal, with whose recommendation he becomes Raju's personal house servant. When Sathyamurthy displays his mother's photograph at his house to pray for her, it is revealed that Sathyamurthy is the son of Raju and Parvathi. Parvathi had survived the accident, was cared for by Murugan and died a few years after giving birth to Sathyamurthy without divulging the identity of Raju to Sathyamurthy and Murugan. Sathyamurthy improves his reading and writing skills with the help of Sundaram's daughter, Gowri and the two fall in love. When Raju learns of their love, he approves of their marriage. Gopal comes to know that Sathyamurthy is Raju's son, but dies of a sudden heart attack before revealing it.\n\nJealous of Sathya Murthy's influence on Raju, Rathnam and his wife hide Vimala's diamond necklace in Sathyamurthy's suitcase in an effort to get rid of him. Vimala, upset at losing her necklace, searches the house for it. When Raju, Sundaram, Gowri, and Sathyamurthy return after attending a conference in Kodaikanal, Vimala, acting on Rathnam's provocation, orders that Sathyamurthy's suitcase is searched. When the necklace is found in it, Raju throws Sathyamurthy out of his house, despite Sathyamurthy proclaiming his innocence. Gowri then shows Parvathi's photograph to Raju, who is shocked to learn that Sathyamurthy is his own son. Raju reveals the truth about Parvathi to Vimala, who also accepts Sathyamurthy as her son. Before Raju and Vimala rush to bring Sathyamurthy back, Raju learns of a fire breaking out in one of his mills. Sathyamurthy, unhappy of being wrongly accused by Raju, attempts suicide by entering the burning mill. Raju saves Sathyamurthy in time and reveals the truth about his birth to him. The family is united and Sathyamurthy marries Gowri.\n\n== Cast ==\nAdapted from the opening credits:<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=Uyarndha Manithan |type=motion picture |language=ta |publisher=[[AVM Productions]] |year=1968 |time=0:00 to 2:08 |time-caption=Opening credits, from}}</ref>\n* [[Sivaji Ganesan]] as Rajalingam \"Raju\"\n* [[Sowcar Janaki]] as Vimala\n* [[S.

The film was produced by [[A. V. Meiyappan]], [[M. Saravanan (film producer)|M. Saravanan]], M. Kumaran and M. Murugan under [[AVM Productions]]. It stars [[Sivaji Ganesan]] and [[Sowcar Janaki]] in the lead roles, while [[S. A. Ashokan]], [[Major Sundarrajan]], [[Vanisri]] and [[Sivakumar]] play pivotal roles. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by [[M. S. Viswanathan]], while the lyrics for the songs were written by [[Vaali (poet)|Vaali]].\n\nIn addition to being Sivaji Ganesan's 125th&nbsp;film, ''Uyarndha Manithan'' was conceived as an adaptation of the 1966 [[Bengali language|Bengali]] film ''[[Uttar Purush]]''. The plot revolves around a wealthy industrialist's son who secretly marries the daughter of his family estate's accountant, only for his father to discover it and burn down the estate along with his son's pregnant wife, who is inside. The remainder of the film reveals the truth behind how she and her progeny survive.\n\nReleased on 29 November 1968, ''Uyarndha Manithan'' went on to become a commercial success, with a theatrical run of over 125 days. The film won the [[National Film Award for Best Female Playback Singer]] at the [[16th National Film Awards]] for [[P. Susheela]] for the song \"Paal Polave\", making her the inaugural recipient of that category. It also won four [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards]], including [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Film|Best Film]] (First prize) and [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Krishnan\u2013Panju.\n\n== Plot ==\nRajalingam alias Raju is the son of a wealthy [[Madurai]]-based industrialist, Sankaralingam. Living with Raju is his driver and friend, Sundaram. While vacationing in his family estate at [[Kodaikanal]] with Sundaram and his family doctor, Gopal, Raju meets a woman named Parvathi and falls in love with her. Gopal too becomes smitten with Parvathi when he meets her whilst conducting her father's  medical treatment. Parvathi, who knows Raju through her father, as he is also an accountant of Raju's family estate, reciprocates Raju's feelings. Gopal decides not to reveal his love for Parvathi to Raju for Raju's sake. Raju and Parvathi marry in secret with the help of Gopal and the consent of Parvathi's father. The couple lives together in Kodaikanal without disclosing the knowledge of their marriage to Raju's father, Sankaralingam.\n\nThree months later, Parvathi becomes pregnant. Sankaralingam, fearing for his son's safety, arrives at Kodaikanal and becomes furious upon finding out Raju's marriage to Parvathi. He orders his henchmen to set the estate on fire with Parvathi and her father inside. Raju and Gopal rush to save Parvathi, but they are stopped by Sankaralingam's henchmen and are forcefully taken back to Madurai, leaving Parvathi and her father for dead. A few months after returning to Madurai, Raju is forced to marry his cousin Vimala. After the marriage, Sankaralingam hands over his business affairs to Raju and dies. Nineteen years pass. Despite having the mutual affection for each other, Raju and Vimala remain childless and Raju is unable to forget Parvathi.\n\nSathyamurthy, a nineteen-year-old who lives with his uncle Murugan, is unable to retain any job due to his honest nature. He becomes acquainted with Gopal, with whose recommendation he becomes Raju's personal house servant. When Sathyamurthy displays his mother's photograph at his house to pray for her, it is revealed that Sathyamurthy is the son of Raju and Parvathi. Parvathi had survived the accident, was cared for by Murugan and died a few years after giving birth to Sathyamurthy without divulging the identity of Raju to Sathyamurthy and Murugan. Sathyamurthy improves his reading and writing skills with the help of Sundaram's daughter, Gowri and the two fall in love. When Raju learns of their love, he approves of their marriage. Gopal comes to know that Sathyamurthy is Raju's son, but dies of a sudden heart attack before revealing it.\n\nJealous of Sathya Murthy's influence on Raju, Rathnam and his wife hide Vimala's diamond necklace in Sathyamurthy's suitcase in an effort to get rid of him. Vimala, upset at losing her necklace, searches the house for it. When Raju, Sundaram, Gowri, and Sathyamurthy return after attending a conference in Kodaikanal, Vimala, acting on Rathnam's provocation, orders that Sathyamurthy's suitcase is searched. When the necklace is found in it, Raju throws Sathyamurthy out of his house, despite Sathyamurthy proclaiming his innocence. Gowri then shows Parvathi's photograph to Raju, who is shocked to learn that Sathyamurthy is his own son. Raju reveals the truth about Parvathi to Vimala, who also accepts Sathyamurthy as her son. Before Raju and Vimala rush to bring Sathyamurthy back, Raju learns of a fire breaking out in one of his mills. Sathyamurthy, unhappy of being wrongly accused by Raju, attempts suicide by entering the burning mill. Raju saves Sathyamurthy in time and reveals the truth about his birth to him. The family is united and Sathyamurthy marries Gowri.\n\n== Cast ==\nAdapted from the opening credits:<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=Uyarndha Manithan |type=motion picture |language=ta |publisher=[[AVM Productions]] |year=1968 |time=0:00 to 2:08 |time-caption=Opening credits, from}}</ref>\n* [[Sivaji Ganesan]] as Rajalingam \"Raju\"\n* [[Sowcar Janaki]] as Vimala\n* [[S.

The instrumentation of the band was originally sixteen pieces, consisting of trumpets, trombones, French horns, and a rhythm section but no saxophones. He introduced a saxophone section in 1970 and expanded the trumpet section to include a fifth trumpet in 1976, bringing the total to twenty-two members.\n\nIn 1977 McConnell recorded a double LP called 'Big Band Jazz'.  This was a 'direct cut' LP using [[Direct-to-disc recording]].  A small number of albums which recorded direct-to-disc began to appear on the market in the late 1970s and were marketed as \"audiophile\" editions, promising superior sound quality compared with recordings made using the more common multi-track tape recording methods.  On McConnell's direct cut double LP, an entire side (15 minutes and 2 seconds) was devoted to a version of Gershwin's [[Porgy and Bess]].  The double album won the [[Juno Award for Best Jazz Album]] in 1978.\n\nIn 1988, McConnell took a teaching position at the [[Dick Grove]] School of Music in California but gave up his position and returned to Canada a year later.

Macy]] and, in flashbacks, [[imdbname:1881849|Jacob DeMonte-Finn]]) aged 52, is the father of six children. He is a deadbeat alcoholic and drug addict who relies on his children to get by. He also swindles the state welfare system and taught this type of opportunistic deceit to his children. Since Frank refuses to work and most of the children are underage, the family lives far below the federal [[poverty threshold]] for a family of their size. As mentioned by one of his sons, Lip, Frank is intelligent and finished high school before he attended college to study psychology, where he met Monica. They dated for about 2 weeks before he dropped out of school and they got married.\n\nFrank has [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] with almost any available woman to support himself. For instance, he begins a relationship with Sheila Jackson when he discovers that she gets maximum disability benefits for her [[agoraphobia]]. He is the biological father of Sammi, Fiona, Lip, Debbie, Carl, and Liam, but not to Ian, who is presumed to be the son of Frank's brother Clayton, making him Frank's nephew as well as the children's half-brother and cousin. Despite that, he refers to Ian as his son. Frank is also the grandfather of Chuckie, Frances, Carl's unnamed twins, and Freddie.\n\nThe children do not think highly of him and refer to him primarily by his first name, though there have been occasions where they have called him \"Dad\". Although Frank preaches self-righteously about political and social issues, he spends most of his time developing schemes to [[Welfare fraud|cheat the system]] and takes advantage of others to make money. He pays little attention to his children but displays care and concern for them in drastic circumstances, having shown on occasion that he does indeed love his children, and at times proves himself to be a better parent than Monica or his own mother.\n\nIn season 1, he is introduced as an alcoholic deadbeat who neglects his children after his wife abandons the family. The older Gallagher children resent him while the younger ones still have faith in him. Frank attempts to cash a settlement check only to find that he needs it to be signed by his estranged wife Monica and tracks her down. She agrees to sign the check on the condition that he give up their youngest child Liam so that she and her new girlfriend can raise him. Frank learns through two paternity tests that he is indeed Liam's father but not Ian, who is the result of an affair. The pair make amends after the event and Frank walks away. \n  \nIn season 2, his mother Peggy is released from prison and the root of Frank's bad parenting is revealed to stem from his own childhood with his abusive parents. The main factor was his mother, who was often neglectful and condescending of him and left him scarred. Frank finds himself at her beck and call, as she puts him down at any opportunity. A saddened Frank finds comfort in Fiona, who now sees what her father went through as a child and finds him better than Peggy. After Peggy moves in to Frank's house, Frank's former trauma returns, such as his bedwetting and being his mother's personal servant. He briefly contemplates [[matricide|killing his mother]] in her sleep, but continues to assist her as her health deteriorates. After Sheila suffocates Peggy to death, he rejoices at being free of his mother's influence.\n\nDuring Season 3, he calls CPS on Fiona out of spite and is kicked out of the house once his actions are revealed. At court, he retains his parental rights while Fiona is named guardian of the children. During his exile from the Gallagher house, he finds Carl and they bond while stealing from the latter's former foster parents. When the police try to arrest Carl, Frank selflessly takes full responsibility for the theft and is arrested while Carl, Lip, and Ian look on. Frank is released when his [[Cirrhosis|liver fails]] as a result of his [[chronic alcoholism|chronic alcoholism]]. Frank is initially in denial of this fact and bonds with Lip to congratulate him on his high school graduation. However, he succumbs to his illness and is sent to the hospital. Fiona reveals that she loves him and only wishes for him to show his love to the family, since she fears that he does not care for them.\n\nIn Season 4, he returns home and is tended to by Carl. After Fiona refuses to help him by donating her liver, he reveals the existence of his eldest daughter Sammi, much to Fiona's shock. Frank and Carl track down Sammi, where he finds her with a child of her own. Although she is initially not aware of their connection, Frank accidentally reveals the truth after he learns she is not a match for a liver transplant, which causes her to kick him out. Later on, Sammi tracks him down and they reconcile. Due to him having parental rights, Frank is needed to reclaim a hospitalized Liam. Afterwards, Sammi, Carl, and Sheila go out of their way to arrange Frank's liver surgery. Frank bonds with Sammi and sees that she is more like the other Gallagher kids than he thought. They find an unlicensed Bangladeshi surgeon willing to do the operation, using a Bangladeshi donor. The surgeon initially asks for $30,000 but when the two women admit they can only pay $26,000, he reluctantly agrees to operate. The cost of the surgery is covered by selling Sheila's furniture and Sheila's savings. The surgeon makes off with the money and one of Frank's kidneys, leaving Frank with his original failing liver. Nevertheless, Frank is supplied with a healthy liver when his condition deteriorates and pushes him to the top of the donor list. Afterwards, he shares a beer with Carl to thank him for his help and rejoices at surviving the ordeal.\n \nIn season 5, a home beer brewing mishap causes Sheila to leave for good. He moves back into the house, asserting himself as their father and refusing to leave. He allows Sammi to move in after her trailer is confiscated; However, she shoots Frank in the arm when he refuses to leave the house and does not show care for her. Frank gets payback by implicating his grandson Chuckie for Carl's heroin smuggling attempt. In episode 9, Frank embarks on a \"[[Kick the bucket|bucket list]]\" style spree with a doctor named Bianca, who has advanced pancreatic cancer. They spend Bianca's last days together and although some of Bianca's thrill-seeking tendencies are too much for Frank, they end up in Costa Rica. After leaving a note for Frank, Bianca commits suicide by walking naked into the ocean. Frank returns home distraught and tells Lip and Ian that Bianca has died.\n\nIn season 6, he supports Debbie's pregnancy and reconnects with his ex-girlfriend Queenie (Sammi's mother). After he ruins Fiona's wedding the Gallagher kids (except Lip, Liam, and Fiona) and friends have had enough of him and throw him off a bridge into a frozen river.\n\nIn Season 7, he is shown to have survived the fall, and falls into a coma for a month in a hospital. He awakens with brief amnesia. He returns to the Alibi and everyone is surprised that he survived. Frank recalls them throwing him off the bridge and is angry at the pain they put him through, as well as the fact that no one looked for him during the month he was comatose. Kevin is the only person who feels guilty. Frank attempts to go back to his house, where he is depressed to learn from Carl that no one looked for him because they hoped he was dead. Fiona kicks Frank out of the house and the other children do the same. Hurt by this, he \"disowns\" them (except Liam) and attempts to start over with a \"new\" family he finds at a homeless shelter. Frank and his new family crash a realtor's showing of a house on his block. When the realtor calls the cops, he manipulates them into thinking the old owner okayed it. Frank establishes the home as a homeless shelter and attracts the attention and money of a wealthy philanthropist. Frank basks in his fortune and accumulates even more by manipulating the patrons of his shelter into earning money. He is eventually thrown out a window when the homeless patrons find out he's been hoarding the money they've earned. He suffers an injured arm and leg before he tries to burn the house in revenge. Instead, he helps Liam get into a private school. Near the end of the season, he is allowed to return to his old home after he starts making amends with the family, including helping fix up the house with some stolen possessions from the shelter. Frank is reunited with Monica and falls back into their old habits, only to be devastated when she dies from brain damage. He is later attacked by Monica's enraged father and shares touching words at her funeral before leaving heartbroken. Afterwards, he is allowed to return home with all animosity ended and he is once again accepted by his children.\n\nIn season 8, Frank copes with Monica's death by consuming [[Crystal meth|meth]] she gave him, before having a [[midlife crisis]] where he decides to restart his life as a 21 year old, having realized that Monica was the trigger of his alcoholism and bad parenting. As a result, he becomes sober and starts going by Francis to disassociate from his past. He cleans up his hygiene up, gets a real job, makes amends with his family and friends, buys a car, and tries to be a more productive member of society. While his children believe Frank has lost it, he proves his change is genuine by protecting his family from an armed meth head who was Monica's partner, earning him Fiona's gratitude. Frank soon bonds with his youngest son Liam and acts more fatherly to him, as he sees Liam as his last chance to be a proper parent. However, when the hardware store chain he is working at shuts down and he is unable to find new employment, Frank starts to fall back into his old ways.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/shameless-season-8-spoilers-emmy-rossum-jeremy-allen-white-william-h-macy-1202547937/|title=\u2018Shameless\u2019 Season 8: Trump\u2019s America, Sobriety and a New Frank?|last=Turchiano|first=Danielle|date=2017-09-07|work=Variety|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDuring Season 9, he reverts back to his old self and sleeps with many of the mothers in the PTA and secretly stealing from them to pawn their belongings. After an STD outbreak sweeps through the PTA, Frank is revealed to be the source. Because of this, his son Liam is expelled from private school and forced to attend public school. Frank also nominates former congressman Mo White during a congressional election as a part of a scam to earn money, though he ends up with second thoughts after the man is revealed to be a sex offender.  Despite that, he continues on as campaign manager and attempts to win the election by any means necessary, going as far as recruiting Terry Milkovich to intimidate voters. Mo wins the race, but Frank is fired as campaign manager. He later ends up the hospital for his liver and meets a bipolar woman named Ingrid who catches his interest. He starts a relationship with her and they go on to have a series of adventures. Ingrid asks Frank to fertilize her eggs but since his habits have left him sterile, he bribes Carl into donating sperm, and Ingrid finds herself pregnant with six fetuses. As he is financially insecure, he enters a local contest to win money. Ingrid realizes Frank cannot be depended upon and returns to her ex-husband, who pays Frank to stay away. Frank mostly falls back into his old habits again and bonds with Fiona after she spirals into alcoholism. Frank injures his leg and is rendered out of commission for months, which forces his children to hire a nurse for him. When Fiona leaves for good, he wishes his daughter luck while thanking her for what she has done.\n\nIn Season 10, Frank recovers from his injuries and resumes his old habits. He reunites with his old friend Mikey and they carry out a series of scams. He  becomes a grandfather to Lip's son Freddy. When Mikey is sent to prison, Frank continues his scams. Very soon, Frank is visited by his ex-girlfriend's husband who tried to pawn off her twins. Frank later reveals that the babies are actually Carl's, much to the latter's shock.\n\n===Fiona Gallagher===\n'''Fiona Monica Gallagher''' ([[Emmy Rossum]]), aged 29, is the eldest of the Gallagher children. As a result of her mother's absence and Frank's neglect, most of the responsibility for child-rearing falls on her shoulders, which forces her out of high school in her junior year. Fiona works a few dead-end minimum-wage jobs to support her five siblings. Though often stressed and exhausted, she always carries out her responsibilities. Prone to selflessness, she sometimes needs to be reminded to look out for her own happiness.\n\nIn Season 1, Fiona begins a relationship with Steve Wilton and juggles her own desire for happiness with her responsibilities towards her siblings. At the end of the season, she is distraught to learn of Steve's illicit activities and, despite an invitation to run away with him to Brazil, stays in Chicago with her family.\n\nIn Season 2, she shows that she loves her father in spite of his neglect after she witnesses her previously imprisoned grandmother's abusive treatment of him. Fiona comforts him and sees his bad parenting stems from her. Steve returns, but Fiona is shocked to find he is married to a Brazilian woman named Estefania and that his real name Jimmy Lishman, who is the son of wealthy parents. Although these revelations strain their relationship, they eventually reconcile. At the end of season 2, Fiona receives her [[GED]] and begins to take more interest in jobs.\n\nDuring season 3, after Frank calls social services out of spite, Fiona wins a court case and is appointed her siblings' legal guardian, though Frank maintains parental rights, which strains her relationship with Jimmy. Towards the end of season 3, Fiona gets a better job with a cup manufacturing company, although Jimmy leaves.\n\nIn season 4, she moves up in her job and puts in effort to financially support her family. However, she refuses to help her ailing father with his liver. She is shocked to learn of his oldest daughter, who he never told her of.

After the breakup, Liam ingests cocaine that Fiona got from Robbie at her birthday party and is hospitalized. Fiona is arrested for child neglect and drug possession. Mike posts her bail and she is put under house arrest with a curfew. When Fiona breaks her probation by partying with Robbie, she is incarcerated with a 90-day sentence. She is released shortly after due to overcrowding in the prison and gets a job at a diner.\n\nIn season 5, Fiona impulsively marries Gus Pfender, the bassist of an indie rock band. She then cheats on Gus with Jimmy when he appears in town once again. Her extramarital affair with Jimmy, along with her budding relationship with her manager, Sean, end her marriage. She begins dating Sean afterwards. She discovers she is pregnant around the same time as Debbie does, though she is unsure as to who father is. She gets an abortion and urges Debbie to do the same. By the end of season 6, Fiona and Sean plan to get married, but Frank ruins their happiness on their wedding day by revealing that Sean has continued using heroin behind Fiona's back, causing Sean to leave.\n\nAt the start of season 7, Fiona becomes acting manager at Patsy's Pies in Sean's absence and refuses to deal with the fallout of her aborted wedding. She begins to act more selfishly as she is tired of being unappreciated by her family members. She bans Frank from the house, despite appreciating him for saving her from marrying Sean. She learns her boss, Margo, is also a high-school dropout but has amassed a net worth of $300 million, and Fiona wants to follow in her footsteps. She sees an opportunity to invest in a deteriorating laundromat and uses the Gallagher home as collateral, which angers Lip. She eventually sells the laundromat to Margo and buys an apartment building.\n\nWhen Monica dies, Fiona is indifferent and declares her willingness to have the funeral consist of a bonfire in the funeral home parking lot using the ashes stored in a bag. Fiona buries her portion of the inheritance meth in Monica's casket. She lets Frank return home after reconciling with him.\n\nIn season 8, she becomes the owner of an apartment building. She begins to be more independent while still assisting her family. Toward the end of the season, she begins seeing a dashing Irish man named Ford.\n\nIn Season 9, Fiona tries to help Ian with his situation while others tell her to let him settle it himself. Fiona realizes that she cannot always help and is pleased when Ian handles it. She continues to handle her business and starts investing while continuing her relationship with Ford. However, she learns Ford is married and goes bankrupt following a bad investment. She is forced to sell her building and falls into a drunk slump. Fiona finds solace when Debbie gives her a chance to humiliate Ford as revenge for his deceit. As a result of her downward spiral, her role as caretaker falls into Debbie's hands. Her drunken antics results in her being fired from the pie shop and being arrested for assaulting a neighbor. Eventually, Lip kicks her out when she accidentally gets his Alcoholics Anonymous sponsee drunk. Fiona's habits warrant Frank's attention who also tells her to check herself. After waking up after a night of drinking in her former apartment building, she attends an AA meeting and gets a job at the advice of her attorney. While working at a gas station, she learns from an old business partner that an investment she made garnered her a large sum of money. The man offers to buy her out, giving her $100,000. Quitting her job, she meets with her attorney, who advises her to leave her past behind. She realizes her siblings have grown up and no longer need her; advice from Ian cements her decision to leave Chicago. Fiona's family try to throw a party to see her off, but she resolves to leave beforehand, afraid that she will have second thoughts and stay. She amicably parts with her father, who thanks her for all she has done. Before leaving, she leaves her family a check for $50,000 and leaves Chicago on an airplane.\n\n=== Lip Gallagher ===\n\n'''Phillip \"Lip\" Ronan Gallagher''' ([[Jeremy Allen White]]) aged 24, is the second Gallagher child and the most academically minded. In high school he was a straight-A student. He created various money-making schemes to help the Gallagher clan survive, such as running an ice cream truck that also sold beer and marijuana and fraudulently taking the SAT's for fellow classmates for a fee; this latter scheme is thwarted by Professor Hearst, an investigator from the Educational Evaluation Service. After testing Lip in private, Hearst discovers Lip is one of the statistically very rare students capable of achieving a perfect SAT score and offers him an internship at the robotics lab at the University of Chicago, which Lip turns down. Hearst gets Lip in trouble with his past clients by invalidating all of their SAT scores, since they didn't actually take the tests themselves. In addition to being adept scientifically, Lip, like his father, is multilingual; in season 2 he speaks Portuguese and Italian and in season 4 he speaks Spanish.\n\nOutside the classroom, Lip spends much of his time drinking beer, smoking weed, and eventually participating in car theft schemes with Jimmy. Lip has a strong bond with Ian and is the first one to discover that Ian is gay. During the first season of the show, while tutoring Karen Jackson in mathematics, Lip develops a sexual relationship with her, and soon falls in love with her despite her refusal to commit. In season 2, Karen reveals to be pregnant with what is believed to be Lip's baby. Despite some initial hesitance, Lip looks forward to being a father and is devastated when the child is not his.\n\nLip starts a new relationship with Mandy Milkovich. They live together from season 2 until season 3; Lip briefly lived at her house and she eventually moved herself in with the Gallaghers. Though Mandy and Lip have an insatiable sexual relationship, he is annoyed when the relationship becomes more domestic and Mandy becomes \"clingy\". When Mandy discovers Lip does not plan to going to college, she believes that he is wasting his potential and his chances for a brighter future. When she secretly applies to colleges on his behalf, he is accepted by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], among others. Lip breaks off their relationship when he learns that Mandy hit Karen with her car, an accident that resulted in serious injuries and brain damage, to keep Karen from him. Despite some setbacks, Lip graduates from high school, which the family celebrates.\n\nIn season 4, Lip begins courses at Chicago Polytechnic. He struggles to balance his studies, his job at the cafeteria, and his family life. Lip's new girlfriend Amanda helps him and his grades improve. He takes over as caregiver for the house when Liam ingests Fiona's cocaine and she is arrested. \n\nIn season 5, Lip works for Tommy in construction. At Amanda's summer home, Lip and Amanda's father initially do not get along. However, Amanda's father offers Lip an internship when they find some common ground. Lip starts to turn his life around but is challenged when Mickey and his brothers plan to raid a caf\u00e9. After the raid, Mickey locks Lip out of the getaway car, leaving him to hide from the police. Despite difficulties in paying for his education, Lip receives a grant and also begins an affair with a professor named Helene Runyon. Helene invites Lip into her home and her husband catches them, but condones the affair due to an apparent taste for voyeurism. Because of his affair with the much more worldly Helene, Lip starts losing interest in Amanda, and she eventually punches him in the face when he reveals he did not take their relationship as seriously as she was.\n\nIn season 6, Amanda gets her revenge by posting a naked picture of Helene online. This causes Helene to get fired and her relationship with Lip to end.

Macy]] and, in flashbacks, [[imdbname:1881849|Jacob DeMonte-Finn]]) aged 52, is the father of six children. He is a deadbeat alcoholic and drug addict who relies on his children to get by. He also swindles the state welfare system and taught this type of opportunistic deceit to his children. Since Frank refuses to work and most of the children are underage, the family lives far below the federal [[poverty threshold]] for a family of their size. As mentioned by one of his sons, Lip, Frank is intelligent and finished high school before he attended college to study psychology, where he met Monica. They dated for about 2 weeks before he dropped out of school and they got married.\n\nFrank has [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] with almost any available woman to support himself. For instance, he begins a relationship with Sheila Jackson when he discovers that she gets maximum disability benefits for her [[agoraphobia]]. He is the biological father of Sammi, Fiona, Lip, Debbie, Carl, and Liam, but not to Ian, who is presumed to be the son of Frank's brother Clayton, making him Frank's nephew as well as the children's half-brother and cousin. Despite that, he refers to Ian as his son. Frank is also the grandfather of Chuckie, Frances, Carl's unnamed twins, and Freddie.\n\nThe children do not think highly of him and refer to him primarily by his first name, though there have been occasions where they have called him \"Dad\". Although Frank preaches self-righteously about political and social issues, he spends most of his time developing schemes to [[Welfare fraud|cheat the system]] and takes advantage of others to make money. He pays little attention to his children but displays care and concern for them in drastic circumstances, having shown on occasion that he does indeed love his children, and at times proves himself to be a better parent than Monica or his own mother.\n\nIn season 1, he is introduced as an alcoholic deadbeat who neglects his children after his wife abandons the family. The older Gallagher children resent him while the younger ones still have faith in him. Frank attempts to cash a settlement check only to find that he needs it to be signed by his estranged wife Monica and tracks her down. She agrees to sign the check on the condition that he give up their youngest child Liam so that she and her new girlfriend can raise him. Frank learns through two paternity tests that he is indeed Liam's father but not Ian, who is the result of an affair. The pair make amends after the event and Frank walks away. \n  \nIn season 2, his mother Peggy is released from prison and the root of Frank's bad parenting is revealed to stem from his own childhood with his abusive parents. The main factor was his mother, who was often neglectful and condescending of him and left him scarred. Frank finds himself at her beck and call, as she puts him down at any opportunity. A saddened Frank finds comfort in Fiona, who now sees what her father went through as a child and finds him better than Peggy. After Peggy moves in to Frank's house, Frank's former trauma returns, such as his bedwetting and being his mother's personal servant. He briefly contemplates [[matricide|killing his mother]] in her sleep, but continues to assist her as her health deteriorates. After Sheila suffocates Peggy to death, he rejoices at being free of his mother's influence.\n\nDuring Season 3, he calls CPS on Fiona out of spite and is kicked out of the house once his actions are revealed. At court, he retains his parental rights while Fiona is named guardian of the children. During his exile from the Gallagher house, he finds Carl and they bond while stealing from the latter's former foster parents. When the police try to arrest Carl, Frank selflessly takes full responsibility for the theft and is arrested while Carl, Lip, and Ian look on. Frank is released when his [[Cirrhosis|liver fails]] as a result of his [[chronic alcoholism|chronic alcoholism]]. Frank is initially in denial of this fact and bonds with Lip to congratulate him on his high school graduation. However, he succumbs to his illness and is sent to the hospital. Fiona reveals that she loves him and only wishes for him to show his love to the family, since she fears that he does not care for them.\n\nIn Season 4, he returns home and is tended to by Carl. After Fiona refuses to help him by donating her liver, he reveals the existence of his eldest daughter Sammi, much to Fiona's shock. Frank and Carl track down Sammi, where he finds her with a child of her own. Although she is initially not aware of their connection, Frank accidentally reveals the truth after he learns she is not a match for a liver transplant, which causes her to kick him out. Later on, Sammi tracks him down and they reconcile. Due to him having parental rights, Frank is needed to reclaim a hospitalized Liam. Afterwards, Sammi, Carl, and Sheila go out of their way to arrange Frank's liver surgery. Frank bonds with Sammi and sees that she is more like the other Gallagher kids than he thought. They find an unlicensed Bangladeshi surgeon willing to do the operation, using a Bangladeshi donor. The surgeon initially asks for $30,000 but when the two women admit they can only pay $26,000, he reluctantly agrees to operate. The cost of the surgery is covered by selling Sheila's furniture and Sheila's savings. The surgeon makes off with the money and one of Frank's kidneys, leaving Frank with his original failing liver. Nevertheless, Frank is supplied with a healthy liver when his condition deteriorates and pushes him to the top of the donor list. Afterwards, he shares a beer with Carl to thank him for his help and rejoices at surviving the ordeal.\n \nIn season 5, a home beer brewing mishap causes Sheila to leave for good. He moves back into the house, asserting himself as their father and refusing to leave. He allows Sammi to move in after her trailer is confiscated; However, she shoots Frank in the arm when he refuses to leave the house and does not show care for her. Frank gets payback by implicating his grandson Chuckie for Carl's heroin smuggling attempt. In episode 9, Frank embarks on a \"[[Kick the bucket|bucket list]]\" style spree with a doctor named Bianca, who has advanced pancreatic cancer. They spend Bianca's last days together and although some of Bianca's thrill-seeking tendencies are too much for Frank, they end up in Costa Rica. After leaving a note for Frank, Bianca commits suicide by walking naked into the ocean. Frank returns home distraught and tells Lip and Ian that Bianca has died.\n\nIn season 6, he supports Debbie's pregnancy and reconnects with his ex-girlfriend Queenie (Sammi's mother). After he ruins Fiona's wedding the Gallagher kids (except Lip, Liam, and Fiona) and friends have had enough of him and throw him off a bridge into a frozen river.\n\nIn Season 7, he is shown to have survived the fall, and falls into a coma for a month in a hospital. He awakens with brief amnesia. He returns to the Alibi and everyone is surprised that he survived. Frank recalls them throwing him off the bridge and is angry at the pain they put him through, as well as the fact that no one looked for him during the month he was comatose. Kevin is the only person who feels guilty. Frank attempts to go back to his house, where he is depressed to learn from Carl that no one looked for him because they hoped he was dead. Fiona kicks Frank out of the house and the other children do the same. Hurt by this, he \"disowns\" them (except Liam) and attempts to start over with a \"new\" family he finds at a homeless shelter. Frank and his new family crash a realtor's showing of a house on his block. When the realtor calls the cops, he manipulates them into thinking the old owner okayed it. Frank establishes the home as a homeless shelter and attracts the attention and money of a wealthy philanthropist. Frank basks in his fortune and accumulates even more by manipulating the patrons of his shelter into earning money. He is eventually thrown out a window when the homeless patrons find out he's been hoarding the money they've earned. He suffers an injured arm and leg before he tries to burn the house in revenge. Instead, he helps Liam get into a private school. Near the end of the season, he is allowed to return to his old home after he starts making amends with the family, including helping fix up the house with some stolen possessions from the shelter. Frank is reunited with Monica and falls back into their old habits, only to be devastated when she dies from brain damage. He is later attacked by Monica's enraged father and shares touching words at her funeral before leaving heartbroken. Afterwards, he is allowed to return home with all animosity ended and he is once again accepted by his children.\n\nIn season 8, Frank copes with Monica's death by consuming [[Crystal meth|meth]] she gave him, before having a [[midlife crisis]] where he decides to restart his life as a 21 year old, having realized that Monica was the trigger of his alcoholism and bad parenting. As a result, he becomes sober and starts going by Francis to disassociate from his past. He cleans up his hygiene up, gets a real job, makes amends with his family and friends, buys a car, and tries to be a more productive member of society. While his children believe Frank has lost it, he proves his change is genuine by protecting his family from an armed meth head who was Monica's partner, earning him Fiona's gratitude. Frank soon bonds with his youngest son Liam and acts more fatherly to him, as he sees Liam as his last chance to be a proper parent. However, when the hardware store chain he is working at shuts down and he is unable to find new employment, Frank starts to fall back into his old ways.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/shameless-season-8-spoilers-emmy-rossum-jeremy-allen-white-william-h-macy-1202547937/|title=\u2018Shameless\u2019 Season 8: Trump\u2019s America, Sobriety and a New Frank?|last=Turchiano|first=Danielle|date=2017-09-07|work=Variety|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDuring Season 9, he reverts back to his old self and sleeps with many of the mothers in the PTA and secretly stealing from them to pawn their belongings. After an STD outbreak sweeps through the PTA, Frank is revealed to be the source. Because of this, his son Liam is expelled from private school and forced to attend public school. Frank also nominates former congressman Mo White during a congressional election as a part of a scam to earn money, though he ends up with second thoughts after the man is revealed to be a sex offender.  Despite that, he continues on as campaign manager and attempts to win the election by any means necessary, going as far as recruiting Terry Milkovich to intimidate voters. Mo wins the race, but Frank is fired as campaign manager. He later ends up the hospital for his liver and meets a bipolar woman named Ingrid who catches his interest. He starts a relationship with her and they go on to have a series of adventures. Ingrid asks Frank to fertilize her eggs but since his habits have left him sterile, he bribes Carl into donating sperm, and Ingrid finds herself pregnant with six fetuses. As he is financially insecure, he enters a local contest to win money. Ingrid realizes Frank cannot be depended upon and returns to her ex-husband, who pays Frank to stay away. Frank mostly falls back into his old habits again and bonds with Fiona after she spirals into alcoholism. Frank injures his leg and is rendered out of commission for months, which forces his children to hire a nurse for him. When Fiona leaves for good, he wishes his daughter luck while thanking her for what she has done.\n\nIn Season 10, Frank recovers from his injuries and resumes his old habits. He reunites with his old friend Mikey and they carry out a series of scams. He  becomes a grandfather to Lip's son Freddy. When Mikey is sent to prison, Frank continues his scams. Very soon, Frank is visited by his ex-girlfriend's husband who tried to pawn off her twins. Frank later reveals that the babies are actually Carl's, much to the latter's shock.\n\n===Fiona Gallagher===\n'''Fiona Monica Gallagher''' ([[Emmy Rossum]]), aged 29, is the eldest of the Gallagher children. As a result of her mother's absence and Frank's neglect, most of the responsibility for child-rearing falls on her shoulders, which forces her out of high school in her junior year. Fiona works a few dead-end minimum-wage jobs to support her five siblings. Though often stressed and exhausted, she always carries out her responsibilities. Prone to selflessness, she sometimes needs to be reminded to look out for her own happiness.\n\nIn Season 1, Fiona begins a relationship with Steve Wilton and juggles her own desire for happiness with her responsibilities towards her siblings. At the end of the season, she is distraught to learn of Steve's illicit activities and, despite an invitation to run away with him to Brazil, stays in Chicago with her family.\n\nIn Season 2, she shows that she loves her father in spite of his neglect after she witnesses her previously imprisoned grandmother's abusive treatment of him.
