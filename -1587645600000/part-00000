{"title_page": "Dungeon Hills", "text_new": "[[File:Dungeon Hills.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\nThe '''Dungeon Hills''' are a range of hills in the [[Galloway Hills]] range, part of the [[Southern Uplands]] of [[Scotland]]. The central of three parallel ridges, they are neighboured by the [[Range of the Awful Hand]] to the west and the [[Rhinns of Kells]] to the east. The range is also perpendicular to the [[Minnigaff Hills]] range, immediately south. In total, these four ranges are part of the [[Galloway Forest Park]]. \n\n===The Hills===\n------------------------------------\nThe hills of the range are the lowest and craggiest of the Galloway Hills with the highest, Mullwharchar, reaching 692m. They are split between [[East Ayrshire]] and [[Dumfries and Galloway]] along the Mullwharchar-Dungeon Hill col, following the Pulskaig Burn. Often regarded as the roughest hills in the Southern Uplands, walks can frequently take longer than anticipated due to the underfoot conditions of tussocks and bog. The range is the most remote of the Galloway Hills as the nearest road link to the north is approximately 2 miles away at Craigmalloch on the banks of Loch Doon, requiring an approach along an unclassified road. <ref>https://www.historicenvironment.scot/visit-a-place/places/loch-doon-castle/getting-here/</ref> As a result, many hillwalkers begin their walk at the Glentrool Visitor Centre to the southwest and follow the path past [[Loch Trool]] to then ascend opposite the Gairland Burn and eventually to [[Loch Valley]] and [[Loch Neldricken]].

Mohanlal also sang a song (\"Vazhiyoram\") with [[Chithra]] for the film. The story is about the love between a violinist played by Mohanlal and a terminally ill girl played by Urvashi. The music and background score were composed by Raveendran.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the first scene, we are shown an old man named Venu (Mohanlal) who came with flowers to strew his lady's grave. The story is narrated through his memories. Venu was an educated young man who worked for a wealthy businessman Menon (Thilakan) at his tea plantation. After being fired, he tried to get his job back by playing music for Menon's only daughter, Sarojam (Urvashi)\n\nSarojam eventually fell in love with Venu and expresses her wish to marry him.  Wanting to keep her unawares about her fatal condition, [[aplastic anaemia]], Menon was ready to do anything for her. Menon tells Venu about the illness and asks him whether he was ready for the marriage. Menon offers him all the wealth and the complete authority of his family business. Venu, whose family is in a dire state, accepts the offer and marries Sarojam. Initially, he pretended to love her as he felt sympathetic for her and wanted to make her happy always. However, gradually he falls in true love with her and an inseparable relation blossoms between them. Sarojam gives birth to a daughter, Ammu.\n\nWhen Ammu is a few years old, Sarojam develops severe symptoms of the disease. Dr. Menon (Soman) suggests that [[bone marrow transplant may lead to a recovery in her. After the bone marrow transplant, Sarojam seem to recover but soon her condition worsens and she dies in the hands of Venu. Then we are shown the first scene, which was Venu standing aside Sarojam's grave. After a while, Unni, a close friend of Venu comes there to inform him that his daughter Ammu is also affected with the same disease. Venu is shocked but he was not allowed to cry even as Ammu should never know about this. The heartbroken Venu returns to his bungalow with Ammu. There he has a strange visitor named Hari ([[Vineeth]]), an unemployed young man, who comes there with a recommendation letter for a job. Soon, Venu realizes that, what has happened in his and Sarojam's life is getting repeated in his daughter's life too, through Hari.

It is among the poshest and popular districts of Delhi. The Locality falls under Category 'A' of residential colonies in Delhi alongside other Category 'A' colonies like [[Greater Kailash]], [[Defence_Colony|Defence Colony]], and [[Gulmohar Park]]. The neighbourhood registered a 4.4% growth in residential sales and was recently featured alongside [[Greater Kailash]] , Defence Colony, [[Vasant Vihar]] and Anand Niketan in the 2019 edition of [[Knight Frank]] 's quarterly report on prime luxury residential properties in various megacities around the globe. \n\nThe locality is divided into two parts i.e. Main and Extension.\n\n==Real Estate==\nEstablished in the early 1960's, Green Park today is among the most desired neighborhoods in the capital city. The Locality not only has its very own metro station on the yellow line but also has numerous professionally maintained parks in each block. It has its own prime market which hosts numerous chic salons, boutiques and eating joints. It also borders the famous Deer Park which is known to be among the very few large green spaces left in today's heavily urbanized Delhi. The real estate market however has been witnessing a downturn due to the increased circle rates of the colony. This has discouraged fresh purchases of builder floors and independent villas in the colony which now cost anywhere between INR 6-50 crores (US $800,000 - $7,000,000). The plot sizes are plenty and range from 200 sq. yards to 1500 sq.yards. Rental values have however witnessed a constant increase due to the direct metro connectivity and plenty of other facilities which other colonies of New Delhi lack. To address the parking problems in the colony due to the heavy footfall, two multilevel parking towers are being built near the metro station which will accommodate 60-70 cars at a given time. \n\n==History==\nIt was established in the early 1960's and today has all the amenities of a rich cosmopolitan culture along with large residential and commercial areas and many religious places. Green Park is considered by some as the \"lungs\" of Delhi, as it is near one of the largest green areas in the city. It is also believed to be an upscale residential area with real estate prices soaring as high as \u20b9100 crore (US $14.5 million). It is part of the [[New Delhi (Lok Sabha constituency)]], and its current electorate member is [[Meenakshi Lekhi]] of [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]]\n\nIt is divided into two parts : Green Park Main and Green Park Extension. The Main hosts a medium-sized market with several restaurants and a shopping complex. The Extension mostly consists of residential areas.\nIt has a number of open and wooded spaces in its vicinity - Deer Park, District Park and Rose Garden. These are very popular areas with morning walkers and laughter clubs.\n\nThe [[Uphaar Cinema fire]], one of the worst fire tragedies in recent Indian history, occurred on Friday, 13 June 1997 at Uphaar Cinema, near Green Park Extension Block A, Delhi, during the premiere screening of [[Border (1997 film)|Border]], a Hindi movie. 59 people died and 103 were seriously injured in the subsequent stampede; most of the victims were trapped on the balcony and were asphyxiated as they tried to reach dimly marked exits to escape the smoke and fire, and found the doors locked.\n\nThe fire broke out at 5:10 pm, after the transformer at the parking level burst, and 20 cars in the parking lot caught fire, eventually leading to a large scale fire in the five-storey building which housed the cinema hall and several offices. The cinema hall was situated in one of the busiest areas of South Delhi and the fire services were delayed owing to the heavy evening traffic. At least 48 fire tenders were pressed into service at 5.20 p.m. and it took them over an hour to put out the fire. Later the dead and the injured were rushed to the nearby All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Safdarjung Hospital, where scenes of chaos and pandemonium followed, as relatives and family members of the victims scurried around to look for known faces.\n\nThe victims of the tragedy and the families of the deceased later formed 'The Association of Victims of Uphaar Fire Tragedy' (AVUT), which filed the landmark Civil compensation case and won Rs 25 crore (Rs 250 million) in civil compensation for the relatives and families of victims, the judgment is now considered a breakthrough in Compensation Law in India; today they meet at every anniversary at 'Smriti Upavan' memorial, outside the hall, where a prayer meeting is held. However the Supreme Court on 13/10/2011 nearly halved the sum of compensation awarded to them by the Delhi high court and slashed punitive damages to be paid by cinema owners Ansal brothers from Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 25 lakh.\nContents\n\n==Geography==\nIt is bounded on the 4 sides by major avenues: Inner Ring Road, Outer Ring Road, Aurobindo Marg and Africa Avenue.

Administratively, Mekelle is considered a Special Zone, which is divided into seven sub-cities. Mekelle is the economic, cultural, and political hub of northern Ethiopia.\n\nMekelle has grown rapidly since 1991. In 1984 it had 61,583 inhabitants, in 1994, 96,938 (96.5% being Tigrinya-speakers), and in 2006 169,200 (i.e. 4% of the population of Tigray). Mekelle is 2.6 times larger than [[Adigrat]], the second largest regional center. It is the fifth largest city in Ethiopia, after [[Addis Ababa]], [[Dire Dawa]], [[Adama]], and [[Gondar]]. The largest proportion of the population of Mekelle depends on government employment, commerce and small-scale enterprises. Mekelle now has new engineering, cement and textile factories, producing for the local and foreign market. There is a rising university which developed out of the pre-1991 Arid Agricultural College, and about a dozen other governmental and private colleges.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==History==\n\n=== Origins ===\nMekelle is believed to have evolved from a 13th-century hamlet called Enda Meseqel (later Enda Medhane Alem), becoming a town by the early 19th century, when ''ras'' Wolde Selassie of [[Enderta Province|Enderta]] made [[Antalo]] his seat of power, and the region of Mekelle ({{Convert|40|km|mi}} to the north) his recreational center).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Salt, Trade and Urbanization: the Story of M\u00e4q\u00e4l\u00e4 Town, 1872-1935|last=Taddesse|first=Madhane|publisher=Addis Ababa University|year=1995|isbn=|location=Addis Ababa|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=\u12e8\u1218\u1240\u120c \u12a8\u1218\u1230\u122b\u1228\u1275\u1293 \u12a5\u12f5\u1308\u1275|last=Sakkwar|first=Taddese|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=Mekelle|pages=|trans-title=Foundation and Growth of M\u00e4q\u00e4l\u00e4 Town}}</ref> In the tax records of ''atse'' [[Tewodros II]], Mekelle appears as a tributary district within Enderta with a ''negarit'' of its own.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tax Records of and Inventories of Emperor Tewodros of Ethiopia, 1855-1868|last=Asfaw|first=Girmaselassie|last2=Pankhurst|first2=Richard|publisher=University of London|year=1979|isbn=0728600579|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== 19th century ===\n[[File:Mekele_1896.jpg|thumb|''Atse'' [[Yohannes IV]]'s grand castle in 1896.]]\nThe credit for Mekelle's growth into a regional capital goes to ''atse'' [[Yohannes IV]] who made Mekelle political capital of his expanding state. He must have chose the place for its strategic proximity both to rich agricultural areas (of [[Raya Azebo]]) and to the [[Afar Region|Afar]] salt country. Mekelle's position on the route to [[Shewa]], the power base of Yohannes's main rival [[Menelik II|Menelik]] could have been another factor. Three institutions still important for modern Mekelle were founded by Yohannes:\n* The grand palace built in 1882-84 by his architect [[Giacomo Naretti]], together with the engineer Engedashet Schimper and still forms the nucleus of Mekelle.\n* The large market Edaga Senuy (\"Monday Market\")\n* The church, at Debre Gennet Medhane Alem, built after the return from Raya Azebo campaign in 1871.\nIn the 1880s, Mekelle became the Emperor's capital city. Among the factor that further accelerated Mekele's growth and urbanization were the establishment of residential quarters by the \"nobility\" and court servants, the prominence of the ''amole'' salt market and the subsequent establishment of local and foreign trading and occupational communities, and Mekelle'a strategic position as a transit center for commodities of the long-distance trade routes of north eastern Ethiopia, attached to the Red Sea ports, and to northern and central Ethiopia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gebrelibanos|first=Tsegay|date=2009|title=The Ethiopian Salt Trading System in the 20th Century: A View from M\u00e4q\u00e4la, Northern Ethiopia|url=|journal=Proceedings of the 16th International Conference of Ethiopian Studies|volume=|pages=185\u2013201|via=}}</ref> By establishing a market in Mekelle, Yohannes could draw on the norther trade routes as well as the salt caravan routes to the town, capitalizing on his political leverage.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe succession of ''atse'' [[Menelik II]] of Shewa signaled a trading reorientation from northern to southern Ethiopia (centered in Shewa). The new capital Addis Ababa quickly outstripped Mekelle, which, however, retained its political importance as the district and regional administration center of Enderta and [[Tigray Province|Tigray]] respectively through the 20th century, and its economical role in the Ethiopian salt trade.\n[[File:Enda_Yesus_(Church_of_Jesus)_Fort,_Mek'ele,_Ethiopia,_ca._1890.JPG|thumb|The fort of Enda Eyesus.|left]]\nDuring the Italian War of 1895\u201396, Mekelle became an important site in the conflict. After the fall of [[Adwa]] in spring 1895, ''ras'' [[Ras Mengesha Yohannes|Mengasha Yohannes]] retreated from his father's capital Mekelle following the advice of ''atse'' Menelik II. Mekelle was occupied by the Italians without a shot and integrated into the ''Colonia Eritrea''; from here the Italians extended their occupation south, up to Ambalage.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gl'Italiani in Africa: l'assedio di Macall\u00e8|last=Montegazza|first=Vico|publisher=Successori Le Monnier|year=1896|isbn=|location=Firenze|pages=}}</ref> The Italian army established their fort near the Enda Eyesus church above Mekelle in October 1895. After the re-occupation of Ambalage in late 1895, the fort was besieged by Ethiopian troops, who cut the Italians' water supply. When the Italians surrendered in January 1896, Menelik allowed them to retreat to their stronghold [[Adigrat]], probably hoping to prevent an escalation of the conflict, and he appointed his own governor over Enderta at Mekelle, ''dejazmach'' Tedla Abaguben, in order to check the rebellious Tigrayan princes.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThree historical epochs sustained Mekelle's urbanization in the 20th century. The first was the advent of ''dejazmach'' Abreha Araya Demsu, governor of Eastern Tigray with Mekelle as his capital. Abreha imitated his cousin Yohannes by establishing his own splendid palace (now the Hotel called Abreha Castle) on a hill facing the grand palace, a new Saturday Market (Edaga Senbet), and a new church, Selassie, all of which were situated to the south of Mekelle proper. Likewise, he attracted various occupational groups including Muslim traders, women service vendors, and army retainers. Consequently, in the 1920s and early 1930s, Mekelle witnessed a remarkable growth in trade. ''Dejazmach'' [[Haile Selassie Gugsa]] renovated the Palace in the center to use it as his seat.\n\nThe second phase occurred during the Italian occupation (1936\u201341). The Italians, who occupied the town in November 1935, contributed considerable to the modernization of Mekelle. They built a military airport and a fort at Enda Eyesus (now the main compound of [[Mekelle University]]); reorganized roads, telephone lines, offices and residences; and installed modern water pipelines, electricity, clinics, postal services, cinema hall and resort/sport centers. They also expanded Edaga Senbet by introducing corrugated iron shops. This also attracted foreign entrepreneurs (Greeks, Arabs and Armenians). Mekelle, then divided into two zones; Italian and Native, grew about twice its former size. In 1938, there were shops, two Italian-style restaurants and Hotel Amba Aradam with 4 rooms. There was a post, telephone and telegraph office, and a hospital. An important market was held on Mondays.<ref name=\"guida\">{{cite book |last1=Consociazione turistica Italiana |title=Guida dell'Africa orientale Italiana |location=Milano |page=302|url=http://www.petitesondes.net/Guida-AOI.htm}}</ref> Starting from May 1943, Mekelle was in the hands of the leaders of the [[Woyane rebellion|Woyane uprising]] against the then weak restored Haile Selassie government. the following British air bombardment of the town of September\u2013October heavily damaged the; on October 1943 Mekelle was recaptured by the Ethiopian government forces.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dying Lion: Feudalism and Modernization in Ethiopia|last=Gilkes|first=Patrick|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1975|isbn=|location=London|pages=180, 188}}</ref>\n\nThe third phase in Mekelle's urban development took place mainly during 1942\u201374. Modern urban sectors were diversified, and new administrative offices were established. The Mekelle municipality (founded 1942), telecommunications and post office, Commercial Bank and the ''atse'' Yohannes Elementary (in 1952) and Secondary School (in 1960) were established. The master plan was issued in 1962. Small-scale enterprises such as oil refineries, soap mills, leather and caning bags, costumes and flour mills were established until 1974. Most of the industrial establishments, however, have declined, degraded or closed during the 1974-91 wars.\n\nDuring the [[1983\u201385 famine in Ethiopia]], Mekelle was notorious for the seven \"hunger camps\" around the city. These housed 75,000 refugees with 20,000 more waiting to enter. During March 1985, 50 to 60 people died in these seven camps every day. In February 1986, the TPLF released 1,800 political prisoners from the Mekelle prison in a daring military action. The operation was named ''Agazi,'' after one of the founding fighters of the TPLF, who had been killed in the second year of the [[Ethiopian Civil War]].\n\nA holy cross for the celebration of the Meskel holiday on the mountains on the east side of Mekelle.\n\nIn a series of offensives launched on 25 February 1988, TPLF fighters bypassed Mekelle but took control of [[Maychew]], [[Korem]] and other places along the Dessie-Mekelle road. By June 1988, TPLF controlled all of Tigray except the city of Mekelle and the territory a radius of {{Convert|15|km|mi}} around the city. In response, the Derg had a number of villages around Mekelle burned on June 4 and 5, which included Addi Gera, Bahri, Goba Zena, Grarot, Issala, and Rabea. It was not until 25 February 1989 that Mekelle was also occupied by the TPLF, after the government position in Tigray had collapsed.\n\nOn 5 June 1998 the [[Eritrea]]n Air Force bombed Ayder School in Mekelle during the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] killing twelve. A monument pays respects to this tragedy.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nOn 29 December 2002, a riot broke out between [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] and [[Adventism|Adventist]] worshippers, over an Adventist prayer service being conducted in a stadium. Some Ethiopian Orthodox believers, upset by the display of public Adventist preaching, reportedly sparked the clashes by first throwing stones at Adventists gathered in the stadium, then by looting Adventist offices in the city. [[Law enforcement in Ethiopia|Police]] intervened to break up the riots, which resulted in five dead and three seriously injured. The police reported that 10 people were detained, but independent sources reported that the number was much larger.\n\nThe [[United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea]] (UNMEE) headquarters was established in Mekelle in 2000 following the end of the [[Eritrean\u2013Ethiopian War]] and continued until 30 July 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unmee.unmissions.org/|title=UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea is withdrawn|last=|first=|date=30 July 2008|website=UNMEE|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Cityscape ==\n[[File:ET Mekele asv2018-01 img15 Martyrs Memorial.jpg|thumb|The [[Tigrayan People's Liberation Front|martyrs]]' memorial and museum.]]\nThe martyrs' memorial monument pays respects to the over 60,000 TPLF fighters who died and over 100,000 fighters who were injured in the overthrow of the marxist [[Derg]] regime in 1991.

Within each local administration there are ''kebeles'' or ''ketenas''.  The subcities of Mekelle comprise the area formerly incorporated as Mekelle City.  While falling under the jurisdiction of Mekele Special Zone Government, each subcity is also a borough with its own administrator, like other cities of Ethiopia. These officials oversee socio-economic development and run health, education, and utilities.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Popular Participation in Decentralized Governance|last=Habtu|first=Adonay|publisher=Mekelle University|year=2011|isbn=|location=Mekelle|pages=29}}</ref>\n\nThe subcities differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the regional government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Mekelle Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city. The \"three central subcities\" of Mekelle \u2013 Kedamay Weyane, Ayder and Hawelti \u2013 are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population. Semien is unique occupied by many major factories.

Mekelle is the economic, cultural, and political hub of northern Ethiopia.\n\nMekelle has grown rapidly since 1991. In 1984 it had 61,583 inhabitants, in 1994, 96,938 (96.5% being Tigrinya-speakers), and in 2006 169,200 (i.e. 4% of the population of Tigray). Mekelle is 2.6 times larger than [[Adigrat]], the second largest regional center. It is the fifth largest city in Ethiopia, after [[Addis Ababa]], [[Dire Dawa]], [[Adama]], and [[Gondar]]. The largest proportion of the population of Mekelle depends on government employment, commerce and small-scale enterprises. Mekelle now has new engineering, cement and textile factories, producing for the local and foreign market. There is a rising university which developed out of the pre-1991 Arid Agricultural College, and about a dozen other governmental and private colleges.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==History==\n\n=== Origins ===\nMekelle is believed to have evolved from a 13th-century hamlet called Enda Meseqel (later Enda Medhane Alem), becoming a town by the early 19th century, when ''ras'' Wolde Selassie of [[Enderta Province|Enderta]] made [[Antalo]] his seat of power, and the region of Mekelle ({{Convert|40|km|mi}} to the north) his recreational center).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Salt, Trade and Urbanization: the Story of M\u00e4q\u00e4l\u00e4 Town, 1872-1935|last=Taddesse|first=Madhane|publisher=Addis Ababa University|year=1995|isbn=|location=Addis Ababa|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=\u12e8\u1218\u1240\u120c \u12a8\u1218\u1230\u122b\u1228\u1275\u1293 \u12a5\u12f5\u1308\u1275|last=Sakkwar|first=Taddese|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=Mekelle|pages=|trans-title=Foundation and Growth of M\u00e4q\u00e4l\u00e4 Town}}</ref> In the tax records of ''atse'' [[Tewodros II]], Mekelle appears as a tributary district within Enderta with a ''negarit'' of its own.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tax Records of and Inventories of Emperor Tewodros of Ethiopia, 1855-1868|last=Asfaw|first=Girmaselassie|last2=Pankhurst|first2=Richard|publisher=University of London|year=1979|isbn=0728600579|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== 19th century ===\n[[File:Mekele_1896.jpg|thumb|''Atse'' [[Yohannes IV]]'s grand castle.]]\nThe credit for Mekelle's growth into a regional capital goes to ''atse'' [[Yohannes IV]] who made Mekelle political capital of his expanding state. He must have chose the place for its strategic proximity both to rich agricultural areas (of [[Raya Azebo]]) and to the [[Afar Region|Afar]] salt country. Mekelle's position on the route to [[Shewa]], the power base of Yohannes's main rival [[Menelik II|Menelik]] could have been another factor. Three institutions still important for modern Mekelle were founded by Yohannes:\n* The grand palace built in 1882-84 by his architect [[Giacomo Naretti]], together with the engineer Engedashet Schimper and still forms the nucleus of Mekelle.\n* The large market Edaga Senuy (\"Monday Market\")\n* The church, at Debre Gennet Medhane Alem, built after the return from Raya Azebo campaign in 1871.\nIn the 1880s, Mekelle became the Emperor's capital city. Among the factor that further accelerated Mekele's growth and urbanization were the establishment of residential quarters by the \"nobility\" and court servants, the prominence of the ''amole'' salt market and the subsequent establishment of local and foreign trading and occupational communities, and Mekelle'a strategic position as a transit center for commodities of the long-distance trade routes of north eastern Ethiopia, attached to the Red Sea ports, and to northern and central Ethiopia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gebrelibanos|first=Tsegay|date=2009|title=The Ethiopian Salt Trading System in the 20th Century: A View from M\u00e4q\u00e4la, Northern Ethiopia|url=|journal=Proceedings of the 16th International Conference of Ethiopian Studies|volume=|pages=185\u2013201|via=}}</ref> By establishing a market in Mekelle, Yohannes could draw on the norther trade routes as well as the salt caravan routes to the town, capitalizing on his political leverage.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe succession of ''atse'' [[Menelik II]] of Shewa signaled a trading reorientation from northern to southern Ethiopia (centered in Shewa). The new capital Addis Ababa quickly outstripped Mekelle, which, however, retained its political importance as the district and regional administration center of Enderta and [[Tigray Province|Tigray]] respectively through the 20th century, and its economical role in the Ethiopian salt trade.\n[[File:Enda_Yesus_(Church_of_Jesus)_Fort,_Mek'ele,_Ethiopia,_ca._1890.JPG|thumb|The fort of Enda Eyesus.|left]]\nDuring the Italian War of 1895\u201396, Mekelle became an important site in the conflict. After the fall of [[Adwa]] in spring 1895, ''ras'' [[Ras Mengesha Yohannes|Mengasha Yohannes]] retreated from his father's capital Mekelle following the advice of ''atse'' Menelik II. Mekelle was occupied by the Italians without a shot and integrated into the ''Colonia Eritrea''; from here the Italians extended their occupation south, up to Ambalage.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gl'Italiani in Africa: l'assedio di Macall\u00e8|last=Montegazza|first=Vico|publisher=Successori Le Monnier|year=1896|isbn=|location=Firenze|pages=}}</ref> The Italian army established their fort near the Enda Eyesus church above Mekelle in October 1895. After the re-occupation of Ambalage in late 1895, the fort was besieged by Ethiopian troops, who cut the Italians' water supply. When the Italians surrendered in January 1896, Menelik allowed them to retreat to their stronghold [[Adigrat]], probably hoping to prevent an escalation of the conflict, and he appointed his own governor over Enderta at Mekelle, ''dejazmach'' Tedla Abaguben, in order to check the rebellious Tigrayan princes.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThree historical epochs sustained Mekelle's urbanization in the 20th century. The first was the advent of ''dejazmach'' Abreha Araya Demsu, governor of Eastern Tigray with Mekelle as his capital. Abreha imitated his cousin Yohannes by establishing his own splendid palace (now the Hotel called Abreha Castle) on a hill facing the grand palace, a new Saturday Market (Edaga Senbet), and a new church, Selassie, all of which were situated to the south of Mekelle proper. Likewise, he attracted various occupational groups including Muslim traders, women service vendors, and army retainers. Consequently, in the 1920s and early 1930s, Mekelle witnessed a remarkable growth in trade. ''Dejazmach'' [[Haile Selassie Gugsa]] renovated the Palace in the center to use it as his seat.\n\nThe second phase occurred during the Italian occupation (1936\u201341). The Italians, who occupied the town in November 1935, contributed considerable to the modernization of Mekelle. They built a military airport and a fort at Enda Eyesus (now the main compound of [[Mekelle University]]); reorganized roads, telephone lines, offices and residences; and installed modern water pipelines, electricity, clinics, postal services, cinema hall and resort/sport centers. They also expanded Edaga Senbet by introducing corrugated iron shops. This also attracted foreign entrepreneurs (Greeks, Arabs and Armenians). Mekelle, then divided into two zones; Italian and Native, grew about twice its former size. In 1938, there were shops, two Italian-style restaurants and Hotel Amba Aradam with 4 rooms. There was a post, telephone and telegraph office, and a hospital. An important market was held on Mondays.<ref name=\"guida\">{{cite book |last1=Consociazione turistica Italiana |title=Guida dell'Africa orientale Italiana |location=Milano |page=302|url=http://www.petitesondes.net/Guida-AOI.htm}}</ref> Starting from May 1943, Mekelle was in the hands of the leaders of the [[Woyane rebellion|Woyane uprising]] against the then weak restored Haile Selassie government. the following British air bombardment of the town of September\u2013October heavily damaged the; on October 1943 Mekelle was recaptured by the Ethiopian government forces.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dying Lion: Feudalism and Modernization in Ethiopia|last=Gilkes|first=Patrick|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1975|isbn=|location=London|pages=180, 188}}</ref>\n\nThe third phase in Mekelle's urban development took place mainly during 1942\u201374. Modern urban sectors were diversified, and new administrative offices were established. The Mekelle municipality (founded 1942), telecommunications and post office, Commercial Bank and the ''atse'' Yohannes Elementary (in 1952) and Secondary School (in 1960) were established. The master plan was issued in 1962. Small-scale enterprises such as oil refineries, soap mills, leather and caning bags, costumes and flour mills were established until 1974. Most of the industrial establishments, however, have declined, degraded or closed during the 1974-91 wars.\n\nDuring the [[1983\u201385 famine in Ethiopia]], Mekelle was notorious for the seven \"hunger camps\" around the city. These housed 75,000 refugees with 20,000 more waiting to enter. During March 1985, 50 to 60 people died in these seven camps every day. In February 1986, the TPLF released 1,800 political prisoners from the Mekelle prison in a daring military action.

By June 1988, TPLF controlled all of Tigray except the city of Mekelle and the territory a radius of {{Convert|15|km|mi}} around the city. In response, the Derg had a number of villages around Mekelle burned on June 4 and 5, which included Addi Gera, Bahri, Goba Zena, Grarot, Issala, and Rabea. It was not until 25 February 1989 that Mekelle was also occupied by the TPLF, after the government position in Tigray had collapsed.\n\nOn 5 June 1998 the [[Eritrea]]n Air Force bombed Ayder School in Mekelle during the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] killing twelve.

Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Mekelle Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city. The \"three central subcities\" of Mekelle \u2013 Kedamay Weyane, Ayder and Hawelti \u2013 are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population.

The series stars [[Tiger Shroff]] as Ronnie. Each film starts with a fresh story unrelated to the preceding film's story.\n\n==Overview==\n===''Baaghi'' (2016)===\n{{Main|Baaghi (2016 film)}}\nThe film starts with [[martial arts]] champion Raghav Shetty ([[Sudheer Babu]]) kidnapping Sia Khurana ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) from her film's set in [[Hyderabad]] and taking her to [[Bangkok]]. Sia's father P.P. Khurana ([[Sunil Grover]]) goes to government offices and the police for help but no one is ready to assist them since Raghav is an influential man. Khurana then turns to Sia's ex-boyfriend, Ranveer \u2018Ronnie\u2019 Pratap Singh ([[Tiger Shroff]]).\n\nIn a flashback, Ronnie and Sia meet on a train. Raghav sees Sia at the train station and starts to like her. He tells his men to get information about her. Ronnie visits the martial arts school of a certain Guruswamy in [[Kerala]]. In a letter to Guruswamy, Ronnie's father explains that Ronnie is a ''Baaghi'' (rebel), and asks him to make Ronnie a good human being. Ronnie and Sia fall in love, and Sia gives him a ring she got from her father, asking him to always keep it. Raghav asks for Sia's hand from Khurana, and Khurana is so lost by greed when he sees how much money Raghav offers for Sia. He agrees to hand Sia over to Raghav but when he sees that Ronnie has Sia's ring, he realizes she is in love with Ronnie. He informs Raghav, who decides to kill Ronnie.\n\nRonnie beats up Raghav's men when they manhandle Subbu, a mute little boy Ronnie is close to, only for Raghav to get him arrested later on. Guruswamy tries to persuade Raghav, his son, to stop pursuing Sia, but Raghav poisons and kills him to get him out of the way. Ronnie is heartbroken to hear of Guruswamy's death since he had seen him as a father figure. Khurana then creates a misunderstanding between Sia and Ronnie to separate them, which works and the two-part ways.\n\nIn the present, Ronnie reaches [[Bangkok]] and visits Raghav's fight club, beating the strongest fighter there to get Raghav's attention. The next day, Ronnie breaks into the house of Raghav's right-hand man, Biju, and threatens Biju's wife at gunpoint, forcing him to reveal Sia's location. Finding out she was at the hospital, Ronnie saves Sia and escapes with her under both of them being disguised as a doctor and nurse. The two stop at an island on their way back to [[India]], where Sia discovers her father's deceit when she sees that Ronnie is still wearing her ring. The couple reconciles but Raghav and his men attack them. Biju shoots Ronnie, who falls off a cliff.\n\nRaghav takes Sia back to his place. It is then revealed that Ronnie is alive. It turns out that Biju had used blank bullets in his gun, sparing him as Ronnie had spared his wife's life earlier. Raghav kills Biju when Biju says that he believes Ronnie to be right.\n\nRonnie storms Raghav's building and single-handedly fights off all of the killers and swordsmen in Raghav's employ. He reaches Raghav, who initially overpowers him, but when Raghav reveals that he was the one who murdered Guruswamy, Ronnie becomes enraged and uses Guruswamy's signature moves to kill Raghav. In the end, Ronnie, now happily together with Sia, becomes the new teacher in Guruswamy's school, where a statue of Guruswamy now stands.\n\n===''Baaghi 2'' (2018)===\n{{Main|Baaghi 2}}\nThe film opens with a woman named Neha Rawat who has a sudden attack. On regaining consciousness, she looks for her missing daughter Rhea Salgaonkar. A helpless Neha calls Ronnie Pratap Singh, her former college boyfriend, who is now an [[Indian Army]] [[Para SF]] soldier. The film then shows the time of their introduction to each other.\n\nFour years ago, Ronnie and Neha met in college. Though initially, Neha does not like him, they become friends and he falls in love with her. After proposing to Neha, Ronnie promises to her that he will always help and be with her if she is ever in trouble. On their wedding day, Neha's father, Mahendra, suffers a heart attack and then Neha goes to meet him at a hospital. Mahendra, who doesn't like Ronnie, asks Neha not to marry him as he fixed her marriage with his friend's son Shekhar Salgaonkar. On her father's last wish, Neha leaves Ronnie.\n\nBack in the present, at the hotel Ronnie is asked to meet Neha, he finds her frightened, broken and lost. On asking her about her family, Neha reveals that her 3-year-old daughter, Rhea, has been missing since she dropped her at school on Rhea's first school day, where she was assaulted outside the gates and Rhea was taken by kidnappers.\n\nWhen Ronnie asks Neha about Shekhar, she tells him that Shekhar has been depressed since the kidnap. Neha requests Ronnie to help her find Rhea. Ronnie remembers his promise and accepts the task to find Rhea.\n\nRonnie goes to rent a car, where he meets and befriends a lump man named Usman Langda. Ronnie and Neha visit the police station where FIR writer Inspector Sharad Kutey acts inappropriately towards Neha. Ronnie beats him up, an action that gets him arrested, but he is subsequently released after Kutey's boss, [[Deputy Inspector General of Police|DIG]] Ajay Shergill, requests for it.\n\nAfter his release, Ronnie questions Neha in her apartment but as suddenly Neha's alcoholic and drug-abusing brother-in-law Sunny, arrives, she tells him to leave. When Sunny goes out, Ronnie asks Neha for his address. He begins to look for clues but everybody he asks claims that Shekhar and Neha had no daughter.\n\nUnable to find Rhea through any CCTV footage, Ronnie meets a police inspector who has photos of Rhea including certificates to prove that Neha is telling the truth. Ronnie then meets Shekhar who tells him that Neha had a miscarriage following an accident. She was diagnosed with PTSD and began thinking that she and Shekhar had a daughter who doesn't exist.\n\nOn hearing Shekhar's tellings, Ronnie asks Neha but she denies it, claiming everyone is against her and insisting she has a daughter. When Ronnie claims she doesn't have a daughter, she asks him to leave which is when he notices the marks of Rhea's height growth on the wall. He starts to doubt his beliefs but is too late as Neha commits [[suicide]], feeling clueless because no one believed her.\n\nThe police reach the spot immediately with [[Assistant commissioner|ACP]] Loha Singh Dhull. Loha suspects Shekhar. The police find Ronnie using Neha's contacts. After Usman confesses seeing Rhea with Sunny, Ronnie leaves the hotel and finds Sunny, but Sunny is taken into custody by the police. While being interrogated, he attacks Ajay but is shot in the subsequent fight and dies.\n\nFor his next attempt, Ronnie goes to Usman's office where Usman is attacked by the thugs that assaulted him. He beats up the thugs but Usman dies from his injuries. Ronnie takes the phone of one of the thugs, revealing texts about their targets, followed by a photo of himself which was taken in Ajay's home. He realizes that Ajay is the mastermind.\n\nAfter killing an entire army of goons all alone in a secluded forest in Ajay's place in [[Vietnam|Goa]], Ronnie confronts Ajay in his dungeon, who reveals being paid by Shekhar for planning Rhea's kidnapping, as Shekhar hated Rhea. Everyone involved with the family was either killed or bribed into playing along and Neha was being brain-washed so that she would appear insane, as the only person who knew about her daughter's existence.\n\nHaving heard this, Ronnie defeats Ajay in a fight. Loha arrives and shoots Ajay to death. Ronnie gets a glimpse of Rhea before fainting. After regaining consciousness, Loha tells that Rhea is Ronnie's illegitimate daughter. After learning this, Ronnie remembers that time when Neha met him to end their relationship and ended up consummating their relationship four years ago. He sees Neha's spirit telling him that Rhea is the most beautiful thing about their relationship.\n\nLoha tells Ronnie that Shekhar confessed and revealed that he kidnapped Rhea since his doctor declared him sterile, revealing that Rhea wasn't his child. The film ends with Ronnie beginning to live with Rhea and seeing a reflection of the dead Neha sitting behind them.\n\n===''Baaghi 3'' (2020)===\n{{Main|Baaghi 3}}\nUnemployed goon Ranveer \"Ronnie\" Pratap Singh ([[Tiger Shroff]]) lives with his elder brother Vikram ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]).

The series stars [[Tiger Shroff]] as Ronnie. Each film starts with a fresh story unrelated to the preceding film's story.\n\n==Overview==\n===''Baaghi'' (2016)===\n{{Main|Baaghi (2016 film)}}\nThe film starts with [[martial arts]] champion Raghav Shetty ([[Sudheer Babu]]) kidnapping Sia Khurana ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) from her film's set in [[Hyderabad]] and taking her to [[Bangkok]]. Sia's father P.P. Khurana ([[Sunil Grover]]) goes to government offices and the police for help but no one is ready to assist them since Raghav is an influential man. Khurana then turns to Sia's ex-boyfriend, Ranveer \u2018Ronnie\u2019 Pratap Singh ([[Tiger Shroff]]).\n\nIn a flashback, Ronnie and Sia meet on a train. Raghav sees Sia at the train station and starts to like her. He tells his men to get information about her. Ronnie visits the martial arts school of a certain Guruswamy in [[Kerala]]. In a letter to Guruswamy, Ronnie's father explains that Ronnie is a ''Baaghi'' (rebel), and asks him to make Ronnie a good human being. Ronnie and Sia fall in love, and Sia gives him a ring she got from her father, asking him to always keep it. Raghav asks for Sia's hand from Khurana, and Khurana is so lost by greed when he sees how much money Raghav offers for Sia. He agrees to hand Sia over to Raghav but when he sees that Ronnie has Sia's ring, he realizes she is in love with Ronnie. He informs Raghav, who decides to kill Ronnie.\n\nRonnie beats up Raghav's men when they manhandle Subbu, a mute little boy Ronnie is close to, only for Raghav to get him arrested later on. Guruswamy tries to persuade Raghav, his son, to stop pursuing Sia, but Raghav poisons and kills him to get him out of the way. Ronnie is heartbroken to hear of Guruswamy's death since he had seen him as a father figure. Khurana then creates a misunderstanding between Sia and Ronnie to separate them, which works and the two-part ways.\n\nIn the present, Ronnie reaches [[Bangkok]] and visits Raghav's fight club, beating the strongest fighter there to get Raghav's attention. The next day, Ronnie breaks into the house of Raghav's right-hand man, Biju, and threatens Biju's wife at gunpoint, forcing him to reveal Sia's location. Finding out she was at the hospital, Ronnie saves Sia and escapes with her under both of them being disguised as a doctor and nurse. The two stop at an island on their way back to [[India]], where Sia discovers her father's deceit when she sees that Ronnie is still wearing her ring. The couple reconciles but Raghav and his men attack them. Biju shoots Ronnie, who falls off a cliff.\n\nRaghav takes Sia back to his place. It is then revealed that Ronnie is alive. It turns out that Biju had used blank bullets in his gun, sparing him as Ronnie had spared his wife's life earlier. Raghav kills Biju when Biju says that he believes Ronnie to be right.\n\nRonnie storms Raghav's building and single-handedly fights off all of the killers and swordsmen in Raghav's employ. He reaches Raghav, who initially overpowers him, but when Raghav reveals that he was the one who murdered Guruswamy, Ronnie becomes enraged and uses Guruswamy's signature moves to kill Raghav. In the end, Ronnie, now happily together with Sia, becomes the new teacher in Guruswamy's school, where a statue of Guruswamy now stands.\n\n===''Baaghi 2'' (2018)===\n{{Main|Baaghi 2}}\nThe film opens with a woman named Neha Rawat who has a sudden attack. On regaining consciousness, she looks for her missing daughter Rhea Salgaonkar. A helpless Neha calls Ronnie Pratap Singh, her former college boyfriend, who is now an [[Indian Army]] [[Para SF]] soldier. The film then shows the time of their introduction to each other.\n\nFour years ago, Ronnie and Neha met in college. Though initially, Neha does not like him, they become friends and he falls in love with her. After proposing to Neha, Ronnie promises to her that he will always help and be with her if she is ever in trouble. On their wedding day, Neha's father, Mahendra, suffers a heart attack and then Neha goes to meet him at a hospital. Mahendra, who doesn't like Ronnie, asks Neha not to marry him as he fixed her marriage with his friend's son Shekhar Salgaonkar. On her father's last wish, Neha leaves Ronnie.\n\nBack in the present, at the hotel Ronnie is asked to meet Neha, he finds her frightened, broken and lost. On asking her about her family, Neha reveals that her 3-year-old daughter, Rhea, has been missing since she dropped her at school on Rhea's first school day, where she was assaulted outside the gates and Rhea was taken by kidnappers.\n\nWhen Ronnie asks Neha about Shekhar, she tells him that Shekhar has been depressed since the kidnap. Neha requests Ronnie to help her find Rhea. Ronnie remembers his promise and accepts the task to find Rhea.\n\nRonnie goes to rent a car, where he meets and befriends a lump man named Usman Langda. Ronnie and Neha visit the police station where FIR writer Inspector Sharad Kutey acts inappropriately towards Neha. Ronnie beats him up, an action that gets him arrested, but he is subsequently released after Kutey's boss, [[Deputy Inspector General of Police|DIG]] Ajay Shergill, requests for it.\n\nAfter his release, Ronnie questions Neha in her apartment but as suddenly Neha's alcoholic and drug-abusing brother-in-law Sunny, arrives, she tells him to leave. When Sunny goes out, Ronnie asks Neha for his address. He begins to look for clues but everybody he asks claims that Shekhar and Neha had no daughter.\n\nUnable to find Rhea through any CCTV footage, Ronnie meets a police inspector who has photos of Rhea including certificates to prove that Neha is telling the truth. Ronnie then meets Shekhar who tells him that Neha had a miscarriage following an accident. She was diagnosed with PTSD and began thinking that she and Shekhar had a daughter who doesn't exist.\n\nOn hearing Shekhar's tellings, Ronnie asks Neha but she denies it, claiming everyone is against her and insisting she has a daughter. When Ronnie claims she doesn't have a daughter, she asks him to leave which is when he notices the marks of Rhea's height growth on the wall. He starts to doubt his beliefs but is too late as Neha commits [[suicide]], feeling clueless because no one believed her.\n\nThe police reach the spot immediately with [[Assistant commissioner|ACP]] Loha Singh Dhull. Loha suspects Shekhar. The police find Ronnie using Neha's contacts. After Usman confesses seeing Rhea with Sunny, Ronnie leaves the hotel and finds Sunny, but Sunny is taken into custody by the police. While being interrogated, he attacks Ajay but is shot in the subsequent fight and dies.\n\nFor his next attempt, Ronnie goes to Usman's office where Usman is attacked by the thugs that assaulted him. He beats up the thugs but Usman dies from his injuries. Ronnie takes the phone of one of the thugs, revealing texts about their targets, followed by a photo of himself which was taken in Ajay's home. He realizes that Ajay is the mastermind.\n\nAfter killing an entire army of goons all alone in a secluded forest in Ajay's place in [[Vietnam|Goa]], Ronnie confronts Ajay in his dungeon, who reveals being paid by Shekhar for planning Rhea's kidnapping, as Shekhar hated Rhea. Everyone involved with the family was either killed or bribed into playing along and Neha was being brain-washed so that she would appear insane, as the only person who knew about her daughter's existence.\n\nHaving heard this, Ronnie defeats Ajay in a fight. Loha arrives and shoots Ajay to death. Ronnie gets a glimpse of Rhea before fainting. After regaining consciousness, Loha tells that Rhea is Ronnie's illegitimate daughter. After learning this, Ronnie remembers that time when Neha met him to end their relationship and ended up consummating their relationship four years ago. He sees Neha's spirit telling him that Rhea is the most beautiful thing about their relationship.\n\nLoha tells Ronnie that Shekhar confessed and revealed that he kidnapped Rhea since his doctor declared him sterile, revealing that Rhea wasn't his child. The film ends with Ronnie beginning to live with Rhea and seeing a reflection of the dead Neha sitting behind them.\n\n===''Baaghi 3'' (2020)===\n{{Main|Baaghi 3}}\nUnemployed goon Ranveer \"Ronnie\" Pratap Singh ([[Tiger Shroff]]) lives with his elder brother Vikram ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]). Ronnie rescues Vikram from any bad or dangerous situation. Vikram dislikes to involve himself in fights. Ronnie requests Vikram to take up a police job as their father Charan ([[Jackie Shroff]]) was in the police force years ago.\n\nRonnie secretly punishes goons as Vikram was timid and does not like violence. For this, Vikram rises to fame for his activities and is well received. Vikram had to fly to [[Syria]] for routine paperwork and bids goodbye to his brother. In a video chat, Ronnie witnesses Vikram beaten up by two people and as they kidnap him, Ronnie warns that he will destroy them and the country.\n\nRonnie arrives in Syria along with his girlfriend Siya ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]), who is also Vikram's wife Ruchi ([[Ankita Lokhande]])'s sister. They find out that Vikram was kidnapped by the [[ISIS]] whose leader is Abu Jalal Gaza. Ronnie fights his way through helicopters, tanks and lots of soldiers.
