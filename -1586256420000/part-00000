Wilhelm is a first-generation American; his father is a native of Krauschwitz, Germany, and was brought to the United States as a high school aged refugee of war-torn Germany by a Brethren Church farm family living near Auburn, Illinois (about 20 miles south of Springfield).<ref name=\"athensohiotoday.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.athensohiotoday.com/obituaries/constance-wilhelm/article_0a046654-d2df-5c71-bffe-2e88c50a81a9.html|title=Constance Wilhelm|first=Sara|last=Brumfield|publisher=}}</ref> \n \nWilhelm's pre-school years consisted of brief family stays in Champaign, Illinois, Lafayette, Louisiana, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, while his father completed a PhD in Geography at Louisiana State University.

At the age of 19, he was the first staffer hired by the then nascent Jimmy Carter presidential campaign in the State of Ohio. He was given the assignment of recruiting delegates and alternates in each of Ohio's congressional districts for the relatively unknown Georgia Governor.

During his time at the Kennedy School, he served as a teaching fellow for classes taught in public management by Professors Steven Kelman and Jonathan Brock.\n\n==Politics==\nBefore moving to the private sector, Wilhelm ran political campaigns for candidates such as Bill Clinton, [[Joe Biden]], and several Illinois-based Democrats, including [[Richard M.

As Chair, he re-established an advisory council of representatives from organized labor, and reached out to evangelical Christian voters, famously appearing before a convention of the [[Christian Coalition of America]] to a chorus of boos. Under Wilhelm's leadership, the DNC played a meaningful role in support of President Clinton's first budget proposal, which passed a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives by a single vote.

This was Millwall's 62nd season in the [[Football League]], and first ever season in the top tier of English football, after achieving promotion from the Second Division as Champions in [[1987\u201388 Football League|1987\u201388]].\n\n==Season summary==\nMillwall had won promotion to the First Division for the first time in their history as Second Division champions at the end of the 1987\u201388 season, and were among the pre-season favourites for relegation, but defied the odds and were top of the First Division by the beginning of October, having won four of their first six league games. By Christmas, they were still an impressive fifth in the league, but finished 10th at the end of the season after failing to win any of their final 10 games. Perhaps the only low point of the season was being defeated by arch-rivals [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] twice during the season, although Millwall still outperformed their local rivals for the first time in decades, as the Hammers were relegated in 19th place.\n\nMillwall finished one place above [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], one of the pre-season title favourites, and spent much of the season in a higher position than other teams who failed to emerge as title contenders after being among the pre-season favourites, including [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] \u2013 who both eventually finished slightly above Millwall.\n\nMillwall's high placing owed much to the strike partnership of [[Teddy Sheringham]] and [[Tony Cascarino]].\n\nIn his autobiography, Sheringham said of the season, ''\"It was a crazy exhilarating time. There we were, little Millwall, in our first season in the First Division and topping the table until about March. Everybody said it couldn't last and of course it couldn't and it didn't, but we gave them all a good run for their money.

League First Division]]. This was Millwall's 62nd season in the [[Football League]], and first ever season in the top tier of English football, after achieving promotion from the Second Division as Champions in [[1987\u201388 Football League|1987\u201388]].\n\n==Season summary==\nMillwall had won promotion to the First Division for the first time in their history as Second Division champions at the end of the 1987-88 season, and were among the pre-season favourites for relegation, but defied the odds and were top of the First Division by the beginning of October, having won four of their first six league games. By Christmas, they were still an impressive fifth in the league, but finished 10th at the end of the season after failing to win any of their final 10 games. Perhaps the only low point of the season was being defeated by arch-rivals [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] twice during the season, although Millwall still outperformed their local rivals for the first time in decades, as the Hammers were relegated in 19th place.\n\nMillwall finished one place above [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], one of the pre-season title favourites, and spent much of the season in a higher position than other teams who failed to emerge as title contenders after being among the pre-season favourites, including [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] - who both eventually finished slightly above Millwall.\n\nMillwall's high placing owed much to the strike partnership of [[Teddy Sheringham]] and [[Tony Cascarino]].\n\nIn his autobiography, Sheringham said of the season, ''\"It was a crazy exhilarating time. There we were, little Millwall, in our first season in the First Division and topping the table until about March. Everybody said it couldn't last and of course it couldn't and it didn't, but we gave them all a good run for their money. We were beating the best teams when we shouldn't and getting away draws to which we had no right.\"''\n\n==Squad==\n{{fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=|nat=ENG|pos=GK|name=[[Brian Horne]]}}\n{{Fs

Chapel Hill, 1998.</ref>\n\nThe largest source of slaves transported across the Atlantic Ocean for the New World was West Africa. Some West Africans were skilled iron workers and were therefore able to make tools that aided in their agricultural labor. While there were many unique tribes with their own customs and religions, by the 10th century many of the tribes had embraced Islam. Those villages in West Africa that were lucky enough to be in good conditions for growth and success, prospered.

This gave crewmen easy access to the women which was often regarded as one of the perks of the trade system.<ref name=\"white\" /> Not only did these rooms give the crewmen easy access to women but it gave enslaved women better access to information on the ship's crew, fortifications, and daily routine, but little opportunity to communicate this to the men confined in the ship's hold.<ref name=\"white\" /> As an example, women instigated a 1797 insurrection aboard the British ship ''Thomas'' by stealing weapons and passing them to the men below as well as engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the ship's crew.<ref name=\"white\" />\n\nIn the midst of these terrible conditions, African slaves plotted mutiny. Male slaves were the most likely candidates to mutiny and only at times they were on deck.<ref name=\"white\" /> While rebellions did not happen often, they were usually unsuccessful.

[[Massachusetts]] was the first colony to legalize slavery in 1641. Other colonies followed suit by passing laws that passed slavery on to the children of slaves and making non-Christian imported servants slaves for life.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAfricans first arrived in 1619, when a Dutch ship sold 19 blacks to Englishmen at [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] (today's [[Fort Monroe]]), thirty miles downstream from Jamestown, Virginia. In all, about 10\u201312 million Africans were transported to the Western Hemisphere. The vast majority of these people came from that stretch of the West African coast extending from present-day Senegal to Angola; a small percentage came from Madagascar and East Africa. Only 5% (about 500,000) went to the American colonies. The vast majority went to the West Indies and Brazil, where they died quickly. Demographic conditions were highly favorable in the American colonies, with less disease, more food, some medical care, and lighter work loads than prevailed in the sugar fields.<ref>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Kolchin |title=American Slavery, 1619\u20131877 |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |year=2003 |isbn=978-0809016303 }}</ref>\n\nAt first the Africans in the South were outnumbered by white indentured servants, who came voluntarily from Britain. They avoided the plantations. With the vast amount of good land and the shortage of laborers,  plantation owners turned to lifetime slaves who worked for their keep but were not paid wages and could not easily escape. Slaves had some legal rights (it was a crime to kill a slave, and a few whites were hanged for it.) Generally the slaves developed their own family system, religion and customs in the slave quarters with little interference from owners, who were only interested in work outputs. Before the 1660s, the North American mainland colonies were expanding, but still fairly small in size and did not have a great demand for labour, so the colonists did not import large numbers of African slaves at this point.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== Black population in 1700s ===\nBy 1700 there were 25,000 black slaves in the North American mainland colonies, about 10% of the population. Some had been shipped directly from Africa (most of them were from 1518 to the 1850s), but initially, very often they had been shipped via the West Indies in small cargoes after spending time working on the islands.<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\">John Murrin, Paul Johnson, James McPherson, Alice Fahs, Gary Gerstle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CRwJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT151  \"Expansion, Immigration, and Regional Differentiation\"], in ''Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People, Volume 1: To 1877'', Cengage Learning, 2011, p. 108.</ref> At the same time, many were native born on the North American mainland. Their legal status was now clear: they were slaves for life and so were the children of slave mothers. As white settlers began to claim and clear more land for large-scale farming and plantations, the number of slaves imported directly from Africa began to rapidly increase between the 1660s into the 1700s and onward, since the trade in slaves coming in from the West Indies was much too small to meet the huge demand for the now fast-growing North-American mainland slave market. Additionally, most American slave-buyers no longer wanted slaves coming in from the West Indies - by now they were either harder to obtain, too expensive, undesirable, or more often, ruined in many ways by the very brutal regime of the island sugar plantations. By the end of the seventeenth century, a relaxation of colonial tax laws, and the British Crown's removal of monopolies that had been granted to a very small number of British slave-traders like the Royal African Company, had made the direct slave trade with Africa much easier. As a result, freshly imported, young, and healthy Africans were now much more affordable, cheaper in price, and more readily available in large numbers to American slave buyers, who by now preferred to purchase them, even if it took some time for them to adjust to a new life as plantation slaves. From about 1700 to 1859, the majority of slaves imported to the North American mainland came directly from Africa in huge cargoes to fill the massive spike in demand for much-needed labour to work the continually expanding plantations in the Southern colonies (later to be states), with most heading to Virginia, South Carolina, and French or Spanish Louisiana.<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\"/> Unlike in the South, the Northern colonies developed into much more urbanized and industrialized societies, and they relied less on agriculture as the main economy, so, therefore, they did not import many African slaves, and the black population there remained fairly low for a very long time. However, big Northern cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Boston, had relatively large black populations (slave or free) for most of the colonial period and thereafter.\n\nFrom the 1750s, American-born slaves of African descent already began to outnumber African-born slaves. By the time of the American Revolution, a few of the Northern states had begun to consider abolishing slavery, and some Southern states like Virginia had produced such large and self-sustaining locally-born slave populations by natural increase, that they stopped taking in, direct imports of slaves from Africa altogether (but still kept slavery, which continued in the South). However, other Southern states like Georgia and South Carolina still relied on constant, fresh supplies of slave labour to keep up with the demand of their burgeoning plantation economies, so they continued to allow the direct importation of slaves from Africa right up to 1808, only stopping for a few years in the 1770s, because of a temporary lull in the trade brought on by the American Revolutionary War. The continued, direct importation of slaves from Africa ensured that for most of the eighteenth century, South Carolina's black population remained very high, with blacks outnumbering whites three to one, unlike in Virginia, which had a white majority, despite its large black slave population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/ethnography/aah/aaheritage/lowCountryA.htm|title=NPS Ethnography: African American Heritage & Ethnography|website=Nps.gov|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> It was said that South Carolina in the eighteenth century as a British colony looked much more like an extension of West Africa than it did of Britain. All legal, direct importation of slaves from Africa had stopped by 1808, when the now, newly formed United States finally banned its citizens from participating in the international slave trade altogether by law. Despite the ban, small to moderate cargoes of slaves were occasionally being illegally shipped into the United States directly from Africa for many years, as late as 1859.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slave-ships.blogspot.co.uk/2011/02/clotilde.html|title=Clotilde|website=Slave-ships.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate= August 28, 2017|date=February 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nSlowly a free black population emerged, concentrated in port cities along the Atlantic coast from Charleston to Boston.

The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], a document that would become a [[manifesto]] for human rights and personal freedom, was written by [[Thomas Jefferson]], who owned over 200 slaves. Other Southern statesmen were also major slaveholders. The [[Second Continental Congress]] did consider freeing slaves to disrupt British commerce. They removed language from the Declaration of Independence that included the promotion of slavery amongst the offenses of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. A number of free Blacks, most notably [[Prince Hall]]\u2014the founder of [[Prince Hall Freemasonry]], submitted [[petitions]] for the end of slavery.

[[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], the [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] of [[Virginia]], recruited 300 African-American men into his [[Ethiopian regiment]] within a month of making this proclamation. In South Carolina 25,000 slaves, more than one-quarter of the total, escaped to join and fight with the British, or fled for freedom in the uproar of war.  Thousands of slaves also escaped in Georgia and Virginia, as well as New England and New York.  Well-known [[Black Loyalist]] soldiers include [[Colonel Tye]] and [[Boston King]].\n\nThe Americans eventually won the war. In the provisional treaty, they demanded the return of property, including slaves.

Additionally, free blacks' rights were also restricted in many places. Most were denied the right to vote and were excluded from public schools. Some Blacks sought to fight these contradictions in court. In 1780, [[Elizabeth Freeman (Mum Bett)|Elizabeth Freeman]] and [[Quock Walker]] used language from the new [[Massachusetts]] constitution that declared all men were born free and equal in [[freedom suits]] to gain release from slavery.

Beginning in the 1750s, there was widespread sentiment during the American Revolution that slavery was a social evil (for the country as a whole and for the whites) that should eventually be abolished.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} All the Northern states passed emancipation acts between 1780 and 1804; most of these arranged for gradual emancipation and a special status for [[freedmen]], so there were still a dozen \"permanent apprentices\" into the 19th century.

By 1810, that number had risen to 186,446. Most of these were in the North, but Revolutionary sentiments also motivated Southern slaveholders.\n\nFor 20 years after the Revolution, more Southerners also freed slaves, sometimes by manumission or in wills to be accomplished after the slaveholder's death.  In the Upper South, the percentage of free blacks rose from about 1% before the Revolution to more than 10% by 1810. [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] worked to persuade slaveholders to free families. In Virginia the number of free blacks increased from 10,000 in 1790 to nearly 30,000 in 1810, but 95% of blacks were still enslaved.

Central to the growth of community among blacks was the [[Black church]], usually the first communal institution to be established. The Black church- was both an expression of community and unique African-American spirituality, and a reaction to discrimination. The churches also served as neighborhood centers where free black people could celebrate their African heritage without intrusion from white detractors.  The church also served as the center of education. Since the church was part of the community and wanted to provide education; it educated the freed and enslaved Blacks.

[[Pennsylvania]] was the first, in 1780 passing an act for gradual abolition.<ref>Edward Raymond Turner, \"The Abolition of Slavery in Pennsylvania.\" ''Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'' (1912): 129\u2013142. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20085586 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nA number of events continued to shape views on slavery. One of these events was the [[Haitian Revolution]], which was the only slave revolt that led to an independent country.

The industrial revolution in Europe and New England generated a heavy demand for cotton for cheap clothing, which caused an exponential demand for slave labor to develop new [[cotton plantation]]s. There was a 70% increase in the number of slaves in the United States in only 20 years. They were overwhelmingly concentrated on plantations in the [[Deep South]], and moved west as old cotton fields lost their productivity and new lands were purchased. Unlike the Northern States who put more focus into manufacturing and commerce, the South was heavily dependent on agriculture.<ref>Douglas R, Egerton, \"Slaves to the Marketplace: Economic Liberty and Black Rebelliousness in the Atlantic World.\" ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 26, no. 4 (Winter 2006): 617\u2013639.</ref> Southern political economists at this time supported the institution by concluding that nothing was inherently contradictory about owning slaves and that a future of slavery existed even if the South were to industrialize.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carlander|first=Jay|author2=Elliot Brownlee|title=Antebellum Southern Political Economists and the Problem of Slavery|journal=American Nineteenth Century History|date=September 2006|volume=7|issue=3|pages=393 |doi=10.1080/14664650600956585}}</ref>  Racial, economic, and political turmoil reached an all-time high regarding slavery up to the events of the Civil War.\n\nIn 1807, at the urging of President [[Thomas Jefferson]], Congress abolished the international slave trade. While American Blacks celebrated this as a victory in the fight against slavery, the ban increased the demand for slaves. Changing agricultural practices in the Upper South from tobacco to mixed farming decreased labor requirements, and slaves were sold to traders for the developing Deep South. In addition, the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]] allowed any Black person to be claimed as a runaway unless a White person testified on their behalf. A number of free Blacks, especially [[indentured servants|indentured]] children, were [[kidnap]]ped and sold into slavery with little or no hope of rescue. By 1819 there were exactly 11 free and 11 slave states, which increased [[sectionalism]]. Fears of an imbalance in Congress led to the 1820 [[Missouri Compromise]] that required states to be admitted to the union in pairs, one slave and one free.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3narr6.html |title=Growth and Entrenchment of Slavery |work=Brotherly Love |publisher=PBS |accessdate=June 16, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 1850 after winning the Mexican war a crisis gripped the nation what to do about the territories won from Mexico. Henry Clay, the man behind the compromise of 1820, once more rose to the challenge to craft the compromise of 1850. In this compromise the territories of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada would be organized but the issue of slavery would be decided later. Washington D.C would abolish the slave trade but not slavery itself. California would be admitted as a free state but the South would receive a new fugitive slave act which required Northerners to return slaves who escaped to the North to their owners. The compromise of 1850 would maintain a shaky peace until the election of Lincoln in 1860.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Compromise of 1850 and the Fugitive Slave Act|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2951.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1851 the battle between slaves and slave owners was met in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' tells the story of the life of a slave and the brutality that is faced by that life day after day. It would sell over 100,000 copies in its first year. The popularity of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' would solidify the North in its opposition to slavery. Lincoln would later invite Stowe to the White House in honor of this book that changed America.\n\nIn 1856 [[Charles Sumner]] a Massachusetts congressmen and antislavery leader was assaulted and nearly killed on the House floor by Preston Brooks of South Carolina.

At first, only a few thousand African Americans had their freedom. As the years went by, the number of blacks being freed expanded tremendously, building to 233,000 by the 1820s. They sometimes sued to gain their freedom or purchased it. Some slave owners had freed their bondspeople and a few state legislatures abolished slavery.<ref name=\"Carson 2007\"/>\n\nAfrican Americans tried to take the advantage of establishing homes and jobs in the cities.

These owners considered whites to be more reliable and educable. This resulted in many blacks performing unskilled labor. Black men worked as [[stevedore]]s, [[construction worker]], and as cellar-, well- and grave-diggers. As for black women workers, they worked as servants for white families. Some women were also cooks, seamstresses, basket-makers, midwives, teachers and nurses.<ref name=\"Carson 2007\"/> Black women worked as washerwomen or domestic servants for the white families. Some cities had independent black seamstresses, cooks, basketmakers, confectioners and more.\n\nWhile the African Americans left the thought of slavery behind, they made a priority to reunite with their family and friends. The cause of the Revolutionary War forced many blacks to migrate to the west afterwards, and the scourge of poverty created much difficulty with housing. African Americans competed with the Irish and Germans in jobs and had to share space with them.<ref name=\"Carson 2007\"/>\n\nWhile the majority of free blacks lived in poverty, some were able to establish successful businesses that catered to the Black community. [[Racial discrimination]] often meant that Blacks were not welcome or would be mistreated in White businesses and other establishments. To counter this, Blacks like [[James Forten]] developed their own communities with Black-owned businesses.

Leaders and plantation owners were also very concerned about the consequences Haiti's revolution would have on early America.

Although the Supreme Court has never explicitly overruled the Dred Scott case, the Court stated in the [[Slaughter-House Cases]] that at least one part of it had already been overruled by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in 1868, which begins by stating, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" <ref>[[Dred Scott v.

In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free.\" It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. The owners were never compensated. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves.<ref>Michael Vorenberg, ed.

In 1868, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th amendment]] granted full U.S. citizenship to African-Americans. The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th amendment]], ratified in 1870, extended the right to vote to black males.

Southern black men began to vote and were elected to the [[United States Congress]] and to local offices such as sheriff.  The safety provided by the troops did not last long, and white southerners frequently terrorized black voters. Coalitions of white and black Republicans passed bills to establish the first public school systems in most states of the South, although sufficient funding was hard to find.  Blacks established their own churches, towns and businesses.  Tens of thousands migrated to Mississippi for the chance to clear and own their own land, as 90% of the bottomlands were undeveloped. By the end of the 19th century, two-thirds of the farmers who owned land in the Mississippi Delta bottomlands were black.<ref>{{cite book |first=John C. |last=Willis |title=Forgotten Time: The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta after the Civil War |location=Charlottesville |publisher=University of Virginia |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8139-1971-3 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cotton field, by J.

As Joel Williamson puts it:\n<blockquote>Many of the migrants, women as well as men, came as teachers sponsored by a dozen or so benevolent societies, arriving in the still turbulent wake of Union armies.

They mandated de jure segregation in all public facilities, with a supposedly \"separate but equal\" status for black Americans. In reality, this led to treatment and accommodations that were usually inferior to those provided for white Americans, systematizing a number of economic, educational and social disadvantages.\n\nIn the face of years of mounting violence and intimidation directed at blacks as well as whites sympathetic to their cause, the U.S. government retreated from its pledge to guarantee constitutional protections to freedmen and women. When President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] withdrew Union troops from the South in 1877 as a result of a national compromise on the election, blacks lost most of their political power. Men like [[Benjamin \"Pap\" Singleton]] began speaking of leaving the South. This idea culminated in the 1879\u201380 movement of the [[Exodusters]], who migrated to Kansas, where blacks had much more freedom and it was easier to acquire land.\n\n[[File:1943 Colored Waiting Room Sign.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sign for \"Colored waiting room\", [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1943]]\nWhen Democrats took control of Tennessee in 1888, they passed laws making voter registration more complicated and ended the most competitive political state in the South.

As power became concentrated under the Democratic Party in the South, the party positioned itself as a private club and instituted [[white primaries]], closing blacks out of the only competitive contests. By 1910 one-party white rule was firmly established across the South.\n\nAlthough African Americans quickly started litigation to challenge such provisions, early court decisions at the state and national level went against them. In ''[[Williams v. Mississippi]]'' (1898), the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] upheld state provisions. This encouraged other Southern states to adopt similar measures over the next few years, as noted above. [[Booker T. Washington]], of [[Tuskegee Institute]] secretly worked with Northern supporters to raise funds and provide representation for African Americans in additional cases, such as ''[[Giles v. Harris]]'' (1903) and ''[[Giles v. Teasley]]'' (1904), but again the Supreme Court upheld the states.<ref name=\"papers.ssrn.com\"/>\n\nSegregation for the first time became a standard legal process in the South; it was informal in Northern cities. Jim Crow limited black access to transportation, schools, restaurants and other public facilities. Most southern blacks for decades continued to struggle in grinding poverty as agricultural, domestic and menial laborers. Many became [[sharecropper]]s, sharing the crop with the white land owners..\n\n===Racial terrorism===\nIn 1865, the [[Ku Klux Klan]], a secret [[vigilante]] organization dedicated to destroying the Republican Party in the South, especially by terrorizing black leaders, was formed. Klansmen hid behind masks and robes to hide their identity while they carried out violence and property damage. The Klan used [[terrorism]], especially murder and threats of murder, arson and intimidation. The Klan's excesses led to the passage of legislation against it, and with Federal enforcement, it was destroyed by 1871.<ref>Allen W. Trelease, '' White Terror: The Ku Klux Klan Conspiracy and Southern Reconstruction'' (1995)</ref>\n\nThe anti-Republican and anti-freedmen sentiment only briefly went underground, as violence arose in other incidents, especially after Louisiana's disputed state election in 1872, which contributed to the [[Colfax massacre|Colfax]] and [[Coushatta massacre]]s in [[Louisiana]] in 1873 and 1874. Tensions and rumors were high in many parts of the South. When violence erupted, African Americans consistently were killed at a much higher rate than were European Americans. Historians of the 20th century have renamed events long called \"riots\" in southern history. The common stories featured whites heroically saving the community from marauding blacks. Upon examination of the evidence, historians have called numerous such events \"massacres\", as at Colfax, because of the disproportionate number of fatalities for blacks as opposed to whites. The mob violence there resulted in 40\u201350 blacks dead for each of the three whites killed.<ref name=\"ftp.rootsweb.com\">[http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/la/state/history/military/uncat/colfaxr.txt \"Military Report on Colfax Riot, 1875\", from the ''Congressional Record''], accessed 6 April 2008. A state historical marker erected in 1950 noted that 150 blacks died and three whites.</ref>\n\nWhile not as widely known as the Klan, the [[paramilitary organizations]] that arose in the South during the mid-1870s as the white Democrats mounted a stronger insurgency, were more directed and effective than the Klan in challenging Republican governments, suppressing the black vote and achieving political goals. Unlike the Klan, paramilitary members operated openly, often solicited newspaper coverage, and had distinct political goals: to turn Republicans out of office and suppress or dissuade black voting in order to regain power in 1876. Groups included the [[White League]], that started from white militias in Grant Parish, Louisiana, in 1874 and spread in the [[Deep South]]; the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], that started in [[Mississippi]] in 1875 but had chapters arise and was prominent in the 1876 election campaign in [[South Carolina]], as well as in [[North Carolina]]; and other White Line organizations such as rifle clubs.<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2007, pp. 70\u201376.</ref>\n\nThe [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] era accompanied the most cruel wave of \"racial\" suppression that America has yet experienced.  Between 1890 and 1940, millions of African Americans were disenfranchised, killed, and brutalized. According to newspaper records kept at the [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]], about 5,000 men, women, and children were murdered in documented extrajudicial mob violence &mdash;called \"[[lynchings]].\"  The journalist [[Ida B. Wells]] estimated that lynchings not reported by the newspapers, plus similar executions under the veneer of \"[[due process]]\", may have amounted to about 20,000 killings.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nOf the tens of thousands of lynchers and onlookers during this period, it is reported that fewer than 50 whites were ever indicted for their crimes, and only four were sentenced. Because blacks were disenfranchised, they could not sit on juries or have any part in the political process, including local offices. Meanwhile, the lynchings were used as a weapon of terror to keep millions of African-Americans living in a constant state of anxiety and fear.<ref>For the story of the lynchings, see Philip Dray, ''At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America'' (New York: Random House, 2002).

Du Bois]] and 28 other prominent, African-American men met secretly at [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]]. There, they produced a manifesto calling for an end to racial discrimination, full civil liberties for African Americans and recognition of human brotherhood. The organization they established came to be called the [[Niagara Movement]]. After the notorious [[Springfield, Illinois]] race riot of 1908, a group of concerned Whites joined with the leadership of the Niagara Movement and formed the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) a year later, in 1909. Under the leadership of Du Bois, the NAACP mounted legal challenges to segregation and lobbied legislatures on behalf of black Americans.\n\nWhile the NAACP use the court system to promote equality, at the local level African Americans adopted a self-help strategy. They pooled their resources to create independent community and institutional lives for themselves. They established schools, churches, social welfare institutions, banks, [[African-American newspapers]] and small businesses to serve the needs of their communities.<ref>August Meier, \"Booker T.

Standards of beauty were different for whites and blacks, and the black community developed its own standards, with an emphasis on hair care. Beauticians could work out of their own homes, and did not need storefronts. As a result, black beauticians were numerous in the rural South, despite the absence of cities and towns. They pioneered the use of cosmetics, at a time when rural white women in the South avoided them. As Blain Roberts has shown, beauticians offered their clients a space to feel pampered and beautiful in the context of their own community because, \"Inside black beauty shops, rituals of beautification converged with rituals of socialization.\" Beauty contests emerged in the 1920s, and in the white community they were linked to agricultural county fairs. By contrast in the black community, beauty contests were developed out of the homecoming ceremonies at their high schools and colleges.<ref>Blain Roberts, ''Pageants, Parlors, and Pretty Women: Race and Beauty in the Twentieth-Century South'' (2014), quote p 96.

Still, African Americans played a significant role in America's war effort. Four African American regiments were integrated into French units because the French suffered heavy losses and badly needed men after three years of a terrible war. One of the most distinguished units was the [[369th Infantry Regiment]], known as the \"Harlem Hellfighters\", which was on the front lines for six months, longer than any other American unit in the war. 171 members of the 369th were awarded the [[Legion of Merit]].\n\nFrom May 1918 to November 1918, the 371st and 372nd African American Regiments were integrated under the 157th Red Hand Division<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigations/602_redhandflag.html|title=Red Hand Flag - History Detectives - PBS|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> commanded by the French General [[Mariano Goybet]].

Based on findings from this investigation, the Army Decorations Board approved the award of the Medal of Honor to Stowers.

Hundreds of thousands of African-Americans took the trains to Northern industrial centers in a dramatic historical event known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns in western Pennsylvania between 1890 and 1930 faced racial discrimination and limited economic opportunities. The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910.  Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities. <ref>Joe W.

They formed migration clubs, pooled their money, bought tickets at reduced rates, and often moved ingroups. Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.<ref>Trotter, \"Reflections on the Great Migration to Western Pennsylvania,\" p 154.</ref>\n\nAfter the war ended and the soldiers returned home, tensions were very high, with serious labor union strikes and inter-racial riots in major cities.

Roosevelt argued to Randolph that he could not antagonize the powerful bloc of conservative Southern Democrats in Congress, and desegregation of the military was out of the question as the Southern Democrats would never accept it; by contrast, as La Guardia pointed out, most of the factories in the defense industry were located in California, the Midwest and the Northeast.<ref name=\"Kennedy, David p. 767\"/>\n\n===Cotton===\nThe largest group of blacks worked in the cotton farms of the Deep South as sharecroppers or tenant farmers; a few owned their farms. Large numbers of whites also were tenant farmers and [[sharecroppers]]. [[Tenant farmer|Tenant farming]] characterized the cotton and tobacco production in the post-Civil War South. As the agricultural economy plummeted in the early 1930s, all farmers in all parts of the nation were badly hurt. Worst hurt were the tenant farmers (who had relatively more control) and sharecroppers (who had less control), as well as daily laborers (mostly black, with least control).<ref>Anthony J. Badger, ''The New Deal'' (1989), pp. 147\u201389.</ref>\n\nThe problem was very low prices for farm products and the New Deal solution was to raise them by cutting production. It accomplished this in the South by the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act|AAA]], which gave landowners acreage reduction contracts, by which they were paid to ''not'' grow cotton or tobacco on a portion of their land. By law, they were required to pay the tenant farmers and sharecroppers on their land a portion of the money, but some cheated on this provision, hurting their tenants and croppers. The farm wage workers who worked directly for the landowner were mostly the ones who lost their jobs. For most tenants and sharecroppers the AAA was a major help. Researchers at the time concluded, \"To the extent that the AAA control-program has been responsible for the increased price [of cotton], we conclude that it has increased the amount of goods and services consumed by the cotton tenants and croppers.\" Furthermore, the landowners typically let their tenants and croppers use the land taken out of production for their own personal use in growing food and feed crops, which further increased their standard of living. Another consequence was that the historic high levels of turnover from year to year declined sharply, as tenants and coppers tend to stay with the same landowner. Researchers concluded, \"As a rule, planters seem to prefer Negroes to whites as tenants and coppers.\"<ref>Fred C. Frey and T.

As a result, African-Americans left the South in large numbers to munitions centers in the North and West to take advantage of the shortages caused by the war, sparking the [[Second Great Migration]]. While they somewhat lived in better conditions than the South (for instance, they could vote and send children to better schools), they nevertheless faced widespread discrimination due to bigotry and fear of competition of housing and jobs among white residents.\n\nWhen Roosevelt learned that many companies in the defense industry were violating the spirit, if not the letter of Executive Order 8802 by only employing blacks in menial positions such as janitors and denying them the opportunity to work as highly paid skilled laborers, he significantly strengthened the [[Fair Employment Practice Committee]] (FEPC) with orders to fine the corporations that did not treat their black employees equally.<ref name=\"Kennedy, David p.775\">Kennedy, David ''Freedom from Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p.775</ref> In 1943, Roosevelt gave the FEPC a budget of half-million dollars and replaced the unpaid volunteers who had previously staffed the FEPC with a paid staff concentrated in regional headquarters across the nation with instructions to inspect the defense industry's factories to ensure the spirit and letter of Executive Order 8802 was being obeyed.<ref name=\"Kennedy, David p.775\"/> Roosevelt believed that having black men and women employed in the defense industry working as skilled laborers would give them far higher wages than what they ever had before, and ultimately form the nucleus of a black middle class.<ref name=\"Kennedy, David p.775\"/> When the president learned that some unions were pushing for black employees to be given menial \"auxiliary\" jobs in the factories, he instructed the [[National Labor Relations Board]] to decertify those unions.<ref name=\"Kennedy, David p.775\"/> In 1944, when the union for trolley drivers in Philadelphia went on strike to protest plans to hire Afro-Americans as trolley drivers, Roosevelt sent in troops to break the strike.<ref name=\"Kennedy, David p.775\"/> In 1942, blacks made up 3% of the workforce in the defense industry; by 1945 blacks made up 8% of the workforce in defense industry factories (blacks made up 10% of the population).<ref name=\"Kennedy, David p.775\"/>       \n  \nRacial tensions were also high between whites and ethnic minorities that cities like [[Chicago]], [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)|Detroit]], [[Zoot Suit Riots|Los Angeles]], and [[Harlem Riot of 1943|Harlem]] experienced [[race riot]]s in 1943.<ref>Wynn, ''African American Experience During World War II'' (2011), pp. 25\u201342, 63\u201380.</ref> In May 1943, in Mobile, Alabama, when the local shipyard promoted some black men up to be trained as welders, white workers rioted and seriously injured 11 of their black co-workers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In Los Angeles, the Zoot Suit riots of 3\u20138 June 1943 saw white servicemen attacking ''Chicano'' (Mexican-American) and black youths for wearing [[zoot suits]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> On 15 June 1943, in Beaumont, Texas, a [[Beaumont race riot of 1943|pogrom]] saw a white mob smash up black homes while lynching 2 black men.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In Detroit, which expanded massively during the war years with 50, 000 blacks from the South and 200, 000 \"hillbilly\" whites from [[Appalachia]] moving to the city to work in the factories, competition for sparse rental housing had pushed tensions to the brink.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> On 20 June 1943, false rumors that a white mob had lynched 3 black men led to an outbreak of racial rioting in Detroit that left 34 dead, of whom 25 were black.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> On 1\u20132 August 1943, another [[Harlem riot of 1943|race riot]] in Harlem left 6 blacks dead.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nPolitically, blacks left the Republican Party and joined the Democratic [[New Deal Coalition]] of President [[Franklin D.

Some historians prefer to distinguish between the movements for those reasons.\n\nIn the Second Great Migration, more than five million African Americans moved to cities in states in the Northeast, Midwest, and West, including the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where many skilled jobs in the defense industry were concentrated. More of these migrants were already urban laborers who came from the cities of the South. They were better educated and had better skills than people who did not migrate.<ref name=\"AAME\"/>\n\nCompared to the more rural migrants of the period 1910\u201340, many African Americans in the South were already living in urban areas and had urban job skills before they relocated. They moved to take jobs in the burgeoning industrial cities and especially the many jobs in the defense industry during World War II. Workers who were limited to segregated, low-skilled jobs in Southern cities were able to get highly skilled, well-paid jobs at West Coast shipyards.<ref name=\"AAME\"/>  The effect of racially homogeneous communities composed largely of migrant blacks that formed because of spatial segregation in destination cities was that they were largely influenced by the Southern culture they brought with them. The food, music and even the discriminatory white police presence in these neighborhoods were all imported to a certain extent from the collective experiences of the highly concentrated African American migrants.<ref>Rutkoff, Peter M., and William B. Scott. ''Fly Away: The Great African American Cultural Migrations''. (Johns Hopkins UP, (2010)</ref>  Writers have often assumed that Southern migrants contributed disproportionately to changes in the African-American family in the inner city. However, census data  for 1940 through 1990 show that these families actually exhibited more traditional family patterns - more children living with two parents, more ever-married women living with their spouses, and fewer never-married mothers.<ref>Stewart E.

Fifty-three percent remained in the Southern United States, while 40 percent lived in the Northeast and North Central states and 7 percent in the West.<ref name=\"AAME\"/>\n\n==Civil Rights Movement==\n{{Main|Civil Rights Movement}}\nThe [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] handed down a landmark decision in the case of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) of [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]]. This decision applied to public facilities, especially public schools. Reforms  occurred slowly and only after concerted activism by African Americans. The ruling also brought new momentum to the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. [[Boycott]]s against segregated public transportation systems sprang up in the South, the most notable of which was the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]].\n\nCivil rights groups such as the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) organized across the South with tactics such as boycotts, voter registration campaigns, [[Freedom Rides]] and other nonviolent direct action, such as marches, pickets and sit-ins to mobilize around issues of equal access and voting rights. Southern segregationists fought back to block reform. The conflict grew to involve steadily escalating physical violence, bombings and intimidation by Southern whites. Law enforcement responded to protesters with batons, electric cattle prods, fire hoses, attack dogs and mass arrests.\n\nIn [[Virginia]], state legislators, school board members and other public officials mounted a campaign of obstructionism and outright defiance to integration called [[Massive Resistance]]. It entailed a series of actions to deny state funding to integrated schools and instead fund privately run \"segregation academies\" for white students. [[Farmville, Virginia]], in [[Prince Edward County, Virginia|Prince Edward County]], was one of the plaintiff African-American communities involved in the 1954 ''Brown v. Board of Education'' Supreme Court decision. As a last-ditch effort to avoid court-ordered desegregation, officials in the county shut down the county's entire public school system in 1959 and it remained closed for five years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercyseatfilms.com/filmcredits.html|title=Mercy Seat Films - 'THEY CLOSED OUR SCHOOLS' - Film Credits|website=Mercyseatfilms.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> White students were able to attend private schools established by the community for the sole purpose of circumventing integration. The largely black rural population of the county had little recourse.  Some families were split up as parents sent their children to live with relatives in other locales to attend public school; but the majority of Prince Edward's more than 2,000 black children, as well as many poor whites, simply remained unschooled until federal court action forced the schools to reopen five years later.\n\n[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|left|Dr. [[Martin Luther King]], Jr. delivers his famous \"[[I have a dream|I Have a Dream]]\" speech during the March on Washington]]\nPerhaps the high point of the Civil Rights Movement was the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], which brought more than 250,000 marchers to the grounds of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], to speak out for an end to southern racial violence and police brutality, equal opportunity in employment, equal access in education and public accommodations. The organizers of the march were called the \"[[Big Six (activists)|Big Six]]\" of the Civil Rights Movement: [[Bayard Rustin]] the strategist who has been called the \"invisible man\" of the Civil Rights Movement; labor organizer and initiator of the march, A. Phillip Randolph; [[Roy Wilkins]] of the NAACP; [[Whitney Young|Whitney Young, Jr.]], of the [[National Urban League]]; [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC); [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|James Farmer]] of the [[Congress on Racial Equality]] (CORE); and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). Also active behind the scenes and sharing the podium with Dr. King was [[Dorothy Height]], head of the [[National Council of Negro Women]]. It was at this event, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, that King delivered his historic \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech.\n\nThis march, the 1963 [[Birmingham campaign|Birmingham Children's Crusade]], and other events were credited with putting pressure on President [[John F. Kennedy]], and then [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], that culminated in the passage the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] that banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and labor unions.\n\n[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Civil Rights Act, July 2, 1964.jpg|thumb|250px|right|President Johnson signs the historic [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].]]\nThe \"Mississippi Freedom Summer\" of 1964 brought thousands of idealistic youth, black and white, to the state to run \"freedom schools\", to teach basic literacy, history and civics. Other volunteers were involved in voter registration drives. The season was marked by harassment, intimidation and violence directed at civil rights workers and their host families. The disappearance of three youths, [[James Chaney]], [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]] and [[Michael Schwerner]] in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], captured the attention of the nation. Six weeks later, searchers found the savagely beaten body of Chaney, a black man, in a muddy dam alongside the remains of his two white companions, who had been shot to death. There was national outrage at the escalating injustices of the \"Mississippi Blood Summer\", as it by then had come to be known, and at the brutality of the murders.\n\nIn 1965 the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma Voting Rights Movement]], its [[Selma to Montgomery marches]], and the tragic murders of two activists associated with the march, inspired President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] to call for the full [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which struck down barriers to black enfranchisement. In 1966 the [[Chicago Open Housing Movement]], followed by the passage of the [[1968 Civil Rights Act|1968 Fair Housing Act]], was a capstone to more than a decade of major legislation during the civil rights movement.\n\nBy this time, African Americans who questioned the effectiveness of nonviolent protest had gained a greater voice. More militant black leaders, such as [[Malcolm X]] of the [[Nation of Islam]] and [[Eldridge Cleaver]] of the [[Black Panther Party]], called for blacks to defend themselves, using violence, if necessary. From the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, the [[Black Power]] movement urged African Americans to look to Africa for inspiration and emphasized black solidarity, rather than integration.\n\n==Post Civil Rights era of African-American history==\n{{Main|Post-Civil Rights era in African-American history}}\n[[File:Official portrait of Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|right|The first [[African-American]] [[President of the United States]], [[Barack Obama]]]]\nPolitically and economically, blacks have made substantial strides in the post-civil rights era. Civil rights leader [[Jesse Jackson]], who ran for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988, brought unprecedented support and leverage to blacks in politics.\n\nIn 1989, [[Douglas Wilder]] became the first African-American elected governor in U.S. history. In 1992 [[Carol Moseley-Braun]] of [[Illinois]] became the first black woman elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. There were 8,936 black officeholders in the United States in 2000, showing a net increase of 7,467 since 1970. In 2001 there were 484 black mayors.\n\nThe 39 African-American members of Congress form the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], which serves as a political bloc for issues relating to African Americans. The appointment of blacks to high federal offices\u2014including General [[Colin Powell]], Chairman of the U.S. Armed Forces Joint Chiefs of Staff, 1989\u201393, [[United States Secretary of State]], 2001\u201305; [[Condoleezza Rice]], Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, 2001\u201304, Secretary of State in, 2005\u201309; [[Ron Brown]], [[United States Secretary of Commerce]], 1993\u201396; and Supreme Court justices [[Thurgood Marshall]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]\u2014also demonstrates the increasing visibility of blacks in the political arena.\n\nEconomic progress for blacks' reaching the extremes of wealth has been slow. According to Forbes richest lists, [[Oprah Winfrey]] was the richest African American of the 20th century and has been the world's only [[black billionaires|black billionaire]] in 2004, 2005, and 2006.<ref>Roy Douglas Malonson, [http://www.aframnews.com/html/2006-05-10/publisher.htm \"Condi and Oprah aren\u2019t good role models for Black motherhood\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520021215/http://www.aframnews.com/html/2006-05-10/publisher.htm |date=2006-05-20 }}. ''African-American News&Issues: Publisher's Analysis''. Retrieved 19 September 2013</ref> Not only was Winfrey the world's only black billionaire but she has been the only black on the [[Forbes 400]] list nearly every year since 1995. [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] founder [[Robert L. Johnson|Bob Johnson]]  briefly joined her on the list from 2001 to 2003 before his ex-wife acquired part of his fortune; although he returned to the list in 2006, he did not make it in 2007. With Winfrey the only African American wealthy enough to rank among America's 400 richest people,<ref>[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070920/apfn_forbes_400_alphabetical_list.html]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> blacks currently comprise 0.25% of America's economic elite and comprise 13% of the U.S. population.\n\nThe dramatic political breakthrough came in the 2008 election, with the election of [[Barack Obama]], the son of a black Kenyan father and a white American mother. He won overwhelming support from African-American voters in the Democratic primaries, even as his main opponent Hillary Clinton had the support of many black politicians. African Americans continued to support Obama throughout his term.<ref>Shayla C. Nunnally, \"African American Perspectives on the Obama Presidency,\" in William Crotty, ed. ''The Obama Presidency: Promise and Performance'' (2012), pp. 127\u201350.</ref> After completing his first term, Obama ran for a second term. In 2012, he won the presidential election against candidate [[Mitt Romney]] and was re-elected as the president of the United States.\n\nThe post-civil rights era is also notable for the [[New Great Migration]], in which millions of African Americans have returned to the South including [[Texas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]] and [[North Carolina]], often to pursue increased economic opportunities in now-desegregated southern cities.\n\n===Social issues===\nAfter the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gains of the 1950s\u20131970s, due to government neglect, unfavorable social policies, high [[poverty in the United States|poverty rates]], changes implemented in the [[criminal justice]] system and laws, and a breakdown in traditional family units, African-American communities have been suffering from extremely high [[incarceration in the United States|incarceration rates]].

During [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] and the late 19th century, blacks became major actors in the South. The [[Dunning School]] of white scholars generally cast the blacks as pawns of white Carpetbaggers during this period, but [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], a black historian, and [[Ulrich B. Phillips]], a white historian, studied the African-American experience in depth. Du Bois' study of Reconstruction provided a more objective context for evaluating its achievements and weaknesses; in addition, he did studies of contemporary black life. Phillips set the main topics of inquiry that still guide the analysis of slave economics.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, [[Carter G. Woodson]] was the major black scholar studying and promoting the black historical experience. Woodson insisted that the study of African descendants be scholarly sound, creative, restorative, and, most important, directly relevant to the black community. He popularized black history with a variety of innovative strategies, including Association for the Study of Negro Life outreach activities, Negro History Week (now [[Black History Month]], in February), and a popular black history magazine. Woodson democratized, legitimized, and popularized black history.<ref>Pero Gaglo Dagbovie, \"Making Black History Practical and Popular: Carter G. Woodson, the Proto Black Studies Movement, and the Struggle for Black Liberation.\" ''Western Journal of Black Studies'' 2004 28(2): 372\u2013383. {{ISSN|0197-4327}} Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]</ref>\n\n[[Benjamin Quarles]] (1904\u201396) had a significant impact on the teaching of African-American history. Quarles and [[John Hope Franklin]] provided a bridge between the work of historians in [[historically black colleges]], such as Woodson, and the black history that is now well established in mainline universities. Quarles grew up in Boston, attended [[Shaw University]] as an undergraduate, and received a graduate degree at the [[University of Wisconsin]]. He began in 1953 teaching at [[Morgan State College]] in Baltimore, where he stayed, despite a lucrative offer from [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Quarles' books included ''The Negro in the American Revolution'' (1961), ''Black Abolitionists'' (1969), ''The Negro in the Civil War'' (1953), and ''Lincoln and the Negro'' (1962), which were narrative accounts of critical wartime episodes that focused on how blacks interacted with their white allies.<ref>Meier, August, \"Benjamin Quarles and the Historiography of Black America,\" ''Civil War History,'' June 1980, Vol. 26, No. 2, pp. 101\u2013116.</ref>\n\nBlack history attempted to reverse centuries of ignorance. While black historians were not alone in advocating a new examination of slavery and racism in the United States, the study of African-American history has often been a political and scholarly struggle to change assumptions. One of the foremost assumptions was that slaves were passive and did not rebel. A series of historians transformed the image of African Americans, revealing a much richer and complex experience. Historians such as [[Leon F. Litwack]] showed how former slaves fought to keep their families together and struggled against tremendous odds to define themselves as free people. Others wrote of rebellions small and large.\n\nIn the 21st century, black history is regarded as mainstream.  Since proclamation by President [[Jimmy Carter]], it is celebrated every February in the United States during \"Black History Month.\" Proponents of black history believe that it promotes diversity, develops self-esteem, and corrects myths and stereotypes. Opponents argue such curricula are dishonest, divisive, and lack academic credibility and rigor.<ref>Abul Pitre and Ruth Ray, \"The Controversy Around Black History,\" ''Western Journal of Black Studies'' 2002 26(3): 149\u2013154. {{ISSN|0197-4327}} Fulltext: Ebsco.</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of black history===\nSurveys of 11th and 12th-grade students and adults in 2005 show that American schools have given students an awareness of some famous figures in black history.  Both groups were asked to name 10 famous Americans, excluding presidents. Of those named, the three most mentioned were black: 67% named Martin Luther King, 60% Rosa Parks, and 44% Harriet Tubman. Among adults, King was second (at 36%) and Parks was tied for fourth with 30%, while Tubman tied for 10th place with Henry Ford, at 16%. When distinguished historians were asked in 2006 to name the most prominent Americans, Parks and Tubman did not make the top 100.<ref>Sam Wineburg and Chauncey Monte-Sano, \"'Famous Americans': The Changing Pantheon of American Heroes,\" ''Journal of American History'' (March 2008), 94#4, pp. 1186\u20131202.</ref>\n\n===Scholars of African-American history===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n* [[Herbert Aptheker]]\n* [[Lerone Bennett, Jr.]]\n* [[Ira Berlin]]\n* [[John Wesley Blassingame]]\n* [[John Henrik Clarke]]\n* [[W.

This gave crewmen easy access to the women which was often regarded as one of the perks of the trade system.<ref name=\"white\" /> Not only did these rooms give the crewmen easy access to women but it gave enslaved women better access to information on the ship's crew, fortifications, and daily routine, but little opportunity to communicate this to the men confined in the ship's hold.<ref name=\"white\" /> As an example, women instigated a 1797 insurrection aboard the British ship ''Thomas'' by stealing weapons and passing them to the men below as well as engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the ship's crew.<ref name=\"white\" />\n\nIn the midst of these terrible conditions, African slaves plotted mutiny.

[[Massachusetts]] was the first colony to legalize slavery in 1641. Other colonies followed suit by passing laws that passed slavery on to the children of slaves and making non-Christian imported servants slaves for life.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAfricans first arrived in 1619, when a Dutch ship sold 19 blacks to Englishmen at [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] (today's [[Fort Monroe]]), thirty miles downstream from Jamestown, Virginia. In all, about 10\u201312 million Africans were transported to the Western Hemisphere. The vast majority of these people came from that stretch of the West African coast extending from present-day Senegal to Angola; a small percentage came from Madagascar and East Africa. Only 5% (about 500,000) went to the American colonies. The vast majority went to the West Indies and Brazil, where they died quickly. Demographic conditions were highly favorable in the American colonies, with less disease, more food, some medical care, and lighter work loads than prevailed in the sugar fields.<ref>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Kolchin |title=American Slavery, 1619\u20131877 |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |year=2003 |isbn=978-0809016303 }}</ref>\n\nAt first the Africans in the South were outnumbered by white indentured servants, who came voluntarily from Britain. They avoided the plantations. With the vast amount of good land and the shortage of laborers,  plantation owners turned to lifetime slaves who worked for their keep but were not paid wages and could not easily escape. Slaves had some legal rights (it was a crime to kill a slave, and a few whites were hanged for it.) Generally the slaves developed their own family system, religion and customs in the slave quarters with little interference from owners, who were only interested in work outputs. Before the 1660s, the North American mainland colonies were expanding, but still fairly small in size and did not have a great demand for labour, so the colonists did not import large numbers of African slaves at this point.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== Black population in 1700s ===\nBy 1700 there were 25,000 black slaves in the North American mainland colonies, about 10% of the population. Some had been shipped directly from Africa (most of them were from 1518 to the 1850s), but initially, very often they had been shipped via the West Indies in small cargoes after spending time working on the islands.<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\">John Murrin, Paul Johnson, James McPherson, Alice Fahs, Gary Gerstle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CRwJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT151  \"Expansion, Immigration, and Regional Differentiation\"], in ''Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People, Volume 1: To 1877'', Cengage Learning, 2011, p. 108.</ref> At the same time, many were native born on the North American mainland. Their legal status was now clear: they were slaves for life and so were the children of slave mothers. As white settlers began to claim and clear more land for large-scale farming and plantations, the number of slaves imported directly from Africa began to rapidly increase between the 1660s into the 1700s and onward, since the trade in slaves coming in from the West Indies was much too small to meet the huge demand for the now fast-growing North-American mainland slave market. Additionally, most American slave-buyers no longer wanted slaves coming in from the West Indies - by now they were either harder to obtain, too expensive, undesirable, or more often, ruined in many ways by the very brutal regime of the island sugar plantations. By the end of the seventeenth century, a relaxation of colonial tax laws, and the British Crown's removal of monopolies that had been granted to a very small number of British slave-traders like the Royal African Company, had made the direct slave trade with Africa much easier. As a result, freshly imported, young, and healthy Africans were now much more affordable, cheaper in price, and more readily available in large numbers to American slave buyers, who by now preferred to purchase them, even if it took some time for them to adjust to a new life as plantation slaves. From about 1700 to 1859, the majority of slaves imported to the North American mainland came directly from Africa in huge cargoes to fill the massive spike in demand for much-needed labour to work the continually expanding plantations in the Southern colonies (later to be states), with most heading to Virginia, South Carolina, and French or Spanish Louisiana.<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\"/> Unlike in the South, the Northern colonies developed into much more urbanized and industrialized societies, and they relied less on agriculture as the main economy, so, therefore, they did not import many African slaves, and the black population there remained fairly low for a very long time. However, big Northern cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Boston, had relatively large black populations (slave or free) for most of the colonial period and thereafter.\n\nFrom the 1750s, American-born slaves of African descent already began to outnumber African-born slaves. By the time of the American Revolution, a few of the Northern states had begun to consider abolishing slavery, and some Southern states like Virginia had produced such large and self-sustaining locally-born slave populations by natural increase, that they stopped taking in, direct imports of slaves from Africa altogether (but still kept slavery, which continued in the South). However, other Southern states like Georgia and South Carolina still relied on constant, fresh supplies of slave labour to keep up with the demand of their burgeoning plantation economies, so they continued to allow the direct importation of slaves from Africa right up to 1808, only stopping for a few years in the 1770s, because of a temporary lull in the trade brought on by the American Revolutionary War. The continued, direct importation of slaves from Africa ensured that for most of the eighteenth century, South Carolina's black population remained very high, with blacks outnumbering whites three to one, unlike in Virginia, which had a white majority, despite its large black slave population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/ethnography/aah/aaheritage/lowCountryA.htm|title=NPS Ethnography: African American Heritage & Ethnography|website=Nps.gov|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> It was said that South Carolina in the eighteenth century as a British colony looked much more like an extension of West Africa than it did of Britain. All legal, direct importation of slaves from Africa had stopped by 1808, when the now, newly formed United States finally banned its citizens from participating in the international slave trade altogether by law.

The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], a document that would become a [[manifesto]] for human rights and personal freedom, was written by [[Thomas Jefferson]], who owned over 200 slaves. Other Southern statesmen were also major slaveholders. The [[Second Continental Congress]] did consider freeing slaves to disrupt British commerce. They removed language from the Declaration of Independence that included the promotion of slavery amongst the offenses of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. A number of free Blacks, most notably [[Prince Hall]]\u2014the founder of [[Prince Hall Freemasonry]], submitted [[petitions]] for the end of slavery.

In South Carolina 25,000 slaves, more than one-quarter of the total, escaped to join and fight with the British, or fled for freedom in the uproar of war.  Thousands of slaves also escaped in Georgia and Virginia, as well as New England and New York.  Well-known [[Black Loyalist]] soldiers include [[Colonel Tye]] and [[Boston King]].\n\nThe Americans eventually won the war.

Additionally, free blacks' rights were also restricted in many places. Most were denied the right to vote and were excluded from public schools. Some Blacks sought to fight these contradictions in court. In 1780, [[Elizabeth Freeman (Mum Bett)|Elizabeth Freeman]] and [[Quock Walker]] used language from the new [[Massachusetts]] constitution that declared all men were born free and equal in [[freedom suits]] to gain release from slavery.

Beginning in the 1750s, there was widespread sentiment during the American Revolution that slavery was a social evil (for the country as a whole and for the whites) that should eventually be abolished.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} All the Northern states passed emancipation acts between 1780 and 1804; most of these arranged for gradual emancipation and a special status for [[freedmen]], so there were still a dozen \"permanent apprentices\" into the 19th century.

By 1810, that number had risen to 186,446. Most of these were in the North, but Revolutionary sentiments also motivated Southern slaveholders.\n\nFor 20 years after the Revolution, more Southerners also freed slaves, sometimes by manumission or in wills to be accomplished after the slaveholder's death.  In the Upper South, the percentage of free blacks rose from about 1% before the Revolution to more than 10% by 1810. [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] worked to persuade slaveholders to free families. In Virginia the number of free blacks increased from 10,000 in 1790 to nearly 30,000 in 1810, but 95% of blacks were still enslaved.

Central to the growth of community among blacks was the [[Black church]], usually the first communal institution to be established. The Black church- was both an expression of community and unique African-American spirituality, and a reaction to discrimination. The churches also served as neighborhood centers where free black people could celebrate their African heritage without intrusion from white detractors.  The church also served as the center of education. Since the church was part of the community and wanted to provide education; it educated the freed and enslaved Blacks.

[[Pennsylvania]] was the first, in 1780 passing an act for gradual abolition.<ref>Edward Raymond Turner, \"The Abolition of Slavery in Pennsylvania.\" ''Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'' (1912): 129\u2013142. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20085586 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nA number of events continued to shape views on slavery. One of these events was the [[Haitian Revolution]], which was the only slave revolt that led to an independent country.

The industrial revolution in Europe and New England generated a heavy demand for cotton for cheap clothing, which caused an exponential demand for slave labor to develop new [[cotton plantation]]s. There was a 70% increase in the number of slaves in the United States in only 20 years. They were overwhelmingly concentrated on plantations in the [[Deep South]], and moved west as old cotton fields lost their productivity and new lands were purchased. Unlike the Northern States who put more focus into manufacturing and commerce, the South was heavily dependent on agriculture.<ref>Douglas R, Egerton, \"Slaves to the Marketplace: Economic Liberty and Black Rebelliousness in the Atlantic World.\" ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 26, no. 4 (Winter 2006): 617\u2013639.</ref> Southern political economists at this time supported the institution by concluding that nothing was inherently contradictory about owning slaves and that a future of slavery existed even if the South were to industrialize.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carlander|first=Jay|author2=Elliot Brownlee|title=Antebellum Southern Political Economists and the Problem of Slavery|journal=American Nineteenth Century History|date=September 2006|volume=7|issue=3|pages=393 |doi=10.1080/14664650600956585}}</ref>  Racial, economic, and political turmoil reached an all-time high regarding slavery up to the events of the Civil War.\n\nIn 1807, at the urging of President [[Thomas Jefferson]], Congress abolished the international slave trade. While American Blacks celebrated this as a victory in the fight against slavery, the ban increased the demand for slaves. Changing agricultural practices in the Upper South from tobacco to mixed farming decreased labor requirements, and slaves were sold to traders for the developing Deep South. In addition, the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]] allowed any Black person to be claimed as a runaway unless a White person testified on their behalf. A number of free Blacks, especially [[indentured servants|indentured]] children, were [[kidnap]]ped and sold into slavery with little or no hope of rescue. By 1819 there were exactly 11 free and 11 slave states, which increased [[sectionalism]]. Fears of an imbalance in Congress led to the 1820 [[Missouri Compromise]] that required states to be admitted to the union in pairs, one slave and one free.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3narr6.html |title=Growth and Entrenchment of Slavery |work=Brotherly Love |publisher=PBS |accessdate=June 16, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 1850 after winning the Mexican war a crisis gripped the nation what to do about the territories won from Mexico. Henry Clay, the man behind the compromise of 1820, once more rose to the challenge to craft the compromise of 1850. In this compromise the territories of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada would be organized but the issue of slavery would be decided later. Washington D.C would abolish the slave trade but not slavery itself. California would be admitted as a free state but the South would receive a new fugitive slave act which required Northerners to return slaves who escaped to the North to their owners. The compromise of 1850 would maintain a shaky peace until the election of Lincoln in 1860.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Compromise of 1850 and the Fugitive Slave Act|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2951.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=April 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1851 the battle between slaves and slave owners was met in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

The popularity of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' would solidify the North in its opposition to slavery. Lincoln would later invite Stowe to the White House in honor of this book that changed America.\n\nIn 1856 [[Charles Sumner]] a Massachusetts congressmen and antislavery leader was assaulted and nearly killed on the House floor by Preston Brooks of South Carolina. Brooks received praise in the South for his actions while being condemned in the North and Sumner became an iconic martyr in the North.

At first, only a few thousand African Americans had their freedom. As the years went by, the number of blacks being freed expanded tremendously, building to 233,000 by the 1820s. They sometimes sued to gain their freedom or purchased it. Some slave owners had freed their bondspeople and a few state legislatures abolished slavery.<ref name=\"Carson 2007\"/>\n\nAfrican Americans tried to take the advantage of establishing homes and jobs in the cities.

These owners considered whites to be more reliable and educable. This resulted in many blacks performing unskilled labor. Black men worked as [[stevedore]]s, [[construction worker]], and as cellar-, well- and grave-diggers. As for black women workers, they worked as servants for white families. Some women were also cooks, seamstresses, basket-makers, midwives, teachers and nurses.<ref name=\"Carson 2007\"/> Black women worked as washerwomen or domestic servants for the white families. Some cities had independent black seamstresses, cooks, basketmakers, confectioners and more.\n\nWhile the African Americans left the thought of slavery behind, they made a priority to reunite with their family and friends. The cause of the Revolutionary War forced many blacks to migrate to the west afterwards, and the scourge of poverty created much difficulty with housing. African Americans competed with the Irish and Germans in jobs and had to share space with them.<ref name=\"Carson 2007\"/>\n\nWhile the majority of free blacks lived in poverty, some were able to establish successful businesses that catered to the Black community. [[Racial discrimination]] often meant that Blacks were not welcome or would be mistreated in White businesses and other establishments. To counter this, Blacks like [[James Forten]] developed their own communities with Black-owned businesses.

Slaves rallied around these ideas with rebellions against their masters as well as white bystanders during the [[Denmark Vesey|Denmark Vesey Conspiracy of 1822]] and the [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion|Nat Turner Rebellion of 1831]]. Leaders and plantation owners were also very concerned about the consequences Haiti's revolution would have on early America.

Although the Supreme Court has never explicitly overruled the Dred Scott case, the Court stated in the [[Slaughter-House Cases]] that at least one part of it had already been overruled by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in 1868, which begins by stating, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" <ref>[[Dred Scott v.

In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free.\" It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. The owners were never compensated. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves.<ref>Michael Vorenberg, ed.

The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th amendment]], ratified in 1870, extended the right to vote to black males.

Southern black men began to vote and were elected to the [[United States Congress]] and to local offices such as sheriff.  The safety provided by the troops did not last long, and white southerners frequently terrorized black voters. Coalitions of white and black Republicans passed bills to establish the first public school systems in most states of the South, although sufficient funding was hard to find.  Blacks established their own churches, towns and businesses.  Tens of thousands migrated to Mississippi for the chance to clear and own their own land, as 90% of the bottomlands were undeveloped. By the end of the 19th century, two-thirds of the farmers who owned land in the Mississippi Delta bottomlands were black.<ref>{{cite book |first=John C. |last=Willis |title=Forgotten Time: The Yazoo-Mississippi Delta after the Civil War |location=Charlottesville |publisher=University of Virginia |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8139-1971-3 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cotton field, by J.

As Joel Williamson puts it:\n<blockquote>Many of the migrants, women as well as men, came as teachers sponsored by a dozen or so benevolent societies, arriving in the still turbulent wake of Union armies.

They mandated de jure segregation in all public facilities, with a supposedly \"separate but equal\" status for black Americans. In reality, this led to treatment and accommodations that were usually inferior to those provided for white Americans, systematizing a number of economic, educational and social disadvantages.\n\nIn the face of years of mounting violence and intimidation directed at blacks as well as whites sympathetic to their cause, the U.S. government retreated from its pledge to guarantee constitutional protections to freedmen and women. When President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] withdrew Union troops from the South in 1877 as a result of a national compromise on the election, blacks lost most of their political power. Men like [[Benjamin \"Pap\" Singleton]] began speaking of leaving the South. This idea culminated in the 1879\u201380 movement of the [[Exodusters]], who migrated to Kansas, where blacks had much more freedom and it was easier to acquire land.\n\n[[File:1943 Colored Waiting Room Sign.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sign for \"Colored waiting room\", [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1943]]\nWhen Democrats took control of Tennessee in 1888, they passed laws making voter registration more complicated and ended the most competitive political state in the South.

As power became concentrated under the Democratic Party in the South, the party positioned itself as a private club and instituted [[white primaries]], closing blacks out of the only competitive contests. By 1910 one-party white rule was firmly established across the South.\n\nAlthough African Americans quickly started litigation to challenge such provisions, early court decisions at the state and national level went against them. In ''[[Williams v. Mississippi]]'' (1898), the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] upheld state provisions. This encouraged other Southern states to adopt similar measures over the next few years, as noted above. [[Booker T. Washington]], of [[Tuskegee Institute]] secretly worked with Northern supporters to raise funds and provide representation for African Americans in additional cases, such as ''[[Giles v. Harris]]'' (1903) and ''[[Giles v. Teasley]]'' (1904), but again the Supreme Court upheld the states.<ref name=\"papers.ssrn.com\"/>\n\nSegregation for the first time became a standard legal process in the South; it was informal in Northern cities. Jim Crow limited black access to transportation, schools, restaurants and other public facilities. Most southern blacks for decades continued to struggle in grinding poverty as agricultural, domestic and menial laborers. Many became [[sharecropper]]s, sharing the crop with the white land owners..\n\n===Racial terrorism===\nIn 1865, the [[Ku Klux Klan]], a secret [[vigilante]] organization dedicated to destroying the Republican Party in the South, especially by terrorizing black leaders, was formed. Klansmen hid behind masks and robes to hide their identity while they carried out violence and property damage. The Klan used [[terrorism]], especially murder and threats of murder, arson and intimidation. The Klan's excesses led to the passage of legislation against it, and with Federal enforcement, it was destroyed by 1871.<ref>Allen W. Trelease, '' White Terror: The Ku Klux Klan Conspiracy and Southern Reconstruction'' (1995)</ref>\n\nThe anti-Republican and anti-freedmen sentiment only briefly went underground, as violence arose in other incidents, especially after Louisiana's disputed state election in 1872, which contributed to the [[Colfax massacre|Colfax]] and [[Coushatta massacre]]s in [[Louisiana]] in 1873 and 1874. Tensions and rumors were high in many parts of the South. When violence erupted, African Americans consistently were killed at a much higher rate than were European Americans. Historians of the 20th century have renamed events long called \"riots\" in southern history. The common stories featured whites heroically saving the community from marauding blacks. Upon examination of the evidence, historians have called numerous such events \"massacres\", as at Colfax, because of the disproportionate number of fatalities for blacks as opposed to whites. The mob violence there resulted in 40\u201350 blacks dead for each of the three whites killed.<ref name=\"ftp.rootsweb.com\">[http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/la/state/history/military/uncat/colfaxr.txt \"Military Report on Colfax Riot, 1875\", from the ''Congressional Record''], accessed 6 April 2008. A state historical marker erected in 1950 noted that 150 blacks died and three whites.</ref>\n\nWhile not as widely known as the Klan, the [[paramilitary organizations]] that arose in the South during the mid-1870s as the white Democrats mounted a stronger insurgency, were more directed and effective than the Klan in challenging Republican governments, suppressing the black vote and achieving political goals. Unlike the Klan, paramilitary members operated openly, often solicited newspaper coverage, and had distinct political goals: to turn Republicans out of office and suppress or dissuade black voting in order to regain power in 1876. Groups included the [[White League]], that started from white militias in Grant Parish, Louisiana, in 1874 and spread in the [[Deep South]]; the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], that started in [[Mississippi]] in 1875 but had chapters arise and was prominent in the 1876 election campaign in [[South Carolina]], as well as in [[North Carolina]]; and other White Line organizations such as rifle clubs.<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War'', New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2007, pp. 70\u201376.</ref>\n\nThe [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] era accompanied the most cruel wave of \"racial\" suppression that America has yet experienced.  Between 1890 and 1940, millions of African Americans were disenfranchised, killed, and brutalized. According to newspaper records kept at the [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]], about 5,000 men, women, and children were murdered in documented extrajudicial mob violence &mdash;called \"[[lynchings]].\"  The journalist [[Ida B. Wells]] estimated that lynchings not reported by the newspapers, plus similar executions under the veneer of \"[[due process]]\", may have amounted to about 20,000 killings.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nOf the tens of thousands of lynchers and onlookers during this period, it is reported that fewer than 50 whites were ever indicted for their crimes, and only four were sentenced. Because blacks were disenfranchised, they could not sit on juries or have any part in the political process, including local offices. Meanwhile, the lynchings were used as a weapon of terror to keep millions of African-Americans living in a constant state of anxiety and fear.<ref>For the story of the lynchings, see Philip Dray, ''At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America'' (New York: Random House, 2002).

Du Bois]] and 28 other prominent, African-American men met secretly at [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]]. There, they produced a manifesto calling for an end to racial discrimination, full civil liberties for African Americans and recognition of human brotherhood. The organization they established came to be called the [[Niagara Movement]]. After the notorious [[Springfield, Illinois]] race riot of 1908, a group of concerned Whites joined with the leadership of the Niagara Movement and formed the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) a year later, in 1909. Under the leadership of Du Bois, the NAACP mounted legal challenges to segregation and lobbied legislatures on behalf of black Americans.\n\nWhile the NAACP use the court system to promote equality, at the local level African Americans adopted a self-help strategy. They pooled their resources to create independent community and institutional lives for themselves. They established schools, churches, social welfare institutions, banks, [[African-American newspapers]] and small businesses to serve the needs of their communities.<ref>August Meier, \"Booker T.

Standards of beauty were different for whites and blacks, and the black community developed its own standards, with an emphasis on hair care. Beauticians could work out of their own homes, and did not need storefronts. As a result, black beauticians were numerous in the rural South, despite the absence of cities and towns. They pioneered the use of cosmetics, at a time when rural white women in the South avoided them. As Blain Roberts has shown, beauticians offered their clients a space to feel pampered and beautiful in the context of their own community because, \"Inside black beauty shops, rituals of beautification converged with rituals of socialization.\" Beauty contests emerged in the 1920s, and in the white community they were linked to agricultural county fairs. By contrast in the black community, beauty contests were developed out of the homecoming ceremonies at their high schools and colleges.<ref>Blain Roberts, ''Pageants, Parlors, and Pretty Women: Race and Beauty in the Twentieth-Century South'' (2014), quote p 96.

Still, many African Americans eagerly volunteered to join the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] cause following America's entry into the war. More than two million African American men rushed to register for the draft. By the time of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice with Germany]] in November 1918, over 350,000 African Americans had served with the American Expeditionary Force on the Western Front.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nMost African American units were relegated to support roles and did not see combat. Still, African Americans played a significant role in America's war effort. Four African American regiments were integrated into French units because the French suffered heavy losses and badly needed men after three years of a terrible war. One of the most distinguished units was the [[369th Infantry Regiment]], known as the \"Harlem Hellfighters\", which was on the front lines for six months, longer than any other American unit in the war. 171 members of the 369th were awarded the [[Legion of Merit]].\n\nFrom May 1918 to November 1918, the 371st and 372nd African American Regiments were integrated under the 157th Red Hand Division<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigations/602_redhandflag.html|title=Red Hand Flag - History Detectives - PBS|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> commanded by the French General [[Mariano Goybet]].

Based on findings from this investigation, the Army Decorations Board approved the award of the Medal of Honor to Stowers.

Hundreds of thousands of African-Americans took the trains to Northern industrial centers in a dramatic historical event known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns in western Pennsylvania between 1890 and 1930 faced racial discrimination and limited economic opportunities. The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910.  Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities. <ref>Joe W.

They formed migration clubs, pooled their money, bought tickets at reduced rates, and often moved ingroups. Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.<ref>Trotter, \"Reflections on the Great Migration to Western Pennsylvania,\" p 154.</ref>\n\nAfter the war ended and the soldiers returned home, tensions were very high, with serious labor union strikes and inter-racial riots in major cities.

Roosevelt argued to Randolph that he could not antagonize the powerful bloc of conservative Southern Democrats in Congress, and desegregation of the military was out of the question as the Southern Democrats would never accept it; by contrast, as La Guardia pointed out, most of the factories in the defense industry were located in California, the Midwest and the Northeast.<ref name=\"Kennedy, David p. 767\"/>\n\n===Cotton===\nThe largest group of blacks worked in the cotton farms of the Deep South as sharecroppers or tenant farmers; a few owned their farms. Large numbers of whites also were tenant farmers and [[sharecroppers]]. [[Tenant farmer|Tenant farming]] characterized the cotton and tobacco production in the post-Civil War South. As the agricultural economy plummeted in the early 1930s, all farmers in all parts of the nation were badly hurt. Worst hurt were the tenant farmers (who had relatively more control) and sharecroppers (who had less control), as well as daily laborers (mostly black, with least control).<ref>Anthony J. Badger, ''The New Deal'' (1989), pp. 147\u201389.</ref>\n\nThe problem was very low prices for farm products and the New Deal solution was to raise them by cutting production. It accomplished this in the South by the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act|AAA]], which gave landowners acreage reduction contracts, by which they were paid to ''not'' grow cotton or tobacco on a portion of their land. By law, they were required to pay the tenant farmers and sharecroppers on their land a portion of the money, but some cheated on this provision, hurting their tenants and croppers. The farm wage workers who worked directly for the landowner were mostly the ones who lost their jobs. For most tenants and sharecroppers the AAA was a major help. Researchers at the time concluded, \"To the extent that the AAA control-program has been responsible for the increased price [of cotton], we conclude that it has increased the amount of goods and services consumed by the cotton tenants and croppers.\" Furthermore, the landowners typically let their tenants and croppers use the land taken out of production for their own personal use in growing food and feed crops, which further increased their standard of living. Another consequence was that the historic high levels of turnover from year to year declined sharply, as tenants and coppers tend to stay with the same landowner. Researchers concluded, \"As a rule, planters seem to prefer Negroes to whites as tenants and coppers.\"<ref>Fred C. Frey and T.

As a result, African-Americans left the South in large numbers to munitions centers in the North and West to take advantage of the shortages caused by the war, sparking the [[Second Great Migration]]. While they somewhat lived in better conditions than the South (for instance, they could vote and send children to better schools), they nevertheless faced widespread discrimination due to bigotry and fear of competition of housing and jobs among white residents.\n\nWhen Roosevelt learned that many companies in the defense industry were violating the spirit, if not the letter of Executive Order 8802 by only employing blacks in menial positions such as janitors and denying them the opportunity to work as highly paid skilled laborers, he significantly strengthened the [[Fair Employment Practice Committee]] (FEPC) with orders to fine the corporations that did not treat their black employees equally.<ref name=\"Kennedy, David p.775\">Kennedy, David ''Freedom from Fear'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005 p.775</ref> In 1943, Roosevelt gave the FEPC a budget of half-million dollars and replaced the unpaid volunteers who had previously staffed the FEPC with a paid staff concentrated in regional headquarters across the nation with instructions to inspect the defense industry's factories to ensure the spirit and letter of Executive Order 8802 was being obeyed.<ref name=\"Kennedy, David p.775\"/> Roosevelt believed that having black men and women employed in the defense industry working as skilled laborers would give them far higher wages than what they ever had before, and ultimately form the nucleus of a black middle class.<ref name=\"Kennedy, David p.775\"/> When the president learned that some unions were pushing for black employees to be given menial \"auxiliary\" jobs in the factories, he instructed the [[National Labor Relations Board]] to decertify those unions.<ref name=\"Kennedy, David p.775\"/> In 1944, when the union for trolley drivers in Philadelphia went on strike to protest plans to hire Afro-Americans as trolley drivers, Roosevelt sent in troops to break the strike.<ref name=\"Kennedy, David p.775\"/> In 1942, blacks made up 3% of the workforce in the defense industry; by 1945 blacks made up 8% of the workforce in defense industry factories (blacks made up 10% of the population).<ref name=\"Kennedy, David p.775\"/>       \n  \nRacial tensions were also high between whites and ethnic minorities that cities like [[Chicago]], [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)|Detroit]], [[Zoot Suit Riots|Los Angeles]], and [[Harlem Riot of 1943|Harlem]] experienced [[race riot]]s in 1943.<ref>Wynn, ''African American Experience During World War II'' (2011), pp. 25\u201342, 63\u201380.</ref> In May 1943, in Mobile, Alabama, when the local shipyard promoted some black men up to be trained as welders, white workers rioted and seriously injured 11 of their black co-workers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In Los Angeles, the Zoot Suit riots of 3\u20138 June 1943 saw white servicemen attacking ''Chicano'' (Mexican-American) and black youths for wearing [[zoot suits]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> On 15 June 1943, in Beaumont, Texas, a [[Beaumont race riot of 1943|pogrom]] saw a white mob smash up black homes while lynching 2 black men.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In Detroit, which expanded massively during the war years with 50, 000 blacks from the South and 200, 000 \"hillbilly\" whites from [[Appalachia]] moving to the city to work in the factories, competition for sparse rental housing had pushed tensions to the brink.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> On 20 June 1943, false rumors that a white mob had lynched 3 black men led to an outbreak of racial rioting in Detroit that left 34 dead, of whom 25 were black.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> On 1\u20132 August 1943, another [[Harlem riot of 1943|race riot]] in Harlem left 6 blacks dead.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nPolitically, blacks left the Republican Party and joined the Democratic [[New Deal Coalition]] of President [[Franklin D.

Some historians prefer to distinguish between the movements for those reasons.\n\nIn the Second Great Migration, more than five million African Americans moved to cities in states in the Northeast, Midwest, and West, including the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where many skilled jobs in the defense industry were concentrated. More of these migrants were already urban laborers who came from the cities of the South. They were better educated and had better skills than people who did not migrate.<ref name=\"AAME\"/>\n\nCompared to the more rural migrants of the period 1910\u201340, many African Americans in the South were already living in urban areas and had urban job skills before they relocated. They moved to take jobs in the burgeoning industrial cities and especially the many jobs in the defense industry during World War II. Workers who were limited to segregated, low-skilled jobs in Southern cities were able to get highly skilled, well-paid jobs at West Coast shipyards.<ref name=\"AAME\"/>  The effect of racially homogeneous communities composed largely of migrant blacks that formed because of spatial segregation in destination cities was that they were largely influenced by the Southern culture they brought with them. The food, music and even the discriminatory white police presence in these neighborhoods were all imported to a certain extent from the collective experiences of the highly concentrated African American migrants.<ref>Rutkoff, Peter M., and William B. Scott. ''Fly Away: The Great African American Cultural Migrations''. (Johns Hopkins UP, (2010)</ref>  Writers have often assumed that Southern migrants contributed disproportionately to changes in the African-American family in the inner city. However, census data  for 1940 through 1990 show that these families actually exhibited more traditional family patterns - more children living with two parents, more ever-married women living with their spouses, and fewer never-married mothers.<ref>Stewart E.

Fifty-three percent remained in the Southern United States, while 40 percent lived in the Northeast and North Central states and 7 percent in the West.<ref name=\"AAME\"/>\n\n==Civil Rights Movement==\n{{Main|Civil Rights Movement}}\nThe [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] handed down a landmark decision in the case of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) of [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]]. This decision applied to public facilities, especially public schools. Reforms  occurred slowly and only after concerted activism by African Americans. The ruling also brought new momentum to the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. [[Boycott]]s against segregated public transportation systems sprang up in the South, the most notable of which was the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]].\n\nCivil rights groups such as the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) organized across the South with tactics such as boycotts, voter registration campaigns, [[Freedom Rides]] and other nonviolent direct action, such as marches, pickets and sit-ins to mobilize around issues of equal access and voting rights. Southern segregationists fought back to block reform. The conflict grew to involve steadily escalating physical violence, bombings and intimidation by Southern whites. Law enforcement responded to protesters with batons, electric cattle prods, fire hoses, attack dogs and mass arrests.\n\nIn [[Virginia]], state legislators, school board members and other public officials mounted a campaign of obstructionism and outright defiance to integration called [[Massive Resistance]]. It entailed a series of actions to deny state funding to integrated schools and instead fund privately run \"segregation academies\" for white students. [[Farmville, Virginia]], in [[Prince Edward County, Virginia|Prince Edward County]], was one of the plaintiff African-American communities involved in the 1954 ''Brown v. Board of Education'' Supreme Court decision. As a last-ditch effort to avoid court-ordered desegregation, officials in the county shut down the county's entire public school system in 1959 and it remained closed for five years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercyseatfilms.com/filmcredits.html|title=Mercy Seat Films - 'THEY CLOSED OUR SCHOOLS' - Film Credits|website=Mercyseatfilms.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}</ref> White students were able to attend private schools established by the community for the sole purpose of circumventing integration. The largely black rural population of the county had little recourse.  Some families were split up as parents sent their children to live with relatives in other locales to attend public school; but the majority of Prince Edward's more than 2,000 black children, as well as many poor whites, simply remained unschooled until federal court action forced the schools to reopen five years later.\n\n[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|left|Dr. [[Martin Luther King]], Jr. delivers his famous \"[[I have a dream|I Have a Dream]]\" speech during the March on Washington]]\nPerhaps the high point of the Civil Rights Movement was the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], which brought more than 250,000 marchers to the grounds of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] and the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], to speak out for an end to southern racial violence and police brutality, equal opportunity in employment, equal access in education and public accommodations. The organizers of the march were called the \"[[Big Six (activists)|Big Six]]\" of the Civil Rights Movement: [[Bayard Rustin]] the strategist who has been called the \"invisible man\" of the Civil Rights Movement; labor organizer and initiator of the march, A. Phillip Randolph; [[Roy Wilkins]] of the NAACP; [[Whitney Young|Whitney Young, Jr.]], of the [[National Urban League]]; [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC); [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|James Farmer]] of the [[Congress on Racial Equality]] (CORE); and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). Also active behind the scenes and sharing the podium with Dr. King was [[Dorothy Height]], head of the [[National Council of Negro Women]]. It was at this event, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, that King delivered his historic \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech.\n\nThis march, the 1963 [[Birmingham campaign|Birmingham Children's Crusade]], and other events were credited with putting pressure on President [[John F. Kennedy]], and then [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], that culminated in the passage the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] that banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and labor unions.\n\n[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Civil Rights Act, July 2, 1964.jpg|thumb|250px|right|President Johnson signs the historic [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].]]\nThe \"Mississippi Freedom Summer\" of 1964 brought thousands of idealistic youth, black and white, to the state to run \"freedom schools\", to teach basic literacy, history and civics. Other volunteers were involved in voter registration drives. The season was marked by harassment, intimidation and violence directed at civil rights workers and their host families. The disappearance of three youths, [[James Chaney]], [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]] and [[Michael Schwerner]] in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], captured the attention of the nation. Six weeks later, searchers found the savagely beaten body of Chaney, a black man, in a muddy dam alongside the remains of his two white companions, who had been shot to death. There was national outrage at the escalating injustices of the \"Mississippi Blood Summer\", as it by then had come to be known, and at the brutality of the murders.\n\nIn 1965 the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma Voting Rights Movement]], its [[Selma to Montgomery marches]], and the tragic murders of two activists associated with the march, inspired President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] to call for the full [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which struck down barriers to black enfranchisement. In 1966 the [[Chicago Open Housing Movement]], followed by the passage of the [[1968 Civil Rights Act|1968 Fair Housing Act]], was a capstone to more than a decade of major legislation during the civil rights movement.\n\nBy this time, African Americans who questioned the effectiveness of nonviolent protest had gained a greater voice. More militant black leaders, such as [[Malcolm X]] of the [[Nation of Islam]] and [[Eldridge Cleaver]] of the [[Black Panther Party]], called for blacks to defend themselves, using violence, if necessary. From the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, the [[Black Power]] movement urged African Americans to look to Africa for inspiration and emphasized black solidarity, rather than integration.\n\n==Post Civil Rights era of African-American history==\n{{Main|Post-Civil Rights era in African-American history}}\n[[File:Official portrait of Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|right|The first [[African-American]] [[President of the United States]], [[Barack Obama]]]]\nPolitically and economically, blacks have made substantial strides in the post-civil rights era. Civil rights leader [[Jesse Jackson]], who ran for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988, brought unprecedented support and leverage to blacks in politics.\n\nIn 1989, [[Douglas Wilder]] became the first African-American elected governor in U.S. history. In 1992 [[Carol Moseley-Braun]] of [[Illinois]] became the first black woman elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. There were 8,936 black officeholders in the United States in 2000, showing a net increase of 7,467 since 1970. In 2001 there were 484 black mayors.\n\nThe 39 African-American members of Congress form the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], which serves as a political bloc for issues relating to African Americans. The appointment of blacks to high federal offices\u2014including General [[Colin Powell]], Chairman of the U.S. Armed Forces Joint Chiefs of Staff, 1989\u201393, [[United States Secretary of State]], 2001\u201305; [[Condoleezza Rice]], Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, 2001\u201304, Secretary of State in, 2005\u201309; [[Ron Brown (U.S. politician)|Ron Brown]], [[United States Secretary of Commerce]], 1993\u201396; and Supreme Court justices [[Thurgood Marshall]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]\u2014also demonstrates the increasing visibility of blacks in the political arena.\n\nEconomic progress for blacks' reaching the extremes of wealth has been slow. According to Forbes richest lists, [[Oprah Winfrey]] was the richest African American of the 20th century and has been the world's only [[black billionaires|black billionaire]] in 2004, 2005, and 2006.<ref>Roy Douglas Malonson, [http://www.aframnews.com/html/2006-05-10/publisher.htm \"Condi and Oprah aren\u2019t good role models for Black motherhood\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520021215/http://www.aframnews.com/html/2006-05-10/publisher.htm |date=2006-05-20 }}. ''African-American News&Issues: Publisher's Analysis''. Retrieved 19 September 2013</ref> Not only was Winfrey the world's only black billionaire but she has been the only black on the [[Forbes 400]] list nearly every year since 1995. [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] founder [[Robert L. Johnson|Bob Johnson]]  briefly joined her on the list from 2001 to 2003 before his ex-wife acquired part of his fortune; although he returned to the list in 2006, he did not make it in 2007. With Winfrey the only African American wealthy enough to rank among America's 400 richest people,<ref>[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070920/apfn_forbes_400_alphabetical_list.html]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> blacks currently comprise 0.25% of America's economic elite and comprise 13% of the U.S. population.\n\nThe dramatic political breakthrough came in the 2008 election, with the election of [[Barack Obama]], the son of a black Kenyan father and a white American mother. He won overwhelming support from African-American voters in the Democratic primaries, even as his main opponent Hillary Clinton had the support of many black politicians. African Americans continued to support Obama throughout his term.<ref>Shayla C. Nunnally, \"African American Perspectives on the Obama Presidency,\" in William Crotty, ed. ''The Obama Presidency: Promise and Performance'' (2012), pp. 127\u201350.</ref> After completing his first term, Obama ran for a second term. In 2012, he won the presidential election against candidate [[Mitt Romney]] and was re-elected as the president of the United States.\n\nThe post-civil rights era is also notable for the [[New Great Migration]], in which millions of African Americans have returned to the South including [[Texas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]] and [[North Carolina]], often to pursue increased economic opportunities in now-desegregated southern cities.\n\n===Social issues===\nAfter the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gains of the 1950s\u20131970s, due to government neglect, unfavorable social policies, high [[poverty in the United States|poverty rates]], changes implemented in the [[criminal justice]] system and laws, and a breakdown in traditional family units, African-American communities have been suffering from extremely high [[incarceration in the United States|incarceration rates]].

During [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]] and the late 19th century, blacks became major actors in the South. The [[Dunning School]] of white scholars generally cast the blacks as pawns of white Carpetbaggers during this period, but [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], a black historian, and [[Ulrich B. Phillips]], a white historian, studied the African-American experience in depth. Du Bois' study of Reconstruction provided a more objective context for evaluating its achievements and weaknesses; in addition, he did studies of contemporary black life. Phillips set the main topics of inquiry that still guide the analysis of slave economics.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, [[Carter G. Woodson]] was the major black scholar studying and promoting the black historical experience. Woodson insisted that the study of African descendants be scholarly sound, creative, restorative, and, most important, directly relevant to the black community. He popularized black history with a variety of innovative strategies, including Association for the Study of Negro Life outreach activities, Negro History Week (now [[Black History Month]], in February), and a popular black history magazine. Woodson democratized, legitimized, and popularized black history.<ref>Pero Gaglo Dagbovie, \"Making Black History Practical and Popular: Carter G. Woodson, the Proto Black Studies Movement, and the Struggle for Black Liberation.\" ''Western Journal of Black Studies'' 2004 28(2): 372\u2013383. {{ISSN|0197-4327}} Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]</ref>\n\n[[Benjamin Quarles]] (1904\u201396) had a significant impact on the teaching of African-American history. Quarles and [[John Hope Franklin]] provided a bridge between the work of historians in [[historically black colleges]], such as Woodson, and the black history that is now well established in mainline universities. Quarles grew up in Boston, attended [[Shaw University]] as an undergraduate, and received a graduate degree at the [[University of Wisconsin]]. He began in 1953 teaching at [[Morgan State College]] in Baltimore, where he stayed, despite a lucrative offer from [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Quarles' books included ''The Negro in the American Revolution'' (1961), ''Black Abolitionists'' (1969), ''The Negro in the Civil War'' (1953), and ''Lincoln and the Negro'' (1962), which were narrative accounts of critical wartime episodes that focused on how blacks interacted with their white allies.<ref>Meier, August, \"Benjamin Quarles and the Historiography of Black America,\" ''Civil War History,'' June 1980, Vol. 26, No. 2, pp. 101\u2013116.</ref>\n\nBlack history attempted to reverse centuries of ignorance. While black historians were not alone in advocating a new examination of slavery and racism in the United States, the study of African-American history has often been a political and scholarly struggle to change assumptions. One of the foremost assumptions was that slaves were passive and did not rebel. A series of historians transformed the image of African Americans, revealing a much richer and complex experience. Historians such as [[Leon F. Litwack]] showed how former slaves fought to keep their families together and struggled against tremendous odds to define themselves as free people. Others wrote of rebellions small and large.\n\nIn the 21st century, black history is regarded as mainstream.  Since proclamation by President [[Jimmy Carter]], it is celebrated every February in the United States during \"Black History Month.\" Proponents of black history believe that it promotes diversity, develops self-esteem, and corrects myths and stereotypes. Opponents argue such curricula are dishonest, divisive, and lack academic credibility and rigor.<ref>Abul Pitre and Ruth Ray, \"The Controversy Around Black History,\" ''Western Journal of Black Studies'' 2002 26(3): 149\u2013154. {{ISSN|0197-4327}} Fulltext: Ebsco.</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of black history===\nSurveys of 11th and 12th-grade students and adults in 2005 show that American schools have given students an awareness of some famous figures in black history.  Both groups were asked to name 10 famous Americans, excluding presidents. Of those named, the three most mentioned were black: 67% named Martin Luther King, 60% Rosa Parks, and 44% Harriet Tubman. Among adults, King was second (at 36%) and Parks was tied for fourth with 30%, while Tubman tied for 10th place with Henry Ford, at 16%. When distinguished historians were asked in 2006 to name the most prominent Americans, Parks and Tubman did not make the top 100.<ref>Sam Wineburg and Chauncey Monte-Sano, \"'Famous Americans': The Changing Pantheon of American Heroes,\" ''Journal of American History'' (March 2008), 94#4, pp. 1186\u20131202.</ref>\n\n===Scholars of African-American history===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n* [[Herbert Aptheker]]\n* [[Lerone Bennett, Jr.]]\n* [[Ira Berlin]]\n* [[John Wesley Blassingame]]\n* [[John Henrik Clarke]]\n* [[W.

Owned by [[John Catsimatidis]]' Red Apple Media, the station currently serves as the [[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] for [[Broadcast syndication#Radio syndication|syndicated]] hosts [[Mark Levin]] and [[John Batchelor]]; it is the radio home for [[Bernard McGuirk]], [[Sid Rosenberg]], [[Curtis Sliwa]] and [[Juliet Huddy]]; and is the New York City affiliate for [[Westwood One News]], [[Brian Kilmeade]], ''[[The Ben Shapiro Show]]'' and ''[[Red Eye Radio]]''. The station shares studio facilities with former sister station [[WNBM]] above [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]], and its transmitter is located in [[Lodi, New Jersey]]. Its 50,000 watt non-directional [[Clear-channel station|clear channel]] signal can be heard at night throughout much of the eastern United States and Canada, and it is the primary entry point for the [[Emergency Alert System]] in the [[New York metropolitan area]]. \n\nOne of the country's oldest radio stations, WABC began broadcasting in early October 1921, originally as WJZ in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. For much of its history, the station had served as the flagship for [[Cumulus Media Networks|the original ABC Radio Network]] (and their direct predecessor, the [[Blue Network]]) and ABC's [[ABC News Radio|radio news service]]. While WABC has programmed a talk radio [[radio format|format]] since 1982, the station broadcast a [[Top 40]] music format from 1960 to 1981. Prior to 1978, WABC was not only the dominant contemporary music station in [[New York City]], but was also among the most listened to radio stations in North America, serving as a template for many other Top 40 stations around the country.\n\n==History==\n===WJZ Newark (1921-1923)===\n[[File:1922 WJZ Newark radio studio.JPEG|thumb|325px|Original WJZ Newark studio.

This initial station proved successful, so the next year the company developed plans to set up additional stations in major population centers, including, in addition to the New York City area, [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]], originally in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], and [[KYW (AM)|KYW]], originally in [[Chicago, Illinois]].\n\nOn September 30, 1921, Westinghouse was issued a broadcasting authorization for a station with the randomly assigned call letters WJZ,<ref>It has been speculated that the call letters might have signified New '''J'''er('''Z''')sey; however, this appears to be a case of [[folk etymology]], as there are no contemporary references to support this.</ref> located at the company's meter factory at Orange and Plane streets in [[Newark, New Jersey]], and transmitting on a wavelength of 360 meters (833&nbsp;kHz).<ref>Limited Commercial license, serial #230, issued September 30, 1921, for a one-year term. The station had previously been issued a license in May 1921, but was not used for broadcasting at that time.</ref>\n\nWJZ's studio and transmitter were initially housed in a shack located on the factory roof that was only accessible by ladder. The station later expanded to a larger studio on the factory's ground floor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barnouw|first=Erik|title=A Tower in Babel: A History of Broadcasting in the United States Volume 1 - to 1933|year=1966|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0195004744|page=87}}</ref> The station began test transmissions around October 1, 1921, followed, beginning October 5, by broadcasts of the [[1921 World Series]] baseball games.

A popular early feature was the \"Man in the Moon\" bedtime stories, written by [[Josephine Lawrence]] and read over the air by Bill McNeary (both were ''Newark Sunday Call'' employees). Beginning on November 27, 1921, a weekly 90-minute show presented by the [[Vincent Lopez]] band was aired.<ref>Pat Browne,''The guide to United States popular culture''. Popular Press, 2001, p.611. {{ISBN|0-87972-821-3}}</ref>\n\nWhen it began its broadcast service, WJZ was the only station in the [[Tri-State Region|New York City area]] transmitting on 360 meters. In mid-December 1921 station [[WDY]], operated by the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) from Roselle Park, New Jersey, began sharing the wavelength, with WJZ now broadcasting on Sundays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays and WDY operating on the other three nights. This soon ended when WDY ceased operations in mid-February 1922 and was merged with WJZ, with RCA now assuming half of WJZ's expenses. However, within a few months a large number of additional broadcasting stations began operating on 360 meters, and WJZ was stubborn about having to share \"its\" wavelength. In May 1922 a proposed time-sharing agreement among 15 local stations assigned more than half of the available airtime to WJZ, but the station did not feel this was sufficient, which in turn led the Radio Broadcasting Society of America to petition that WJZ's license be canceled for being uncooperative.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015013717361&view=1up&seq=471 \"War Between Broadcasting Stations\"], ''Radio Broadcast'', October 1922, pages 457-458.</ref>\n\n[[File:1922 Man in the Moon bedtime story poster.JPEG|thumb|250px|The nightly \"Man in the Moon\" bedtime stories were a popular early feature.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/radiodealer02unse#page/n89/mode/2up|title=Advertisement for Clark and Tilson Company|work=The Radio Dealer|issue=Vol. 2 No. 1|date=October 1922|pages=84\u201385|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}</ref>]]\nThere were no formal standards in the United States defining broadcasting stations until December 1, 1921, when the Department of Commerce\u2014which regulated radio at this time-issued a regulation specifying that stations making broadcasts intended for the general public now had to hold a Limited Commercial license that authorized operation on 360 or 485 meters.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435066705633&view=1up&seq=200|title=Amendments to Regulations|work=[[Bureau of Navigation]] [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] Radio Service Bulletin|page=10|date=January 3, 1922|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}</ref> WJZ was one of a small number of stations that already met this standard at the time of its adoption. It was also the second oldest of the two licenses previously issued for the state of New Jersey, preceded by RCA's WDY grant. However, WJZ was the first to go on the air, as WDY didn't begin operations until two and a half months after WJZ's debut.\n\nWJZ had difficulty convincing New York City performers \u2013 who were not paid \u2013 to make the trek to Newark, so on February 5, 1922 a more convenient remote studio was opened at the [[Waldorf\u2013Astoria (New York, 1893)|Waldorf-Astoria]], located on Fifth Avenue and Thirty-Fourth Street.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112061168321&view=1up&seq=258 \"WJZ Opens New Studio\"], ''National Electragist (Radio Service Supplement)'', March 1923, page 4.</ref> The [[AT&T Corporation|American Telephone & Telegraph Company]] (AT&T) was unwilling to provide a telephone line to connect the Waldorf-Astoria studio to the Newark transmitter, so the link was instead made using specially prepared telegraph wires provided by [[Western Union]]. However, this expedient only provided marginal audio quality, and \"the line was so noisy that when Newcomb Carleton, the president of Western Union, broadcast over it, his voice was completely drowned out\".<ref>''Sarnoff: An American Success'' by [[Carl Dreher]], 1977, page 73.</ref>\n\nOn March 15, 1922, WJZ broadcast a studio performance of [[The Impresario|Mozart's Impresario]], probably the first full-length opera broadcast in the New York City area. In October 1922, the station aired its second [[1922 World Series|World Series]], this time also feeding it to [[WGY (AM)|WGY]] in [[Schenectady, New York]]. Shortly after midnight on December 9, 1922, WJZ became the first broadcasting station confirmed to have been heard in Europe, consisting of a short program featuring greetings from the British consul in New York to British listeners and [[Oliver Twist (Vaughn De Leath song)|Vaughn De Leath singing her \"Oliver Twist\" song]].\n\n===WJZ New York City (1923-1953)===\n====Takeover by RCA====\nMay 15, 1923 saw a number of simultaneous major changes. Most notably, on this day the station moved from Newark to New York City, and the ownership was changed from joint Westinghouse-RCA responsibility to full control by RCA. WJZ now occupied studios on the sixth floor of the building where the [[Aeolian Hall (New York)|Aeolian Hall]] was located, and station publicity heralded the upgrade: \"Located in the heart of the city's musical and theatrical district, where entertainment of the highest order is ever available, this station will offer to the American public the most elaborate radio programs yet attempted and with a degree of faithfulness in reproduction that marks the beginning of a new era in radio broadcasting.\"<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112061168321&view=1up&seq=340 \"New York's Super Station\"], ''National Electragist'', June 1923, pages 44, 46.</ref> This was also the day that the Department of Commerce implemented an expansion of the broadcast band, which now consisted of a range of transmitting frequencies from 550 to 1350, with WJZ assigned the sole use of 660. Finally, a sister station with the call letters of [[WJY (New York City)|WJY]] operating on 740, was established, which shared the \"Broadcast Central\" Aeolian Hall studios, with WJZ providing more serious programming, and WJY's offerings considered more informal.\n\nProgram logs from May 15 to December 31, 1923, show WJZ aired 3426 programs, including 723 talks, 67 church services, 205 bedtime stories and 21 sports events. Many of the broadcasts were musical and ranged from [[Carnegie Hall]] and Aeolian Hall recitals to harmonica and banjo solos.\n\nAs part of the move to Aeolian Hall, WJZ's transmitting antenna was constructed atop the building, but the location in the middle of New York City proved to be a poor choice. At the end of 1925, the station began operations from a new transmitter site located at [[Bound Brook, New Jersey]]. However, this overwhelmed several other stations on the air, forcing WJZ engineers to visit homes in central New Jersey to deal with the complaints.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} As a result, WJZ didn't operate regularly at 50,000 watts until 1935.\n\n====Initial network operations====\nWestinghouse and RCA's original financing plan envisioned that profits from receiver sales would provide the funds for broadcast station operations, but this revenue soon became insufficient. In 1922, AT&T adopted a more practical approach, of selling airtime, which it called \"toll broadcasting\", in addition to connecting stations together using telephone lines to form a radio network that could broadcast programs simultaneously to multiple sites. This first radio network was called the \"WEAF chain\", named after the flagship AT&T station (later [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]]; now [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN]]), located in New York City.\n\nRCA, along with its \"radio group\" allies of Westinghouse and General Electric, responded by creating a small network of their own, centered on WJZ. Due to AT&T's interpretation of a patent-rights cross-licensing agreement, the telephone company claimed the sole right to sell airtime, so WJZ was not able to charge for advertising, and again there were technical limitations, since the network had to use inferior telegraph lines to interconnect its stations.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/radiobroadcast09gardrich#page/n316/mode/1up|title=How Much It Costs to Broadcast|work=Radio Broadcast|issue=Vol. IX No. 5|last=Lescarboura|first=Austin C.|date=September 1926|pages=367\u2013371|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====NBC-Blue network flagship years====\n[[File:Dennis King 1934.JPG|thumb|180px|Actor and vocalist [[Dennis King]] had a weekly network radio program on WJZ in 1934.]]\nIn the summer of 1926, AT&T decided to withdraw from the broadcasting field, and sold its stations and network operations to RCA. Included with this sale was the right to sell advertising time, and access to telephone lines for radio network connections.\n\nThe earlier network operations were reorganized as the [[National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC), with the primary network, now known as the [[NBC Red Network]], originating from WEAF. A second network, known as the [[NBC Blue Network]], with WJZ as the originating station, debuted on January 1, 1927. (The WJY sister station was quietly discontinued at this time.) In October 1927, WJZ moved into NBC studios still under construction at 711 Fifth Avenue. A month later, WEAF joined WJZ, and both were together under one roof. On November 11, 1928, as part of a general station reassignment produced by the [[Federal Radio Commission]]'s [[General Order 40]], WJZ moved to 760&nbsp;kHz.\n\nOn March 24, 1932, WJZ became the first radio station to broadcast a program from aboard a moving train; the station aired a variety show produced aboard a [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] passenger train travelling through Maryland.<ref>Rivanna Chapter National Railway Historical Society, ''[http://avenue.org/nrhs/histmar.htm This Month in Railroad History: March]''.  Retrieved March 24, 2006.</ref> In November 1933, WJZ, WEAF plus the NBC and RCA corporate headquarters moved to [[Rockefeller Center|30 Rockefeller Plaza]].\n\nIn 1941, under the provisions of the [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement]], stations assigned to 760&nbsp;kHz were shifted to 770&nbsp;kHz, which has been WJZ/WABC's dial position ever since.\n\nWJZ and the Blue Network presented many of America's most popular programs, such as ''[[Lowell Thomas|Lowell Thomas and the News]]'', ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'', ''[[America's Town Meeting of the Air]]'', and ''[[Death Valley Days]]''. Each midday, ''[[The National Farm and Home Hour]]'' brought news and entertainment to rural listeners. [[Ted Malone]] read poetry and [[Milton Cross]] conveyed children \"Coast To Coast on a Bus\", as well as bringing opera lovers the Saturday matin\u00e9e [[Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts]]. Cross would continue to host the Met on NBC, ABC, CBS and NPR until his passing at the beginning of 1975.\n\nOccasionally, a show would premiere on NBC Blue, which had a weaker lineup of stations nationwide, and be shifted to the Red Network if it grew in popularity. ''[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]'' is one example.\n\nWhen the FCC limited broadcast stations to 50&nbsp;kW, a 500&nbsp;kW transmitter built by RCA for WJZ was no longer allowed. The transmitter was sold by RCA to Britain and used for wartime [[Black Propaganda]]; broadcasting as ''[[Soldatensender Calais]]'' a purported German military station.\n\n===Birth of ABC===\nIn 1942, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) ruled that no broadcaster could own more than one AM, one FM and one television station in a single market. On January 23, 1942, the FCC approved the transfer of WJZ's operating license from Radio Corporation of America to the Blue Network, Inc.<ref>{{cite news|title=FCC Okays Transfer of WJZ, KGO, WENR|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DgwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=6|accessdate=30 October 2014|agency=Billboard|date=January 31, 1942}}</ref> A year later, on October 12, 1943, WJZ and the NBC Blue Network were sold to [[Edward J. Noble]], then the owner of [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]]. Technically, this spun off network was simply called \"The Blue Network\" for little over a year.\n\nOn June 15, 1945, \"The Blue Network\" was officially rechristened the [[American Broadcasting Company]], when negotiations were completed with [[Storer Broadcasting|George B. Storer]], who had owned the defunct American Broadcasting System and still owned the name. In November 1948, WJZ and the ABC network finally got a home of their own when studios were moved to a renovated building at 7 West 66th Street.\n\n[[File:WJZ now WABC advertisement (1953).jpg|thumb|1953 advertisement announcing the call letter change from WJZ to WABC.<ref name=\"callchange\">{{cite magazine|title=WABC and WABC-TV ad|url=https://archive.org/stream/broadcastingtele44unse#page/n904/mode/1up|accessdate=March 14, 2018|work=Broadcasting Telecasting|issue=Vol. 44, No. 9|date=March 2, 1953|page=37}}</ref>]]\nOn March 1, 1953, WJZ changed its call letters to WABC, after the FCC approved ABC's merger with [[United Paramount Theatres]], the movie theater chain owned by [[Paramount Pictures]] which, like the Blue Network, was divested under government order.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Ambitious ABC Planning Initiated Under New Merged Ownership|url=https://archive.org/stream/broadcastingtele44unse#page/n658/mode/1up|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=Broadcasting Telecasting|issue=Vol. 44, No. 7|date=February 16, 1953|pages=27\u201329}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=It's now WABC-AM-FM-TV; ABC also changes slides|url=https://archive.org/stream/broadcastingtele44unse#page/n937/mode/1up|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=Broadcasting Telecasting|issue=Vol. 44, No. 9|date=March 2, 1953|page=70}}</ref><ref name=\"callchange\" /> The WABC call letters were previously used on [[CBS Radio]]'s New York City AM and FM outlets (having taken the callsign as a reflection of original owner Atlantic Broadcasting Company), before adopting their current [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] and [[WCBS-FM]] identities in November 1946 and September 1947, respectively.\n\nIn 1957, several years after WJZ's callsign change to WABC, Westinghouse Broadcasting acquired WAAM-TV in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and applied to change the calls to [[WJZ-TV]], in honor of its former pioneer radio station.<ref>{{cite web|title=WBC's WAAM (TV) buy: $4.4 million. |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/57-OCR/1957-05-13-BC-OCR-Page-0098.pdf |periodical=Broadcasting - Telecasting |page=112 |date=May 13, 1957}}</ref> The FCC waived existing rules and granted this request to restore a three-letter callsign years after being retired on an unrelated station in a different market, albeit with a \"-TV\" suffix (perhaps because Westinghouse was highly regarded as a licensee by both the industry and the FCC at that time),<ref>{{cite web|title=WAAM (TV) becomes WJZ-TV as FCC waives call rule. |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/57-OCR/1957-08-05-BC-OCR-Page-0092.pdf |periodical=Broadcasting - Telecasting |page=92 |date=August 5, 1957}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Stations (continued, top of page). |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/57-OCR/1957-08-12-BC-OCR-Page-0094.pdf |periodical=Broadcasting - Telecasting |page=94 |date=August 12, 1957}}</ref> and the Baltimore TV station, now owned and operated by [[CBS]], retains the call letters to this day. CBS later applied the call sign to Baltimore-area radio stations [[WJZ (AM)]] and [[WJZ-FM]], which are now owned by [[Entercom]].\n\n===WABC's first era (1953-1960)===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\nAlthough WABC continued to air ABC programming during this time, ABC Radio \u2013 like the other major radio networks of that era \u2013 began to drop significant amounts of long-form comedy and dramatic programming, many of which migrated over to television. In response, WABC began using deejays playing recorded music in greater frequency. Some programs featured [[Middle of the road (music)|middle of the road music]], including Broadway and Hollywood showtunes and popular music, while other portions of the schedule included ABC Radio's remaining long-form newscasts and dramatic program lineup, in tandem with CBS Radio's WCBS and NBC Radio's [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]].\n\n(This would continue until 1960, as the Musicradio 77 era formally began, but WABC was still required to carry several of ABC Radio's non-music and entertainment shows, including the long-running ''[[Don McNeill (performer)|Don McNeill's]] [[Don McNeill's Breakfast Club|Breakfast Club]]'' during the 10:00&nbsp;am hour, and a long-form news block in the afternoon-drive period. While this was not an issue prior to 1960, such commitments created a programming clash with the Top 40 format up until the network was dissected into four sub-networks in 1968.)\n\nIn 1958\u20131959, legendary rock'n'roll disk jockey [[Alan Freed]] hosted a daily evening show on WABC, which was similar in format and musical policy to the early rock shows he had gained fame with on [[WKNR|WJW]] in Cleveland, and later [[WINS (AM)#Rock and roll|WINS]] in New York. Freed's time at WABC ended when he was caught up in the investigation of the \"[[payola]]\" scandals of the era.\n\nAt different times in the pre-top-40 era, famed comedian [[Ernie Kovacs]] and dean of early disc jockeys [[Martin Block]] were heard on the station.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.erniekovacs.net/images/radio.jpg|title=Mayhem in the A.M.; WABC ad for The Ernie Kovacs Show|date=May 30, 1955|magazine=Broadcasting|accessdate=January 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928150426/http://www.erniekovacs.net/images/radio.jpg#|archive-date=September 28, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tLs_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=lVcMAAAAIBAJ&pg=994,218743&dq=martin+block&hl=en|title=Disk Jockey, ABC Sign Big Contract|date=March 17, 1953|publisher=Youngstown Vindicator|accessdate=January 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===The Musicradio 77 era (1960-1982)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\n\n====Early years====\nWhen Harold L. Neal, Jr. was named General Manager of WABC, he was charged with making WABC successful in terms of both audience and profits. Neal had been at [[WXYT (AM)|WXYZ]] in Detroit. By 1960, WABC was committed to a nearly full-time schedule of [[top-40]] songs played by upbeat personalities. Still, WABC played popular non-rock and roll songs as well, provided they scored well on the Top 40 charts. WABC's early days as a [[Top 40]] station were humble ones.\n\n[[WINS (AM)|WINS]] was the No. 1 hit music station and [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]], which did a similar rock leaning top 40 format, was also a formidable competitor, while WABC barely ranked in the Top Ten. Fortunately for WABC, the other Top 40 outlets could not be heard as well in more distant New York and [[New Jersey]] suburbs, since WINS, [[WEPN (AM)|WMGM]], and WMCA were all directional stations. WABC, with its 50,000-watt non-directional signal, had the advantage of being heard in places west, south, and northwest of New York City, a huge chunk of the growing suburban population and this is where the station began to draw ratings. Early in 1962, WMGM, owned by Loew's, which then owned [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], was sold to [[Storer Broadcasting]]. Upon its sale, WMGM reverted to its original [[WEPN (AM)#WHN|WHN]] call letters and switched to a middle of the road music format playing mostly non-rock artists such as [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Andy Williams]].\n\nSam Holman was the first WABC program director of this era. Under Holman, WABC achieved No. 1 ratings during much of 1962, after WMGM reverted to WHN. By the summer of 1963, WMCA led the pack among contemporary stations, with WABC at No. 2 and WINS slipping to third place. It has been said, but is difficult to verify, that WMCA dominated in the city proper, while WABC owned the suburbs. This would be consistent with WMCA's 5,000-watt directional signal.\n\n====Dominant years====\nHal Neal hired [[Rick Sklar]] as WABC's program director. He would go on to become a member of the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]] and be credited as one of the pioneering architects of the Top 40 format. Under Sklar, the station went to the shortest playlist of any contemporary music station in history. The number one song was heard about every hour during the day and every 75 minutes or so at night. The other top 5 songs were heard nearly as often. Other current songs averaged once to twice per airshift. The station played about 9 current hits per hour and several non-current songs. The non-currents were no more than 5 years old and the station played about 70 of them in total. In his book ''Rockin' America'', Sklar said he was sensitive to [[payola]] concerns and advanced airplay. Through the years, WABC was known by various slogans, \"Channel 77 WABC\" and later \"Musicradio 77 WABC\". Due to the high number of commercials each hour, WABC played no more than two songs in a row and there was frequent DJ talk and personality between every song. The station averaged 6 commercial breaks per hour but they were no more than 3 ads in a row. Often the air personalities delivered live commercials in their own humorous style, so that listeners would consider the spot part of the entertainment.\n\nEarly 1960s disc jockeys included [[Dan Ingram]], Herb Oscar Anderson, Charlie Greer, [[Scott Muni]], Chuck Dunaway, Jack Carney and Bob \"Bobaloo\" Lewis. But some of the best known WABC DJs are the ones that followed them in the mid-1960s and 1970s: [[Harry Harrison (DJ)|Harry Harrison]], [[Ron Lundy]], [[Bruce Morrow|\"Cousin Brucie\"]], [[Chuck Leonard]] (one of the earliest African-American DJs to be on the staff of a major mainstream radio station), [[Johnny Donovan]], Bob Cruz (a Dan Ingram sound alike), [[Frank Kingston Smith]], [[Roby Yonge]], [[George Michael (sportscaster)|George Michael]], Jim Nettleton, [[Jim Perry (television personality)|Jim Perry]] and Steve O'Brien. Meanwhile, \"Radio Hall of Fame\" member Dan Ingram, perhaps WABC's best known DJ, was held over from the early staff, being heard in the afternoon for much of WABC's Top 40 history. Noted sportscaster [[Howard Cosell]] did a brief weekday evening sportscast on WABC, as well as hosting a late Sunday night interview show called \"Speaking of Everything.\"\n\nEspecially in the afternoons and evenings, WABC was the station that [[Adolescence|teenagers]] could be heard listening to on [[transistor radio]]s all over the [[New York metropolitan area]]. Due to its strong signal, the station could be heard easily over 100 miles away, including the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskill]] and [[Pocono Mountains]], and through much of [[Connecticut]] and [[Rhode Island]]. After sunset, when AM radio waves travel farther, WABC's signal could be picked up around much of the Eastern U.S. and Canada. Bruce Morrow often spoke about how he felt an almost psychic bond to his young listeners.\n\nA famous tape, or [[aircheck]], of WABC from August 1964 features some of the DJs speaking from a window of [[the Beatles]]' hotel room at the [[Drumpf Park Avenue|Hotel Delmonico]] during their second visit to New York City, while Dan Ingram, back in the studio, played WABC [[jingle]]s to thousands of teenagers in the streets below, who enthusiastically sang along with them. Ingram later noted that this was actually illegal under FCC rules, but said that they didn't know it at the time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musicradio WABC Beatles Page|url=http://www.musicradio77.com/beatles.html|work=Musicradio 77 WABC Information Page}}</ref> In the wake of the success of \"W-A-Beatle-C\" (as it was briefly called around the time of the Beatles' U.S. visit), competitor [[WINS (AM)|WINS]] finally dropped out of the Top 40 battle in 1965, adopting an all-news format. The ABC television network also called itself \"A-Beatles-C\" whenever it promoted airings of Beatles-related films.\n\nJust before the famous [[Northeast blackout of 1965]], Dan Ingram noted that the studio's electric power was fluctuating and he began having fun with the slowed-down music. After playing \"[[Everyone's Gone to the Moon]]\" by [[Jonathan King]], he quipped it was played \"in the key of R\". Ingram then proceeded to run some recorded commercials and a portion of [[Si Zentner]]'s \"Up a Lazy River\", backtimed to the news, while commenting on how everything seemed to be running slower than normal. During the 6&nbsp;pm newscast, WABC left the air as the outage settled in for real.<ref>[http://www.musicradio77.com/images/ing11-9-65blackout.mp3 1965 Blackout]</ref> Ingram later drove out to the transmitter site in Lodi, New Jersey, with a box of records, and continued his show from the backup studio housed there.\n\nIn the 1970s, WABC was either No. 1 or No. 2 consistently, often trading places with [[WOR (AM)|WOR]]. Once in a while, a station attracting an older audience (like [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] or [[WPAT (AM)|WPAT]]) would move into the top spot. These stations were not truly WABC's direct competitors because they targeted a much older audience. Chief competitor [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] began running evening talk by 1968 and stopped playing top 40 music altogether in the fall of 1970. Then in 1971, Country Music station WJRZ abruptly flipped to a Top 40 format and became known as [[WNYM|WWDJ]]. That lasted until April 1974. [[WEPN-FM|WOR-FM]] evolved from progressive rock to Adult Top 40 playing the hits of 1955 to current product by 1968. They dropped most pre-1964 oldies in 1972 and became known as WXLO 99X. That station evolved into more on an Adult Contemporary format in 1979 and a Rhythmic Top 40 format in 1980. Other [[Frequency modulation|FM]] competitors like oldies station [[WCBS-FM]], [[soul music|soul]] station [[WBLS]], and [[album-oriented rock]] stations like [[WPLJ]] and [[WNEW-FM]] all did well in the ratings, but none rivalled WABC's success. [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] competitor [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] also never came close to WABC's audience during this period. WNBC then had a format similar to 99X playing Adult Top 40. In 1977, WNBC tried sounding younger and moved their format musically closer to WABC. Then by 1979 they tried sounding older and somewhere in-between. Until 1978, WABC remained dominant.\n\nWABC's ratings strength came from its cumulative audience, what the radio industry calls \"cume\". Most listeners didn't stay with WABC for long periods of time, as the station had some of the shortest \"time spent listening\" (or TSL) spans in the history of music radio\u2014an average listener spent about 10 minutes listening to WABC. It was the price paid for a short playlist, and numerous commercials between songs (the large number of [[Radio advertisement|ads]] being due to WABC's large audience), but what WABC lacked in TSL it more than made up for with its sheer number of listeners. By 1975, WABC tried becoming more music-intensive, reducing commercial breaks to three per hour. It began playing 3 to 5 songs in a row, still mixed with talk and personality, but done in a tighter manner.\n\nFed up with the short playlist, Cousin Brucie left in August 1974 to defect to rival WNBC. Rick Sklar was promoted in 1976 to vice president of programming for [[Cumulus Media Networks|ABC Radio]], and his assistant program director Glenn Morgan became WABC's program director. The station's influence could be found in odd places: [[Philip Glass]]' 1976 opera, ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'', has as part of the background a recitation of WABC's DJ schedule in the 1960s.\n\n====\"Disco\" era====\nThe end of the 1970s found FM radio beginning to overtake AM music stations in most markets. In June 1975, an FM station on 92.3, owned by the San Juan (Puerto Rico) Racing Association flipped to Soft Rock and became known as Mellow 92 WKTU. That station had very low ratings and had no effect on WABC. But on July 24, 1978, at 6 PM, WKTU abruptly dropped its Soft Rock format in favor of a [[disco]]-based top 40 format known as \"Disco 92\". By December of that year, WABC was unseated, as WKTU became the No. 1 station in New York City. The first \"disco\" ratings saw WKTU with 11 percent of the listening audience\u2014a huge number anywhere, let alone in a market the size of New York City\u2014and WABC dropping from 4.1 million listeners to 3 million, losing 25 percent of its audience practically overnight.\n\nAfter this initial ratings tumble, WABC panicked and began mixing in several extended disco mixes per hour and sometimes played two back-to-back. Some of the disco songs ran in excess of eight minutes. What regular listeners heard was a major change in sound. While the station continued playing non-disco and rock songs about a third of the time, the station's familiar format had seemed to disappear and as a result, WABC began to lose its identity. In late spring 1979, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine reported that Rick Sklar had demoted program director Glenn Morgan to \"moving carts\" instead of making programming decisions. WABC's numbers dropped for four consecutive ratings periods.\n\nOn August 2, 1979, the [[Donna Summer]] disco hit \"[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]\" was playing during [[Dan Ingram]]'s afternoon drive program. During the song, DJ [[George Michael (sportscaster)|George Michael]] (who also was a sports reporter) interrupted to break the news that [[New York Yankees]] catcher and team captain [[Thurman Munson]] had died in a plane crash. In late summer, WABC moved, temporarily, back to their tight playlists.\n\nThat Fall, Al Brady took over as programming director of WABC. He had come from [[WHDH AM|WHDH]] [[Boston]], where he evolved that station from [[Middle of the road (music)|Middle of the Road]] to more of an [[Adult Contemporary]] format. At WABC, he added a huge amount of music and went as far back as 1964. He added [[Beatles]], [[Motown]] 60's hits, 70's rock hits, a few album rock cuts, and basically deepened WABC's music. The same amount of current hits still got played but less often and about 40%. That November, he let [[Harry Harrison (DJ)|Harry Harrison]], George Michael, and [[Chuck Leonard]] go. He made a couple shifts longer, moved [[Dan Ingram]] to mornings, moved Bob Cruz from overnights to afternoons, and hired [[Howard Hoffman]] for evenings. For overnights he hired Sturgis Griffin and eliminated the late night shift merging that with evenings and overnights. In the first six months of 1980, ratings were slightly up and stable. Also, Brady made a deal for WABC to air [[New York Yankees]] baseball beginning the next year in 1981, though the station carried a few Yankee games from 1010 [[WINS (AM)|WINS]] during Republican Convention week in 1980. It was the first sign of the beginning of the end for the music format of WABC.\n\n====\"77 WABC, New York's Radio Station\" and the transition to talk====\nAl Brady left WABC in July 1980 and soon became General Manager of crosstown [[WQHT|WYNY]], which by then had a similar format to their then-fraternal twin sister station WNBC, as well as WABC. That fall, Jay Clark took over as program director at WABC. Jeff Mazzei arrived as assistant program director from crosstown WNEW (which was moving from adult contemporary to big bands and standards).\n\nUnder Clark, the station played current music leaning toward a more Adult Contemporary sound, trying to appeal to a slightly older audience, as most younger listeners had moved to the FM dial. Part of the reason was the Top 40 chart was leaning that way at that point as well. So WABC still played rock and soul crossovers in moderation, but began to move away from album cuts and more toward 1960s and 1970s oldies. In September 1980, they also dropped the \"Musicradio WABC\" slogan and became \"77 WABC, New York's Radio Station\" (though they called themselves New York's radio station at times as Musicradio), the apparent implication being that the station was more than just music.\n\nBy early 1981, WABC's cumulative audience was down to 2.5 million\u2014rival WNBC, a perennial also-ran, was by this time beating them with 3 million. Fewer people were tuning into WABC, listeners who had switched to FM were not coming back, and, while still moderately successful, the ship was sinking. Like Al Brady Law, Jay Clark tried to improve the time-spent-listening. In March 1981, Bob Cruz departed, Dan Ingram went back to his familiar afternoon slot, and the team of Ross Brittain and Brian Wilson from [[Atlanta]] moved into morning drive. ''Ross and Wilson'', as the show was known, was very information-oriented, playing exactly four songs in an hour except on Saturdays when they played the usual 12 or so songs an hour. A week later, the station also began airing a weeknight sports-talk show with [[Art Rust, Jr.]] from 7 to 9 pm. WABC's ratings by this point were mediocre and they were still going down.\n\nAlso, that March, WABC became the full-time flagship radio outlet for Yankees baseball games, a distinction the station carried through the end of the 2001 season. This would be the longest continuous relationship the team would have with any flagship station (to date). Jay Clark reasoned that Yankee baseball would bring back some listeners to the station and that they would recycle back into the music format, but not even the \"Bronx Bombers\" could save music on WABC.\n\nIn the fall of 1981, WABC dropped the remaining heavy-rock cuts and non-crossover urban hits. They began playing more oldies, as well as songs from the adult contemporary chart, and added an \"advice\" talk show with Dr. Judy Kuriansky from 9&nbsp;pm to midnight on weeknights. Howard Hoffman and Sturgis Griffin exited at this point. By then, WABC was almost unrecognizable as a Top 40 station, the ratings were languishing, and rumors, which began as far back as 1979 were rampant that the station would be changing its format to talk and news sooner or later. By early 1982 it looked sooner than later. The management at ABC denied the rumors but did state that plans were to modify WABC into a Full Service AC format with music by day and talk evenings and overnights like [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] [[Pittsburgh]] was doing. Once a week beginning in February, WABC was auditioning prospective talk shows for the Midnight to 2 a.m. time slot.\n\nIn February 1982, WABC officially confirmed it would be going to an all-talk format that May. They stated that there would be ample notice before the switch happens. At that point the once a week overnight auditions for talk shows ended and WABC continued playing music overnights until the switch. The airstaff began saying goodbye with a comment here and there from February into May. Finally, on April 30, it was announced that the switch to all-talk would occur on May 10 at noon. From May 7 to 9, the departing station air-staffers said their goodbyes one last time. The official music format ended 10:45&nbsp;p.m. May 9, 1982. The station aired the Yankee game that day at [[Seattle Mariners|Seattle]]. From 2 a.m. to 5:30&nbsp;a.m. they ran the normal Sunday evening public affairs programs preempted due to the Yankee game. Ross & Wilson played their usual 4 songs and the music ended with a tribute show from 9 a.m. to noon May 10 hosted by Ron Lundy & Dan Ingram. Staffers that departed included Ron Lundy, Dan Ingram, Marc Sommers and Peter Bush. Assistant Program Director Jeff Mazzei left for a similar position at WCBS-FM where he would stay for well over 25 years. Marc Sommers also went to WCBS-FM and eventually Ron Lundy and Dan Ingram would join him there. Johnny Donovan and Mike McKay remained at WABC as staff announcers and producers. Mike McKay left WABC in 1984 for [[RKO Radio Network]] and Johnny Donovan stayed at WABC until his retirement in 2015.\n\nMonday, May 10, 1982, the day WABC stopped playing music, is sometimes called{{By whom|date=March 2011}} \"[[The Day the Music Died]]\". WABC ended its 22-year run as a music station with a 9&nbsp;am\u2013noon farewell show hosted by Dan Ingram and Ron Lundy. The last song played on WABC before the format change was \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\" by [[John Lennon]], followed by the familiar WABC \"Chime Time\" jingle, then a few seconds of silence followed by a minute jingle for talk radio before the debut of the new talk format.\n\n===The NewsTalkRadio 77 era (1982-current)===\n====Early years and success====\n\nInitially after the format change, the station ran satellite talk shows from corporate ABC's \"Talk Radio\" network. Initially, WABC's lineup consisted of Ross and Wilson until 10&nbsp;am, Owen Spann from Satellite until noon, Art Athens and News until 1&nbsp;pm, Money Management talk until 2&nbsp;pm, [[Michael Jackson (radio commentator)|Michael Jackson]] (a talk show host and not [[Michael Jackson|the late pop star]]) from satellite until 4&nbsp;pm, another advice show with Dr. Toni Grant from satellite until 6&nbsp;pm, and ending with a half-hour of news at 6. Sports Talk began at 6:30&nbsp;pm and remained on until 9 pm. Doctor Judy remained in her time slot. Overnights were hosted by [[Alan Colmes]], who played some music initially, but he stopped playing it by mid-1983. At that time, he was less politically based and more entertainment-based. Weekends had Child Psychology advice shows (Dr. Lawrance Balter), Home and Garden shows, talk about religion (Religion on the Line), and of course, the Yankees.\n\nRoss and Wilson stayed on and continued to play 4 songs per hour (mostly 1960s and 1970s hits but also some currents) throughout 1982. In 1983, they stopped playing music as well. Ross and Wilson split up in 1983 when Ross went over to [[WHTZ]]. While the station's final ratings as a music station were mediocre, their talk ratings initially were even lower. Jay Clark was terminated and replaced with then Assist. PD, Mark Mason.\n\nStill, the station stuck with the new format. After Brian Wilson left in 1984, Alan Colmes moved to mornings. Mark Mason left for a similar post at All-News WINS. He was replaced by John Mainelli and at that point they dropped satellite programming. They added more issues-oriented talk shows, with an increasing number of conservative talk show hosts, although several liberals, including Colmes and Lynn Samuels, also hosted shows. The ratings grew and by the late 1980s, they were a very successful talk station.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1996 WABC broadcast the popular [[Bob Grant (radio host)|Bob Grant]], a controversial, early \"right-wing\" talk radio host. After years of what many considered inflammatory remarks, he was fired in 1996 for a controversial comment regarding the death of United States Secretary of Commerce [[Ron Brown]]. After a number of years at competitor station WOR, Grant returned as a host as of July 2007, was removed again in December 2008, and returned again as a weekend host in September 2009. Alan Colmes would leave in 1985 and by 1987 he emerged at WNBC on overnights, where he played moderate amounts of music there. He would move to afternoons on WNBC and eventually drop music there as well. He was on the air at WNBC's sign off in 1988. Colmes eventually returned to WABC.\n\nWithin its first years, the revamped WABC brought in [[Rush Limbaugh]], who would go on to be the anchor program of the local station for two decades, and soon after the giant of talk syndication, the model for countless other conservative radio shows to follow. In the early 1990s [[Phil Boyce]] took over as program director.\n\nOn Saturday September 8, 2001, John Batchelor presented a four-hour program on the attack on the USS ''Cole,'' identifying Osama bin Laden as the probable perpetrator.  On September 12, Batchelor was invited to broadcast on WABC \u201cuntil bin Laden is captured.\u201d The day bin Laden was caught, Batchelor and his executive producer were in Cracow; they continued on air and, with a hiatus in 2006, have been on air ever since, covering national and international security.\n\nIn 2004, the station earned the distinction of being a news/talk radio station even longer than it had been a Top 40 station, by marking 22 years in its present format.\n\n====Under Citadel and Cumulus====\n[[File:77 WABC word logo 2000s.png|left|thumb|77 WABC logo prior to 2011]]\nOn February 6, 2006, the Walt Disney Company announced that it would sell WABC and other radio properties not affiliated with either [[Radio Disney]] or [[ESPN Radio]], along with ABC Radio's [[ABC News & Talk|News & Talk]] and FM networks, to [[Citadel Broadcasting Corporation]] for $2.7 billion.

Imus was fired from WFAN in April for controversial comments about Rutgers University's women's basketball team. [[Connell McShane]] (who had replaced [[Charles McCord]] following his retirement on May 5, 2011) served as sidekick and newscaster for the program, which was also simulcast on the [[Fox Business Network]]. The Imus show aired for the final time on March 29, 2018.\n\n[[Geraldo Rivera]] became host of WABC's 10 a.m. to noon slot beginning January 3, 2012, replacing Joe Crummey; he was replaced with [[Fox News Radio]]'s [[Brian Kilmeade]] in 2019.\n\nOn January 1, 2013, the traffic reports on WABC switched from Clear Channel's Total Traffic to Radiate Media's Right Now Traffic.\n\nLimbaugh and Hannity departed WABC at the end of 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/rush-hannity-leaving-cumulus-wor-article-1.1411314|title=Rush Limbaugh rushing out of Cumulus Media to WOR, with Sean Hannity in tow|work=[[New York Daily News]]|last=Hinckley|first=David|date=July 28, 2013|accessdate=July 29, 2017}}</ref> To fill Limbaugh's spot, WABC revived ''Curtis and Kuby''; [[Curtis Sliwa]] had been hosting the morning show at [[WNYM]] since his departure from WABC while [[Ron Kuby]] had for the most part been a commentator on various news shows since his show on [[Air America Radio]] was cancelled.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/business/media/talk-radio-on-wabc-shifts-focus-to-the-local.html?_r=0/|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Ben|last=Sisario|title=Talk Radio on WABC Shifts Focus to the Local|date=January 2, 2014}}</ref> Kuby was laid off in 2017; Sliwa would subsequently be paired on-air with [[Rita Cosby]], followed by current co-host [[Juliet Huddy]].\n\n====Acquisition by Red Apple Media====\n\nOn June 27, 2019, Red Apple Media, which is owned by [[John Catsimatidis]], bought WABC from Cumulus Media for $12.5 million in cash.<ref name=nypost-catsimatidis /> The sale closed on March 2, 2020.<ref name=amny02032020/> Catsimatidis plans no changes at the station; he also hosts a regionally syndicated Sunday morning talk show currently based at competing station [[WNYM]].\n\n==Previous programs==\nMany talk show hosts on WABC have moved on to national syndication; WABC was where the nationally syndicated programs hosted by [[Rush Limbaugh]] and [[Sean Hannity]] got their start, although those programs are now heard on WABC's talk radio rival in New York, [[WOR (AM)|WOR]]. The station also served as the flagship for ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'' with [[Don Imus]] from 2007 to 2018.\n\nFlagship-wise, Limbaugh's show was produced at WABC from 1988 until the early 2000s, when he started doing the program from [[Premiere Radio Networks]] and a studio in his home in [[South Florida]]. (Even then, until WABC dropped the program, substitute hosts for Limbaugh still used the WABC studios, and Limbaugh on occasion had hosted from WABC.) ''Imus in the Morning'' had also originated from WABC, while Levin originates from Washington, D.C. sister station [[WMAL-FM]]. The latter two shows are now syndicated by [[Westwood One (current)|Westwood One]], the successor to the original \"ABC Radio Network\" (known as [[Citadel Media]] from 2009 until 2011, and as [[Cumulus Media Networks]] from 2011 until 2014).\n\nSome of the station's former locally based hosts include [[John R. Gambling]], [[Jay Diamond]], [[Ed Koch]], [[Lynn Samuels]], [[Joy Behar]], [[Mario Cuomo]], [[Steve Malzberg]], [[Richard Bey]], [[Lionel (radio personality)|Lionel]], Harley Carnes, [[Dick Oliver]], [[Penny Crone]], [[Sam Donaldson]], [[Jerry Agar]], [[Michael Kay (sports broadcaster)|Michael Kay]], [[James Golden (radio personality)|James Golden]] (in partnership with Joel Santisteban), [[Brian Whitman]] and [[Mancow Muller]]. Several nationally syndicated talkers have included [[Howard Cosell]], [[Ed Hardy]], [[Tom Snyder]], [[Art Bell]], [[Mike Gallagher (political commentator)|Mike Gallagher]] (first heard locally co-hosting with Penny Crone, later in a syndicated show), [[Laura Schlessinger]], [[Matt Drudge]] and [[Laura Ingraham]]. Long time WABC (AM) newsman [[George Weber (radio personality)|George Weber]], who reported the events on 9/11 for the station, was murdered in 2009. WABC also carried [[Paul Harvey]]'s newscasts during ''Imus in the Morning'' (''Paul Harvey News and Comment'') and in-between the midday host and Limbaugh (''The Rest of the Story'') up through Harvey's death in 2009.\n\nAlthough the station had good ratings, it underperformed in terms of total revenue, an example being WABC billing $21.3 million in 2008,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/04/13/2009-04-13_for_ads_wltws_at_the_top_of_the_bill.html|location=New York|work=[[New York Daily News]]|title=On the radio: For ads, WLTW's at the top of the bill|first=David|last=Hinckley|date=April 12, 2009}}</ref> not even close to industry giant [[KFI (AM)|KFI]] in Los Angeles at $54.4 million.\n\nPhil Boyce departed as program director in October 2008, eventually replaced in February 2009 by former [[XM Satellite Radio]] programmer Laurie Cantillo. Laurie Cantillo resigned on October 31, 2011. Chuck Armstrong was named interim program director in November 2011. Craig Schwalb was named Program Director in January 2014.\n\n==Current programming==\n===Weekdays===\nThe station features a lineup of [[conservative talk]] shows. WABC personalities [[Bernard McGuirk]] and [[Sid Rosenberg]] host the weekday morning show, followed by ''[[Brian Killmeade|The Brian Killmeade Show]]'', produced by [[Fox News Talk]] and syndicated via [[Westwood One (current)|Westwood One]]. WABC personalities [[Curtis Sliwa]] and [[Juliet Huddy]] co-host an early afternoon show, followed by ''[[The Ben Shapiro Show]]'' in the late afternoon, ''[[The Mark Levin Show]]'' in early evenings, ''[[The John Batchelor Show]]'' in late evenings and ''[[Red Eye Radio]]'' in the overnight hours, all of which via Westwood One. Both local talk shows on WABC have been ranked among ''[[Talkers Magazine]]'' \"Heavy Hundred\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkers.com/2019-talkers-heavy-hundred-1-25/ |title=2019 TALKERS Heavy Hundred (#23 - ''Bernie & Sid'') |publisher=Talkers.Com |accessdate=2019-06-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkers.com/2019-talkers-heavy-hundred-26-50/ |title=2019 TALKERS Heavy Hundred (#36 - ''Curtis & Juliet'') |publisher=Talkers.Com |accessdate=2019-06-29 }}</ref>\n\n===Sports programming===\nWABC currently carries no sports programming. The station's most recent sports contract, with the [[United States Military Academy]] for [[Army Black Knights football|Army football]] games, expired at the end of the [[2015 Army Black Knights football team|2015 season]]. In addition to the aforementioned Yankees coverage, the station served two separate stints as the flagship for the [[New York Jets]] and was also the home of the [[New Jersey Devils]] beginning in 1988. WABC also previously carried [[Seton Hall University]] [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|men's basketball]].\n\nEarly in its Top 40 incarnation, WABC served as the original radio flagship of the [[New York Mets]] upon their establishment in 1962. A notable aspect of WABC's Mets coverage was [[Howard Cosell]] and former [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] pitcher [[Ralph Branca]] handling the pre- and post-game shows. The station lost those rights to [[WEPN (AM)|WHN]] following the 1963 season.\n\nThe Jets first called WABC home in the 1980s, but left toward the end of the decade for WCBS. The team would return to the station in 2000 after spending the previous seven seasons on [[WFAN]]. After then-sister station [[WEPN (AM)|WEPN]] became the Jets' flagship, WABC began simulcasting the games over their airwaves due to its stronger signal. The arrangement ended in 2008 as WEPN began simulcasting all its programming on two other stations.\n\nIn December 2001, broadcast rights to the Yankees were lost after 21 years to WCBS. WABC also lost the radio rights to the Devils in 2005, as New Jersey's hockey team moved to WFAN to substitute for the station's loss of the [[New York Rangers]] to WEPN. WABC served as an overflow station for the Rangers from 2005 through 2009, and also served the same purpose for the [[New York Knicks]] when their games moved from WFAN to WEPN, but those rights moved to [[WNYM]] in 2009. The loss of evening sports programming has forced WABC to attempt to solidify its evening talk lineup.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official|https://www.wabcradio.com}}\n*{{FCC letter|letterid=46284|hcards=yes|callsign=WABC}}{{AM station data|WABC}}\n* [http://www.wabccountry.com/ WABC Country (For WABC branded stream of country music)]\n* [http://www.musicradio77.com/ Musicradio 77 WABC (1960 to 1982) tribute site]\n* [http://www.nyradionews.com/wabc/ WABC News Historical Profile & Interviews (1978)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071211212303/http://wabctribute.com/ WABC Tribute Slideshow Movie]\n* [http://www.pophistorynow.com/samples.htm The 1960s Week-By-Week featuring in-depth news of the WMCA-WINS-WABC top-40 wars including ratings]\n* [https://archive.is/20130201051544/http://www.radio-history.com/nj2/piratejim/nycamhistory2.html Radio-History.com information on WJZ-AM]\n\n{{New York Radio}}\n{{News/Talk Radio Stations in New York}}\n{{Cumulus Media}}\n{{Clear Channel AM}}\n{{New York Mets broadcasters}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in New York City|ABC]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1921]]\n[[Category:Westinghouse Broadcasting]]\n[[Category:News and talk radio stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Cumulus Media radio stations]]\n[[Category:1921 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:New Jersey Devils broadcasters]]\n[[Category:New York Jets broadcasters]]\n[[Category:New York Yankees broadcasters]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Clear-channel talk radio station in New York City}}\n{{About|the radio station currently using the call letters WABC|the station known as WABC from 1926 to 1946|WCBS (AM)}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2012}}\n{{Original research|date=January 2012}}\n}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2012}}\n{{Infobox radio station\n| name = WABC\n| image = 77 WABC word logo 2011 gold.png\n| city = [[New York City|New York, New York]]\n| area = [[New York metropolitan area]]\n| branding = 77 WABC Radio\n| slogan = Where New York Comes To Talk.\n| airdate = {{start date and age|1921|10|01}}\n| frequency = {{Frequency|770|[[Hertz|kHz]]}}\n| format = [[All-news radio|News]]/[[Talk radio|Talk]]\n| power = 50,000 [[watt]]s (unlimited)\n| class = A ([[Clear-channel station|Clear channel]])\n| facility_id = 70658\n| callsign_meaning = formerly owned by the [[American Broadcasting Company|<u>A</u>merican <u>B</u>roadcasting <u>C</u>ompany]]\n| former_callsigns = WJZ (1921&ndash;1953)\n| owner = [[John Catsimatidis|Red Apple Media (John Catsimatidis)]]<ref name=nypost-catsimatidis>{{cite news|title=John Catsimatidis acquires 77 WABC radio for $12.5 million|url=https://nypost.com/2019/06/27/john-catsimatidis-acquires-77-wabc-radio-for-12-5-million/|accessdate=June 28, 2019|newspaper=New York Post|date=June 27, 2019}}</ref><ref name=amny02032020>{{cite web |url=https://www.amny.com/entertainment/new-york-city-radio-station-talkradio-77-wabc-under-new-ownership/|title=New York City radio station TALKRADIO 77 WABC under new ownership|last=Davenport|first=Emily|date=2 March 2020|website=amny.com|access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n| licensee = \n| sister_stations = \n| affiliations = [[Westwood One]]<br>[[Westwood One News]]\n| webcast =\n| website = {{url|wabcradio.com}}\n| coordinates = {{coord|40|52|50|N|74|4|10|W|type:landmark_region:US-NY_source:FCC}} (main)<br>{{coord|40|52|50|N|74|4|5|W|type:landmark_region:US-NY_source:FCC}} (auxiliary)\n}}\n\n'''WABC''' (770 [[AM broadcasting|AM]]) &ndash; branded on-air as ''77&nbsp;WABC'' &ndash; is a commercial [[talk radio]] [[Radio broadcasting|station]] licensed to serve [[New York City]].

The station shares studio facilities with former sister station [[WNBM]] above [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] in [[Midtown Manhattan]], and its transmitter is located in [[Lodi, New Jersey]]. Its 50,000 watt non-directional [[Clear-channel station|clear channel]] signal can be heard at night throughout much of the eastern United States and Canada, and it is the primary entry point for the [[Emergency Alert System]] in the [[New York metropolitan area]]. \n\nOne of the country's oldest radio stations, WABC began broadcasting in early October 1921, originally as WJZ in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. For much of its history, the station had served as the flagship for [[Cumulus Media Networks|the original ABC Radio Network]] (and their direct predecessor, the [[Blue Network]]) and ABC's [[ABC News Radio|radio news service]]. While WABC has programmed a talk radio [[radio format|format]] since 1982, the station broadcast a [[Top 40]] music format from 1960 to 1981. Prior to 1978, WABC was not only the dominant contemporary music station in [[New York City]], but was also among the most listened to radio stations in North America, serving as a template for many other Top 40 stations around the country.\n\n==History==\n===WJZ Newark (1921-1923)===\n[[File:1922 WJZ Newark radio studio.JPEG|thumb|325px|Original WJZ Newark studio.

This initial station proved successful, so the next year the company developed plans to set up additional stations in major population centers, including, in addition to the New York City area, [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]], originally in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], and [[KYW (AM)|KYW]], originally in [[Chicago, Illinois]].\n\nOn September 30, 1921, Westinghouse was issued a broadcasting authorization for a station with the randomly assigned call letters WJZ,<ref>It has been speculated that the call letters might have signified New '''J'''er('''Z''')sey; however, this appears to be a case of [[folk etymology]], as there are no contemporary references to support this.</ref> located at the company's meter factory at Orange and Plane streets in [[Newark, New Jersey]], and transmitting on a wavelength of 360 meters (833&nbsp;kHz).<ref>Limited Commercial license, serial #230, issued September 30, 1921, for a one-year term.

A popular early feature was the \"Man in the Moon\" bedtime stories, written by [[Josephine Lawrence]] and read over the air by Bill McNeary (both were ''Newark Sunday Call'' employees). Beginning on November 27, 1921, a weekly 90-minute show presented by the [[Vincent Lopez]] band was aired.<ref>Pat Browne,''The guide to United States popular culture''. Popular Press, 2001, p.611. {{ISBN|0-87972-821-3}}</ref>\n\nWhen it began its broadcast service, WJZ was the only station in the [[Tri-State Region|New York City area]] transmitting on 360 meters. In mid-December 1921 station [[WDY]], operated by the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) from Roselle Park, New Jersey, began sharing the wavelength, with WJZ now broadcasting on Sundays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays and WDY operating on the other three nights. This soon ended when WDY ceased operations in mid-February 1922 and was merged with WJZ, with RCA now assuming half of WJZ's expenses. However, within a few months a large number of additional broadcasting stations began operating on 360 meters, and WJZ was stubborn about having to share \"its\" wavelength. In May 1922 a proposed time-sharing agreement among 15 local stations assigned more than half of the available airtime to WJZ, but the station did not feel this was sufficient, which in turn led the Radio Broadcasting Society of America to petition that WJZ's license be canceled for being uncooperative.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015013717361&view=1up&seq=471 \"War Between Broadcasting Stations\"], ''Radio Broadcast'', October 1922, pages 457-458.</ref>\n\n[[File:1922 Man in the Moon bedtime story poster.JPEG|thumb|250px|The nightly \"Man in the Moon\" bedtime stories were a popular early feature.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/radiodealer02unse#page/n89/mode/2up|title=Advertisement for Clark and Tilson Company|work=The Radio Dealer|issue=Vol. 2 No. 1|date=October 1922|pages=84\u201385|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}</ref>]]\nThere were no formal standards in the United States defining broadcasting stations until December 1, 1921, when the Department of Commerce\u2014which regulated radio at this time-issued a regulation specifying that stations making broadcasts intended for the general public now had to hold a Limited Commercial license that authorized operation on 360 or 485 meters.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435066705633&view=1up&seq=200|title=Amendments to Regulations|work=[[Bureau of Navigation]] [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] Radio Service Bulletin|page=10|date=January 3, 1922|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}</ref> WJZ was one of a small number of stations that already met this standard at the time of its adoption. It was also the second oldest of the two licenses previously issued for the state of New Jersey, preceded by RCA's WDY grant. However, WJZ was the first to go on the air, as WDY didn't begin operations until two and a half months after WJZ's debut.\n\nWJZ had difficulty convincing New York City performers \u2013 who were not paid \u2013 to make the trek to Newark, so on February 5, 1922 a more convenient remote studio was opened at the [[Waldorf\u2013Astoria (New York, 1893)|Waldorf-Astoria]], located on Fifth Avenue and Thirty-Fourth Street.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112061168321&view=1up&seq=258 \"WJZ Opens New Studio\"], ''National Electragist (Radio Service Supplement)'', March 1923, page 4.</ref> The [[AT&T Corporation|American Telephone & Telegraph Company]] (AT&T) was unwilling to provide a telephone line to connect the Waldorf-Astoria studio to the Newark transmitter, so the link was instead made using specially prepared telegraph wires provided by [[Western Union]]. However, this expedient only provided marginal audio quality, and \"the line was so noisy that when Newcomb Carleton, the president of Western Union, broadcast over it, his voice was completely drowned out\".<ref>''Sarnoff: An American Success'' by [[Carl Dreher]], 1977, page 73.</ref>\n\nOn March 15, 1922, WJZ broadcast a studio performance of [[The Impresario|Mozart's Impresario]], probably the first full-length opera broadcast in the New York City area. In October 1922, the station aired its second [[1922 World Series|World Series]], this time also feeding it to [[WGY (AM)|WGY]] in [[Schenectady, New York]]. Shortly after midnight on December 9, 1922, WJZ became the first broadcasting station confirmed to have been heard in Europe, consisting of a short program featuring greetings from the British consul in New York to British listeners and [[Oliver Twist (Vaughn De Leath song)|Vaughn De Leath singing her \"Oliver Twist\" song]].\n\n===WJZ New York City (1923-1953)===\n====Takeover by RCA====\nMay 15, 1923 saw a number of simultaneous major changes. Most notably, on this day the station moved from Newark to New York City, and the ownership was changed from joint Westinghouse-RCA responsibility to full control by RCA. WJZ now occupied studios on the sixth floor of the building where the [[Aeolian Hall (New York)|Aeolian Hall]] was located, and station publicity heralded the upgrade: \"Located in the heart of the city's musical and theatrical district, where entertainment of the highest order is ever available, this station will offer to the American public the most elaborate radio programs yet attempted and with a degree of faithfulness in reproduction that marks the beginning of a new era in radio broadcasting.\"<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112061168321&view=1up&seq=340 \"New York's Super Station\"], ''National Electragist'', June 1923, pages 44, 46.</ref> This was also the day that the Department of Commerce implemented an expansion of the broadcast band, which now consisted of a range of transmitting frequencies from 550 to 1350, with WJZ assigned the sole use of 660. Finally, a sister station with the call letters of [[WJY (New York City)|WJY]] operating on 740, was established, which shared the \"Broadcast Central\" Aeolian Hall studios, with WJZ providing more serious programming, and WJY's offerings considered more informal.\n\nProgram logs from May 15 to December 31, 1923, show WJZ aired 3426 programs, including 723 talks, 67 church services, 205 bedtime stories and 21 sports events. Many of the broadcasts were musical and ranged from [[Carnegie Hall]] and Aeolian Hall recitals to harmonica and banjo solos.\n\nAs part of the move to Aeolian Hall, WJZ's transmitting antenna was constructed atop the building, but the location in the middle of New York City proved to be a poor choice. At the end of 1925, the station began operations from a new transmitter site located at [[Bound Brook, New Jersey]]. However, this overwhelmed several other stations on the air, forcing WJZ engineers to visit homes in central New Jersey to deal with the complaints.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} As a result, WJZ didn't operate regularly at 50,000 watts until 1935.\n\n====Initial network operations====\nWestinghouse and RCA's original financing plan envisioned that profits from receiver sales would provide the funds for broadcast station operations, but this revenue soon became insufficient. In 1922, AT&T adopted a more practical approach, of selling airtime, which it called \"toll broadcasting\", in addition to connecting stations together using telephone lines to form a radio network that could broadcast programs simultaneously to multiple sites. This first radio network was called the \"WEAF chain\", named after the flagship AT&T station (later [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]]; now [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN]]), located in New York City.\n\nRCA, along with its \"radio group\" allies of Westinghouse and General Electric, responded by creating a small network of their own, centered on WJZ. Due to AT&T's interpretation of a patent-rights cross-licensing agreement, the telephone company claimed the sole right to sell airtime, so WJZ was not able to charge for advertising, and again there were technical limitations, since the network had to use inferior telegraph lines to interconnect its stations.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/radiobroadcast09gardrich#page/n316/mode/1up|title=How Much It Costs to Broadcast|work=Radio Broadcast|issue=Vol. IX No. 5|last=Lescarboura|first=Austin C.|date=September 1926|pages=367\u2013371|accessdate=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====NBC-Blue network flagship years====\n[[File:Dennis King 1934.JPG|thumb|180px|Actor and vocalist [[Dennis King]] had a weekly network radio program on WJZ in 1934.]]\nIn the summer of 1926, AT&T decided to withdraw from the broadcasting field, and sold its stations and network operations to RCA. Included with this sale was the right to sell advertising time, and access to telephone lines for radio network connections.\n\nThe earlier network operations were reorganized as the [[National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC), with the primary network, now known as the [[NBC Red Network]], originating from WEAF. A second network, known as the [[NBC Blue Network]], with WJZ as the originating station, debuted on January 1, 1927. (The WJY sister station was quietly discontinued at this time.) In October 1927, WJZ moved into NBC studios still under construction at 711 Fifth Avenue. A month later, WEAF joined WJZ, and both were together under one roof. On November 11, 1928, as part of a general station reassignment produced by the [[Federal Radio Commission]]'s [[General Order 40]], WJZ moved to 760&nbsp;kHz.\n\nOn March 24, 1932, WJZ became the first radio station to broadcast a program from aboard a moving train; the station aired a variety show produced aboard a [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] passenger train travelling through Maryland.<ref>Rivanna Chapter National Railway Historical Society, ''[http://avenue.org/nrhs/histmar.htm This Month in Railroad History: March]''.  Retrieved March 24, 2006.</ref> In November 1933, WJZ, WEAF plus the NBC and RCA corporate headquarters moved to [[Rockefeller Center|30 Rockefeller Plaza]].\n\nIn 1941, under the provisions of the [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement]], stations assigned to 760&nbsp;kHz were shifted to 770&nbsp;kHz, which has been WJZ/WABC's dial position ever since.\n\nWJZ and the Blue Network presented many of America's most popular programs, such as ''[[Lowell Thomas|Lowell Thomas and the News]]'', ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'', ''[[America's Town Meeting of the Air]]'', and ''[[Death Valley Days]]''. Each midday, ''[[The National Farm and Home Hour]]'' brought news and entertainment to rural listeners. [[Ted Malone]] read poetry and [[Milton Cross]] conveyed children \"Coast To Coast on a Bus\", as well as bringing opera lovers the Saturday matin\u00e9e [[Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts]]. Cross would continue to host the Met on NBC, ABC, CBS and NPR until his passing at the beginning of 1975.\n\nOccasionally, a show would premiere on NBC Blue, which had a weaker lineup of stations nationwide, and be shifted to the Red Network if it grew in popularity. ''[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]'' is one example.\n\nWhen the FCC limited broadcast stations to 50&nbsp;kW, a 500&nbsp;kW transmitter built by RCA for WJZ was no longer allowed. The transmitter was sold by RCA to Britain and used for wartime [[Black Propaganda]]; broadcasting as ''[[Soldatensender Calais]]'' a purported German military station.\n\n===Birth of ABC===\nIn 1942, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) ruled that no broadcaster could own more than one AM, one FM and one television station in a single market. On January 23, 1942, the FCC approved the transfer of WJZ's operating license from Radio Corporation of America to the Blue Network, Inc.<ref>{{cite news|title=FCC Okays Transfer of WJZ, KGO, WENR|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DgwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=6|accessdate=30 October 2014|agency=Billboard|date=January 31, 1942}}</ref> A year later, on October 12, 1943, WJZ and the NBC Blue Network were sold to [[Edward J. Noble]], then the owner of [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]]. Technically, this spun off network was simply called \"The Blue Network\" for little over a year.\n\nOn June 15, 1945, \"The Blue Network\" was officially rechristened the [[American Broadcasting Company]], when negotiations were completed with [[Storer Broadcasting|George B. Storer]], who had owned the defunct American Broadcasting System and still owned the name. In November 1948, WJZ and the ABC network finally got a home of their own when studios were moved to a renovated building at 7 West 66th Street.\n\n[[File:WJZ now WABC advertisement (1953).jpg|thumb|1953 advertisement announcing the call letter change from WJZ to WABC.<ref name=\"callchange\">{{cite magazine|title=WABC and WABC-TV ad|url=https://archive.org/stream/broadcastingtele44unse#page/n904/mode/1up|accessdate=March 14, 2018|work=Broadcasting Telecasting|issue=Vol. 44, No. 9|date=March 2, 1953|page=37}}</ref>]]\nOn March 1, 1953, WJZ changed its call letters to WABC, after the FCC approved ABC's merger with [[United Paramount Theatres]], the movie theater chain owned by [[Paramount Pictures]] which, like the Blue Network, was divested under government order.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Ambitious ABC Planning Initiated Under New Merged Ownership|url=https://archive.org/stream/broadcastingtele44unse#page/n658/mode/1up|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=Broadcasting Telecasting|issue=Vol. 44, No. 7|date=February 16, 1953|pages=27\u201329}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=It's now WABC-AM-FM-TV; ABC also changes slides|url=https://archive.org/stream/broadcastingtele44unse#page/n937/mode/1up|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=Broadcasting Telecasting|issue=Vol. 44, No. 9|date=March 2, 1953|page=70}}</ref><ref name=\"callchange\" /> The WABC call letters were previously used on [[CBS Radio]]'s New York City AM and FM outlets (having taken the callsign as a reflection of original owner Atlantic Broadcasting Company), before adopting their current [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] and [[WCBS-FM]] identities in November 1946 and September 1947, respectively.\n\nIn 1957, several years after WJZ's callsign change to WABC, Westinghouse Broadcasting acquired WAAM-TV in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and applied to change the calls to [[WJZ-TV]], in honor of its former pioneer radio station.<ref>{{cite web|title=WBC's WAAM (TV) buy: $4.4 million. |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/57-OCR/1957-05-13-BC-OCR-Page-0098.pdf |periodical=Broadcasting - Telecasting |page=112 |date=May 13, 1957}}</ref> The FCC waived existing rules and granted this request to restore a three-letter callsign years after being retired on an unrelated station in a different market, albeit with a \"-TV\" suffix (perhaps because Westinghouse was highly regarded as a licensee by both the industry and the FCC at that time),<ref>{{cite web|title=WAAM (TV) becomes WJZ-TV as FCC waives call rule. |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/57-OCR/1957-08-05-BC-OCR-Page-0092.pdf |periodical=Broadcasting - Telecasting |page=92 |date=August 5, 1957}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Stations (continued, top of page). |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/57-OCR/1957-08-12-BC-OCR-Page-0094.pdf |periodical=Broadcasting - Telecasting |page=94 |date=August 12, 1957}}</ref> and the Baltimore TV station, now owned and operated by [[CBS]], retains the call letters to this day. CBS later applied the call sign to Baltimore-area radio stations [[WJZ (AM)]] and [[WJZ-FM]], which are now owned by [[Entercom]].\n\n===WABC's first era (1953-1960)===\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\nAlthough WABC continued to air ABC programming during this time, ABC Radio \u2013 like the other major radio networks of that era \u2013 began to drop significant amounts of long-form comedy and dramatic programming, many of which migrated over to television. In response, WABC began using deejays playing recorded music in greater frequency. Some programs featured [[Middle of the road (music)|middle of the road music]], including Broadway and Hollywood showtunes and popular music, while other portions of the schedule included ABC Radio's remaining long-form newscasts and dramatic program lineup, in tandem with CBS Radio's WCBS and NBC Radio's [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]].\n\n(This would continue until 1960, as the Musicradio 77 era formally began, but WABC was still required to carry several of ABC Radio's non-music and entertainment shows, including the long-running ''[[Don McNeill (performer)|Don McNeill's]] [[Don McNeill's Breakfast Club|Breakfast Club]]'' during the 10:00&nbsp;am hour, and a long-form news block in the afternoon-drive period. While this was not an issue prior to 1960, such commitments created a programming clash with the Top 40 format up until the network was dissected into four sub-networks in 1968.)\n\nIn 1958\u20131959, legendary rock'n'roll disk jockey [[Alan Freed]] hosted a daily evening show on WABC, which was similar in format and musical policy to the early rock shows he had gained fame with on [[WKNR|WJW]] in Cleveland, and later [[WINS (AM)#Rock and roll|WINS]] in New York. Freed's time at WABC ended when he was caught up in the investigation of the \"[[payola]]\" scandals of the era.\n\nAt different times in the pre-top-40 era, famed comedian [[Ernie Kovacs]] and dean of early disc jockeys [[Martin Block]] were heard on the station.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.erniekovacs.net/images/radio.jpg|title=Mayhem in the A.M.; WABC ad for The Ernie Kovacs Show|date=May 30, 1955|magazine=Broadcasting|accessdate=January 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928150426/http://www.erniekovacs.net/images/radio.jpg#|archive-date=September 28, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tLs_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=lVcMAAAAIBAJ&pg=994,218743&dq=martin+block&hl=en|title=Disk Jockey, ABC Sign Big Contract|date=March 17, 1953|publisher=Youngstown Vindicator|accessdate=January 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===The Musicradio 77 era (1960-1982)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\n\n====Early years====\nWhen Harold L. Neal, Jr. was named General Manager of WABC, he was charged with making WABC successful in terms of both audience and profits. Neal had been at [[WXYT (AM)|WXYZ]] in Detroit. By 1960, WABC was committed to a nearly full-time schedule of [[top-40]] songs played by upbeat personalities. Still, WABC played popular non-rock and roll songs as well, provided they scored well on the Top 40 charts. WABC's early days as a [[Top 40]] station were humble ones.\n\n[[WINS (AM)|WINS]] was the No. 1 hit music station and [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]], which did a similar rock leaning top 40 format, was also a formidable competitor, while WABC barely ranked in the Top Ten. Fortunately for WABC, the other Top 40 outlets could not be heard as well in more distant New York and [[New Jersey]] suburbs, since WINS, [[WEPN (AM)|WMGM]], and WMCA were all directional stations. WABC, with its 50,000-watt non-directional signal, had the advantage of being heard in places west, south, and northwest of New York City, a huge chunk of the growing suburban population and this is where the station began to draw ratings. Early in 1962, WMGM, owned by Loew's, which then owned [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], was sold to [[Storer Broadcasting]]. Upon its sale, WMGM reverted to its original [[WEPN (AM)#WHN|WHN]] call letters and switched to a middle of the road music format playing mostly non-rock artists such as [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Andy Williams]].\n\nSam Holman was the first WABC program director of this era. Under Holman, WABC achieved No. 1 ratings during much of 1962, after WMGM reverted to WHN. By the summer of 1963, WMCA led the pack among contemporary stations, with WABC at No. 2 and WINS slipping to third place. It has been said, but is difficult to verify, that WMCA dominated in the city proper, while WABC owned the suburbs. This would be consistent with WMCA's 5,000-watt directional signal.\n\n====Dominant years====\nHal Neal hired [[Rick Sklar]] as WABC's program director. He would go on to become a member of the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]] and be credited as one of the pioneering architects of the Top 40 format. Under Sklar, the station went to the shortest playlist of any contemporary music station in history. The number one song was heard about every hour during the day and every 75 minutes or so at night. The other top 5 songs were heard nearly as often. Other current songs averaged once to twice per airshift. The station played about 9 current hits per hour and several non-current songs. The non-currents were no more than 5 years old and the station played about 70 of them in total. In his book ''Rockin' America'', Sklar said he was sensitive to [[payola]] concerns and advanced airplay. Through the years, WABC was known by various slogans, \"Channel 77 WABC\" and later \"Musicradio 77 WABC\". Due to the high number of commercials each hour, WABC played no more than two songs in a row and there was frequent DJ talk and personality between every song. The station averaged 6 commercial breaks per hour but they were no more than 3 ads in a row. Often the air personalities delivered live commercials in their own humorous style, so that listeners would consider the spot part of the entertainment.\n\nEarly 1960s disc jockeys included [[Dan Ingram]], Herb Oscar Anderson, Charlie Greer, [[Scott Muni]], Chuck Dunaway, Jack Carney and Bob \"Bobaloo\" Lewis. But some of the best known WABC DJs are the ones that followed them in the mid-1960s and 1970s: [[Harry Harrison (DJ)|Harry Harrison]], [[Ron Lundy]], [[Bruce Morrow|\"Cousin Brucie\"]], [[Chuck Leonard]] (one of the earliest African-American DJs to be on the staff of a major mainstream radio station), [[Johnny Donovan]], Bob Cruz (a Dan Ingram sound alike), [[Frank Kingston Smith]], [[Roby Yonge]], [[George Michael (sportscaster)|George Michael]], Jim Nettleton, [[Jim Perry (television personality)|Jim Perry]] and Steve O'Brien. Meanwhile, \"Radio Hall of Fame\" member Dan Ingram, perhaps WABC's best known DJ, was held over from the early staff, being heard in the afternoon for much of WABC's Top 40 history. Noted sportscaster [[Howard Cosell]] did a brief weekday evening sportscast on WABC, as well as hosting a late Sunday night interview show called \"Speaking of Everything.\"\n\nEspecially in the afternoons and evenings, WABC was the station that [[Adolescence|teenagers]] could be heard listening to on [[transistor radio]]s all over the [[New York metropolitan area]]. Due to its strong signal, the station could be heard easily over 100 miles away, including the [[Catskill Mountains|Catskill]] and [[Pocono Mountains]], and through much of [[Connecticut]] and [[Rhode Island]]. After sunset, when AM radio waves travel farther, WABC's signal could be picked up around much of the Eastern U.S. and Canada. Bruce Morrow often spoke about how he felt an almost psychic bond to his young listeners.\n\nA famous tape, or [[aircheck]], of WABC from August 1964 features some of the DJs speaking from a window of [[the Beatles]]' hotel room at the [[Drumpf Park Avenue|Hotel Delmonico]] during their second visit to New York City, while Dan Ingram, back in the studio, played WABC [[jingle]]s to thousands of teenagers in the streets below, who enthusiastically sang along with them. Ingram later noted that this was actually illegal under FCC rules, but said that they didn't know it at the time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musicradio WABC Beatles Page|url=http://www.musicradio77.com/beatles.html|work=Musicradio 77 WABC Information Page}}</ref> In the wake of the success of \"W-A-Beatle-C\" (as it was briefly called around the time of the Beatles' U.S. visit), competitor [[WINS (AM)|WINS]] finally dropped out of the Top 40 battle in 1965, adopting an all-news format. The ABC television network also called itself \"A-Beatles-C\" whenever it promoted airings of Beatles-related films.\n\nJust before the famous [[Northeast blackout of 1965]], Dan Ingram noted that the studio's electric power was fluctuating and he began having fun with the slowed-down music. After playing \"[[Everyone's Gone to the Moon]]\" by [[Jonathan King]], he quipped it was played \"in the key of R\". Ingram then proceeded to run some recorded commercials and a portion of [[Si Zentner]]'s \"Up a Lazy River\", backtimed to the news, while commenting on how everything seemed to be running slower than normal. During the 6&nbsp;pm newscast, WABC left the air as the outage settled in for real.<ref>[http://www.musicradio77.com/images/ing11-9-65blackout.mp3 1965 Blackout]</ref> Ingram later drove out to the transmitter site in Lodi, New Jersey, with a box of records, and continued his show from the backup studio housed there.\n\nIn the 1970s, WABC was either No. 1 or No. 2 consistently, often trading places with [[WOR (AM)|WOR]]. Once in a while, a station attracting an older audience (like [[WOR (AM)|WOR]] or [[WPAT (AM)|WPAT]]) would move into the top spot. These stations were not truly WABC's direct competitors because they targeted a much older audience. Chief competitor [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] began running evening talk by 1968 and stopped playing top 40 music altogether in the fall of 1970. Then in 1971, Country Music station WJRZ abruptly flipped to a Top 40 format and became known as [[WNYM|WWDJ]]. That lasted until April 1974. [[WEPN-FM|WOR-FM]] evolved from progressive rock to Adult Top 40 playing the hits of 1955 to current product by 1968. They dropped most pre-1964 oldies in 1972 and became known as WXLO 99X. That station evolved into more on an Adult Contemporary format in 1979 and a Rhythmic Top 40 format in 1980. Other [[Frequency modulation|FM]] competitors like oldies station [[WCBS-FM]], [[soul music|soul]] station [[WBLS]], and [[album-oriented rock]] stations like [[WPLJ]] and [[WNEW-FM]] all did well in the ratings, but none rivalled WABC's success. [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] competitor [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] also never came close to WABC's audience during this period. WNBC then had a format similar to 99X playing Adult Top 40. In 1977, WNBC tried sounding younger and moved their format musically closer to WABC. Then by 1979 they tried sounding older and somewhere in-between. Until 1978, WABC remained dominant.\n\nWABC's ratings strength came from its cumulative audience, what the radio industry calls \"cume\". Most listeners didn't stay with WABC for long periods of time, as the station had some of the shortest \"time spent listening\" (or TSL) spans in the history of music radio\u2014an average listener spent about 10 minutes listening to WABC. It was the price paid for a short playlist, and numerous commercials between songs (the large number of [[Radio advertisement|ads]] being due to WABC's large audience), but what WABC lacked in TSL it more than made up for with its sheer number of listeners. By 1975, WABC tried becoming more music-intensive, reducing commercial breaks to three per hour. It began playing 3 to 5 songs in a row, still mixed with talk and personality, but done in a tighter manner.\n\nFed up with the short playlist, Cousin Brucie left in August 1974 to defect to rival WNBC. Rick Sklar was promoted in 1976 to vice president of programming for [[Cumulus Media Networks|ABC Radio]], and his assistant program director Glenn Morgan became WABC's program director. The station's influence could be found in odd places: [[Philip Glass]]' 1976 opera, ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'', has as part of the background a recitation of WABC's DJ schedule in the 1960s.\n\n====\"Disco\" era====\nThe end of the 1970s found FM radio beginning to overtake AM music stations in most markets. In June 1975, an FM station on 92.3, owned by the San Juan (Puerto Rico) Racing Association flipped to Soft Rock and became known as Mellow 92 WKTU. That station had very low ratings and had no effect on WABC. But on July 24, 1978, at 6 PM, WKTU abruptly dropped its Soft Rock format in favor of a [[disco]]-based top 40 format known as \"Disco 92\". By December of that year, WABC was unseated, as WKTU became the No. 1 station in New York City. The first \"disco\" ratings saw WKTU with 11 percent of the listening audience\u2014a huge number anywhere, let alone in a market the size of New York City\u2014and WABC dropping from 4.1 million listeners to 3 million, losing 25 percent of its audience practically overnight.\n\nAfter this initial ratings tumble, WABC panicked and began mixing in several extended disco mixes per hour and sometimes played two back-to-back. Some of the disco songs ran in excess of eight minutes. What regular listeners heard was a major change in sound. While the station continued playing non-disco and rock songs about a third of the time, the station's familiar format had seemed to disappear and as a result, WABC began to lose its identity. In late spring 1979, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine reported that Rick Sklar had demoted program director Glenn Morgan to \"moving carts\" instead of making programming decisions. WABC's numbers dropped for four consecutive ratings periods.\n\nOn August 2, 1979, the [[Donna Summer]] disco hit \"[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]\" was playing during [[Dan Ingram]]'s afternoon drive program. During the song, DJ [[George Michael (sportscaster)|George Michael]] (who also was a sports reporter) interrupted to break the news that [[New York Yankees]] catcher and team captain [[Thurman Munson]] had died in a plane crash. In late summer, WABC moved, temporarily, back to their tight playlists.\n\nThat Fall, Al Brady took over as programming director of WABC. He had come from [[WHDH AM|WHDH]] [[Boston]], where he evolved that station from [[Middle of the road (music)|Middle of the Road]] to more of an [[Adult Contemporary]] format. At WABC, he added a huge amount of music and went as far back as 1964. He added [[Beatles]], [[Motown]] 60's hits, 70's rock hits, a few album rock cuts, and basically deepened WABC's music. The same amount of current hits still got played but less often and about 40%. That November, he let [[Harry Harrison (DJ)|Harry Harrison]], George Michael, and [[Chuck Leonard]] go. He made a couple shifts longer, moved [[Dan Ingram]] to mornings, moved Bob Cruz from overnights to afternoons, and hired [[Howard Hoffman]] for evenings. For overnights he hired Sturgis Griffin and eliminated the late night shift merging that with evenings and overnights. In the first six months of 1980, ratings were slightly up and stable. Also, Brady made a deal for WABC to air [[New York Yankees]] baseball beginning the next year in 1981, though the station carried a few Yankee games from 1010 [[WINS (AM)|WINS]] during Republican Convention week in 1980. It was the first sign of the beginning of the end for the music format of WABC.\n\n====\"77 WABC, New York's Radio Station\" and the transition to talk====\nAl Brady left WABC in July 1980 and soon became General Manager of crosstown [[WQHT|WYNY]], which by then had a similar format to their then-fraternal twin sister station WNBC, as well as WABC. That fall, Jay Clark took over as program director at WABC. Jeff Mazzei arrived as assistant program director from crosstown WNEW (which was moving from adult contemporary to big bands and standards).\n\nUnder Clark, the station played current music leaning toward a more Adult Contemporary sound, trying to appeal to a slightly older audience, as most younger listeners had moved to the FM dial. Part of the reason was the Top 40 chart was leaning that way at that point as well. So WABC still played rock and soul crossovers in moderation, but began to move away from album cuts and more toward 1960s and 1970s oldies. In September 1980, they also dropped the \"Musicradio WABC\" slogan and became \"77 WABC, New York's Radio Station\" (though they called themselves New York's radio station at times as Musicradio), the apparent implication being that the station was more than just music.\n\nBy early 1981, WABC's cumulative audience was down to 2.5 million\u2014rival WNBC, a perennial also-ran, was by this time beating them with 3 million. Fewer people were tuning into WABC, listeners who had switched to FM were not coming back, and, while still moderately successful, the ship was sinking. Like Al Brady Law, Jay Clark tried to improve the time-spent-listening. In March 1981, Bob Cruz departed, Dan Ingram went back to his familiar afternoon slot, and the team of Ross Brittain and Brian Wilson from [[Atlanta]] moved into morning drive. ''Ross and Wilson'', as the show was known, was very information-oriented, playing exactly four songs in an hour except on Saturdays when they played the usual 12 or so songs an hour. A week later, the station also began airing a weeknight sports-talk show with [[Art Rust, Jr.]] from 7 to 9 pm. WABC's ratings by this point were mediocre and they were still going down.\n\nAlso, that March, WABC became the full-time flagship radio outlet for Yankees baseball games, a distinction the station carried through the end of the 2001 season. This would be the longest continuous relationship the team would have with any flagship station (to date). Jay Clark reasoned that Yankee baseball would bring back some listeners to the station and that they would recycle back into the music format, but not even the \"Bronx Bombers\" could save music on WABC.\n\nIn the fall of 1981, WABC dropped the remaining heavy-rock cuts and non-crossover urban hits. They began playing more oldies, as well as songs from the adult contemporary chart, and added an \"advice\" talk show with Dr. Judy Kuriansky from 9&nbsp;pm to midnight on weeknights. Howard Hoffman and Sturgis Griffin exited at this point. By then, WABC was almost unrecognizable as a Top 40 station, the ratings were languishing, and rumors, which began as far back as 1979 were rampant that the station would be changing its format to talk and news sooner or later. By early 1982 it looked sooner than later. The management at ABC denied the rumors but did state that plans were to modify WABC into a Full Service AC format with music by day and talk evenings and overnights like [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] [[Pittsburgh]] was doing. Once a week beginning in February, WABC was auditioning prospective talk shows for the Midnight to 2 a.m. time slot.\n\nIn February 1982, WABC officially confirmed it would be going to an all-talk format that May. They stated that there would be ample notice before the switch happens. At that point the once a week overnight auditions for talk shows ended and WABC continued playing music overnights until the switch. The airstaff began saying goodbye with a comment here and there from February into May. Finally, on April 30, it was announced that the switch to all-talk would occur on May 10 at noon. From May 7 to 9, the departing station air-staffers said their goodbyes one last time. The official music format ended 10:45&nbsp;p.m. May 9, 1982. The station aired the Yankee game that day at [[Seattle Mariners|Seattle]]. From 2 a.m. to 5:30&nbsp;a.m. they ran the normal Sunday evening public affairs programs preempted due to the Yankee game. Ross & Wilson played their usual 4 songs and the music ended with a tribute show from 9 a.m. to noon May 10 hosted by Ron Lundy & Dan Ingram. Staffers that departed included Ron Lundy, Dan Ingram, Marc Sommers and Peter Bush. Assistant Program Director Jeff Mazzei left for a similar position at WCBS-FM where he would stay for well over 25 years. Marc Sommers also went to WCBS-FM and eventually Ron Lundy and Dan Ingram would join him there. Johnny Donovan and Mike McKay remained at WABC as staff announcers and producers. Mike McKay left WABC in 1984 for [[RKO Radio Network]] and Johnny Donovan stayed at WABC until his retirement in 2015.\n\nMonday, May 10, 1982, the day WABC stopped playing music, is sometimes called{{By whom|date=March 2011}} \"[[The Day the Music Died]]\". WABC ended its 22-year run as a music station with a 9&nbsp;am\u2013noon farewell show hosted by Dan Ingram and Ron Lundy. The last song played on WABC before the format change was \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\" by [[John Lennon]], followed by the familiar WABC \"Chime Time\" jingle, then a few seconds of silence followed by a minute jingle for talk radio before the debut of the new talk format.\n\n===The NewsTalkRadio 77 era (1982-current)===\n====Early years and success====\n\nInitially after the format change, the station ran satellite talk shows from corporate ABC's \"Talk Radio\" network. Initially, WABC's lineup consisted of Ross and Wilson until 10&nbsp;am, Owen Spann from Satellite until noon, Art Athens and News until 1&nbsp;pm, Money Management talk until 2&nbsp;pm, [[Michael Jackson (radio commentator)|Michael Jackson]] (a talk show host and not [[Michael Jackson|the late pop star]]) from satellite until 4&nbsp;pm, another advice show with Dr. Toni Grant from satellite until 6&nbsp;pm, and ending with a half-hour of news at 6. Sports Talk began at 6:30&nbsp;pm and remained on until 9 pm. Doctor Judy remained in her time slot. Overnights were hosted by [[Alan Colmes]], who played some music initially, but he stopped playing it by mid-1983. At that time, he was less politically based and more entertainment-based. Weekends had Child Psychology advice shows (Dr. Lawrance Balter), Home and Garden shows, talk about religion (Religion on the Line), and of course, the Yankees.\n\nRoss and Wilson stayed on and continued to play 4 songs per hour (mostly 1960s and 1970s hits but also some currents) throughout 1982. In 1983, they stopped playing music as well. Ross and Wilson split up in 1983 when Ross went over to [[WHTZ]]. While the station's final ratings as a music station were mediocre, their talk ratings initially were even lower. Jay Clark was terminated and replaced with then Assist. PD, Mark Mason.\n\nStill, the station stuck with the new format. After Brian Wilson left in 1984, Alan Colmes moved to mornings. Mark Mason left for a similar post at All-News WINS. He was replaced by John Mainelli and at that point they dropped satellite programming. They added more issues-oriented talk shows, with an increasing number of conservative talk show hosts, although several liberals, including Colmes and Lynn Samuels, also hosted shows. The ratings grew and by the late 1980s, they were a very successful talk station.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1996 WABC broadcast the popular [[Bob Grant (radio host)|Bob Grant]], a controversial, early \"right-wing\" talk radio host. After years of what many considered inflammatory remarks, he was fired in 1996 for a controversial comment regarding the death of United States Secretary of Commerce [[Ron Brown (U.S. politician)|Ron Brown]]. After a number of years at competitor station WOR, Grant returned as a host as of July 2007, was removed again in December 2008, and returned again as a weekend host in September 2009. Alan Colmes would leave in 1985 and by 1987 he emerged at WNBC on overnights, where he played moderate amounts of music there. He would move to afternoons on WNBC and eventually drop music there as well. He was on the air at WNBC's sign off in 1988. Colmes eventually returned to WABC.\n\nWithin its first years, the revamped WABC brought in [[Rush Limbaugh]], who would go on to be the anchor program of the local station for two decades, and soon after the giant of talk syndication, the model for countless other conservative radio shows to follow. In the early 1990s [[Phil Boyce]] took over as program director.\n\nOn Saturday September 8, 2001, John Batchelor presented a four-hour program on the attack on the USS ''Cole,'' identifying Osama bin Laden as the probable perpetrator.  On September 12, Batchelor was invited to broadcast on WABC \u201cuntil bin Laden is captured.\u201d The day bin Laden was caught, Batchelor and his executive producer were in Cracow; they continued on air and, with a hiatus in 2006, have been on air ever since, covering national and international security.\n\nIn 2004, the station earned the distinction of being a news/talk radio station even longer than it had been a Top 40 station, by marking 22 years in its present format.\n\n====Under Citadel and Cumulus====\n[[File:77 WABC word logo 2000s.png|left|thumb|77 WABC logo prior to 2011]]\nOn February 6, 2006, the Walt Disney Company announced that it would sell WABC and other radio properties not affiliated with either [[Radio Disney]] or [[ESPN Radio]], along with ABC Radio's [[ABC News & Talk|News & Talk]] and FM networks, to [[Citadel Broadcasting Corporation]] for $2.7 billion.  The transaction became final on June 12, 2007. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.<ref name=abj-citadelcumulus>{{cite news|title=Cumulus now owns Citadel Broadcasting|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2011/09/16/cumulus-now-owns-citadel-broadcasting.html|accessdate=September 16, 2011|newspaper=Atlanta Business Journal|date=September 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2007, Don Imus moved his program ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'' to WABC after 19 years at WFAN. Imus was fired from WFAN in April for controversial comments about Rutgers University's women's basketball team. [[Connell McShane]] (who had replaced [[Charles McCord]] following his retirement on May 5, 2011) served as sidekick and newscaster for the program, which was also simulcast on the [[Fox Business Network]]. The Imus show aired for the final time on March 29, 2018.\n\n[[Geraldo Rivera]] became host of WABC's 10 a.m. to noon slot beginning January 3, 2012, replacing Joe Crummey; he was replaced with [[Fox News Radio]]'s [[Brian Kilmeade]] in 2019.\n\nOn January 1, 2013, the traffic reports on WABC switched from Clear Channel's Total Traffic to Radiate Media's Right Now Traffic.\n\nLimbaugh and Hannity departed WABC at the end of 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/rush-hannity-leaving-cumulus-wor-article-1.1411314|title=Rush Limbaugh rushing out of Cumulus Media to WOR, with Sean Hannity in tow|work=[[New York Daily News]]|last=Hinckley|first=David|date=July 28, 2013|accessdate=July 29, 2017}}</ref> To fill Limbaugh's spot, WABC revived ''Curtis and Kuby''; [[Curtis Sliwa]] had been hosting the morning show at [[WNYM]] since his departure from WABC while [[Ron Kuby]] had for the most part been a commentator on various news shows since his show on [[Air America Radio]] was cancelled.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/02/business/media/talk-radio-on-wabc-shifts-focus-to-the-local.html?_r=0/|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Ben|last=Sisario|title=Talk Radio on WABC Shifts Focus to the Local|date=January 2, 2014}}</ref> Kuby was laid off in 2017; Sliwa would subsequently be paired on-air with [[Rita Cosby]], followed by current co-host [[Juliet Huddy]].\n\n====Acquisition by Red Apple Media====\n\nOn June 27, 2019, Red Apple Media, which is owned by [[John Catsimatidis]], bought WABC from Cumulus Media for $12.5 million in cash.<ref name=nypost-catsimatidis /> The sale closed on March 2, 2020.<ref name=amny02032020/> Catsimatidis plans no changes at the station; he also hosts a regionally syndicated Sunday morning talk show currently based at competing station [[WNYM]].\n\n==Previous programs==\nMany talk show hosts on WABC have moved on to national syndication; WABC was where the nationally syndicated programs hosted by [[Rush Limbaugh]] and [[Sean Hannity]] got their start, although those programs are now heard on WABC's talk radio rival in New York, [[WOR (AM)|WOR]]. The station also served as the flagship for ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'' with [[Don Imus]] from 2007 to 2018.\n\nFlagship-wise, Limbaugh's show was produced at WABC from 1988 until the early 2000s, when he started doing the program from [[Premiere Radio Networks]] and a studio in his home in [[South Florida]]. (Even then, until WABC dropped the program, substitute hosts for Limbaugh still used the WABC studios, and Limbaugh on occasion had hosted from WABC.) ''Imus in the Morning'' had also originated from WABC, while Levin originates from Washington, D.C. sister station [[WMAL-FM]]. The latter two shows are now syndicated by [[Westwood One (current)|Westwood One]], the successor to the original \"ABC Radio Network\" (known as [[Citadel Media]] from 2009 until 2011, and as [[Cumulus Media Networks]] from 2011 until 2014).\n\nSome of the station's former locally based hosts include [[John R. Gambling]], [[Jay Diamond]], [[Ed Koch]], [[Lynn Samuels]], [[Joy Behar]], [[Mario Cuomo]], [[Steve Malzberg]], [[Richard Bey]], [[Lionel (radio personality)|Lionel]], Harley Carnes, [[Dick Oliver]], [[Penny Crone]], [[Sam Donaldson]], [[Jerry Agar]], [[Michael Kay (sports broadcaster)|Michael Kay]], [[James Golden (radio personality)|James Golden]] (in partnership with Joel Santisteban), [[Brian Whitman]] and [[Mancow Muller]]. Several nationally syndicated talkers have included [[Howard Cosell]], [[Ed Hardy]], [[Tom Snyder]], [[Art Bell]], [[Mike Gallagher (political commentator)|Mike Gallagher]] (first heard locally co-hosting with Penny Crone, later in a syndicated show), [[Laura Schlessinger]], [[Matt Drudge]] and [[Laura Ingraham]]. Long time WABC (AM) newsman [[George Weber (radio personality)|George Weber]], who reported the events on 9/11 for the station, was murdered in 2009. WABC also carried [[Paul Harvey]]'s newscasts during ''Imus in the Morning'' (''Paul Harvey News and Comment'') and in-between the midday host and Limbaugh (''The Rest of the Story'') up through Harvey's death in 2009.\n\nAlthough the station had good ratings, it underperformed in terms of total revenue, an example being WABC billing $21.3 million in 2008,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/04/13/2009-04-13_for_ads_wltws_at_the_top_of_the_bill.html|location=New York|work=[[New York Daily News]]|title=On the radio: For ads, WLTW's at the top of the bill|first=David|last=Hinckley|date=April 12, 2009}}</ref> not even close to industry giant [[KFI (AM)|KFI]] in Los Angeles at $54.4 million.\n\nPhil Boyce departed as program director in October 2008, eventually replaced in February 2009 by former [[XM Satellite Radio]] programmer Laurie Cantillo. Laurie Cantillo resigned on October 31, 2011. Chuck Armstrong was named interim program director in November 2011. Craig Schwalb was named Program Director in January 2014.\n\n==Current programming==\n===Weekdays===\nThe station features a lineup of [[conservative talk]] shows. WABC personalities [[Bernard McGuirk]] and [[Sid Rosenberg]] host the weekday morning show, followed by ''[[Brian Killmeade|The Brian Killmeade Show]]'', produced by [[Fox News Talk]] and syndicated via [[Westwood One (current)|Westwood One]]. WABC personalities [[Curtis Sliwa]] and [[Juliet Huddy]] co-host an early afternoon show, followed by ''[[The Ben Shapiro Show]]'' in the late afternoon, ''[[The Mark Levin Show]]'' in early evenings, ''[[The John Batchelor Show]]'' in late evenings and ''[[Red Eye Radio]]'' in the overnight hours, all of which via Westwood One. Both local talk shows on WABC have been ranked among ''[[Talkers Magazine]]'' \"Heavy Hundred\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkers.com/2019-talkers-heavy-hundred-1-25/ |title=2019 TALKERS Heavy Hundred (#23 - ''Bernie & Sid'') |publisher=Talkers.Com |accessdate=2019-06-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkers.com/2019-talkers-heavy-hundred-26-50/ |title=2019 TALKERS Heavy Hundred (#36 - ''Curtis & Juliet'') |publisher=Talkers.Com |accessdate=2019-06-29 }}</ref>\n\n===Sports programming===\nWABC currently carries no sports programming. The station's most recent sports contract, with the [[United States Military Academy]] for [[Army Black Knights football|Army football]] games, expired at the end of the [[2015 Army Black Knights football team|2015 season]]. In addition to the aforementioned Yankees coverage, the station served two separate stints as the flagship for the [[New York Jets]] and was also the home of the [[New Jersey Devils]] beginning in 1988. WABC also previously carried [[Seton Hall University]] [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|men's basketball]].\n\nEarly in its Top 40 incarnation, WABC served as the original radio flagship of the [[New York Mets]] upon their establishment in 1962. A notable aspect of WABC's Mets coverage was [[Howard Cosell]] and former [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] pitcher [[Ralph Branca]] handling the pre- and post-game shows. The station lost those rights to [[WEPN (AM)|WHN]] following the 1963 season.\n\nThe Jets first called WABC home in the 1980s, but left toward the end of the decade for WCBS. The team would return to the station in 2000 after spending the previous seven seasons on [[WFAN]]. After then-sister station [[WEPN (AM)|WEPN]] became the Jets' flagship, WABC began simulcasting the games over their airwaves due to its stronger signal. The arrangement ended in 2008 as WEPN began simulcasting all its programming on two other stations.\n\nIn December 2001, broadcast rights to the Yankees were lost after 21 years to WCBS. WABC also lost the radio rights to the Devils in 2005, as New Jersey's hockey team moved to WFAN to substitute for the station's loss of the [[New York Rangers]] to WEPN. WABC served as an overflow station for the Rangers from 2005 through 2009, and also served the same purpose for the [[New York Knicks]] when their games moved from WFAN to WEPN, but those rights moved to [[WNYM]] in 2009. The loss of evening sports programming has forced WABC to attempt to solidify its evening talk lineup.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official|https://www.wabcradio.com}}\n*{{FCC letter|letterid=46284|hcards=yes|callsign=WABC}}{{AM station data|WABC}}\n* [http://www.wabccountry.com/ WABC Country (For WABC branded stream of country music)]\n* [http://www.musicradio77.com/ Musicradio 77 WABC (1960 to 1982) tribute site]\n* [http://www.nyradionews.com/wabc/ WABC News Historical Profile & Interviews (1978)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071211212303/http://wabctribute.com/ WABC Tribute Slideshow Movie]\n* [http://www.pophistorynow.com/samples.htm The 1960s Week-By-Week featuring in-depth news of the WMCA-WINS-WABC top-40 wars including ratings]\n* [https://archive.is/20130201051544/http://www.radio-history.com/nj2/piratejim/nycamhistory2.html Radio-History.com information on WJZ-AM]\n\n{{New York Radio}}\n{{News/Talk Radio Stations in New York}}\n{{Cumulus Media}}\n{{Clear Channel AM}}\n{{New York Mets broadcasters}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in New York City|ABC]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1921]]\n[[Category:Westinghouse Broadcasting]]\n[[Category:News and talk radio stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Cumulus Media radio stations]]\n[[Category:1921 establishments in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:New Jersey Devils broadcasters]]\n[[Category:New York Jets broadcasters]]\n[[Category:New York Yankees broadcasters]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toRonald Brown(link changed toRon Brown) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WABC_(AM)"}

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production has not seen a large reduction, but prices may increase according to industry representatives. Empty food shelves were only encountered temporarily, even in Wuhan city, while Chinese government officials released pork reserves to assure sufficient nourishment of the population.

physical distancing) includes [[infection control]] actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals. Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.<ref name=\"hwlyS\" /><ref name=\"Jr48s\" /> Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.<ref name=\"vczEM\" /><ref name=\"eI8fE\" /> The maximum gathering size recommended by government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.<ref name=\"fihKg\" /> On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.<ref name=\"Xj0e8\" />\n\nOlder adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, [[hypertension]], and [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune systems]] face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.<ref name=\"ruiZf\" /><ref name=\"sKc4Q\" />\n\nIn late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term \"social distancing\" with \"physical distancing\", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either [[telecommunication|virtually]] or at a distance. The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete [[social isolation]], rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.<ref name=\"9tsr9\" /><ref name=\"B2DkM\" /><ref name=\"KTIr0\" />\n\nSome authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production has not seen a large reduction, but prices may increase according to industry representatives. Empty food shelves were only encountered temporarily, even in Wuhan city, while Chinese government officials released pork reserves to assure sufficient nourishment of the population.

In the United States, it was used on the television program ''You Are There'' in its later years during the show's closing credits. [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer|Emerson, Lake and Palmer]]'s arrangement of \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" was the opening theme song for the ''[[CBS Sports Spectacular]]'' and in  Mexico, it was the main title theme of [[TV Azteca]] TV sport program ''DeporTV''. In Scotland, the BBC used it as the theme to their main news program ''[[Reporting Scotland]]'' in the late 1970s and early 1980s. An early 1980s Canadian television series called ''Titans'' used \"Fanfare\" as its opening theme music.\n\nIn Australia, the [[Seven Network]] used Emerson, Lake & Palmer's version in the 1980s and early 1990s as the theme music for ''[[Seven Sport]]'' broadcasts, and continued to use a teaser version up until 2011. In the early 1980s when Channel 0/28 (now [[SBS One]]) would begin transmission for the night, they would use the Aaron Copland version as their opening theme. It was also used as the opening theme for the network's very first night of transmission.\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Channel 3, the English language television channel operated by oil company [[Saudi Aramco]] in [[Dhahran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], used the fanfare as their opening and closing theme. The channel broadcast American and British television shows and films. Parts of the fanfare and its entirety was utilized in the United States American Broadcasting Systems (ABC) movie  ''The Day After\" shown in 1983. The film focused on the possibility of a nuclear war on the middle of American in Lawrence, KS.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Nine Network televised a lifestyle program call ''World of Boats'' (later to be broadened and called ''World of Leisure'') hosted by Chris Conroy which used the Emerson, Lake and Palmer version as the theme for the program.\n\nAt the 1988 University of Washington Computer Fair, Steve Jobs demoed the NeXT computer. The system used a recording of the music to show off the multi-media capabilities of the machine.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the piece was used as background music in [[United States Navy]] recruitment advertisements.\n\nThe [[Chicago Blackhawks]] of the [[NHL]] have used it as part of a pre-game video introduction of the team before it takes to the ice since moving into the [[United Center]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emM1-kzM0w |title=Chicago Blackhawks 2007-2008 Intro |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-04-05 |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>\n\nThis piece was used as the postlude at the funeral for [[Ron Brown|Ronald Brown]], [[Bill Clinton]]'s Commerce Secretary, on April 10, 1996, at the [[National Cathedral]].\n\nOn November 19, 2008, it was played as the wake-up music for the shuttle crew [[STS-126]] for mission pilot [[Eric A.

It was also played on July 20, 2011, as the wake-up music for the crew of [[STS-135]] - the final [[Space Shuttle]] mission - for mission commander [[Christopher Ferguson]].\n\nOn January 18, 2009, it was played at the beginning of [[We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial]]. It was also played at the beginning of \"An American Reunion\", the concert (also at the Lincoln Memorial) on the Saturday prior to the inauguration of Bill Clinton in 1992.\n\nSeveral feature films employ the piece for dramatic effect. [[John Williams]]' main themes for the 1978 ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' film are partially based on the fanfare and his original score for ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' draws heavily on its soundworld (though Copland's piece is not actually heard in either movie). The fanfare functioned as Jimmy King's theme in ''[[Ready to Rumble]]''. The [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Parinda]]'' prominently features the piece as background score, including in a haunting opening depicting shots of Bombay.<ref>Parinda part 1 (with the intro and the Copland piece in the background score) on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVMBtcYWKYc</ref>\n\nOn October 9, 2004, it was played as Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and her procession entered the debating chamber during the opening ceremony of the new [[Scottish Parliament building]] in [[Edinburgh]].\n\nThe first three notes of the piece are coincidentally the same as the sound made by the motors and door chimes of the [[MR-73]] class of cars on the [[Montreal Metro]] as they leave the station and accelerate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://observatory.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=7487 |title=Fanfare for the Common Commuter: Observatory: Design Observer |publisher=Observatory.designobserver.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" was one of the musical themes for [[Expo 67]], which was held in Montreal.\n\nOn September 21, 2012, \"Fanfare\" was played at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] as the [[Space Shuttle Endeavour]] touched down after its final flight.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/09/shuttle-endeavour-welcomed-star-treks-uhura.html |title=Shuttle Endeavour welcomed home by 'Star Trek's' Uhura at LAX |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2012-09-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, \u201cFanfare for the Common Man\u201d was used as the opener for the [[Carolina Crown Drum and Bugle Corps]] 2012 program \u201cFor the Common Good\u201d.

In the United States, it was used on the television program ''You Are There'' in its later years during the show's closing credits. [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer|Emerson, Lake and Palmer]]'s arrangement of \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" was the opening theme song for the ''[[CBS Sports Spectacular]]'' and in  Mexico, it was the main title theme of [[TV Azteca]] TV sport program ''DeporTV''. In Scotland, the BBC used it as the theme to their main news program ''[[Reporting Scotland]]'' in the late 1970s and early 1980s. An early 1980s Canadian television series called ''Titans'' used \"Fanfare\" as its opening theme music.\n\nIn Australia, the [[Seven Network]] used Emerson, Lake & Palmer's version in the 1980s and early 1990s as the theme music for ''[[Seven Sport]]'' broadcasts, and continued to use a teaser version up until 2011. In the early 1980s when Channel 0/28 (now [[SBS One]]) would begin transmission for the night, they would use the Aaron Copland version as their opening theme. It was also used as the opening theme for the network's very first night of transmission.\n\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Channel 3, the English language television channel operated by oil company [[Saudi Aramco]] in [[Dhahran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], used the fanfare as their opening and closing theme. The channel broadcast American and British television shows and films. Parts of the fanfare and its entirety was utilized in the United States American Broadcasting Systems (ABC) movie  ''The Day After\" shown in 1983. The film focused on the possibility of a nuclear war on the middle of American in Lawrence, KS.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Nine Network televised a lifestyle program call ''World of Boats'' (later to be broadened and called ''World of Leisure'') hosted by Chris Conroy which used the Emerson, Lake and Palmer version as the theme for the program.\n\nAt the 1988 University of Washington Computer Fair, Steve Jobs demoed the NeXT computer. The system used a recording of the music to show off the multi-media capabilities of the machine.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the piece was used as background music in [[United States Navy]] recruitment advertisements.\n\nThe [[Chicago Blackhawks]] of the [[NHL]] have used it as part of a pre-game video introduction of the team before it takes to the ice since moving into the [[United Center]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4emM1-kzM0w |title=Chicago Blackhawks 2007-2008 Intro |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-04-05 |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>\n\nThis piece was used as the postlude at the funeral for [[Ron Brown (U.S. politician)|Ronald Brown]], [[Bill Clinton]]'s Commerce Secretary, on April 10, 1996, at the [[National Cathedral]].\n\nOn November 19, 2008, it was played as the wake-up music for the shuttle crew [[STS-126]] for mission pilot [[Eric A.

[[John Williams]]' main themes for the 1978 ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' film are partially based on the fanfare and his original score for ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' draws heavily on its soundworld (though Copland's piece is not actually heard in either movie). The fanfare functioned as Jimmy King's theme in ''[[Ready to Rumble]]''. The [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Parinda]]'' prominently features the piece as background score, including in a haunting opening depicting shots of Bombay.<ref>Parinda part 1 (with the intro and the Copland piece in the background score) on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVMBtcYWKYc</ref>\n\nOn October 9, 2004, it was played as Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and her procession entered the debating chamber during the opening ceremony of the new [[Scottish Parliament building]] in [[Edinburgh]].\n\nThe first three notes of the piece are coincidentally the same as the sound made by the motors and door chimes of the [[MR-73]] class of cars on the [[Montreal Metro]] as they leave the station and accelerate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://observatory.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=7487 |title=Fanfare for the Common Commuter: Observatory: Design Observer |publisher=Observatory.designobserver.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> \"Fanfare for the Common Man\" was one of the musical themes for [[Expo 67]], which was held in Montreal.\n\nOn September 21, 2012, \"Fanfare\" was played at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] as the [[Space Shuttle Endeavour]] touched down after its final flight.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/09/shuttle-endeavour-welcomed-star-treks-uhura.html |title=Shuttle Endeavour welcomed home by 'Star Trek's' Uhura at LAX |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2012-09-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, \u201cFanfare for the Common Man\u201d was used as the opener for the [[Carolina Crown Drum and Bugle Corps]] 2012 program \u201cFor the Common Good\u201d.

Each day, the genies grant Leah three wishes, but they often make mistakes. Each episode features Leah working together with the genies to resolve the problems they unintentionally cause, all while keeping Shimmer and Shine a secret from her next door neighbor and best friend Zac.\n\nIn the second season, the characters are transported to Zahramay Falls, a magical land where Shimmer and Shine live. Leah reveals her genies' existence to Zac, who is given a genie of his own, named Kaz. Shimmer and Shine continue to grant Leah wishes in Zahramay Falls and befriend the sovereign of the land, Princess Samira. The season includes Samira's pet peacock, Roya and Leah's pet fox, Parisa. Also, Zeta, a villainous sorceress, and finally, Zeta's dragon, Nazboo.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Shimmer and Shine episodes}}\n{{:List of Shimmer and Shine episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Humans and genies===\n*Shimmer (voiced by [[Eva Bella]] in US, and [[Mia Wiltshire]] in UK) \u2013 An optimistic genie with blue eyes and pink hair. She is enthusiastic and encouraging. She loves cleaning, glitter, and collecting genie bottles. Her pet is a [[gibbon monkey]] named Tala.\n*Shine (voiced by [[Isabella Cramp]] in US, [[Elie Simons]] and [[Mia Hope]] in UK) \u2013 A courageous genie with purple eyes and blue hair. She is an animal lover and is often hungry. Her pet is a [[Bengal tiger]] cub named Nahal. Due to her love of animals, she is very knowledgeable about the behaviors of magical creatures native to Zahramay Falls. Unlike her sister, she hates cleaning. A running gag involves Shine saying \"It's like I always say...\" only to humorously reveal that she has just made up whatever she says next.\n*Leah (voiced by [[Alina Foley]] in US, and [[Claudia Burns]] in UK) \u2013 A blonde girl with green eyes who owns a genie bottle necklace, which includes Shimmer and Shine.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Sweetest Thing |minutes=3 |series=Shimmer and Shine |quote=Boom Zahramay! Your best friends are on the way.}}</ref> Although Shimmer and Shine usually mess up her wishes, Leah is patient and forgiving with them. Originally, she was forced to keep her genies' existence a secret from her close friend Zac, but revealed her secret to him after being transported to Zahramay Falls. In the second season, Princess Samira grants Leah and Zac's wish to visit Zahramay Falls whenever they want. While visiting her genies in Zahramay Falls, Leah magically dons a genie disguise in order to blend in, as humans are normally not allowed in Zahramay Falls.\n*Zac (voiced by [[Blake Bertrand]] in the first two seasons, [[Justin Felbinger]], and later [[Ethan Jones]] in season three and onward in US, and [[Innis Robertson-Pinnel]] in UK) \u2013 Leah's neighbor with red hair and blue eyes, and best human friend. In the first season, he is oblivious to the fact that Leah has genies. Whenever something strange or unusual happens, he responds to it in a carefree manner. He also has a habit of telling humorous experiences he has had to Leah. In the second season, he learns that Leah has genies and gets a genie of his own named Kaz.\n*Princess Samira (voiced by [[Nikki SooHoo]] in US, and [[Cariad Lloyd]] in UK) \u2013 The ruler of Zahramay Falls with violet eyes and ice blue hair with darker blue tips, who is in charge of checking up on all the genies in training. She can grant wishes along with the younger genies. She occasionally rewards genies with magic Genie Gems that can have a variety of magical effects. She acts as Shimmer and Shine's mentor and teacher. Despite Zeta being her self-proclaimed rival, Samira likes Zeta and is willing to give her a second chance at becoming a genie-in-training, which in season three is revealed to be due to her past friendship with Zeta when they were both students under Empress Caliana and hopes that Zeta and her can one day become friends again.\n*Zeta the Sorceress (voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]] in US & UK) \u2013 A resident of Zahramay Falls with green eyes and purple hair, who is Princess Samira's rival and wishes to replace her as the most powerful person in Zahramay Falls. Zeta is a sorceress instead of a genie, as she has no desire to grant the wishes of others, relying on magic potions and magical items. Her plans are almost always thwarted by Shimmer, Shine, and Leah. However, her own arrogance and ignorance can cause her to foil her own schemes as well. Despite the trouble she causes, the girls and Zac don't hold it against her and generally try to be friendly towards her when not foiling her schemes. Though she tends to be antagonistic towards Leah and her genies, she can be civil towards them at times and even work with them such when she finds herself and/or Nazboo in danger usually when her schemes backfire, which usually results in them saving her. Before becoming a sorceress, she was a genie-in-training under Empress Caliana along with Samira, whom Zeta befriended when she was a new student, though later quit school due to her jealousy of Samira and decided to become a sorceress instead, though despite her current rivalry with Samira is shown to cherish their past friendship as she held onto a feather pen Samira gave her when they first met along with a picture of the two of them together when they were both still friends.\n*Kaz (voiced by [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]] in US, and [[Harrison Noble]] in UK) \u2013 A genie in training with blue eyes and magenta hair who becomes Zac's genie in the second season. In contrast to Zac's easy-going and adventurous personality, Kaz is more cautious and scared easily. Despite their contrasting personalities, Zac and Kaz work well together and can be brave when he has to be. His cautious nature also means he puts more thought into how he grants Zac's wishes. Like most genies in Zahramay Falls, he has his own magic carpet, though sometimes uses Zac's Super Zoom Flyer, a magic carpet wished up by Zac. Kaz has a pet Ziffilon named Zain, who summoned by one of Zac's wishes after he learned that Kaz always wanted a Ziffilon as a pet. Though he and Zac get along well, he occasionally becomes unenthusiastic when granting wishes for Zac he would prefer not too. He was initially afraid of Zac's dog Rocket due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though eventually overcame his fear after Zac and the girls reminded him of how other genies were initially scared of Zain before they got to know him.\n*Empress Caliana (voiced by [[Barbara Eden]]) \u2013 Princess Samira's famous, semi-retired mentor with purple eyes and blonde hair with pink tips. Caliana was the one who gave Samira her special necklace back when she was a little genie-in-training. Empress Caliana was a great explorer when she was a little girl and made many groundbreaking discoveries, such as finding the Caliana Caves. She is also old friends with Rohan, the normally shy crystalline golem that guards the caves. When Zeta and Samira were younger, Caliana taught genies-in-training at her school in Genie Hall, where Zeta was her top student. While praising Zeta's potion making skills, she tried to teach her to be more considerate of others and assigned Samira to sit next to Zeta when Samira was a new student which lead to Samira befriending Zeta, though Zeta eventually became jealous of Samira when she became the class's new top student, which eventually led Zeta to quit school and decide to become a Sorceress instead after her attempt to sabotage Samira backfired, though Caliana expressed hope to Samira that she would one day return. \n*Captain Zora (voiced by [[Kellie Pickler]] from the season two finale, [[Kate Higgins]] from season three and onward) \u2013 A pirate genie who is Shine's idol. She is absentminded at times and can be very clumsy and forgetful, especially when she is on an adventure. She owns a flying pirate ship that she sometimes accidentally docks in odd places.

She has a talent for playing the keyboard.\n*Rocket \u2013 Zac's pet beagle who appears in several episodes of the first season and reappears in the third season. He is a rambunctious dog with a tendency to drool and chew on things which often causes trouble, though is simply an overly playful pouch who means no real harm. He has encountered Shimmer, Shine, Tala, and Nahal at various times. The only pet native to Leah and Zac's world, he eventually is wished to Zahramay Falls by Zac though is mistakenly seen as a monster by genies like Kaz and animals native to genie world like Parisa and Zain who are unfamiliar with dogs at first due to dogs not being native to their world, with the exception of Shimmer, Shine, Tala, Nahal, and Samira. After helping Zac stop Zeta from stealing Samira's staff, Samira permits Rocket to accompany Zac when he visits Zahramay Falls. \n*Nazboo \u2013 Zeta's talking pet dragon, who caters to her every need and acts as Zeta's underling. He has teal scales, purple eyes, white horns, a white tummy, and blue toes. He is somewhat clumsy and often accidentally causes Zeta's schemes to backfire. He can also get easily distracted by food or anything that piques his interest. He also enjoys getting an occasional tummy rub from Zeta. Though he acts as Zeta's underling most of the time, he is friendly towards Leah, Zac, and their genies as well as their pets to the point he often greets them by saying \"''Hi, Friends!''\" even in the middle of one of Zeta's schemes. Unlike Zeta, he is generally more considerate of others and prefers to play fair in competitions though usually assists Zeta in cheating. In the third season, he is revealed to be from Manetikar, The Land of Dragons and befriended Zeta when she came to Manetikar to find a dragon for a pet. Feeling sorry for Zeta after her attempt to make one of the larger flying dragons her pet failed, he agreed to become her pet and went home with her to her lair in Zahramay Falls, where he has lived ever since. He has a sister and two brothers who resemble him in appearance and personality.\n*Roya \u2013 Princess Samira's pet peacock, who resides in her palace. Roya is the polar opposite of Shimmer and Shine's pets, as she would much rather show off her feathers or practice walking gracefully than play or dance. Unlike Samira, Roya has a strong dislike for Zeta and Nazboo, to the point of literally chasing them out of Samira's Palace on one occasion. Once a year, she sheds a special feather with the ability to repair any magical object. \n*Parisa \u2013 Leah's pet Zahramay fox who possesses the ability to camouflage herself, making her practically invisible, whenever she wants. she also has a talent for painting. Parisa is introduced midway through the second season. Like Kaz and Zain, she was initially scared of Rocket, due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though not to the same degree that Kaz and Zain were.\n*Zain \u2013 Kaz's pet Ziffilon (a griffin-like creature). Kaz had always wanted a pet Ziffilon before getting Zain, so Zac uses one of his wishes to wish up a Ziffilon for Kaz. Zain is by far the largest of the pets, as he is big enough for Kaz to ride on his back, though despite his size Zain gets scared easily even more so than Kaz. Like most Ziffilons his favorite food is Zlam Berries and is originally from Ziffilon Island. Though he gets along with the other pets, he is frightened by Rocket at first due to being unfamiliar with dogs though after Zac reminds Kaz and Zain how other genies were scared of Zain at first, he and Kaz manage to overcome their initial fear of Rocket. \n*Zoomicorns \u2013 Winged Unicorns native to Zahramay Falls and Rainbow Zahramay introduced in the second season. They are friendly and helpful creatures who occasionally aid the girls and allow them to ride them. There is also a game called Zoomicorn Toss, where players ride flying Zahramay Cloud Boards while trying to throw rings around a Zoomicorn's horn as it flies around, without the use of magic as using magic is considered unfair. The only known named Zoomicorn, is Gleam who lives in Rainbow Zahramay that is a friend of the Glitter Genie Afina whom the girls meet and befriend during one of their adventures in Rainbow Zahramay in the third season. \n*Scallywag \u2013 The magical pet of the Pirate Genie Captain Zora, who helps Zora remember things that she forgets such as names and the meaning of words and phrases used by pirates. Scallywag flies around by spinning her tail in helicopter like fashion. Her magic goes out of control when scared, causing random magic effects. \n*Nazboo's Family \u2013 Nazboo's three siblings Razboo, Kazboo, and Frank who are introduced in the third season. They are all small flightless dragons that resemble Nazboo in appearance and share his friendly, playful nature as well as his love of food and tummy rubs. Nazboo and his siblings tend to get into trouble when they are together, much to Zeta's frustration and annoyance. Nazboo's sister Razboo has purple scales and wears a dark pink bow on her head. His brother Kazboo has dark green scales and a purple mohawk, while his brother Frank has blue scales and wears a light pink bowtie. Like their brother, Razboo, Kazboo, and Frank all have purple eyes, blue toes, and white bellies and horns. While Kazboo and Razboo are capable of speech like Nazboo, Frank's vocabulary is apparently limited to saying his own name, which doesn't rhyme with his other siblings' names.\n*Gleam \u2013 A blue glitter Zoomicorn native Rainbow Zarahmay.\n*Lulu \u2013 Misha's pet Panda.\n*Zahrora, Zoomdust, and Zadazzle \u2013 three Zarahcorns.\n*Dahliza \u2013 Princess Adara's Zarahcorn.\n*Fuzzle Whuzzles \u2013 Little creatures in Rainbow Zarahmay.\n*Azah \u2013 Rubi's Zarahcorn.\n\n==Production==\n''Shimmer and Shine'' is based on an unreleased pilot that took six months to develop in 2013, with a reported completion date of September 2013.

Leah reveals her genies' existence to Zac, who is given a genie of his own, named Kaz. Shimmer and Shine continue to grant Leah wishes in Zahramay Falls and befriend the sovereign of the land, Princess Samira. The season includes Samira's pet peacock, Roya and Leah's pet fox, Parisa. Also, Zeta, a villainous sorceress, and finally, Zeta's dragon, Nazboo.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Shimmer and Shine episodes}}\n{{:List of Shimmer and Shine episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Humans and genies===\n*Shimmer (voiced by [[Eva Bella]] in US, and [[Mia Wiltshire]] in UK) \u2013 An optimistic genie with blue eyes and pink hair. She is enthusiastic and encouraging. She loves cleaning, glitter, and collecting genie bottles. Her pet is a [[gibbon monkey]] named Tala.\n*Shine (voiced by [[Isabella Cramp]] in US, [[Elie Simons]] and [[Mia Hope]] in UK) \u2013 A courageous genie with purple eyes and blue hair. She is an animal lover and is often hungry. Her pet is a [[Bengal tiger]] cub named Nahal. Due to her love of animals, she is very knowledgeable about the behaviors of magical creatures native to Zahramay Falls. Unlike her sister, she hates cleaning. A running gag involves Shine saying \"It's like I always say...\" only to humorously reveal that she has just made up whatever she says next.\n*Leah (voiced by [[Alina Foley]] in US, and [[Claudia Burns]] in UK) \u2013 A blonde girl with green eyes who owns a genie bottle necklace, which includes Shimmer and Shine.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Sweetest Thing |minutes=3 |series=Shimmer and Shine |quote=Boom Zahramay! Your best friends are on the way.}}</ref> Although Shimmer and Shine usually mess up her wishes, Leah is patient and forgiving with them. Originally, she was forced to keep her genies' existence a secret from her close friend Zac, but revealed her secret to him after being transported to Zahramay Falls. In the second season, Princess Samira grants Leah and Zac's wish to visit Zahramay Falls whenever they want. While visiting her genies in Zahramay Falls, Leah magically dons a genie disguise in order to blend in, as humans are normally not allowed in Zahramay Falls.\n*Zac (voiced by [[Blake Bertrand]] in the first two seasons, [[Justin Felbinger]], and later [[Ethan Jones]] in season three and onward in US, and [[Innis Robertson-Pinnel]] in UK) \u2013 Leah's neighbor with red hair and blue eyes, and best human friend. In the first season, he is oblivious to the fact that Leah has genies. Whenever something strange or unusual happens, he responds to it in a carefree manner. He also has a habit of telling humorous experiences he has had to Leah. In the second season, he learns that Leah has genies and gets a genie of his own named Kaz.\n*Princess Samira (voiced by [[Nikki SooHoo]] in US, and [[Cariad Lloyd]] in UK) \u2013 The ruler of Zahramay Falls with violet eyes and ice blue hair with darker blue tips, who is in charge of checking up on all the genies in training. She can grant wishes along with the younger genies. She occasionally rewards genies with magic Genie Gems that can have a variety of magical effects. She acts as Shimmer and Shine's mentor and teacher. Despite Zeta being her self-proclaimed rival, Samira likes Zeta and is willing to give her a second chance at becoming a genie-in-training, which in season three is revealed to be due to her past friendship with Zeta when they were both students under Empress Caliana and hopes that Zeta and her can one day become friends again.\n*Zeta the Sorceress (voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]] in US & UK) \u2013 A resident of Zahramay Falls with green eyes and purple hair, who is Princess Samira's rival and wishes to replace her as the most powerful person in Zahramay Falls. Zeta is a sorceress instead of a genie, as she has no desire to grant the wishes of others, relying on magic potions and magical items. Her plans are almost always thwarted by Shimmer, Shine, and Leah. However, her own arrogance and ignorance can cause her to foil her own schemes as well. Despite the trouble she causes, the girls and Zac don't hold it against her and generally try to be friendly towards her when not foiling her schemes. Though she tends to be antagonistic towards Leah and her genies, she can be civil towards them at times and even work with them such when she finds herself and/or Nazboo in danger usually when her schemes backfire, which usually results in them saving her. Before becoming a sorceress, she was a genie-in-training under Empress Caliana along with Samira, whom Zeta befriended when she was a new student, though later quit school due to her jealousy of Samira and decided to become a sorceress instead, though despite her current rivalry with Samira is shown to cherish their past friendship as she held onto a feather pen Samira gave her when they first met along with a picture of the two of them together when they were both still friends.\n*Kaz (voiced by [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]] in US, and [[Harrison Noble]] in UK) \u2013 A genie in training with blue eyes and magenta hair who becomes Zac's genie in the second season. In contrast to Zac's easy-going and adventurous personality, Kaz is more cautious and scared easily. Despite their contrasting personalities, Zac and Kaz work well together and can be brave when he has to be. His cautious nature also means he puts more thought into how he grants Zac's wishes. Like most genies in Zahramay Falls, he has his own magic carpet, though sometimes uses Zac's Super Zoom Flyer, a magic carpet wished up by Zac. Kaz has a pet Ziffilon named Zain, who summoned by one of Zac's wishes after he learned that Kaz always wanted a Ziffilon as a pet. Though he and Zac get along well, he occasionally becomes unenthusiastic when granting wishes for Zac he would prefer not too. He was initially afraid of Zac's dog Rocket due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though eventually overcame his fear after Zac and the girls reminded him of how other genies were initially scared of Zain before they got to know him.\n*Empress Caliana (voiced by [[Barbara Eden]]) \u2013 Princess Samira's famous, semi-retired mentor with purple eyes and blonde hair with pink tips. Caliana was the one who gave Samira her special necklace back when she was a little genie-in-training. Empress Caliana was a great explorer when she was a little girl and made many groundbreaking discoveries, such as finding the Caliana Caves. She is also old friends with Rohan, the normally shy crystalline golem that guards the caves. When Zeta and Samira were younger, Caliana taught genies-in-training at her school in Genie Hall, where Zeta was her top student. While praising Zeta's potion making skills, she tried to teach her to be more considerate of others and assigned Samira to sit next to Zeta when Samira was a new student which lead to Samira befriending Zeta, though Zeta eventually became jealous of Samira when she became the class's new top student, which eventually led Zeta to quit school and decide to become a Sorceress instead after her attempt to sabotage Samira backfired, though Caliana expressed hope to Samira that she would one day return. \n*Captain Zora (voiced by [[Kellie Pickler]] from the season two finale, [[Kate Higgins]] from season three and onward) \u2013 A pirate genie who is Shine's idol. She is absentminded at times and can be very clumsy and forgetful, especially when she is on an adventure. She owns a flying pirate ship that she sometimes accidentally docks in odd places. Shine loves pirate genies and Captain Zora is her favorite of them all, so she gets very nervous and sometimes cannot talk clearly when she is around Zora.\n*Layla (voiced by [[Danica McKellar]]) \u2013 An ice genie who is a good friend of Princess Samira. She possesses an ice gem necklace that gives her freezing powers and keeps her body cold. She originally lived in a genie bottle buried on a sandy beach in Zahramay Falls, but it was accidentally broken by Leah and her genies. She currently lives in an ice palace.\n*Shaya (voiced by [[Kin Santiago]] in Season 2 through 3 and [[Hudson West]]) \u2013 A lightning genie in training who rides around on a flying cloud-board and can generate magical lightning. Leah and her genies help him catch a run away magic lightning bolt he created while practicing his magic. Though he is reluctant to work with Leah and her genies at first, he eventually learns the value of teamwork from them.\n*Nila (voiced by [[Mila Brener]] in US, and [[Kimani Arthur]] in UK) \u2013 A mermaid who lives in the waters near Zahramay Falls. Leah and her genies befriend Nila after Leah wishes to find a Mermaid after learning they are real. She helps the girls obtain the Mermaid Gem to change the girls back to their non-mermaid selves after Leah accidentally uses up her wishes which leaves the girls trapped in Mermaid form. After Nila and the girls obtain the gem by befriending its lonely Guardian, she teaches them the spell to activate the gem's power which can both transform into Mermaids as well as undo the transformation allowing the girls to visit Nila and go on underwater adventures with her. \n*Imma  (voiced by [[Grace Kaufman]]) \u2013 The Waterfall Genie who oversees the source of the rainbow waterfalls of Zahramay Falls in Rainbow Zahramay. The girls befriend her after Samira sends them on their first adventure to Rainbow Zahramay to investigate the cause of a weird mist produced by the falls that disrupts magic in Zahramay Falls and help Imma resolve the problem. Imma can use water magic that allows her to manipulate water using her magic staff which she also uses to activate the locks that control the flow of rainbow water to the falls.\n* Wishy Washy Genie (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) \u2013 A male genie whose powerful magic is to remove or fix a wish that cannot be used on other genies.

She has a talent for playing the keyboard.\n*Rocket \u2013 Zac's pet beagle who appears in several episodes of the first season and reappears in the third season. He is a rambunctious dog with a tendency to drool and chew on things which often causes trouble, though is simply an overly playful pouch who means no real harm. He has encountered Shimmer, Shine, Tala, and Nahal at various times. The only pet native to Leah and Zac's world, he eventually is wished to Zahramay Falls by Zac though is mistakenly seen as a monster by genies like Kaz and animals native to genie world like Parisa and Zain who are unfamiliar with dogs at first due to dogs not being native to their world, with the exception of Shimmer, Shine, Tala, Nahal, and Samira. After helping Zac stop Zeta from stealing Samira's staff, Samira permits Rocket to accompany Zac when he visits Zahramay Falls. \n*Nazboo \u2013 Zeta's talking pet dragon, who caters to her every need and acts as Zeta's underling. He has teal scales, purple eyes, white horns, a white tummy, and blue toes. He is somewhat clumsy and often accidentally causes Zeta's schemes to backfire. He can also get easily distracted by food or anything that piques his interest. He also enjoys getting an occasional tummy rub from Zeta. Though he acts as Zeta's underling most of the time, he is friendly towards Leah, Zac, and their genies as well as their pets to the point he often greets them by saying \"''Hi, Friends!''\" even in the middle of one of Zeta's schemes. Unlike Zeta, he is generally more considerate of others and prefers to play fair in competitions though usually assists Zeta in cheating. In the third season, he is revealed to be from Manetikar, The Land of Dragons and befriended Zeta when she came to Manetikar to find a dragon for a pet. Feeling sorry for Zeta after her attempt to make one of the larger flying dragons her pet failed, he agreed to become her pet and went home with her to her lair in Zahramay Falls, where he has lived ever since. He has a sister and two brothers who resemble him in appearance and personality.\n*Roya \u2013 Princess Samira's pet peacock, who resides in her palace. Roya is the polar opposite of Shimmer and Shine's pets, as she would much rather show off her feathers or practice walking gracefully than play or dance. Unlike Samira, Roya has a strong dislike for Zeta and Nazboo, to the point of literally chasing them out of Samira's Palace on one occasion. Once a year, she sheds a special feather with the ability to repair any magical object. \n*Parisa \u2013 Leah's pet Zahramay fox who possesses the ability to camouflage herself, making her practically invisible, whenever she wants. she also has a talent for painting. Parisa is introduced midway through the second season. Like Kaz and Zain, she was initially scared of Rocket, due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though not to the same degree that Kaz and Zain were.\n*Zain \u2013 Kaz's pet Ziffilon (a griffin-like creature). Kaz had always wanted a pet Ziffilon before getting Zain, so Zac uses one of his wishes to wish up a Ziffilon for Kaz. Zain is by far the largest of the pets, as he is big enough for Kaz to ride on his back, though despite his size Zain gets scared easily even more so than Kaz. Like most Ziffilons his favorite food is Zlam Berries and is originally from Ziffilon Island. Though he gets along with the other pets, he is frightened by Rocket at first due to being unfamiliar with dogs though after Zac reminds Kaz and Zain how other genies were scared of Zain at first, he and Kaz manage to overcome their initial fear of Rocket. \n*Zoomicorns \u2013 Winged Unicorns native to Zahramay Falls and Rainbow Zahramay introduced in the second season. They are friendly and helpful creatures who occasionally aid the girls and allow them to ride them. There is also a game called Zoomicorn Toss, where players ride flying Zahramay Cloud Boards while trying to throw rings around a Zoomicorn's horn as it flies around, without the use of magic as using magic is considered unfair. The only known named Zoomicorn, is Gleam who lives in Rainbow Zahramay that is a friend of the Glitter Genie Afina whom the girls meet and befriend during one of their adventures in Rainbow Zahramay in the third season. \n*Scallywag \u2013 The magical pet of the Pirate Genie Captain Zora, who helps Zora remember things that she forgets such as names and the meaning of words and phrases used by pirates. Scallywag flies around by spinning her tail in helicopter like fashion. Her magic goes out of control when scared, causing random magic effects. \n*Nazboo's Family \u2013 Nazboo's three siblings Razboo, Kazboo, and Frank who are introduced in the third season. They are all small flightless dragons that resemble Nazboo in appearance and share his friendly, playful nature as well as his love of food and tummy rubs. Nazboo and his siblings tend to get into trouble when they are together, much to Zeta's frustration and annoyance. Nazboo's sister Razboo has purple scales and wears a dark pink bow on her head. His brother Kazboo has dark green scales and a purple mohawk, while his brother Frank has blue scales and wears a light pink bowtie.
