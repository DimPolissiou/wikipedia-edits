It is the challenge of constructing a [[square (geometry)|square]] with the same area as a given [[circle]] by using only a finite number of steps with [[compass and straightedge]]. The difficulty of the problem raised the question of whether specified [[axiom]]s of [[Euclidean geometry]] concerning the existence of lines and circles implied the existence of such a square.\n\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the [[Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem]] which proves that [[pi]] ({{pi}}) is a [[Transcendental number|transcendental]], rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the [[zero of a function|root]] of any [[polynomial]] with [[Rational number|rational]] coefficients. It had been known for decades that the construction would be impossible if {{pi}} were transcendental, but {{pi}} was not proven transcendental until 1882. Approximate squaring to any given non-perfect accuracy, in contrast, is possible in a finite number of steps, since there are rational numbers arbitrarily close to {{pi}}.\n\nThe expression \"squaring the circle\" is sometimes used as a metaphor for trying to do the impossible.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ammer|first=Christine|title=Square the Circle.

The Egyptian [[Rhind papyrus]] of 1800&nbsp;BC gives the area of a circle as {{sfrac|64|81}}&nbsp;{{math|''d''}}<sup>&nbsp;2</sup>, where {{math|''d''}} is the diameter of the circle. In modern terms, this is equivalent to approximating {{pi}} as {{sfrac|256|81}} (approximately 3.1605), a number that appears in the older [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] and is used for volume approximations (i.e. [[hekat (volume unit)|hekat]]). [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematicians]] also found an approximate method, though less accurate, documented in the ''[[Shulba Sutras]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|author1=O'Connor, John J.  |author2=Robertson, Edmund F.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2000|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Indian_sulbasutras.html|title=The Indian Sulbasutras|work=MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|publisher=St Andrews University}}</ref> [[Archimedes]] proved the formula for the area of a circle ({{math|1=''A'' = {{pi}}''r''<sup>2</sup>}}, where {{mvar|r}} is the radius of the circle) and showed that the value of {{pi}} lay between {{sfrac|3|1|7}} (approximately 3.1429) and {{sfrac|3|10|71}} (approximately 3.1408). See [[Numerical approximations of \u03c0|Numerical approximations of {{pi}}]] for more on the history.\n\nThe first known Greek to be associated with the problem was [[Anaxagoras]], who worked on it while in prison. [[Hippocrates of Chios]] squared certain [[Lune (mathematics)|lunes]], in the hope that it would lead to a solution \u2013 see [[Lune of Hippocrates]]. [[Antiphon the Sophist]] believed that inscribing regular polygons within a circle and doubling the number of sides will eventually fill up the area of the circle, and since a polygon can be squared, it means the circle can be squared. Even then there were skeptics\u2014[[Eudemus of Rhodes|Eudemus]] argued that magnitudes cannot be divided up without limit, so the area of the circle will never be used up.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Heath | first = Thomas | year = 1981 | title = History of Greek Mathematics | publisher = Courier Dover Publications| isbn = 0-486-24074-6}}</ref> The problem was even mentioned in [[Aristophanes]]'s play ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]''.\n\nIt is believed that [[Oenopides]] was the first Greek who required a plane solution (that is, using only a compass and straightedge).

In one of his diary entries for 1855, Dodgson listed books he hoped to write including one called \"Plain Facts for Circle-Squarers\". In the introduction to \"A New Theory of Parallels\", Dodgson recounted an attempt to demonstrate logical errors to a couple of circle-squarers, stating:<ref>{{Cite book\n|author=Martin Gardner\n|title=The Universe in a Handkerchief\n|isbn=0-387-94673-X\n|publisher=Springer\n|year=1996\n|url-access=registration\n|url=https://archive.org/details/universeinhandke0000gard\n}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The first of these two misguided visionaries filled me with a great ambition to do a feat I have never heard of as accomplished by man, namely to convince a circle squarer of his error!

More than a score of letters were interchanged before I became sadly convinced that I had no chance.\n</blockquote>\n\nA ridiculing of circle-squaring appears in [[Augustus de Morgan]]'s ''[[A Budget of Paradoxes]]'' published posthumously by his widow in 1872. Having originally published the work as a series of articles in the ''Athen\u00e6um'', he was revising it for publication at the time of his death. Circle squaring was very popular in the nineteenth century, but hardly anyone indulges in it today and it is believed that de Morgan's work helped bring this about.<ref>{{Cite book|first=Underwood|last=Dudley|title=A Budget of Trisections|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1987|isbn=0-387-96568-8|pages=xi\u2013xii|ref=harv}} Reprinted as ''The Trisectors''.</ref>\n\n==Impossibility==\nThe solution of the problem of squaring the circle by compass and straightedge requires the construction of the number {{sqrt|{{pi}}}}. If {{sqrt|{{pi}}}} is [[constructible number|constructible]], it follows from [[Straightedge and compass|standard constructions]] that {{pi}} would also be constructible.

If a rational number is used as an approximation of {{pi}}, then squaring the circle becomes possible, depending on the values chosen. However, this is only an approximation and does not meet the constraints of the ancient rules for solving the problem. Several mathematicians have demonstrated workable procedures based on a variety of approximations.\n\nBending the rules by allowing an infinite number of compass-and-straightedge operations or by performing the operations in certain [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] also makes squaring the circle possible in some sense. For example, although the circle cannot be squared in [[Euclidean space]], it sometimes can be in [[hyperbolic geometry]] under suitable interpretations of the terms.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF03024895   | last = Jagy  | first = William C. | title = Squaring circles in the hyperbolic plane | journal = Mathematical Intelligencer  | volume = 17  | issue = 2  | pages = 31\u201336  | year = 1995   | url = http://zakuski.math.utsa.edu/~jagy/papers/Intelligencer_1995.pdf | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Greenberg\n  | first = Marvin Jay\n  |authorlink= Marvin Greenberg\n  | title =  Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometries\n  | publisher = W H Freeman\n  | year = 2008\n  | pages = 520\u2013528\n  | edition = Fourth\n  | isbn =  0-7167-9948-0\n  | postscript = <!--None--> }}</ref> As there are no squares in the hyperbolic plane, their role needs to be taken by ''regular quadrilaterals'', meaning quadrilaterals with all sides congruent and all angles congruent (but these angles are strictly smaller than right angles).\nThere exist, in the hyperbolic plane, (countably) infinitely many pairs of constructible circles and constructible regular quadrilaterals of equal area, which, however, are constructed simultaneously.\nThere is no method for starting with a regular quadrilateral and constructing the circle of equal area, and there is no method for starting with a circle and constructing a regular quadrilateral of equal area (even when the circle has small enough radius such that a regular quadrilateral of equal area exists).\n\n== Modern approximative constructions == \nThough squaring the circle is an impossible problem using only compass and straightedge, approximations to squaring the circle can be given by constructing lengths close to&nbsp;{{pi}}.\nIt takes only minimal knowledge of elementary geometry to convert any given rational approximation of {{pi}} into a corresponding [[compass-and-straightedge construction]], but constructions made in this way tend to be very long-winded in comparison to the accuracy they achieve.

Since the techniques of calculus were unknown, it was generally presumed that a squaring should be done via geometric constructions, that is, by compass and straightedge.  For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] wrote to [[Henry Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] in 1676 \"I believe M. Leibnitz will not dislike the Theorem towards the beginning of my letter pag. 4 for '''squaring Curve lines''' Geometrically\" (emphasis added).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVPJ6c9_kKgC&pg=PA259|title=Correspondence of Sir Isaac Newton and Professor Cotes: Including letters of other eminent men|author1=Cotes|first1=Roger|year=1850}}</ref> After Newton and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] invented calculus, they still referred to this integration problem as squaring a curve.\n\n==Claims of circle squaring==\n===Connection with the longitude problem===\nThe mathematical proof that the [[numerical integration|quadrature]] of the circle is impossible using only compass and straightedge has not proved to be a hindrance to the many people who have invested years in this problem anyway.  Having squared the circle is a famous [[crank (person)|crank]] assertion. (''See also'' [[pseudomathematics]].) In his old age, the English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] convinced himself that he had succeeded in squaring the circle.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th century, the notion that the problem of squaring the circle was somehow related to the [[History of longitude#Problem of longitude|longitude problem]] seems to have become prevalent among would-be circle squarers. Using \"cyclometer\" for circle-squarer, [[Augustus de Morgan]] wrote in 1872:\n\n<blockquote>\n[[Jean Etienne Montucla|Montucla]] says, speaking of France, that he finds three notions prevalent among cyclometers: 1. That there is a large reward offered for success; 2. That the longitude problem depends on that success; 3. That the solution is the great end and object of geometry. The same three notions are equally prevalent among the same class in England. No reward has ever been offered by the government of either country.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Augustus de Morgan]] |year=1872|title=[[A Budget of Paradoxes]]|page= 96}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough from 1714 to 1828 the British government did indeed sponsor a \u00a320,000 prize for finding a solution to the longitude problem, exactly why the connection was made to squaring the circle is not clear; especially since two non-geometric methods (the astronomical [[Lunar distance (navigation)|method of lunar distances]] and the mechanical [[marine chronometer|chronometer]]) had been found by the late 1760s. De Morgan goes on to say that \"[t]he longitude problem in no way depends upon perfect solution; existing approximations are sufficient to a point of accuracy far beyond what can be wanted.\" In his book, de Morgan also mentions receiving many threatening letters from would-be circle squarers, accusing him of trying to \"cheat them out of their prize\".\n\n===Other modern claims===\nEven after it had been proved impossible, in 1894, amateur mathematician Edwin J. Goodwin claimed that he had developed a method to square the circle. The technique he developed did not accurately square the circle, and provided an incorrect area of the circle which essentially redefined pi as equal to 3.2. Goodwin then proposed the [[Indiana Pi Bill]] in the Indiana state legislature allowing the state to use his method in education without paying royalties to him. The bill passed with no objections in the state house, but the bill was tabled and never voted on in the Senate, amid increasing ridicule from the press.<ref>{{Citation|last=Numberphile|title=How Pi was nearly changed to 3.2 - Numberphile|date=12 March 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFNjA9LOPsg}}</ref>\n\nThe mathematical crank [[Carl Theodore Heisel]] also claimed to have squared the circle in his book, \"Behold! : the grand problem no longer unsolved: the circle squared beyond refutation.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Heisel |first1=Carl Theodore |title=Behold! : the grand problem the circle squared beyond refutation no longer unsolved |date=1934 |publisher=Heisel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uqe3swEACAAJ+|language=en}}</ref> [[Paul Halmos]] referred to the book as a \"classic crank book.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Halmos |first1=Paul |title=How to Write Mathematics |url=https://www.math.uh.edu/~tomforde/Books/Halmos-How-To-Write.pdf |accessdate=16 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1874, [[John A.

It is the challenge of constructing a [[square (geometry)|square]] with the same area as a given [[circle]] by using only a finite number of steps with [[compass and straightedge]]. The difficulty of the problem raised the question of whether specified [[axiom]]s of [[Euclidean geometry]] concerning the existence of lines and circles implied the existence of such a square.\n\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the [[Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem]] which proves that [[pi]] ({{pi}}) is a [[Transcendental number|transcendental]], rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the [[zero of a function|root]] of any [[polynomial]] with [[Rational number|rational]] coefficients. It had been known for decades that the construction would be impossible if {{pi}} were transcendental, but {{pi}} was not proven transcendental until 1882. Approximate squaring to any given non-perfect accuracy, in contrast, is possible in a finite number of steps, since there are rational numbers arbitrarily close to {{pi}}.\n\nThe expression \"squaring the circle\" is sometimes used as a metaphor for trying to do the impossible.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ammer|first=Christine|title=Square the Circle.

In modern terms, this is equivalent to approximating {{pi}} as {{sfrac|256|81}} (approximately 3.1605), a number that appears in the older [[Moscow Mathematical Papyrus]] and is used for volume approximations (i.e. [[hekat (volume unit)|hekat]]).

In the introduction to \"A New Theory of Parallels\", Dodgson recounted an attempt to demonstrate logical errors to a couple of circle-squarers, stating:<ref>{{Cite book\n|author=Martin Gardner\n|title=The Universe in a Handkerchief\n|isbn=0-387-94673-X\n|publisher=Springer\n|year=1996\n|url-access=registration\n|url=https://archive.org/details/universeinhandke0000gard\n}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The first of these two misguided visionaries filled me with a great ambition to do a feat I have never heard of as accomplished by man, namely to convince a circle squarer of his error!

Having originally published the work as a series of articles in the ''Athen\u00e6um'', he was revising it for publication at the time of his death.

If a rational number is used as an approximation of {{pi}}, then squaring the circle becomes possible, depending on the values chosen.

Several mathematicians have demonstrated workable procedures based on a variety of approximations.\n\nBending the rules by allowing an infinite number of compass-and-straightedge operations or by performing the operations in certain [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] also makes squaring the circle possible in some sense.

Since the techniques of calculus were unknown, it was generally presumed that a squaring should be done via geometric constructions, that is, by compass and straightedge.  For example, [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] wrote to [[Henry Oldenburg|Oldenburg]] in 1676 \"I believe M. Leibnitz will not dislike the Theorem towards the beginning of my letter pag. 4 for '''squaring Curve lines''' Geometrically\" (emphasis added).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVPJ6c9_kKgC&pg=PA259|title=Correspondence of Sir Isaac Newton and Professor Cotes: Including letters of other eminent men|author1=Cotes|first1=Roger|year=1850}}</ref> After Newton and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] invented calculus, they still referred to this integration problem as squaring a curve.\n\n==Claims of circle squaring==\n===Connection with the longitude problem===\nThe mathematical proof that the [[numerical integration|quadrature]] of the circle is impossible using only compass and straightedge has not proved to be a hindrance to the many people who have invested years in this problem anyway.  Having squared the circle is a famous [[crank (person)|crank]] assertion. (''See also'' [[pseudomathematics]].) In his old age, the English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] convinced himself that he had succeeded in squaring the circle.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th century, the notion that the problem of squaring the circle was somehow related to the [[History of longitude#Problem of longitude|longitude problem]] seems to have become prevalent among would-be circle squarers. Using \"cyclometer\" for circle-squarer, [[Augustus de Morgan]] wrote in 1872:\n\n<blockquote>\n[[Jean Etienne Montucla|Montucla]] says, speaking of France, that he finds three notions prevalent among cyclometers: 1. That there is a large reward offered for success; 2. That the longitude problem depends on that success; 3. That the solution is the great end and object of geometry. The same three notions are equally prevalent among the same class in England. No reward has ever been offered by the government of either country.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Augustus de Morgan]] |year=1872|title=[[A Budget of Paradoxes]]|page= 96}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough from 1714 to 1828 the British government did indeed sponsor a \u00a320,000 prize for finding a solution to the longitude problem, exactly why the connection was made to squaring the circle is not clear; especially since two non-geometric methods (the astronomical [[Lunar distance (navigation)|method of lunar distances]] and the mechanical [[marine chronometer|chronometer]]) had been found by the late 1760s. De Morgan goes on to say that \"[t]he longitude problem in no way depends upon perfect solution; existing approximations are sufficient to a point of accuracy far beyond what can be wanted.\" In his book, de Morgan also mentions receiving many threatening letters from would-be circle squarers, accusing him of trying to \"cheat them out of their prize\".\n\n===Other modern claims===\nEven after it had been proved impossible, in 1894, amateur mathematician Edwin J. Goodwin claimed that he had developed a method to square the circle. The technique he developed did not accurately square the circle, and provided an incorrect area of the circle which essentially redefined pi as equal to 3.2. Goodwin then proposed the [[Indiana Pi Bill]] in the Indiana state legislature allowing the state to use his method in education without paying royalties to him. The bill passed with no objections in the state house, but the bill was tabled and never voted on in the Senate, amid increasing ridicule from the press.<ref>{{Citation|last=Numberphile|title=How Pi was nearly changed to 3.2 - Numberphile|date=12 March 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFNjA9LOPsg}}</ref>\n\nThe mathematical crank [[Carl Theodore Heisel]] also claimed to have squared the circle in his book, \"Behold! : the grand problem no longer unsolved: the circle squared beyond refutation.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Heisel |first1=Carl Theodore |title=Behold! : the grand problem the circle squared beyond refutation no longer unsolved |date=1934 |publisher=Heisel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uqe3swEACAAJ+|language=en}}</ref> [[Paul Halmos]] referred to the book as a \"classic crank book.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Halmos |first1=Paul |title=How to Write Mathematics |url=https://www.math.uh.edu/~tomforde/Books/Halmos-How-To-Write.pdf |accessdate=16 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1874, [[John A.

Daniel was the business brain, while Alexander laid the literary foundations, publishing such notable authors as [[Charles Kingsley]] (1855), [[Thomas Hughes]] (1859), [[Francis Turner Palgrave]] (1861), [[Christina Rossetti]] (1862), [[Matthew Arnold]] (1865) and [[Lewis Carroll]] (1865). [[Alfred Tennyson]] joined the list in 1884, [[Thomas Hardy]] in 1886 and [[Rudyard Kipling]] in 1890.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.panmacmillan.com/about|title=About Pan Macmillan|publisher=Pan Macmillan UK|accessdate=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\nOther major writers published by Macmillan included [[W.

Snow]], [[Rumer Godden]] and [[Ram Sharan Sharma]].\n\nBeyond literature, the company created such enduring titles as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' (1869), the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' (1877) and [[Robert Harry Inglis Palgrave|Sir Robert Harry Inglis Palgrave]]'s ''Dictionary of Political Economy'' (1894\u201399).\n\n[[George Edward Brett]] opened the first Macmillan office in the United States in 1869 and Macmillan sold its U.S. operations to the Brett family, [[George Platt Brett, Sr.]] and [[George Platt Brett]], Jr. in 1896, resulting in the creation of an American company, [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishing]], also called the Macmillan Company. Even with the split of the American company from its parent company in England, George Brett, Jr. and Harold Macmillan remained close personal friends. Macmillan Publishers re-entered the American market in 1954 under the name [[St. Martin's Press]]. \n\n[[Macmillan of Canada]] was founded in 1905; [[Maclean-Hunter]] acquired the company in 1973.

On 13 February 1593 Lennox decided to play golf with [[James Sandilands (courtier)|Sir James Sandilands]] at Leith. On their way they met John Graham, a [[Court of Session|Lord of Session]], who thought Sandilands was attacking him. The two groups of attendants fired on each other with pistols and John Graham and Sir Alexander Stewart, a companion of the duke, were killed.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 49.</ref>\n\nOn 6 May 1593 the Duke and 15 friends subscribed to a frivolous legal document swearing to abstain from wearing gold and silver trimmings on their clothes for a year, and defaulters were to pay for a banquet for all at John Killoch's house. This \"[[Passementerie|passement]] bond\" was in part inspired by cheap counterfeit gold and silver thread used in \"passements great or small, plain or ''[[\u00e0 jour]]'', bissets, lilykins, cordons, and fringes\" which quickly discoloured.

However, Lennox claimed that placing more Scottish people in the king's household had become difficult. He wrote to Sir William Livingstone of Kilsyth who had asked for a place for a Napier of  [[Merchiston Castle]];<blockquote>\"although the King has this long time promised Merchiston ever the next vacant place, yet many has been placed over him and in this has found great impediments; for believe that a stranger shall find great difficulty to obtain any such place so long as there is any English man that does aim at it; for it is thought by them all that there is already too many Scots here in such places.\"<ref>''HMC Laing Maunscripts at the University of Edinburgh'', vol. 1 (London, 1914), p. 106-7, modernised here.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn July 1606 he was sent to [[Gravesend]] to welcome [[Christian IV of Denmark]], the younger brother of the queen [[Anne of Denmark]], to England.

The Pynnar Survey of 1618 records Lennox as the chief undertaker for 2,000 acres in the Portlough area and as represented locally by his agent Sir [[Aulay MacAulay of Ardincaple|Aulant Aula]]. Newtownstewart in County Tyrone, now in Northern Ireland, may have been named after him. In the Muster Rolls of 1631 his nephew and eventual heir [[James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond|James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond, 4th Duke of Lennox]] is described as being an undertaker of 4,000 acres. [[Mongavlin Castle]] was built by his son Sir John Stewart, who was also Governor of [[Dumbarton Castle]].\n\nLudovic was involved in the colonization of [[Maine]] in [[New England]].  [[Cape Elizabeth, Maine|Richmond Island and Cape Richmond]], as well as [[Richmond, Maine]] (formerly Fort Richmond), are named after him.\n\nIn March 1614 thieves broke into his lodgings at [[Whitehall Palace]] and stole a gold collar set with pearls and diamonds worth \u00a3300, a silver warming pan, a silver inkstand, and some linen.<ref>John Cordy Jeaffreson, ''Middlesex County Records'', vol. 2 (London, 1882), p. 96.</ref>\n\n==Marriages==\n[[File:Frances, Duchess of Richmond and Lennox.jpg|thumb|[[Frances Howard, Duchess of Richmond|Frances Howard]], Lennox's third wife]]\nKing [[James VI of Scotland]] had discussed with [[Thomas Fowler (courtier)|Thomas Fowler]] the possibility of the Duke marrying [[Arbella Stuart]],<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 17.</ref> but the scheme was not proceeded with.

On 13 February 1593 Lennox decided to play golf with [[James Sandilands (courtier)|Sir James Sandilands]] at Leith. On their way they met John Graham, a [[Court of Session|Lord of Session]], who thought Sandilands was attacking him.

However, Lennox claimed that placing more Scottish people in the king's household had become difficult. He wrote to Sir William Livingstone of Kilsyth who had asked for a place for a Napier of  [[Merchiston Castle]];<blockquote>\"although the King has this long time promised Merchiston ever the next vacant place, yet many has been placed over him and in this has found great impediments; for believe that a stranger shall find great difficulty to obtain any such place so long as there is any English man that does aim at it; for it is thought by them all that there is already too many Scots here in such places.\"<ref>''HMC Laing Maunscripts at the University of Edinburgh'', vol. 1 (London, 1914), p. 106-7, modernised here.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn July 1606 he was sent to [[Gravesend]] to welcome [[Christian IV of Denmark]], the younger brother of the queen [[Anne of Denmark]], to England.

The Pynnar Survey of 1618 records Lennox as the chief undertaker for 2,000 acres in the Portlough area and as represented locally by his agent Sir [[Aulay MacAulay of Ardincaple|Aulant Aula]]. Newtownstewart in County Tyrone, now in Northern Ireland, may have been named after him. In the Muster Rolls of 1631 his nephew and eventual heir [[James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond|James Stewart, 1st Duke of Richmond, 4th Duke of Lennox]] is described as being an undertaker of 4,000 acres. [[Mongavlin Castle]] was built by his son Sir John Stewart, who was also Governor of [[Dumbarton Castle]].\n\nLudovic was involved in the colonization of [[Maine]] in [[New England]].  [[Cape Elizabeth, Maine|Richmond Island and Cape Richmond]], as well as [[Richmond, Maine]] (formerly Fort Richmond), are named after him.\n\nIn March 1614 thieves broke into his lodgings at [[Whitehall Palace]] and stole a gold collar set with pearls and diamonds worth \u00a3300, a silver warming pan, a silver inkstand, and some linen.<ref>John Cordy Jeaffreson, ''Middlesex County Records'', vol. 2 (London, 1882), p. 96.</ref>\n\n==Marriages==\n[[File:Frances, Duchess of Richmond and Lennox.jpg|thumb|[[Frances Howard, Duchess of Richmond|Frances Howard]], Lennox's third wife]]\nKing [[James VI of Scotland]] had discussed with [[Thomas Fowler (courtier)|Thomas Fowler]] the possibility of the Duke marrying [[Arbella Stuart]],<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 17.</ref> but the scheme was not proceeded with.
