offensive ways of describing [[COVID-19]].

Use of these terms (popularised in social media and [[alt-right]] sources) not only downplays the seriousness of the deadly disease but also misinforms by suggesting it is a strain of [[influenza]] (when it is ''not'' a [[flu]]), while simultaneously mocking Chinese culture. It also implies that the pandemic is China's fault, when actually thousands of Chinese suffered and died from COVID-19, especially in Wuhan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-china-virus-white-house-kung-flu|title=Trump doubles down on 'China virus', demands to know who in White House used phrase 'Kung Flu'|date=2020-03-18|website=Fox News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329102358/https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-coronavirus-china-virus-white-house-kung-flu|archive-date=29 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2020/03/19/a-last-desperate-pivot-trump-and-his-allies-go-full-racist-on-coronavirus/|title=A last, desperate pivot: Trump and his allies go full racist on coronavirus|date=2020-03-19|website=Salon|language=en|access-date=2020-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329202750/https://www.salon.com/2020/03/19/a-last-desperate-pivot-trump-and-his-allies-go-full-racist-on-coronavirus/|archive-date=29 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Misinformation===\n\n{{main|Misinformation related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\nThe disease does not spread by shop items that have the name of \"Corona\" on them and products from China are not necessarily at risk of giving the disease either.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/01/30/coronavirus-is-not-the-corona-beer-virus-what-people-are-googling/|title=Coronavirus Is Not The 'Corona Beer Virus', What People Are Googling|last=Lee|first=Bruce Y.|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316122432/https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/01/30/coronavirus-is-not-the-corona-beer-virus-what-people-are-googling/|archive-date=16 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/can-i-get-coronavirus-from-a-package-being-delivered-from-china|title=Can I get coronavirus from a package delivered from China?|date=2020-02-26|website=Daily Breeze|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n\nBecause of its key role in the transmission and progression of SARS-CoV-2, [[Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2|ACE2]] has been the focus of a significant proportion of research and various [[Therapy|therapeutic]] approaches have been suggested.<ref name=\"Xu Zhong Deng Peng p.\"/> Personal hygiene, and a healthy lifestyle and [[Healthy diet|diet]] have been recommended to improve immunity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Li-sheng |last2=Wang |first2=Yi-ru |last3=Ye |first3=Da-wei |last4=Liu |first4=Qing-quan |title=A review of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) based on current evidence |journal=International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents |date=19 March 2020 |page=105948 |doi=10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105948 |pmid=32201353 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300984 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |language=en |issn=0924-8579 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327232545/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300984 |archive-date=27 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Vaccine===\n\n{{main|COVID-19 vaccine}}\n\nThere is no available vaccine, but research into developing a vaccine has been undertaken by various agencies.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

He was promoted to [[Lieutenant Junior Grade]] in June 1939.\n\nHe was assigned as a junior flight division leader (junior [[buntaich\u014d]]) to the 12th Air Group, which was stationed in Central China. His unit flew [[Aichi D1A]] dive bombers out of the bases in [[Anqing]], [[Jiujiang]], and [[Hankou]] to support ground operations in the area. Later on, the unit switched to [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers and participated in [[Bombing of Chongqing]], which was the capital of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalists]] at that time. He was promoted to full [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] in May 1941.\n\nLieutenant Arima was transferred to the carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]'' in the end of 1940 and was assigned as a junior division leader (junior [[buntaich\u014d]]) of dive-bomber squadron. After six months, he was reassigned to [[Suzuka, Mie|Suzuka]] NAS in [[Mie Prefecture]], where he served as an instructor when [[Empire of Japan]] entered the war with [[United States of America]].\n\n==Pacific War==\nIn May 1942, Lieutenant Arima was transferred to the carrier ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|Sh\u014dkaku]]'' and was assigned as a senior flight division leader (senior [[buntaich\u014d]]) of dive-bomber squadron.\n\nIn late August 1942 ''Sh\u014dkaku'' participated in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]. During the attack on USN carriers, Lieutenant Arima was part of the first strike wave that consisted of 27 D3A dive bombers and 10 [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|A6M Zero]] fighters and was under the command of Lieutenant Commander [[Mamoru Seki]]. Arima led one of the three divisions (ch\u016btai), with nine dive bombers under his command. He was in the observer seat of D3A, while his aircraft was piloted by [[Petty officer first class|Petty Officer First Class]] Kiyoto Furuta. USN Combat Air Patrol (CAP) of [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] fighters intercepted the formation of dive bombers, however Arima's division managed to escape into [[cumulonimbus]] clouds and approached US carrier ''[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]'' unharmed. The division made dive-bombing attacks on ''Enterprise'' and released their bombs around an altitude of 500 meters and scored a hit that penetrated the starboard forward corner of her number 3 elevator aft. One of the 250 kilogram [[Armor-piercing shell|semi-AP]] bomb sliced through to the third deck before detonating in the chief's quarters. After the attack, Arima remained north-west of the burning ''Enterprise'' to wait for friendly Zero fighters in order to led them back to the Japanese carriers. However, he encountered several US aircraft that started to case his D3A. He and his pilot evaded the attackers by flying very close to the sea surface and eventually made it back to ''Sh\u014dkaku''.\n\nIn late October 1942, ''Sh\u014dkaku'' was again dispatched to Solomon Islands to support the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] ground assault on [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]] on [[Guadalcanal]]. During the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]], Lieutenant Arima's division was part of the second strike wave that consisted of 27 D3A dive bombers and 5 A6M Zero fighters, which was again under the command of Lieutenant Commander Mamoru Seki. The Zero fighters were led by Lieutenant [[Hideki Shingo|Hideki Shing\u014d]], the fighter squadron leader of ''Sh\u014dkaku''. Arima and his pilot attacked ''Enterprise'' from astern and released the bomb at an altitude of between 450 and 500 meters and scored a hit. Their 250 kilogram semi-AP bomb penetrated the center of the flight deck, around six meters from the forward edge, and detonated inside the carrier causing fires. They did not encounter any CAP on the way out and they climbed to 6000 meters, where Arima observed a dense smoke coming from ''Enterprise''. However, his commander ([[hik\u014dtaich\u014d]]) and ''Sh\u014dkaku'' dive bomber squadron leader, Mamoru Seki, was killed during the attack on ''Enterprise''. Since a simultaneous USN strike damaged the flight deck of ''Sh\u014dkaku'', Arima's D3A landed on ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|Zuikaku]]''.\n\n==Later career==\nAfter the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, Lieutenant Arima was transferred to [[Usa, \u014cita|Usa]] NAS in [[\u014cita Prefecture]] on Kyushu and served as an instructor. He was then transferred to [[Yokosuka]] NAS, where he served as a flight commander. There he was involved in developing communication equipment and radar, and provided instructions on the developed hardware. In October 1944, he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander. He survived the war.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n; Sources\n*{{cite book\n | last = \u6c5f\u9593 | first = \u4fdd\n | year = 1991\n | title = \u6025\u964d\u4e0b\u7206\u6483\u968a\u2015\u65e5\u672c\u6d77\u8ecd\u306e\u30d8\u30eb\u30c0\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc (in Japanese)\n | publisher = \u4eca\u65e5\u306e\u8a71\u984c\u793e\n | isbn = 4875651384\n}}\n* {{cite book \n |last=Lundstrom \n |first=John B. \n |year=2005 \n |edition=New \n |chapter= \n |title=First Team and the Guadalcanal Campaign: Naval Fighter Combat from August to November 1942\n |publisher=Naval Institute Press \n |location=Annapolis, Maryland \n |isbn=1-59114-472-8}}\n* {{cite interview\n|interviewer=Joel Shepherd and Kan Sugahara\n|title=Accounts - Keiichi Arima\n|url=http://www.cv6.org/company/accounts/arima/}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Arima, Keiichi}}\n[[Category:Japanese naval aviators]]\n[[Category:Imperial Japanese Navy officers]]\n[[Category:Imperial Japanese Naval Academy alumni]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n{{Infobox military person\n|name= Keiichi Arima\n|birth_date=\n|death_date=\n|birth_place=\n|death_place=\n|image=\n|caption=\n|nickname= \n|allegiance= [[Empire of Japan]]\n|branch= [[File:Naval Ensign of Japan.svg|22x20px|border]] [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] ([[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]])\n|serviceyears=\n|rank= [[Lieutenant Commander]]\n|commands=\n|unit= 12th Air Group<br/>''[[Japanese aircraft carrier S\u014dry\u016b|S\u014dry\u016b]]''<br/>[[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|''Sh\u014dkaku'']]\n|battles='''[[World War II]]:'''<br/>[[Second Sino-Japanese War]]<br/>[[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]<br/>[[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]]<br/>[[Solomon Islands Campaign]]\n|awards= \n|laterwork=\n}}\n{{Japanese name|Arima}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Keiichi Arima'''|\u6709\u99ac \u656c\u4e00|Arima Keiichi|}} was a non-aviator [[dive bomber]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during [[World War II]].

Many of these discoveries are outlined in Siljander's book, ''A Deadly Misunderstanding: A Congressman's Quest to Bridge the Muslim-Christian Divide'' which was endorsed by a diverse group of scholars including Dr. [[Sidney H.

This relationship and prayer partnership between Siljander and Bashir continued as the [[War in Darfur]] began emerging. During one of their many meetings, President Bashir is reported to have asked Siljander, \"What should I do about Darfur?\" Bashir had previously declared he would not allow [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN Peacekeepers]] to be deployed in Darfur and rejected the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706]]. However, Siljander is attributed to having proposed the ultimate solution of a hybrid [[African Union]] and United Nations ([[United Nations\u2013African Union Mission in Darfur|UNAMID]]) peacekeeping force. Siljander then worked with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to draft [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1769]] which was accepted by Sudan, and helped to end the genocide. \n\nSudanese Foreign Minister [[Ali Ahmed Karti|Ali Karti]], in a video testimony,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trac5.org/secret-darfur-solution-revealed/|title=Ali Karti on Darfur|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> stated:\n\n{{Quote|text=\"The [Darfur] solution came from this very humble man...the solution came from [Siljander].\"|author=Ali Karti|title=Foreign Minister of Sudan|source=}}\n\n[[Andrew Natsios]], the U.S. [[Diplomatic rank|Special Envoy]] to Sudan, in a publicly available letter<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bridgestocommonground.org/accomplishments/|title=Reference Darfur track-record|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> to Siljander dated October 21, 2007 is quoted as saying: \n\n{{Quote|text=\"...as a Christian layman interested in peace and reconciliation.

Hanrahan]], a registered lobbyist who did in fact legally represent IARA, a claim which is supported by Robert Hanrahan's affidavit and DOJ records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmo/file/877561/download|title=Affiliated Plea Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> However, the government claimed that this was not a legitimate donation, implying that Siljander had instead used the funds as a [[quid pro quo]] to lobby for the U.S. based charity. \n\nOn January 12, 2012, Siljander was sentenced to a year and a day in prison which, with good behavior, effectively equates to four to five months of actual time served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2012/01/former_michigan_congressman_ma.html,|title=Former Michigan congressman Mark Siljander sentenced to year in federal prison|publisher=}}</ref> He turned himself in on March 10, 2012 to [[Federal Correctional Institution, Petersburg]]. Despite his short sentence and the nature of his charges, Siljander was originally assigned to the medium security prison, not a camp. He was soon transferred to the low security facility which typically housed violent offenders and pedophiles with a 10-year sentence or less remaining to be served. \n\nWeeks before his scheduled release, Siljander was diagnosed with a rare terminal cancer called [[Malignant rhabdoid tumour|Rhabdoid Sarcoma]] and was expected to die in three months or less. Having no health insurance and prior to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] passage, Siljander voluntarily doubled his prison sentence and was transferred to the maximum security facility at [[Federal Medical Center, Butner]]. After a round surgery and radiation, Siljander was released from prison on December 20, 2012 to be reunited with his family for the holidays. He has been cancer-free for 7 years, and according to doctors at [[Duke University Hospital]] and consulting doctors at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|John's Hopkins Hospital]], Siljander may be one of the only adults to survive this rare form of cancer.\n\n===False claims===\n\nThe language used by federal prosecutors in the press conference announcing Siljander's indictment prompted global headlines<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/01/16/exlawmaker-charged-in-ter_n_81842.html, \"Ex-Lawmaker Charged in Terror Conspiracy\"</ref><ref>http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,323250,00.html, \"Ex-Congressman, U.N.

Clarifying the record, however, the presiding Judge Nanette Laughrey is quoted during sentencing saying: \"But the truth is, when you look at this objectively, this is not a case about [Siljander] aiding a terrorist, it just isn't...\"<ref>\"Transcript of Sentencing Proceedings\" No. 07-00087-07-CR-W-NKL, January 11, 2012 reference line 20-22 on page 36 of the transcript. </ref>\n\nAlso, under the government's own headline, \"Terrorism and National Security\", the Justice Department included the Siljander guilty plea as one of their two announced successes against terrorism. The inflammatory and misleading January 2008 press conference provoked a firestorm of fallacious media reporting that continued through 2013.<ref>http://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmo/criminal-division/terrorism-and-national-security, \"Terrorism and National Security: Recent Significant Cases\"</ref>\n\nThe day following the initial press conference, the Justice Department's Press Release corrected the \"terrorism\" statements by stating, \"It is important to note that the indictment does not charge any of the defendants with material support of terrorism, nor does it allege that they knowingly financed acts of terror.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2008/January/08_nsd_029.html|title=#08-029: 01-16-08 Islamic Charity Charged with Terrorist Financing; Former U.S. Congressman Indicted for Money Laundering|website=www.justice.gov}}</ref>  It went largely unreported. \n\n===Response from Siljander===\n\nUpon his release from prison, Siljander publicly protested his innocence, and claimed that two Muslim co-defendants (whom he had never met nor spoken with) had been induced to give false testimony against him in exchange for immunity from prosecution.\n\nSiljander's open letter to his newsletter subscribers was quoted in full in several venues, and contains the following narrative: \n\n{{quote|Throughout my 15 years in various levels of government, I tried to make the world safer by political means. This failed. However, these experiences led me to revelations that address the needs of a dominant issue in our time\u2014bridging the growing divide among Christians, Muslims & Jews. Over time this work produced a model for peacemaking and problem solving in complex crises in places like Iraq, Libya and Sudan. These efforts gained traction for peacemaking with U.S. & world leaders; while my controversial book on the subject, ''A Deadly Misunderstanding'', was being readied for a major release. My approach required working with both friends and enemies of our country.\n\nTo support this exciting peace and faith bridging work, we raised funds for travel, research and writing. One donor, a 25-year-old U.S. based, government approved Muslim charity, was recommended by one of my Muslim associates in the work. The charity's principals were later indicted on grounds of supporting terrorists and misappropriating [U.S.] government grant funds. Those opposed to my [peacemaking] work seized this opportunity to discredit me by insisting I testify against the charity. I refused to give a false testimony and was consequently indicted on outlandish charges of money laundering & conspiracy. This exploded into a media frenzy tying me with terror funding, even though the judge reminded prosecutors that the case had nothing to do with terrorism or national security. After four years of exaggerated accusations, all major charges were dropped, leaving only obstruction of justice for claiming to the FBI that I had not lobbied for the Muslim charity and [for] not registering as a lobbyist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldmag.com/2013/11/siljander_declares_his_innocence|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105085238/http://www.worldmag.com/2013/11/siljander_declares_his_innocence|url-status=live|archive-date=2013-11-05|title=Siljander declares his innocence}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last= Siljander |first= Mark D. |title= A Deadly Misunderstanding: A Congressman's Quest to Bridge the Muslim-Christian Divide |publisher= [[HarperOne]] |location= [[New York City|New York]] |date=October 2008 |isbn= 978-0-06-143828-8 }}<ref name=\"nautilusbookawards.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nautilusbookawards.com/2009_Silver_Winners.html|title=2009 NAUTILUS BOOK AWARDS SILVER WINNERS|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517014226/http://www.nautilusbookawards.com/2009_Silver_Winners.html|archivedate=May 17, 2009|accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\n* Belz, Emily. \"Bad Connections\".

Siljander has pioneered a unique methodology of study, asserting that the [[Aramaic]] heart language of Jesus found in the New Testament [[Peshitta]] can be constructive in dealing with theological disagreements by comparing it to the [[Arabic]] of the Qur\u2019an and the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] of the Old Testament. Many of these discoveries are outlined in Siljander's book, ''A Deadly Misunderstanding: A Congressman's Quest to Bridge the Muslim-Christian Divide'' which was endorsed by a diverse group of scholars including Dr. [[Sidney H.

Siljander, having been a sitting member of Congressman during the [[1986 United States bombing of Libya]] which purportedly killed Gaddafi' daughter, felt inspired to apologize for killing [[Hana Gaddafi]]. This act notably changed the tone of this first meeting which concluded with the implication that Gaddafi would promptly extradite the long-sought Libyan suspects of [[Pan Am Flight 103]], a terrorist attack which killed 270 people over [[Lockerbie|Lockerbie, Scotland]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_(miniseries)|title=Netflix|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Deadly-Misunderstanding-Bridge-Muslim-Christian/dp/0997625309/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0/136-3332295-9375026?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0997625309&pd_rd_r=2e1af0f6-244f-4a04-9296-d9b5684bdbc1&pd_rd_w=ckxUo&pd_rd_wg=ScHsK&pf_rd_p=5cfcfe89-300f-47d2-b1ad-a4e27203a02a&pf_rd_r=FFMC6EA0FHHJ6YP5YR9B&psc=1&refRID=FFMC6EA0FHHJ6YP5YR9B|title=A Deadly Misunderstanding, chapter \"My Apology\"|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The terror bombing suspects were handed over to be tried for their crimes 10 days later and Muammar Gaddafi took responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing and paid compensation to the victims' families in 2003.

This relationship and prayer partnership between Siljander and Bashir continued as the [[War in Darfur]] began emerging. During one of their many meetings, President Bashir is reported to have asked Siljander, \"What should I do about Darfur?\" Bashir had previously declared he would not allow [[United Nations peacekeeping|UN Peacekeepers]] to be deployed in Darfur and rejected the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706]]. However, Siljander is attributed to having proposed the ultimate solution of a hybrid [[African Union]] and United Nations ([[United Nations\u2013African Union Mission in Darfur|UNAMID]]) peacekeeping force. Siljander then worked with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to draft [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1769]] which was accepted by Sudan, and helped to end the genocide. \n\nSudanese Foreign Minister [[Ali Ahmed Karti|Ali Karti]], in a video testimony,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trac5.org/secret-darfur-solution-revealed/|title=Ali Karti on Darfur|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> stated:\n\n{{Quote|text=\"The [Darfur] solution came from this very humble man...the solution came from [Siljander].\"|author=Ali Karti|title=Foreign Minister of Sudan|source=}}\n\n[[Andrew Natsios]], the U.S. [[Diplomatic rank|Special Envoy]] to Sudan, in a publicly available letter<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bridgestocommonground.org/accomplishments/|title=Reference Darfur track-record|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> to Siljander dated October 21, 2007 is quoted as saying: \n\n{{Quote|text=\"...as a Christian layman interested in peace and reconciliation.

Accessed August 31, 2011.]</ref> The basis for these charges was Siljander's non-profit receipt of a $50,000 donation from the [[Islamic American Relief Agency]] (\"IARA\") which, at the time, was still in good standing with the IRS and not yet designated on [[Office of Foreign Assets Control|OFAC]]'s [[Specially Designated Global Terrorist|SDGT]] list. It was later discovered that IARA violated U.S. sanctions by sending money to Iraq, purportedly as part of their charitable operations.\n\nSiljander asserted to investigators that this contribution was used to support his own non-profit research and to help publish his then upcoming book on the subject of Muslim-Christian relations. Siljander further asserted that he, instead of lobbying, referred [[Robert P. Hanrahan]], a registered lobbyist who did in fact legally represent IARA, a claim which is supported by Robert Hanrahan's affidavit and DOJ records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmo/file/877561/download|title=Affiliated Plea Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> However, the government claimed that this was not a legitimate donation, implying that Siljander had instead used the funds as a [[quid pro quo]] to lobby for the U.S. based charity. \n\nOn January 12, 2012, Siljander was sentenced to a year and a day in prison which, with good behavior, effectively equates to four to five months of actual time served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2012/01/former_michigan_congressman_ma.html,|title=Former Michigan congressman Mark Siljander sentenced to year in federal prison|publisher=}}</ref> He turned himself in on March 10, 2012 to [[Federal Correctional Institution, Petersburg]]. Despite his short sentence and the nature of his charges, Siljander was originally assigned to the medium security prison, not a camp. He was soon transferred to the low security facility which typically housed violent offenders and pedophiles with a 10-year sentence or less remaining to be served. \n\nWeeks before his scheduled release, Siljander was diagnosed with a rare terminal cancer called [[Malignant rhabdoid tumour|Rhabdoid Sarcoma]] and was expected to die in three months or less. Having no health insurance and prior to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] passage, Siljander voluntarily doubled his prison sentence and was transferred to the maximum security facility at [[Federal Medical Center, Butner]]. After a round surgery and radiation, Siljander was released from prison on December 20, 2012 to be reunited with his family for the holidays. He has been cancer-free for 7 years, and according to doctors at [[Duke University Hospital]] and consulting doctors at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital|John's Hopkins Hospital]], Siljander may be one of the only adults to survive this rare form of cancer.\n\n===False claims===\n\nThe language used by federal prosecutors in the press conference announcing Siljander's indictment prompted global headlines<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/01/16/exlawmaker-charged-in-ter_n_81842.html, \"Ex-Lawmaker Charged in Terror Conspiracy\"</ref><ref>http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,323250,00.html, \"Ex-Congressman, U.N.

Clarifying the record, however, the presiding Judge Nanette Laughrey is quoted during sentencing saying: \"But the truth is, when you look at this objectively, this is not a case about [Siljander] aiding a terrorist, it just isn't...\"<ref>\"Transcript of Sentencing Proceedings\" No. 07-00087-07-CR-W-NKL, January 11, 2012 reference line 20-22 on page 36 of the transcript. </ref>\n\nAlso, under the government's own headline, \"Terrorism and National Security\", the Justice Department included the Siljander guilty plea as one of their two announced successes against terrorism. The inflammatory and misleading January 2008 press conference provoked a firestorm of fallacious media reporting that continued through 2013.<ref>http://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmo/criminal-division/terrorism-and-national-security, \"Terrorism and National Security: Recent Significant Cases\"</ref>\n\nThe day following the initial press conference, the Justice Department's Press Release corrected the \"terrorism\" statements by stating, \"It is important to note that the indictment does not charge any of the defendants with material support of terrorism, nor does it allege that they knowingly financed acts of terror.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2008/January/08_nsd_029.html|title=#08-029: 01-16-08 Islamic Charity Charged with Terrorist Financing; Former U.S. Congressman Indicted for Money Laundering|website=www.justice.gov}}</ref>  It went largely unreported. \n\n===Response from Siljander===\n\nUpon his release from prison, Siljander publicly protested his innocence, and claimed that two Muslim co-defendants (whom he had never met nor spoken with) had been induced to give false testimony against him in exchange for immunity from prosecution.\n\nSiljander's open letter to his newsletter subscribers was quoted in full in several venues, and contains the following narrative: \n\n{{quote|Throughout my 15 years in various levels of government, I tried to make the world safer by political means. This failed. However, these experiences led me to revelations that address the needs of a dominant issue in our time\u2014bridging the growing divide among Christians, Muslims & Jews. Over time this work produced a model for peacemaking and problem solving in complex crises in places like Iraq, Libya and Sudan. These efforts gained traction for peacemaking with U.S. & world leaders; while my controversial book on the subject, ''A Deadly Misunderstanding'', was being readied for a major release. My approach required working with both friends and enemies of our country.\n\nTo support this exciting peace and faith bridging work, we raised funds for travel, research and writing. One donor, a 25-year-old U.S. based, government approved Muslim charity, was recommended by one of my Muslim associates in the work. The charity's principals were later indicted on grounds of supporting terrorists and misappropriating [U.S.] government grant funds. Those opposed to my [peacemaking] work seized this opportunity to discredit me by insisting I testify against the charity. I refused to give a false testimony and was consequently indicted on outlandish charges of money laundering & conspiracy. This exploded into a media frenzy tying me with terror funding, even though the judge reminded prosecutors that the case had nothing to do with terrorism or national security. After four years of exaggerated accusations, all major charges were dropped, leaving only obstruction of justice for claiming to the FBI that I had not lobbied for the Muslim charity and [for] not registering as a lobbyist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldmag.com/2013/11/siljander_declares_his_innocence|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105085238/http://www.worldmag.com/2013/11/siljander_declares_his_innocence|url-status=live|archive-date=2013-11-05|title=Siljander declares his innocence}}</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last= Siljander |first= Mark D. |title= A Deadly Misunderstanding: A Congressman's Quest to Bridge the Muslim-Christian Divide |publisher= [[HarperOne]] |location= [[New York City|New York]] |date=October 2008 |isbn= 978-0-06-143828-8 }}<ref name=\"nautilusbookawards.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nautilusbookawards.com/2009_Silver_Winners.html|title=2009 NAUTILUS BOOK AWARDS SILVER WINNERS|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517014226/http://www.nautilusbookawards.com/2009_Silver_Winners.html|archivedate=May 17, 2009|accessdate=2009-05-06}}</ref>\n* Belz, Emily. \"Bad Connections\".

Like his predecessors he was heavily dependent on the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), and was forced to comply to Dutch demands to extirpate spice trees in his domains, ensuring Dutch monopoly of the profitable [[spice trade]]. On the other hand, the Ternate-VOC alliance led to a large increase of Ternatan territory in the war with [[Sultanate of Gowa|Makassar]] in 1667.\n\n==Accession==\n\nKaicili (prince) Tahubo, the later Mandar Syah, was only a few years old when his father Sultan [[Mudafar Syah I]] passed away in 1627. He had two older brothers, Kaicili Kalamata and Kaicili Manilha, and was therefore not a likely candidate for the Ternatan throne.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987) ''Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel''. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. II, p. 20.</ref> An older kinsman, [[Hamza of Ternate|Hamza]] ruled as Sultan from 1627 to 1648 when he passed away without sons. Now the grandees of the kingdom wanted Manilha to be their new ruler, while Muslim clerics preferred Kalamata. However, the VOC, whose influence in the affairs of Ternate was on the rise, insisted that the youngest brother Tahubo should be installed since he had been raised under the supervision of the Dutch governors in Ternate.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1895) ''Bouwstoffen voor de geschiedenis der Nederlanders in den Maleischen Archipel'', Vol. III. 's Gravenhage: Nijhoff, p. xxxvii.</ref> The Ternatan elite was less than pleased, and so Tahubo, who took the title Sultan Mandar Syah, was even more dependent on Dutch goodwill than his two predecessors. His Dutch leanings can be seen from the names that he gave a few of his sons: Prince Amsterdam, Prince Rotterdam.\n\n==The rebellion of Manilha==\n\nDissatisfaction with Mandar Syah's dependence on the Company soon led to open opposition from the influential House of Fala Rahi and the various Bobatos (chiefs) of Ternate. In August 1650 they elected his brother Manilha, supposedly a mentally unstable person, as Sultan in opposition. They believed that Manilha would be more sensible to Ternatan community leaders. The attempt soon faltered, since the Dutch were not ready to abandon their candidate. Admiral Arnold de Vlamingh van Oudshoorn turned up in Maluku in 1651 and forced Manilha to yield. The other brother Kalamata, an able figure and an expert in Islamic law, continued to create trouble for the Dutch during the coming years and eventually fled to Ternate's political rival [[Makassar]]. Anti-Dutch opposition also spread to the Hoamoal Peninsula in West [[Seram Island|Ceram]] and the Muslim realm Hitu in [[Ambon]], both of which were formally Ternatan dependencies. Admiral de Vlamingh van Oudshoorn, enjoined by Mandar Syah, spent several years suppressing the resistance, an extremely bloody affair that finally ensured total Dutch control over the clove-producing Ambon Quarter.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993) ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 162-4. </ref> \n\n==Extirpation of clove trees==\n\nApart from the rebellions, the selling of spices to merchants operating outside the VOC was a problem for the Dutch authorities, who deemed such practices \"smuggling\". The solution was to force the periphery areas in Maluku to stop producing spices. Here Mandar Syah was a useful tool to enforce Dutch spice monopoly. A treaty with the Sultan was signed on 31 July 1652. Mandar Syah agreed to allow the destruction of all clove trees in Ternate and the Ambon dependencies. In return, the Sultan received an annual sum (''recognitiepenningen'') of 12,000 rijksdaalders. Some of this money was to be allocated to the various Bobatos. In practice, this became a way for the Sultan to keep the Bobatos in check since those showing signs of disobedience had their subsidies withdrawn. This differed from the old system where the Bobatos kept incomes from the clove trade for the needs of their own community (''soa'').<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 167-8.</ref> Similar contracts were concluded with the other sultanates [[Bacan Islands|Bacan]] and [[Tidore Sultanate|Tidore]].<ref>F.C. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. I, p. 52.</ref> The Company and the Sultans upheld the monopoly by means of regular expeditions, ''hongitochten'', that cruised the islands and destroyed any spice tree that was found. Such ''hongitochten'' were conducted until the 19th century and gained notoriety for brutality.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990) ''Turbulent times past in Ternate and Tidore''. Banda Naira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira, p. 171-2.</ref>\n\n==Political gains==\n\nThe rise of the Makassar Kingdom in the first half of the 17th century had grave consequences for the Sultante of Ternate. Large areas such as [[Buton]], [[Kingdom of Banggai|Banggai]], [[Bungku|Tobungku]], [[Menado]], [[Sula Islands|Sula]] and [[Buru Island|Buru]] fell away from Ternatan overlordship.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 164.</ref> Here, the growing power of the VOC turned out to be advantageous. Ternate supported the [[Makassar War|VOC expedition to Makassar]] in 1667 with a small force. Makassar was crushed with the help of the [[Bugis people|Bugis]] leader [[Arung Palakka]] and forced to sign the [[Treaty of Bongaya]] in the same year. One of the stipulations was that Ternate regained its old vassals in [[Sulawesi]] and adjacent islands.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1981) ''The heritage of Arung Palakka''. The Hague: Nijhoff, p. 306.</ref> Another political rival, the [[Tidore Sultanate]], left its traditional alliance with [[Spain]] and made contracts with the VOC in 1657 and 1667, which for the moment put an end to the long history of Ternatan-Tidorese rivalries and petty wars.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 190.</ref>\n\nThe legacy of Sultan Mandar Syah was therefore ambivalent: on one hand close dependency on the VOC, but on the other hand a strengthening of the Sultan's own powers at the expense of officials and chiefs, and a dramatic increase in territory. These contradiction would lead to open anti-Dutch rebellion under his son [[Sibori Amsterdam]] who succeeded him in 1675.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 179-85.</ref>\n\n==Family==\n\nSultan Mandar Syah married the following wives and co-wives:<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 20-1.</ref>\n* A daughter of Sultan Saidi of [[Tidore]] (possibly merely engaged)\n* A princess of [[Buton]]\n* Maya from Ternate, mother of Boki Mahir\n* Lawa, mother of Amsterdam, Malayu, Mauludu and Sarabu\n* Maryam from Sahu, mother of Rotterdam and Boki Gogugu\n* Ainun, mother of Toloko\n* A [[Makassarese people|Makassarese]] woman, mother of Neman\n* A [[Gorontalo|Gorontalese]] woman, mother of Hukum and Diojo\n\nHis sons (Kaicili, princes) and daughters (Boki, princesses) were:<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. 20-1.</ref>\n* Boki Mahir Gammalamo\n* Kaicili [[Sibori Amsterdam]], Sultan of Ternate\n* Kaicili Malayu\n* Boki Mauludu\n* Boki Sarabu\n* Kaicili Rotterdam alias Yena\n* Boki Gogugu\n* Kaicili Toloko, Sultan of Ternate\n* Kaicili Neman\n* Kaicili Hukum\n* Boki Diojo\n* Boki Timonga\n* Boki Tabilo\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of rulers of Maluku]]\n* [[Sultanate of Ternate]]\n* [[Tidore Sultanate]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Hamza of Ternate|Hamza]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Sultan of Ternate|years=1648\u20131675}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Sibori Amsterdam]]}}\n{{end}}\n\n[[Category:Sultans of Ternate]]\n[[Category:Ternate Sultanate]]\n[[Category:People from Maluku Islands]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox royalty\n|name  = Sultan Mandar Syah\n|succession  = [[Sultan of Ternate]]\n|reign       = 1648\u20131675\n|predecessor = [[Hamza of Ternate|Hamza]]\n|successor   = [[Sibori Amsterdam]]\n|regnal name =  \n|house       = \n|father      = [[Mudafar Syah I]]\n|mother      = \n|birth_date  = \n|birth_place = \n|death_date  = 3 January 1675\n|religion    = [[Islam]]\n}}\n\n'''Sultan Mandar Syah''' (b. c. 1625-d. 3 January 1675) was the 11th Sultan of [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate]] who reigned from 1648 to 1675.

He ruled from 1627 to 1648, during a time when the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) increasingly dominated this part of maritime [[Southeast Asia]], and the increasing power of the [[Sultanate of Gowa|Makassar kingdom]] threatened the Ternatan possessions. \n\n==Spanish exile and return==\n\nHamza was the third son of Kaicili (prince) Tolu (d. c. 1590), himself a son of sultan [[Hairun]] (r. 1535-1570). His brothers were Hafsin, Naya and Kapita Laut Ali.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987) ''Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel''. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. II, p. 17.</ref> When the Spanish invaded and occupied Ternate in 1606, Hamza was among the many members of the royal family who were brought to the [[Spanish Philippines]] as state prisoners. While in [[Manila]] he was Hispanicized in many ways: he was baptized and took the name Pedro de Acu\u00f1a, after the Spanish governor who had led the 1606 invasion, and married in the church. Since he was therefore expected to follow Iberian interests, the Manila authorities allowed him to return to Ternate in 1627.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993) ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 158-9.</ref> At this time Ternate was an autonomous kingdom, but was bound by a contract with the VOC to follow Dutch commercial policy, and kept a number of Dutch garrisons on its territory. Some months after Hamza's return, the current Sultan [[Mudafar Syah I]] passed away.\n\nAlthough there were other candidates for the throne, the Ternatan state council chose to appoint Hamza as new Sultan of Ternate, the more as he reverted to Islam on his return. The Dutch, who were not consulted on the matter, feared that the choice of ruler might strengthen the Spanish who occupied a number of forts on Ternate and its neighbor [[Tidore Sultanate|Tidore]] since 1606. They would rather have seen his forceful brother Kapita Laut Ali, the sea lord, as the new Sultan. Eventually they accepted the decision of the council, however.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 158.</ref> Though fluent in Spanish and educated by [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] fathers, he openly denounced his former Spanish protectors, and never seems to have seriously plotted to place Maluku under the sway of Manila during his reign.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990) ''Turbulent times past in Ternate and Tidore''. Banda Naira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira, p. 152-4.</ref> He was nevertheless regarded as an extremely cunning and ambivalent figure who operated between Spanish and Dutch interests.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1984) ''Documenta Malucensia'', Vol. III. Rome: Jesuit Historical Institute, p. 470.</ref>\n\n==Attempts to strengthen the realm==\n\nOpinions about the personality of Hamza were divided, as he was variously described as \"gentle and discreet\" or tyrannical.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 158-9; P.A. Tiele (1890) ''Bouwstoffen voor de geschiedenis der Nederlanders in den Maleischen Archipel'', Vol. II. 's Gravenhage: Nijhoff, p. xxxv-xxxvi.</ref> He certainly worked to strengthen the center of the kingdom by forced migrations. Christians from Moro [[Halmahera]] were forced to settle in Malayu on Ternate Island, and people from Loloda were moved to [[Jailolo]], opposite Ternate. He also strengthened his position at the cost of the Jogugu (first minister) and the Kapita Laut Ali, who was sent on an expedition to reaffirm Ternate's power in [[Sulawesi]] and [[Buton]], and died en route in 1632 or 1633.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. </ref> He also sent expeditions to curb his formal vassals, the autonomous leaders in West [[Seram Island|Ceram]] and Hitu in [[Ambon]], during the 1640s. Ambon was a very important center for clove production, and the chiefs were not easily brought to obedience. The dissatisfied Ambonese asked the King of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]] ([[Makassar]]) to be their protector. Hamza in turn called for Dutch assistance to curb the rebellion.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 160-1.</ref> All this formed part of the notorious Ambon Wars where the VOC troops crushed all opposition with enormous loss of life.<ref>E.S. de Klerck (1975) ''History of the Netherlands East indies''. Amsterdam: B.M. Israel, Vol. I, p. 243-4.</ref> Hamza was less lucky in [[North Sulawesi]] where the gold-rich [[Gorontalo]] refused to obey him. An expedition in 1647 achieved nothing, and the vague Ternatan claim once again had to be backed up with VOC support.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 162.</ref> In spite of the Sultan's efforts, the territory shrank drastically in these decades due to the great expansion of Makassar. By 1636 the King of Gowa had replaced Ternate as the overlord in [[Buton]], [[Banggai]], [[Bungku|Tobungku]], [[Menado]] and [[Buru Island|Buru]].<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 164.</ref>\n\nHamza also intervened in the affairs of Ternate's traditional rival, Tidore, which was still allied to Spain. Sultan Ngarolamo of Tidore was deposed in 1633 with Ternatan support and replaced with his cousin Sultan Gorontalo, who had lived in Ternate as Hamza's proteg\u00e9. The VOC was not happy about Hamza's activism, since it was apparently just a way to increase royal Ternatan influence in the region, which could be detrimental to Dutch interests. Hamza allowed the deposed monarch to stay in Ternate, where his daughter was married to Hamza. Some years later, however, he saw it that Ngarolamo was murdered when there were doubts about his sincerity.<ref>P.A, Tiele (1890), p. liii, 380-3.</ref> Meanwhile, the Spanish in turn murdered Sultan Gorontalo in 1639, and Tidore remained allied with them until 1663.\n\n==Death==\n\nHamza, already old by the standards of the time, passed away in May 1648. After being a practitioner of Islam for decades he still, according to the rumours, invoked Catholic saints at his deathbed.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1895) ''Bouwstoffen voor de geschiedenis der Nederlanders in den Maleischen Archipel'', Vol. III. 's Gravenhage: Nijhoff, p. 391.</ref> He left no sons in spite of his numerous marriages.

He ruled from 1627 to 1648, during a time when the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) increasingly dominated this part of maritime [[Southeast Asia]], and the increasing power of the [[Sultanate of Gowa|Makassar kingdom]] threatened the Ternatan possessions. \n\n==Spanish exile and return==\n\nHamza was the third son of Kaicili (prince) Tolu (d. c. 1590), himself a son of sultan [[Hairun]] (r. 1535-1570). His brothers were Hafsin, Naya and Kapita Laut Ali.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987) ''Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel''. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. II, p. 17.</ref> When the Spanish invaded and occupied Ternate in 1606, Hamza was among the many members of the royal family who were brought to the [[Spanish Philippines]] as state prisoners. While in [[Manila]] he was Hispanicized in many ways: he was baptized and took the name Pedro de Acu\u00f1a, after the Spanish governor who had led the 1606 invasion, and married in the church. Since he was therefore expected to follow Iberian interests, the Manila authorities allowed him to return to Ternate in 1627.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993) ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 158-9.</ref> At this time Ternate was an autonomous kingdom, but was bound by a contract with the VOC to follow Dutch commercial policy, and kept a number of Dutch garrisons on its territory. Some months after Hamza's return, the current Sultan [[Mudafar Syah I]] passed away.\n\nAlthough there were other candidates for the throne, the Ternatan state council chose to appoint Hamza as new Sultan of Ternate, the more as he reverted to Islam on his return. The Dutch, who were not consulted on the matter, feared that the choice of ruler might strengthen the Spanish who occupied a number of forts on Ternate and its neighbor [[Tidore Sultanate|Tidore]] since 1606. They would rather have seen his forceful brother Kapita Laut Ali, the sea lord, as the new Sultan. Eventually they accepted the decision of the council, however.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 158.</ref> Though fluent in Spanish and educated by [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] fathers, he openly denounced his former Spanish protectors, and never seems to have seriously plotted to place Maluku under the sway of Manila during his reign.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990) ''Turbulent times past in Ternate and Tidore''. Banda Naira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira, p. 152-4.</ref> He was nevertheless regarded as an extremely cunning and ambivalent figure who operated between Spanish and Dutch interests.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1984) ''Documenta Malucensia'', Vol. III. Rome: Jesuit Historical Institute, p. 470.</ref>\n\n==Attempts to strengthen the realm==\n\nOpinions about the personality of Hamza were divided, as he was variously described as \"gentle and discreet\" or tyrannical.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 158-9; P.A. Tiele (1890) ''Bouwstoffen voor de geschiedenis der Nederlanders in den Maleischen Archipel'', Vol. II. 's Gravenhage: Nijhoff, p. xxxv-xxxvi.</ref> He certainly worked to strengthen the center of the kingdom by forced migrations. Christians from Moro [[Halmahera]] were forced to settle in Malayu on Ternate Island, and people from Loloda were moved to [[Jailolo]], opposite Ternate. He also strengthened his position at the cost of the Jogugu (first minister) and the Kapita Laut Ali, who was sent on an expedition to reaffirm Ternate's power in [[Sulawesi]] and [[Buton]], and died en route in 1632 or 1633.<ref>C.F. van Fraassen (1987), Vol. II, p. </ref> He also sent expeditions to curb his formal vassals, the autonomous leaders in West [[Ceram]] and Hitu in [[Ambon]], during the 1640s. Ambon was a very important center for clove production, and the chiefs were not easily brought to obedience. The dissatisfied Ambonese asked the King of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]] ([[Makassar]]) to be their protector. Hamza in turn called for Dutch assistance to curb the rebellion.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 160-1.</ref> All this formed part of the notorious Ambon Wars where the VOC troops crushed all opposition with enormous loss of life.<ref>E.S. de Klerck (1975) ''History of the Netherlands East indies''. Amsterdam: B.M. Israel, Vol. I, p. 243-4.</ref> Hamza was less lucky in [[North Sulawesi]] where the gold-rich [[Gorontalo]] refused to obey him. An expedition in 1647 achieved nothing, and the vague Ternatan claim once again had to be backed up with VOC support.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 162.</ref> In spite of the Sultan's efforts, the territory shrank drastically in these decades due to the great expansion of Makassar. By 1636 the King of Gowa had replaced Ternate as the overlord in [[Buton]], [[Banggai]], [[Bungku|Tobungku]], [[Menado]] and [[Buru Island|Buru]].<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 164.</ref>\n\nHamza also intervened in the affairs of Ternate's traditional rival, Tidore, which was still allied to Spain. Sultan Ngarolamo of Tidore was deposed in 1633 with Ternatan support and replaced with his cousin Sultan Gorontalo, who had lived in Ternate as Hamza's proteg\u00e9. The VOC was not happy about Hamza's activism, since it was apparently just a way to increase royal Ternatan influence in the region, which could be detrimental to Dutch interests. Hamza allowed the deposed monarch to stay in Ternate, where his daughter was married to Hamza. Some years later, however, he saw it that Ngarolamo was murdered when there were doubts about his sincerity.<ref>P.A, Tiele (1890), p. liii, 380-3.</ref> Meanwhile, the Spanish in turn murdered Sultan Gorontalo in 1639, and Tidore remained allied with them until 1663.\n\n==Death==\n\nHamza, already old by the standards of the time, passed away in May 1648. After being a practitioner of Islam for decades he still, according to the rumours, invoked Catholic saints at his deathbed.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1895) ''Bouwstoffen voor de geschiedenis der Nederlanders in den Maleischen Archipel'', Vol. III. 's Gravenhage: Nijhoff, p. 391.</ref> He left no sons in spite of his numerous marriages.
