The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

Masters champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship]], and the [[PGA Championship]]) for the next five years (except for amateur winners, unless they turn pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

Officially known as the \"Masters Club\", it includes only past winners of the Masters, although selected members of the Augusta National Golf Club have been included as honorary members, usually the chairman.\n\nThe defending champion, as host, selects the menu for the dinner. Frequently, Masters champions have served cuisine from their home regions prepared by the Masters chef. Notable examples have included [[haggis]], served by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Sandy Lyle]] in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html#dinner |title=Masters Club |publisher=www.masters.org |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109192302/http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[bobotie]], a South African dish, served at the behest of 2008 champion [[Trevor Immelman]]. Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut.

Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff.

The bentgrass resulted in significantly faster putting surfaces, which has required a reduction in some of the contours of the greens over time.<ref name=bent>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/augusta/news/2001/03/28/greens_bentgrass/ |title=Desire for faster greens led to use of Bentgrass |work=CNNSI.com & The Augusta Chronicle |last=Westin |first=David |date=March 28, 2001 |accessdate=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425205409/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/augusta/news/2001/03/28/greens_bentgrass/ |archivedate=April 25, 2009}}</ref>\n\nJust before the 1975 tournament, the common beige sand in the bunkers was replaced with the now-signature white feldspar.

The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket);<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070405 |title=The real story behind the green jacket |last=Lukas |first=Paul |work=ESPN |accessdate=November 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Seve Ballesteros]] who, in an interview with [[Peter Alliss]] from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and [[Henry Picard]], whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in [[Beachwood, Ohio]], where he was the club professional for many years.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/04/10/8093250/master-teacher-nearly-forgotten-now-teaching-pro-henry-picard-was-a-big-star-when-he-won-the-1938-masters |title=Master Teacher: Nearly forgotten now, teaching pro Henry Picard was a big star when he won the 1938 Masters |first=Rick |last=Lispey |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |date=April 10, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |title=Michael Kernicki hosts Major Championship at Canterbury Golf Club |publisher=GolfGuide.com |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111083303/http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament.

For each [[Eagle (golf)|eagle]] a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/golf/2017/04/10/masters-style-green-jacket-bought-for-5-at-toronto-thrift-store-sells-for-139k.html |title=Masters-style green jacket bought for $5 at Toronto thrift store sells for $139K |newspaper=Toronto Star |agency=Associated Press |date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Trophies====\nWinners also have their names engraved on the actual silver Masters trophy.

In 1954, they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up.<ref name=\"Hist\"/>\n\nThe original trophy weighs over 130 pounds, and sits on a four-foot wide base. It resides permanently at Augusta National and depicts the clubhouse of the classic course. The replica, which is significantly smaller, stands just 6.5 inches tall and weighs 20 pounds. The champion and the runner-up both have their names engraved on the permanent trophy, solidifying themselves in golf history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2016/09/19/masters-trophy-facts-size-weight-history-97937 |title=The Masters Trophy facts: Size, weight, history and more |date=September 19, 2016 |website=GolfNewsNet.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Double Eagle trophy was introduced in 1967 when [[Bruce Devlin]] holed out for double eagle on number 8.

The event was established as part of an effort to help promote the sport of golf among youth; the winners of local qualifiers in different age groups advance to the national finals, which have been held at Augusta National on the Sunday immediately preceding the Masters. The driving and chipping portions of the event are held on the course's practice range, but the putting portion has been played on the course's 18th hole.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/inaugural-drive-chip-and-putt |title=Inaugural Drive, Chip and Putt Championship has juniors living Augusta National dreams |last=Hennessey |first=Stephen |magazine=Golf Digest |date=April 4, 2014 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2013/04/08/masters-augusta-national-drive-chip-and-putt-contest/2064565/ |title=Masters unveils drive, chip and putt contest |newspaper=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=April 8, 2013 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/22996264/drive-chip-putt-winners-crowned-augusta-national-ahead-masters |title=Drive, Chip & Putt winners crowned at Augusta |work=ESPN |first=Bob |last=Harig |date=Apr 1, 2018 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn April 4, 2018, prior to the 2018 tournament, new Augusta National chairman [[Fred Ridley]] announced that the club would host the [[Augusta National Women's Amateur]] beginning in 2019. The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in [[1935 Masters Tournament|1935]], which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]], and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.\n\n==Course==\nThe golf course was formerly a [[plant nursery]] and each hole is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.<ref name=nursbeaut/><br>\nThe course layout in [[2019 Masters Tournament|2019]]:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par\n|-\n|1||align=left|[[Tea Olive]]||445||4||rowspan=10| ||10||align=left|[[Camellia]]||495||4\n|-\n|2||align=left|[[Flowering dogwood|Pink Dogwood]]||575||5||11||align=left|[[White Dogwood]]||505||4\n|-\n|3||align=left|[[Peach|Flowering Peach]]||350||4||12||align=left|[[Forsythia|Golden Bell]]||155||3\n|-\n|4||align=left|[[Malus|Flowering Crab Apple]]||240||3||13||align=left|[[Azalea]]||510||5\n|-\n|5||align=left|[[Southern magnolia|Magnolia]]||495||4||14||align=left|[[Cunninghamia|Chinese Fir]]||440||4\n|-\n|6||align=left|[[Eastern Juniper|Juniper]]||180||3||15||align=left|[[Pyracantha|Firethorn]]||530||5\n|-\n|7||align=left|[[Cortaderia selloana|Pampas]]||450||4||16||align=left|[[Eastern Redbud|Redbud]]||170||3\n|-\n|8||align=left|[[Yellow Jessamine|Yellow Jasmine]]||570||5||17||align=left|[[Nandina]]||440||4\n|-\n|9||align=left|[[Prunus caroliniana|Carolina Cherry]]||460||4||18||align=left|[[American holly|Holly]]||465||4\n|-\n| colspan=2|'''Out'''||'''3,765'''||'''36'''|| colspan=2|'''In'''||'''3,710'''||'''36'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|<small>Source:</small><ref name=itcpgat11/><ref name=2012cstour>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |publisher=PGA of America: Major Championships |title=Course Tour: 2012 Masters |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827230002/http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |archivedate=August 27, 2012 }}</ref>||colspan=2|'''Total'''||'''7,475'''||'''72'''\n|}\n\nLengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:\n{|\n|\n* [[2010 Masters Tournament|2010]]: {{convert|7435|yd}}\n* [[2000 Masters Tournament|2000]]: {{convert|6985|yd}}\n* [[1990 Masters Tournament|1990]]: {{convert|6905|yd}}\n* [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]]: {{convert|7040|yd|0}}\n|\n* [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1950 Masters Tournament|1950]]: {{convert|6900|yd|0}}\n* [[1940 Masters Tournament|1940]]: {{convert|6800|yd|0}}<ref name=itcpgat11/>\n|}\nThe course was lengthened to {{convert|7445|yd}} in [[2006 Masters Tournament|2006]].

From the 2011 Masters, [[Sky Sports]] began broadcasting all four days, as well as the par 3 contest in HD and, for the first time ever, in 3D. The BBC continued to air live coverage of the weekend rounds in parallel with Sky until 2019, when it was announced that Sky will hold exclusive rights to live coverage of all four rounds beginning 2020. The BBC will only hold rights to delayed highlights. With its loss of live rights to the Open Championship to Sky in 2016, it marks the first time since 1955 that the BBC no longer holds any rights to live professional golf.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/broadcasting/sky-sports-shuts-bbc-out-of-live-golf-with-masters-deal/5144895.article|title=Sky Sports shuts BBC out of live golf with Masters deal|last=Dams|first=Tim|website=Broadcast|language=en|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://insidersport.com/2019/11/20/sky-sports-lands-exclusive-live-uk-masters-rights-from-2020/|title=Sky Sports lands exclusive live UK Masters rights from 2020|last=Streeter|first=Joe|date=2019-11-20|website=Insider Sport|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/sky-seizes-share-of-the-masters-from-bbc-2085608.html |location=London |newspaper=The Independent |first=James |last=Corrigan |title=Sky seizes share of the Masters from BBC |date=September 22, 2010}}</ref>  \n\nIn Ireland, [[Setanta Sports|Setanta Ireland]] previously showed all four rounds, and now since 2017 [[Eir Sport]] broadcast all four rounds live having previously broadcast the opening two rounds with [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] broadcasting the weekend coverage.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/we-are-fully-committed-to-providing-a-public-service--without-public-funding-1241227.html |title=We are fully committed to providing a public service \u2013 without public funding |date=August 12, 2007 |newspaper=Irish Independent |accessdate=December 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Canada]], broadcast rights to the Masters are held by [[Bell Media]], with coverage divided between [[The Sports Network|TSN]] (cable), which carries live simulcasts and primetime encores of CBS and ESPN coverage for all four rounds, [[CTV Television|CTV]] (broadcast), which simulcasts CBS's coverage of the weekend rounds, and [[R\u00e9seau des sports|RDS]], which carries French-language coverage.

This was an unusual arrangement in Canadian sports broadcasting, as in most cases broadcasters acquire their rights directly from the event organizers or through partnerships with international rightsholders, such as [[ESPN International]] (ESPN owns a minority stake in TSN). In 2013, Global and TSN began selling advertising directly, and co-produced supplemental programs covering the tournament (while still carrying U.S. coverage for the tournament itself).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mediaincanada.com/2013/04/10/tsn-and-global-partner-to-sell-the-masters/ |title=TSN and Global partner to sell The Masters |work=Media in Canada |first=Val |last=Maloney |date=April 10, 2013 |accessdate=April 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bellmediapr.ca/tsn/releases/release.asp?id=16323&yyyy=2013 |title=TSN and Global Partner to Give Canadians Complete Coverage of The Masters |author=[[The Sports Network]] and [[Global Television Network]] |date=April 5, 2013 |accessdate=April 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 15, 2015, TSN parent company Bell Media announced that it had acquired exclusive Canadian rights to the tournament beginning 2016 under a multi-year deal.

Even the practice rounds can be difficult to get into. Applications for practice round tickets have to be made nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot. Tickets to the actual tournament are sold only to members of a patrons list, which is closed. A waiting list for the patrons list was opened in 1972 and closed in 1978. It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again. In 2008, the Masters also began allowing children (between the ages of 8 and 16) to enter on tournament days free if they are accompanied by the patron who is the owner of his or her badge.<ref name=tickets>{{cite web|url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/about/ticket.html |publisher=Masters.org |title=Ticket Information |accessdate=April 12, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410081216/http://www.masters.org/en_US/about/ticket.html |archivedate=April 10, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe difficulty in acquiring Masters badges has made the tournament one of the largest events on the secondary-ticket market.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 43609580|last1 = Deloca|first1 = Paul J.|title = Reviewed work: The Masters: Golf Money and Power in Augusta, Georgia, Curt Sampson|journal = Journal of Sport History|volume = 27|issue = 2|pages = 333\u2013335|year = 2000}}</ref> A majority of the badges for the Masters are delivered to the same group of patrons, fans, and members each year, and these perennial ticket holders sometimes decide to sell their badges through large ticket marketplaces such as StubHub, TicketCity, and VividSeats.

Recorded at [[Henson Recording Studios]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]] with producer [[Brendan O'Brien (record producer)|Brendan O'Brien]], it was released on 19 February 2016 by [[Universal Music Enterprises]]. The album was preceded by the release of the title track \"[[Victorious (Wolfmother song)|Victorious]]\" as a [[Single (music)|single]], which reached number 26 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart.\n\nWolfmother frontman [[Andrew Stockdale]] began work on ''Victorious'' after promoting the band's third album ''[[New Crown]]'' throughout 2014. He wrote all songs on the album and performed all vocals, guitars and bass, with regular bassist [[Ian Peres]] contributing keyboards only. Drums were recorded by guest contributors [[Josh Freese]] and [[Joey Waronker]], while O'Brien performed additional instrumental parts.\n\n''Victorious'' received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Many commentators hailed the album as a \"return to form\" for the band following numerous lineup changes and the low-key independent release of ''New Crown'', although others criticised it as merely derivative of the band's influences. The album was commercially successful, reaching the top 40 in several territories including Australia and the UK.\n\n==Recording and production==\nWolfmother frontman [[Andrew Stockdale]] began working on the follow-up to 2014's ''[[New Crown]]'' in January 2015 at a studio in [[New South Wales]], writing songs on guitar, bass and drums as he had done previously with the band's [[Wolfmother (album)|2005 self-titled album]].<ref name=\"axs\">{{cite news |url=http://www.axs.com/wolfmother-announces-new-album-victorious-and-2016-tour-70552 |title=Wolfmother announces new album, 'Victorious' and 2016 tour |last=Stingley |first=Mick |work=[[AXS (ticket merchant)|AXS]] |publisher=[[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] |date=20 November 2015 |accessdate=12 February 2016 }}</ref> Speaking about the writing process, Stockdale explained that \"Back in the early days, I'd play guitar, bass, and drums and then present the ideas to the band and we'd work on the arrangement together\", which he claimed is \"a good way to do things because it can make the style more cohesive.\"<ref name=\"axs\"/> Two of the earliest tracks written for the album were \"The Love That You Give\" and \"Pretty Peggy\", the latter of which was completed in approximately an hour.<ref name=\"loudwire\">{{cite magazine |url=http://loudwire.com/wolfmother-andrew-stockdale-victorious-album-north-american-tour-dates/ |title=Wolfmother's Andrew Stockdale Talks 'Victorious' Album, Reveals North American Tour Dates |last=Childers |first=Chad |magazine=[[Loudwire]] |date=20 November 2015 |accessdate=20 November 2015 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Josh_Freese_at_the_DEVO,_Boston_6-27-08.jpg|thumb|left|[[Josh Freese]] performed drums on all but three of the album's tracks.]]\nRecording for ''Victorious'' took place at [[Henson Recording Studios]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]], with production led by [[Brendan O'Brien (record producer)|Brendan O'Brien]].<ref name=\"billboard\">{{cite news |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/6769305/wolfmother-interview-victorious-andrew-stockdale-new-album-2016 |title=New Wolfmother!

Having spent the majority of his career at [[Real Madrid]], Casillas is one of the few players to achieve over [[List of footballers with the most official appearances|1000 professional career matches]], and holds the record for the most clean sheets in the [[UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions league]], as well as for the [[Spain national football team|Spanish national team]].\n\nAt club level, Casillas started his career with the [[Real Madrid CF (youth)|Real Madrid youth team]], eventually gaining promotion to the main team in 1999, where he became the youngest goalkeeper to play in the final of the Champions league, and to win the title, at 19 years and four days. Casillas became the first choice goalkeeper at Real Madrid, winning 2 champions leagues and la Liga titles in his first three seasons, establishing himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the world. During his highly successful career in Madrid, Casillas won all major club titles, including five [[La Liga]] titles, four [[Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a]] titles, two [[Copa del Rey]] titles, three [[UEFA Champions League|Champions leagues]], two [[UEFA Super Cup]]s, one [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] and the [[FIFA Club World Cup]].

While at Porto, he broke the record for most consecutive seasons played in the champions league (20) and amassed the most appearances in the competition (177).\n\nWith 167 international caps, Casillas has the second most appearances for the Spanish national team, making him the joint tenth-[[List of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps|most capped footballer of all time]]. Becoming the nation's first choice goalkeeper at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], Casillas went on to play at [[UEFA Euro 2004]] and the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. In 2008, he was made [[List of Spain national football captains|captain]], and led the team to that year's [[UEFA Euro 2008|European Championship]]. Casillas also led Spain to their first [[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Cup win in 2010]], where he kept a record five clean sheets, winning the [[Yashin Award]] for best goalkeeper of the tournament. Spain became the first nation to retain the European Championship, winning again in [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]], where he set the record for [[List of UEFA European Championship records and statistics|most consecutive minutes without conceding a goal]] in the competition (509). In 2014, Casillas became one of four players to [[List of players who have appeared in multiple FIFA World Cups|represent Spain at four World Cups]].\n\nIn 2008, Casillas placed Fourth overall in the [[Ballon d'Or]], and has been selected for the [[UEFA Team of the Year|UEFA Team of the year]] six consecutive times from 2007 to 2012, a record for a goalkeeper. Casillas was also selected in the [[FIFPro World XI|FIFPro world XI]] a record 5 times for a goalkeeper, and was named as the [[IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper]] a record 5 times, alongside [[Gianluigi Buffon]].

Casillas became the first choice goalkeeper at Real Madrid, winning 2 champions leagues and la Liga titles in his first three seasons, establishing himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the world. During his highly successful career in Madrid, Casillas won all major club titles, including five [[La Liga]] titles, four [[Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a]] titles, two [[Copa del Rey]] titles, three [[UEFA Champions League|Champions leagues]], two [[UEFA Super Cup]]s, one [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] and the [[FIFA Club World Cup]].

While at Porto, he broke the record for most consecutive seasons played in the champions league (20) and amassed the most appearances in the competition (177).\n\nWith 167 international caps, Casillas has the second most appearances for the Spanish national team, making him the joint tenth-[[List of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps|most capped footballer of all time]]. Becoming the nation's first choice goalkeeper at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], Casillas went on to play at [[UEFA Euro 2004]] and the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. In 2008, he was made [[List of Spain national football captains|captain]], and led the team to that year's [[UEFA Euro 2008|European Championship]]. Casillas also led Spain to their first [[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Cup win in 2010]], where he kept a record five clean sheets, winning the [[Yashin Award]] for best goalkeeper of the tournament. Spain became the first nation to retain the European Championship, winning again in [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]], where he set the record for [[List of UEFA European Championship records and statistics|most consecutive minutes without conceding a goal]] in the competition (509). In 2014, Casillas became one of four players to [[List of players who have appeared in multiple FIFA World Cups|represent Spain at four World Cups]].\n\nIn 2008, Casillas placed Fourth overall in the [[Ballon d'Or]], and has been selected for the [[UEFA Team of the Year|UEFA Team of the year]] six consecutive times from 2007 to 2012, a record for a goalkeeper.

Chu]], from a screenplay by Peter Chiarelli and [[Adele Lim]], based on the [[Crazy Rich Asians|2013 novel of the same title]] by [[Kevin Kwan]]. The film stars [[Constance Wu]], [[Henry Golding]], [[Gemma Chan]], [[Lisa Lu]], [[Awkwafina]], [[Ken Jeong]], and [[Michelle Yeoh]]. It follows a [[Chinese Americans|Chinese-American]] professor who travels to meet her boyfriend's family and is surprised to discover they are among the richest in [[Singapore]].\n\nThe film was announced in August 2013 after the rights to the book were purchased. Many of the cast members signed on in the spring of 2017, and filming took place from April to June of that year in parts of [[New York City]] and [[Singapore]]. It is the first film by a [[major film studio|major Hollywood studio]] to feature a majority cast of Asian descent in a modern setting since ''[[The Joy Luck Club (film)|The Joy Luck Club]]'' in 1993.<!--(Memoirs of a Geisha was a period piece)--> Despite praise for that, the film did receive some criticism for casting [[biracial]] actors over [[Overseas Chinese|fully ethnically Chinese]] ones in certain roles. Additional criticism was directed at the film for failing to include non-Chinese Singaporean ethnic groups\u2014notably [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Indian people|Indian]] actors\u2014as characters.\n\n''Crazy Rich Asians'' premiered on August 7, 2018, at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]] and was released theatrically in the United States on August 15, 2018, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its acting, production and costume design. The film grossed over $238 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing romantic comedy in a decade. The film received numerous accolades, including the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] earning nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]] for Wu. It also received four nominations at the [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]], winning one for [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Comedy|Best Comedy]], and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]] at the [[25th Screen Actors Guild Awards]]. Two sequels, based on the novel's follow-ups ''[[China Rich Girlfriend]]'' and ''[[Rich People Problems]]'', are currently in development.\n\n==Plot==\nNick Young and his girlfriend Rachel Chu, an [[economics]] professor at [[New York University]] and [[New York City|New York]] native, travel to [[Singapore]] for the wedding of his best friend Colin, who is marrying Araminta Lee. In Singapore, Rachel visits her college friend Peik Lin and her family, who are shocked when she tells them she is dating Nick Young. Peik Lin reveals that Nick's family is extremely wealthy and famous, and are members of high society. At a dinner party at the Young estate, Nick introduces Rachel to his mother Eleanor, while his cousin Astrid discovers that her husband Michael, who comes from a more humble background than the Youngs, has been having an affair. Rachel senses that Eleanor dislikes her.\n\nAt Araminta's [[bachelorette party]], Rachel meets Amanda, who reveals she is Nick's former girlfriend and hints Rachel may not be able to integrate into such a high-class family with her lower background. Rachel finds her hotel room vandalized by the other girls, who deem her a gold-digger, but is comforted by Astrid. Nick attends Colin's [[bachelor party]], where he reveals to Colin his plan to propose to Rachel. Colin expresses his concern about the trouble it will cause them, especially with Nick being expected to stay in Singapore and run his family's corporation and Rachel loving her job in New York, as well as the difference in their statuses. Nick apologizes to Rachel for not telling her who he really was and takes her to make [[jiaozi]] dumplings with his family. Here, Eleanor recounts the sacrifices she made to become a part of the Young family and makes jabs at Rachel for her American background. Eleanor later privately recounts to Rachel how Nick's father had to cast his own green ring to propose to her as Nick's grandmother refused to give him the family ring, owing to Eleanor not being the first or even second choice. She tells Rachel that she will never be enough for Nick or his family. Peik Lin convinces Rachel to stand up to Eleanor and earns her respect. On the day of the wedding, Astrid confronts Michael about his affair; Michael blames his unhappiness and the great financial disparity between them on her.\n\nDuring the wedding reception, Eleanor and Nick's grandmother privately confront Rachel and Nick. Using the findings of a private investigation, Eleanor reveals that Rachel's father is alive, and Rachel was conceived through an adulterous affair, after which her mother, Kerry, abandoned her husband and fled to the United States. They demand that Nick stop seeing Rachel for fear of a scandal, as they cannot be linked to such a family. Rachel is stunned, as Kerry told her that her father was dead. She flees and stays at Peik Lin's home, depressed and unwilling to speak to Nick. Kerry arrives in Singapore, explaining that her husband was abusive and that the comfort an old classmate provided turned into love and a surprise pregnancy. She fled with baby Rachel in fear that her husband would kill them. Kerry reveals that Nick was the one who had called her to Singapore and urges Rachel to talk to him. When they meet, Nick apologizes and proposes to Rachel, saying that he is willing to leave his family behind to be with her.\n\nRachel arranges to meet Eleanor at a [[mahjong]] parlor. Over a game of mahjong, she reveals to Eleanor that she declined Nick's proposal so his relationship with his family would not be ruined. She tells Eleanor to remember that when Nick eventually marries someone \"good enough\" for her, it will be because of a selfless act on the part of Rachel, a girl Eleanor looks down upon. Meanwhile, Astrid moves out, telling Michael his ego, insecurities, and unwillingness to make their marriage work caused it to fail. Elsewhere Eleanor has a meeting with Nick.\n\nRachel and Kerry board a flight back to New York City at [[Singapore Changi Airport]], but are interrupted by Nick, who proposes with Eleanor's green ring, revealing her blessing. In tears, Rachel accepts and they stay in Singapore one more night for an engagement party, where Eleanor nods at Rachel in acknowledgment, Rachel having finally earned her respect. In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Astrid and her ex-boyfriend Charlie Wu spot each other at the party; she discreetly smiles.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple

Chu]], from a screenplay by Peter Chiarelli and [[Adele Lim]], based on the [[Crazy Rich Asians|2013 novel of the same title]] by [[Kevin Kwan]]. The film stars [[Constance Wu]], [[Henry Golding]], [[Gemma Chan]], [[Lisa Lu]], [[Awkwafina]], [[Ken Jeong]], and [[Michelle Yeoh]]. It follows a [[Chinese Americans|Chinese-American]] professor who travels to meet her boyfriend's family and is surprised to discover they are among the richest in [[Singapore]].\n\nThe film was announced in August 2013 after the rights to the book were purchased. Many of the cast members signed on in the spring of 2017, and filming took place from April to June of that year in parts of [[New York City]], and [[Singapore]]. It is the first film by a [[major film studio|major Hollywood studio]] to feature a majority cast of Asian descent in a modern setting since ''[[The Joy Luck Club (film)|The Joy Luck Club]]'' in 1993.<!--(Memoirs of a Geisha was a period piece)--> Despite praise for that, the film did receive some criticism for casting [[biracial]] actors over [[Overseas Chinese|fully ethnically Chinese]] ones in certain roles. Additional criticism was directed at the film for failing to include non-Chinese Singaporean ethnic groups\u2014notably [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Indian people|Indian]] actors\u2014as characters.\n\n''Crazy Rich Asians'' premiered on August 7, 2018, at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre]] in [[Los Angeles]] and was released theatrically in the United States on August 15, 2018, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its acting, production and costume design. The film grossed over $238 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing romantic comedy in a decade. The film received numerous accolades, including the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] earning nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]] for Wu. It also received four nominations at the [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]], winning one for [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Comedy|Best Comedy]], and a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]] at the [[25th Screen Actors Guild Awards]]. Two sequels, based on the novel's follow-ups ''[[China Rich Girlfriend]]'' and ''[[Rich People Problems]]'', are currently in development.\n\n==Plot==\nNick Young and his girlfriend Rachel Chu, an [[economics]] professor at [[New York University]] and [[New York City|New York]] native, travel to [[Singapore]] for the wedding of his best friend Colin, who is marrying Araminta Lee. In Singapore, Rachel visits her college friend Peik Lin and her family, who are shocked when she tells them she is dating Nick Young. Peik Lin reveals that Nick's family is extremely wealthy and famous, and are members of high society. At a dinner party at the Young estate, Nick introduces Rachel to his mother Eleanor, while his cousin Astrid discovers that her husband Michael, who comes from a more humble background than the Youngs, has been having an affair. Rachel senses that Eleanor dislikes her.\n\nAt Araminta's [[bachelorette party]], Rachel meets Amanda, who reveals she is Nick's former girlfriend and hints Rachel may not be able to integrate into such a high-class family with her lower background. Rachel finds her hotel room vandalized by the other girls, who deem her a gold-digger, but is comforted by Astrid. Nick attends Colin's [[bachelor party]], where he reveals to Colin his plan to propose to Rachel. Colin expresses his concern about the trouble it will cause them, especially with Nick being expected to stay in Singapore and run his family's corporation and Rachel loving her job in New York, as well as the difference in their statuses. Nick apologizes to Rachel for not telling her who he really was and takes her to make [[jiaozi]] dumplings with his family. Here, Eleanor recounts the sacrifices she made to become a part of the Young family and makes jabs at Rachel for her American background. Eleanor later privately recounts to Rachel how Nick's father had to cast his own green ring to propose to her as Nick's grandmother refused to give him the family ring, owing to Eleanor not being the first or even second choice. She tells Rachel that she will never be enough for Nick or his family. Peik Lin convinces Rachel to stand up to Eleanor and earns her respect. On the day of the wedding, Astrid confronts Michael about his affair; Michael blames his unhappiness and the great financial disparity between them on her.\n\nDuring the wedding reception, Eleanor and Nick's grandmother privately confront Rachel and Nick. Using the findings of a private investigation, Eleanor reveals that Rachel's father is alive, and Rachel was conceived through an adulterous affair, after which her mother, Kerry, abandoned her husband and fled to the United States. They demand that Nick stop seeing Rachel for fear of a scandal, as they cannot be linked to such a family. Rachel is stunned, as Kerry told her that her father was dead. She flees and stays at Peik Lin's home, depressed and unwilling to speak to Nick. Kerry arrives in Singapore, explaining that her husband was abusive and that the comfort an old classmate provided turned into love and a surprise pregnancy. She fled with baby Rachel in fear that her husband would kill them. Kerry reveals that Nick was the one who had called her to Singapore and urges Rachel to talk to him. When they meet, Nick apologizes and proposes to Rachel, saying that he is willing to leave his family behind to be with her.\n\nRachel arranges to meet Eleanor at a [[mahjong]] parlor. Over a game of mahjong, she reveals to Eleanor that she declined Nick's proposal so his relationship with his family would not be ruined. She tells Eleanor to remember that when Nick eventually marries someone \"good enough\" for her, it will be because of a selfless act on the part of Rachel, a girl Eleanor looks down upon. Meanwhile, Astrid moves out, telling Michael his ego, insecurities, and unwillingness to make their marriage work caused it to fail. Elsewhere Eleanor has a meeting with Nick.\n\nRachel and Kerry board a flight back to New York City at [[Singapore Changi Airport]], but are interrupted by Nick, who proposes with Eleanor's green ring, revealing her blessing. In tears, Rachel accepts and they stay in Singapore one more night for an engagement party, where Eleanor nods at Rachel in acknowledgment, Rachel having finally earned her respect. In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Astrid and her ex-boyfriend Charlie Wu spot each other at the party; she discreetly smiles.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple
