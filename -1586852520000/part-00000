It was intended to be a romantic allegorical account of Maximilian's own participation in a series of [[Tournament (medieval)|jousting tournaments]] in the guise of the tale's eponymous hero, Freydal. In the story, Freydal takes part in the tournaments to prove that he is worthy to marry a princess, who is a fictionalised representation of Maximilian's late wife, [[Mary of Burgundy]].\n\nThe text was never completed, although a manuscript draft is held by the [[Austrian National Library]]. 256 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] to accompany the text were created by court painters, and 255 are preserved in an [[illuminated manuscript]] \u2018tournament book\u2019 held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. These miniatures vividly record the different types of jousts that were popular at the time as well as the [[Masquerade ball|court masquerades]], or \u2018mummeries\u2019, that took place at the end of the day after each tournament. It is the most extensive visual record of late medieval tournaments and court masquerades that exists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1519.]]\n[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and his father [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] were part of what was to become a long line of [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]]. Maximilian was elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1486; upon his father's death in 1493 he succeeded to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=303}}</ref>\n\nDuring his reign, Maximilian commissioned a number of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars and artists to assist him in completing a series of projects, in different art forms, intended to immortalize his life and deeds and those of his Habsburg ancestors.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\">{{harvnb| Watanabe-O'Kelly|2000|p=94}}</ref> He referred to these projects as ''Gedechtnus'' (\"memorial\"),<ref name=\"Kleinschmidt162\">{{harvnb|Kleinschmidt|2008|p=162}}</ref> and included a series of stylised autobiographical works: ''Freydal'', the prose romance ''[[Weisskunig]]'', and the poem ''[[Theuerdank]]''.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\"/>\n\n''Freydal'' and ''Theuerdank'' are closely linked and together give an allegorical account of the events leading to Maximilian's marriage to [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1477.<ref name=moma120>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=120}}</ref> Mary died five years later, in 1482.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=300}}</ref> In ''Freydal'', which is partly a tribute to Mary,<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\">{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88}}</ref> the eponymous hero pursues his fair lady by [[jousting]] in [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]].<ref name=Freeman>{{harvnb|Freeman|2019}}</ref> ''Theuerdank'' is effectively a sequel in which the hero overcomes dangers on the journey to his wedding.<ref name=moma120/> ''Freydal'' has a comedic tone which contrasts with ''Theuerdank'', which has more of the character of a tragedy.<ref name=McLaren/>\n\nThe theme of ''Freydal'' reflects Maximilian's lifelong enthusiasm for jousting.

The narrative ends with Freydal setting out to search for her, and ''Theuerdank'' then takes up the subsequent story.<ref name=moma121/>\n\nThe work reflects Maximilian's vanity, as exemplified by a poem which forms part of the draft text:<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\"/>{{Quotation|This did the gallant Freydal<br>In knightly deeds of fame<br>Thus rendering illustrious<br>The glories of his name.<br>His virtues and his goodness<br>Are manifest to all;<br>His many glorious triumphs<br>At tilt, at masks and ball...<br>His like will ne\u2019er be seen again.<ref>translation {{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88, note 1}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, the tournaments described are based on encounters Maximilian actually had.

This results in a spectacular splintering of the lances. In the ''Scharfrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields) the shield is shown loosely fixed to the rider's breastplate, the aim being to dislodge it. In contrast, the objective of the ''Antzogenrennen'' is to unseat the opponent and his shield is fixed to his armour.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Feldrennen'' (or ''Kampfrennen'') jousts replicate skirmishes in war and the riders wear battlefield armour. The rarest type of joust depicted is the ''Kr\u00f6nlrennen'' where one rider wears the armour of a joust of peace but wields the lance of a joust of war and the other rider  has the opposite combination.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nOne of the most spectacular jousts depicted is the ''Bundrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields without [[bevors]])<ref name=moma121/> and its variation, ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' (joust of war with flying and exploding shields).<ref name=moma125>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=125}}</ref> In the ''Bundrennen'', the shield is held in place on the rider's breastplate with a complicated spring mechanism and when it is struck in the right place by the opponent it is ejected high into the air.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' increases the spectacle by attaching multiple triangular platelets to the shield which, when the shield is ejected, come loose and explode into the air like a firework display.<ref name=moma125/> Maximilian claimed to have invented this type of joust.<ref name=Freeman/> \n[[File:Freydal 05.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Foot combat between Freydal and Claude de Vaudry (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 39, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=moma120/>]]\nIn each of the tournaments, the participants are shown engaging in a foot combat.

Not only is it the largest surviving tournament book, it is also an unparalleled pictorial source of jousting from the late medieval period.<ref>{{harv|Terjanian|2019|pp=120-121}}</ref> It is the only one to depict spectacular falls.<ref name=Freeman/> In addition to illustrating the jousts themselves, it represents a remarkable catalogue of the weaponry used during tournaments<ref name=Freeman/> and is the most extensive record of mummery, the early court masquerade, that exists.<ref name=moma122/> The manuscript has been recognised in [[UNESCO]]\u2019s [[Memory of the World Programme]].<ref>{{harv|Taschen Catalogue}}</ref>\n\nHowever, ''Freydal'' was intended to be not only an artistic work but also political propaganda.<ref>{{harv|Barber|1974|p=298}}</ref> As part of what he called his \u2018memorial projects\u2019 or ''Gedechtnus'', Maximilian I used literary and visual works such as ''Freydal'' to model and enhance his public image. His aim was to make up for his actual powerlessness and lack of centralised control over his own realms by presenting himself and his exploits as superior to any others.<ref name=muller>{{harv| M\u00fcller|2003|pp=307-308}}</ref> As the historian [[Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller]] ([[:de:Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller |de]]) has said, the extent to which Maximilian employed this strategy meant that his court

It was intended to be a romantic allegorical account of Maximilian's own participation in a series of [[Tournament (medieval)|jousting tournaments]] in the guise of the tale's eponymous hero, Freydal. In the story, Freydal takes part in the tournaments to prove that he is worthy to marry a princess, who is a fictionalised representation of Maximilian's late wife, [[Mary of Burgundy]].\n\nThe text was never completed, although a manuscript draft is held by the [[Austrian National Library]]. 256 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] to accompany the text were created by court painters, and 255 are preserved in an [[illuminated manuscript]] \u2018tournament book\u2019 held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. These miniatures vividly record the different types of jousts that were popular at the time as well as the [[Masquerade ball|court masquerades]], or \u2018mummeries\u2019, that took place at the end of the day after each tournament. It is the most extensive visual record of late medieval tournaments and court masquerades that exists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1519.]]\n[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and his father [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] were part of what was to become a long line of [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]]. Maximilian was elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1486; upon his father's death in 1493 he succeeded to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=303}}</ref>\n\nDuring his reign, Maximilian commissioned a number of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars and artists to assist him in completing a series of projects, in different art forms, intended to immortalize his life and deeds and those of his Habsburg ancestors.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\">{{harvnb| Watanabe-O'Kelly|2000|p=94}}</ref> He referred to these projects as ''Gedechtnus'' (\"memorial\"),<ref name=\"Kleinschmidt162\">{{harvnb|Kleinschmidt|2008|p=162}}</ref> and included a series of stylised autobiographical works: ''Freydal'', the prose romance ''[[Weisskunig]]'', and the poem ''[[Theuerdank]]''.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\"/>\n\n''Freydal'' and ''Theuerdank'' are closely linked and together give an allegorical account of the events leading to Maximilian's marriage to [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1477.<ref name=moma120>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=120}}</ref> Mary died five years later, in 1482.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=300}}</ref> In ''Freydal'', which is partly a tribute to Mary,<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\">{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88}}</ref> the eponymous hero pursues his fair lady by [[jousting]] in [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]].<ref name=Freeman>{{harvnb|Freeman|2019}}</ref> ''Theuerdank'' is effectively a sequel in which the hero overcomes dangers on the journey to his wedding.<ref name=moma120/> ''Freydal'' has a comedic tone which contrasts with ''Theuerdank'', which has more of the character of a tragedy.<ref name=McLaren/>\n\nThe theme of ''Freydal'' reflects Maximilian's lifelong enthusiasm for jousting. He attended his first tournament at the age of 14 and was captivated by its traditions and spectacle.<ref name=Freeman/> He staged many tournaments, including those to celebrate his wedding to Mary of Burgundy in 1477, his coronation as King of the Romans in 1486 and on the occasion of the [[First Congress of Vienna]] in 1515.<ref name=Freeman/> Maximilian was himself a participant in tournaments from 1485 until 1511, when he was in his 50s.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}</ref> His affinity for jousting contributed to his [[soubriquet]] the \u201clast knight\u201d.<ref name=Freeman/>\n[[File:Freydal fol164.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Post-tournament festivities: grotesque-style dancers or mummers dance a [[moresca]] while Freydal, in a mask and holding torches, looks on (''Freydal'' ms. fol.164, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=Locke123/>]]\n\n==Creation and history==\nMaximilian appears to have begun planning ''Freydal'' in 1502.<ref name=moma123>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=123}}</ref> The name ''Freydal'' was derived from ''Freyd-alb'', meaning \"white joyful young man\".<ref>{{harvnb|Strobl|1913|p=4}}</ref> In that year, he instructed his court taylor, Martin Trummer \"to have drawn in a book all those costumes as yet seen in mummeries organised by his majesty\".<ref name=moma123/> A \u201cmummery\u201d was a late medieval courtly [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] or costumed dance.<ref name=moma122>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=122}}</ref>\n\nThis developed into the commissioning of planning sketches for the entire work, created over the next ten years.<ref name=moma123/> They were drawn in pen on [[laid paper]], using brown and black ink with watercolour over black chalk and leadpoint.<ref name=moma123/> A collection of 203 of these are housed in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|pp=120, 123}}</ref> A small number of additional drawings are held at the [[British Museum]] and the [[Vatican Library]].<ref name=moma123/>\n\nMaximilian took a leading part in the creation of the work.<ref name=Clephan87>{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=87}}</ref> His instructions on the subjects to be illustrated as well as corrections, in his own hand, of some of the proofs have survived.

The narrative ends with Freydal setting out to search for her, and ''Theuerdank'' then takes up the subsequent story.<ref name=moma121/>\n\nThe work reflects Maximilian's vanity, as exemplified by a poem which forms part of the draft text:<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\"/>{{Quotation|This did the gallant Freydal<br>In knightly deeds of fame<br>Thus rendering illustrious<br>The glories of his name.<br>His virtues and his goodness<br>Are manifest to all;<br>His many glorious triumphs<br>At tilt, at masks and ball...<br>His like will ne\u2019er be seen again.<ref>translation {{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88, note 1}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, the tournaments described are based on encounters Maximilian actually had.

This results in a spectacular splintering of the lances. In the ''Scharfrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields) the shield is shown loosely fixed to the rider's breastplate, the aim being to dislodge it. In contrast, the objective of the ''Antzogenrennen'' is to unseat the opponent and his shield is fixed to his armour.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Feldrennen'' (or ''Kampfrennen'') jousts replicate skirmishes in war and the riders wear battlefield armour. The rarest type of joust depicted is the ''Kr\u00f6nlrennen'' where one rider wears the armour of a joust of peace but wields the lance of a joust of war and the other rider  has the opposite combination.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nOne of the most spectacular jousts depicted is the ''Bundrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields without [[bevors]])<ref name=moma121/> and its variation, ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' (joust of war with flying and exploding shields).<ref name=moma125>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=125}}</ref> In the ''Bundrennen'', the shield is held in place on the rider's breastplate with a complicated spring mechanism and when it is struck in the right place by the opponent it is ejected high into the air.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' increases the spectacle by attaching multiple triangular platelets to the shield which, when the shield is ejected, come loose and explode into the air like a firework display.<ref name=moma125/> Maximilian claimed to have invented this type of joust.<ref name=Freeman/> \n[[File:Freydal 05.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Foot combat between Freydal and Claude de Vaudry (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 39, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=moma120/>]]\nIn each of the tournaments, the participants are shown engaging in a foot combat. A variety of weapons are used, including [[Mace (bludgeon)|iron clubs]] (''Eisenkolben''), [[Flail (weapon)|flails]] (''Drischel''), swords (''Turnierschwert'')<ref name=krause179>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|p=179}}</ref> and daggers.<ref name=krause181>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|p=181}}</ref> The ''[[Melee (tournament)|m\u00eal\u00e9e]]'' is also shown in the manuscript.<ref name=Clephan87/>\n\nAfter each of the sixty-four tournaments is a scene depicting a [[moresca]] (a pantomime dance) or other post-tournament festivities with male courtiers, including the knights who had competed in the tournament, dressing up to dance in a variety of exotic costumes.<ref name=Locke121/> Known as \u2018mummeries\u2019, these were a regular feature of the evening entertainment after tournaments.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nThe male courtiers in the mummeries in the manuscript dress up, amongst other things, in costumes based on nationality or ethnicity, for example [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] or [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] costume, or as animals such as [[apes]] and creatures with bird's heads.<ref name=Locke121/> In one masquerade illustrated, the male participants engage in [[cross-dressing]] and wear women's gowns.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nIn each scene, all the men are dressed in the same costume and normally wear a mask.

Not only is it the largest surviving tournament book, it is also an unparalleled pictorial source of jousting from the late medieval period.<ref>{{harv|Terjanian|2019|pp=120-121}}</ref> It is the only one to depict spectacular falls.<ref name=Freeman/> In addition to illustrating the jousts themselves, it represents a remarkable catalogue of the weaponry used during tournaments<ref name=Freeman/> and is the most extensive record of mummery, the early court masquerade, that exists.<ref name=moma122/> The manuscript has been recognised in [[UNESCO]]\u2019s [[Memory of the World]] programme.<ref>{{harv|Taschen Catalogue}}</ref>\n\nHowever, ''Freydal'' was intended to be not only an artistic work but also political propaganda.<ref>{{harv|Barber|1974|p=298}}</ref> As part of what he called his \u2018memorial projects\u2019 or ''Gedechtnus'', Maximilian I used literary and visual works such as ''Freydal'' to model and enhance his public image. His aim was to make up for his actual powerlessness and lack of centralised control over his own realms by presenting himself and his exploits as superior to any others.<ref name=muller>{{harv| M\u00fcller|2003|pp=307-308}}</ref> As the historian [[Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller]] ([[:de:Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller |de]]) has said, the extent to which Maximilian employed this strategy meant that his court

When the elderly population is compared with young adults, the excess hazard ratio (a hazard ratio that is corrected for differences in mortality across age groups) decreases from 10.15 to 1.85 at 1 to 3 years, meaning that the elderly population are much more likely to die in the first year post-diagnosis when compared to young adults (aged 15 to 40), but after three years, this difference is reduced markedly.<ref name=\"smoll 2014\" /> \nTypical median survival for anaplastic astrocytoma is 2\u20133 years.  Secondary progression to glioblastoma multiforme is common.

Most cases of paralysis and speech difficulties can be rehabilitated with speech, occupational, physical, and vision therapy.\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe age-standardized 5-year relative survival rate is 23.6%.<ref name=\"smoll 2014\">{{cite journal | title=Incidence and relative survival of anaplastic astrocytomas |vauthors=Smoll NR, Hamilton B | journal=Neuro-Oncology | year=2014 | volume=0 |issue=10 | pages=1\u20138 | doi=10.1093/neuonc/nou053|pmid=24723565 | pmc=4165416 }}</ref> Patients with this tumor are 46 times more likely to die than matched members of the general population.<ref name=\"smoll 2014\" /> It is important to note that prognosis across age groups is different especially during the first three years post-diagnosis. When the elderly population is compared with young adults, the excess hazard ratio (a hazard ratio that is corrected for differences in mortality across age groups) decreases from 10.15 to 1.85 at 1 to 3 years, meaning that the elderly population are much more likely to die in the first year post-diagnosis when compared to young adults (aged 15 to 40), but after three years, this difference is reduced markedly.<ref name=\"smoll 2014\" /> \nTypical median survival for anaplastic astrocytoma is 2\u20133 years.  Secondary progression to glioblastoma multiforme is common. Radiation, younger age, female sex, treatment after 2000, and surgery were associated with improved survival in AA patients.<ref>Nu\u00f1o M, Birch K, Mukherjee D, Sarmiento JM, Black KL, Patil CG.

The Golden Bears have won three [[Vanier Cup]] national championships, in 1967, 1972 and most recently in 1980. The program has also won 18 [[Hardy Trophy|Hardy Cup]] conference titles, second only to the [[Saskatchewan Huskies]] who have won 19 of them. The Golden Bears have also had three players win the [[Hec Crighton Trophy]], with Mel Smith winning in 1971, Bryan Fryer winning in 1975, and most recently Ed Ilnicki winning the award in [[2017 U Sports football season|2017]].\n\n== Awards and standings ==\nThe Bears are considered a strong school team in Canada in multiple sports.  The hockey and volleyball teams, in particular, are frequent challengers in [[U Sports]] national championships.\n\nThe hockey team has won a total of 15 National Championships and 25 Canada West championships, having won 5 National Championships (04-05, 05\u201306, 07\u201308, 13\u201314, 14\u201315) and 13 Canada West championships in the past 15 seasons.\n\nThe volleyball team has been strong over the past decade, having been crowned National Champions on four occasions: 2008, 2009, 2014, and 2015. In addition, they were runners-up in 2006 and 2007. They have also won the Canada West 13 times.\n\nIn addition to their success over Canadian competition, the Golden Bears host the annual Husky Energy Can-Am Challenge of Champions tournament, where they frequently spearhead the Canadian contingent's success. This tournament sees four top teams from both Canada and the USA competing for supremacy, with the Canadian teams holding the overall title, having won 9 of the 13 tournaments.\n\n=== Championships

The Golden Bears have won three [[Vanier Cup]] national championships, in 1967, 1972 and most recently in 1980. The program has also won 18 [[Hardy Trophy|Hardy Cup]] conference titles, second only to the [[Saskatchewan Huskies]] who have won 19 of them. The Golden Bears have also had three players win the [[Hec Crighton Trophy]], with Mel Smith winning in 1971, Bryan Fryer winning in 1975, and most recently Ed Ilnicki winning the award in [[2017 U Sports football season|2017]].\n\n== Awards and standings ==\nThe Bears are considered a strong school team in Canada in multiple sports.  The hockey and volleyball teams, in particular, are frequent challengers in [[U Sports]] national championships.\n\nThe hockey team has won a total of 15 National Championships and 25 Canada West championships, having won 5 National Championships (04-05, 05\u201306, 07\u201308, 13\u201314, 14\u201315) and 13 Canada West championships in the past 15 seasons.\n\nThe volleyball team has been strong over the past decade, having been crowned National Champions on four occasions: 2008, 2009, 2014, and 2015. In addition, they were runners-up in 2006 and 2007. They have also won the Canada West 13 times.\n\nIn addition to their success over Canadian competition, the Golden Bears host the annual Husky Energy Can-Am Challenge of Champions tournament, where they frequently spearhead the Canadian contingent's success. This tournament sees four top teams from both Canada and the USA competing for supremacy, with the Canadian teams holding the overall title, having won 9 of the 13 tournaments.\n\n=== Championships

Completed in 1887 under the name of Station Street (\u5dee\u9928\u8857),<ref name=\"Heritage Impact Assessment Report\" /> it was once the most prosperous street in Kowloon. It originates from the south at [[Austin Road]], and terminates in the north at [[Lai Chi Kok Road]]. Parallel to Shanghai Street are [[Nathan Road]], [[Temple Street, Hong Kong|Temple Street]], [[Portland Street]], [[Reclamation Street]] and [[Canton Road]]. Though parallel, Shanghai Street was marked by 2- to 3-floor Chinese-style buildings while Nathan Road was marked by Western-style buildings.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n==History==\n[[Image:Shang Hai Street in early 1900s.jpg|thumb|Shanghai Street in the early 1900s.]]\n[[Image:Shang Hai Street in 1960s.jpg|thumb|Shanghai Street in the 1960s.]]\n[[Image:Shanghai Street night clubs and sexual agencies.jpg|thumb|Hanging signs advertise the presence of sex industry venues mixed in with other shops and residential buildings.]]\n\nPrior to 1874 the land that Shanghai Street stands on was sea, making Shanghai Street an early example of [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|reclaimed land in Hong Kong]].\n\nThe street is not so named because of a [[Shanghainese people|Shanghainese]] population. Prior to being renamed Shanghai Street it was originally called Station Street (\u5dee\u9928\u8857). The reason being the presence of [[Yau Ma Tei Police Station]], a police station located at the junction of [[Public Square Street]] and Shanghai Street, until its relocation to No. 627 [[Canton Road]] in 1922. Since the police station was the landmark of the area, the street was named for it. On 12 November 1898, it was divided into two sections, Station Street South and Station Street North.\n\nThere are two reasons for the streets renaming. First, in 1909, the Government started to name streets in Kowloon after major Chinese provinces that traded with Hong Kong, to recognise Hong Kong as a commercial port. The British colonial government in Hong Kong found the area of Station Street was as prosperous as Shanghai in China at that time while Hong Kong was having trade relation with Shanghai. Therefore, they renamed ''Station street'' to ''Shanghai Street'' on 19 March 1909.<ref>[http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1909/11841.pdf ''The Hong Kong Government Gazette'', March 19, 1909]</ref> The second reason was that there was a street called Upper Station Street (\u5dee\u9928\u4e0a\u8857) in [[Sheung Wan]], in [[Hong Kong Island]] and it caused confusion with the one in Yau Ma Tei and Mong Kok.\n\nOne of the then two [[Magistrates' court (Hong Kong)|Magistrate's Courts]] of Kowloon was located in Shanghai Street between [[Public Square Street]] and Market Street, until it was demolished in 1957. The other one was the Kowloon Magistracy in [[Gascoigne Road]],<ref name=\"Resource Kit\">[http://www.heritage.gov.hk/en/doc/Resource%20kit_North_Kowloon_Magistracy.pdf Conserve and Revitalise Hong Kong Heritage \u2013 North Kowloon Magistracy \u2013 Resource Kit]</ref> built in 1936 and renamed the [[Old South Kowloon District Court|South Kowloon District Court]] in 1957.<ref>[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/Brief_Information_on_proposed_Grade_I_Items.pdf Antiquities and Monuments Office: Brief Information on Proposed Grade I Items, pp. 240\u2013241] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013023413/http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/Brief_Information_on_proposed_Grade_I_Items.pdf |date=13 October 2012 }}</ref> The [[North Kowloon Magistracy]], built in 1960 in [[Shek Kip Mei]], later shared the workload.\n\nBefore the 1970s when [[Nathan Road]] became prosperous, Shanghai Street was the leading business corridor in Hong Kong. In the mid 19th century Station Street had already started to prosper. In the tax record book of 1880, there were 150 taxed units, including a brothel, the most number of units at that time. There were about 9,000 people living in Yau Ma Tei at that time and the district was already the most populated. With the addition of over a hundred shops, the district became the most prosperous area from the late 19th century to the mid 20th century. The shops there were originally related to traditional Chinese trades and livelihoods, including shops selling traditional wedding dresses, [[fung shui]] tools, pawnshops and books. From the 1970s to 1990s, the Mong Kok area of Shanghai Street was characterised by a wide variety of [[Host and hostess clubs|hostess clubs]] and other venues related to the [[sex industry|sex trade]]; these continue to trade alongside the traditional businesses and residential units.\n\n==Features==\n[[File:Langham Place from the view of Shanghai Street.JPG|thumb|[[Langham Place, Hong Kong|Langham Place]] seen from Shanghai Street.]]\n[[Image:HK LCK Lai Chi Kok Road Shanghai Street 711.JPG|thumb|The northern end of Shanghai Street, near its intersection with [[Lai Chi Kok Road]].]]\nThe following list follows a south-north order.

There were various reasons for the existence of ''tong lau'' in Hong Kong, which including economic development of Hong Kong, [[Second World War]] and also the influx of Chinese migrants to Hong Kong.<ref>[http://www.ura.org.hk/html/c806000e2b.html Urban Renewal Authority.]</ref>\n\nThese 10 typical shophouses are believed to have been built in the 1920s and 1930s, which are typical of an old commercial street.

Four 1960s buildings that dissect the shophouse cluster in Shanghai Street are also included in the project. The Shanghai Street project covers\nan area of about 1,128m<sup>2</sup>.

This conservation plan is the initiative of the expanded conservation strategy for 48 pre-war shophouses across Hong Kong. The URA has two alternatives: to buy property rights of the shop houses and redevelop them into commercial or other uses; to re-zone them so as to limit the use of those shop houses for preservation purposes.<ref name=\"To restore or to destroy - should Hong Kong save its shop houses?\">[http://jmsc.hku.hk/hkstories/content/view/687/8307/]</ref> Most of the cost, about $1.23 billion, would be spent on property acquisition and tenants' rehousing of the 73 households with 220 residents in the two sites' 24 buildings. The remaining one-tenth of the sum is used for renovation.\n\nFor shophouses in Shanghai Street, necessary building services such as lifts, fire escapes and disabled access for the shophouses would be built in the 1960s buildings. The exact usage of the revamped shophouses has not been determined and is open to any options. One of the tentative suggestions is to house low-priced restaurant so that the public will have opportunities to use the verandas. The proposed aim is transforming Shanghai Street into a popular food street, or directly translated from the Chinese as \"Food Paradise\".<ref name=\"Sham Preservation\">Asia City Online Ltd. (2008).

Parallel to Shanghai Street are [[Nathan Road]], [[Temple Street, Hong Kong|Temple Street]], [[Portland Street]], [[Reclamation Street]] and [[Canton Road]].

Prior to being renamed Shanghai Street it was originally called Station Street (\u5dee\u9928\u8857). The reason being the presence of [[Yau Ma Tei Police Station]], a police station located at the junction of [[Public Square Street]] and Shanghai Street, until its relocation to No. 627 [[Canton Road]] in 1922. Since the police station was the landmark of the area, the street was named for it. On 12 November 1898, it was divided into two sections, Station Street South and Station Street North.\n\nThere are two reasons for the streets renaming. First, in 1909, the Government started to name streets in Kowloon after major Chinese provinces that traded with Hong Kong, to recognise Hong Kong as a commercial port. The British colonial government in Hong Kong found the area of Station Street was as prosperous as Shanghai in China at that time while Hong Kong was having trade relation with Shanghai. Therefore, they renamed ''Station street'' to ''Shanghai Street'' on 19 March 1909.<ref>[http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkgro/view/g1909/11841.pdf ''The Hong Kong Government Gazette'', March 19, 1909]</ref> The second reason was that there was a street called Upper Station Street (\u5dee\u9928\u4e0a\u8857) in [[Sheung Wan]], in [[Hong Kong Island]] and it caused confusion with the one in Yau Ma Tei and Mong Kok.\n\nOne of the then two [[Magistrates' court (Hong Kong)|Magistrate's Courts]] of Kowloon was located in Shanghai Street between [[Public Square Street]] and Market Street, until it was demolished in 1957. The other one was the Kowloon Magistracy in [[Gascoigne Road]],<ref name=\"Resource Kit\">[http://www.heritage.gov.hk/en/doc/Resource%20kit_North_Kowloon_Magistracy.pdf Conserve and Revitalise Hong Kong Heritage \u2013 North Kowloon Magistracy \u2013 Resource Kit]</ref> built in 1936 and renamed the [[Old South Kowloon District Court|South Kowloon District Court]] in 1957.<ref>[http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/Brief_Information_on_proposed_Grade_I_Items.pdf Antiquities and Monuments Office: Brief Information on Proposed Grade I Items, pp. 240\u2013241] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013023413/http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/ce/Museum/Monument/form/Brief_Information_on_proposed_Grade_I_Items.pdf |date=13 October 2012 }}</ref> The [[North Kowloon Magistracy]], built in 1960 in [[Shek Kip Mei]], later shared the workload.\n\nBefore the 1970s when [[Nathan Road]] became prosperous, Shanghai Street was the leading business corridor in Hong Kong. In the mid 19th century Station Street had already started to prosper. In the tax record book of 1880, there were 150 taxed units, including a brothel, the most number of units at that time. There were about 9,000 people living in Yau Ma Tei at that time and the district was already the most populated. With the addition of over a hundred shops, the district became the most prosperous area from the late 19th century to the mid 20th century. The shops there were originally related to traditional Chinese trades and livelihoods, including shops selling traditional wedding dresses, [[fung shui]] tools, pawnshops and books. From the 1970s to 1990s, the Mong Kok area of Shanghai Street was characterised by a wide variety of [[Host and hostess clubs|hostess clubs]] and other venues related to the [[sex industry|sex trade]]; these continue to trade alongside the traditional businesses and residential units.\n\n==Features==\n[[File:Langham Place from the view of Shanghai Street.JPG|thumb|[[Langham Place, Hong Kong|Langham Place]] seen from Shanghai Street.]]\n[[Image:HK LCK Lai Chi Kok Road Shanghai Street 711.JPG|thumb|The northern end of Shanghai Street, near its intersection with [[Lai Chi Kok Road]].]]\nThe following list follows a south-north order.

This conservation plan is the initiative of the expanded conservation strategy for 48 pre-war shophouses across Hong Kong.

The remaining one-tenth of the sum is used for renovation.\n\nFor shophouses in Shanghai Street, necessary building services such as lifts, fire escapes and disabled access for the shophouses would be built in the 1960s buildings. The exact usage of the revamped shophouses has not been determined and is open to any options. One of the tentative suggestions is to house low-priced restaurant so that the public will have opportunities to use the verandas.

The event was organised by the [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] (WPBSA), and was the eighth consecutive [[World Snooker Championship]] to be held at the Crucible since the event was first held there in [[1977 World Snooker Championship|1977]]. The event featured 94 participants, with a qualifying event for the championship (held at the [[Redwood Lodge (Bristol)|Redwood Lodge]] in [[Bristol]]) from 1 to 13 April for 78 players; 16 of which reached the main stage, where they met 16 invited seeded competitors. The total prize fund for the event was [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]200,000, the highest total pool for any snooker tournament to that date; the winner received \u00a344,000. \n\nThe defending champion was English player [[Steve Davis]], who had won the title twice previously. He met countryman [[Jimmy White]] in the final, played as a best-of-35-{{cuegloss|frame|frames}} match, leading heavily after the first two sessions 12\u20134.

It was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 21 November 2015. It is written by [[Sarah Dollard]] and directed by Justin Molotnikov.\n\nIn the episode, the alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] the [[Twelfth Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) is lured to a hidden [[trap street]] populated by extraterrestrial refugees in the centre of London after a death sentence, in the form of a countdown tattoo, has been placed on the Doctor's friend Rigsy ([[Joivan Wade]]) by [[Ashildr|Me]] ([[Maisie Williams]]), the street's mayor. In an attempt to buy more time, the Doctor's companion [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] ([[Jenna Coleman]]) puts her life in danger by having the tattoo transferred to her.\n\n==Plot==\nRigsy contacts the [[Twelfth Doctor]] and [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] for help. He shows them a number tattoo on his neck, counting down, with no memory of how he got it nor events of the last day. They trace his movements to a [[trap street]] in present-day London that houses extraterrestrial refugees, using telepathic alien worms to appear as human to the Doctor, Clara, and Rigsy.\n\n[[Ashildr|Me]],{{refn|group=N|Listed in the credits as her original name, [[Ashildr]].}} the immortal mayor of the trap street, explains that she sentenced Rigsy to death after he was accused of murdering Anah, a two-face Janus. They gave him a Chronolock: a tattoo which counts down with each passing minute. When it reaches zero, a Quantum Shade (a being that takes the form of a raven) is summoned to kill him. However, they also had to give Rigsy an amnesia drug to forget the trap street's existence. Me allows the Doctor and Clara to prove Rigsy's innocence. Clara learns that the Chronolock can be transferred to another willingly. Believing Me will not let her die, Clara takes Rigsy's Chronolock without the Doctor's knowledge to buy them more time.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (25307760809).jpg|thumb|left|The painted TARDIS exterior, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience.]]\nThe trio meet Anah's psychic daughter, Anahson, and learn that Me used Rigsy to bring the Doctor to the trap street and that Me is afraid of someone Anahson cannot identify. The Doctor realises from the medical data in the stasis pod Anah is stored inside that Anah is still alive, and that Me wants Anah to be released with the TARDIS key. However, the device clamps a metal ring around his wrist and takes the TARDIS key from him. The band is a teleportation device to send the Doctor far away to keep the street safe from the people Me made a deal with. Me demands the Doctor's Confession Dial. Me then goes to remove the Chronolock from Rigsy only to discover Clara had taken it; Clara broke the contract Me had made with the Shade and she cannot undo it. The Doctor becomes angry and threatens Me, demanding that she saves Clara, but Clara calms him down, asking him not to be upset nor avenge her death. Clara says her goodbyes and then steps into the street to face the Shade before it kills her. Back in the house, the Doctor warns Me to keep away from him in future. Me then activates the band, sending the Doctor away.\n\n===Continuity===\nThe Doctor once again consults his response cards, first seen in \"[[Under the Lake]]\", in \"an effort to be nice\" before breaking the news to Rigsy of his impending death.<ref>{{Citation | title = \u2018Face the raven\u2019 hits teasers set | publisher = Doctor Who TV | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | url = http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/face-the-raven-hints-teasers-set-1-78154.htm}}.</ref>\n\nRigsy is injected with Retcon, a substance introduced in the ''Doctor Who'' spinoff, ''[[Torchwood]]'', to cause those that take it to lose their memory of meeting members of Torchwood and having alien encounters.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-11-21/did-you-spot-the-torchwood-reference-in-this-weeks-doctor-who | title  = Did you spot the Torchwood reference in this week\u2019s Doctor Who?  | first = Huw | last = Fullerton  | date = 21 November 2015 | accessdate = 22 November 2015 | work = [[Radio Times]] }}</ref>\n\nAmong the disguised aliens living on the trap street are a [[Sontarans|Sontaran]], [[Judoon]], an [[Ice Warrior]] and an [[Ood]] caring for a [[Cybermen|Cyberman]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-11-21/did-you-spot-the-hidden-monsters-in-this-weeks-doctor-who|title=Did you spot the hidden monsters in this week\u2019s Doctor Who?|work=[[Radio Times]]|year=2015|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nMe asks the Doctor for his confession dial, first seen in \"The Magician's Apprentice\" and retrieved by the Doctor in \"[[The Witch's Familiar]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/doctor-who-series-9/37921/doctor-who-series-9-geeky-spots-in-face-the-raven|title=Doctor Who series 9: geeky spots in Face The Raven|work=Den of Geek}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/face-the-raven-hints-teasers-set-2-78168.htm|title=Face the Raven: Hints & Teasers (Set #2)|work=Doctor Who TV}}</ref>\n\nClara mentions her deceased lover [[Danny Pink]], saying that if he could face death (as he did in \"[[Death in Heaven]]\"), then so can she.<ref>{{Citation | newspaper = Forbes | date = 2015-11-21 | title = Doctor Who recap season 9, episode 10 \u2018Face the raven\u2019: Clara Oswald\u2019s finest hour is her last | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/reehines/2015/11/21/doctor-who-recap-season-9-episode-10-face-the-raven-clara-oswalds-finest-hour-is-her-last/}}.</ref>\n\nAs Clara entreats the Doctor not to take revenge on Ashildr, she tells him \"don't be a warrior.... be a Doctor\".

It was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 21 November 2015. It is written by [[Sarah Dollard]] and directed by Justin Molotnikov.\n\nIn the episode, the alien [[Time travel in fiction|time traveller]] the [[Twelfth Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) is lured to a hidden [[trap street]] populated by extraterrestrial refugees in the centre of London after a death sentence, in the form of a counting down tattoo, has been placed on the Doctor's friend friend Rigsy ([[Joivan Wade]]) by [[Ashildr|Me]] ([[Maisie Williams]]), the street's mayor. In an attempt to buy more time, the Doctor's companion [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] ([[Jenna Coleman]]) puts her life in danger by having the tattoo transferred to her.\n\n==Plot==\nRigsy contacts the [[Twelfth Doctor]] and [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] for help. He shows them a number tattoo on his neck, counting down, with no memory of how he got it nor events of the last day. They trace his movements to a [[trap street]] in present-day London that houses extraterrestrial refugees, using telepathic alien worms to appear as human to the Doctor, Clara, and Rigsy.\n\n[[Ashildr|Me]],{{refn|group=N|Listed in the credits as her original name, [[Ashildr]].}} the immortal mayor of the trap street, explains that she sentenced Rigsy to death after he was accused of murdering Anah, a two-face Janus. They gave him a Chronolock: a tattoo which counts down with each passing minute. When it reaches zero, a Quantum Shade (a being that takes the form of a raven) is summoned to kill him. However, they also had to give Rigsy an amnesia drug to forget the trap street's existence. Me allows the Doctor and Clara to prove Rigsy's innocence. Clara learns that the Chronolock can be transferred to another willingly. Believing Me will not let her die, Clara takes Rigsy's Chronolock without the Doctor's knowledge to buy them more time.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (25307760809).jpg|thumb|left|The painted TARDIS exterior, as shown at the Doctor Who Experience.]]\nThe trio meet Anah's psychic daughter, Anahson, and learn that Me used Rigsy to bring the Doctor to the trap street and that Me is afraid of someone Anahson cannot identify. The Doctor realises from the medical data in the stasis pod Anah is stored inside that Anah is still alive, and that Me wants Anah to be released with the TARDIS key. However, the device clamps a metal ring around his wrist and takes the TARDIS key from him. The band is a teleportation device to send the Doctor far away to keep the street safe from the people Me made a deal with. Me demands the Doctor's Confession Dial. Me then goes to remove the Chronolock from Rigsy only to discover Clara had taken it; Clara broke the contract Me had made with the Shade and she cannot undo it. The Doctor becomes angry and threatens Me, demanding that she saves Clara, but Clara calms him down, asking him not to be upset nor avenge her death. Clara says her goodbyes and then steps into the street to face the Shade before it kills her. Back in the house, the Doctor warns Me to keep away from him in future. Me then activates the band, sending the Doctor away.\n\n===Continuity===\nThe Doctor once again consults his response cards, first seen in \"[[Under the Lake]]\", in \"an effort to be nice\" before breaking the news to Rigsy of his impending death.<ref>{{Citation | title = \u2018Face the raven\u2019 hits teasers set | publisher = Doctor Who TV | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | url = http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/face-the-raven-hints-teasers-set-1-78154.htm}}.</ref>\n\nRigsy is injected with Retcon, a substance introduced in the ''Doctor Who'' spinoff, ''[[Torchwood]]'', to cause those that take it to lose their memory of meeting members of Torchwood and having alien encounters.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-11-21/did-you-spot-the-torchwood-reference-in-this-weeks-doctor-who | title  = Did you spot the Torchwood reference in this week\u2019s Doctor Who?  | first = Huw | last = Fullerton  | date = 21 November 2015 | accessdate = 22 November 2015 | work = [[Radio Times]] }}</ref>\n\nAmong the disguised aliens living on the trap street are a [[Sontarans|Sontaran]], [[Judoon]], an [[Ice Warrior]] and an [[Ood]] caring for a [[Cybermen|Cyberman]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-11-21/did-you-spot-the-hidden-monsters-in-this-weeks-doctor-who|title=Did you spot the hidden monsters in this week\u2019s Doctor Who?|work=[[Radio Times]]|year=2015|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nMe asks the Doctor for his confession dial, first seen in \"The Magician's Apprentice\" and retrieved by the Doctor in \"[[The Witch's Familiar]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/doctor-who-series-9/37921/doctor-who-series-9-geeky-spots-in-face-the-raven|title=Doctor Who series 9: geeky spots in Face The Raven|work=Den of Geek}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/face-the-raven-hints-teasers-set-2-78168.htm|title=Face the Raven: Hints & Teasers (Set #2)|work=Doctor Who TV}}</ref>\n\nClara mentions her deceased lover [[Danny Pink]], saying that if he could face death (as he did in \"[[Death in Heaven]]\"), then so can she.<ref>{{Citation | newspaper = Forbes | date = 2015-11-21 | title = Doctor Who recap season 9, episode 10 \u2018Face the raven\u2019: Clara Oswald\u2019s finest hour is her last | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/reehines/2015/11/21/doctor-who-recap-season-9-episode-10-face-the-raven-clara-oswalds-finest-hour-is-her-last/}}.</ref>\n\nAs Clara entreats the Doctor not to take revenge on Ashildr, she tells him \"don't be a warrior.... be a Doctor\".

Cash flows after the forecast period are represented by a single number.\n\nThe forecast period must be chosen to be appropriate to the company's strategy, its market, or industry;<ref name=\"Fabozzi et al\"/> theoretically corresponding to the time for the company's ([[profit (economics)|excess]]) [[return on capital|return]] to \"converge\" to that of its industry, with constant, long term growth applying to the continuing value thereafter; although, regardless, 5\u201310 years is common in practice<ref name=\"Fabozzi et al\"/> (see {{slink|Sustainable growth rate|From a financial perspective}} for discussion of the economic argument here).\n\nFor [[private equity]] and [[venture capital]] investments, the period will depend on the [[Private equity#Investment timescales|investment timescale]] and [[Exit strategy#In business|exit strategy]].<ref name=\"McKinsey\"/>\n\nSee further under [[Forecast period (finance)]], as well as [[#Determine the continuing value|\u00a7 Determine the continuing value]] below.\n\n=== Determine cash flow for each forecast period ===\nAs above, an explicit [[Cash flow forecasting|cash flow forecast]] is required for each year during the forecast period. These must be \"[[Free cash flow]]\" or [[dividend]]s.\n\nTypically, this forecast will be constructed using historical internal accounting and sales data, in addition to external industry data and economic indicators (for these latter, outside of large institutions, typically relying on [[Economic forecasting#List of regularly published surveys based on polling economists on their forecasts|published surveys]]). \nThe key aspect of the forecast is, arguably, [[Revenue management#Forecasting|predicting revenue]], a function of the analyst's forecasts re market size, demand, inventory availability, and the firm's [[market share]] and [[market power]]; \nfuture costs, fixed and variable, as well as capital, can then be estimated as a function of sales via [[Financial analysis#Method|\"common-sized analysis\"]].\n\nAt the same time, the resultant line items must talk to the business' operations: in general, growth in revenue will require corresponding increases in [[working capital]], [[fixed assets]] and associated financing; and in the long term, profitability (and other financial ratios) should tend to the industry average, as mentioned above; see {{slink|Financial modeling|Accounting}}, and {{slink|Sustainable growth rate|From a financial perspective}}.  Approaches to identifying which assumptions are most impactful on the value \u2013 and thus need the most attention \u2013 and to model \"calibration\" are discussed [[#Determine equity value|below]] (the process is then somewhat iterative). For the components / steps of business modeling here, see the list for \"Equity valuation\" under {{slink|Outline of finance|Discounted cash flow valuation}}, as well as [[financial forecast]] more generally.\n\nThere are several context dependent modifications:\n*Importantly, in the case of a [[startup]],<ref name=\"McKinsey\"/> substantial costs are often incurred at the start of the first year \u2013 and with certainty \u2013 and these should then be modelled separately from other cash flows, and not discounted at all. (See comment in example.) Ongoing costs, and capital requirements, can be proxied on a similar company, or industry averages; analogous to the \"common-sized\" approach mentioned.\n*For corporate finance projects,<ref name=\"IFA\"/> cash flows should be estimated incrementally, i.e. the analysis should only consider cash flows that could change if the proposed investment is implemented. (This principle is generally correct, and applies to all (equity) investments, not just to corporate finance; in fact, the above formulae do reflect this, since, from the perspective of a listed or private equity investor ''all'' expected cash flows are incremental, and the full FCFF or dividend stream is then discounted.)\n*For an [[Mergers and acquisitions#Business valuation|M&A valuation]]<ref name=\"M&A\">W. Brotherson, K. Eades, R. Harris, R. Higgins (2014).

[[Mergers and acquisitions#Improving financial performance or reducing risk|Synergies]] or [[Mergers and acquisitions#Strategic mergers|strategic opportunities]] will often be dealt with either by probability weighting / haircutting these, or by separating these into their own DCF valuation where a higher discount rate reflects their uncertainty.

Discounting is correspondingly at the [[cost of equity]]. Further, as these firms operate within a [[Financial regulation|highly regulated environment]], forecast assumptions must incorporate this reality, and outputs must similarly be \"bound\" by [[Regulatory capital|regulatory limits]]. ([[Loan covenant]]s in place will similarly impact corporate finance and M&A models.)\n\nAlternate approaches within DCF valuation will more directly consider [[economic profit]], and the definitions of \"cashflow\" will differ correspondingly; the best known is [[Economic value added|EVA]]. With the cost of capital correctly and correspondingly adjusted, the valuation should yield the same result.<ref>Pablo Fernandez (2004). [https://ideas.repec.org/p/ebg/iesewp/d-0549.html ''Equivalence of ten different discounted cash flow valuation methods'']. IESE Research Papers.

Further, these may be less sensitive to terminal value.<ref name=\"Nissim\"/> See {{slink|Residual income valuation|Comparison with other valuation methods}}.\n\n=== Determine discount factor / rate ===\nA fundamental element of the valuation is to determine the ''appropriate'' [[required rate of return]], as based on the risk level associated with the company and its market.\n\nTypically, for an established (listed) company: \n#For the cost of equity, the analyst will apply a model such as the CAPM most commonly; see {{slink|Capital asset pricing model|Asset-specific required return}} and [[Beta (finance)]]. An unlisted company\u2019s Beta can be based on that of a listed proxy as adjusted for [[Gearing (finance)|gearing]],  ie debt, via [[Hamada's equation]]. (Other approaches, such as the [[Business valuation#Build-Up Method|\"Build-Up method\"]] or [[T-model]] are also applied.)\n#The cost of debt may be calculated for each period as the scheduled after-tax interest payment as a percentage of outstanding debt; see {{slink|Corporate finance|Debt capital}}.\n#The [[Weighted average cost of capital#Calculation|value-weighted combination of these]] will then return the appropriate [[Discounting#Discount rate|discount rate]] for each year of the forecast period. As the weight (and cost) of debt could vary over the forecast, each date's [[Discounting#Discount factor|discount factor]] will be compounded over the periods to that date.\n\nBy contrast, for [[venture capital]] and [[private equity]] valuations \u2013 and particularly where the company is a [[startup]], as in the example \u2013 the discount factor is often ''set'' by funding stage, as opposed to modeled (\"Risk Group\" in the example).<ref>Sanjai Bhagat (2013). [http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/bhagat/Bhagat-JRF-2014.pdf Why do venture capitalists use such high discount rates?].

McKinsey & Company</ref><ref name=\"Desach\u00e9\"/>\nIn its early stages, where the business [[Startup company#Startup actions|is more likely to fail]], a higher return is demanded in compensation; \nwhen mature, an approach similar to the preceding may be applied.\nSee: {{slink|Private equity|Investment timescales}}; {{slink|Venture capital|Financing stages}}.\n(Some analysts may instead account for this uncertainty by adjusting the cash flows directly: using [[certainty equivalent]]s; or applying (subjective) \"haircuts\" to the forecast numbers, a \"[[penalized present value]]\"; or via probability-weighting these as in [[rNPV]].)\n\nCorporate finance analysts usually apply the first, listed company, approach: here though it is the risk-characteristics of the project that must determine the cost of equity, and not those of the parent company.<ref name=\"IFA\"/> \nM&A analysts likewise apply the first approach, with risk as well as the target capital structure informing both the cost of equity and, naturally, WACC.<ref name=\"M&A\"/>\n\n=== Determine current value ===\nTo determine current value, the analyst calculates the current value of the future cash flows simply by multiplying each period's cash flow by the discount factor for the period in question; see [[time value of money]].\n\nWhere the forecast is yearly, an adjustment is sometimes made: although annual cash flows are discounted, it is not true that the entire cash flow comes in at the year end; rather, cash will flow in over the full year. To account for this, a \"mid-year adjustment\" is applied via the discount rate (and not to the forecast itself), affecting the required averaging.<ref>Chris Haynes (N.D.). [https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/mid-year-discount-definition ''Mid-Year Discount Definition'']</ref>\n\n=== Determine the continuing value ===\nThe continuing, or \"terminal\" value, is the estimated value of all cash flows after the forecast period. \n*Typically the approach is to calculate this value using a [[Terminal value (finance)#Perpetuity Growth Model|\"perpetuity growth model\"]], essentially returning the value of the future cash flows via a [[geometric series]]. Key here is the treatment of the long term growth rate, and correspondingly, the forecast period number of years assumed for the company to arrive at this mature stage; see {{slink|Sustainable growth rate|From a financial perspective}} and {{slink|Stock valuation|Growth rate}}.\n*The alternative, [[Terminal value (finance)#Exit Multiple Approach|exit multiple approach]], assumes that the business will be sold at the end of the projection period at some multiple of its final explicitly forecast cash flow: see [[Valuation using multiples]]. This is often the approach taken for venture capital valuations, where an [[Private equity secondary market#Types of secondary transactions|exit transaction]] is explicitly planned.\nWhichever approach, the terminal value is then discounted by the factor corresponding to the final explicit date.\n\nNote that this step carries more risk than the previous: being more distant in time, and effectively summarizing the company's future, there is (significantly) more uncertainty as compared to the explicit forecast period; and yet, potentially (often<ref name=\"M&A\"/>) this result contributes a significant proportion of the total value.\nHere, a very high proportion may suggest a flaw in the valuation (as commented in the example); but at the same time may, in fact, reflect how investors make money from equity investments \u2013 i.e. predominantly from [[capital gain]]s or price appreciation.<ref>[[Aswath Damodaran]] (2016).

This assessment is especially useful when the terminal value is estimated using the perpetuity approach; and can then also serve as a model \"calibration\". The use of traditional multiples may be limited in the case of startups<ref name=\"Desach\u00e9\"/> \u2013 where profit and cash flows are often negative \u2013 and ratios such as [[Price\u2013sales ratio|price/sales]] are then employed.\n*Very commonly, analysts will produce a valuation range, especially based on different terminal value assumptions as mentioned. They may also carry out a [[sensitivity analysis]]<ref name=\"McKinsey\"/> \u2013 measuring the impact on value for a small change in the input \u2013  to demonstrate how \"[[robust]]\" the stated value is; and identify which model inputs are most critical to the value. This allows for focus on the inputs that \"really drive value\", reducing the need to estimate dozens of variables.<ref>Aswath Damodaran (2016).

The approach is sometimes applied to corporate finance projects,<ref name=\"IFA\">International Federation of Accountants (2008). ''Project Appraisal Using Discounted Cash Flow''</ref> see {{slink|Corporate finance|Quantifying uncertainty}}. But, again, in the venture capital context, it is not often applied,<ref name=\"Fabozzi et al\">[[Frank Fabozzi]], Sergio M. Focardi, Caroline Jonas (2017).

To the extent that the price is lower than the DCF number, so she will be inclined to invest; see [[Margin of safety (financial)]] and [[Undervalued stock]]. The above calibration will be less relevant here; reasonable and robust assumptions more so. \n(A related approach is to \"[[reverse engineer]]\" the stock price; i.e. to  \"figure out how much cash flow the company would be expected to make to generate its current valuation...

All steps are explained in detail below.\n\n=== Determine forecast period ===\nThe initial step is to decide the forecast period, i.e. the time period for which the individual yearly cash flows input to the DCF formula will be explicitly modeled. Cash flows after the forecast period are represented by a single number.\n\nThe forecast period must be chosen to be appropriate to the company's strategy, its market, or industry;<ref name=\"Fabozzi et al\"/> theoretically corresponding to the time for the company's ([[profit (economics)|excess]]) [[return on capital|return]] to \"converge\" to that of its industry, with constant, long term growth applying to the continuing value thereafter; although, regardless, 5\u201310 years is common in practice<ref name=\"Fabozzi et al\"/> (see {{slink|Sustainable growth rate|From a financial perspective}} for discussion of the economic argument here).\n\nFor [[private equity]] and [[venture capital]] investments, the period will depend on the [[Private equity#Investment timescales|investment timescale]] and [[Exit strategy#In business|exit strategy]].<ref name=\"McKinsey\"/>\n\nSee further under [[Forecast period (finance)]], as well as [[#Determine the continuing value|\u00a7 Determine the continuing value]] below.\n\n=== Determine cash flow for each forecast period ===\nAs above, an explicit [[Cash flow forecasting|cash flow forecast]] is required for each year during the forecast period. These must be \"[[Free cash flow]]\" or [[dividend]]s.\n\nTypically, this forecast will be constructed using historical internal accounting and sales data, in addition to external industry data and economic indicators (for these latter, outside of large institutions, typically relying on [[Economic forecasting#List of regularly published surveys based on polling economists on their forecasts|published surveys]]). \nThe key aspect of the forecast is, arguably, [[Revenue management#Forecasting|predicting revenue]], a function of the analyst's forecasts re market size, demand, inventory availability, and the firm's [[market share]] and [[market power]]; \nfuture costs, fixed and variable, as well as capital, can then be estimated as a function of sales via [[Financial analysis#Method|\"common-sized analysis\"]].\n\nAt the same time, the resultant line items must talk to the business' operations: in general, growth in revenue will require corresponding increases in [[working capital]], [[fixed assets]] and associated financing; and in the long term, profitability (and other financial ratios) should tend to the industry average, as mentioned above; see {{slink|Financial modeling|Accounting}}, and {{slink|Sustainable growth rate|From a financial perspective}}.  Approaches to identifying which assumptions are most impactful on the value \u2013 and thus need the most attention \u2013 and to model \"calibration\" are discussed [[#Determine equity value|below]] (the process is then somewhat iterative). For the components / steps of business modeling here, see the list for \"Equity valuation\" under {{slink|Outline of finance|Discounted cash flow valuation}}, as well as [[financial forecast]] more generally.\n\nThere are several context dependent modifications:\n*Importantly, in the case of a [[startup]],<ref name=\"McKinsey\"/> substantial costs are often incurred at the start of the first year \u2013 and with certainty \u2013 and these should then be modelled separately from other cash flows, and not discounted at all. (See comment in example.) Ongoing costs, and capital requirements, can be proxied on a similar company, or industry averages; analogous to the \"common-sized\" approach mentioned.\n*For corporate finance projects,<ref name=\"IFA\"/> cash flows should be estimated incrementally, i.e. the analysis should only consider cash flows that could change if the proposed investment is implemented. (This principle is generally correct, and applies to all (equity) investments, not just to corporate finance; in fact, the above formulae do reflect this, since, from the perspective of a listed or private equity investor ''all'' expected cash flows are incremental, and the full FCFF or dividend stream is then discounted.)\n*For an [[Mergers and acquisitions#Business valuation|M&A valuation]]<ref name=\"M&A\">W. Brotherson, K. Eades, R. Harris, R. Higgins (2014).

[[Mergers and acquisitions#Improving financial performance or reducing risk|Synergies]] or [[Mergers and acquisitions#Strategic mergers|strategic opportunities]] will often be dealt with either by probability weighting / haircutting these, or by separating these into their own DCF valuation where a higher discount rate reflects their uncertainty.

Discounting is correspondingly at the [[cost of equity]]. Further, as these firms operate within a [[Financial regulation|highly regulated environment]], forecast assumptions must incorporate this reality, and outputs must similarly be \"bound\" by [[Regulatory capital|regulatory limits]]. ([[Loan covenant]]s in place will similarly impact corporate finance and M&A models.)\n\nAlternate approaches within DCF valuation will more directly consider [[economic profit]], and the definitions of \"cashflow\" will differ correspondingly; the best known is [[Economic value added|EVA]]. With the cost of capital correctly and correspondingly adjusted, the valuation should yield the same result.<ref>Pablo Fernandez (2004). [https://ideas.repec.org/p/ebg/iesewp/d-0549.html ''Equivalence of ten different discounted cash flow valuation methods'']. IESE Research Papers.

Further, these may be less sensitive to terminal value.<ref name=\"Nissim\"/> See {{slink|Residual income valuation|Comparison with other valuation methods}}.\n\n=== Determine discount factor / rate ===\nA fundamental element of the valuation is to determine the ''appropriate'' [[required rate of return]], as based on the risk level associated with the company and its market.\n\nTypically, for an established (listed) company: \n#For the cost of equity, the analyst will apply a model such as the CAPM most commonly; see {{slink|Capital asset pricing model|Asset-specific required return}} and [[Beta (finance)]]. An unlisted company\u2019s Beta can be based on that of a listed proxy as adjusted for [[Gearing (finance)|gearing]],  ie debt, via [[Hamada's equation]]. (Other approaches, such as the [[Business valuation#Build-Up Method|\"Build-Up method\"]] or [[T-model]] are also applied.)\n#The cost of debt may be calculated for each period as the scheduled after-tax interest payment as a percentage of outstanding debt; see {{slink|Corporate finance|Debt capital}}.\n#The [[Weighted average cost of capital#Calculation|value-weighted combination of these]] will then return the appropriate [[Discounting#Discount rate|discount rate]] for each year of the forecast period. As the weight (and cost) of debt could vary over the forecast, each date's [[Discounting#Discount factor|discount factor]] will be compounded over the periods to that date.\n\nBy contrast, for [[venture capital]] and [[private equity]] valuations \u2013 and particularly where the company is a [[startup]], as in the example \u2013 the discount factor is often ''set'' by funding stage, as opposed to modeled (\"Risk Group\" in the example).<ref>Sanjai Bhagat (2013).

To account for this, a \"mid-year adjustment\" is applied via the discount rate (and not to the forecast itself), affecting the required averaging.<ref>Chris Haynes (N.D.). [https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/mid-year-discount-definition ''Mid-Year Discount Definition'']</ref>\n\n=== Determine the continuing value ===\nThe continuing, or \"terminal\" value, is the estimated value of all cash flows after the forecast period. \n*Typically the approach is to calculate this value using a [[Terminal value (finance)#Perpetuity Growth Model|\"perpetuity growth model\"]], essentially returning the value of the future cash flows via a [[geometric series]]. Key here is the treatment of the long term growth rate, and correspondingly, the forecast period number of years assumed for the company to arrive at this mature stage; see {{slink|Sustainable growth rate|From a financial perspective}} and {{slink|Stock valuation|Growth rate}}.\n*The alternative, [[Terminal value (finance)#Exit Multiple Approach|exit multiple approach]], assumes that the business will be sold at the end of the projection period at some multiple of its final explicitly forecast cash flow: see [[Valuation using multiples]]. This is often the approach taken for venture capital valuations, where an [[Private equity secondary market#Types of secondary transactions|exit transaction]] is explicitly planned.\nWhichever approach, the terminal value is then discounted by the factor corresponding to the final explicit date.\n\nNote that this step carries more risk than the previous: being more distant in time, and effectively summarizing the company's future, there is (significantly) more uncertainty as compared to the explicit forecast period; and yet, potentially (often<ref name=\"M&A\"/>) this result contributes a significant proportion of the total value.\nHere, a very high proportion may suggest a flaw in the valuation (as commented in the example); but at the same time may, in fact, reflect how investors make money from equity investments \u2013 i.e. predominantly from [[capital gain]]s or price appreciation.<ref>[[Aswath Damodaran]] (2016).

[http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/ovhds/inv2E/probabilistic.pdf ''Probabilistic Approaches in Valuation'']. Stern NYU</ref><ref name=\"IFA\"/>\nWith the first two, the output price is then market related, and the model will be [[All models are wrong#Quotations of George Box|driven by the relevant variables and assumptions]].

This assessment is especially useful when the terminal value is estimated using the perpetuity approach; and can then also serve as a model \"calibration\". The use of traditional multiples may be limited in the case of startups<ref name=\"Desach\u00e9\"/> \u2013 where profit and cash flows are often negative \u2013 and ratios such as [[Price\u2013sales ratio|price/sales]] are then employed.\n*Very commonly, analysts will produce a valuation range, especially based on different terminal value assumptions as mentioned. They may also carry out a [[sensitivity analysis]]<ref name=\"McKinsey\"/> \u2013 measuring the impact on value for a small change in the input \u2013  to demonstrate how \"[[robust]]\" the stated value is; and identify which model inputs are most critical to the value.

To the extent that the price is lower than the DCF number, so she will be inclined to invest; see [[Margin of safety (financial)]] and [[Undervalued stock]].
