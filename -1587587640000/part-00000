An autopsy of the soldier found that the right hemisphere of the brain was extensively damaged and large areas of it had necrosed. The brain was removed, preserved in formaldehyde and donated to the Army Museum in Washington. The primary cause of death had been infection caused by both the initial injury and subsequent necrosis of brain tissue.<ref>\"Medical and Surgical Reporter\", 1865 Vol XIII</ref> With 21st-century medical treatment, the soldier might well have survived with some degree of physical disability.{{fact|date=May 2019}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|War}}\n*[[Cap gun]]\n*[[Caplock mechanism]]\n*[[Gun barrel]]\n*[[Gunpowder]]\n*[[Internal ballistics]]\n*[[Muzzleloader]]\n*[[Nessler ball]]\n*[[Projectile]]\n*[[Rifling]]\n*[[Tubes and primers for ammunition]]\n\n== References ==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book|author=Brent Nosworthy|title=The Bloody Crucible of Courage, Fighting Methods and Combat Experience of the Civil War|publisher=Carroll and Graf Publishers|year=2003|isbn=0-7867-1147-7}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_minieball.html|title=The lead minie ball|work=CivilWar@Smithsonian}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.historynet.com/weaponry-the-rifle-musket-and-the-mini-ball.htm Weaponry: The Rifle-Musket and the Mini\u00e9 Ball]- Allan W.
