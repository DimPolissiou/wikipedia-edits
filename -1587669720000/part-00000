Mill replies politely and with his usual care that he finds many signs of competence in the work - mostly, however, in the form of \"promise rather than performance\" - and he exhorts Edger to continue thinking and writing, though not \"to the neglect of other modes of gaining a subsistence.\" Concerining Edger's views Mill says only that, if he were to comment in detail, he \"should have much to say against several of your positions, and especially against your definition of liberty.\"<ref>The Letters of John Stuart Mill, ed.

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward and airbrushed by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |last=Dimery |first=Robert |year=2005 |publisher=Quintet Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-84403-392-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 254] |url=https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 }}</ref>\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works.

However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''[[Space Oddity (album)|Space Oddity]]'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" (dedicated to his young son, known at the time as [[Duncan Jones|Zowie Bowie]] but legally named Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones) and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward and airbrushed by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die |last=Dimery |first=Robert |year=2005 |publisher=Quintet Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-84403-392-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 254] |url=https://archive.org/details/1001albumsyoumus0000unse_l0q0/page/254 }}</ref>\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Production ==\nWith new bass player [[Trevor Bolder]] replacing [[Tony Visconti]], ''Hunky Dory'' was the first production featuring all the members of the band that would become known the following year as Ziggy Stardust's [[The Spiders from Mars|Spiders From Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]].

However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''[[Space Oddity (album)|Space Oddity]]'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" (dedicated to his young son, known at the time as [[Duncan Jones|Zowie Bowie]] but legally named Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones) and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from

He was the first of only two men to captain the country at both rugby and cricket but is also remembered as the [[England cricket captains|England cricket captain]] whose side lost the Test match which gave rise to [[the Ashes]], at home against the [[Australian cricket team|Australians]] in 1882. Additionally, he played football for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Ranji 1897 page 199 A. N. Hornby.jpg|thumb|Hornby in the 1890s]]\nHe was the sixth son of [[William Henry Hornby (1805\u20131884)|William Henry Hornby]], a cotton mill proprietor and director of the [[Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway]] who was Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Blackburn (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackburn]] from 1857 to 1865. His brothers, [[Edward Kenworthy Hornby|Edward]] and [[Sir William Hornby, 1st Baronet|Harry]], were also MPs for Blackburn from 1869 to 1874, and from 1886 to 1910 respectively. [[Edward Kenworthy Hornby|Edward]] and another brother [[Cecil Hornby|Cecil]] also played first-class cricket. Albert attended [[Harrow School]] and from there returned to [[Lancashire]] to join the family business.\n\n==Cricket career==\nWhilst at Harrow, his family had moved to Shrewbridge Hall, Nantwich, Cheshire, and he first played cricket for that county in 1862 and played in 20 matches between then and 1876. His club cricket was for the East Lancashire Club, Blackburn and he was first tried for [[Lancashire County Cricket Club]] in 1867. It was with his county that he was to play his finest cricket. He went on to play for Lancashire for 33 years, 17 as captain (in 1879\u20131893 and 1897\u20131898). For many years he provided an ideal attacking foil to the careful defence of his opening partner, [[Dick Barlow]], with whom he was immortalised in one of the best known of all [[Cricket poetry|cricket poems]], ''At Lord's'' by [[Francis Thompson]] which contains the following lines:\n\n<poem>\n   It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk,\n      Though my own red roses there may blow;\n   It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk,\n      Though the red roses crest the caps, I know.\n   For the field is full of shades as I near a shadowy coast,\n   And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling of a ghost,\n   And I look through my tears on a soundless-clapping host\n      As the run stealers flicker to and fro,\n         To and fro:\n      O my Hornby and my Barlow long ago!\n</poem>\n\nHis lack of stature and excess of energy earned him the nickname \"Monkey\" whilst at school and this stuck, while his players called him \"The Boss\", for his martinet approach to captaincy. In all cricket sources, however, he is referred to ''by his initials'', and never by a nickname. His prowess as a forceful front-foot player, was matched by his fielding abilities. Between 1870 and 1881 he was the only player for Lancashire to reach a century for the club, which he did on seven occasions and in 1881 he topped the national averages, with his 1531 runs including three centuries.\n\nHornby was unable to carry his county form with the bat into the Test arena, his 3.50 average being a testament to this fact. In his debut Test on the 1878\u201379 Australian tour (during this tour, Hornby was caught up in the [[Sydney Riot of 1879]]) he lost his wicket in both innings to [[Fred Spofforth|Spofforth]]; this was to be repeated in his next Test in 1882. The [[Test cricket|Test match]] in 1882 was a one-off game played at [[The Oval]] in London, England, and the [[English cricket team]] lost it to Australia by seven runs. In response, the [[Sporting Times]] printed the following \"obituary\" to English cricket:\n<blockquote>''In Affectionate Remembrance of ENGLISH CRICKET, which died at the Oval on 29th AUGUST, 1882, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances R.I.P. N.B. \u2013 The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.''</blockquote>\nThus was born the greatest rivalry in cricket which to this day is known as [[The Ashes]]. AN Hornby captained England in only one more Test (his last), standing in for [[Lord Harris]] (who had stood out in protest) in the first Test of 1884. The match was played at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] on 10, 11 and 12 July 1884 and was drawn. Hornby avoided Spofforth but his 0 and 4 in the two innings remained undistinguished and in the same test match he also became the first player to be [[stumped]] in both innings of a single test match.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;dismissal=5;filter=advanced;orderby=start;orderbyad=reverse;qualmin1=2;qualval1=outs;template=results;type=batting;view=match|title=Batting records {{!}} Test matches {{!}} Cricinfo Statsguru {{!}} List of batsmen to be stumped in both innings of a test match|last=|first=|date=|website=Cricinfo|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=16 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his county and country, he also played first-class cricket for [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] between 1873 and 1898. Aside from his playing for Lancashire, Hornby also held the posts of Lancashire chairman from 1878 to 1898, and Lancashire president from 1894 to 1916.\n{{Infobox rugby biography | name = AN Hornby\n| image = \n| birth_name = Albert Neilson Hornby\n| nickname = \n| ru_position = three-quarter/full back\n| ru_nationalteam = [[England national rugby union team|England]]\n| ru_nationalcaps = 9\n| ru_nationalpoints = Tries (1)\n| ru_ntupdate = \n| ru_nationalyears = 1877\u20131882\n| ru_clubyears = \n| ru_clubupdate = \n| ru_clubcaps =\n| ru_clubpoints =\n| ru_proclubs = [[Manchester Rugby Club|Manchester Football Club]]<ref>Steve Lewis (2008) ''One among Equals''.

His first game for England was on 5 February 1877 under the captaincy of [[Edward Kewley]], a fellow Lancastrian. This match was the first 15-a-side international and was between England and Ireland at the [[Oval]]. He played as a [[Rugby union positions#Three-quarters|three-quarter]] and despite being 30 years old, kept his place. He was present in the team in 1878 but due to his overseas international cricketing commitments in 1879 was unable to play rugby for his country that year. He was recalled to the side in 1880 as a [[Fullback (rugby union)|full back]] and it was in this position that he was called upon to captain his country in 1882. The game was played in Manchester on 4 March 1882 against Scotland who won by 2 tries to nil. When, later that year, Hornby led the England cricket team out at the Oval to play the Australians he became the first man to captain his country in both sports and this in his 36th year. He is one of only two men to have captained England at [[List of cricket and rugby union players|both these sports]], the other being [[Andrew Stoddart]].\n\n==Association football==\nAs well as becoming captain of the national side for both cricket and rugby, Hornby was also selected to play for [[Blackburn Rovers]] in their inaugural game at Alexandra Meadows, against [[Partick Thistle]] on 2 January 1878. He played for them in a few subsequent matches. He later appeared for [[Nantwich Town F.C.|Nantwich]] where he also served as Club President.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chatwin|first=Michael|title=Proud to be the Dabbers|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-0956306807|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Tombstone of Albert Neilson Hornby,-Acton churchyard.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Tombstone of A.N. Hornby]] In 1876 he married Ada Sarah Ingram, the daughter of [[Herbert Ingram]] MP, the founder and proprietor of ''[[The Illustrated London News]]''. With Ada he lived in [[Church Minshull]], [[Nantwich]] and they had four sons all of whom went to Harrow. George Vernon (1879\u20131905) died in South Africa, having served in the [[Boer War]] whilst Walter Ingram (1878\u20131918) died of wounds received in France. The youngest, [[John Hornby|John]], (1880\u20131927) was also wounded during the First World War, was awarded the [[Military Cross]], and later died when exploring in the north of Canada. The eldest son, [[A. H. Hornby|Albert Henry]] (1877\u20131952) went on to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and like his father played and captained Lancashire. Between 1899\u20131914 he played 283 matches \u2013 only nine matches less than his father.\n\nHornby was also a Captain of 1st Royal Cheshire Militia. He died at Parkfield, Nantwich, Cheshire on 17 December 1925, and was buried in the churchyard of [[St Mary's Church, Acton|St Mary's Church]] in nearby [[Acton, Cheshire|Acton]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[History of Test cricket (to 1883)]]\n* [[History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category-inline|AN Hornby}}\n* [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Articles/1/1461.html Lancashire player number 30 \u2013 AN Hornby by Don Ambrose]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040622231538/http://www.cricinfo.com/db/PLAYERS/ENG/H/HORNBY_AN_01000032/ Cricinfo page on AN Hornby]\n* [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/32/32.html CricketArchive page on AN Hornby]\n* [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Articles/1/1461.html Biography on www.cricketarchive.com]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-sports}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Alfred Shaw]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[English national cricket captains|English national cricket captain]]|years=1882}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Honourable Ivo Bligh]]}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Charles Gurdon]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=English National Rugby Union Captain|years=Mar 1882}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Edward Gurdon]]}}\n{{end}}\n{{English Test cricket captains}}\n{{English national rugby union team captains}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hornby, An}}\n[[Category:1847 births]]\n[[Category:1925 deaths]]\n[[Category:England Test cricketers]]\n[[Category:England Test cricket captains]]\n[[Category:Lancashire cricket captains]]\n[[Category:England international rugby union players]]\n[[Category:People educated at Harrow School]]\n[[Category:Free Foresters cricketers]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Blackburn]]\n[[Category:Lancashire County RFU players]]\n[[Category:United North of England Eleven cricketers]]\n[[Category:Blackburn Rovers F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Gentlemen cricketers]]\n[[Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers]]\n[[Category:Over 30s v Under 30s cricketers]]\n[[Category:North of the Thames v South of the Thames cricketers]]\n[[Category:North v South cricketers]]\n[[Category:Gentlemen of the North cricketers]]\n[[Category:Gentlemen of England cricketers]]\n[[Category:Lancashire cricketers]]\n[[Category:Association footballers not categorized by position]]\n[[Category:English cricketers]]\n[[Category:English footballers]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|English athlete}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2018}}\n{{Infobox cricketer\n|          name = A.N.

He went on to play for Lancashire for 33 years, 17 as captain (in 1879\u20131893 and 1897\u20131898). For many years he provided an ideal attacking foil to the careful defence of his opening partner, [[Dick Barlow]], with whom he was immortalised in one of the best known of all [[Cricket poetry|cricket poems]], ''At Lord's'' by [[Francis Thompson]] which contains the following lines:\n\n<poem>\n   It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk,\n      Though my own red roses there may blow;\n   It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk,\n      Though the red roses crest the caps, I know.\n   For the field is full of shades as I near a shadowy coast,\n   And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling of a ghost,\n   And I look through my tears on a soundless-clapping host\n      As the run stealers flicker to and fro,\n         To and fro:\n      O my Hornby and my Barlow long ago!\n</poem>\n\nHis lack of stature and excess of energy earned him the nickname \"Monkey\" whilst at school and this stuck, while his players called him \"The Boss\", for his martinet approach to captaincy. In all cricket sources, however, he is referred to ''by his initials'', and never by a nickname. His prowess as a forceful front-foot player, was matched by his fielding abilities. Between 1870 and 1881 he was the only player for Lancashire to reach a century for the club, which he did on seven occasions and in 1881 he topped the national averages, with his 1531 runs including three centuries.\n\nHornby was unable to carry his county form with the bat into the Test arena, his 3.50 average being a testament to this fact. In his debut Test on the 1878\u201379 Australian tour (during this tour, Hornby was caught up in the [[Sydney Riot of 1879]]) he lost his wicket in both innings to [[Fred Spofforth|Spofforth]]; this was to be repeated in his next Test in 1882. The [[Test cricket|Test match]] in 1882 was a one-off game played at [[The Oval]] in London, England, and the [[English cricket team]] lost it to Australia by seven runs. In response, the [[Sporting Times]] printed the following \"obituary\" to English cricket:\n<blockquote>''In Affectionate Remembrance of ENGLISH CRICKET, which died at the Oval on 29th AUGUST, 1882, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances R.I.P. N.B. \u2013 The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.''</blockquote>\nThus was born the greatest rivalry in cricket which to this day is known as [[The Ashes]]. AN Hornby captained England in only one more Test (his last), standing in for [[Lord Harris]] (who had stood out in protest) in the first Test of 1884. The match was played at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] on 10, 11 and 12 July 1884 and was drawn. Hornby avoided Spofforth but his 0 and 4 in the two innings remained undistinguished and in the same test match he also became the first player to be [[stumped]] in both innings of a single test match.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;dismissal=5;filter=advanced;orderby=start;orderbyad=reverse;qualmin1=2;qualval1=outs;template=results;type=batting;view=match|title=Batting records {{!}} Test matches {{!}} Cricinfo Statsguru {{!}} List of batsmen to be stumped in both innings of a test match|last=|first=|date=|website=Cricinfo|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=16 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his county and country, he also played first-class cricket for [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] between 1873 and 1898. Aside from his playing for Lancashire, Hornby also held the posts of Lancashire chairman from 1878 to 1898, and Lancashire president from 1894 to 1916.\n{{Infobox rugby biography | name = AN Hornby\n| image = \n| birth_name = Albert Neilson Hornby\n| nickname = \n| ru_position = three-quarter/full back\n| ru_nationalteam = [[England national rugby union team|England]]\n| ru_nationalcaps = 9\n| ru_nationalpoints = Tries (1)\n| ru_ntupdate = \n| ru_nationalyears = 1877\u20131882\n| ru_clubyears = \n| ru_clubupdate = \n| ru_clubcaps =\n| ru_clubpoints =\n| ru_proclubs = [[Manchester Rugby Club|Manchester Football Club]]<ref>Steve Lewis (2008) ''One among Equals''.

His first game for England was on 5 February 1877 under the captaincy of [[Edward Kewley]], a fellow Lancastrian. This match was the first 15-a-side international and was between England and Ireland at the [[Oval]]. He played as a [[Rugby union positions#Three-quarters|three-quarter]] and despite being 30 years old, kept his place. He was present in the team in 1878 but due to his overseas international cricketing commitments in 1879 was unable to play rugby for his country that year. He was recalled to the side in 1880 as a [[Fullback (rugby union)|full back]] and it was in this position that he was called upon to captain his country in 1882. The game was played in Manchester on 4 March 1882 against Scotland who won by 2 tries to nil. When, later that year, Hornby led the England cricket team out at the Oval to play the Australians he became the first man to captain his country in both sports and this in his 36th year. He is one of only two men to have captained England at [[List of cricket and rugby union players|both these sports]], the other being [[Andrew Stoddart]].\n\n==Association football==\nAs well as becoming captain of the national side for both cricket and rugby, Hornby was also selected to play for [[Blackburn Rovers]] in their inaugural game at Alexandra Meadows, against [[Partick Thistle]] on 2 January 1878. He played for them in a few subsequent matches. He later appeared for [[Nantwich Town F.C.|Nantwich]] where he also served as Club President <ref>{{Cite book|last=Chatwin|first=Michael|title=Proud to be the Dabbers|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-0956306807|location=|pages=}}</ref>. \n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Tombstone of Albert Neilson Hornby,-Acton churchyard.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Tombstone of A.N. Hornby]] In 1876 he married Ada Sarah Ingram, the daughter of [[Herbert Ingram]] MP, the founder and proprietor of ''[[The Illustrated London News]]''. With Ada he lived in [[Church Minshull]], [[Nantwich]] and they had four sons all of whom went to Harrow. George Vernon (1879\u20131905) died in South Africa, having served in the [[Boer War]] whilst Walter Ingram (1878\u20131918) died of wounds received in France. The youngest, [[John Hornby|John]], (1880\u20131927) was also wounded during the First World War, was awarded the [[Military Cross]], and later died when exploring in the north of Canada. The eldest son, [[A. H. Hornby|Albert Henry]] (1877\u20131952) went on to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and like his father played and captained Lancashire. Between 1899\u20131914 he played 283 matches \u2013 only nine matches less than his father.\n\nHornby was also a Captain of 1st Royal Cheshire Militia. He died at Parkfield, Nantwich, Cheshire on 17 December 1925, and was buried in the churchyard of [[St Mary's Church, Acton|St Mary's Church]] in nearby [[Acton, Cheshire|Acton]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[History of Test cricket (to 1883)]]\n* [[History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commonscat-inline|AN Hornby}}\n* [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Articles/1/1461.html Lancashire player number 30 \u2013 AN Hornby by Don Ambrose]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040622231538/http://www.cricinfo.com/db/PLAYERS/ENG/H/HORNBY_AN_01000032/ Cricinfo page on AN Hornby]\n* [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/32/32.html CricketArchive page on AN Hornby]\n* [https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Articles/1/1461.html Biography on www.cricketarchive.com]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-sports}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Alfred Shaw]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[English national cricket captains|English national cricket captain]]|years=1882}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Honourable Ivo Bligh]]}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Charles Gurdon]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=English National Rugby Union Captain|years=Mar 1882}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Edward Gurdon]]}}\n{{end}}\n{{English Test cricket captains}}\n{{English national rugby union team captains}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hornby, An}}\n[[Category:1847 births]]\n[[Category:1925 deaths]]\n[[Category:England Test cricketers]]\n[[Category:England Test cricket captains]]\n[[Category:Lancashire cricket captains]]\n[[Category:England international rugby union players]]\n[[Category:People educated at Harrow School]]\n[[Category:Free Foresters cricketers]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Blackburn]]\n[[Category:Lancashire County RFU players]]\n[[Category:United North of England Eleven cricketers]]\n[[Category:Blackburn Rovers F.C. players]]\n[[Category:Gentlemen cricketers]]\n[[Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers]]\n[[Category:Over 30s v Under 30s cricketers]]\n[[Category:North of the Thames v South of the Thames cricketers]]\n[[Category:North v South cricketers]]\n[[Category:Gentlemen of the North cricketers]]\n[[Category:Gentlemen of England cricketers]]\n[[Category:Lancashire cricketers]]\n[[Category:Association footballers not categorized by position]]\n[[Category:English cricketers]]\n[[Category:English footballers]]\n", "name_user": "GiantSnowman", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._N._Hornby"}

In 1987, EchoStar applied for a [[Satellite television|direct-broadcast satellite]] [[broadcast license]] with the FCC and was granted access to orbital slot 119\u00b0 west [[longitude]] in 1992.<ref>{{cite web |title=Early Growth of Dish Network |url=http://dishnetwork.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=8777 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714065003/http://dishnetwork.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=8777 |archivedate=July 14, 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Dish Network logo 2012.svg|thumb|DISH Network logo from February 1, 2012-2019]]\nIn 1998 EchoStar purchased the broadcasting assets of a satellite broadcasting joint venture of [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] and [[MCI Communications|MCI]] Worldcom, called ASkyB (for ''[[Sky plc|American Sky Broadcasting]]'', named after News Corp's [[Sky UK|BSkyB]] service in Britain); the two companies had nearly merged (which called for DISH Network being renamed Sky) before it was called off due to Charlie Ergen's clashes with News Corp. executives. With this purchase EchoStar obtained 28 of the 32 transponder licenses in the 110\u00b0 West orbital slot, more than doubling existing continental United States broadcasting capacity at a value of $682.5 million; some of the other assets were picked up by rival [[PrimeStar]], which was sold to DirecTV in 1999. The acquisition (which also included an uplink center in [[Gilbert, Arizona]]) inspired the company to introduce a multi satellite system called DISH 500, theoretically capable of receiving more than 500 channels on one DISH. In the same year, EchoStar, partnering with [[Bell Canada]], launched [[Bell TV|DISH Network Canada]].\n\nOn December 7, 2007, EchoStar announced that it would spin off its technology and infrastructure assets into a separate company under the EchoStar name, after which the remainder of the company would be renamed DISH Network Corporation.

Dish Network announced as of February 1, 2006, that all new HDTV channels would be available in H.264 format only, while maintaining the current lineup as MPEG-2. DISH Network intends to eventually convert the entire platform to H.264 in order to provide more channels to subscribers. In 2007, DISH Network reduced the resolution of 1080-line channels from 1920x1080 to 1440x1080. Reducing horizontal resolution and/or data rate of HD video is known as [[HD Lite]] and is practiced by other TV providers as well.\n\nBoth a standard receiver and a receiver with built-in [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) were available to subscribers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mydish.com/upgrades/products/receivers |title=Dish's Current Offered Receivers |publisher=DISH}}</ref> The DISH Network ViP722 HD DVR (Record up to 350 hours of standard-definition (SD), up to 55 hours of high-definition (HD)) replacement to the ViP622 has received generally positive reviews<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-video-recorders-dvrs/Dish-network-vip622-hd/4505-6474_7-31778299.html |title=Dish Network ViP622 HD DVR Digital Video Recorder (DVR) reviews |website=[[CNET]] |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |date=October 4, 2006 |author=David Katzmaier |author2=John P.

These Set Top Boxes (STBs) allow for HD on the Primary TV and SD on the secondary TV (TV2) without a secondary box on TV2.\n\n==== High-definition television (HDTV) ====\nIn January 1999, the company released the industry's first [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) [[tuner (television)|tuner]]. In August 2003, the company launched EchoStar IX, the first satellite equipped with commercial Ka band payload for broadband service over the United States. This led the company in 2004 to be the first satellite TV service to offer local channels to all 50 states. In that year, the company also introduced the nation's first interactive TV multiple picture-in picture application for the Olympic Games, offering coverage from multiple channels at once. This year the company also acquired its ten millionth customer.\n\nIn January 2005, EchoStar bought the broadcasting assets of the troubled HDTV satellite provider [[Voom]], including its Rainbow 1 satellite co-located with EchoStar 3 at 61.5\u00b0 West. On April 29, EchoStar announced that it would expand its HDTV programming by adding the first 10 of 21 original Voom channels and mirror the channels on a CONUS slot. DISH Network added CNN HD in Spanish along with other packages in its Latino HD lineup.\n\n=== Receivers and devices ===\n==== Satellite antennas ====\nDISH Network offers different types of satellite receiving equipment for obtaining [[wikt:signal|signals]] from its diverse satellite fleet. Most of their consumer boxes are manufactured by [[Sanmina-SCI Corporation]] to DISH specifications. Prior to the December 2001 merger of SCI Systems and Sanmina, DISH Network receivers were produced at factories in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], Alabama and [[Fountain, Colorado|Fountain]], Colorado. Currently,{{When|date=November 2009}} receiver assembly takes place in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico and India.\n\n==== Earlier satellite dishes ====\nDISH Network's first satellite antenna was simply called the \"DISH Network\" dish. It was retroactively named the \"DISH 300\" when legal and satellite problems forced delays of the forthcoming DISH 500 systems. It uses one [[Low-noise block downconverter|LNB]] to obtain signals from the 119\u00b0W orbital location,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.Dishnetwork.com/downloads/pdf/user_guides_and_manuals/installation/117595_01_RV_Pointing_Table.PDF |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080117031239/http://www.dishnetwork.com/downloads/pdf/user_guides_and_manuals/installation/117595_01_RV_Pointing_Table.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 17, 2008 |title=Dish 300 and 500 Pointing Guide |publisher=Dish Network |format=PDF |accessdate=December 19, 2008 }}</ref> and was commonly used as a second dish to receive additional high-definition or international programming from either the 148\u00b0W or 61.5\u00b0W orbital locations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish61_sid.html |title=Channels at 61.5\u00b0W |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |publisher=Lyngsat |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217095710/http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish61_sid.html |archivedate=December 17, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish148_sid.html |title=Channels at 148\u00b0W |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |publisher=Lyngsat |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217095705/http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish148_sid.html |archivedate=December 17, 2008 }}</ref> The 119\u00b0W slot is one of two primary orbital locations, the other being 110\u00b0W, that provide core services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish110_sid.html |title=Channels at 110\u00b0W |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |publisher=Lyngsat |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217013237/http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish110_sid.html |archivedate=December 17, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish119_sid.html |title=Channels at 119\u00b0W |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |publisher=Lyngsat |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219040945/http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish119_sid.html |archivedate=December 19, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAfter EchoStar obtained the broadcasting assets of a failed joint venture between ASkyB and [[MCI Inc.|MCI WorldCom]], it had more than doubled its capacity by adding 28 transponders at the 110\u00b0W orbital location. Since EchoStar also owned the adjacent 119\u00b0W orbital location it developed the DISH 500 to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one dish and an innovative dual-[[Low-noise block downconverter|LNB]] assembly. Although the new 20-inch DISH 500 was slightly larger than the then-current 18-inch DISH 300 and DirecTV dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from EchoStar's two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical 500-channel capacity. The DISH 500, as a result, provided very large capacity for local-into-local service, nationwide programming, and business services. In order to migrate existing customers to DISH 500, DISH Network provides value-added channels in addition to local channels that can only be received with the DISH 500 and newer systems. Some of the channels exclusive to these newer systems are [[H2 (TV channel)|H<sub>2</sub>]], [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], [[The Science Channel|Science]], [[Destination America|Planet Green]], [[Universal Kids|PBS Kids Sprout]] and [[Comedy Central]].\n\n==== Tailgater ====\nTailgater is a portable satellite antenna; the tailgater can be purchased as a standalone device for $350.

With this purchase EchoStar obtained 28 of the 32 transponder licenses in the 110\u00b0 West orbital slot, more than doubling existing continental United States broadcasting capacity at a value of $682.5 million; some of the other assets were picked up by rival [[PrimeStar]], which was sold to DirecTV in 1999. The acquisition (which also included an uplink center in [[Gilbert, Arizona]]) inspired the company to introduce a multi satellite system called DISH 500, theoretically capable of receiving more than 500 channels on one DISH. In the same year, EchoStar, partnering with [[Bell Canada]], launched [[Bell TV|DISH Network Canada]].\n\nOn December 7, 2007, EchoStar announced that it would spin off its technology and infrastructure assets into a separate company under the EchoStar name, after which the remainder of the company would be renamed DISH Network Corporation.

Dish Network announced as of February 1, 2006, that all new HDTV channels would be available in H.264 format only, while maintaining the current lineup as MPEG-2. DISH Network intends to eventually convert the entire platform to H.264 in order to provide more channels to subscribers. In 2007, DISH Network reduced the resolution of 1080-line channels from 1920x1080 to 1440x1080. Reducing horizontal resolution and/or data rate of HD video is known as [[HD Lite]] and is practiced by other TV providers as well.\n\nBoth a standard receiver and a receiver with built-in [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) were available to subscribers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mydish.com/upgrades/products/receivers |title=Dish's Current Offered Receivers |publisher=DISH}}</ref> The DISH Network ViP722 HD DVR (Record up to 350 hours of standard-definition (SD), up to 55 hours of high-definition (HD)) replacement to the ViP622 has received generally positive reviews<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-video-recorders-dvrs/Dish-network-vip622-hd/4505-6474_7-31778299.html |title=Dish Network ViP622 HD DVR Digital Video Recorder (DVR) reviews |website=[[CNET]] |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |date=October 4, 2006 |author=David Katzmaier |author2=John P.

These Set Top Boxes (STBs) allow for HD on the Primary TV and SD on the secondary TV (TV2) without a secondary box on TV2.\n\n==== High-definition television (HDTV) ====\nIn January 1999, the company released the industry's first [[high-definition television]] (HDTV) [[tuner (television)|tuner]]. In August 2003, the company launched EchoStar IX, the first satellite equipped with commercial Ka band payload for broadband service over the United States. This led the company in 2004 to be the first satellite TV service to offer local channels to all 50 states. In that year, the company also introduced the nation's first interactive TV multiple picture-in picture application for the Olympic Games, offering coverage from multiple channels at once. This year the company also acquired its ten millionth customer.\n\nIn January 2005, EchoStar bought the broadcasting assets of the troubled HDTV satellite provider [[Voom]], including its Rainbow 1 satellite co-located with EchoStar 3 at 61.5\u00b0 West. On April 29, EchoStar announced that it would expand its HDTV programming by adding the first 10 of 21 original Voom channels and mirror the channels on a CONUS slot. DISH Network added CNN HD in Spanish along with other packages in its Latino HD lineup.\n\n=== Receivers and devices ===\n==== Satellite antennas ====\nDISH Network offers different types of satellite receiving equipment for obtaining [[wikt:signal|signals]] from its diverse satellite fleet. Most of their consumer boxes are manufactured by [[Sanmina-SCI Corporation]] to DISH specifications. Prior to the December 2001 merger of SCI Systems and Sanmina, DISH Network receivers were produced at factories in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], Alabama and [[Fountain, Colorado|Fountain]], Colorado. Currently,{{When|date=November 2009}} receiver assembly takes place in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico and India.\n\n==== Earlier satellite dishes ====\nDISH Network's first satellite antenna was simply called the \"DISH Network\" dish. It was retroactively named the \"DISH 300\" when legal and satellite problems forced delays of the forthcoming DISH 500 systems. It uses one [[Low-noise block downconverter|LNB]] to obtain signals from the 119\u00b0W orbital location,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.Dishnetwork.com/downloads/pdf/user_guides_and_manuals/installation/117595_01_RV_Pointing_Table.PDF |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080117031239/http://www.dishnetwork.com/downloads/pdf/user_guides_and_manuals/installation/117595_01_RV_Pointing_Table.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 17, 2008 |title=Dish 300 and 500 Pointing Guide |publisher=Dish Network |format=PDF |accessdate=December 19, 2008 }}</ref> and was commonly used as a second dish to receive additional high-definition or international programming from either the 148\u00b0W or 61.5\u00b0W orbital locations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish61_sid.html |title=Channels at 61.5\u00b0W |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |publisher=Lyngsat |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217095710/http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish61_sid.html |archivedate=December 17, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish148_sid.html |title=Channels at 148\u00b0W |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |publisher=Lyngsat |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217095705/http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish148_sid.html |archivedate=December 17, 2008 }}</ref> The 119\u00b0W slot is one of two primary orbital locations, the other being 110\u00b0W, that provide core services.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish110_sid.html |title=Channels at 110\u00b0W |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |publisher=Lyngsat |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217013237/http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish110_sid.html |archivedate=December 17, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish119_sid.html |title=Channels at 119\u00b0W |accessdate=December 19, 2008 |publisher=Lyngsat |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219040945/http://www.lyngsat.com/packages/dish119_sid.html |archivedate=December 19, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAfter EchoStar obtained the broadcasting assets of a failed joint venture between ASkyB and [[MCI Inc.|MCI WorldCom]], it had more than doubled its capacity by adding 28 transponders at the 110\u00b0W orbital location. Since EchoStar also owned the adjacent 119\u00b0W orbital location it developed the DISH 500 to receive the signals of both orbital locations using one dish and an innovative dual-[[Low-noise block downconverter|LNB]] assembly. Although the new 20-inch DISH 500 was slightly larger than the then-current 18-inch DISH 300 and DirecTV dishes it had the distinct advantage of obtaining signals from EchoStar's two adjacent satellite locations for a theoretical 500-channel capacity. The DISH 500, as a result, provided very large capacity for local-into-local service, nationwide programming, and business services. In order to migrate existing customers to DISH 500, DISH Network provides value-added channels in addition to local channels that can only be received with the DISH 500 and newer systems. Some of the channels exclusive to these newer systems are [[H2 (TV channel)|H<sub>2</sub>]], [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], [[The Science Channel|Science]], [[Destination America|Planet Green]], [[Universal Kids|PBS Kids Sprout]] and [[Comedy Central]].\n\n==== Tailgater ====\nTailgater is a portable satellite antenna; the tailgater can be purchased as a standalone device for $350. The Tailgater is now being supported by a Wally receiver, to replace the still supported 211k model.

It contains the background music from the two parts of ''Sailor Moon R'': the Alien arc (Ail+Ann or \"Ann & Alan\" in the dub) and the Black Moon/ChibiUsa arc which makes up the majority of ''Sailor Moon R''. The two songs included on this CD are the opening and closing theme song for ''Sailor Moon R'' (\"Otome no Policy\") and \"Suki to Itte\", a song used as background in ''Sailor Moon R''. Both are sung by '''ISHIDA Yoko''', who also sang the popular ''Sailor Moon R''/''Sailor Moon S'' battle song \"Ai no Senshi\" (Soldier of Love).\n\n{{Track listing \n| collapsed =  no\n| total_length =\n\n| title1 = Otome no Policy\n| note1 = \u4e59\u5973\u306e\u30dd\u30ea\u30b7\u30fc , A Maiden's Policy\n| length1 = 3:13\n\n| title2 = Y\u016bj\u014d, Soshite Ai \n| note2 = \u53cb\u60c5\uff0c\u305d\u3057\u3066\u611b ; Friendship, and Love \n| length2 = 6:15\n\n| title3 = Makaiju \n| note3 = \u9b54\u754c\u6a39, Hell Tree \n| length3 = 5:44\n\n| title4 = Watashi ga Tatakau \n| note4 = \u79c1\u304c\u6226\u3046, I Fight \n| length4 = 6:00\n\n| title5 = Kiyoku, Akaruku, \u25b3\u00d7\u25a1\u00a7 \n| note5 = \u6e05\u304f\uff0c\u660e\u308b\u304f\uff0c\u25b3\u00d7\u25a1\u00a7\u2026; Clean, Bright, \u25b3\u00d7\u25a1\u00a7\u2026 \n| length5 = 6:43\n\n| title6 = Aratanaru Teki \n| note6 = \u65b0\u305f\u306a\u308b\u6575, A New Enemy \n| length6 = 4:53\n\n| title7 = Tsuiseki ha Bouken no Hajimari \n| note7 = \u8ffd\u8de1\u306f\u5192\u967a\u306e\u306f\u3058\u307e\u308a, Tracking the Beginning of the Adventure \n| length7 = 4:54\n\n| title8 = Tsuki ha Miteiru \n| note8 = \u6708\u306f\u898b\u3066\u3044\u308b, The Moon is Watching\n| length8 = 5:03\n\n| title9 = Kanashimi wo Yuuki ni Kaete\n| note9 = \u60b2\u3057\u307f\u3092\u52c7\u6c17\u306b\u5909\u3048\u3066, Courage to End the Sorrow \n| length9 = 5:27\n\n| title10 = Suki to Itte \n| note10 = \u597d\u304d\u3068\u8a00\u3063\u3066 \n| length10 = 4:37\n}} \n{{-}}\n\n===Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon R - Mirai he Mukatte===\n{{Nihongo|''''' Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon R -Mirai e Mukatte-'''''| \u7f8e\u5c11\u5973\u6226\u58eb\u30bb\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30e0\u30fc\u30f3R -\u672a\u6765\u3078\u5411\u304b\u3063\u3066- |lit.

The [[Lingam|linga]] of Sreekanteswara (Siva) is believed to have been installed by Sree [[Parashurama]]. According to devotees, the samadhi of Sage Kanwa is in the precincts of the Temple. Chettikulam, a pond nearby that was reclaimed decades ago, is referred to in ''Syanandura Purana Samuchaya'' and ''Anantapura Varnana'' as Kanvatirtha.<ref>History of Sri Padmanabha Swamy Temple till 1758 - Dr A G Menon</ref> This lends credence to the belief that Old Sreekanteswaram and Chettikulangara formed part of Kanwa Tapovana. The idol of [[Krishna|Sri Krishna]] was installed later to reduce the ferocity of Shiva. The idols of [[Ganesha|Lord Ganesha]] and Serpent gods  also find place in the temple. All the deities here face east.\n\nMritunjaya Homam, Mrityunjaya archana, Jaladhara, Pinvilakku and Kuvala mala samarpanam are the most popular offerings made to Lord Siva.\n\n==Athiyara Eman and Yadavendran Thampuran==\nA saintly Brahmin from Vanchiyoor Athiyara Madhom was doing japam in the Old Sreekanteswaram Temple when a good looking young Yadava prince started jala kreeda in the temple pond with a beautiful Sudra girl. Then against her wishes, the prince carried her on his back into the Temple. The prince then forced himself upon the girl and the latter cried out for help. Athiyara Potti rushed to rescue her and cursed the prince that he would turn into half-man half-horse and that he would be enslaved for many years. The prince fell at the feet of the Brahmin and sought forgiveness. The Brahmin said that the royal in his new form would be slave for nine years and that in the tenth year he would earn the grace of Lord Sreekanteswara and attain salvation.\n\nAs the girl looked on, the prince was transformed into a handsome creature having a horse's body with the prince's head, arms and torso in place of the head and neck of the horse. He was devastated and swore never to return to his palace. The girl fell head over heels in love with the transformed prince.\n\nThe Yadava prince approached the girl's brother and sought her hand in marriage. But her brother who was then a boy told the prince that he would grant permission only if the prince becomes his slave. The prince agreed and the marriage was solemnised. Over the years, the prince had to endure a lot as the girl grew into a domineering wife and the boy into a sadistic master. But the prince never wished ill on his tormentors but turned more and more towards Lord Sreekanteswara. In the tenth year the Sudra master had a change of heart and released the prince from bondage.\n\nThe prince then met Athiyara Potti and sought his blessings. Athiyara Potti blessed the Yadava and accepted him as a disciple. The prince started worshipping Lord Sreekanteswara in His Kameswara form. Pleased with his devotion, Lord Kameswara and His consort Sree Lalitha Devi appeared before him and granted him salvation.\n\nThe Brahmin and the prince are popularly referred to as Athiyara Eman (Yajamanan) and Yadavendran Thampuran respectively.\n\n==Loss of importance==\nPazhaya Sreekanteswaram might have lost its importance to the new temple in the 18th century when the mercenaries of Sri Padmanabhan Thampi, son of King [[Rama Varma of Venad|Rama Varma]] and bete noire of Sri Anizhom Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]], were stationed at Kuthiravattom (a place near Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram).\n\nSri Anizhom Thirunal ascended the Throne of Travancore in 1729. Once when Anizhom Thirunal left for Kollam, Padmanabhan Thampi took control of the capital [[Padmanabhapuram|Kalkkulam]]. Padmanabhan Thampi marched to Thiruvananthapuram with his forces to appropriate the wealth of Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple. Thampi stayed at Srivaraham and stationed his cavalry at Kuthiravattom. He tried to amass wealth by collecting from the local people revenue that was due to the Temple. But stiff opposition from Pallichal Pillai and his men ensured that Thampi had to give up his venture.\n\n==The Tantri of the temple==\nVanchiyoor Athiyara Potti is the [[Thantri|Tantri]] of the temple. The Potti is a hereditary member of the [[Ettara Yogam]] which used to be the governing body of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple.\n\n==Important days==\n[[Maha Shivaratri]] and [[Thiruvathira]] are the days which attract huge crowds to the temple.\n\n==The management of the temple==\nThe temple, now, comes under the control of [[Devaswom boards in Kerala#Travancore Devaswom Board|Travancore Devaswom Board]]. Before it was taken over by the Board, the temple belonged to a prominent [[Nair]] [[tharavad]] by name Kovilvila.\n\n==Darsan==\n* Morning - 5.00 to 10.30\n* Evening - 5.00 to 8.00\n* Monday & Thursday \n* Morning - 5.00 to 11.00\n* Evening - 5.00 to 8.00\n\n==Kovilvila Tharavad==\nKovilvila Tharavad traces its roots to Valluvanad. Centuries ago, the nair tharavad had a [[Karanavar]] who was an advanced upasaka of Srividya sampradaya. He and his wife used a Meru [[Sri Yantra|Sreechakram]] for their worship. They had many disciples. Though they were revered by the people around, they were not in the good books of the ruler. Due to royal displeasure, the members of the tharavad had to flee to Pattazhi. From Pattazhi they moved to Thiruvananthapuram and settled there. The Karanavar and his wife continued their [[upasana]] in the land of Sri Padmanabha. After leading fruitful lives they reached the Divine Abode of [[Tripura Sundari|Lalita Parameswari]].\n\nIn course of time the family began to manage the affairs of Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple. Years rolled by. Besides Sreechakram, the family started worshipping [[Bhadrakali]] of a [[kalari]] and the great Karanavar who had attained the lotus-feet of the Divine Mother. By the blessings of Sreekanteswara and the Household Deities, the family prospered and reached great heights. But succeeding generations did not have the required degree of piety. The family is believed to have incurred the wrath of the Guardian Deities. Kovilvila House, along with the chamber in which the Guardian Deities were installed, was reduced to ashes. Though the tharavad managed to rise from the ashes, it did not resume the upasana for many years.\n\n==Kovilvila Bhagavati Temple==\nAfter an elaborate Ashtamangala Prasnam in December 2006, a new temple by the name Kovilvila Bhagavati Temple was constructed in a piece of land adjacent to Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram. This piece of land belonged to Kovilvila L Parukkutti Amma, the wife of Justice K. S. Govinda Pillai. The Guardian Deities of the tharavad - Kalari Bhadrakali, Meru Sreechakram, and Karanavar - were duly installed by the Tantri Thrippunithura Puliyannoor Murali Narayanan Nambuthiripad on 21 March 2008. One-hooded [[Nagaraja]], five-hooded Nagayakshi  and Chitrakootam were installed by Amedamangalathu Vishnu Nambuthiri on the next day.\n\nOffering Neyvilakku for eleven consecutive days is the most important vazhipadu in the Temple.\n\nBeing the day of installation of the Goddess, ''Uthram'' in the month of ''Meenom'', is the most important day in the temple calendar. Women devotees offer [[Pongala]]  on that day. ''Ayilyam'' in the month of ''Thulam'' is important for the Serpent gods.\n\n==Murals in Kovilvila Bhagavati Temple==\nThe Temple has in it grand mural paintings of Kalari Bhadrakali and Lalita Parameswari. According to Dr. M.G.Sasibhooshan, the mural of Lalita Parameswari is one of the largest of its kind.\n\n==Darsan==\n* Morning - 6.00 to 9.30\n* Evening - 5.30 to 7.30\n\n==Royal visit==\nPrincess [[Aswathi Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi]] visited Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple and Kovilvila Bhagavati Temple on 5 November 2013.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Hindu temples in Kerala]]\n* [[Kappazhom Raman Pillai]]\n* [[Sreekanteswaram Mahadeva Temple]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Articles Related to Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple\n|list =\n{{Hindu temples in Kerala}}\n{{Hindu Culture and Epics}}\n{{Worship in Hinduism}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Thiruvananthapuram district]]\n[[Category:9th-century Hindu temples]]\n[[Category:Shiva temples in Kerala]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=September 2019}}\n{{Infobox Hindu temple\n| name               = Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple\n| image              = \n| alt          =\n| map_type        = India Kerala\n| map_caption        = Location in [[Kerala]]\n| coordinates        = {{coord|8|29|15|N|76|56|36|E|type:landmark_region:IN|display=inline,title}}\n| country            = India\n| state              = [[Kerala]]\n| district           = [[Thiruvananthapuram]]\n| location           = [[Sreekanteswaram]]\n| elevation_m        =\n| deity  = Lord [[Shiva]]\n| facade_direction = \n| temple_tank        = \n| tower              = \n| festivals= Maha Shivaratri\n| architecture       = [[Dravidian architecture]] ([[Kovil]])\n| temple_quantity  =\n| monument_quantity=\n| inscriptions       =\n| creator            =\n| website            =\n}}\n'''Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple''' or '''Old Sreekanteswaram Temple''', located at [[Puthenchantha]] in [[Thiruvananthapuram]], is one of the ancient [[Shiva|Shiva temple]]s in [[Kerala]].

Before it was taken over by the Board, the temple belonged to a prominent [[Nair]] [[tharavad]] by name Kovilvila.\n\n==Darsan==\n* Morning - 5.00 to 10.30\n* Evening - 5.00 to 8.00\n* Monday & Thursday \n* Morning - 5.00 to 11.00\n* Evening - 5.00 to 8.00\n\n==Kovilvila Tharavad==\nKovilvila Tharavad traces its roots to Valluvanad. Centuries ago, the nair tharavad had a [[Karanavar]] who was an advanced upasaka of Srividya sampradaya. He and his wife used a Meru [[Sri Yantra|Sreechakram]] for their worship. They had many disciples. Though they were revered by the people around, they were not in the good books of the ruler. Due to royal displeasure, the members of the tharavad had to flee to Pattazhi. From Pattazhi they moved to Thiruvananthapuram and settled there. The Karanavar and his wife continued their [[upasana]] in the land of Sri Padmanabha. After leading fruitful lives they reached the Divine Abode of [[Tripura Sundari|Lalita Parameswari]].\n\nIn course of time the family began to manage the affairs of Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple. Years rolled by. Besides Sreechakram, the family started worshipping [[Bhadrakali]] of a [[kalari]] and the great Karanavar who had attained the lotus-feet of the Divine Mother. By the blessings of Sreekanteswara and the Household Deities, the family prospered and reached great heights. But succeeding generations did not have the required degree of piety. The family is believed to have incurred the wrath of the Guardian Deities. Kovilvila House, along with the chamber in which the Guardian Deities were installed, was reduced to ashes. Though the tharavad managed to rise from the ashes, it did not resume the upasana for many years.\n\n==Kovilvila Bhagavati Temple==\nAfter an elaborate Ashtamangala Prasnam in December 2006, a new temple by the name Kovilvila Bhagavati Temple was constructed in a piece of land adjacent to Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram. This piece of land belonged to Kovilvila L Parukkutti Amma, the wife of Justice K. S. Govinda Pillai. The Guardian Deities of the tharavad - Kalari Bhadrakali, Meru Sreechakram, and Karanavar - were duly installed by the Tantri Thrippunithura Puliyannoor Murali Narayanan Nambuthiripad on 21 March 2008. One-hooded [[Nagaraja]], five-hooded Nagayakshi  and Chitrakootam were installed by Amedamangalathu Vishnu Nambuthiri on the next day.\n\nOffering Neyvilakku for eleven consecutive days is the most important vazhipadu in the Temple.\n\nBeing the day of installation of the Goddess, ''Uthram'' in the month of ''Meenom'', is the most important day in the temple calendar. Women devotees offer [[Pongala]]  on that day. ''Ayilyam'' in the month of ''Thulam'' is important for the Serpent gods.\n\n==Murals in Kovilvila Bhagavati Temple==\nThe Temple has in it grand mural paintings of Kalari Bhadrakali and Lalita Parameswari. According to Dr. M.G.Sasibhooshan, the mural of Lalita Parameswari is one of the largest of its kind.\n\n==Darsan==\n* Morning - 6.00 to 9.30\n* Evening - 5.30 to 7.30\n\n==Royal visit==\nPrincess [[Aswathi Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi]] visited Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple and Kovilvila Bhagavati Temple on 5 November 2013.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Hindu temples in Kerala]]\n* [[Kappazhom Raman Pillai]]\n* [[Sreekanteswaram Mahadeva Temple]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Articles Related to Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram Temple\n|list =\n{{Hindu temples in Kerala}}\n{{Hindu Culture and Epics}}\n{{Worship in Hinduism}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Thiruvananthapuram district]]\n[[Category:9th-century Hindu temples]]\n[[Category:Shiva temples in Kerala]]\n", "name_user": "G3Sasi", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazhaya_Sreekanteswaram_Temple"}
