A [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version had been planned but was cancelled during development. The game received [[List of video games notable for negative reception|negative reviews from critics]] and is known as one of the [[List of commercial failures in video games|major commercial failures of the video game industry]].\n\nThe [[Daikatana (Game Boy Color)|Game Boy Color game of the same name]] released the same year is entirely different, being a top-down [[action-adventure game]] by Japanese studio [[Kemco]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Daikatana gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|Gameplay of ''Daikatana''.]]\n''Daikatana'' is composed of 24 [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] (18 in the console versions) divided into four episodes, with a varying number of levels per episode. Each episode represents a different location and time period: 25th century Japan in 2455&nbsp;AD, [[ancient Greece]] in 1200&nbsp;BC, the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in Norway in 560&nbsp;AD, and near-future [[San Francisco]] in 2030&nbsp;AD.\n\nOne element that ''Daikatana'' stressed was the important role of Hiro Miyamoto's two sidekicks, Mikiko Ebihara and Superfly Johnson. The death of either sidekick resulted in failing the level, and their assistance was required to complete certain puzzles. Due to poor [[Game artificial intelligence|AI]] implementation, the sidekicks, who were one of the game's selling points, became a focus of criticism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-top-7-pr-disasters/?page=5 |title=The Top 7...

The Mishima go to the swordmaster Usagi Miyamoto to craft a weapon to end the conflict: the Daikatana. However, Usagi realizes the Mishimas' dark desires and gives the Daikatana to the Ebihara; Inshiro Ebihara throws the sword into a volcano at the end of the war.\n\nIn 2455 AD, swordmaster Hiro Miyamoto is visited by a man named Dr. Toshiro Ebihara, a descendant of Inshiro who is suffering from a plague and about to die. Toshiro tells Hiro that Kage Mishima, the ruler of the planet, took over the world by stealing the Daikatana and using it to alter history. He stole the cure to a viral plague in 2030 and uses the cure to control the world's population. Mikiko Ebihara, Toshiro's daughter, has been captured when trying to steal back the Daikatana, and Hiro must rescue her and fix history.\n\nHiro storms the Mishima's headquarters where he rescues Mikiko as well as Superfly Johnson, the Mishima's head of security who rebelled when he grew sick of the Mishima's brutal totalitarian practices. Mikiko and Superfly join Hiro in his quest and steal the Daikatana. The Mishima encounters the trio as the trio steal the sword, wielding a second Daikatana. The Mishima sends the trio back in time to Ancient Greece. Hiro and Mikiko defeat Medusa, recharging the Daikatana as it absorbs Medusa's power. The three time jump once more, only to encounter the Mishima again and be sent through time to the Dark Ages, stranded as the Daikatana has run out of energy.\n\nThe group finds a sorcerer named Musilde who offers to recharge the Daikatana if Hiro, Superfly, and Mikiko can save his village from the black plague. To do this, the group must defeat the necromancer Nharre, reassemble the Purifier, a magical sword, and use it to restore King Gharroth's sanity so that he may use the sword to put an end to the plague. When King Gharroth recharges the Daikatana, Hiro and his allies time jump again, finally ending up in 2030, where San Francisco has fallen to gangs and martial law has been declared by the military and the Mishima.\n\nThe trio fights their way through a naval base where the Mishima is working on weapons. The ghost of Usagi enters Hiro's body and gives him full control over the Daikatana. With Usagi's knowledge and skills with the sword, Hiro slays the Mishima. One of the Daikatana disappears, as its timeline no longer exists.\n\nMikiko steals the remaining Daikatana and kills Superfly, revealing that the feudal Ebihara clan was just as evil as the Mishimas. She announces her intentions to use the Daikatana to restore the honor of her ancient clan and take over the world. Hiro defeats and kills Mikiko, then uses the Daikatana to fix history once and for all. The Daikatana is never found in 2455, the viral plague is cured in 2030, the Mishima never take over the world, and Hiro exiles himself to a forgotten corner of the space-time continuum, safeguarding the Daikatana to ensure that it never falls into the hands of evil.\n\n==Development==\n[[Image:John Romero - Jason Scott interview (6951215353) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ion Storm co-founder and ''Daikatana'' creator [[John Romero]] (pictured 2012)]]\n''Daikatana'' was created by [[John Romero]], an influential developer whose resume included founding titles in the [[first-person shooter]] genre (''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'') when he worked at [[id Software]].

The game received [[List of video games notable for negative reception|negative reviews from critics]] and is known as one of the [[List of commercial failures in video games|major commercial failures of the video game industry]].\n\nThe [[Daikatana (Game Boy Color)|Game Boy Color game of the same name]] released the same year is entirely different, being a top-down [[action-adventure game]] by Japanese studio [[Kemco]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Daikatana gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|Gameplay of ''Daikatana''.]]\n''Daikatana'' is composed of 24 [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] (18 in the console versions) divided into four episodes, with a varying number of levels per episode. Each episode represents a different location and time period: 25th century Japan in 2455&nbsp;AD, [[ancient Greece]] in 1200&nbsp;BC, the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in Norway in 560&nbsp;AD, and near-future [[San Francisco]] in 2030&nbsp;AD.\n\nOne element that ''Daikatana'' stressed was the important role of Hiro Miyamoto's two sidekicks, Mikiko Ebihara and Superfly Johnson. The death of either sidekick resulted in failing the level, and their assistance was required to complete certain puzzles. Due to poor [[Game artificial intelligence|AI]] implementation, the sidekicks, who were one of the game's selling points, became a focus of criticism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-top-7-pr-disasters/?page=5 |title=The Top 7...

The Mishima go to the swordmaster Usagi Miyamoto to craft a weapon to end the conflict: the Daikatana. However, Usagi realizes the Mishimas' dark desires and gives the Daikatana to the Ebihara; Inshiro Ebihara throws the sword into a volcano at the end of the war.\n\nIn 2455 AD, swordmaster Hiro Miyamoto is visited by a man named Dr. Toshiro Ebihara, a descendant of Inshiro who is suffering from a plague and about to die. Toshiro tells Hiro that Kage Mishima, the ruler of the planet, took over the world by stealing the Daikatana and using it to alter history. He stole the cure to a viral plague in 2030 and uses the cure to control the world's population. Mikiko Ebihara, Toshiro's daughter, has been captured when trying to steal back the Daikatana, and Hiro must rescue her and fix history.\n\nHiro storms the Mishima's headquarters where he rescues Mikiko as well as Superfly Johnson, the Mishima's head of security who rebelled when he grew sick of the Mishima's brutal totalitarian practices. Mikiko and Superfly join Hiro in his quest and steal the Daikatana. The Mishima encounters the trio as the trio steal the sword, wielding a second Daikatana. The Mishima sends the trio back in time to Ancient Greece. Hiro and Mikiko defeat Medusa, recharging the Daikatana as it absorbs Medusa's power. The three time jump once more, only to encounter the Mishima again and be sent through time to the Dark Ages, stranded as the Daikatana has run out of energy.\n\nThe group finds a sorcerer named Musilde who offers to recharge the Daikatana if Hiro, Superfly, and Mikiko can save his village from the black plague. To do this, the group must defeat the necromancer Nharre, reassemble the Purifier, a magical sword, and use it to restore King Gharroth's sanity so that he may use the sword to put an end to the plague. When King Gharroth recharges the Daikatana, Hiro and his allies time jump again, finally ending up in 2030, where San Francisco has fallen to gangs and martial law has been declared by the military and the Mishima.\n\nThe trio fights their way through a naval base where the Mishima is working on weapons. The ghost of Usagi enters Hiro's body and gives him full control over the Daikatana. With Usagi's knowledge and skills with the sword, Hiro slays the Mishima. One of the Daikatana disappears, as its timeline no longer exists.\n\nMikiko steals the remaining Daikatana and kills Superfly, revealing that the feudal Ebihara clan was just as evil as the Mishimas. She announces her intentions to use the Daikatana to restore the honor of her ancient clan and take over the world. Hiro defeats and kills Mikiko, then uses the Daikatana to fix history once and for all. The Daikatana is never found in 2455, the viral plague is cured in 2030, the Mishima never take over the world, and Hiro exiles himself to a forgotten corner of the space-time continuum, safeguarding the Daikatana to ensure that it never falls into the hands of evil.\n\n==Development==\n[[Image:John Romero - Jason Scott interview (6951215353) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ion Storm co-founder and ''Daikatana'' creator [[John Romero]] (pictured 2012)]]\n''Daikatana'' was created by [[John Romero]], an influential developer whose resume included founding titles in the [[first-person shooter]] genre (''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'') when he worked at [[id Software]].

I do not conclude from this absence of evidence that the Phoenicians did not exist, nor that nobody ever called her- or himself a Phoenician under any circumstances: Phoenician-speakers undoubtedly had a larger repertoire of self-classifications than survives in our fragmentary evidence, and it would be surprising if, for instance, they never described themselves as Phoenicians to the Greeks who invented that term; indeed, I have drawn attention to several cases where something very close to that is going on... A distaste even for self-government could also explain a phenomenon I have drawn attention to throughout the book: our \u201cPhoenicians\u201d not only fail to visibly identify as Phoenician, they often omit to identify at all. It is striking in this light that the first surviving visible expression of an explicitly \u201cPhoenician\u201d identity was imposed by the Carthaginians on their subjects as they extended state power to a degree unprecedented among Phoenician-speakers, that it was then adopted by Tyre as a symbol of colonial success, and that it was subsequently exploited by Roman rulers in support of their imperial activities.}}</ref> In terms of culture, language, lifestyle, and religion there was little to set the Phoenicians significantly apart from other residents of the Levant.<ref name=\"Quinn24204\">{{cite book|author=Josephine Quinn|authorlink=Josephine Crawley Quinn|title=In Search of the Phoenicians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8QAuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|date=11 December 2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-8911-2|page=24, 204|quote=My answer to the question Moscati posed in 1963 is that nothing did in fact unite the Phoenicians in their own eyes or those of their neighbors, and that his Phoenician people, or civilization, or nation, is not actually a real historical object, but rather a product of the scholarly and political ideologies I have discussed in this chapter. Such modern ideas about the ancient Phoenicians are thoroughly interwoven with ideas about the modern nation-state. That does not in itself, of course, mean that they cannot also be true.

In the resulting power vacuum, a number of Phoenician cities rose as significant maritime powers.\n\nPhoenician societies rested on three power-bases: the king; temples and their priests; and councils of elders. [[Byblos]] first became the predominant center from where the Phoenicians dominated the Mediterranean and Erythraean (Red) Sea routes.

The [[rise of Macedon]] gradually ousted the remnants of Phoenicia's former dominance over the Eastern Mediterranean trade routes. Between 286 and 197&nbsp;BC, Phoenicia (except for Aradus) fell to the Ptolemies of Egypt, who installed the high priests of [[Astarte]] as vassal rulers in Sidon ([[Eshmunazar I]], [[Tabnit]], [[Eshmunazar II]]).\n\nIn 197&nbsp;BC, Phoenicia along with Syria reverted to the [[Seleucids]]. The region became increasingly Hellenized, although Tyre became autonomous in 126&nbsp;BC, followed by Sidon in 111. While Phoenician culture disappeared entirely in the motherland, Carthage continued to flourish in Northwest Africa. It oversaw the mining of iron and [[precious metal]]s from Iberia, and used its considerable naval power and mercenary armies to protect commercial interests, until Rome finally destroyed it in 146&nbsp;BC at the end of the [[Punic Wars]].\n\nSyria, including Phoenicia, was seized and ruled by king [[Tigranes the Great]] of [[Armenia]] from 82 until 69&nbsp;BC, when he was defeated by [[Lucullus]].

At first, they traded mainly with the Greeks, trading [[wood]], [[slave]]s, [[glass]] and powdered [[Tyrian purple]]. Tyrian purple was a violet-purple dye used by the Greek [[elite]] to color garments. As trading and colonizing spread over the Mediterranean, Phoenicians and Greeks seemed to have split that sea in two: the Phoenicians sailed along and eventually dominated the southern shore, while the Greeks were active along the northern shores. The two cultures rarely clashed, mainly in the [[Sicilian Wars]], and eventually settled into two spheres of influence, the Phoenician in the west and the Greek to the east.\n\nIn the centuries after 1200&nbsp;BC, the Phoenicians were the major naval and trading power of the region. Phoenician trade was founded on the Tyrian purple dye, a violet-purple dye derived from the [[hypobranchial gland]] of the ''[[Murex]]'' sea-snail, once profusely available in coastal waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea but exploited to local extinction. [[James B. Pritchard]]'s excavations at [[Sarepta]] in present-day [[Lebanon]] revealed crushed ''Murex'' shells and pottery containers stained with the dye that was being produced at the site. The Phoenicians established a second production center for the dye in [[Mogador]], in present-day [[Morocco]]. Brilliant textiles were a part of Phoenician wealth, and Phoenician [[glass]] was another export ware.\n\nTo Egypt, where grapevines would not grow, the 8th-century Phoenicians sold [[wine]]: the wine trade with Egypt is vividly documented by the shipwrecks located in 1997 in the open sea {{convert|50|km|-1}} west of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref>{{cite book |first=L.

From Egypt, the Phoenicians bought [[Nubia]]n gold. Additionally, great cedar logs were traded with lumber-poor Egypt for significant sums. Sometime between 1075 and 1060 BC an Egyptian envoy by the name of Wen-Amon visited Phoenicia and secured seven great cedar logs in exchange for a mixed cargo including \"4 crocks and 1 kak-men of gold; 5 silver jugs; 10 garments of royal linen; 10 kherd of good linen from Upper Egypt; 500 rolls of finished papyrus; 500 cows' hides; 500 ropes; 20 bags of lentils and 30 baskets of fish.\" Those logs were then moved by ship from Phoenicia to Egypt.{{sfnp|Cunliffe|2008|pp=241\u20132}}\n\nFrom elsewhere, they obtained other materials, perhaps the most important being [[silver]] from (at least) [[Sardinia]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Tin was required which, when smelted with copper from Cyprus, created the durable metal alloy bronze. The archaeologist Glenn Markoe suggests that tin \"may have been acquired from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] by way of the Atlantic coast or southern Spain; alternatively, it may have come from northern Europe ([[Cornwall]] or [[Brittany]]) via the [[Rhone valley]] and coastal [[Marseille|Massalia]]\".{{sfnp|Markoe|2000|p=103}} [[Strabo]] states that there was a highly lucrative Phoenician trade with Britain for tin via the [[Cassiterides]] whose location is unknown but may have been off the northwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula.<ref>Christopher Hawkes, \"Britain and Julius Caesar,\" Proceedings of the British Academy 63 (1977) 124\u2013192</ref> Professor Timothy Champion, discussing Diodorus Siculus's comments on the tin trade, states that \"Diodorus never actually says that the Phoenicians sailed to Cornwall. In fact, he says quite the opposite: the production of [[Mining in Cornwall and Devon|Cornish tin]] was in the hands of the natives of Cornwall, and its transport to the Mediterranean was organised by local merchants, by sea and then over land through France, well outside Phoenician control.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Champion |first=Timothy |title=The appropriation of the Phoenicians in British imperial ideology |journal=Nations and Nationalism |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=451\u2013465 |doi=10.1111/1469-8219.00027 |year=2001 }}</ref>\n\n[[Tarshish]] ({{lang-he|\u05ea\u05b7\u05bc\u05e8\u05b0\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1}}) occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings, and one of the most recurring is that Tarshish is a place, probably a city or country, that is far from the [[Land of Israel]] by sea where trade occurs with Israel and Phoenicia.

Ancient Gaelic mythologies attribute a Phoenician/Scythian influx to Ireland by a leader called [[Fenius Farsa]]. Others also sailed south along the coast of Africa. A Carthaginian expedition led by [[Hanno the Navigator]] explored and colonized the Atlantic coast of Africa as far as the [[Gulf of Guinea]]; and according to Herodotus, a Phoenician expedition sent down the [[Red Sea]] by pharaoh [[Necho II]] of Egypt ({{circa|600&nbsp;BC}}) even [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] Africa and returned through the [[Pillars of Hercules]] after three years.\n\nIn the [[2nd millennium BC]], the Phoenicians traded with the [[Maritime history of Somalia|Somalis]].

These names are readily explained by depictions of Phoenician ships in the palaces of Assyrian kings from the 7th and 8th centuries, as the ships in these images are tub shaped (''{{lang|grc-Latn|galloi}}'') and have horse heads on the ends of them (''{{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}}''). It is possible that these ''{{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}}'' come from Phoenician connections with the Greek god [[Poseidon]] equated with the Semitic God \"[[Yam (god)|Yam]]\".\n\nIn 2014, a Phoenician trading ship, dating to 700 BC, was found near [[Gozo]] island.

The catalyst for such dramatic change in Punic religious practice was their recent defeat in war when led by their king Himilco (d. 396) against the Greeks of Sicily.<ref>{{harvp|Lancel|1995|p=114}}: Himilco's acts of sacrilege and his subsequent military defeat in Sicily, later his penance and suicide at Carthage; thereafter, introduction to Carthage of Greek goddesses Demeter and Kore.</ref>\n\nSuch transformation of religion would have been instigated by a faction of wealthy land owners at Carthage, including these reforms: overthrow of the monarchy; elevation of Tanit as queen goddess and decline of Baal Hammon; allowance of foreign cults of Greek origin into the city ([[Demeter]] and [[Persephone|Kore]]); decline in child sacrifice, with most votive victims changed to small animals, and with the sacrifice not directed for state purposes but, when infrequently done, performed to solicit the deity for private, family favors. This bold historical interpretation understands the reformer's motivation as \"the reaction of a wealthy and cultured upper class against the primitive and antiquated aspects of the Canaanite religion, and also a political move intended to break the power of a monarchy which ruled by divine authority.\" The reform's popularity was precarious at first. Later, when the city was in danger of imminent attack in 310, there would be a marked regression to child sacrifice. Yet eventually the cosmopolitan religious reform and the popular worship of Tanit together contributed to \"breaking through the wall of isolation which had surrounded Carthage.\"{{sfnp|Charles-Picard|Picard|1968|pp=146\u201354}}<ref>{{harvp|Lancel|1995|pp=202\u20133}}, shows his criticism of the theory that Tanit was adopted in Carthage when it passed from monarchy to oligarchy.</ref><ref>Giovanni Garbini, \"Continuit\u00e0 ed innovazioni nella religione fenicia\" in ''Atti del colloquio in Roma: la religione fenicia'' (Roma 1981) pp 34\u20136.

In a shipwreck found off of the coast of Turkey (the Ulu Bulurun wreck), Canaanite storage pottery along with pottery from Cyprus and Greece was found.

New York: Bookman Associates</ref> Baal, on the other hand, is a representative for order. In Ugaritic myth, Baal overcomes Yamm's power. In some versions of this myth, Baal kills Yamm with a mace fashioned for him, and in others, the goddess Athtart saves Yamm and says that since defeated, he should stay in his own province.

A distaste even for self-government could also explain a phenomenon I have drawn attention to throughout the book: our \u201cPhoenicians\u201d not only fail to visibly identify as Phoenician, they often omit to identify at all. It is striking in this light that the first surviving visible expression of an explicitly \u201cPhoenician\u201d identity was imposed by the Carthaginians on their subjects as they extended state power to a degree unprecedented among Phoenician-speakers, that it was then adopted by Tyre as a symbol of colonial success, and that it was subsequently exploited by Roman rulers in support of their imperial activities.}}</ref> In terms of culture, language, lifestyle, and religion there was little to set the Phoenicians significantly apart from other residents of the Levant.<ref name=\"Quinn24204\">{{cite book|author=Josephine Quinn|authorlink=Josephine Crawley Quinn|title=In Search of the Phoenicians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8QAuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|date=11 December 2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-8911-2|page=24, 204|quote=My answer to the question Moscati posed in 1963 is that nothing did in fact unite the Phoenicians in their own eyes or those of their neighbors, and that his Phoenician people, or civilization, or nation, is not actually a real historical object, but rather a product of the scholarly and political ideologies I have discussed in this chapter. Such modern ideas about the ancient Phoenicians are thoroughly interwoven with ideas about the modern nation-state. That does not in itself, of course, mean that they cannot also be true.

Around 1200&nbsp;BC, a series of [[Late Bronze Age collapse|poorly-understood events]] weakened and destroyed the adjacent [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Collapse of the Hittite Empire|Hittite]] empires. In the resulting power vacuum, a number of Phoenician cities rose as significant maritime powers.\n\nPhoenician societies rested on three power-bases: the king; temples and their priests; and councils of elders. [[Byblos]] first became the predominant center from where the Phoenicians dominated the Mediterranean and Erythraean (Red) Sea routes. It was here that the first inscription in the Phoenician alphabet was found, on the sarcophagus of [[Ahiram]] (c. 1200&nbsp;BC).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nLater, [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in [[Lebanon|South Lebanon]] gained in power.

The [[rise of Macedon]] gradually ousted the remnants of Phoenicia's former dominance over the Eastern Mediterranean trade routes. Between 286 and 197&nbsp;BC, Phoenicia (except for Aradus) fell to the Ptolemies of Egypt, who installed the high priests of [[Astarte]] as vassal rulers in Sidon ([[Eshmunazar I]], [[Tabnit]], [[Eshmunazar II]]).\n\nIn 197&nbsp;BC, Phoenicia along with Syria reverted to the [[Seleucids]]. The region became increasingly Hellenized, although Tyre became autonomous in 126&nbsp;BC, followed by Sidon in 111. While Phoenician culture disappeared entirely in the motherland, Carthage continued to flourish in Northwest Africa. It oversaw the mining of iron and [[precious metal]]s from Iberia, and used its considerable naval power and mercenary armies to protect commercial interests, until Rome finally destroyed it in 146&nbsp;BC at the end of the [[Punic Wars]].\n\nSyria, including Phoenicia, was seized and ruled by king [[Tigranes the Great]] of [[Armenia]] from 82 until 69&nbsp;BC, when he was defeated by [[Lucullus]].

At first, they traded mainly with the Greeks, trading [[wood]], [[slave]]s, [[glass]] and powdered [[Tyrian purple]]. Tyrian purple was a violet-purple dye used by the Greek [[elite]] to color garments. As trading and colonizing spread over the Mediterranean, Phoenicians and Greeks seemed to have split that sea in two: the Phoenicians sailed along and eventually dominated the southern shore, while the Greeks were active along the northern shores. The two cultures rarely clashed, mainly in the [[Sicilian Wars]], and eventually settled into two spheres of influence, the Phoenician in the west and the Greek to the east.\n\nIn the centuries after 1200&nbsp;BC, the Phoenicians were the major naval and trading power of the region. Phoenician trade was founded on the Tyrian purple dye, a violet-purple dye derived from the [[hypobranchial gland]] of the ''[[Murex]]'' sea-snail, once profusely available in coastal waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea but exploited to local extinction. [[James B. Pritchard]]'s excavations at [[Sarepta]] in present-day [[Lebanon]] revealed crushed ''Murex'' shells and pottery containers stained with the dye that was being produced at the site. The Phoenicians established a second production center for the dye in [[Mogador]], in present-day [[Morocco]]. Brilliant textiles were a part of Phoenician wealth, and Phoenician [[glass]] was another export ware.\n\nTo Egypt, where grapevines would not grow, the 8th-century Phoenicians sold [[wine]]: the wine trade with Egypt is vividly documented by the shipwrecks located in 1997 in the open sea {{convert|50|km|-1}} west of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref>{{cite book |first=L.

From Egypt, the Phoenicians bought [[Nubia]]n gold. Additionally, great cedar logs were traded with lumber-poor Egypt for significant sums. Sometime between 1075 and 1060 BC an Egyptian envoy by the name of Wen-Amon visited Phoenicia and secured seven great cedar logs in exchange for a mixed cargo including \"4 crocks and 1 kak-men of gold; 5 silver jugs; 10 garments of royal linen; 10 kherd of good linen from Upper Egypt; 500 rolls of finished papyrus; 500 cows' hides; 500 ropes; 20 bags of lentils and 30 baskets of fish.\" Those logs were then moved by ship from Phoenicia to Egypt.{{sfnp|Cunliffe|2008|pp=241\u20132}}\n\nFrom elsewhere, they obtained other materials, perhaps the most important being [[silver]] from (at least) [[Sardinia]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Tin was required which, when smelted with copper from Cyprus, created the durable metal alloy bronze. The archaeologist Glenn Markoe suggests that tin \"may have been acquired from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] by way of the Atlantic coast or southern Spain; alternatively, it may have come from northern Europe ([[Cornwall]] or [[Brittany]]) via the [[Rhone valley]] and coastal [[Marseille|Massalia]]\".{{sfnp|Markoe|2000|p=103}} [[Strabo]] states that there was a highly lucrative Phoenician trade with Britain for tin via the [[Cassiterides]] whose location is unknown but may have been off the northwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula.<ref>Christopher Hawkes, \"Britain and Julius Caesar,\" Proceedings of the British Academy 63 (1977) 124\u2013192</ref> Professor Timothy Champion, discussing Diodorus Siculus's comments on the tin trade, states that \"Diodorus never actually says that the Phoenicians sailed to Cornwall.

It is possible that these ''{{lang|grc-Latn|hippoi}}'' come from Phoenician connections with the Greek god [[Poseidon]] equated with the Semitic God \"[[Yam (god)|Yam]]\".\n\nIn 2014, a Phoenician trading ship, dating to 700 BC, was found near [[Gozo]] island.

She is the daughter of El, the god of heaven, and of his wife the Lady Asherah of the Sea. ... Her foremost lover was her brother [[Hadad|Baal]]. ... She was easily provoked to violence and, once she began to fight, would go berserk, smiting and killing left and right.\" (60\u20132), who adds that the Phoenician [[Philo of Byblos]] (64\u2013141) compared Anath to the Greek virgin war goddess [[Athena]]. Also, Patai at 63\u20136 identifies Anath with the biblical \"Queen of Heaven\". At 61 Patai, referring to Anath in her r\u00f4le as goddess of love, mentions the Babylonian goddess [[Ishtar]], and remarks that both Astarte and Anath as \"typical goddesses of love, both chaste and promiscuous... [were] perennially fruitful without ever losing their virginity.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"Asherah was the chief goddess of the Canaanite pantheon... at Ugarit... . ...Asherah figured prominently as the wife of El the chief god. Her full name was 'Lady Asherah of the Sea'--apparently her domain proper was the sea, just as that of her husband El was heaven. She was, however, also referred to simply as Elath or Goddess.

And whatever [our] explanation or interpretation does to it, we do to our souls as well, with corresponding results for our own well being. ... Hence the \"explanation\" should always be such that the functional significance of the archetype remains unimpaired, so that an adequate and meaningful connection between the conscious mind and the archetype is assured. ... It represents or personifies certain instinctive data of the dark, primitive psyche, the real but invisible roots of consciousness.\" ... \"The archetype... is a psychic organ present in all of us. ... There is no 'rational' substitute for the archetype any more than there is for the cerebellum or the kidneys.\"</blockquote></ref>\n\nA problematic theory derived from [[sociology of religion]] proposes that as Carthage passed from being a Phoenician trading station into a wealthy and sovereign city-state, and from a monarchy anchored to Tyre into a native-born ''Libyphoenician'' oligarchy, Carthaginians began to turn away from deities associated with Phoenicia, and slowly to discover or synthesize a Punic deity, the goddess Tanit.<ref>Compare {{harvp|Lancel|1995|pp=202\u20133}}.</ref> A parallel theory posits that when Carthage acquired as a source of wealth substantial agricultural lands in Africa, a local fertility goddess, Tanit, developed or evolved eventually to become supreme.<ref name=\"Abun-Nasr, 1971\"/> A basis for such theories may well be the religious reform movement that emerged and prevailed at Carthage during the years 397-360. The catalyst for such dramatic change in Punic religious practice was their recent defeat in war when led by their king Himilco (d. 396) against the Greeks of Sicily.<ref>{{harvp|Lancel|1995|p=114}}: Himilco's acts of sacrilege and his subsequent military defeat in Sicily, later his penance and suicide at Carthage; thereafter, introduction to Carthage of Greek goddesses Demeter and Kore.</ref>\n\nSuch transformation of religion would have been instigated by a faction of wealthy land owners at Carthage, including these reforms: overthrow of the monarchy; elevation of Tanit as queen goddess and decline of Baal Hammon; allowance of foreign cults of Greek origin into the city ([[Demeter]] and [[Persephone|Kore]]); decline in child sacrifice, with most votive victims changed to small animals, and with the sacrifice not directed for state purposes but, when infrequently done, performed to solicit the deity for private, family favors. This bold historical interpretation understands the reformer's motivation as \"the reaction of a wealthy and cultured upper class against the primitive and antiquated aspects of the Canaanite religion, and also a political move intended to break the power of a monarchy which ruled by divine authority.\" The reform's popularity was precarious at first. Later, when the city was in danger of imminent attack in 310, there would be a marked regression to child sacrifice.

The Phoenicians were famous metalworkers, and by the end of the 8th century BC, Greek city-states were sending out envoys to the Levant (the eastern Mediterranean) for metal goods.<ref name=\"UPennMuseum\">{{cite web |year=1999 |title=Canaan and Ancient Palestine |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]\n |url=http://www.penn.museum/sites/canaan/index.html }} See also [http://www.penn.museum/exhibitions/signature-galleries/canaan-and-israel-gallery Gallery].</ref>\n\nThe height of Phoenician trade was circa the 7th and 8th centuries BC. There is a dispersal of imports (ceramic, stone, and faience) from the Levant that traces a Phoenician commercial channel to the Greek mainland via the central Aegean.{{r|UPennMuseum}} Athens shows little evidence of this trade with few eastern imports, but other Greek coastal cities are rich with eastern imports that evidence this trade.{{sfnp|Markoe|2000|p=174}}\n\nAl Mina is a specific example of the trade that took place between the Greeks and the Phoenicians.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Boardman |first1=John |authorlink=John Boardman (art historian) |year=1964 |title=The Greeks Overseas |location=London |publisher=Thames and Hudson |ref=harv }}</ref> It has been theorized that by the 8th century BC, Euboean traders established a commercial enterprise with the Levantine coast and were using Al Mina (in Syria) as a base for this enterprise. There is still some question about the veracity of these claims concerning Al Mina.{{sfnp|Markoe|2000|p=174}} The Phoenicians even got their name from the Greeks due to their trade.

This most likely did not come from a single instance but from a culmination of commercial exchange.{{sfnp|Moscati|1965}} This means that before the 8th century, there was a relationship between the Greeks and the Phoenicians. Though there is no evidence to support the suggestion, it is probable that during this period there was also a passing of religious ideas.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The legendary Phoenician [[hero]] [[Cadmus]] is credited with bringing the alphabet to Greece, but it is more plausible that it was brought by Phoenician emigrants to [[Crete]],<ref>L.H.Jeffery.

This figure of \"Poseidon-Neptune\" is mentioned by authors and in various inscriptions as being very important to merchants and sailors,<ref>{{cite book |last=Ribichini |first=S. |year=1988 |chapter=Beliefs and Religious Life |editor=Sabatino Moscati |title=The Phoenicians |pp=104\u201325 |location=Milan |publisher=Gruppo Editoriale Fabbri }}</ref> but a singular name has yet to be found. There are, however, names for sea gods from individual city-states. Yamm is the god of the sea of [[Ugarit]], an ancient city-state north to Phoenicia. Yamm and Baal, the storm god of Ugaritic myth and often associated with Zeus, have an epic battle for power over the universe. While Yamm is the god of the sea, he truly represents vast chaos.<ref>Habel, N.C. 1964. ''Yahweh Versus Baal: A Conflict of Religious Cultures''. New York: Bookman Associates</ref> Baal, on the other hand, is a representative for order. In Ugaritic myth, Baal overcomes Yamm's power. In some versions of this myth, Baal kills Yamm with a mace fashioned for him, and in others, the goddess Athtart saves Yamm and says that since defeated, he should stay in his own province. Yamm is the brother of the god of death, Mot.<ref>Ringgren, H. 1917. ''Religions of the Ancient Near East''.

While docked at a trading port in Argos, the Phoenicians [[Raptio|kidnapped]] a group of Greek women including King Idacus's daughter, Io. The Greeks then retaliated by kidnapping Europa, a Phoenician, and later Medea. The Greeks refused to compensate the Phoenicians for the additional abduction, a fact which Paris used a generation later to justify the abduction of [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] from [[Argos]]. The Greeks then retaliated by waging war against Troy.

Regional offices guide this work and provide technical assistance to country offices as needed. Overall management and administration of the organization takes place its New York headquarters, where global policy on children is shaped. \n\nGuiding and monitoring all of UNICEF's work is an Executive Board made up of 36 members who are government representatives.

These five officers are elected by the Executive Board annually from among its members, with the presidency rotating among the regional groups on an annual basis. As a matter of custom, permanent members of the Security Council do not serve as officers of the Executive Board. \n\nThe Office of the Secretary of the Executive Board helps maintain an effective relationship between the Executive Board and the UNICEF secretariat, and organizes field visits by board members.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/structure/|title=How UNICEF works|work=UNICEF|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/execboard/|title=Home|work=UNICEF|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/execboard/index_13225.html|title=Bureau|work=UNICEF|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en-US}}</ref>[[File:1 school in a box.jpg|thumb|right|UNICEF ''School in a box'' contains basic educational items for one teacher and 40 students]]\n\n===UNICEF Regional Offices===\n\nThe following countries are home to UNICEF Regional Offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/structure/index_regional.html|title=UNICEF Regional Offices\n|date=2017-09-27|access-date=2020-02-26|work=UNICEF}}</ref>\n\n* The Americas and Caribbean Regional Office, [[Panama City]], [[Panama]]\n* Europe and Central Asia Regional Office, [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]\n* East Asia and the Pacific Regional Office, [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]\n* Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office, [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]\n* Middle East and North Africa Regional Office, [[Amman]], [[Jordan]]\n* South Asia Regional Office, [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]]\n* West and Central Africa Regional Office, [[Senegal]]\n\n==UNICEF national committees==\n{{see also|List of UNICEF National Committees}}\nThere are national committees in 36 developed countries, each established as an independent local [[non-governmental organization]].

Seven regional offices provide technical assistance to country offices as needed, while its Supply Division\u2014based in [[Copenhagen]] and [[New York City|New York\u2014]]<nowiki/>helps provide over $3 billion in critical aid and services.<ref name=\"SD\"/> \n\nIn 2018,  UNICEF assisted in the birth of 27 million babies, administered [[Pentavalent vaccine|Pentavalent vaccines]] to an estimated 65.5 million children, provided education for 12 million children, treated four million children with [[Severe Acute Malnutrition|severe acute malnutrition]], and responded to 285 humanitarian emergencies in 90 countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/reports/annual-report-2018|title=UNICEF annual report 2018|website=www.unicef.org|language=en|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref> UNICEF had received recognition for its work, including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1965, the [[Indira Gandhi Prize]] in 1989 and the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Princess of Asturias Award]] in 2006.\n\n== Governance ==\n[[File:Sudan Envoy - UNICEF Tent.jpg|250px|thumb|UNICEF-care tent in [[Sudan]]]]\nUNICEF relies on country offices to help carry out its work through a unique program of cooperation developed with the host government. The programs last five years and seek to develop practical strategies for fulfilling and protecting the rights of children and women. Regional offices guide this work and provide technical assistance to country offices as needed. Overall management and administration of the organization takes place its New York headquarters, where global policy on children is shaped. \n\nGuiding and monitoring all of UNICEF's work is an Executive Board made up of 36 members who are government representatives. The Board establishes policies, approve programs and decide on administrative and financial plans and budgets. Its work is coordinated by the Bureau, comprising the President and four Vice-Presidents, each officer representing one of the five regional groups. These five officers are elected by the Executive Board annually from among its members, with the presidency rotating among the regional groups on an annual basis. As a matter of custom, permanent members of the Security Council do not serve as officers of the Executive Board. \n\nThe Office of the Secretary of the Executive Board helps maintain an effective relationship between the Executive Board and the UNICEF secretariat, and organizes field visits by board members.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/structure/|title=How UNICEF works|work=UNICEF|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/execboard/|title=Home|work=UNICEF|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/execboard/index_13225.html|title=Bureau|work=UNICEF|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en-US}}</ref>[[File:1 school in a box.jpg|thumb|right|UNICEF ''School in a box'' contains basic educational items for one teacher and 40 students]]\n\n===UNICEF Regional Offices===\n\nThe following countries are home to UNICEF Regional Offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/structure/index_regional.html|title=UNICEF Regional Offices\n|date=2017-09-27|access-date=2020-02-26|work=UNICEF}}</ref>\n\n* The Americas and Caribbean Regional Office, [[Panama City]], [[Panama]]\n* Europe and Central Asia Regional Office, [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]\n* East Asia and the Pacific Regional Office, [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]\n* Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office, [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]\n* Middle East and North Africa Regional Office, [[Amman]], [[Jordan]]\n* South Asia Regional Office, [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]]\n* West and Central Africa Regional Office, [[Senegal]]\n\n==UNICEF national committees==\n{{see also|List of UNICEF National Committees}}\nThere are national committees in 36 developed countries, each established as an independent local [[non-governmental organization]].
