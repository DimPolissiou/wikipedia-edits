It was founded in 1938 by [[Stella Isaacs, Marchioness of Reading]], as a British women's organisation to recruit women into the [[Air Raid Precautions in the United Kingdom|Air Raid Precautions]] (ARP) services to help in the event of War.\n\n==Objectives==\nOn 16 May 1938, the British government set out the objectives of the '''Women's Voluntary Service for Civil Defence''':\n\nIt was seen \u201cas the enrolment of women for Air Raid Precaution Services of Local Authorities, to help to bring home to every household what air attack may mean, and to make known to every household [in the country] what it can do to protect itself and the community.\u201d\n\nIn the words of Home Secretary [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]], \"as regards their [[Civil defense|civil defence]] functions, the Minister regards the Women's Voluntary Service as occupying ... much the same relationship as that of the women's auxiliary services for the armed forces of the Crown.\"\n\n==Organisation and structure==\nThe WVS/WRVS was a voluntary organisation, and it was Lady Reading's vision that there would be no ranks. It was perhaps the only organisation where you could find a Duchess and a charlady working side by side. While many members of the WVS mucked in on pretty much all tasks, an organisation without any hierarchy would not have worked so, while there were no ranks, there were titles. Women were recruited for specific tasks, whether that was to drive ambulances, join in a knitting work party, or to collect National Savings. Inevitably those women who signed up for one thing often ended up being co-opted for other work, especially if they showed aptitude.\n\nThe WVS was split into 12 Regions (using the same boundaries as the [[Civil Defence Corps]]) which started with 1 in the NE of England and moved clockwise down the country and back up. Scotland was Region 11 and London Region 12. Each Region had a Regional Administrator who was paid for by the Home Office. Under this each county had a County Organiser and 'staff' and below that were the Centres. During and after the Second World War there were almost 2,000 WVS centres around Great Britain<ref>Lists of WVS centres up to 1965 can be found on the Royal Voluntary Service website: [http://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/Uploads/Documents/About%20us/Centres_England_by_county_and_centre.pdf England][http://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/Uploads/Documents/About%20us/Centres_Scotland_by_county_and_centre.pdf Scotland]\n[http://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/Uploads/Documents/About%20us/Centres_Wales_by_county_and_centre.pdf Wales]</ref> (and in Northern Ireland during the war), each at the sharp end of providing help to their communities. Each was prominently positioned within a town or village and was run by a Centre Organiser appointed by Headquarters in London. Each Centre Organiser had a team of members who were responsible for different aspect of WVS work e.g. evacuation, Training, Food or Clothing.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Women in Green|last = Graves|first = Charles|publisher = William Heinmann Ltd.|year = 1948|isbn = |location = |pages = 13}}</ref> Under their direction were the 'ordinary' members.\n\nWhile Centre Organisers had ultimate control over the work they did in their areas, they were tightly scrutinised by the County and Regional offices and Headquarters. Each Centre had to file a monthly Narrative Report in quadruplicate which allowed both the sharing of good practice and ideas, but also allowed those in charge to keep tabs on their members. These Narrative reports which were produced from 1938-1992 are inscribed on the [[UK Memory of the World Register]], part of [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme]] and are considered one of the most important documents for social and women's history produced in the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/Uploads/Documents/About%20us/narrative_reports_2013.pdf|title = WRVS Narrative Reports|date = 2010|accessdate = 10 December 2015|website = |publisher = Royal Voluntary Service|last = McMurray|first = Matthew}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unesco.org.uk/portfolio/memory-of-the-world|title=Memory of the World \u2013 UNESCO in the UK|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> In addition headquarters issued substantial numbers of circular notices each year informing Organisers of new projects and re-enforcing the rules and regulations.\n\nThis structure stayed in place almost unchanged until the Local Government reorganisations in the 1970s which changed boundaries and led to changes in regional organisation and the amalgamation and closure of some centres as District Councils were introduced. Through the 1990s cost-cutting and the professionalisation of the organisation meant that Centre Organisers and County and Regional Offices were phased out and the centres were closed. Headquarters which had been in London since 1938 was moved out to Milton Hill House in Oxfordshire in 1997 and by 2004 there were no local or regional centres remaining. The organisation of large areas (usually comprising several counties) and the services within them were taken on by members of staff and local services (such as Meals on Wheels, Darby and Joan clubs or Hospital Shops) were managed independently.\n\nIn 2013 Royal Voluntary Service resurrected the centre model, which are now called 'Hubs' and there are 67 spread across Great Britain.\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Evacuation, clothing distribution and returning soldiers===\n{{Main|Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II}}\nThe WVS played a key part in the evacuation of civilians from urban areas. The WVS had been asked to pinpoint areas of safety and billeting for evacuated children. Moving children out of the cities proved reasonably easy. Getting them to a known area of safety proved a lot more difficult as trains did not always arrive at an expected destination or would turn up at a reception point unexpectedly. The WVS is credited with helping to move 1.5 million people (the majority were children) out of cities in the early days of September 1939.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/02/how-a-formidable-female-army-assisted-the-biggest-mass-evacuation-in-the-uk |title=How a formidable female army assisted the biggest mass evacuation in the UK |newspaper=The Guardian|author=Caroline Davies |date= 2 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe WVS also played a major role in the collection of clothing required for the needy. In October 1939, Lady Reading broadcast to the United States about the need for clothing in the UK. The broadcast led to large quantities of clothing (known as \"[[British War Relief Society#Bundles for Britain|Bundles for Britain]]\") being sent by the [[American Red Cross]] and distributed from WVS Emergency Clothing Stores.\n\nWhen troops returned to ports after the [[evacuation at Dunkirk]], members of the WVS were there to greet them and hand out food, drink and warm clothing. The WVS base at the railway station in [[Headcorn|Headcorn, Kent]] was an especially busy place for feeding returning soldiers before they dispersed\u2014a spit was installed so that meat could be roasted on the spot. The WVS also played a vital part during [[the Blitz]] bombings of British cities.\n\n===The WVS during the Blitz===\n[[File:Blitz Canteen- Women of the Women's Voluntary Service Run a Mobile Canteen in London, England, 1941 D2173.jpg|thumb|Women of the Women's Voluntary Service run a Mobile Canteen in London, 1941]]\nBy the time of the Blitz, women in the WVS were adept at providing food and drink around the clock. While [[Air raid precautions|ARP]] wardens and firemen fought the fires, women in the WVS set up mobile canteens to keep them refreshed, thus placing themselves in serious physical danger with collapsing buildings a constant threat. When a raid ended, the WVS also played a part in looking after the injured and those who had lost their homes. Records indicate that the WVS dealt with and helped over 10,000 people every night of the Blitz.\n\nThe Blitz lasted for 57 nights, and the WVS helped a great many people who went to their rest centres. Some people stayed for a night; many stayed for much longer and stretched the resources of the WVS to the limit. In [[Barnes, London|Barnes]], one WVS member fed 1,200 bomb victims in just one day, cooking in her own kitchen.\n\nIt would be difficult to overstate the importance of the work done by the WVS during the Blitz: the rest centres provided shelter, food, and importantly, sanitation. But working so near to the centre of the bombing inevitably led to casualties. 241 members of the WVS were killed during the Blitz and many more were wounded. 25 WVS offices were destroyed.\n\n===Other activities===\nThe WVS began running IIPs (Incident Inquiry Points), places where people came to find out about their loved ones who were in an area that had been bombed in order to free the ARP to work with the fire brigade. The WVS also helped with the '''Queen's Messenger Food Convoys''' which took food to areas in need after a bombing raid. The people who survived the bombing of [[Coventry Blitz|Coventry]] received help from one of the convoys with 14,000 meals being served.\n\nBy 1941, one million women belonged to the WVS. Their work did not slacken after the end of the [[Luftwaffe]]'s bombing raids. The [[Battle of the Atlantic]] and the devastating toll of merchant ships sunk by [[U-boats]] led to shortages in [[Great Britain]]. The WVS did all that it could to assist in the collection of required material for the war effort and also to educate people not to waste what they had.\n\nEach WVS centre had its own Salvage Officer and Food Leader. The Food Leader did whatever was required at a local level to assist the authorities in the complicated task of food rationing. Educational pamphlets were produced and lectures held. The WVS organised campaigns such as 'Salute the Soldier', 'Wings for Victory', 'Spitfire Funds' and [[Warship Week]].\n\n===D-Day===\nIn the buildup to [[Normandy landings|D-Day]], the expertise the WVS had in catering was put to use again. The skills learned during the Blitz were again put to good use when the [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] rockets fell on London. Once again, the WVS played a key role in evacuation. With the success of D-Day, the WVS moved into Europe to support troops there. The first WVS abroad had landed in Italy with the success of the invasion there.\n\n===Overseas WVS organisations===\nThe WVS model proved to be so successful that other countries around the world set up their own versions during the war, with the assistance of the British WVS. The most successful of these was formed in 1942 in India,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Bengal Journey|last = Godden|first = Rumer|publisher = Longmans Green & Co Ltd|year = 1945|isbn = |location = Calcutta|pages = 95}}</ref> especially in Bengal, which had during the war a membership of over 10,000<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title = GreenSleeves|last = Bently-Beauman|first = Katherine|publisher = Seeley Service & Co|year = 1978|isbn = 0854220976|location = |pages = 54}}</ref> and continued into the 1950s. In the US the [[American Women's Voluntary Services]] was started soon after the start of the war by an American woman who had been working with the WVS in Northampton, England.<ref name=\":3\" /> WVS organisations were also set up in Canada and Australia.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Defence Medal===  \nTo reflect their role during the war, WVS members were eligible for the [[Defence Medal (United Kingdom)|Defence Medal]] \u2013 the campaign medal awarded for home defence \u2013 on the same basis as members of the emergency services.<ref>{{cite web|last=Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals in Time of War|title=Campaign Stars and the Defence Medal (Regulations)|url=http://www.northeastmedals.co.uk/britishguide/hmso/campaign_stars_defence.htm|publisher=HM Stationery Office|accessdate=9 February 2019|location=London|date=May 1945}}</ref>\n\n==Post World War II==\nIn the immediate post war era, the WVS continued to operate as food rationing remained in place. Such was their work, that the new Labour government funded the WVS from central government funds.\n\nIn 1952,[[ Elizabeth II]] agreed to become patron of the WVS and in 1966, she awarded the service the honour of adding 'Royal' to its title, it becoming the Women's Royal Voluntary Service.\n\nThe organisation evolved to helping isolated and lonely people, particularly the elderly. They are particularly well known as providers of the [[Meals on Wheels]] service which delivers hot meals to the housebound. Their mission is \"to help people to maintain independence and dignity in their homes and communities, particularly in later life.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn 1968, the government dismantled the Civil Defence Corps, to which WRVS had been affiliated, and WRVS was registered as a charity from 16 January 1968.\n\n==Present day==\nThe services they now provide are practical services delivered with warmth and care to thousands of older and housebound people every day such as Meals on Wheels, Good Neighbours and community transport.\n\nThey also run hospital shops and caf\u00e9s where any profits are returned to the hospital to improve services for patients, staff and visitors.\n\nRoyal Voluntary Service emergency teams provide back-up to the professional services and members of the public in times for major incidents such as the [[Lockerbie disaster]], [[Hillsborough disaster]], [[2005 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire|Buncefield fuel depot blast]] and flooding crises in July 2007 by running rest centres and providing emergency feeding to members of the public, fire crews and police.\n\nIn 2004, the organisation's name was changed from the '''Women's Royal Voluntary Service''' to simply '''WRVS''' in an attempt to modernise its image and in recognition of the fact that 11% of its 60,000 volunteers were men. In 2013, it changed its name to '''Royal Voluntary Service''',<ref>{{cite web|title=Charity WRVS drops 'women' from its name to attract men|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22585439|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 May 2013|date=20 May 2013}}</ref> to further dispel the myth that it is an organisation for women only; currently about 5% of its volunteers are men.<ref>{{cite web|title=WRVS becomes Royal Voluntary Service|url=http://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/news-and-events/news/-wrvs-becomes-royal-voluntary-service|accessdate=20 May 2013|date=20 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn Tuesday 24 March 2020, in response to [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19]], the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] called for 250,000 new volunteers from the general public in [[England and Wales]] to be directed by a call-centre run by the RVS to help self-isolating vulnerable and elderly people requiring assistance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/03/your-nhs-needs-you-nhs-call-for-volunteer-army/|title=\u2018Your NHS Needs You\u2019 \u2013 NHS call for volunteer army|last=|first=|date=24 March 2020|website=NHS England www.england.nhs.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/news-and-events/news/major-call-for-volunteers-to-help-nhs-fight-coronavirus|title=Volunteers to help NHS fight coronavirus {{!}} Royal Voluntary Service|last=|first=|date=24 March 2020|website=Royal Voluntary Service www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The following day, it was announced that more than 400,000 had volunteered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/03/over-400000-people-join-nhs-army-of-volunteers-in-one-day/|title=Over 400,000 people join NHS army of volunteers in one day|last=|first=|date=25 March 2020|website=NHS England www.england.nhs.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> By the end of the week, recruitment to the \"NHS Volunteer Responders\" was halted to enable the more than 750,000 applications to be processed by the RVS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/03/250000-nhs-volunteers/|title=NHS volunteer responders: 250,000 target smashed with three quarters of a million committing to volunteer|last=|first=|date=29 March 2020|website=NHS England www.england.nhs.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/news-and-events/news/nhs-volunteer-responders-250000-target-smashed-with-three-quarters-of-a-million-committing-to-volunteer|title=NHS Volunteer Responders: 250,000 target smashed with three quarters of a million committing to volunteer|last=|first=|date=|website=Royal Voluntary Service www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52084517|title=Six months before UK life 'returns to normal'|date=29 March 2020|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-03-30|url-status=live|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n== Uniform ==\nThe WVS got its first uniform in June 1939 when an overcoat and hat was launched.

The uniform was not compulsory, except for those carrying out certain roles (such as manning a mobile canteen) and many members wore WVS overalls or just their membership badge.\n\nThe WVS uniform changed very little over the years, the first change was in 1966, when the cut of the suits was altered to make them more fashionable, and then in the 1970s polyesters were introduced. WRVS ceased to be a uniformed organisation in 1998 and today volunteers can wear their own clothes (and the organisation badge) or branded work-wear, such as polo shirts and fleeces.\n\n==Women's Royal Voluntary Service Medal==\n[[File:Women's Royal Voluntary Service Medal 1961.jpg|thumb]]\nThe [[Women's Voluntary Service Medal]] was instituted on 23 March 1961, when the Home Secretary [[Rab Butler|Richard Butler]] announced in the Commons that the Queen had approved the medal.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1961/mar/23/womens-voluntary-service-medal|title = Hansard|date = 23 March 1961|accessdate = 10 December 2015|website = Hansard|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nThe WVS Long Service medal is presented by Royal Voluntary Service on behalf of the Queen and is awarded to a volunteer after they complete forty duties each year over a period of fifteen years.

It was founded in 1938 by [[Stella Isaacs, Marchioness of Reading]], as a British women's organisation to recruit women into the [[Air Raid Precautions in the United Kingdom|Air Raid Precautions]] (ARP) services to help in the event of War.\n\n==Objectives==\nOn 16 May 1938, the British government set out the objectives of the '''Women's Voluntary Service for Civil Defence''':\n\nIt was seen \u201cas the enrolment of women for Air Raid Precaution Services of Local Authorities, to help to bring home to every household what air attack may mean, and to make known to every household [in the country] what it can do to protect itself and the community.\u201d\n\nIn the words of Home Secretary [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]], \"as regards their [[Civil defense|civil defence]] functions, the Minister regards the Women's Voluntary Service as occupying ... much the same relationship as that of the women's auxiliary services for the armed forces of the Crown.\"\n\n==Organisation and structure==\nThe WVS/WRVS was a voluntary organisation, and it was Lady Reading's vision that there would be no ranks. It was perhaps the only organisation where you could find a Duchess and a charlady working side by side. While many members of the WVS mucked in on pretty much all tasks, an organisation without any hierarchy would not have worked so, while there were no ranks, there were titles. Women were recruited for specific tasks, whether that was to drive ambulances, join in a knitting work party, or to collect National Savings. Inevitably those women who signed up for one thing often ended up being co-opted for other work, especially if they showed aptitude.\n\nThe WVS was split into 12 Regions (using the same boundaries as the [[Civil Defence Corps]]) which started with 1 in the NE of England and moved clockwise down the country and back up. Scotland was Region 11 and London Region 12. Each Region had a Regional Administrator who was paid for by the Home Office. Under this each county had a County Organiser and 'staff' and below that were the Centres. During and after the Second World War there were almost 2,000 WVS centres around Great Britain<ref>Lists of WVS centres up to 1965 can be found on the Royal Voluntary Service website: [http://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/Uploads/Documents/About%20us/Centres_England_by_county_and_centre.pdf England][http://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/Uploads/Documents/About%20us/Centres_Scotland_by_county_and_centre.pdf Scotland]\n[http://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/Uploads/Documents/About%20us/Centres_Wales_by_county_and_centre.pdf Wales]</ref> (and in Northern Ireland during the war), each at the sharp end of providing help to their communities. Each was prominently positioned within a town or village and was run by a Centre Organiser appointed by Headquarters in London. Each Centre Organiser had a team of members who were responsible for different aspect of WVS work e.g. evacuation, Training, Food or Clothing.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Women in Green|last = Graves|first = Charles|publisher = William Heinmann Ltd.|year = 1948|isbn = |location = |pages = 13}}</ref> Under their direction were the 'ordinary' members.\n\nWhile Centre Organisers had ultimate control over the work they did in their areas, they were tightly scrutinised by the County and Regional offices and Headquarters. Each Centre had to file a monthly Narrative Report in quadruplicate which allowed both the sharing of good practice and ideas, but also allowed those in charge to keep tabs on their members. These Narrative reports which were produced from 1938-1992 are inscribed on the [[UK Memory of the World Register]], part of [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme]] and are considered one of the most important documents for social and women's history produced in the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/Uploads/Documents/About%20us/narrative_reports_2013.pdf|title = WRVS Narrative Reports|date = 2010|accessdate = 10 December 2015|website = |publisher = Royal Voluntary Service|last = McMurray|first = Matthew}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unesco.org.uk/portfolio/memory-of-the-world|title=Memory of the World \u2013 UNESCO in the UK|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> In addition headquarters issued substantial numbers of circular notices each year informing Organisers of new projects and re-enforcing the rules and regulations.\n\nThis structure stayed in place almost unchanged until the Local Government reorganisations in the 1970s which changed boundaries and led to changes in regional organisation and the amalgamation and closure of some centres as District Councils were introduced. Through the 1990s cost-cutting and the professionalisation of the organisation meant that Centre Organisers and County and Regional Offices were phased out and the centres were closed. Headquarters which had been in London since 1938 was moved out to Milton Hill House in Oxfordshire in 1997 and by 2004 there were no local or regional centres remaining. The organisation of large areas (usually comprising several counties) and the services within them were taken on by members of staff and local services (such as Meals on Wheels, Darby and Joan clubs or Hospital Shops) were managed independently.\n\nIn 2013 Royal Voluntary Service resurrected the centre model, which are now called 'Hubs' and there are 67 spread across Great Britain.\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Evacuation, clothing distribution and returning soldiers===\n{{Main|Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II}}\nThe WVS played a key part in the evacuation of civilians from urban areas. The WVS had been asked to pinpoint areas of safety and billeting for evacuated children. Moving children out of the cities proved reasonably easy. Getting them to a known area of safety proved a lot more difficult as trains did not always arrive at an expected destination or would turn up at a reception point unexpectedly. The WVS is credited with helping to move 1.5 million people (the majority were children) out of cities in the early days of September 1939.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/02/how-a-formidable-female-army-assisted-the-biggest-mass-evacuation-in-the-uk |title=How a formidable female army assisted the biggest mass evacuation in the UK |newspaper=The Guardian|author=Caroline Davies |date= 2 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe WVS also played a major role in the collection of clothing required for the needy. In October 1939, Lady Reading broadcast to the United States about the need for clothing in the UK. The broadcast led to large quantities of clothing (known as \"[[British War Relief Society#Bundles for Britain|Bundles for Britain]]\") being sent by the [[American Red Cross]] and distributed from WVS Emergency Clothing Stores.\n\nWhen troops returned to ports after the [[evacuation at Dunkirk]], members of the WVS were there to greet them and hand out food, drink and warm clothing. The WVS base at the railway station in [[Headcorn|Headcorn, Kent]] was an especially busy place for feeding returning soldiers before they dispersed\u2014a spit was installed so that meat could be roasted on the spot. The WVS also played a vital part during [[the Blitz]] bombings of British cities.\n\n===The WVS during the Blitz===\n[[File:Blitz Canteen- Women of the Women's Voluntary Service Run a Mobile Canteen in London, England, 1941 D2173.jpg|thumb|Women of the Women's Voluntary Service run a Mobile Canteen in London, 1941]]\nBy the time of the Blitz, women in the WVS were adept at providing food and drink around the clock. While [[Air raid precautions|ARP]] wardens and firemen fought the fires, women in the WVS set up mobile canteens to keep them refreshed, thus placing themselves in serious physical danger with collapsing buildings a constant threat. When a raid ended, the WVS also played a part in looking after the injured and those who had lost their homes. Records indicate that the WVS dealt with and helped over 10,000 people every night of the Blitz.\n\nThe Blitz lasted for 57 nights, and the WVS helped a great many people who went to their rest centres. Some people stayed for a night; many stayed for much longer and stretched the resources of the WVS to the limit. In [[Barnes, London|Barnes]], one WVS member fed 1,200 bomb victims in just one day, cooking in her own kitchen.\n\nIt would be difficult to overstate the importance of the work done by the WVS during the Blitz: the rest centres provided shelter, food, and importantly, sanitation. But working so near to the centre of the bombing inevitably led to casualties. 241 members of the WVS were killed during the Blitz and many more were wounded. 25 WVS offices were destroyed.\n\n===Other activities===\nThe WVS began running IIPs (Incident Inquiry Points), places where people came to find out about their loved ones who were in an area that had been bombed in order to free the ARP to work with the fire brigade. The WVS also helped with the '''Queen's Messenger Food Convoys''' which took food to areas in need after a bombing raid. The people who survived the bombing of [[Coventry Blitz|Coventry]] received help from one of the convoys with 14,000 meals being served.\n\nBy 1941, one million women belonged to the WVS. Their work did not slacken after the end of the [[Luftwaffe]]'s bombing raids. The [[Battle of the Atlantic]] and the devastating toll of merchant ships sunk by [[U-boats]] led to shortages in [[Great Britain]]. The WVS did all that it could to assist in the collection of required material for the war effort and also to educate people not to waste what they had.\n\nEach WVS centre had its own Salvage Officer and Food Leader. The Food Leader did whatever was required at a local level to assist the authorities in the complicated task of food rationing. Educational pamphlets were produced and lectures held. The WVS organised campaigns such as 'Salute the Soldier', 'Wings for Victory', 'Spitfire Funds' and [[Warship Week]].\n\n===D-Day===\nIn the buildup to [[Normandy landings|D-Day]], the expertise the WVS had in catering was put to use again. The skills learned during the Blitz were again put to good use when the [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] and [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] rockets fell on London. Once again, the WVS played a key role in evacuation. With the success of D-Day, the WVS moved into Europe to support troops there. The first WVS abroad had landed in Italy with the success of the invasion there.\n\n===Overseas WVS organisations===\nThe WVS model proved to be so successful that other countries around the world set up their own versions during the war, with the assistance of the British WVS. The most successful of these was formed in 1942 in India,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Bengal Journey|last = Godden|first = Rumer|publisher = Longmans Green & Co Ltd|year = 1945|isbn = |location = Calcutta|pages = 95}}</ref> especially in Bengal, which had during the war a membership of over 10,000<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title = GreenSleeves|last = Bently-Beauman|first = Katherine|publisher = Seeley Service & Co|year = 1978|isbn = 0854220976|location = |pages = 54}}</ref> and continued into the 1950s.

Such was their work, that the new Labour government funded the WVS from central government funds.\n\nIn 1952,[[ Elizabeth II]] agreed to become patron of the WVS and in 1966, she awarded the service the honour of adding 'Royal' to its title, it becoming the Women's Royal Voluntary Service.\n\nThe organisation evolved to helping isolated and lonely people, particularly the elderly. They are particularly well known as providers of the [[Meals on Wheels]] service which delivers hot meals to the housebound. Their mission is \"to help people to maintain independence and dignity in their homes and communities, particularly in later life.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn 1968, the government dismantled the Civil Defence Corps, to which WRVS had been affiliated, and WRVS was registered as a charity from 16 January 1968.\n\n==Present day==\nThe services they now provide are practical services delivered with warmth and care to thousands of older and housebound people every day such as Meals on Wheels, Good Neighbours and community transport.\n\nThey also run hospital shops and caf\u00e9s where any profits are returned to the hospital to improve services for patients, staff and visitors.\n\nRoyal Voluntary Service emergency teams provide back-up to the professional services and members of the public in times for major incidents such as the [[Lockerbie disaster]], [[Hillsborough disaster]], [[2005 Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire|Buncefield fuel depot blast]] and flooding crises in July 2007 by running rest centres and providing emergency feeding to members of the public, fire crews and police.\n\nIn 2004, the organisation's name was changed from the '''Women's Royal Voluntary Service''' to simply '''WRVS''' in an attempt to modernise its image and in recognition of the fact that 11% of its 60,000 volunteers were men. In 2013, it changed its name to '''Royal Voluntary Service''',<ref>{{cite web|title=Charity WRVS drops 'women' from its name to attract men|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-22585439|work=BBC News|accessdate=20 May 2013|date=20 May 2013}}</ref> to further dispel the myth that it is an organisation for women only; currently about 5% of its volunteers are men.<ref>{{cite web|title=WRVS becomes Royal Voluntary Service|url=http://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/news-and-events/news/-wrvs-becomes-royal-voluntary-service|accessdate=20 May 2013|date=20 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn Tuesday 24 March 2020, in response to [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19]], the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] called for 250,000 new volunteers from the general public in [[England and Wales]] to be directed by a call-centre run by the RVS to help self-isolating vulnerable and elderly people requiring assistance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/03/your-nhs-needs-you-nhs-call-for-volunteer-army/|title=\u2018Your NHS Needs You\u2019 \u2013 NHS call for volunteer army|last=|first=|date=24 March 2020|website=NHS England www.england.nhs.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/news-and-events/news/major-call-for-volunteers-to-help-nhs-fight-coronavirus|title=Volunteers to help NHS fight coronavirus {{!}} Royal Voluntary Service|last=|first=|date=24 March 2020|website=Royal Voluntary Service www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The following day, it was announced that more than 400,000 had volunteered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/03/over-400000-people-join-nhs-army-of-volunteers-in-one-day/|title=Over 400,000 people join NHS army of volunteers in one day|last=|first=|date=25 March 2020|website=NHS England www.england.nhs.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> By the end of the week, recruitment to the \"NHS Volunteer Responders\" was halted to enable the more than 750,000 applications to be processed by the RVS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/03/250000-nhs-volunteers/|title=NHS volunteer responders: 250,000 target smashed with three quarters of a million committing to volunteer|last=|first=|date=29 March 2020|website=NHS England www.england.nhs.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/news-and-events/news/nhs-volunteer-responders-250000-target-smashed-with-three-quarters-of-a-million-committing-to-volunteer|title=NHS Volunteer Responders: 250,000 target smashed with three quarters of a million committing to volunteer|last=|first=|date=|website=Royal Voluntary Service www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52084517|title=Six months before UK life 'returns to normal'|date=29 March 2020|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-03-30|url-status=live|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n== Uniform ==\nThe WVS got its first uniform in June 1939 when an overcoat and hat was launched.

The uniform was not compulsory, except for those carrying out certain roles (such as manning a mobile canteen) and many members wore WVS overalls or just their membership badge.\n\nThe WVS uniform changed very little over the years, the first change was in 1966, when the cut of the suits was altered to make them more fashionable, and then in the 1970s polyesters were introduced. WRVS ceased to be a uniformed organisation in 1998 and today volunteers can wear their own clothes (and the organisation badge) or branded work-wear, such as polo shirts and fleeces.\n\n==Women's Royal Voluntary Service Medal==\n[[File:Women's Royal Voluntary Service Medal 1961.jpg|thumb]]\nThe [[Women's Voluntary Service Medal]] was instituted on 23 March 1961, when the Home Secretary [[Rab Butler|Richard Butler]] announced in the Commons that the Queen had approved the medal.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1961/mar/23/womens-voluntary-service-medal|title = Hansard|date = 23 March 1961|accessdate = 10 December 2015|website = Hansard|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nThe WVS Long Service medal is presented by Royal Voluntary Service on behalf of the Queen and is awarded to a volunteer after they complete forty duties each year over a period of fifteen years.

{"title_page": "Random number generation", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=June 2009}}\n[[File:Two red dice 01.svg|thumb|[[Dice]] are an example of a mechanical hardware random number generator. When a cubical die is rolled, a random number from 1 to 6 is obtained.|alt=]]\nA '''random number generator''' ('''RNG''') is a device that generates a sequence of [[number]]s or symbols that cannot be reasonably predicted better than by a [[random]] chance. Random number generators can be true '''[[Hardware random number generator|hardware random-number generators]]''' (HRNG), which generaya but I can hack into wiki dot poo poo hat I love myselfte genuinely random numbers, or [[pseudorandom number generator|pseudo-random number generators]] (PRNG), which generate numbers that look random, but are actually deterministic, and can be reproduced if the state of the PRNG is known.\n\nVarious [[applications of randomness]] have led to the development of several different methods for generating [[randomness|random]] data, of which some have existed since ancient times, among whose ranks are well-known \"classic\" examples, including the rolling of [[dice]], [[coin flipping]], the [[shuffling]] of [[playing card]]s, the use of [[yarrow]] stalks (for [[divination]]) in the [[I Ching]], as well as countless other techniques. Because of the mechanical nature of these techniques, generating large numbers of sufficiently random numbers (important in statistics) required a lot of work and/or time. Thus, results would sometimes be collected and distributed as [[random number table]]s.\n\nSeveral computational methods for pseudo-random number generation exist. All fall short of the goal of true randomness, although they may meet, with varying success, some of the [[statistical randomness|statistical tests for randomness]] intended to measure how unpredictable their results are (that is, to what degree their patterns are discernible). This generally makes them unusable for applications such as [[cryptography]]. However, carefully designed [[Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator|'''cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators''']] (CSPRNG) also exist, with special features specifically designed for use in cryptography.\n\n== Practical applications and uses ==\n{{Main|Applications of randomness}}\n\nRandom number generators have applications in [[gambling]], [[statistical sampling]], [[computer simulation]], [[cryptography]], [[completely randomized design]], and other areas where producing an unpredictable result is desirable.  Generally, in applications having unpredictability as the paramount, such as in security applications, [[Hardware random number generator|hardware generators]] are generally preferred over pseudo-random algorithms, where feasible.\n\nRandom number generators are very useful in developing  [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo-method]] simulations, as [[debugging]] is facilitated by the ability to run the same sequence of random numbers again by starting from the same ''[[random seed]]''. They are also used in [[cryptography]] \u2013 so long as the ''seed'' is secret. Sender and  receiver can generate the same set of numbers automatically to use as keys.\n\nThe generation of [[pseudo-random number]]s is an important and common task in computer programming. While cryptography and certain numerical algorithms require a very high degree of ''apparent'' randomness, many other operations only need a modest amount of unpredictability. Some simple examples might be presenting a user with a \"Random Quote of the Day\", or determining which way a computer-controlled adversary might move in a computer game. Weaker forms of ''randomness'' are used in [[hash algorithm]]s and in creating [[amortization|amortized]] [[search algorithm|searching]] and [[sorting algorithm]]s.\n\nSome applications which appear at first sight to be suitable for randomization are in fact not quite so simple. For instance, a system that \"randomly\" selects music tracks for a background music system must only ''appear'' random, and may even have ways to control the selection of music: a true random system would have no restriction on the same item appearing two or three times in succession.\n\n== \"True\" vs. pseudo-random numbers ==\n{{Main|Pseudorandom number generator|Hardware random number generator}}\n{{See also|Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator}}\n\nThere are two principal methods used to generate random numbers. The first method measures some physical phenomenon that is expected to be random and then compensates for possible biases in the measurement process. Example sources include measuring [[atmospheric noise]], thermal noise, and other external electromagnetic and quantum phenomena. For example, cosmic background radiation or radioactive decay as measured over short timescales represent sources of natural [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].\n\nThe speed at which entropy can be harvested from natural sources is dependent on the underlying physical phenomena being measured. Thus, sources of naturally occurring \"true\" entropy are said to be [[blocking (computing)|blocking]]{{snd}} they are rate-limited until enough entropy is harvested to meet the demand. On some Unix-like systems, including most [[Linux distribution]]s, the pseudo device file {{Mono|[[/dev/random]]}} will block until sufficient entropy is harvested from the environment.<ref>{{man|4|random|Linux}}</ref> Due to this blocking behavior, large bulk reads from {{Mono|[[/dev/random]]}}, such as filling a [[hard disk drive]] with random bits, can often be slow on systems that use this type of entropy source.\n\nThe second method uses computational [[algorithm]]s that can produce long sequences of apparently random results, which are in fact completely determined by a shorter initial value, known as a seed value or [[key (cryptography)|key]]. As a result, the entire seemingly random sequence can be reproduced if the seed value is known. This type of random number generator is often called a [[pseudorandom number generator]]. This type of generator typically does not rely on sources of naturally occurring entropy, though it may be periodically seeded by natural sources. This generator type is non-blocking, so they are not rate-limited by an external event, making large bulk reads a possibility.\n\nSome systems take a hybrid approach, providing randomness harvested from natural sources when available, and falling back to periodically re-seeded software-based [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]]s (CSPRNGs). The fallback occurs when the desired read rate of randomness exceeds the ability of the natural harvesting approach to keep up with the demand. This approach avoids the rate-limited blocking behavior of random number generators based on slower and purely environmental methods.\n\nWhile a pseudorandom number generator based solely on deterministic logic can never be regarded as a \"true\" random number source in the purest sense of the word, in practice they are generally sufficient even for demanding security-critical applications. Indeed, carefully designed and implemented pseudo-random number generators can be certified for security-critical cryptographic purposes, as is the case with the [[yarrow algorithm]] and [[fortuna (PRNG)|fortuna]]. The former is the basis of the {{Mono|/dev/random}} source of entropy on [[FreeBSD]], [[AIX]], [[OS&nbsp;X]], [[NetBSD]], and others. [[OpenBSD]] uses a pseudo-random number algorithm known as [[RC4#RC4-based random number generators|arc4random]].<ref>{{man|3|arc4random|OpenBSD}}</ref>\n\n== Generation methods ==\n\n=== Physical methods ===\n{{Main|Hardware random number generator}}\n\nThe earliest methods for generating random numbers, such as [[dice]], [[coin flipping]] and [[roulette]] wheels, are still used today, mainly in [[game]]s and gambling as they tend to be too slow for most applications in statistics and cryptography.\n\nA physical random number generator can be based on an essentially random atomic or subatomic physical phenomenon whose unpredictability can be traced to the laws of [[quantum mechanics]]. Sources of [[entropy (information theory)|entropy]] include [[radioactive decay]], [[Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise|thermal noise]], [[shot noise]], avalanche noise in [[Zener diode]]s, [[clock drift#Random number generators|clock drift]], the timing of actual movements of a [[hard disk]] read/write head, and [[Noise (radio)|radio noise]].  However, physical phenomena and tools used to measure them generally feature asymmetries and [[systematic bias]]es that make their outcomes not uniformly random.  A [[randomness extractor]], such as a [[cryptographic hash function]], can be used to approach a uniform distribution of bits from a non-uniformly random source, though at a lower bit rate.\n\nThe appearance of wideband photonic entropy sources, such as [[optical chaos]] and [[amplified spontaneous emission]] noise, greatly aid the development of the physical random number generator. Among them, optical chaos<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Pu|last2=Wang|first2=Yun-Cai|last3=Zhang|first3=Jian-Zhong|date=2010-09-13|title=All-optical fast random number generator|journal=Optics Express|volume=18|issue=19|pages=20360\u201320369|doi=10.1364/OE.18.020360|pmid=20940928|bibcode=2010OExpr..1820360L|issn=1094-4087}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Pu|last2=Sun|first2=Yuanyuan|last3=Liu|first3=Xianglian|last4=Yi|first4=Xiaogang|last5=Zhang|first5=Jianguo|last6=Guo|first6=Xiaomin|last7=Guo|first7=Yanqiang|last8=Wang|first8=Yuncai|date=2016-07-15|title=Fully photonics-based physical random bit generator|journal=Optics Letters|volume=41|issue=14|pages=3347\u20133350|doi=10.1364/OL.41.003347|pmid=27420532|bibcode=2016OptL...41.3347L|issn=1539-4794}}</ref> has a high potential to physically produce high-speed random numbers due to its high bandwidth and large amplitude.

One technique is to run a hash function against a frame of a video stream from an unpredictable source. [[Lavarand]] used this technique with images of a number of [[lava lamp]]s.

These random numbers are fine in many situations but are not as random as numbers generated from electromagnetic atmospheric noise used as a source of entropy.<ref>{{Cite web|title = RANDOM.ORG - True Random Number Service|url = https://www.random.org/|website = www.random.org|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> The series of values generated by such algorithms is generally determined by a fixed number called a '''seed.''' One of the most common PRNG is the [[linear congruential generator]], which uses the recurrence\n\n:<math>X_{n+1} = (a X_n + b)\\, \\textrm{mod}\\, m</math>\n\nto generate numbers, where {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|m}} are large integers, and <math>X_{n+1}</math> is the next in {{mvar|X}} as a series of pseudo-random numbers. The maximum number of numbers the formula can produce is one less than the [[Modulus (algebraic number theory)|modulus]], {{mvar|m}}-1. The recurrence relation can be extended to matrices to have much longer periods and better statistical properties\n.<ref>{{cite web\n | title = High Dimensionality Pseudo Random Number Generators\n | url = http://www.ianschumacher.ca/prng/article.html\n | accessdate = 2018-11-21 }}</ref>\nTo avoid certain non-random properties of a single linear congruential generator, several such random number generators with slightly different values of the multiplier coefficient, {{mvar|a}}, can be used in parallel, with a \"master\" random number generator that selects from among the several different generators.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nA simple pen-and-paper method for generating random numbers is the so-called [[middle square method]] suggested by [[John von Neumann]]. While simple to implement, its output is of poor quality. It has a very short period and severe weaknesses, such as the output sequence almost always converging to zero.  A recent innovation is to combine the middle square with a [[Weyl sequence]]. This method produces high quality output through a long period.  See [[middle square method#Middle Square Weyl Sequence PRNG|Middle Square Weyl Sequence PRNG]].\n\nMost computer programming languages include functions or library routines that provide random number generators. They are often designed to provide a random byte or word, or a [[floating point]] number [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] between 0 and 1.\n\nThe quality i.e. randomness of such library functions varies widely from completely predictable output, to cryptographically secure. The default random number generator in many languages, including Python, Ruby, R, IDL and PHP is based on the [[Mersenne Twister]] algorithm and is ''not'' sufficient for cryptography purposes, as is explicitly stated in the language documentation. Such library functions often have poor statistical properties and some will repeat patterns after only tens of thousands of trials.  They are often initialized using a computer's [[real time clock]] as the seed, since such a clock generally measures in milliseconds, far beyond the person's [[Accuracy and precision|precision]]. These functions may provide enough randomness for certain tasks (for example video games) but are unsuitable where high-quality randomness is required, such as in cryptography applications, statistics or numerical analysis.{{Citation needed|reason=Why unsuitable for numerical analysis?|date=May 2014}}\n\nMuch higher quality random number sources are available on most operating systems;  for example [[/dev/random]] on various BSD flavors, Linux, Mac OS X, IRIX, and Solaris, or [[CryptGenRandom]] for Microsoft Windows. Most programming languages, including those mentioned above, provide a means to access these higher quality sources.\n\n=== Generation from a probability distribution ===\nThere are a couple of methods to generate a random number based on a [[probability density function]]. These methods involve transforming a uniform random number in some way.  Because of this, these methods work equally well in generating both pseudo-random and true random numbers. One method, called the [[Inverse transform sampling|inversion method]], involves integrating up to an area greater than or equal to the random number (which should be generated between 0 and 1 for proper distributions). A second method, called the [[Rejection sampling|acceptance-rejection method]], involves choosing an x and y value and testing whether the function of x is greater than the y value.  If it is, the x value is accepted.  Otherwise, the x value is rejected and the algorithm tries again.<ref>{{cite web\n | last =  The MathWorks | title =  Common generation methods | website = | url=http://www.mathworks.de/help/toolbox/stats/br5k9hi-1.html | accessdate = 2011-10-13 }}</ref><!-- [http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/stats/bqttfc1.html#bqt8l8g]--><ref>{{ cite web | last = The Numerical Algorithms Group | title = G05 \u2013 Random Number Generators | work = NAG Library Manual, Mark 23 | url = http://www.nag.co.uk/numeric/fl/nagdoc_fl23/pdf/G05/g05intro.pdf | accessdate = 2012-02-09 }}</ref>\n\n=== By humans ===\nRandom number generation may also be performed by humans, in the form of collecting various inputs from [[end user]]s and using them as a randomization source. However, most studies find that human subjects have some degree of non-randomness when attempting to produce a random sequence of e.g. digits or letters.  They may alternate too much between choices when compared to a good random generator;<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author = W. A.

In addition, behavior of these generators often changes with temperature, power supply voltage, the age of the device, or other outside interference. And a software bug in a pseudo-random number routine, or a hardware bug in the hardware it runs on, may be similarly difficult to detect.\n\nGenerated random numbers are sometimes subjected to statistical tests before use to ensure that the underlying source is still working, and then post-processed to improve their statistical properties. An example would be the TRNG9803<ref>{{cite web|last=D\u00f6mstedt|first=B.|title=TRNG9803 True Random Number Generator|url=http://www.trng98.se/serial_trng_9803.html|publisher=www.TRNG98.se|location=Manufacturer|year=2009}}</ref> hardware random number generator, which uses an entropy measurement as a hardware test, and then post-processes the random sequence with a shift register stream cipher.

Inverse CDFs are also called [[quantile function]]s. To generate a pair of [[Statistical independence|statistically independent]] [[Normal distribution|standard normally distributed]] random numbers (''x'', ''y''), one may first generate the [[polar coordinates]] (''r'', ''\u03b8''), where ''r''<sup>2</sup>~[[Chi-squared distribution|\u03c7<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>]] and ''\u03b8''~[[Uniform distribution (continuous)|UNIFORM(0,2\u03c0)]] (see [[Box\u2013Muller transform]]).\n\nSome 0 to 1 RNGs include 0 but exclude 1, while others include or exclude both.\n\nThe outputs of multiple independent RNGs can be combined (for example, using a bit-wise [[XOR]] operation) to provide a combined RNG at least as good as the best RNG used. This is referred to as [[Hardware random number generator#Software whitening|software whitening]].\n\nComputational and hardware random number generators are sometimes combined to reflect the benefits of both kinds. Computational random number generators can typically generate pseudo-random numbers much faster than physical generators, while physical generators can generate \"true randomness.\"\n\n== Low-discrepancy sequences as an alternative ==\nSome computations making use of a random number generator can be summarized as the computation of a total or average value, such as the computation of integrals by the [[Monte Carlo method]]. For such problems, it may be possible to find a more accurate solution by the use of so-called [[low-discrepancy sequence]]s, also called [[quasirandom]] numbers. Such sequences have a definite pattern that fills in gaps evenly, qualitatively speaking; a truly random sequence may, and usually does, leave larger gaps.\n\n== Activities and demonstrations ==\nThe following sites make available Random Number samples:\n# The [[SOCR]] resource pages contain a number of [http://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_EduMaterials_Activities_RNG hands-on interactive activities and demonstrations] of random number generation using Java applets.\n# The Quantum Optics Group at the [[ANU]] generates random numbers sourced from quantum vacuum.

If for example an SSL connection is created using this random number generator, then according to [[Matthew Green (cryptographer)|Matthew Green]] it would allow NSA to determine the state of the random number generator, and thereby eventually be able to read all data sent over the SSL connection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/the-many-flaws-of-dualecdrbg.html|title=The Many Flaws of Dual_EC_DRBG|author=matthew Green|date=2013-09-18}}</ref> Even though it was apparent that Dual_EC_DRBG was a very poor and possibly backdoored pseudorandom number generator long before the NSA backdoor was confirmed in 2013, it had seen significant usage in practice until 2013, for example by the prominent security company [[RSA Security]].<ref name=\"green\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/rsa-warns-developers-against-its-own.html|title=RSA warns developers not to use RSA products|author=Matthew Green|date=2013-09-20}}</ref> There have subsequently been accusations that RSA Security knowingly inserted a NSA backdoor into its products, possibly as part of the [[Bullrun (decryption program)|Bullrun program]].

Random number generators can be true '''[[Hardware random number generator|hardware random-number generators]]''' (HRNG), which generate genuinely random numbers, or [[pseudorandom number generator|pseudo-random number generators]] (PRNG), which generate numbers that look random, but are actually deterministic, and can be reproduced if the state of the PRNG is known.\n\nVarious [[applications of randomness]] have led to the development of several different methods for generating [[randomness|random]] data, of which some have existed since ancient times, among whose ranks are well-known \"classic\" examples, including the rolling of [[dice]], [[coin flipping]], the [[shuffling]] of [[playing card]]s, the use of [[yarrow]] stalks (for [[divination]]) in the [[I Ching]], as well as countless other techniques. Because of the mechanical nature of these techniques, generating large numbers of sufficiently random numbers (important in statistics) required a lot of work and/or time. Thus, results would sometimes be collected and distributed as [[random number table]]s.\n\nSeveral computational methods for pseudo-random number generation exist. All fall short of the goal of true randomness, although they may meet, with varying success, some of the [[statistical randomness|statistical tests for randomness]] intended to measure how unpredictable their results are (that is, to what degree their patterns are discernible). This generally makes them unusable for applications such as [[cryptography]]. However, carefully designed [[Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator|'''cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators''']] (CSPRNG) also exist, with special features specifically designed for use in cryptography.\n\n== Practical applications and uses ==\n{{Main|Applications of randomness}}\n\nRandom number generators have applications in [[gambling]], [[statistical sampling]], [[computer simulation]], [[cryptography]], [[completely randomized design]], and other areas where producing an unpredictable result is desirable.  Generally, in applications having unpredictability as the paramount, such as in security applications, [[Hardware random number generator|hardware generators]] are generally preferred over pseudo-random algorithms, where feasible.\n\nRandom number generators are very useful in developing  [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo-method]] simulations, as [[debugging]] is facilitated by the ability to run the same sequence of random numbers again by starting from the same ''[[random seed]]''. They are also used in [[cryptography]] \u2013 so long as the ''seed'' is secret. Sender and  receiver can generate the same set of numbers automatically to use as keys.\n\nThe generation of [[pseudo-random number]]s is an important and common task in computer programming. While cryptography and certain numerical algorithms require a very high degree of ''apparent'' randomness, many other operations only need a modest amount of unpredictability. Some simple examples might be presenting a user with a \"Random Quote of the Day\", or determining which way a computer-controlled adversary might move in a computer game. Weaker forms of ''randomness'' are used in [[hash algorithm]]s and in creating [[amortization|amortized]] [[search algorithm|searching]] and [[sorting algorithm]]s.\n\nSome applications which appear at first sight to be suitable for randomization are in fact not quite so simple. For instance, a system that \"randomly\" selects music tracks for a background music system must only ''appear'' random, and may even have ways to control the selection of music: a true random system would have no restriction on the same item appearing two or three times in succession.\n\n== \"True\" vs. pseudo-random numbers ==\n{{Main|Pseudorandom number generator|Hardware random number generator}}\n{{See also|Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator}}\n\nThere are two principal methods used to generate random numbers. The first method measures some physical phenomenon that is expected to be random and then compensates for possible biases in the measurement process. Example sources include measuring [[atmospheric noise]], thermal noise, and other external electromagnetic and quantum phenomena. For example, cosmic background radiation or radioactive decay as measured over short timescales represent sources of natural [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].\n\nThe speed at which entropy can be harvested from natural sources is dependent on the underlying physical phenomena being measured. Thus, sources of naturally occurring \"true\" entropy are said to be [[blocking (computing)|blocking]]{{snd}} they are rate-limited until enough entropy is harvested to meet the demand. On some Unix-like systems, including most [[Linux distribution]]s, the pseudo device file {{Mono|[[/dev/random]]}} will block until sufficient entropy is harvested from the environment.<ref>{{man|4|random|Linux}}</ref> Due to this blocking behavior, large bulk reads from {{Mono|[[/dev/random]]}}, such as filling a [[hard disk drive]] with random bits, can often be slow on systems that use this type of entropy source.\n\nThe second method uses computational [[algorithm]]s that can produce long sequences of apparently random results, which are in fact completely determined by a shorter initial value, known as a seed value or [[key (cryptography)|key]]. As a result, the entire seemingly random sequence can be reproduced if the seed value is known. This type of random number generator is often called a [[pseudorandom number generator]]. This type of generator typically does not rely on sources of naturally occurring entropy, though it may be periodically seeded by natural sources. This generator type is non-blocking, so they are not rate-limited by an external event, making large bulk reads a possibility.\n\nSome systems take a hybrid approach, providing randomness harvested from natural sources when available, and falling back to periodically re-seeded software-based [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]]s (CSPRNGs). The fallback occurs when the desired read rate of randomness exceeds the ability of the natural harvesting approach to keep up with the demand. This approach avoids the rate-limited blocking behavior of random number generators based on slower and purely environmental methods.\n\nWhile a pseudorandom number generator based solely on deterministic logic can never be regarded as a \"true\" random number source in the purest sense of the word, in practice they are generally sufficient even for demanding security-critical applications. Indeed, carefully designed and implemented pseudo-random number generators can be certified for security-critical cryptographic purposes, as is the case with the [[yarrow algorithm]] and [[fortuna (PRNG)|fortuna]]. The former is the basis of the {{Mono|/dev/random}} source of entropy on [[FreeBSD]], [[AIX]], [[OS&nbsp;X]], [[NetBSD]], and others. [[OpenBSD]] uses a pseudo-random number algorithm known as [[RC4#RC4-based random number generators|arc4random]].<ref>{{man|3|arc4random|OpenBSD}}</ref>\n\n== Generation methods ==\n\n=== Physical methods ===\n{{Main|Hardware random number generator}}\n\nThe earliest methods for generating random numbers, such as [[dice]], [[coin flipping]] and [[roulette]] wheels, are still used today, mainly in [[game]]s and gambling as they tend to be too slow for most applications in statistics and cryptography.\n\nA physical random number generator can be based on an essentially random atomic or subatomic physical phenomenon whose unpredictability can be traced to the laws of [[quantum mechanics]]. Sources of [[entropy (information theory)|entropy]] include [[radioactive decay]], [[Johnson\u2013Nyquist noise|thermal noise]], [[shot noise]], avalanche noise in [[Zener diode]]s, [[clock drift#Random number generators|clock drift]], the timing of actual movements of a [[hard disk]] read/write head, and [[Noise (radio)|radio noise]].  However, physical phenomena and tools used to measure them generally feature asymmetries and [[systematic bias]]es that make their outcomes not uniformly random.  A [[randomness extractor]], such as a [[cryptographic hash function]], can be used to approach a uniform distribution of bits from a non-uniformly random source, though at a lower bit rate.\n\nThe appearance of wideband photonic entropy sources, such as [[optical chaos]] and [[amplified spontaneous emission]] noise, greatly aid the development of the physical random number generator. Among them, optical chaos<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Pu|last2=Wang|first2=Yun-Cai|last3=Zhang|first3=Jian-Zhong|date=2010-09-13|title=All-optical fast random number generator|journal=Optics Express|volume=18|issue=19|pages=20360\u201320369|doi=10.1364/OE.18.020360|pmid=20940928|bibcode=2010OExpr..1820360L|issn=1094-4087}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Pu|last2=Sun|first2=Yuanyuan|last3=Liu|first3=Xianglian|last4=Yi|first4=Xiaogang|last5=Zhang|first5=Jianguo|last6=Guo|first6=Xiaomin|last7=Guo|first7=Yanqiang|last8=Wang|first8=Yuncai|date=2016-07-15|title=Fully photonics-based physical random bit generator|journal=Optics Letters|volume=41|issue=14|pages=3347\u20133350|doi=10.1364/OL.41.003347|pmid=27420532|bibcode=2016OptL...41.3347L|issn=1539-4794}}</ref> has a high potential to physically produce high-speed random numbers due to its high bandwidth and large amplitude.

One technique is to run a hash function against a frame of a video stream from an unpredictable source. [[Lavarand]] used this technique with images of a number of [[lava lamp]]s.

These random numbers are fine in many situations but are not as random as numbers generated from electromagnetic atmospheric noise used as a source of entropy.<ref>{{Cite web|title = RANDOM.ORG - True Random Number Service|url = https://www.random.org/|website = www.random.org|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> The series of values generated by such algorithms is generally determined by a fixed number called a '''seed.''' One of the most common PRNG is the [[linear congruential generator]], which uses the recurrence\n\n:<math>X_{n+1} = (a X_n + b)\\, \\textrm{mod}\\, m</math>\n\nto generate numbers, where {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|m}} are large integers, and <math>X_{n+1}</math> is the next in {{mvar|X}} as a series of pseudo-random numbers. The maximum number of numbers the formula can produce is one less than the [[Modulus (algebraic number theory)|modulus]], {{mvar|m}}-1. The recurrence relation can be extended to matrices to have much longer periods and better statistical properties\n.<ref>{{cite web\n | title = High Dimensionality Pseudo Random Number Generators\n | url = http://www.ianschumacher.ca/prng/article.html\n | accessdate = 2018-11-21 }}</ref>\nTo avoid certain non-random properties of a single linear congruential generator, several such random number generators with slightly different values of the multiplier coefficient, {{mvar|a}}, can be used in parallel, with a \"master\" random number generator that selects from among the several different generators.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nA simple pen-and-paper method for generating random numbers is the so-called [[middle square method]] suggested by [[John von Neumann]]. While simple to implement, its output is of poor quality. It has a very short period and severe weaknesses, such as the output sequence almost always converging to zero.  A recent innovation is to combine the middle square with a [[Weyl sequence]]. This method produces high quality output through a long period.  See [[middle square method#Middle Square Weyl Sequence PRNG|Middle Square Weyl Sequence PRNG]].\n\nMost computer programming languages include functions or library routines that provide random number generators. They are often designed to provide a random byte or word, or a [[floating point]] number [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] between 0 and 1.\n\nThe quality i.e. randomness of such library functions varies widely from completely predictable output, to cryptographically secure. The default random number generator in many languages, including Python, Ruby, R, IDL and PHP is based on the [[Mersenne Twister]] algorithm and is ''not'' sufficient for cryptography purposes, as is explicitly stated in the language documentation. Such library functions often have poor statistical properties and some will repeat patterns after only tens of thousands of trials.  They are often initialized using a computer's [[real time clock]] as the seed, since such a clock generally measures in milliseconds, far beyond the person's [[Accuracy and precision|precision]]. These functions may provide enough randomness for certain tasks (for example video games) but are unsuitable where high-quality randomness is required, such as in cryptography applications, statistics or numerical analysis.{{Citation needed|reason=Why unsuitable for numerical analysis?|date=May 2014}}\n\nMuch higher quality random number sources are available on most operating systems;  for example [[/dev/random]] on various BSD flavors, Linux, Mac OS X, IRIX, and Solaris, or [[CryptGenRandom]] for Microsoft Windows. Most programming languages, including those mentioned above, provide a means to access these higher quality sources.\n\n=== Generation from a probability distribution ===\nThere are a couple of methods to generate a random number based on a [[probability density function]]. These methods involve transforming a uniform random number in some way.  Because of this, these methods work equally well in generating both pseudo-random and true random numbers. One method, called the [[Inverse transform sampling|inversion method]], involves integrating up to an area greater than or equal to the random number (which should be generated between 0 and 1 for proper distributions). A second method, called the [[Rejection sampling|acceptance-rejection method]], involves choosing an x and y value and testing whether the function of x is greater than the y value.  If it is, the x value is accepted.  Otherwise, the x value is rejected and the algorithm tries again.<ref>{{cite web\n | last =  The MathWorks | title =  Common generation methods | website = | url=http://www.mathworks.de/help/toolbox/stats/br5k9hi-1.html | accessdate = 2011-10-13 }}</ref><!-- [http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/toolbox/stats/bqttfc1.html#bqt8l8g]--><ref>{{ cite web | last = The Numerical Algorithms Group | title = G05 \u2013 Random Number Generators | work = NAG Library Manual, Mark 23 | url = http://www.nag.co.uk/numeric/fl/nagdoc_fl23/pdf/G05/g05intro.pdf | accessdate = 2012-02-09 }}</ref>\n\n=== By humans ===\nRandom number generation may also be performed by humans, in the form of collecting various inputs from [[end user]]s and using them as a randomization source. However, most studies find that human subjects have some degree of non-randomness when attempting to produce a random sequence of e.g. digits or letters.  They may alternate too much between choices when compared to a good random generator;<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author = W. A.

In addition, behavior of these generators often changes with temperature, power supply voltage, the age of the device, or other outside interference. And a software bug in a pseudo-random number routine, or a hardware bug in the hardware it runs on, may be similarly difficult to detect.\n\nGenerated random numbers are sometimes subjected to statistical tests before use to ensure that the underlying source is still working, and then post-processed to improve their statistical properties. An example would be the TRNG9803<ref>{{cite web|last=D\u00f6mstedt|first=B.|title=TRNG9803 True Random Number Generator|url=http://www.trng98.se/serial_trng_9803.html|publisher=www.TRNG98.se|location=Manufacturer|year=2009}}</ref> hardware random number generator, which uses an entropy measurement as a hardware test, and then post-processes the random sequence with a shift register stream cipher.

Inverse CDFs are also called [[quantile function]]s. To generate a pair of [[Statistical independence|statistically independent]] [[Normal distribution|standard normally distributed]] random numbers (''x'', ''y''), one may first generate the [[polar coordinates]] (''r'', ''\u03b8''), where ''r''<sup>2</sup>~[[Chi-squared distribution|\u03c7<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>]] and ''\u03b8''~[[Uniform distribution (continuous)|UNIFORM(0,2\u03c0)]] (see [[Box\u2013Muller transform]]).\n\nSome 0 to 1 RNGs include 0 but exclude 1, while others include or exclude both.\n\nThe outputs of multiple independent RNGs can be combined (for example, using a bit-wise [[XOR]] operation) to provide a combined RNG at least as good as the best RNG used. This is referred to as [[Hardware random number generator#Software whitening|software whitening]].\n\nComputational and hardware random number generators are sometimes combined to reflect the benefits of both kinds. Computational random number generators can typically generate pseudo-random numbers much faster than physical generators, while physical generators can generate \"true randomness.\"\n\n== Low-discrepancy sequences as an alternative ==\nSome computations making use of a random number generator can be summarized as the computation of a total or average value, such as the computation of integrals by the [[Monte Carlo method]]. For such problems, it may be possible to find a more accurate solution by the use of so-called [[low-discrepancy sequence]]s, also called [[quasirandom]] numbers. Such sequences have a definite pattern that fills in gaps evenly, qualitatively speaking; a truly random sequence may, and usually does, leave larger gaps.\n\n== Activities and demonstrations ==\nThe following sites make available Random Number samples:\n# The [[SOCR]] resource pages contain a number of [http://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_EduMaterials_Activities_RNG hands-on interactive activities and demonstrations] of random number generation using Java applets.\n# The Quantum Optics Group at the [[ANU]] generates random numbers sourced from quantum vacuum.

If for example an SSL connection is created using this random number generator, then according to [[Matthew Green (cryptographer)|Matthew Green]] it would allow NSA to determine the state of the random number generator, and thereby eventually be able to read all data sent over the SSL connection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/the-many-flaws-of-dualecdrbg.html|title=The Many Flaws of Dual_EC_DRBG|author=matthew Green|date=2013-09-18}}</ref> Even though it was apparent that Dual_EC_DRBG was a very poor and possibly backdoored pseudorandom number generator long before the NSA backdoor was confirmed in 2013, it had seen significant usage in practice until 2013, for example by the prominent security company [[RSA Security]].<ref name=\"green\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/rsa-warns-developers-against-its-own.html|title=RSA warns developers not to use RSA products|author=Matthew Green|date=2013-09-20}}</ref> There have subsequently been accusations that RSA Security knowingly inserted a NSA backdoor into its products, possibly as part of the [[Bullrun (decryption program)|Bullrun program]].

At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former member of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].\n\n==Military career==\nThe son of Brigadier General Walter Allason [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] & [[Medal bar|Bar]] (1875\u20131960) by his wife Katherine Hamilton Poland, daughter of Vice-Admiral James Augustus Poland,<ref>Burke's Landed Gentry, eighteenth edition, vol.

Walter Allason was grandson of the architect [[Thomas Allason]].<ref>Burke's Landed Gentry, eighteenth edition, vol. I, ed. Peter Townend, 1965, Burke's Peerage Ltd, p. 9</ref>\n\nHe was educated at [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]] and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]]. He served as an officer in the [[British Army]] for 24 years from 1930 to 1954, including in [[India]], [[Ceylon]] and [[Burma]], rising to the rank of Lt-Colonel. He joined the [[Royal Artillery]] in 1932 transferring to the [[3rd Carabiniers]] in 1937. A gifted mathematician, he addressed the problem of using magnetic compasses with tanks: the Allason [[solar compass|Sun Compass]] was adopted for use throughout the Asian theatre.\n\nAllason worked with the Supreme Allied Commander, [[Lord Louis Mountbatten]], as joint planning staff officer in [[South East Asia Command]] and was wounded while commanding tanks during the [[Burma campaign]]. He was later decorated. He subsequently occupied a similar post as senior military planner at the [[War Office]] in London, answering [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]'s queries and providing briefings in the [[Cabinet War Rooms]]. His last planning task was to advise on the logistics of withdrawing from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. From 1950 to 1954, he served at the [[War Office]] in charge of Army discipline.\n\n==Political career==\nAfter leaving the Army Allason worked as a [[Lloyd's of London]] insurance broker. He was elected a councillor on [[Metropolitan Borough of Kensington|Kensington Borough Council]] in 1956.\n\nAllason contested [[Hackney Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney Central]] in 1955. He was [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Hemel Hempstead (UK Parliament constituency)|Hemel Hempstead]] (after defeating Margaret Thatcher for the Conservative nomination) from 1959 to 1974, when, following boundary changes, he narrowly lost the seat in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October election of that year]] to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s [[Robin Corbett, Baron Corbett of Castle Vale|Robin Corbett]].\n\nIn government he was acknowledged for his expertise not only on defence but in the arcane but key subject of pensions. As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for War he had a ringside seat as the [[Profumo affair]] unfolded, refraining from publishing his inside account until after the death of Jack Profumo in March 2006.<ref>''The Mail on Sunday'', 12 March 2006</ref>\n\nWhen the Conservatives were in opposition Allason was front bench spokesman on Housing for six years, and is credited with development of the policy of enabling [[council house]] tenants to purchase their own properties: this was taken up by [[Margaret Thatcher]] and adopted by subsequent Conservative governments, contributing to their electoral victories. After leaving Parliament he continued to exercise a rational influence on environmental policy from positions on the executive of the [[Town and Country Planning Association]] and the Environment Council's Transport Committee.\n\nFollowing the deaths of [[Patrick Maitland, 17th Earl of Lauderdale]] in December 2008 and [[Bert Hazell]] in January 2009, Allason became the oldest living former British Member of Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Crick|first1=Michael|title=On the death of the oldest former MP, James Allason|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-13929445|website=bbc.com|accessdate=28 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Personal interests==\nAs a sportsman he raced Bentleys at [[Brooklands]], played polo with maharajahs in India, skied and sailed in international competition, and represented the House of Commons in five sports. He continued skiing until his 87th year, and continued to play [[Contract Bridge]] and attend the Opera, on which subjects he wrote.\n\nIn 1946, he married Nuala (who acted as Nuala McElveen and Nuala Barrie), daughter of John A.

At the time of his death, he was the oldest living former member of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].\n\n==Military career==\nThe son of Brigadier General Walter Allason [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] & [[Medal bar|Bar]] (1875\u20131960) by his wife Katherine Hamilton Poland, daughter of Vice-Admiral James Augustus Poland,<ref>Burke's Landed Gentry, eighteenth edition, vol. I, ed.

Walter Allason was grandson of the architect [[Thomas Allason]].<ref>Burke's Landed Gentry, eighteenth edition, vol. I, ed. Peter Townend, 1965, Burke's Peerage Ltd, p. 9</ref>\n\nHe was educated at [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]] and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]]. He served as an officer in the [[British Army]] for 24 years from 1930 to 1954, including in [[India]], [[Ceylon]] and [[Burma]], rising to the rank of Lt-Colonel. He joined the [[Royal Artillery]] in 1932 transferring to the [[3rd Carabiniers]] in 1937. A gifted mathematician, he addressed the problem of using magnetic compasses with tanks: the Allason [[solar compass|Sun Compass]] was adopted for use throughout the Asian theatre.\n\nAllason worked with the Supreme Allied Commander, [[Lord Louis Mountbatten]], as joint planning staff officer in [[South East Asia Command]] and was wounded while commanding tanks during the [[Burma campaign]]. He was later decorated. He subsequently occupied a similar post as senior military planner at the [[War Office]] in London, answering [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]]'s queries and providing briefings in the [[Cabinet War Rooms]]. His last planning task was to advise on the logistics of withdrawing from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. From 1950 to 1954, he served at the [[War Office]] in charge of Army discipline.\n\n==Political career==\nAfter leaving the Army Allason worked as a [[Lloyd's of London]] insurance broker. He was elected a councillor on [[Metropolitan Borough of Kensington|Kensington Borough Council]] in 1956.\n\nAllason contested [[Hackney Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney Central]] in 1955. He was [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Hemel Hempstead (UK Parliament constituency)|Hemel Hempstead]] (after defeating Margaret Thatcher for the Conservative nomination) from 1959 to 1974, when, following boundary changes, he narrowly lost the seat in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October election of that year]] to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s [[Robin Corbett, Baron Corbett of Castle Vale|Robin Corbett]].\n\nIn government he was acknowledged for his expertise not only on defence but in the arcane but key subject of pensions. As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for War he had a ringside seat as the [[Profumo affair]] unfolded, refraining from publishing his inside account until after the death of Jack Profumo in March 2006.<ref>''The Mail on Sunday'', 12 March 2006</ref>\n\nWhen the Conservatives were in opposition Allason was front bench spokesman on Housing for six years, and is credited with development of the policy of enabling [[council house]] tenants to purchase their own properties: this was taken up by [[Margaret Thatcher]] and adopted by subsequent Conservative governments, contributing to their electoral victories. After leaving Parliament he continued to exercise a rational influence on environmental policy from positions on the executive of the [[Town and Country Planning Association]] and the Environment Council\u2019s Transport Committee.\n\nFollowing the deaths of [[Patrick Maitland, 17th Earl of Lauderdale]] in December 2008 and [[Bert Hazell]] in January 2009, Allason became the oldest living former British Member of Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Crick|first1=Michael|title=On the death of the oldest former MP, James Allason|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-13929445|website=bbc.com|accessdate=28 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Personal interests==\nAs a sportsman he raced Bentleys at [[Brooklands]], played polo with maharajahs in India, skied and sailed in international competition, and represented the House of Commons in five sports. He continued skiing until his 87th year, and continued to play [[Contract Bridge]] and attend the Opera, on which subjects he wrote.\n\nIn 1946, he married Nuala (who acted as Nuala McElveen and Nuala Barrie), daughter of John A. McArevey, of [[Foxrock]], [[Dublin]]. They had two sons, the younger of whom, the Intelligence historian [[Rupert Allason]], followed him into Parliament as Member for [[Torbay]].
