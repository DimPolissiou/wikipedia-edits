''[[Canis]]'' is the Latin word meaning \"dog\",<ref>{{OEtymD|canine}}</ref> and under this [[genus]] he listed the dog-like carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals. He classified the domestic dog as ''Canis familiaris'', and on the next page he classified the wolf as ''Canis lupus''.<ref name=linnaeus1758/> Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its ''cauda recurvata'' - its upturning tail which is not found in any other [[canid]].<ref name=Clutton-Brock1995/>\n\nIn 1999, a study of [[mitochondrial DNA]] indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from multiple grey [[wolf]] populations, with the [[dingo]] and [[New Guinea singing dog]] \"breeds\" having developed at a time when human populations were more isolated from each other.<ref name=wayne1999/> In the third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' published in 2005, the mammalogist [[:de:W.

Wozencraft included ''hallstromi'' \u2013 the [[New Guinea singing dog]] \u2013 as a [[taxonomic synonym]] for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mDNA study as one of the guides in forming his decision.<ref name=wozencraft2005/> The inclusion of ''familiaris'' and ''dingo'' under a \"domestic dog\" clade has been noted by other mammalogists.<ref name=jackson2017/> This classification by Wozencraft is debated among zoologists.<ref name=smithC1/>\n\nIn 2019, a workshop hosted by the [[IUCN]]/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea Singing Dog and the Dingo to be feral dogs ''Canis familiaris'', and therefore should not be assessed for the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=Alvares2019/>\n\n==Origin==\n{{Main|Origin of the domestic dog}}\n\nThe origin of the domestic dog includes the dog's [[evolutionary divergence]] from the wolf, its [[domestication]], and its development into [[dog types]] and [[dog breeds]]. The dog is a member of the [[genus]] ''[[Canis]]'', which forms part of the [[Evolution of the wolf#Wolf-like canids|wolf-like canids]], and was the first species and the only large [[carnivore]] to have been domesticated.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=freedman2017/> The dog and the extant gray wolf are [[sister taxa]], as modern wolves are not closely related to the population of wolves that was first [[Domestication|domesticated]].<ref name=larson2014/>\n\nThe [[genetic divergence]] between dogs and wolves occurred between 40,000\u201320,000 years ago, just before or during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].<ref name=Irving-Pease2018/><ref name=Thalmann2018/> This timespan represents the upper time-limit for the commencement of domestication because it is the time of divergence and not the time of domestication, which occurred later.<ref name=Irving-Pease2018/><ref name=machugh2016/> The [[domestication of animals]] commenced over 15,000 years ago, beginning with the [[grey wolf]] (''Canis lupus'') by nomadic [[hunter-gatherers]].<ref name=Irving-Pease2018/> The archaeological record and genetic analysis show the remains of the [[Origin of the domestic dog#Bonn\u2013Oberkassel dog|Bonn\u2013Oberkassel dog]] buried beside humans 14,200 years ago to be the first undisputed dog, with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago. The domestication of the dog predates agriculture.<ref name=Thalmann2018/> It was not until 11,000 years ago that people living in the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]] entered into relationships with wild populations of [[aurochs]], boar, sheep, and goats.<ref name=Irving-Pease2018/>\n\nWhere the domestication of the dog took place remains debated, with the most plausible proposals spanning [[Western Europe]],<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=machugh2016/> [[Central Asia]]<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=shannon2015/> and [[East Asia]].<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=wang2015/> This has been made more complicated by the recent proposal that an initial wolf population split into East and West [[Eurasian]] groups. These two groups, before going [[Extinction|extinct]], were domesticated independently into two distinct dog populations between 14,000 and 6,400 years ago. The Western Eurasian dog population was gradually and partially replaced by East Asian dogs introduced by humans at least 6,400 years ago.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=Thalmann2018/> This proposal is also debated.<ref name=Thalmann2018/>\n\nIn 2020, a [[literature review]] of canid domestication stated that modern dogs were not descended from the same ''Canis'' lineage as modern wolves, and proposes that dogs may be descended from a Pleistocene wolf closer in size to a village dog.<ref name=Lord2020/>\n\n==Biology==\n[[File:Dog anatomy lateral skeleton view.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Lateral view of skeleton]]\n\n===Anatomy===\n{{main|Dog anatomy}}\n[[File:Dog skull 06.jpg|thumb|Skull of a dog]]\nDomestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.<ref name=\"ADW\"/> Modern [[dog breed]]s show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal.<ref name=\"ADW\"/> Dogs are [[predation|predators]] and [[scavenger]]s; like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.\n\n====Size and weight====\nDogs are highly variable in height and weight.

This influence on human society has given them the [[sobriquet]] of \"[[man's best friend]]\".\n\n==Terminology==\n* The term ''dog'' typically is applied both to the species (or subspecies) as a whole, and any adult male member of the same.\n* An adult female is a ''bitch''.\n* An adult male capable of reproduction is a ''stud''.\n* An adult female capable of reproduction is a ''brood bitch'', or ''brood mother''.\n* Immature males or females (that is, animals that are incapable of reproduction) are ''pups'' or ''puppies''.\n* A group of pups from the same [[gestation period]] is called a ''[[Litter (animal)|litter]]''.\n* The father of a litter is a ''sire''. It is possible for one litter to have multiple sires.\n* The mother of a litter is a ''dam''.\n* A group of any three or more adults is a ''pack''.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n{{further|Canis lupus dingo#Taxonomic debate \u2013 dog, dingo, and New Guinea singing dog}}\n\nIn 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist [[Carl Linnaeus]] published in his ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]'' the [[binomial nomenclature]] \u2013 or the two-word naming \u2013 of [[species]]. ''[[Canis]]'' is the Latin word meaning \"dog\",<ref>{{OEtymD|canine}}</ref> and under this [[genus]] he listed the dog-like carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals. He classified the domestic dog as ''Canis familiaris'', and on the next page he classified the wolf as ''Canis lupus''.<ref name=linnaeus1758/> Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its ''cauda recurvata'' - its upturning tail which is not found in any other [[canid]].<ref name=Clutton-Brock1995/>\n\nIn 1999, a study of [[mitochondrial DNA]] indicated that the domestic dog may have originated from multiple grey [[wolf]] populations, with the [[dingo]] and [[New Guinea singing dog]] \"breeds\" having developed at a time when human populations were more isolated from each other.<ref name=wayne1999/> In the third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' published in 2005, the mammalogist [[:de:W. Christopher Wozencraft|W. Christopher Wozencraft]] listed under the wolf ''Canis lupus'' its wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: \"''familiaris'' Linneaus, 1758 [domestic dog]\" and \"''dingo'' Meyer, 1793 [domestic dog]\". Wozencraft included ''hallstromi'' \u2013 the [[New Guinea singing dog]] \u2013 as a [[taxonomic synonym]] for the dingo. Wozencraft referred to the mDNA study as one of the guides in forming his decision.<ref name=wozencraft2005/> The inclusion of ''familiaris'' and ''dingo'' under a \"domestic dog\" clade has been noted by other mammalogists.<ref name=jackson2017/> This classification by Wozencraft is debated among zoologists.<ref name=smithC1/>\n\nIn 2019, a workshop hosted by the [[IUCN]]/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea Singing Dog and the Dingo to be feral dogs ''Canis familiaris'', and therefore should not be assessed for the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=Alvares2019/>\n\n==Origin==\n{{Main|Origin of the domestic dog}}\n\nThe origin of the domestic dog includes the dog's [[evolutionary divergence]] from the wolf, its [[domestication]], and its development into [[dog types]] and [[dog breeds]]. The dog is a member of the [[genus]] ''[[Canis]]'', which forms part of the [[Evolution of the wolf#Wolf-like canids|wolf-like canids]], and was the first species and the only large [[carnivore]] to have been domesticated.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=freedman2017/> The dog and the extant gray wolf are [[sister taxa]], as modern wolves are not closely related to the population of wolves that was first [[Domestication|domesticated]].<ref name=larson2014/>\n\nThe [[genetic divergence]] between dogs and wolves occurred between 40,000\u201320,000 years ago, just before or during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].<ref name=Irving-Pease2018/><ref name=Thalmann2018/> This timespan represents the upper time-limit for the commencement of domestication because it is the time of divergence and not the time of domestication, which occurred later.<ref name=Irving-Pease2018/><ref name=machugh2016/> The [[domestication of animals]] commenced over 15,000 years ago, beginning with the [[grey wolf]] (''Canis lupus'') by nomadic [[hunter-gatherers]].<ref name=Irving-Pease2018/> The archaeological record and genetic analysis show the remains of the [[Origin of the domestic dog#Bonn\u2013Oberkassel dog|Bonn\u2013Oberkassel dog]] buried beside humans 14,200 years ago to be the first undisputed dog, with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago. The domestication of the dog predates agriculture.<ref name=Thalmann2018/> It was not until 11,000 years ago that people living in the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]] entered into relationships with wild populations of [[aurochs]], boar, sheep, and goats.<ref name=Irving-Pease2018/>\n\nWhere the domestication of the dog took place remains debated, with the most plausible proposals spanning [[Western Europe]],<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=machugh2016/> [[Central Asia]]<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=shannon2015/> and [[East Asia]].<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=wang2015/> This has been made more complicated by the recent proposal that an initial wolf population split into East and West [[Eurasian]] groups. These two groups, before going [[Extinction|extinct]], were domesticated independently into two distinct dog populations between 14,000 and 6,400 years ago. The Western Eurasian dog population was gradually and partially replaced by East Asian dogs introduced by humans at least 6,400 years ago.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=Thalmann2018/> This proposal is also debated.<ref name=Thalmann2018/>\n\nIn 2020, a [[literature review]] of canid domestication stated that modern dogs were not descended from the same ''Canis'' lineage as modern wolves, and proposes that dogs may be descended from a Pleistocene wolf closer in size to a village dog.<ref name=Lord2020/>\n\n==Biology==\n[[File:Dog anatomy lateral skeleton view.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Lateral view of skeleton]]\n\n===Anatomy===\n{{main|Dog anatomy}}\n[[File:Dog skull 06.jpg|thumb|Skull of a dog]]\nDomestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.<ref name=\"ADW\"/> Modern [[dog breed]]s show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal.<ref name=\"ADW\"/> Dogs are [[predation|predators]] and [[scavenger]]s; like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.\n\n====Size and weight====\nDogs are highly variable in height and weight.

The team first entered the Fej\u00e9r County Championship in 1942\u201343 and went on to win the championship. In 1948, the club was broken into three teams, with one team playing in the [[Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g III]] (third Division of the National Championship), one in the County Championship and the third one in the Second division of the County Championship. In 1950, the workers of the factory assembled their own team in the hope of achieving better results, and the club was renamed '''Vad\u00e1szt\u00f6lt\u00e9nygy\u00e1ri Vasas''' on 10 March. Later on they eventually agreed on 3 January 1956, that all teams would join forces in a unified team built on Vad\u00e1szt\u00f6lt\u00e9nygy\u00e1r. In that season the team won the County Championship by a very wide margin, and, after winning the following year's County Championship Winners Trophy, qualified for the [[Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g II]] (second Division of the National Championship) for the 1957\u201358 season.\n\n==1960s==\nThe first opportunity to play in [[Hungary]]'s highest league came along only a few years later. In the 1961\u201362 season the team finished in third position&nbsp;\u2013 barely qualifying for the first division. Known then as '''VT Vasas''', the dream finally came true in 1967 when the team finished second in the second division and was promoted to the top league.\n\nOn 22 January 1968, the club was renamed '''Videoton SC''', due to a sponsorship agreement with the electrical goods manufacturer [[Videoton (company)|Videoton]]. The first season in the top league wasn't very successful. The team won 9 games but lost 18 matches, finishing in 15th place, which resulted in them being relegated.\n\nHowever, the following year, Videoton bounced back and won the second division. The next five years saw the club consolidate its position in the first division by finishing tenth, seventh, fifth, fourth and again fifth. Then in the 1975\u201376 season the team achieved the best position in its history by finishing second.\n\nVideoton went on to produce modest results in the ensuing years, failing to finish in the top three on four occasions.

The team first entered the Fej\u00e9r County Championship in 1942\u201343 and went on to win the championship. In 1948, the club was broken into three teams, with one team playing in the [[Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g III]] (third Division of the National Championship), one in the County Championship and the third one in the Second division of the County Championship. In 1950, the workers of the factory assembled their own team in the hope of achieving better results, and the club was renamed '''Vad\u00e1szt\u00f6lt\u00e9nygy\u00e1ri Vasas''' on 10 March. Later on they eventually agreed on 3 January 1956, that all teams would join forces in a unified team built on Vad\u00e1szt\u00f6lt\u00e9nygy\u00e1r. In that season the team won the County Championship by a very wide margin, and, after winning the following year's County Championship Winners Trophy, qualified for the [[Nemzeti Bajnoks\u00e1g II]] (second Division of the National Championship) for the 1957\u201358 season.\n\n==1960s==\nThe first opportunity to play in [[Hungary]]'s highest league came along only a few years later.

Known then as '''VT Vasas''', the dream finally came true in 1967 when the team finished second in the second division and was promoted to the top league.\n\nOn 22 January 1968, the club was renamed '''Videoton SC''', due to a sponsorship agreement with the electrical goods manufacturer [[Videoton (company)|Videoton]]. The first season in the top league wasn't very successful. The team won 9 games but lost 18 matches, finishing in 15th place, which resulted in them being relegated.\n\nHowever, the following year, Videoton bounced back and won the second division. The next five years saw the club consolidate its position in the first division by finishing tenth, seventh, fifth, fourth and again fifth. Then in the 1975\u201376 season the team achieved the best position in its history by finishing second.\n\nVideoton went on to produce modest results in the ensuing years, failing to finish in the top three on four occasions. Finally, in 1982, the Fehervar club reached the final of the Hungarian Cup, but were defeated 2\u20130 by [[\u00dajpest FC|\u00dajpest]]. This was the beginning of the club's golden age. In 1984, the team finished third with the same number of points as [[Gy\u0151ri ETO FC|ETO Gy\u0151r]], who finished second, but due only to a superior head-to-head performance. That season saw, [[J\u00f3zsef Szab\u00f3 (footballer, born 1956)|J\u00f3zsef Szab\u00f3]] become the top goal-scorer in the 1st division with 19 goals.\n\n==1980s==\n{{football squad on pitch|align=left\n|  GK_nat = Hungary|  GK = [[P\u00e9ter Disztl|Disztl]]\n|  RB_nat = Hungary|  RB = [[Tibor V\u00e9gh|V\u00e9gh]]\n| RCB_nat = Hungary| RCB = [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Disztl|Disztl]]\n| LCB_nat = Hungary| LCB = [[J\u00f3zsef Csuhay|Csuhay]]\n|  LB_nat = Hungary|  LB = [[G\u00e1bor Horv\u00e1th (footballer born 1959)|Horv\u00e1th]]\n|  RM_nat = Hungary|  RM = [[Gy\u0151z\u0151 Burcsa|Burcsa]]\n| RCM_nat = Hungary| RCM = [[Ferenc Csongr\u00e1di|Csongr\u00e1di]]\n| LCM_nat = Hungary| LCM = [[Imre Vad\u00e1sz|Vad\u00e1sz]]\n|  LM_nat = Hungary|  LM = [[Lajos M\u00e1jer|M\u00e1jer]]\n|  CF_nat = Hungary|  CF = [[J\u00f3zsef Szab\u00f3 (footballer, born 1956)|Szab\u00f3]]\n|  AM_nat = Hungary|  AM = [[Gy\u00f6rgy Novath|Novath]]\n| caption = Videoton's linup in the [[1985 UEFA Cup Final]] against [[Real Madrid C.F.]] at the [[Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium]].\n}}\nThe club caught international attention when it reached the [[1985 UEFA Cup Final]] during a campaign under the management of [[Ferenc Kov\u00e1cs (footballer)|Ferenc Kov\u00e1cs]].\nIn the [[UEFA Cup 1984\u201385]] season Videoton overcame [[Dukla Prague]] (1\u20130, 0\u20130) in the first round,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=1984/matches/round=1121/index.html|title=UEFA Cup 1984\u201385: Videoton 1\u20130 Pribram|publisher=UEFA.com|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=1 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=1984/matches/round=1121/index.html|title=UEFA Cup 1984\u201385: Pribram 0\u20130 Videoton|publisher=UEFA.com|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=1 November 2012}}</ref> [[Paris Saint-Germain FC|Paris Saint-Germain]] (4\u20132, 2\u20130) in the second round,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=1984/matches/round=1122/index.html|title=UEFA Cup 1984\u201385: Paris Saint-Germain 2\u20134 Videoton|publisher=UEFA.com|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=1 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=1984/matches/round=1122/index.html|title=UEFA Cup 1984\u201385: Videoton 2\u20130 Paris Saint-Germain|publisher=UEFA.com|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=1 November 2012}}</ref> [[FK Partizan]] (0\u20132, 5\u20130) in the third round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=1984/matches/round=1123/index.html|title=UEFA Cup 1984\u201385: Videoton 5\u20130 Partizan|publisher=UEFA.com|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=1 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=1984/matches/round=1123/index.html|title=UEFA Cup 1984\u201385: Partizan 2\u20130 Videoton|publisher=UEFA.com|date=1 November 2012|accessdate=1 November 2012}}</ref> They then had further success in the quarter-finals where Videoton played against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].

However, they failed to achieve any significant results. The 1998 season saw them barely escape relegation, which surprised many. Finishing the season in 16th place, the club had to win a play-off against [[FC Sopron|Sopron]] to remain in the top flight. They managed to do this by winning both games 2\u20131 and 3\u20130.

This led to the team's only participation in the [[Intertoto Cup]], where they were defeated by [[PFC Marek Dupnitsa|Marek Dupnitsa]] in the first round. In 2005, the club changed its name to '''FC Feh\u00e9rvar'''. The next year saw the club's most successful domestic year. After a third-place finish, the first in 21 years, the team finally won the [[Hungarian Cup]] for the first time by defeating [[Vasas SC|Vasas]] 6\u20135 in a penalty shoot-out, after the match had finished 2\u20132 after extra time. A brand new main stand was erected and handed over in 2004. Videoton were close to bankruptcy when businessman Istv\u00e1n Garancsi rescued the club. He brought financial stability and a resurgence in fortunes on the pitch. 2008 saw the team win the first ever League Cup by defeating [[Debreceni VSC|Debrecen]] 3\u20130 on aggregate (Home 1\u20130; Away 2\u20130).
