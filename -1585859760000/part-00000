Alistair and Morrigan are straight and thus available to players of the opposite gender. There are also opportunities to have sexual encounters with NPCs of the same gender throughout the game and notably within the first 30 minutes of game play.

The prostitute Serendipity, though intended by writer Mary Kirby to be a male crossdresser and not a transgender woman, was read by many players as the latter.

In same-sex marriages, the player does not get paid \"[[dowry]]\" for marrying any male characters but almost all females give such. One quest involves finding the deed to a bordello so the player can free the prostitutes from the male owner. Like the other quests in the game there are several ways of solving this, but one option is to dress as a woman and have sex with the owner when he's drunk.\n\nIn ''Fable II'' (2008), there are more lesbian, gay, and bisexual NPC townspeople to court and marry. A context-specific line is used in a conversation within the middle of the game, wherein [[Fable II#Characters|Hammer]] asks if the protagonist was able to convince their partner, wife, or husband to wait for them when they must go away for ten years. The game also includes a quest in which the player character finds a suitable partner for a farmer's son who hints at being gay.

The 2015 expansion ''Knights of the Fallen Empire'' sees the return of Shan and Beniko, and introduces Koth Vortena; all three are fully realized romance options for characters male or female characters. All expansions have also featured background characters and flavor lore mentioning same-sex romances and even marriages.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |''[[Story of Seasons (series)|Story of Seasons]]''\n| 2014\n| Marian\n| Genderqueer\n| The androgynous male doctor Marian is often addressed with female pronouns and refers to herself as \"big sister\".{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n|[[Marvelous AQL]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |''[[Summon Night]]''\n| 2003\n|''[[Summon Night: Swordcraft Story]]''\n| Pratty, Sugar, Razzy and Sanary\n| Lesbian\n| Pratty is the female playable character.

He was a member of the [[Interwar period|interwar]] Chetnik Association and the [[Organization of Yugoslav Nationalists|Organisation of Yugoslav Nationalists]], a [[Yugoslav National Party]] member of the [[Parliament of Yugoslavia|National Assembly]], and a leader of the opposition to [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] between 1929 and 1934. The following year, he became the propaganda chief for the Yugoslav government.\n\nFollowing the Axis [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, he became a Chetnik leader in Herzegovina and joined the Chetnik movement of [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]]. Jev\u0111evi\u0107 [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborated]] with the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] and later the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] in actions against the [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. Although Jev\u0111evi\u0107 recognised the authority of Mihailovi\u0107, who was aware of and approved of his collaboration with Axis forces, a number of factors effectively rendered him independent of Mihailovi\u0107's command, except when he worked closely with [[Ilija Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin]], Mihailovi\u0107's designated commander in [[Dalmatia]], Herzegovina, western [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and southwestern [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]].\n\nDuring the joint Italian\u2013Chetnik [[Operation Alfa]], Jev\u0111evi\u0107's Chetniks, along with other Chetnik forces, were responsible for killing between 543 and 2,500 [[Bosniak|Bosnian Muslim]] and [[Croats|Catholic]] civilians in the [[Prozor-Rama|Prozor]] region in October 1942. They also participated in one of the largest Axis anti-Partisan operations of the war, [[Case White]], in the winter of 1943. His Chetniks later merged with other collaborationist forces that had withdrawn towards the west, and were put under the command of ''SS-[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Odilo Globocnik]] of the [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]]. Jev\u0111evi\u0107 fled to Italy in the spring of 1945, where he was arrested by Allied military authorities and detained at a camp in [[Grottaglie]]. He was eventually set free, having received considerable Allied support. Yugoslavia's requests for extradition were ignored. Jev\u0111evi\u0107 moved to [[Rome]] and lived under an assumed name. In the years following the war, he collected reports for various western intelligence services and printed anti-communist publications. He resided in Rome until his death in October 1962.\n\n==Early life and political career==\nDobroslav Jev\u0111evi\u0107 was born on 28 December 1895 in the hamlet of Milo\u0161evac{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} in [[Pra\u010da (Pale-Pra\u010da)|Pra\u010da]], near the town of [[Rogatica]],{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|p=172}} in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-occupied [[Bosnia Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], to Dimitrije and Angela Jev\u0111evi\u0107 ({{n\u00e9e}} Kosori\u0107).{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107's father was a [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] priest,{{sfn|\u0106orovi\u0107|1996|p=60}} and the family was of Montenegrin Serb origin.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency February 1952}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 was raised in the Christian faith and attended secondary school in [[Sarajevo]].{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} There, he joined the revolutionary organisation known as [[Young Bosnia]] and became a friend of [[Gavrilo Princip]], the assassin who [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|killed]] [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] on 28 June 1914.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=88}} The day of the assassination, Jev\u0111evi\u0107's father was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian police for his connections with the Serb revolutionary organisation ''[[Narodna Odbrana]]'' (National Defence).{{sfn|\u0106orovi\u0107|1996|pp=60\u201362}} He was charged with high treason, sentenced to death by hanging in April 1916 and executed in [[Banja Luka]].{{sfn|\u0106orovi\u0107|1996|p=175}}\n\nJev\u0111evi\u0107 was a successful writer and poet in his youth. He studied law at the universities of [[Zagreb]], [[Belgrade]], and [[Vienna]] and spoke Serbian, Italian, German and French.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107's political career began in 1918.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency February 1952}} During the [[interwar period]], he was one of the most influential Serb politicians in Bosnia.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} He was a member of the [[Chetniks in the interwar period|Chetnik Association]], an aggressively Serb-[[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] political movement of over 500,000 members led by [[Kosta Pe\u0107anac]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=158}}{{sfn|Singleton|1985|p=188}} He was also one of the leaders of the [[Independent Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Independent Democratic Party of Yugoslavia]] and headed the movement's military wing, the [[ORJUNA|Organisation of Yugoslav Nationalists]], which terrorised those Serbs in Bosnia, Herzegovina and Croatia who refused to join the party.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 later became a parliamentary candidate of the opposition [[Yugoslav National Party]] in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=46}} He was elected to the Yugoslav Parliament a total of four times,{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=71}} representing the district of Rogatica then [[Novi Sad]],{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|p=172}} and was an opposition leader during King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]]'s dictatorship of 1929\u201334.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=71}} His tendency to cooperate with various Yugoslav political factions earned him the reputation of \"being willing to sell himself to any political group in return for personal favours or advancement\". In 1935, he was appointed as the Yugoslav government's propaganda chief by [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|Prime Minister]] [[Bogoljub Jevti\u0107]].{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency February 1952}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 approved of the creation of the [[Banovina of Croatia]] in 1939 and advocated a large Serb counterpart that would include most of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This advocacy drew him close to the various Chetnik associations that existed during the interwar period.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=46}} In 1941, his cousin, Colonel Du\u0161an Radovi\u0107, left Yugoslavia and joined the [[Royal Air Force]].{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}}\n\n==World War II==\nJev\u0111evi\u0107 fled to [[Budva]] on the Montenegrin coast following the [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941.{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|p=172}} That month, the Germans and Italians created a [[puppet state]] known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska|links=no}}; NDH), which implemented genocidal policies against [[Serbs]], [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Romanis]].{{sfn|Hoare|2007|pp=20\u201324}} The Serb population began to resist, and Jev\u0111evi\u0107 became a prominent leader of the Chetnik uprising against NDH authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1941.{{sfn|Red\u017ei\u0107|2005|p=20}}\n\nHe was known for his pro-Italian sympathies prior to the war, and Chetnik leader [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]] jokingly described him as \"an Italian who likes Serbs\".{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency February 1952}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and pre-war Chetnik leader [[Ilija Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin]] sought to work with the Italians in the belief that an Italian occupation of both Bosnia and Herzegovina would limit the ability of the NDH to carry out its anti-Serb policies.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=70\u201371}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 reportedly hoped that the Italians would allow the formation of a Serbian state of Bosnia and Herzegovina under their protection, but they were more interested in obtaining the practical assistance of his Chetniks in fighting the Partisans than helping him achieve his political aims.{{sfn|Red\u017ei\u0107|2005|p=20}} In the summer of 1941, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 established links with the Italians, promoting Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin and himself as civilian intermediaries for the eastern Bosnian Chetniks of [[Jezdimir Dangi\u0107]].{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=70}}\n\nOn 20 October 1941, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin met and agreed to collaborate with the head of the information division of the Italian [[VI Corps (Italy)|VI Corps]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=147}} In late January 1942, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 offered to assist the Italians if they occupied Bosnia, and to organise Chetnik detachments to work alongside Italian units in their fight against the [[communist]]-led [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]].{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=71}} These contacts involved General [[Renzo Dalmazzo]], commander of the Italian VI Corps, and Chetnik leaders [[Stevo Ra\u0111enovi\u0107]], Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin, Dangi\u0107 and Jev\u0111evi\u0107.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=147}} In February, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 consulted with one of Dangi\u0107's supporters, [[Bo\u0161ko Todorovi\u0107]], who instructed him to negotiate with the new commander of the Italian [[Second Army (Italy)|Second Army]], [[Mario Roatta]], to arrange the withdrawal of NDH and German troops from eastern Bosnia, to be replaced by an exclusively Italian administration. Both Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Todorovi\u0107 impressed Dalmazzo with the influence they were able to exert over the eastern Bosnian Chetniks, but Todorovi\u0107 was killed by the Partisans in Herzegovina in late February. The influence Jev\u0111evi\u0107 had was demonstrated when Serb nationalist armed groups in the [[Gora\u017ede]] and [[Fo\u010da]] districts swung over to an anti-Partisan and pro-Italian attitude when they were informed of Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin's ties with VI Corps headquarters. The plans for Italian expansion into eastern Bosnia were later discussed between Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and NDH State Secretary [[Vjekoslav Vran\u010di\u0107]].{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=71\u201373}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|By April 1942, the Germans had become aware of these Italian-Chetnik plans and had arrested Dangi\u0107 during a visit to the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|German-occupied territory of Serbia]].{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=71\u201373}}}}\n\nDalmazzo urged Roatta to expand Italian links with Serb nationalist groups into an alliance with them. At this time, the Italians were looking for allies to restore order, fight the Partisans, and support their political claims to NDH territory, and were under the impression that the various Serb nationalist groups were far better organised than they actually were. For example, Roatta was under the impression that Jev\u0111evi\u0107 represented the Herzegovinian Chetniks, and that they were aligned with Dangi\u0107. In early March, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin suddenly told the Italians that they were effectively in control of a Chetnik movement, and were ready to collaborate with the Italians on the latter's terms. Jev\u0111evi\u0107 sent a message to Dalmazzo explaining that the Herzegovinian Chetniks wanted to avenge Todorovi\u0107 and were concentrating around [[Nevesinje]] ready to demonstrate their loyalty to the Italians. Despite their statements, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin faced significant difficulties; the Serb nationalist groups had yet to demonstrate their military value to the Italians, and not all of the armed groups even acknowledged their leadership.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=71\u201373}}\n\nIn the spring and summer of 1942, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin regularly toured villages in the Gora\u017ede, [[Kalinovik]] and Fo\u010da districts, encouraging the local civilians and Chetnik detachments to behave loyally towards the Italians.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=75}} The Italians were unable to gain German support for their plan to use Chetnik groups as [[auxiliaries]] during the joint Italian-German anti-Partisan [[Operation Trio]] in April\u2013May.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=73}} In May, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 met with German intelligence officers in [[Dubrovnik]] and was asked whether he would cooperate in the pacification of Bosnia.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=80}} Mihailovi\u0107 was aware of and condoned the collaborationist arrangements entered into by Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=148}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin frequently met with Chetnik commander [[Mom\u010dilo \u0110uji\u0107]] in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], and the three men quarrelled over how to divide the financial assistance they were receiving from the Italians.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 19 April 1950}}\n[[File:Axis occupation of Yugoslavia 1941-43.png|thumb|Map showing the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia from 1941\u201343, including the demarcation line between the German and Italian zones|alt=map showing the partition of Yugoslavia, 1941\u201343]]\nIn an internal Chetnik report of June 1942, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 claimed that the Partisan proletarian brigades contained many \"Jews, Gypsies and Muslims\".

Two-thirds of their officers are former Croatian officers. The financing of their movement is carried out by the powerful Croatian capitalists of Zagreb, Split, Sarajevo and Dubrovnik. Fifty percent of the Usta\u0161e responsible for the massacres of Serbs are now in their ranks.}}\n\nJev\u0111evi\u0107 charged the Partisans with having \"destroyed Serb churches and established [[mosque]]s, [[synagogue]]s and Catholic temples\".{{sfn|Hoare|2006|pp=159\u2013160}} In mid-1942, the Chetniks became aware that the Italians were planning to largely withdraw from significant parts of the NDH that they had been occupying in force up to that time. Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin told the Italians that in response to this, Mihailovi\u0107 was considering evacuating Serb civilians from Herzegovina to Montenegro and moving Montenegrin Chetniks north to meet the [[Usta\u0161e]], who were expected to unleash a new wave of violence on Serb civilians.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=95}} Over 22\u201323 July 1942, Mihailovi\u0107 chaired a conference with Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin in [[Avtovac]], Herzegovina. On the second day of the conference, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin traveled to nearby [[Trebinje]] where they conferred with Herzegovinian Chetnik leaders [[Radmilo Gr\u0111i\u0107]] and [[Milan \u0160anti\u0107]]. The German consulate in Sarajevo reported that this meeting established the ultimate goals and immediate strategy of the Herzegovinian Chetniks as:{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=94\u201395}}\n\n{{quote\n|(1) the creation of [[Greater Serbia]]; (2) the destruction of the Partisans; (3) the removal of the Catholics and Muslims; (4) non-recognition of Croatia; (5) no collaboration with the Germans; and (6) temporary collaboration with the Italians for weapons, ammunition and food.\n}}\n\nUnder the auspices of the Italians, the Chetniks thoroughly [[ethnically cleansed]] eastern Herzegovina of its Croats and Muslims in July and August 1942.{{sfn|Goldstein 19 October 2012}} In response to a massacre of non-Serbs in Fo\u010da in August, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 issued a proclamation to the Muslims in eastern Herzegovina demanding that they join the Chetniks in their struggle against the Usta\u0161e. He stated: \"I personally believe that in a future state the Muslims have no other choice but to finally and definitely accept Serb nationality and renounce their speculative maneuvering between the Serb and Croat nations, above all because all the lands in which the Muslims live will indisputably and inviolably become part of the Serb state entity.\"{{sfn|Hoare|2013|p=48}} That month, Roatta contacted Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and \"legalised\" 3,000 of his Chetniks, formally authorising them to operate in eastern Herzegovina.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=148}}\n\nIn the autumn of 1942, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 took a radically different approach than other Chetnik leaders and spoke in favour of collaborating with the Muslims to form Muslim Chetnik units in the fight against the Usta\u0161e and the Partisans.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=308}} He favoured such tolerance in areas where the Muslims were protected by the Germans,{{sfn|Red\u017ei\u0107|2005|p=174}} and considered it a tactical necessity while stressing that \"there can be no true unity with them\".{{sfn|Malcolm|1996|p=187}} In late September or early October 1942, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Chetnik commander [[Petar Ba\u0107ovi\u0107]] held talks with Muslim leader [[Ismet Popovac]] and agreed to form a Muslim Chetnik organisation.{{sfn|Hoare|2013|p=49}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 then urged the Italian military to occupy all of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to end Usta\u0161e rule and claimed the support of 80 percent of the population, consisting of Serbs and Muslims. At the same time, he requested that the Germans grant autonomy to Bosnia and Herzegovina until the end of the war, citing that the Muslims were \"tested friends of the Germans both in the earlier and in the present era\". Although Jev\u0111evi\u0107 attempted to recruit Muslims while making use of the Bosnian desire for autonomy to support his alliance with the occupying Axis powers, nothing developed from these requests.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=308}}\n\n===Operation Alfa===\n{{main|Operation Alfa}}\nTowards the end of August 1942, Mihailovi\u0107 issued directives to Chetnik units, including those operating in the NDH such as Jev\u0111evi\u0107's forces, ordering them to prepare for a large scale anti-Partisan operation alongside Italian and NDH troops.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=97}} In September 1942, aware that they were unable to defeat the Partisans alone, the Chetniks tried to persuade the Italians to undertake a large operation against the Partisans in western Bosnia. Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin met with Roatta on 10 and 21 September and urged him to undertake this operation as soon as possible to clear the Partisans from the [[Prozor-Rama|Prozor]]\u2013[[Livno]] area and offered 7,500 Chetniks as aid on the condition they be given the necessary arms and supplies. He was successful in obtaining some arms and promises of action.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=232\u2013233}} The proposed operation, faced with opposition from Usta\u0161e leader [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] and a cautious Italian high command, was nearly cancelled, but after Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin promised to cooperate with Croat and Muslim anti-Partisan units, it went ahead, with less Chetnik involvement.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=97\u2013100}}\n\nIn early October 1942, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Ba\u0107ovi\u0107, with 3,000 Chetniks from Herzegovina and southeast Bosnia, participated in the Italian-led [[Operation Alfa]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=232\u2013233}} This involved a two-pronged thrust towards the town of Prozor. German and NDH troops drove from the north, and Italian and Chetnik forces pushed from the [[Neretva]] River.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=100}} Prozor and some smaller towns were captured by the combined Italian\u2013Chetnik force. Individual Chetnik bands, acting on their own, proceeded to burn a number of Muslim and Catholic villages, and killed between 543 and 2,500 non-Serbs in the Prozor area.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=232\u2013233}}{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=100}}{{sfn|Dedijer|Mileti\u0107|1990|p=581}}{{sfn|Goldstein 7 November 2012}} Their behaviour angered the NDH government and the Italians had to order the Chetniks to withdraw. Some were discharged altogether while others were sent to northern [[Dalmatia]] to aid \u0110uji\u0107's forces.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=232\u2013233}} A month after the massacre, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Ba\u0107ovi\u0107 wrote a self-critical report on Prozor to Mihailovi\u0107, hoping to distance themselves from the actions of the troops.{{sfn|Goldstein 7 November 2012}}\n\n===Case White===\n{{main|Case White}}\n[[File:Jevdjevic and Italians.jpg|Jev\u0111evi\u0107 conferring with Italian officers in February 1943|thumb|left|alt=A tall male Chetnik amongst a group of men dressed in Italian Army uniform]]\nIn a meeting with Roatta in November 1942, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 obtained Italian agreement to \"legalise\" another 3,000 Chetniks and recognition of almost all of eastern Herzegovina as a \"Chetnik zone\". In return, the Chetniks had to promise not to attack Muslim and Croat civilians and agreed to having an Italian liaison officer embedded in all their formations of regiment strength or more. On 15 November 1942, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 agreed to support the Italian decision to start arming Muslim anti-Partisan groups. This support almost cost him his life when several Chetniks, who strongly opposed the arming of Croat and Muslim anti-Partisan groups by the Italians, visited [[Mostar]] with the intention of assassinating him.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=106\u201308}}\n\nBy the end of 1942, Chetnik\u2013Italian collaboration was routine.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=148}} Chetnik forces were included in the Italian planning for [[Case White]], a major Axis anti-Partisan offensive which was to be launched on 20 January 1943. On 3 January, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 participated in an Axis planning conference for Case White in [[Rome]], along with senior German, Italian and NDH commanders.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=103\u201304}} The plans included the 12,000 Chetniks under Jev\u0111evi\u0107's command,{{sfn|Red\u017ei\u0107|2005|p=36}} and on 23 February 1943 he concluded an agreement with the Germans that they would not cross the Neretva River and that contact between German and Chetnik troops would be avoided.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=241}} Early in the operation, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 concluded an agreement for cooperation with the commander of NDH troops in Mostar.{{sfn|Red\u017ei\u0107|2005|p=99}} Later in the operation Jev\u0111evi\u0107 requested, through the Italians, the assistance of the [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen]] in defending Nevesinje, which faced severe pressure from Partisan forces that had broken through the Chetnik lines at the Battle of the Neretva River. Although the Italians also made this request themselves, the Germans declined, stating that the division was reserved for other tasks.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=248}}\n\nAfter the death of Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin in February 1943, Jev\u0111evi\u0107, along with \u0110uji\u0107, Ba\u0107ovi\u0107, and [[Radovan Ivani\u0161evi\u0107]], vowed to the Italians to carry on Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin's policies of closely collaborating with them against the Partisans. The Italians were able to exert pressure on Jev\u0111evi\u0107, as his brother and fianc\u00e9e were interned in Italy.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=218}} Mihailovi\u0107 apparently felt that Jev\u0111evi\u0107 had exceeded his authority by attending the Case White planning conference in Rome, and indeed, when the Yugoslav government-in-exile awarded Jev\u0111evi\u0107 the [[Order of Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star]] in early 1943 for his services to the Serb population during the Usta\u0161e massacres of 1941, Mihailovi\u0107 suppressed the announcement of the award because of the nature of Jev\u0111evi\u0107's agreement with the Italians, although the reason may also have been because he was aware of Chetnik revenge killings of Herzegovinian Catholics and Muslims in response to atrocities committed by the Usta\u0161e in Croatia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=68}} Tensions between Mihailovi\u0107 and Jev\u0111evi\u0107 became so apparent that Mihailovi\u0107 reportedly threatened to \"string [him] up from the nearest tree\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=125}} In March, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 publicly demanded an end to the Chetnik killing of Croats in Herzegovina.{{sfn|Red\u017ei\u0107|2005|p=146}} In May, [[Benito Mussolini]] finally gave in to German pressure and ordered Italian troops to co-operate in the disarming of Chetnik groups. Jev\u0111evi\u0107 was immediately placed under house arrest.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=148}}\n\nHis house arrest did not last long, as in the following month, Mihailovi\u0107 sent Jev\u0111evi\u0107 to Slovenia to report on the state of Chetnik forces there.{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|p=172}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 began developing contacts with the Germans prior to the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Italian capitulation]] in September 1943.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=146}} On 3 September, he travelled to Rome via [[Rijeka]] and made contact with German intelligence services.{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|p=172}} This marked the beginning of his collaboration with the Germans.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=428}} Following the German occupation of NDH territory that had previously been held by the Italians, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 moved to Trieste and stayed at the Hotel Continental.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} There, he helped organise displaced Chetniks and arranged for them to be returned to the town of [[Opatija]].{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|p=172}} He stayed in Trieste until January 1944,{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} when he relocated to Opatija with Chetniks from Trieste who had been placed under his command. He then moved his Chetniks to [[Ilirska Bistrica]],{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|p=172}} and collaborated with the Germans until the end of the war.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=428}}\n\n===Withdrawal===\nIn December 1944, Jev\u0111evi\u0107's 3,000 remaining fighters{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=442}} joined \u0110uji\u0107's Chetniks, [[Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107]]'s [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]], and the remnants of [[Milan Nedi\u0107]]'s [[Serbian State Guard|Serbian Shock Corps]], which were under the command of  ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer|SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer und General der Waffen-SS]]'' (SS General) [[Odilo Globocnik]], the [[Higher SS and Police Leader]] of the [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral|Adriatic Littoral]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=449}} Despite this, they attempted to contact the western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in Italy in an effort to secure foreign aid for a proposed anti-communist offensive to restore royalist Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|p=111}} They were all blessed by Serbian Orthodox bishop [[Nikolaj Velimirovi\u0107]] upon his arrival in Slovenia.{{sfn|Byford|2004|p=11}}{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=60}} On 11 April 1945, a detachment of Jev\u0111evi\u0107's Chetniks, along with three regiments of the Serbian Volunteer Corps, marched into south-western Croatia with the aim of linking up with the [[Montenegrin Volunteer Corps]] of [[Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107]], which was marching across Bosnia in an attempt to reach Slovenia. The relief effort came too late, because the Montenegrin Volunteer Corps had already been defeated by NDH forces at the [[Battle of Lijev\u010de Field]] near [[Banja Luka]], after which \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 was captured and killed. The relief force then marched north to Slovenia, where it fought the Partisans before retreating into Austria. These Chetniks were subsequently captured by the Allies and [[Bleiburg repatriations|repatriated to Yugoslavia]], where they were summarily executed by the Partisans.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=449}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 remained highly influential among the Chetniks until the end of the war.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=158}}\n\n==Exile and death==\n\n===Release from captivity===\nIn the spring of 1945, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 fled to Italy, where he was arrested by Allied forces and detained at a camp in [[Grottaglie]].{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|pp=172\u2013173}} An estimated 10,000 Chetniks reportedly followed him and \u0110uji\u0107 into the country.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 was interned in Grottaglie for some time along with others, including the former Usta\u0161e commissioner for Banja Luka, [[Viktor Guti\u0107]].{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|pp=172\u2013173}} During this time, an indictment was issued against him in Sarajevo. It charged that under his command in \"the first half of October 1942 in and around Prozor [the Italians and Chetniks] butchered and killed 1,716 persons of both sexes, of the Croatian and Muslim nations, and plundered and burnt about 500 households\".{{sfn|Goldstein 7 November 2012}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 received considerable Allied support in Italy despite being wanted by British authorities in connection with these allegations.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} On paper, the Chetniks in Italy were listed as \"surrendered enemy personnel\", but were largely viewed with sympathy by the Allies, who considered them anti-German. Hence, many Chetnik prisoners were handed British Army uniforms and given non-combatant duties throughout Italy, such as guarding munitions and supplies.{{sfn|Judah|2000|p=124}} In August 1945, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 became the commander of a camp for disarmed Chetniks in [[Cesena]].{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} He was eventually set free and Yugoslavia's requests for extradition were ignored.{{sfn|Goldstein 7 November 2012}}\n\n===Intelligence-gathering activities===\n[[File:Dobroslav Jev\u0111evi\u0107 CIA intelligence chart.png|thumb|220px|A [[Central Intelligence Agency]] chart illustrating the flow of the information generated by Jev\u0111evi\u0107.]]\nAccording to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), Jev\u0111evi\u0107 lived in Rome under the aliases \"Giovanni St. Angelo\"{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} and \"Enrico Serrao\".{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency February 1952}} He spent most of his time and money quarrelling with \u00e9migr\u00e9 Yugoslav politicians, trying to prove that his collaboration with the Italians was necessary in order to protect the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the Partisans and Germans.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} He became a member of the Association of Free Journalists of Central-Eastern Europe, and served as an informant for the Italian intelligence services between 1946 and 1947. During this period, he published a confidential periodical called the ''Royal Yugoslav Intelligence Bulletin'' which he shared with the Italians. Jev\u0111evi\u0107 also contributed to a number of newspapers, including the Serb nationalist ''Srbobran''. In 1946, he helped form the Serbian National Committee in Rome and, with help from Achille Marazza, published a pan-Serb and anti-Croat newspaper, ''Srpske Novine'', in [[Eboli]]. He also established contacts with Italian neo-fascist groups and with an anti-communist group called the Committee of Nations Oppressed by Russia.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency February 1952}}\n\nDisagreement over who would lead the 10,000 Chetnik exiles in Italy escalated into a feud between Jev\u0111evi\u0107, \u0110uji\u0107 and General Miodrag Damjanovi\u0107 in mid-1947.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} Damjanovi\u0107 had been appointed by Mihailovi\u0107 in March 1945 to lead the Chetniks into northwestern Italy.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=191}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and \u0110uji\u0107 refused to accept this and claimed that they were Mihailovi\u0107's only successors as leaders of the Chetnik movement.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}}\n\nBy 1949, the CIA claimed that Jev\u0111evi\u0107's intelligence material was being used by the [[Italian Ministry of Interior]], the [[Counterintelligence Corps (United States Army)|United States Counterintelligence Corps]], [[Forensic Science Service|British Forensic Science Service]] in Trieste, and French intelligence services in Rome and [[Paris]]. His intelligence correspondents included \u0110uji\u0107, who disseminated his intelligence reports to the CIA, [[Konstantin Foti\u0107]], the former Yugoslav ambassador to the [[United States]], and [[Miro Didek]], Croat politician [[Vladko Ma\u010dek]]'s self-styled intelligence representative in Rome. The intelligence reports were mostly collected from refugees fleeing Yugoslavia and arriving in Italy via Trieste and from \u00e9migr\u00e9 groups in Italy and Greece. By 1949, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 claimed to have formed a large network of anti-communist propagandists in Italy and intelligence collection centres in Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. The CIA believed that these claims were exaggerated, if not entirely fictitious.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency February 1952}} In 1951, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 began printing an anti-communist, pro-Chetnik publication from an unidentified religious institution in Italy. Issues were regularly mailed to Yugoslav exiles and former Chetniks living in the United States, [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and various European countries.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}}\n\nIn May and June 1952, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 visited Canada and addressed the Congress of the Serbian National Defence (''Srpska Narodna Odbrana'') in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] regarding developments within Italy's Serb \u00e9migr\u00e9 community. The following year, he and \u0110uji\u0107 issued a proclamation in [[Chicago]] declaring their intention to organise Chetnik groups against Damjanovi\u0107, who had since emigrated to Germany. Jev\u0111evi\u0107 later received threatening letters warning him not to go through with such a plan for fear of disuniting the Yugoslav diaspora. Little is known of his activities after 1953.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} He continued to live in Rome until his death in October 1962.{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n;Books\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book \n  | last = Cohen \n  | first = Philip J.\n  | authorlink = Philip J.

December 1895&nbsp;\u2013 October 1962) was a [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] politician and self-appointed [[Chetnik]] commander ({{Lang-hbs-Latn|vojvoda}}, \u0432\u043e\u0458\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430) in the [[Herzegovina]] region of the [[Axis powers|Axis]]-occupied [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] during [[World War II]]. He was a member of the [[Interwar period|interwar]] Chetnik Association and the [[Organization of Yugoslav Nationalists|Organisation of Yugoslav Nationalists]], a [[Yugoslav National Party]] member of the [[Parliament of Yugoslavia|National Assembly]], and a leader of the opposition to [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] between 1929 and 1934. The following year, he became the propaganda chief for the Yugoslav government.\n\nFollowing the Axis [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, he became a Chetnik leader in Herzegovina and joined the Chetnik movement of [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]]. Jev\u0111evi\u0107 [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborated]] with the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] and later the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] in actions against the [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. Although Jev\u0111evi\u0107 recognised the authority of Mihailovi\u0107, who was aware of and approved of his collaboration with Axis forces, a number of factors effectively rendered him independent of Mihailovi\u0107's command, except when he worked closely with [[Ilija Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin]], Mihailovi\u0107's designated commander in [[Dalmatia]], Herzegovina, western [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and southwestern [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]].\n\nDuring the joint Italian\u2013Chetnik [[Operation Alfa]], Jev\u0111evi\u0107's Chetniks, along with other Chetnik forces, were responsible for killing between 543 and 2,500 [[Bosniak|Bosnian Muslim]] and [[Croats|Catholic]] civilians in the [[Prozor-Rama|Prozor]] region in October 1942. They also participated in one of the largest Axis anti-Partisan operations of the war, [[Case White]], in the winter of 1943. His Chetniks later merged with other collaborationist forces that had withdrawn towards the west, and were put under the command of ''SS-[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Odilo Globocnik]] of the [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]]. Jev\u0111evi\u0107 fled to Italy in the spring of 1945, where he was arrested by Allied military authorities and detained at a camp in [[Grottaglie]]. He was eventually set free, having received considerable Allied support. Yugoslavia's requests for extradition were ignored. Jev\u0111evi\u0107 moved to [[Rome]] and lived under an assumed name. In the years following the war, he collected reports for various western intelligence services and printed anti-communist publications. He resided in Rome until his death in October 1962.\n\n==Early life and political career==\nDobroslav Jev\u0111evi\u0107 was born on 28 December 1895 in the hamlet of Milo\u0161evac{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} in [[Pra\u010da (Pale-Pra\u010da)|Pra\u010da]], near the town of [[Rogatica]],{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|p=172}} in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-occupied [[Bosnia Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], to Dimitrije and Angela Jev\u0111evi\u0107 ({{n\u00e9e}} Kosori\u0107).{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107's father was a [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] priest,{{sfn|\u0106orovi\u0107|1996|p=60}} and the family was of Montenegrin Serb origin.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency February 1952}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 was raised in the Christian faith and attended secondary school in [[Sarajevo]].{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} There, he joined the revolutionary organisation known as [[Young Bosnia]] and became a friend of [[Gavrilo Princip]], the assassin who [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|killed]] [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] on 28 June 1914.{{sfn|Hoare|2007|p=88}} The day of the assassination, Jev\u0111evi\u0107's father was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian police for his connections with the Serb revolutionary organisation ''[[Narodna Odbrana]]'' (National Defence).{{sfn|\u0106orovi\u0107|1996|pp=60\u201362}} He was charged with high treason, sentenced to death by hanging in April 1916 and executed in [[Banja Luka]].{{sfn|\u0106orovi\u0107|1996|p=175}}\n\nJev\u0111evi\u0107 was a successful writer and poet in his youth. He studied law at the universities of [[Zagreb]], [[Belgrade]], and [[Vienna]] and spoke Serbian, Italian, German and French.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107's political career began in 1918.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency February 1952}} During the [[interwar period]], he was one of the most influential Serb politicians in Bosnia.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} He was a member of the [[Chetniks in the interwar period|Chetnik Association]], an aggressively Serb-[[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] political movement of over 500,000 members led by [[Kosta Pe\u0107anac]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=158}}{{sfn|Singleton|1985|p=188}} He was also one of the leaders of the [[Independent Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Independent Democratic Party of Yugoslavia]] and headed the movement's military wing, the [[ORJUNA|Organisation of Yugoslav Nationalists]], which terrorised those Serbs in Bosnia, Herzegovina and Croatia who refused to join the party.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 later became a parliamentary candidate of the opposition [[Yugoslav National Party]] in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=46}} He was elected to the Yugoslav Parliament a total of four times,{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=71}} representing the district of Rogatica then [[Novi Sad]],{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|p=172}} and was an opposition leader during King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]]'s dictatorship of 1929\u201334.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=71}} His tendency to cooperate with various Yugoslav political factions earned him the reputation of \"being willing to sell himself to any political group in return for personal favours or advancement\". In 1935, he was appointed as the Yugoslav government's propaganda chief by [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|Prime Minister]] [[Bogoljub Jevti\u0107]].{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency February 1952}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 approved of the creation of the [[Banovina of Croatia]] in 1939 and advocated a large Serb counterpart that would include most of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This advocacy drew him close to the various Chetnik associations that existed during the interwar period.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=46}} In 1941, his cousin, Colonel Du\u0161an Radovi\u0107, left Yugoslavia and joined the [[Royal Air Force]].{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}}\n\n==World War II==\nJev\u0111evi\u0107 fled to [[Budva]] on the Montenegrin coast following the [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941.{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|p=172}} That month, the Germans and Italians created a [[puppet state]] known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] ({{lang-hr|Nezavisna Dr\u017eava Hrvatska|links=no}}; NDH), which implemented genocidal policies against [[Serbs]], [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Romanis]].{{sfn|Hoare|2007|pp=20\u201324}} The Serb population began to resist, and Jev\u0111evi\u0107 became a prominent leader of the Chetnik uprising against NDH authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1941.{{sfn|Red\u017ei\u0107|2005|p=20}}\n\nHe was known for his pro-Italian sympathies prior to the war, and Chetnik leader [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]] jokingly described him as \"an Italian who likes Serbs\".{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency February 1952}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and pre-war Chetnik leader [[Ilija Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin]] sought to work with the Italians in the belief that an Italian occupation of both Bosnia and Herzegovina would limit the ability of the NDH to carry out its anti-Serb policies.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=70\u201371}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 reportedly hoped that the Italians would allow the formation of a Serbian state of Bosnia and Herzegovina under their protection, but they were more interested in obtaining the practical assistance of his Chetniks in fighting the Partisans than helping him achieve his political aims.{{sfn|Red\u017ei\u0107|2005|p=20}} In the summer of 1941, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 established links with the Italians, promoting Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin and himself as civilian intermediaries for the eastern Bosnian Chetniks of [[Jezdimir Dangi\u0107]].{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=70}}\n\nOn 20 October 1941, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin met and agreed to collaborate with the head of the information division of the Italian [[VI Corps (Italy)|VI Corps]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=147}} In late January 1942, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 offered to assist the Italians if they occupied Bosnia, and to organise Chetnik detachments to work alongside Italian units in their fight against the [[communist]]-led [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]].{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=71}} These contacts involved General [[Renzo Dalmazzo]], commander of the Italian VI Corps, and Chetnik leaders [[Stevo Ra\u0111enovi\u0107]], Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin, Dangi\u0107 and Jev\u0111evi\u0107.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=147}} In February, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 consulted with one of Dangi\u0107's supporters, [[Bo\u0161ko Todorovi\u0107]], who instructed him to negotiate with the new commander of the Italian [[Second Army (Italy)|Second Army]], [[Mario Roatta]], to arrange the withdrawal of NDH and German troops from eastern Bosnia, to be replaced by an exclusively Italian administration. Both Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Todorovi\u0107 impressed Dalmazzo with the influence they were able to exert over the eastern Bosnian Chetniks, but Todorovi\u0107 was killed by the Partisans in Herzegovina in late February. The influence Jev\u0111evi\u0107 had was demonstrated when Serb nationalist armed groups in the [[Gora\u017ede]] and [[Fo\u010da]] districts swung over to an anti-Partisan and pro-Italian attitude when they were informed of Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin's ties with VI Corps headquarters. The plans for Italian expansion into eastern Bosnia were later discussed between Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and NDH State Secretary [[Vjekoslav Vran\u010di\u0107]].{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=71\u201373}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|By April 1942, the Germans had become aware of these Italian-Chetnik plans and had arrested Dangi\u0107 during a visit to the [[Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia|German-occupied territory of Serbia]].{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=71\u201373}}}}\n\nDalmazzo urged Roatta to expand Italian links with Serb nationalist groups into an alliance with them. At this time, the Italians were looking for allies to restore order, fight the Partisans, and support their political claims to NDH territory, and were under the impression that the various Serb nationalist groups were far better organised than they actually were. For example, Roatta was under the impression that Jev\u0111evi\u0107 represented the Herzegovinian Chetniks, and that they were aligned with Dangi\u0107. In early March, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin suddenly told the Italians that they were effectively in control of a Chetnik movement, and were ready to collaborate with the Italians on the latter's terms. Jev\u0111evi\u0107 sent a message to Dalmazzo explaining that the Herzegovinian Chetniks wanted to avenge Todorovi\u0107 and were concentrating around [[Nevesinje]] ready to demonstrate their loyalty to the Italians. Despite their statements, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin faced significant difficulties; the Serb nationalist groups had yet to demonstrate their military value to the Italians, and not all of the armed groups even acknowledged their leadership.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=71\u201373}}\n\nIn the spring and summer of 1942, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin regularly toured villages in the Gora\u017ede, [[Kalinovik]] and Fo\u010da districts, encouraging the local civilians and Chetnik detachments to behave loyally towards the Italians.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=75}} The Italians were unable to gain German support for their plan to use Chetnik groups as [[auxiliaries]] during the joint Italian-German anti-Partisan [[Operation Trio]] in April\u2013May.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=73}} In May, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 met with German intelligence officers in [[Dubrovnik]] and was asked whether he would cooperate in the pacification of Bosnia.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=80}} Mihailovi\u0107 was aware of and condoned the collaborationist arrangements entered into by Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=148}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin frequently met with Chetnik commander [[Mom\u010dilo \u0110uji\u0107]] in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], and the three men quarrelled over how to divide the financial assistance they were receiving from the Italians.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 19 April 1950}}\n[[File:Axis occupation of Yugoslavia 1941-43.png|thumb|Map showing the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia from 1941\u201343, including the demarcation line between the German and Italian zones|alt=map showing the partition of Yugoslavia, 1941\u201343]]\nIn an internal Chetnik report of June 1942, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 claimed that the Partisan proletarian brigades contained many \"Jews, Gypsies and Muslims\". In July 1942, he issued a proclamation to the \"Serbs of eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina\" claiming that:{{sfn|Hoare|2006|pp=159\u2013160}}\n\n{{quote|Tito, the supreme military chief of the Partisans, is a Croat from Zagreb. Pijade, the supreme political chief of the Partisans, is a Jew. Four-fifths of all armed Partisans were supplied to them by Paveli\u0107's Croatian Army. Two-thirds of their officers are former Croatian officers. The financing of their movement is carried out by the powerful Croatian capitalists of Zagreb, Split, Sarajevo and Dubrovnik. Fifty percent of the Usta\u0161e responsible for the massacres of Serbs are now in their ranks.}}\n\nJev\u0111evi\u0107 charged the Partisans with having \"destroyed Serb churches and established [[mosque]]s, [[synagogue]]s and Catholic temples\".{{sfn|Hoare|2006|pp=159\u2013160}} In mid-1942, the Chetniks became aware that the Italians were planning to largely withdraw from significant parts of the NDH that they had been occupying in force up to that time. Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin told the Italians that in response to this, Mihailovi\u0107 was considering evacuating Serb civilians from Herzegovina to Montenegro and moving Montenegrin Chetniks north to meet the [[Usta\u0161e]], who were expected to unleash a new wave of violence on Serb civilians.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=95}} Over 22\u201323 July 1942, Mihailovi\u0107 chaired a conference with Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin in [[Avtovac]], Herzegovina. On the second day of the conference, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin traveled to nearby [[Trebinje]] where they conferred with Herzegovinian Chetnik leaders [[Radmilo Gr\u0111i\u0107]] and [[Milan \u0160anti\u0107]]. The German consulate in Sarajevo reported that this meeting established the ultimate goals and immediate strategy of the Herzegovinian Chetniks as:{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=94\u201395}}\n\n{{quote\n|(1) the creation of [[Greater Serbia]]; (2) the destruction of the Partisans; (3) the removal of the Catholics and Muslims; (4) non-recognition of Croatia; (5) no collaboration with the Germans; and (6) temporary collaboration with the Italians for weapons, ammunition and food.\n}}\n\nUnder the auspices of the Italians, the Chetniks thoroughly [[ethnically cleansed]] eastern Herzegovina of its Croats and Muslims in July and August 1942.{{sfn|Goldstein 19 October 2012}} In response to a massacre of non-Serbs in Fo\u010da in August, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 issued a proclamation to the Muslims in eastern Herzegovina demanding that they join the Chetniks in their struggle against the Usta\u0161e. He stated: \"I personally believe that in a future state the Muslims have no other choice but to finally and definitely accept Serb nationality and renounce their speculative maneuvering between the Serb and Croat nations, above all because all the lands in which the Muslims live will indisputably and inviolably become part of the Serb state entity.\"{{sfn|Hoare|2013|p=48}} That month, Roatta contacted Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and \"legalised\" 3,000 of his Chetniks, formally authorising them to operate in eastern Herzegovina.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=148}}\n\nIn the autumn of 1942, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 took a radically different approach than other Chetnik leaders and spoke in favour of collaborating with the Muslims to form Muslim Chetnik units in the fight against the Usta\u0161e and the Partisans.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=308}} He favoured such tolerance in areas where the Muslims were protected by the Germans,{{sfn|Red\u017ei\u0107|2005|p=174}} and considered it a tactical necessity while stressing that \"there can be no true unity with them\".{{sfn|Malcolm|1996|p=187}} In late September or early October 1942, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Chetnik commander [[Petar Ba\u0107ovi\u0107]] held talks with Muslim leader [[Ismet Popovac]] and agreed to form a Muslim Chetnik organisation.{{sfn|Hoare|2013|p=49}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 then urged the Italian military to occupy all of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to end Usta\u0161e rule and claimed the support of 80 percent of the population, consisting of Serbs and Muslims. At the same time, he requested that the Germans grant autonomy to Bosnia and Herzegovina until the end of the war, citing that the Muslims were \"tested friends of the Germans both in the earlier and in the present era\". Although Jev\u0111evi\u0107 attempted to recruit Muslims while making use of the Bosnian desire for autonomy to support his alliance with the occupying Axis powers, nothing developed from these requests.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=308}}\n\n===Operation Alfa===\n{{main|Operation Alfa}}\nTowards the end of August 1942, Mihailovi\u0107 issued directives to Chetnik units, including those operating in the NDH such as Jev\u0111evi\u0107's forces, ordering them to prepare for a large scale anti-Partisan operation alongside Italian and NDH troops.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=97}} In September 1942, aware that they were unable to defeat the Partisans alone, the Chetniks tried to persuade the Italians to undertake a large operation against the Partisans in western Bosnia. Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin met with Roatta on 10 and 21 September and urged him to undertake this operation as soon as possible to clear the Partisans from the [[Prozor-Rama|Prozor]]\u2013[[Livno]] area and offered 7,500 Chetniks as aid on the condition they be given the necessary arms and supplies. He was successful in obtaining some arms and promises of action.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=232\u2013233}} The proposed operation, faced with opposition from Usta\u0161e leader [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] and a cautious Italian high command, was nearly cancelled, but after Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin promised to cooperate with Croat and Muslim anti-Partisan units, it went ahead, with less Chetnik involvement.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=97\u2013100}}\n\nIn early October 1942, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Ba\u0107ovi\u0107, with 3,000 Chetniks from Herzegovina and southeast Bosnia, participated in the Italian-led [[Operation Alfa]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=232\u2013233}} This involved a two-pronged thrust towards the town of Prozor. German and NDH troops drove from the north, and Italian and Chetnik forces pushed from the [[Neretva]] River.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=100}} Prozor and some smaller towns were captured by the combined Italian\u2013Chetnik force. Individual Chetnik bands, acting on their own, proceeded to burn a number of Muslim and Catholic villages, and killed between 543 and 2,500 non-Serbs in the Prozor area.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=232\u2013233}}{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=100}}{{sfn|Dedijer|Mileti\u0107|1990|p=581}}{{sfn|Goldstein 7 November 2012}} Their behaviour angered the NDH government and the Italians had to order the Chetniks to withdraw. Some were discharged altogether while others were sent to northern [[Dalmatia]] to aid \u0110uji\u0107's forces.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=232\u2013233}} A month after the massacre, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and Ba\u0107ovi\u0107 wrote a self-critical report on Prozor to Mihailovi\u0107, hoping to distance themselves from the actions of the troops.{{sfn|Goldstein 7 November 2012}}\n\n===Case White===\n{{main|Case White}}\n[[File:Jevdjevic and Italians.jpg|Jev\u0111evi\u0107 conferring with Italian officers in February 1943|thumb|left|alt=A tall male Chetnik amongst a group of men dressed in Italian Army uniform]]\nIn a meeting with Roatta in November 1942, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 obtained Italian agreement to \"legalise\" another 3,000 Chetniks and recognition of almost all of eastern Herzegovina as a \"Chetnik zone\". In return, the Chetniks had to promise not to attack Muslim and Croat civilians and agreed to having an Italian liaison officer embedded in all their formations of regiment strength or more. On 15 November 1942, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 agreed to support the Italian decision to start arming Muslim anti-Partisan groups. This support almost cost him his life when several Chetniks, who strongly opposed the arming of Croat and Muslim anti-Partisan groups by the Italians, visited [[Mostar]] with the intention of assassinating him.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|pp=106\u201308}}\n\nBy the end of 1942, Chetnik\u2013Italian collaboration was routine.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=148}} Chetnik forces were included in the Italian planning for [[Case White]], a major Axis anti-Partisan offensive which was to be launched on 20 January 1943. On 3 January, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 participated in an Axis planning conference for Case White in [[Rome]], along with senior German, Italian and NDH commanders.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|pp=103\u201304}} The plans included the 12,000 Chetniks under Jev\u0111evi\u0107's command,{{sfn|Red\u017ei\u0107|2005|p=36}} and on 23 February 1943 he concluded an agreement with the Germans that they would not cross the Neretva River and that contact between German and Chetnik troops would be avoided.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=241}} Early in the operation, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 concluded an agreement for cooperation with the commander of NDH troops in Mostar.{{sfn|Red\u017ei\u0107|2005|p=99}} Later in the operation Jev\u0111evi\u0107 requested, through the Italians, the assistance of the [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen]] in defending Nevesinje, which faced severe pressure from Partisan forces that had broken through the Chetnik lines at the Battle of the Neretva River. Although the Italians also made this request themselves, the Germans declined, stating that the division was reserved for other tasks.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=248}}\n\nAfter the death of Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin in February 1943, Jev\u0111evi\u0107, along with \u0110uji\u0107, Ba\u0107ovi\u0107, and [[Radovan Ivani\u0161evi\u0107]], vowed to the Italians to carry on Trifunovi\u0107-Bir\u010danin's policies of closely collaborating with them against the Partisans. The Italians were able to exert pressure on Jev\u0111evi\u0107, as his brother and fianc\u00e9e were interned in Italy.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=218}} Mihailovi\u0107 apparently felt that Jev\u0111evi\u0107 had exceeded his authority by attending the Case White planning conference in Rome, and indeed, when the Yugoslav government-in-exile awarded Jev\u0111evi\u0107 the [[Order of Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star]] in early 1943 for his services to the Serb population during the Usta\u0161e massacres of 1941, Mihailovi\u0107 suppressed the announcement of the award because of the nature of Jev\u0111evi\u0107's agreement with the Italians, although the reason may also have been because he was aware of Chetnik revenge killings of Herzegovinian Catholics and Muslims in response to atrocities committed by the Usta\u0161e in Croatia.{{sfn|Roberts|1973|p=68}} Tensions between Mihailovi\u0107 and Jev\u0111evi\u0107 became so apparent that Mihailovi\u0107 reportedly threatened to \"string [him] up from the nearest tree\".{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2007|p=125}} In March, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 publicly demanded an end to the Chetnik killing of Croats in Herzegovina.{{sfn|Red\u017ei\u0107|2005|p=146}} In May, [[Benito Mussolini]] finally gave in to German pressure and ordered Italian troops to co-operate in the disarming of Chetnik groups. Jev\u0111evi\u0107 was immediately placed under house arrest.{{sfn|Milazzo|1975|p=148}}\n\nHis house arrest did not last long, as in the following month, Mihailovi\u0107 sent Jev\u0111evi\u0107 to Slovenia to report on the state of Chetnik forces there.{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|p=172}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 began developing contacts with the Germans prior to the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Italian capitulation]] in September 1943.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=146}} On 3 September, he travelled to Rome via [[Rijeka]] and made contact with German intelligence services.{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|p=172}} This marked the beginning of his collaboration with the Germans.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=428}} Following the German occupation of NDH territory that had previously been held by the Italians, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 moved to Trieste and stayed at the Hotel Continental.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} There, he helped organise displaced Chetniks and arranged for them to be returned to the town of [[Opatija]].{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|p=172}} He stayed in Trieste until January 1944,{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} when he relocated to Opatija with Chetniks from Trieste who had been placed under his command. He then moved his Chetniks to [[Ilirska Bistrica]],{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|p=172}} and collaborated with the Germans until the end of the war.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=428}}\n\n===Withdrawal===\nIn December 1944, Jev\u0111evi\u0107's 3,000 remaining fighters{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=442}} joined \u0110uji\u0107's Chetniks, [[Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107]]'s [[Serbian Volunteer Corps (World War II)|Serbian Volunteer Corps]], and the remnants of [[Milan Nedi\u0107]]'s [[Serbian State Guard|Serbian Shock Corps]], which were under the command of  ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer|SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer und General der Waffen-SS]]'' (SS General) [[Odilo Globocnik]], the [[Higher SS and Police Leader]] of the [[Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral|Adriatic Littoral]].{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=449}} Despite this, they attempted to contact the western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in Italy in an effort to secure foreign aid for a proposed anti-communist offensive to restore royalist Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1969|p=111}} They were all blessed by Serbian Orthodox bishop [[Nikolaj Velimirovi\u0107]] upon his arrival in Slovenia.{{sfn|Byford|2004|p=11}}{{sfn|Cohen|1996|p=60}} On 11 April 1945, a detachment of Jev\u0111evi\u0107's Chetniks, along with three regiments of the Serbian Volunteer Corps, marched into south-western Croatia with the aim of linking up with the [[Montenegrin Volunteer Corps]] of [[Pavle \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107]], which was marching across Bosnia in an attempt to reach Slovenia. The relief effort came too late, because the Montenegrin Volunteer Corps had already been defeated by NDH forces at the [[Battle of Lijev\u010de Field]] near [[Banja Luka]], after which \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107 was captured and killed. The relief force then marched north to Slovenia, where it fought the Partisans before retreating into Austria. These Chetniks were subsequently captured by the Allies and [[Bleiburg repatriations|repatriated to Yugoslavia]], where they were summarily executed by the Partisans.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=449}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 remained highly influential among the Chetniks until the end of the war.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=158}}\n\n==Exile and death==\n\n===Release from captivity===\nIn the spring of 1945, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 fled to Italy, where he was arrested by Allied forces and detained at a camp in [[Grottaglie]].{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|pp=172\u2013173}} An estimated 10,000 Chetniks reportedly followed him and \u0110uji\u0107 into the country.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 was interned in Grottaglie for some time along with others, including the former Usta\u0161e commissioner for Banja Luka, [[Viktor Guti\u0107]].{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|pp=172\u2013173}} During this time, an indictment was issued against him in Sarajevo. It charged that under his command in \"the first half of October 1942 in and around Prozor [the Italians and Chetniks] butchered and killed 1,716 persons of both sexes, of the Croatian and Muslim nations, and plundered and burnt about 500 households\".{{sfn|Goldstein 7 November 2012}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 received considerable Allied support in Italy despite being wanted by British authorities in connection with these allegations.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} On paper, the Chetniks in Italy were listed as \"surrendered enemy personnel\", but were largely viewed with sympathy by the Allies, who considered them anti-German. Hence, many Chetnik prisoners were handed British Army uniforms and given non-combatant duties throughout Italy, such as guarding munitions and supplies.{{sfn|Judah|2000|p=124}} In August 1945, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 became the commander of a camp for disarmed Chetniks in [[Cesena]].{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} He was eventually set free and Yugoslavia's requests for extradition were ignored.{{sfn|Goldstein 7 November 2012}}\n\n===Intelligence-gathering activities===\n[[File:Dobroslav Jev\u0111evi\u0107 CIA intelligence chart.png|thumb|220px|A [[Central Intelligence Agency]] chart illustrating the flow of the information generated by Jev\u0111evi\u0107.]]\nAccording to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), Jev\u0111evi\u0107 lived in Rome under the aliases \"Giovanni St. Angelo\"{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} and \"Enrico Serrao\".{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency February 1952}} He spent most of his time and money quarrelling with \u00e9migr\u00e9 Yugoslav politicians, trying to prove that his collaboration with the Italians was necessary in order to protect the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the Partisans and Germans.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} He became a member of the Association of Free Journalists of Central-Eastern Europe, and served as an informant for the Italian intelligence services between 1946 and 1947. During this period, he published a confidential periodical called the ''Royal Yugoslav Intelligence Bulletin'' which he shared with the Italians. Jev\u0111evi\u0107 also contributed to a number of newspapers, including the Serb nationalist ''Srbobran''. In 1946, he helped form the Serbian National Committee in Rome and, with help from Achille Marazza, published a pan-Serb and anti-Croat newspaper, ''Srpske Novine'', in [[Eboli]]. He also established contacts with Italian neo-fascist groups and with an anti-communist group called the Committee of Nations Oppressed by Russia.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency February 1952}}\n\nDisagreement over who would lead the 10,000 Chetnik exiles in Italy escalated into a feud between Jev\u0111evi\u0107, \u0110uji\u0107 and General Miodrag Damjanovi\u0107 in mid-1947.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} Damjanovi\u0107 had been appointed by Mihailovi\u0107 in March 1945 to lead the Chetniks into northwestern Italy.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=191}} Jev\u0111evi\u0107 and \u0110uji\u0107 refused to accept this and claimed that they were Mihailovi\u0107's only successors as leaders of the Chetnik movement.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}}\n\nBy 1949, the CIA claimed that Jev\u0111evi\u0107's intelligence material was being used by the [[Italian Ministry of Interior]], the [[Counterintelligence Corps (United States Army)|United States Counterintelligence Corps]], [[Forensic Science Service|British Forensic Science Service]] in Trieste, and French intelligence services in Rome and [[Paris]]. His intelligence correspondents included \u0110uji\u0107, who disseminated his intelligence reports to the CIA, [[Konstantin Foti\u0107]], the former Yugoslav ambassador to the [[United States]], and [[Miro Didek]], Croat politician [[Vladko Ma\u010dek]]'s self-styled intelligence representative in Rome. The intelligence reports were mostly collected from refugees fleeing Yugoslavia and arriving in Italy via Trieste and from \u00e9migr\u00e9 groups in Italy and Greece. By 1949, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 claimed to have formed a large network of anti-communist propagandists in Italy and intelligence collection centres in Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. The CIA believed that these claims were exaggerated, if not entirely fictitious.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency February 1952}} In 1951, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 began printing an anti-communist, pro-Chetnik publication from an unidentified religious institution in Italy. Issues were regularly mailed to Yugoslav exiles and former Chetniks living in the United States, [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and various European countries.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}}\n\nIn May and June 1952, Jev\u0111evi\u0107 visited Canada and addressed the Congress of the Serbian National Defence (''Srpska Narodna Odbrana'') in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] regarding developments within Italy's Serb \u00e9migr\u00e9 community. The following year, he and \u0110uji\u0107 issued a proclamation in [[Chicago]] declaring their intention to organise Chetnik groups against Damjanovi\u0107, who had since emigrated to Germany. Jev\u0111evi\u0107 later received threatening letters warning him not to go through with such a plan for fear of disuniting the Yugoslav diaspora. Little is known of his activities after 1953.{{sfn|Central Intelligence Agency 16 June 1955}} He continued to live in Rome until his death in October 1962.{{sfn|Dizdar|1997|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n;Books\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book \n  | last = Cohen \n  | first = Philip J.\n  | authorlink = Philip J.
