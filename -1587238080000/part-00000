From November 1963 to January 1964, Buhari attended the Platoon Commanders' Course at the Nigerian Military Training College, [[Kaduna]]. In 1964, he facilitated his military training by attending the Mechanical Transport Officer's Course at the Army Mechanical Transport School in Borden, [[United Kingdom]]. From 1965 to 1967, Buhari served as commander of the Second Infantry Battalion and appointed [[brigade major]], Second Sector, First Infantry Division, April 1967 to July 1967.\n\n=== Civil war ===\nBuhari was assigned to the [[1st Division (Nigeria)|1st Division]] under the command of Lt.

However, before the move to Enugu, he was posted to Nsukka as Brigade Major of the 3rd Infantry Brigade under Joshua Gin who would later become battle fatigued and replaced by Isa Bukar.{{sfn|Momoh|2000|p=340}} Buhari stayed with the infantry for a few months as the Nigerian army began to adjust tactics learnt from early battle experiences. Instead of swift advances, the new tactics involved securing and holding on to the lines of communications and using captured towns as training ground to train new recruits brought in from the army depots in [[Abeokuta]] and Zaria.{{sfn|Momoh|2000|p=340}} In 1968, he was posted to the 4 Sector also called the Awka sector which was charged to take over the capture of Onitsha from Division 2.

''Nigeria: current issues and historical background.'' p. 121.</ref> With the successful execution of the coup by General Buhari, [[Tunde Idiagbon]] was appointed Chief of General Staff (the de facto No. 2 in the administration). The coup ended Nigeria's short-lived [[Second Nigerian Republic|Second Republic]], a period of multi-party [[democracy]] started in 1979.\n\nAccording to ''The New York Times'', the officers who took power argued that \"a flawed democracy was worse than no democracy at all\". Buhari justified the military's seizure of power by castigating the civilian government as hopelessly corrupt and promptly suspended the [[Constitution of Nigeria|constitution]]. Another rationale for the coup was to correct economic decline in Nigeria. Sani Abacha in the military's first broadcast after the coup linked ' an inept and corrupt leadership'{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=149}} with general economic decline. In Buhari's New Year day speech, he too mentioned the corrupt class of the [[Second Nigerian Republic|Second Republic]] but also as the cause of a general decline in morality in the society.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=149}}\n\n=== Consolidation of power ===\nThe structure of the new military leadership which was also the fifth in Nigeria since independence resembled the last military regime, the Obasanjo/Yaradua administration. The new regime established a Supreme Military Council, a Federal Executive Council and a Council of States.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=150}} The number of ministries was trimmed to 18 while the administration carried out a retrenchment exercise among the senior ranks of the civil service and police. It retired 17 permanent secretaries and some senior police and naval officers. In addition, the new military administration promulgated new laws to achieve its aim. These laws included the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Decree for the prosecution of armed robbery cases, the State Security (Detention of Person) Decree which gave powers to the military to detain individuals suspected of jeopardizing state security or causing economic adversity.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=153}} Other decrees included the Civil Service Commission and Public Offenders Decree which constituted the legal and administrative basis to conduct a purge in the civil service.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=153}}\n\nAccording to Decree Number 2 of 1984, the state security and the chief of staff were given the power to detain, without charges, individuals deemed to be a security risk to the state for up to three months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ab5d3c.html|title=Nigeria: Repeal of Decree 2|date=1 October 1998|website=refworld.org|publisher=|accessdate=}}</ref> Strikes and popular demonstrations were banned and Nigeria's security agency, the [[National Security Organization]] (NSO) was entrusted with unprecedented powers.

From November 1963 to January 1964, Buhari attended the Platoon Commanders' Course at the Nigerian Military Training College, [[Kaduna]]. In 1964, he facilitated his military training by attending the Mechanical Transport Officer's Course at the Army Mechanical Transport School in Borden, [[United Kingdom]]. From 1965 to 1967, Buhari served as commander of the Second Infantry Battalion and appointed [[brigade major]], Second Sector, First Infantry Division, April 1967 to July 1967.\n\n=== Civil war ===\nBuhari was assigned to the [[1st Division (Nigeria)|1st Division]] under the command of Lt.

However, before the move to Enugu, he was posted to Nsukka as Brigade Major of the 3rd Infantry Brigade under Joshua Gin who would later become battle fatigued and replaced by Isa Bukar.{{sfn|Momoh|2000|p=340}} Buhari stayed with the infantry for a few months as the Nigerian army began to adjust tactics learnt from early battle experiences. Instead of swift advances, the new tactics involved securing and holding on to the lines of communications and using captured towns as training ground to train new recruits brought in from the army depots in [[Abeokuta]] and Zaria.{{sfn|Momoh|2000|p=340}} In 1968, he was posted to the 4 Sector also called the Awka sector which was charged to take over the capture of Onitsha from Division 2.

''Nigeria: current issues and historical background.'' p. 121.</ref> With the successful execution of the coup by General Buhari, [[Tunde Idiagbon]] was appointed Chief of General Staff (the de facto No. 2 in the administration). The coup ended Nigeria's short-lived [[Second Nigerian Republic|Second Republic]], a period of multi-party [[democracy]] started in 1979.\n\nAccording to ''The New York Times'', the officers who took power argued that \"a flawed democracy was worse than no democracy at all\". Buhari justified the military's seizure of power by castigating the civilian government as hopelessly corrupt and promptly suspended the [[Constitution of Nigeria|constitution]]. Another rationale for the coup was to correct economic decline in Nigeria. Sani Abacha in the military's first broadcast after the coup linked ' an inept and corrupt leadership'{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=149}} with general economic decline. In Buhari's New Year day speech, he too mentioned the corrupt class of the [[Second Nigerian Republic|Second Republic]] but also as the cause of a general decline in morality in the society.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=149}}\n\n=== Consolidation of power ===\nThe structure of the new military leadership which was also the fifth in Nigeria since independence resembled the last military regime, the Obasanjo/Yaradua administration. The new regime established a Supreme Military Council, a Federal Executive Council and a Council of States.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=150}} The number of ministries was trimmed to 18 while the administration carried out a retrenchment exercise among the senior ranks of the civil service and police. It retired 17 permanent secretaries and some senior police and naval officers. In addition, the new military administration promulgated new laws to achieve its aim. These laws included the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Decree for the prosecution of armed robbery cases, the State Security (Detention of Person) Decree which gave powers to the military to detain individuals suspected of jeopardizing state security or causing economic adversity.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=153}} Other decrees included the Civil Service Commission and Public Offenders Decree which constituted the legal and administrative basis to conduct a purge in the civil service.{{sfn|Graf|1988|p=153}}\n\nAccording to Decree Number 2 of 1984, the state security and the chief of staff were given the power to detain, without charges, individuals deemed to be a security risk to the state for up to three months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6ab5d3c.html|title=Nigeria: Repeal of Decree 2|date=1 October 1998|website=refworld.org|publisher=|accessdate=}}</ref> Strikes and popular demonstrations were banned and Nigeria's security agency, the [[National Security Organization]] (NSO) was entrusted with unprecedented powers.

In 1922, a meeting (slet) of [[Sokol]], an important [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] movement and sport organisation in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], took place in [[Ljubljana]], where [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] and [[Serbia]]n Scouts also attended. Scouting was officially established in Slovenia in October 1922, and soon a large number of Scout groups in Slovenia contributed to the establishment of the common Scout Region (named \u017dupa) for [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]], founded in [[Osijek]]. The Slovenian own Scout Region was established in early 1923 at [[Ljubljana]]. The first Slovene Scout and Guide camp was organized during the summer of 1923<ref>{{cite book |first=Gra\u0161i\u010d |last=Miroslava |year=1990 |title=Skavti in gozdovniki na Slovenskem |trans-title=Scouts and Woodcrafts in Slovenia |place=Maribor |publisher=Muzej narodne osvoboditve Maribor |page=13}}</ref> at [[Kamni\u0161ka Bistrica]]. \n[[File:Pavle Kunaver.jpg|thumb|150px|Pre-war Slovenian Scout Pavel Kunaver (1889-1988)]]\nScouting in Slovenia was officially dissolved on June 10, 1941 because of [[World War II]].

The Scouting was organized among the Slovene ethnic groups in neighboring countries: The Slovene Carinthian Scouts organisation (1957) in [[Austria]] (today part of the [[Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnen \u00d6sterreichs]]); the Slovene Scouts of Trieste (Slovenska Zamejska Skavtska Organizacija) (1951 at [[Trieste]]) for boys and in 1958 for girls; and the Slovene Scouts of [[Gorizia]] (SZSO - Slovenski gori\u0161ki skavti) (1963) for girls and 1964 for boys as well.\n\n==ZSKSS establishment==\nIn 1984, a secondary school [[student]] from Ljubljana, '''Peter Lov\u0161in''', became acquainted with the Scout Movement. He decided to begin apolitical Scouting in [[Ljubljana]]. In the summer of 1985 he went to camp with Scouts from [[Gorizia]], and in 1986 he made the Scout Promise as one of their rank. In the same year he gathered a group of young people around him in one of the Catholic [[parish]]es of Ljubljana, with assistance from slovene Scouts from [[Trieste]] and [[Gorizia]]. The group was growing and in autumn 1988 was moved to another parish of Ljubljana. During the [[Saint George]] feast of 1989, 12 boys and girls made the Scout Promise, and by 1990, there were 21 Girl Guides and 18 Boy Scouts. The Catholic Scout Movement began to spread all over [[Slovenia]]. On March 31, 1990, the Zdru\u017eenje slovenskih katoli\u0161kih skavtinj in skavtov (ZSKSS) was established. The first legal Scout Promises were made by 29 Girl Guides and Boy Scouts, in a suburb of Ljubljana on May 20 of that year. Officially the ZSKSS was registered on Sunday, October 22, 1992.\n[[File:WSJ2007 Slovenian Scouts.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Slovene Scouts ([[Zveza tabornikov Slovenije|ZTS]] and ZSKSS) at 21st World Scout Jamboree ]]\n\n==International membership==\nIn 1996 ZSKSS was accepted as an associate member of [[WAGGGS]].
