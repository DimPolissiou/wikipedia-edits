A [[sequel]] to Konietzko and DiMartino's previous series ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'', which aired from 2005 to 2008, the series is animated in a style strongly influenced by [[anime]] with most of the animation being done by [[Studio Mir]] of South Korea and some by [[Pierrot (company)|Pierrot]] Co. of Japan.\n\nAs with its predecessor, the series is set in a [[fictional universe]] in which some people can manipulate, or \"bend\", the elements of water, earth, fire, or air. Only one person, the \"Avatar,\" can bend all four elements, and is responsible for maintaining balance in the world. The series follows Avatar [[Korra]], the female reincarnation of [[Aang]] from the previous series, as she faces political and spiritual unrest in a modernizing world.\n\nThe main characters are voiced by [[Janet Varney]], [[Seychelle Gabriel]], [[David Faustino]], [[P. J. Byrne]], [[J. K. Simmons]] and [[Mindy Sterling]], and supporting voice actors include [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[John Michael Higgins]], [[Lisa Edelstein]], [[Steve Blum]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Anne Heche]] and [[Zelda Williams]]. Several people involved in the creation of ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' (such as designer [[Joaquim Dos Santos]], writer Tim Hedrick and composers [[Jeremy Zuckerman]] and [[Benjamin Wynn]]) returned to work on ''The Legend of Korra''. \n''The Legend of Korra'' ran for 52 episodes, separated into <!--SEASON VS BOOK: Do not change \"seasons\" to \"books\"; currently, Nickelodeon refers to each \"book\" as a \"season\". See consensus at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Legend_of_Korra/Archive_2#Book_2_and_season_2 and en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Legend_of_Korra#Books_vs._Seasons -->four seasons (\"books\"). The series has been continued as a [[The Legend of Korra (comics)|comics series]].\n\nLike its predecessor, ''The Legend of Korra'' received critical acclaim, drawing favorable comparisons with the [[HBO]] series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' and the works of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]. It has been praised for its writing and production values. The series has been nominated for and won awards from the [[Annie Awards]], a [[Daytime Emmy Award]], and a [[Gracie Award]]. The series was also praised for addressing [[sociopolitical]] issues such as [[social unrest]] and [[terrorism]], as well as for going beyond the established boundaries of youth entertainment with respect to issues of [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]].\n\n==Series overview==\n{{main|List of The Legend of Korra episodes}}\n''The Legend of Korra'' was initially conceived as a twelve-episode [[miniseries]]. Nickelodeon declined the creators' [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for an ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' follow-up animated movie based on what then became the three-part comics ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 The Promise|The Promise]], [[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 The Search|The Search]]'' and ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 The Rift|The Rift]]'', choosing instead to expand ''Korra'' to 26 episodes.<ref>{{cite news|title='Avatar: The Search' was pitched as a movie by Mike DiMartino, but Nick opted for 'Korra' Book 2|url=http://www.hypable.com/2013/03/25/the-search-was-going-to-be-made-into-an-animated-movie-but-nickelodeon-went-with-book-2-of-the-legend-of-korra-instead/|accessdate=March 26, 2013|newspaper=Hypable|date=March 25, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514003635/http://www.hypable.com/2013/03/25/the-search-was-going-to-be-made-into-an-animated-movie-but-nickelodeon-went-with-book-2-of-the-legend-of-korra-instead/|archivedate=May 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The series was expanded further in July 2012 to 52 episodes. These episodes are grouped into four separate seasons (\"Books\") composed of twelve to fourteen episodes (\"Chapters\") each, with each season telling a stand-alone story. Beginning with episode 9 of season 3, new episodes were first distributed through the Internet rather than broadcast. ''The Legend of Korra'' concluded with the fourth season.<ref name=\"season2\">{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=Konietzko|title=I'm Sure This Meme Is Dead By Now But It Still|url=http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/27078349740/im-sure-this-meme-is-dead-by-now-but-it-still|date=July 12, 2012|accessdate=July 12, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716052845/http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/27078349740/im-sure-this-meme-is-dead-by-now-but-it-still|archivedate=July 16, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n<!--SEASON VS BOOK: Do not change \"seasons\" to \"books\"; currently, Nickelodeon refers to each \"book\" as a \"season\".

The people of the world belong to four nations: the Water Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation, and the Air Nomads.  The distinguishing element of the series is \"bending\", the ability of some people to [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]] manipulate the classical element associated with their nation ([[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], or [[Air (classical element)|air]]). Bending is carried out by spiritual and physical exercises, portrayed as similar to [[Chinese martial arts]]. As a result of a [[genocide]] in the series's [[backstory]], there is only one living family of airbenders at the time of the series.\n\nOnly one person, the \"[[Avatar]]\", can bend all four elements. Cyclically [[Reincarnation|reincarnating]] among the world's four nations, the Avatar maintains peace and balance in the world. ''The Legend of Korra'' focuses on Avatar [[Korra (The Legend of Korra)|Korra]], a seventeen-year-old girl from the Southern Water Tribe and the successor of Avatar [[Aang]] from ''The Last Airbender''.\n\nThe first season is mostly set in Republic City, the capital of the United Republic of Nations, a new multicultural sovereign state founded by Avatar Aang after the end of ''The Last Airbender''. The 1920s-inspired metropolis is described as \"if [[Manhattan]] had happened in Asia\" by the series' creators,<ref name=\"Korra Nation fan questions\">{{cite web|last1=Konietzko|first1=Bryan|last2=DiMartino|first2=Michael Dante|title=The Legend of Korra: All Answered Questions|url=http://korranation.tumblr.com/post/25669402658/hey-korra-nation-last-week-we-asked-you-to-post|work=Korra Nation|date=June 22, 2012|accessdate=June 30, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926150736/http://korranation.tumblr.com/post/25669402658/hey-korra-nation-last-week-we-asked-you-to-post|archivedate=September 26, 2013|df=mdy-all}} ([http://drawless.tumblr.com/post/25703110186/transcript-of-responses-to-fan-questions-about-the Transcript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926150624/http://drawless.tumblr.com/post/25703110186/transcript-of-responses-to-fan-questions-about-the |date=September 26, 2013 }})</ref> and its residents are united by their passion for \"pro-bending\", a spectator sport in which two teams composed of an earthbender, waterbender, and firebender throw each other out of a ring using bending techniques. Rapid technological growth has displaced the spirituality of bending, and what was considered a renowned martial art in ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' is now commonplace, with benders in Republic City using their abilities to commit crime, compete in spectator sports, and fulfill everyday jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://the-artifice.com/the-legend-of-korra-politics-privilege/|title=Politics and Privilege in The Legend of Korra|work=The Artifice|date=July 15, 2013|first=Kevin|last=Wong|access-date=March 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129004752/https://the-artifice.com/the-legend-of-korra-politics-privilege/#|archive-date=January 29, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The second season adds the southern polar region as a main setting in addition to Republic City, while the third and fourth seasons take place largely in the Earth Kingdom.\n\n===Synopsis===\nThe first season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 1)|Book One: Air]]'', sees Korra move to Republic City to learn airbending from [[Tenzin (The Legend of Korra)|Tenzin]], Avatar [[Aang]]'s son. She enters the pro-bending league, and befriends the brothers [[Bolin (The Legend of Korra)|Bolin]] and [[Mako (The Legend of Korra)|Mako]], as well as [[Asami Sato]], heiress to Future Industries, a leading engineering corporation. The ambitious politician Tarrlok enlists Korra to fight the anti-bender uprising of the \"Equalists\", led by the masked Amon, who strips benders of their abilities. Korra and her friends, aided by police chief Lin Beifong and United Forces General Iroh, unmask Amon as a bloodbender and Tarrlok's brother, ending the Equalists' coup. A spiritual meeting with her predecessor Aang allows Korra to realize her powers and to restore the bending abilities of Amon's victims.\n\nThe second season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 2)|Book Two: Spirits]]'', begins six months later, with dark spirits terrorizing the seas. Korra turns to her spirit-attuned uncle Unalaq, chief of the Northern Water Tribe, for tutelage, and opens the polar portals to the Spirit World at his direction. Unalaq then seizes power in the Southern Water Tribe by force, starting a civil war in which he is opposed by his brother, Korra's father, Tonraq. Seeking allies against Unalaq, Korra experiences the life of the first Avatar, Wan, who fused his soul with the spirit of light, Raava, to imprison her opponent, the spirit of darkness, Vaatu. Aided by his twin children Eska and Desna, Unalaq frees Vaatu during the Harmonic Convergence, a decamillennial alignment of planets, and unites with him to become a dark Avatar. During their fight, Unalaq/Vaatu pulls Raava out of Korra and destroys her, severing Korra's link to the previous Avatars; but with the help of Tenzin's daughter Jinora, she defeats Vaatu and Unalaq and revives Raava from within Vaatu. Korra then fuses with Raava again but the link to the previous Avatars has been permanently severed. Korra decides to leave the spirit portals open, allowing a new coexistence of spirits and humans.\n\nThe third season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 3)|Book Three: Change]]'', begins two weeks later with nonbenders all over the world obtaining airbending powers as a result of the Harmonic Convergence. As Tenzin, Korra, and her friends recruit them to re-establish the extinct Air Nomads, the newly airbending criminal [[Zaheer (The Legend of Korra)|Zaheer]] escapes his prison, frees his allies Ghazan, Ming-Hua, and P'Li, and attempts to kidnap the Avatar. This fails thanks to the help of Suyin Beifong, Lin's previously estranged sister. Zaheer and his team&nbsp;\u2013 members of the Red Lotus, an anarchic [[secret society]]&nbsp;\u2013 kill the Earth Queen, throwing her kingdom into chaos, and try to force Korra's surrender by taking the Air Nomads hostage. In the final confrontation, Zaheer's comrades are killed and he is defeated by a giant cyclone led by Jinora. Two weeks later, a weakened, wheelchair-bound Korra watches as Jinora is anointed an airbending master, and Tenzin rededicates the Air Nomads to service to the world.\n\nThe final season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 4)|Book Four: Balance]],'' is set three years later. Korra slowly recovers from the injuries incurred in the fight with Zaheer, traveling the world alone and haunted by fear. Meanwhile, Suyin's former head of security, Kuvira, reunites the fractured Earth Kingdom with the metalbenders loyal to her, and refuses to release power to the unpopular heir to the throne, Prince Wu. At the head of her new, totalitarian \"Earth Empire\", Kuvira seizes Suyin's city of Zaofu and sets her sights on the United Republic, which she claims for her nation. With [[Toph Beifong]]'s help, Korra frees herself of the remnants of Zaheer's poison, but after losing a duel to Kuvira at Zaofu, she allows Zaheer to help her overcome her fears and fully reconnect with her [[List of light deities|Avatar Spirit]], Raava. When Kuvira attacks Republic City with a giant [[mecha]] carrying a spirit-powered superweapon, it takes all the efforts of Korra and her friends, including the inventor Varrick and his assistant Zhu Li, to stop the colossus. Only after Korra saves her from the blast wave that Kuvira's weapon discharges when it's destroyed, blowing open a third portal to the Spirit World and destroying much of the city, does she concede defeat. The series ends with the prospect of democracy for the former Earth Kingdom, and with Korra and Asami leaving together for a vacation in the Spirit World.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=9 | Main cast\n|-\n| [[File:Janet Varney by Gage Skidmore.jpg|110x110px|Janet Varney]]\n| [[File:David Faustino by Gage Skidmore.jpg|110x110px|David Faustino]]\n| [[File:P.

The series mostly abstains from using the [[Anime#Attributes|visual tropes]] characteristic of anime, but does occasionally use exaggerated facial expressions to highlight emotions for comic effect.\n\nAs in ''Avatar'', the series adds to its Asian aesthetic by presenting all text that appears in its fictional world in [[traditional Chinese characters]], without translating it. For example, on the \"Wanted\" posters seen in the episode \"The Stakeout\", the names of the protagonists are written as \u5bc7\u62c9 (Korra), \u99ac\u9ad8 (Mako) and \u613d\u6797 (Bolin).\n\n===Music===\n''The Legend of Korra'' is set to music by [[Jeremy Zuckerman]], who previously wrote the music for ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' with [[Benjamin Wynn]].

A [[sequel]] to Konietzko and DiMartino's previous series ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'', which aired from 2005 to 2008, the series is animated in a style strongly influenced by [[anime]] with most of the animation being done by [[Studio Mir]] of South Korea and some by [[Pierrot (company)|Pierrot]] Co. of Japan.\n\nAs with its predecessor, the series is set in a [[fictional universe]] in which some people can manipulate, or \"bend\", the elements of water, earth, fire, or air. Only one person, the \"Avatar,\" can bend all four elements, and is responsible for maintaining balance in the world. The series follows Avatar [[Korra]], the female reincarnation of [[Aang]] from the previous series, as she faces political and spiritual unrest in a modernizing world.\n\nThe main characters are voiced by [[Janet Varney]], [[Seychelle Gabriel]], [[David Faustino]], [[P. J. Byrne]], [[J. K. Simmons]] and [[Mindy Sterling]], and supporting voice actors include [[Aubrey Plaza]], [[John Michael Higgins]], [[Lisa Edelstein]], [[Steve Blum]], [[Eva Marie Saint]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Anne Heche]] and [[Zelda Williams]]. Several people involved in the creation of ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' (such as designer [[Joaquim Dos Santos]], writer Tim Hedrick and composers [[Jeremy Zuckerman]] and [[Benjamin Wynn]]) returned to work on ''The Legend of Korra''. \n''The Legend of Korra'' ran for 52 episodes, separated into <!--SEASON VS BOOK: Do not change \"seasons\" to \"books\"; currently, Nickelodeon refers to each \"book\" as a \"season\". See consensus at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Legend_of_Korra/Archive_2#Book_2_and_season_2 and en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Legend_of_Korra#Books_vs._Seasons -->four seasons (\"books\"). The series has been continued as a [[The Legend of Korra (comics)|comics series]].\n\nLike its predecessor, ''The Legend of Korra'' received critical acclaim, drawing favorable comparisons with the [[HBO]] series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' and the works of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]. It has been praised for its writing and production values. The series has been nominated for and won awards from the [[Annie Awards]], a [[Daytime Emmy Award]], and a [[Gracie Award]]. The series was also praised for addressing [[sociopolitical]] issues such as [[social unrest]] and [[terrorism]], as well as for going beyond the established boundaries of youth entertainment with respect to issues of [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]].\n\n==Series overview==\n{{main|List of The Legend of Korra episodes}}\n''The Legend of Korra'' was initially conceived as a twelve-episode [[miniseries]]. Nickelodeon declined the creators' [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for an ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' follow-up animated movie based on what then became the three-part comics ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 The Promise|The Promise]], [[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 The Search|The Search]]'' and ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 The Rift|The Rift]]'', choosing instead to expand ''Korra'' to 26 episodes.<ref>{{cite news|title='Avatar: The Search' was pitched as a movie by Mike DiMartino, but Nick opted for 'Korra' Book 2|url=http://www.hypable.com/2013/03/25/the-search-was-going-to-be-made-into-an-animated-movie-but-nickelodeon-went-with-book-2-of-the-legend-of-korra-instead/|accessdate=March 26, 2013|newspaper=Hypable|date=March 25, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514003635/http://www.hypable.com/2013/03/25/the-search-was-going-to-be-made-into-an-animated-movie-but-nickelodeon-went-with-book-2-of-the-legend-of-korra-instead/|archivedate=May 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The series was expanded further in July 2012 to 52 episodes. These episodes are grouped into four separate seasons (\"Books\") composed of twelve to fourteen episodes (\"Chapters\") each, with each season telling a stand-alone story. Beginning with episode 9 of season 3, new episodes were first distributed through the Internet rather than broadcast. ''The Legend of Korra'' concluded with the fourth season.<ref name=\"season2\">{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=Konietzko|title=I'm Sure This Meme Is Dead By Now But It Still|url=http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/27078349740/im-sure-this-meme-is-dead-by-now-but-it-still|date=July 12, 2012|accessdate=July 12, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716052845/http://bryankonietzko.tumblr.com/post/27078349740/im-sure-this-meme-is-dead-by-now-but-it-still|archivedate=July 16, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n<!--SEASON VS BOOK: Do not change \"seasons\" to \"books\"; currently, Nickelodeon refers to each \"book\" as a \"season\".

The people of the world belong to four nations: the Water Tribes, the Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation, and the Air Nomads.  The distinguishing element of the series is \"bending\", the ability of some people to [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]] manipulate the classical element associated with their nation ([[Water (classical element)|water]], [[Earth (classical element)|earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], or [[Air (classical element)|air]]). Bending is carried out by spiritual and physical exercises, portrayed as similar to [[Chinese martial arts]]. As a result of a [[genocide]] in the series's [[backstory]], there is only one living family of airbenders at the time of the series.\n\nOnly one person, the \"[[Avatar]]\", can bend all four elements. Cyclically [[Reincarnation|reincarnating]] among the world's four nations, the Avatar maintains peace and balance in the world. ''The Legend of Korra'' focuses on Avatar [[Korra (The Legend of Korra)|Korra]], a seventeen-year-old girl from the Southern Water Tribe and the successor of Avatar [[Aang]] from ''The Last Airbender''.\n\nThe first season is mostly set in Republic City, the capital of the United Republic of Nations, a new multicultural sovereign state founded by Avatar Aang after the end of ''The Last Airbender''. The 1920s-inspired metropolis is described as \"if [[Manhattan]] had happened in Asia\" by the series' creators,<ref name=\"Korra Nation fan questions\">{{cite web|last1=Konietzko|first1=Bryan|last2=DiMartino|first2=Michael Dante|title=The Legend of Korra: All Answered Questions|url=http://korranation.tumblr.com/post/25669402658/hey-korra-nation-last-week-we-asked-you-to-post|work=Korra Nation|date=June 22, 2012|accessdate=June 30, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926150736/http://korranation.tumblr.com/post/25669402658/hey-korra-nation-last-week-we-asked-you-to-post|archivedate=September 26, 2013|df=mdy-all}} ([http://drawless.tumblr.com/post/25703110186/transcript-of-responses-to-fan-questions-about-the Transcript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926150624/http://drawless.tumblr.com/post/25703110186/transcript-of-responses-to-fan-questions-about-the |date=September 26, 2013 }})</ref> and its residents are united by their passion for \"pro-bending\", a spectator sport in which two teams composed of an earthbender, waterbender, and firebender throw each other out of a ring using bending techniques. Rapid technological growth has displaced the spirituality of bending, and what was considered a renowned martial art in ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' is now commonplace, with benders in Republic City using their abilities to commit crime, compete in spectator sports, and fulfill everyday jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://the-artifice.com/the-legend-of-korra-politics-privilege/|title=Politics and Privilege in The Legend of Korra|work=The Artifice|date=July 15, 2013|first=Kevin|last=Wong|access-date=March 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129004752/https://the-artifice.com/the-legend-of-korra-politics-privilege/#|archive-date=January 29, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The second season adds the southern polar region as a main setting in addition to Republic City, while the third and fourth seasons take place largely in the Earth Kingdom.\n\n===Synopsis===\nThe first season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 1)|Book One: Air]]'', sees Korra move to Republic City to learn airbending from [[Tenzin (The Legend of Korra)|Tenzin]], Avatar [[Aang]]'s son. She enters the pro-bending league, and befriends the brothers [[Bolin (The Legend of Korra)|Bolin]] and [[Mako (The Legend of Korra)|Mako]], as well as [[Asami Sato]], heiress to Future Industries, a leading engineering corporation. The ambitious politician Tarrlok enlists Korra to fight the anti-bender uprising of the \"Equalists\", led by the masked Amon, who strips benders of their abilities. Korra and her friends, aided by police chief Lin Beifong and United Forces General Iroh, unmask Amon as a bloodbender and Tarrlok's brother, ending the Equalists' coup. A spiritual meeting with her predecessor Aang allows Korra to realize her powers and to restore the bending abilities of Amon's victims.\n\nThe second season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 2)|Book Two: Spirits]]'', begins six months later, with dark spirits terrorizing the seas. Korra turns to her spirit-attuned uncle Unalaq, chief of the Northern Water Tribe, for tutelage, and opens the polar portals to the Spirit World at his direction. Unalaq then seizes power in the Southern Water Tribe by force, starting a civil war in which he is opposed by his brother, Korra's father, Tonraq. Seeking allies against Unalaq, Korra experiences the life of the first Avatar, Wan, who fused his soul with the spirit of light, Raava, to imprison her opponent, the spirit of darkness, Vaatu. Aided by his twin children Eska and Desna, Unalaq frees Vaatu during the Harmonic Convergence, a decamillennial alignment of planets, and unites with him to become a dark Avatar. During their fight, Unalaq/Vaatu pulls Raava out of Korra and destroys her, severing Korra's link to the previous Avatars; but with the help of Tenzin's daughter Jinora, she defeats Vaatu and Unalaq and revives Raava from within Vaatu. Korra then fuses with Raava again but the link to the previous Avatars has been permanently severed. Korra decides to leave the spirit portals open, allowing a new coexistence of spirits and humans.\n\nThe third season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 3)|Book Three: Change]]'', begins two weeks later with nonbenders all over the world obtaining airbending powers as a result of the Harmonic Convergence. As Tenzin, Korra, and her friends recruit them to re-establish the extinct Air Nomads, the newly airbending criminal [[Zaheer (The Legend of Korra)|Zaheer]] escapes his prison, frees his allies Ghazan, Ming-Hua, and P'Li, and attempts to kidnap the Avatar. This fails thanks to the help of Suyin Beifong, Lin's previously estranged sister. Zaheer and his team&nbsp;\u2013 members of the Red Lotus, an anarchic [[secret society]]&nbsp;\u2013 kill the Earth Queen, throwing her kingdom into chaos, and try to force Korra's surrender by taking the Air Nomads hostage. In the final confrontation, Zaheer's comrades are killed and he is defeated by a giant cyclone led by Jinora. Two weeks later, a weakened, wheelchair-bound Korra watches as Jinora is anointed an airbending master, and Tenzin rededicates the Air Nomads to service to the world.\n\nThe final season, ''[[The Legend of Korra (season 4)|Book Four: Balance]],'' is set three years later. Korra slowly recovers from the injuries incurred in the fight with Zaheer, traveling the world alone and haunted by fear. Meanwhile, Suyin's former head of security, Kuvira, reunites the fractured Earth Kingdom with the metalbenders loyal to her, and refuses to release power to the unpopular heir to the throne, Prince Wu. At the head of her new, totalitarian \"Earth Empire\", Kuvira seizes Suyin's city of Zaofu and sets her sights on the United Republic, which she claims for her nation. With [[Toph Beifong]]'s help, Korra frees herself of the remnants of Zaheer's poison, but after losing a duel to Kuvira at Zaofu, she allows Zaheer to help her overcome her fears and fully reconnect with her [[List of light deities|Avatar Spirit]], Raava. When Kuvira attacks Republic City with a giant [[mecha]] carrying a spirit-powered superweapon, it takes all the efforts of Korra and her friends, including the inventor Varrick and his assistant Zhu Li, to stop the colossus. Only after Korra saves her from the blast wave that Kuvira's weapon discharges when it's destroyed, blowing open a third portal to the Spirit World and destroying much of the city, does she concede defeat. The series ends with the prospect of democracy for the former Earth Kingdom, and with Korra and Asami leaving together for a vacation in the Spirit World.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=9 | Main cast\n|-\n| [[File:Janet Varney by Gage Skidmore.jpg|110x110px|Janet Varney]]\n| [[File:David Faustino by Gage Skidmore.jpg|110x110px|David Faustino]]\n| [[File:P.

The series mostly abstains from using the [[Anime#Attributes|visual tropes]] characteristic of anime, but does occasionally use exaggerated facial expressions to highlight emotions for comic effect.\n\nAs in ''Avatar'', the series adds to its Asian aesthetic by presenting all text that appears in its fictional world in [[traditional Chinese characters]], without translating it. For example, on the \"Wanted\" posters seen in the episode \"The Stakeout\", the names of the protagonists are written as \u5bc7\u62c9 (Korra), \u99ac\u9ad8 (Mako) and \u613d\u6797 (Bolin).\n\n===Music===\n''The Legend of Korra'' is set to music by [[Jeremy Zuckerman]], who previously wrote the music for ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' with [[Benjamin Wynn]].

During her training she met Julie Mullard (1912 \u2013 2006), a fellow nurse with whom she established a lifelong romantic relationship.\n\nShe worked as a nurse while beginning a writing career, treating [[Dunkirk]] evacuees at the [[Winford#Winford Hospital|Winford Emergency Hospital]] in [[Bristol]], and working in Radcliffe Infirmary's brain surgery ward until 1945. She published her first novel, ''Purposes of Love'', in 1939: it has a contemporary setting, like her other early novels, and the novelist Linda Proud has described it as \"a strange combination of Platonism and hospital romance\".<ref name=\"hns\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.historicalnovelsociety.org/solander%20files/glimpse_of_a_strong_greek_light_.htm |title=The Glimpse of a Strong Greek Light |first=Linda |last=Proud |periodical=Historical Novel Society |year=1999 |accessdate=23 October 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927174301/http://www.historicalnovelsociety.org/solander%20files/glimpse_of_a_strong_greek_light_.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}</ref> Her novel ''The Friendly Young Ladies'' (1943), which is about a lesbian relationship between a writer and a nurse, seems to have been inspired by her own relationship with Mullard.\n\nIn 1948, after her novel ''Return to Night'' won an [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] prize worth $150,000, Renault and Mullard emigrated to South Africa, where they remained for the rest of their lives. There, according to Proud, they found a community of gay expatriates who had \"escaped the repressive attitudes towards homosexuality in Britain for the comparatively liberal atmosphere of [[Durban, South Africa|Durban]].... Mary and Julie found themselves able to set up home together in this new land without causing the outrage they had sometimes provoked at home.\"<ref name=\"hns\" /> However, both Renault and Mullard were critical of the less liberal aspects of their new home, and participated in the [[Black Sash]] movement against [[apartheid]] in the 1950s.\n\nShortly before her death, Mary was listed as one of the famous alumnae who had brought the Radcliffe Infirmary Nurses' Home much honour.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sweetman|first1=David|title=Mary Renault|date=1993|publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company|location=United States|page=307}}</ref> Due to the especially wet winter of 1983 in Cape Town, Mary picked up a small cough. At first, the cough was no more than a mild irritant for Mary, but it soon \"become a persistent, hacking attempt to clear her lungs and catch her breath.\" After Julie voiced her fears to their mutual friend Dr. Sonnenberg, x-rays were performed, and Mary was diagnosed with pneumonia and was directed to a nursing home. After failing to eliminate the pneumonia with antibiotics, a visiting British surgeon performed a bronchoscopy under general anaesthetic. Shortly after, the doctor revealed to Julie that he had \"found fluid on the lung and had aspirated some of it: the cause was cancer.\" Julie begged the doctors to say nothing to Mary unless she demanded to be told. By October, a friend of Dr. Sonnenberg, Dr. Slome, was draining off liquid twice a week and was convinced that there was a pocket he could not reach. Mary was then put on oxygen in order to ease her breathing. On 12 December 1983, as a last hope, the doctors decided to inject a new chemical into the pleura early the next morning, in the hope that it would stop further fluid from forming. Before the operation even began, Julie received a phone call, which she knew \"could only mean one thing\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sweetman|first1=David|title=Mary Renault|date=1993|publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company|location=United States|pages=301\u2013304}}</ref> Mary Renault died in Cape Town on 13 December 1983.\n\n==Themes==\nIn South Africa Renault was able to write forthrightly about homosexual relationships for the first time. Her sympathetic treatment of love between men won her a wide gay readership, but it also led to rumours that Renault was really a gay man writing under a female pseudonym. Renault found these rumours amusing but also sought to distance herself from being labelled a \"gay writer\".\n\nHer historical novels are all set in ancient Greece. They include a pair of novels about the mythological hero Theseus and a trilogy about the career of Alexander the Great. In a sense, ''The Charioteer'' (1953), the story of two young gay servicemen in the 1940s who try to model their relationship on the ideals expressed in Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' and ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', is a warm-up for Renault's historical novels. By turning away from the twentieth century and focusing on stories about male lovers in the warrior societies of ancient Greece, Renault no longer had to deal with homosexuality and anti-gay prejudice as social \"problems\".  Instead she was free to focus on larger ethical and philosophical concerns while examining the nature of love and leadership. ''The Charioteer'' could not be published in the US until 1959, which made it a somewhat later addition to homosexual literature in the United States because American readers and critics had accepted serious gay love stories in such works as [[Djuna Barnes]]' ''[[Nightwood]]'' (1936), [[Carson McCullers]]' ''[[Reflections in a Golden Eye (novel)|Reflections in a Golden Eye]]'' (1941), [[Truman Capote]]'s ''[[Other Voices, Other Rooms (novel)|Other Voices, Other Rooms]]'' (1948) and [[Gore Vidal]]'s ''[[The City and the Pillar]]'' (1948)<ref>{{Citation | last = Slide | first = Anthony | authorlink = Anthony Slide| year = 2003 | title = [[Lost Gay Novels]]: A Reference Guide to Fifty Works from the First Half of the Twentieth Century | publisher = Routledge | pages = 1\u20132}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough not a [[Classics|classicist]] by training, Renault was admired in her day for her scrupulous recreations of the ancient Greek world. Some of the history presented in her fiction and in her non-fiction work, ''The Nature of Alexander'' has been called into question, however. Her novels about Theseus rely on the controversial theories of [[Robert Graves]], and her portrait of Alexander has been criticized as uncritical and romanticized.<ref name=\"beyondrenault\">{{Cite web |title= Beyond Renault: Alexander the Great in Fiction |url= http://myweb.unomaha.edu/~mreames/Beyond_Renault/beyondrenault.html |accessdate= 23 October 2007 |first= Jeanne |last= Reames |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012035929/http://myweb.unomaha.edu/~mreames/Beyond_Renault/beyondrenault.html |archivedate= 12 October 2007 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>  According to [[Kevin Kopelson]], professor of English at the [[University of Iowa]], Renault \"mischaracterize[s] pederastic relationships as heroic.\"<ref>{{cite book| first = Kevin | last = Kopelson |title= Love's Litany: The Writing of Modern Homoerotics | publisher= Stanford University Press |year=1994| chapter = Introduction}}</ref>  Defying centuries of admiration for [[Demosthenes]] as a great [[orator]], Renault portrayed him as a cruel, corrupt and cowardly [[demagogue]]. Renault defended her interpretation of the available sources in author's notes attached to her books.\n\nThough Renault appreciated her gay following, she was uncomfortable with the \"[[gay pride]]\" movement that emerged in the 1970s after the [[Stonewall riots]].  Like Laurie Odell, the protagonist of ''The Charioteer'', she was suspicious of identifying oneself primarily by one's sexual orientation.

During her training she met Julie Mullard (1912 \u2013 2006), a fellow nurse with whom she established a lifelong romantic relationship.\n\nShe worked as a nurse while beginning a writing career, treating [[Dunkirk]] evacuees at the [[Winford#Winford Hospital|Winford Emergency Hospital]] in [[Bristol]], and working in Radcliffe Infirmary's brain surgery ward until 1945. She published her first novel, ''Purposes of Love'', in 1939: it has a contemporary setting, like her other early novels, and the novelist Linda Proud has described it as \"a strange combination of Platonism and hospital romance\".<ref name=\"hns\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.historicalnovelsociety.org/solander%20files/glimpse_of_a_strong_greek_light_.htm |title=The Glimpse of a Strong Greek Light |first=Linda |last=Proud |periodical=Historical Novel Society |year=1999 |accessdate=23 October 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927174301/http://www.historicalnovelsociety.org/solander%20files/glimpse_of_a_strong_greek_light_.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}</ref> Her novel ''The Friendly Young Ladies'' (1943), which is about a lesbian relationship between a writer and a nurse, seems to have been inspired by her own relationship with Mullard.\n\nIn 1948, after her novel ''Return to Night'' won an [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] prize worth $150,000, Renault and Mullard emigrated to South Africa, where they remained for the rest of their lives. There, according to Proud, they found a community of gay expatriates who had \"escaped the repressive attitudes towards homosexuality in Britain for the comparatively liberal atmosphere of [[Durban, South Africa|Durban]].... Mary and Julie found themselves able to set up home together in this new land without causing the outrage they had sometimes provoked at home.\"<ref name=\"hns\" /> However, both Renault and Mullard were critical of the less liberal aspects of their new home, and participated in the [[Black Sash]] movement against [[apartheid]] in the 1950s.\n\nShortly before her death, Mary was listed as one of the famous alumnae who had brought the Radcliffe Infirmary Nurses' Home much honour.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sweetman|first1=David|title=Mary Renault|date=1993|publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company|location=United States|page=307}}</ref> Due to the especially wet winter of 1983 in Cape Town, Mary picked up a small cough. At first, the cough was no more than a mild irritant for Mary, but it soon \"become a persistent, hacking attempt to clear her lungs and catch her breath.\" After Julie voiced her fears to their mutual friend Dr. Sonnenberg, x-rays were performed, and Mary was diagnosed with pneumonia and was directed to a nursing home. After failing to eliminate the pneumonia with antibiotics, a visiting British surgeon performed a bronchoscopy under general anaesthetic. Shortly after, the doctor revealed to Julie that he had \"found fluid on the lung and had aspirated some of it: the cause was cancer.\" Julie begged the doctors to say nothing to Mary unless she demanded to be told. By October, a friend of Dr. Sonnenberg, Dr. Slome, was draining off liquid twice a week and was convinced that there was a pocket he could not reach. Mary was then put on oxygen in order to ease her breathing. On 12 December 1983, as a last hope, the doctors decided to inject a new chemical into the pleura early the next morning, in the hope that it would stop further fluid from forming. Before the operation even began, Julie received a phone call, which she knew \"could only mean one thing\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sweetman|first1=David|title=Mary Renault|date=1993|publisher=Harcourt Brace & Company|location=United States|pages=301\u2013304}}</ref> Mary Renault died in Cape Town on 13 December 1983.\n\n==Themes==\nIn South Africa Renault was able to write forthrightly about homosexual relationships for the first time. Her sympathetic treatment of love between men won her a wide gay readership, but it also led to rumours that Renault was really a gay man writing under a female pseudonym. Renault found these rumours amusing but also sought to distance herself from being labelled a \"gay writer\".\n\nHer historical novels are all set in ancient Greece. They include a pair of novels about the mythological hero Theseus and a trilogy about the career of Alexander the Great. In a sense, ''The Charioteer'' (1953), the story of two young gay servicemen in the 1940s who try to model their relationship on the ideals expressed in Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' and ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', is a warm-up for Renault's historical novels. By turning away from the twentieth century and focusing on stories about male lovers in the warrior societies of ancient Greece, Renault no longer had to deal with homosexuality and anti-gay prejudice as social \"problems\".  Instead she was free to focus on larger ethical and philosophical concerns while examining the nature of love and leadership. ''The Charioteer'' could not be published in the US until 1959, which made it a somewhat later addition to homosexual literature in the United States because American readers and critics had accepted serious gay love stories in such works as [[Djuna Barnes]]' ''[[Nightwood]]'' (1936), [[Carson McCullers]]' ''[[Reflections in a Golden Eye (novel)|Reflections in a Golden Eye]]'' (1941), [[Truman Capote]]'s ''[[Other Voices, Other Rooms (novel)|Other Voices, Other Rooms]]'' (1948) and [[Gore Vidal]]'s ''[[The City and the Pillar]]'' (1948)<ref>{{Citation | last = Slide | first = Anthony | authorlink = Anthony Slide| year = 2003 | title = [[Lost Gay Novels]]: A Reference Guide to Fifty Works from the First Half of the Twentieth Century | publisher = Routledge | pages = 1\u20132}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough not a [[Classics|classicist]] by training, Renault was admired in her day for her scrupulous recreations of the ancient Greek world. Some of the history presented in her fiction and in her non-fiction work, ''The Nature of Alexander'' has been called into question, however. Her novels about Theseus rely on the controversial theories of [[Robert Graves]], and her portrait of Alexander has been criticized as uncritical and romanticized.<ref name=\"beyondrenault\">{{Cite web |title= Beyond Renault: Alexander the Great in Fiction |url= http://myweb.unomaha.edu/~mreames/Beyond_Renault/beyondrenault.html |accessdate= 23 October 2007 |first= Jeanne |last= Reames |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012035929/http://myweb.unomaha.edu/~mreames/Beyond_Renault/beyondrenault.html |archivedate= 12 October 2007 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>  According to [[Kevin Kopelson]], professor of English at the [[University of Iowa]], Renault \"mischaracterize[s] pederastic relationships as heroic.\"<ref>{{cite book| first = Kevin | last = Kopelson |title= Love's Litany: The Writing of Modern Homoerotics | publisher= Stanford University Press |year=1994| chapter = Introduction}}</ref>  Defying centuries of admiration for [[Demosthenes]] as a great [[orator]], Renault portrayed him as a cruel, corrupt and cowardly [[demagogue]]. Renault defended her interpretation of the available sources in author's notes attached to her books.\n\nThough Renault appreciated her gay following, she was uncomfortable with the \"[[gay pride]]\" movement that emerged in the 1970s after the [[Stonewall riots]].  Like Laurie Odell, the protagonist of ''The Charioteer'', she was suspicious of identifying oneself primarily by one's sexual orientation.

Shadforth envisioned the visual as a \"celebration of extraordinariness and difference\" populated by lizard people and set at an [[alternative universe]] [[truck stop]] where Garbage were the house band. Animated sequences would be cued to the guitar parts. The truck stop people would appear normal at first, but as they started to dance, hints of 'lizardness' would appear (flicking tongues, tails) with subtle [[prosthetics]]. The video would end with a [[hot rod race]] and a [[flying saucer]], with Manson climbing on-board or the side of one of the cars. The shots were to be stylized: colourful people, cars and clothes against a starry night sky. Inside the cars, the lizard people would reveal the full extent of their real selves in [[strobe light]] shots. Despite Shadforth's music video for [[Kylie Minogue]]'s \"[[Can't_Get_You_Out_of_My_Head#Music_video|Can't Get You Out of My Head]]\" then saturating music channels worldwide, Interscope chose to reject the treatment; \"I feel broken hearted we never made it\" Manson later recalled.<ref name=\"TITNTKMASM\">{{cite book| title=''[[This Is the Noise That Keeps Me Awake]]''|publisher=[[Akashic Books]]|year=2017|pages=129|chapter=The Great Lost \"Cherry Lips\" Video|author-link=[[Garbage (band)|Garbage]] |author-link2=Jason Cohen|isbn=978-1-61775-550-7}}</ref>\n\n===Joseph Kahn directed video===\n[[File:CherryLipsInvisibleBand.png|thumb|right|[[Garbage (band)|Garbage]] were digitally-removed from the \"Cherry Lips\" video to give the effect of invisibility.]]\n\nThe produced [[music video]] for \"Cherry Lips\" was [[music video director|directed]] by [[Joseph Kahn]] on a [[Sound stage|set]] installed in a [[loft]] located in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]]<ref name=\"InStylefeature\"/> on October 22, 2001.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Manson|first=Shirley|title=New York - October 22nd|journal=Garbage Tour Diaries|date=2001-10-22|url=http://www.garbage.com/news/journal.php?uid=237|accessdate=2011-07-25|quote=Video shoot for Cherry Lips with director Joseph Kahn.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019231645/http://www.garbage.com/news/journal.php?uid=237|archivedate=2006-10-19}}</ref> The video was produced by Supermega/Palomar; collaborating on the music video were top hair artist Renato Campura, make-up artist Mathu Andersen and stylist Kithe Brewster.<ref name=\"InStylefeature\"/> [[Visual effects]] were handled by [[Chris Watts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CHRIS WATTS; Visual Effects Supervisor|url=http://www.bake.org/resources/main/vfx_resume/chris_watts_resume_011409.pdf|publisher=Bake.org|accessdate=2011-07-25}}</ref>\n\nThe [[concept|video treatment]] Kahn filmed featured Garbage performing in a loft space, but only seen on [[mirror]] [[Mirror image|reflections]], on [[Display device|monitor displays]] or reflected in the [[camera lens]].

Shadforth envisioned the visual as a \"celebration of extraordinariness and difference\" populated by lizard people and set at an [[alternative universe]] [[truck stop]] where Garbage were the house band. Animated sequences would be cued to the guitar parts. The truck stop people would appear normal at first, but as they started to dance, hints of 'lizardness' would appear (flicking tongues, tails) with subtle [[prosthetics]]. The video would end with a [[hot rod race]] and a [[flying saucer]], with Manson climbing on-board or the side of one of the cars. The shots were to be stylized: colourful people, cars and clothes against a starry night sky. Inside the cars, the lizard people would reveal the full extent of their real selves in [[strobe light]] shots. Despite Shadforth's music video for [[Kylie Minogue]]'s \"[[Can't_Get_You_Out_of_My_Head#Music_video|Can't Get You Out of My Head]]\" then saturating music channels worldwide, Interscope chose to reject the treatment; \"I feel broken hearted we never made it\" Manson later recalled.<ref name=\"TITNTKMASM\">{{cite book| title=''[[This Is the Noise That Keeps Me Awake]]''|publisher=[[Akashic Books]]|year=2017|pages=129|chapter=The Great Lost \"Cherry Lips\" Video|author-link=[[Garbage (band)|Garbage]] |author-link2=Jason Cohen|isbn=978-1-61775-550-7}}</ref>\n\n===Joseph Kahn directed video===\n[[File:CherryLipsInvisibleBand.png|thumb|right|[[Garbage (band)|Garbage]] were digitally-removed from the \"Cherry Lips\" video to give the effect of invisibility.]]\n\nThe produced [[music video]] for \"Cherry Lips\" was [[music video director|directed]] by [[Joseph Kahn]] on a [[Sound stage|set]] installed in a [[loft]] located in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]]<ref name=\"InStylefeature\"/> on October 22, 2001.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Manson|first=Shirley|title=New York - October 22nd|journal=Garbage Tour Diaries|date=2001-10-22|url=http://www.garbage.com/news/journal.php?uid=237|accessdate=2011-07-25|quote=Video shoot for Cherry Lips with director Joseph Kahn.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019231645/http://www.garbage.com/news/journal.php?uid=237|archivedate=2006-10-19}}</ref> The video was produced by Supermega/Palomar; collaborating on the music video were top hair artist Renato Campura, make-up artist Mathu Andersen and stylist Kithe Brewster.<ref name=\"InStylefeature\"/> [[Visual effects]] were handled by [[Chris Watts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CHRIS WATTS; Visual Effects Supervisor|url=http://www.bake.org/resources/main/vfx_resume/chris_watts_resume_011409.pdf|publisher=Bake.org|accessdate=2011-07-25}}</ref>\n\nThe [[concept|video treatment]] Kahn filmed featured Garbage performing in a loft space, but only seen on [[mirror]] [[Mirror image|reflections]], on [[Display device|monitor displays]] or reflected in the [[camera lens]].

Flo's just got himself, and he can't make the verses more than throwaways or deliver a chorus that probably wouldn't even work without him. He doesn't have a sample, either, to steal the show.

The Leisure Plaza facility offered a leisure and retail complex to Milton Keynes: the location featured trees, shrubbery, family picnic areas and a large pond hosting wildlife and plants with a footbridge crossing the water.  In addition to the ice rink,  the new complex also featured Flamingo's nightclub, Megabowl 10-pin bowling alley, Cafe Moonshine (later Heroes sports bar),  an [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] superstore and [[Homebase]] centre.\n\nThe ice rink itself boasted 2,200 seats, 3 licensed bars (one overlooking the ice surface, the other a kiosk at ice level), a restaurant, 3 function rooms (2 of which overlooked the ice surface \u2013 one having a bar), an ice sports shop, cafeteria, video games area, skate hire, 8 team changing rooms (1 reserved for the home professional ice hockey team), DJ box, management offices and an [[Ice hockey rink#International|olympic sized ice pad]].{{cn|date=January 2013}} Its facilities and ice pad was one of several rinks which opened in the 1980s and '90s. In the early '90s two of Bladerunner's smaller changing rooms were converted into a large changing room, office and meeting area for the specific use of the Milton Keynes Kings Junior Ice Hockey Club.\n\n===1990\u201396===\n\nBladerunner would regularly sellout on Kings game nights and would often have to turn customers away due to the success of their public ice skating sessions. Other events included ice shows, figure skating competitions and concerts. On several occasions the [[Great Britain men's national ice hockey team]] used the arena for training camps and games and it was also used as the training base for Olympic champion figure skaters, [[Jane Torvill]] & [[Christopher Dean]].\n\nIn 1992 arena owners First Leisure closed the venue, however it was opened soon after following public outcry, including public rallies outside the offices of [[Milton Keynes Council]] and First Leisure. Public demand saw the ice rink re-open in time for the 1992/93 ice hockey season. However this was not the last time the ice rink would close its doors, a second short closing and re-opening in the early 1990s was followed by a permanent closure in 1996.\n\n===1996 closure===\n\nPublic protest and the popularity of the Kings ice hockey team were not enough to find a new owner for the ice rink and the doors became locked, apparently for good, in the summer of 1996. Users of the ice rink instead were forced to travel over an hour to ice rinks in Oxford, Stevenage, Peterborough and Haringey \u2013 including the MK Kings Junior Ice Hockey Club who re-located first to Stevenage and then to Haringey under the Milton Keynes name.\n\n===1998 re-opening===\n\nAfter two years of closure the arena re-opened under the new ownership in April 1998 and was renamed [[Planet Ice]], with the Kings ice hockey team being re-formed in the third tier of English ice hockey under the ownership of local businessman Mike Darnell. Popularity of the venue was just as high as when the venue first opened in 1990, with Planet Ice's learn to skate courses being over-subscribed for several years. The arena featured several changes when it was re-opened, including; large scale re-decoration, the ice sports shop in the arena concourse being bricked up, the alcohol kiosk at bar level converted into a store room, a new 'Skate Xpress' shop opening in the skate hire area of the building. Not all areas of the ice rink complex re-opened, including the restaurant which remained closed.\n\nIn addition to the [[Milton Keynes Kings|MK Kings]] re-formation, Planet Ice reached an agreement with [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] for their newly formed [[Ice Hockey Superleague|Superleague]] side [[London Knights (UK)|London Knights]] to use the arena as their training base. This saw the junior club's purpose built changing room converted into a luxury dressing room with a two of the smaller changing rooms converted into an office and gym, all for exclusive use by the Knights. Delays in the opening of the Knights new arena in London saw the team play several home games in Milton Keynes before they were finally able to host games at the [[London Arena]] whilst the team trained and lived in MK.

The Leisure Plaza facility offered a leisure and retail complex to Milton Keynes: the location featured trees, shrubbery, family picnic areas and a large pond hosting wildlife and plants with a footbridge crossing the water.  In addition to the ice rink,  the new complex also featured Flamingo's nightclub, Megabowl 10-pin bowling alley, Cafe Moonshine (later Heroes sports bar),  an [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] superstore and [[Homebase]] centre.\n\nThe ice rink itself boasted 2,200 seats, 3 licensed bars (one overlooking the ice surface, the other a kiosk at ice level), a restaurant, 3 function rooms (2 of which overlooked the ice surface \u2013 one having a bar), an ice sports shop, cafeteria, video games area, skate hire, 8 team changing rooms (1 reserved for the home professional ice hockey team), DJ box, management offices and an [[Ice hockey rink#International|olympic sized ice pad]].{{cn|date=January 2013}} Its facilities and ice pad was one of several rinks which opened in the 1980s and '90s. In the early '90s two of Bladerunner's smaller changing rooms were converted into a large changing room, office and meeting area for the specific use of the Milton Keynes Kings Junior Ice Hockey Club.\n\n===1990\u201396===\n\nBladerunner would regularly sellout on Kings game nights and would often have to turn customers away due to the success of their public ice skating sessions. Other events included ice shows, figure skating competitions and concerts. On several occasions the [[Great Britain men's national ice hockey team]] used the arena for training camps and games and it was also used as the training base for Olympic champion figure skaters, [[Jane Torvill]] & [[Christopher Dean]].\n\nIn 1992 arena owners First Leisure closed the venue, however it was opened soon after following public outcry, including public rallies outside the offices of [[Milton Keynes Council]] and First Leisure. Public demand saw the ice rink re-open in time for the 1992/93 ice hockey season. However this was not the last time the ice rink would close its doors, a second short closing and re-opening in the early 1990s was followed by a permanent closure in 1996.\n\n===1996 closure===\n\nPublic protest and the popularity of the Kings ice hockey team were not enough to find a new owner for the ice rink and the doors became locked, apparently for good, in the summer of 1996. Users of the ice rink instead were forced to travel over an hour to ice rinks in Oxford, Stevenage, Peterborough and Haringey \u2013 including the MK Kings Junior Ice Hockey Club who re-located first to Stevenage and then to Haringey under the Milton Keynes name.\n\n===1998 re-opening===\n\nAfter two years of closure the arena re-opened under the new ownership in April 1998 and was renamed [[Planet Ice]], with the Kings ice hockey team being re-formed in the third tier of English ice hockey under the ownership of local businessman Mike Darnell. Popularity of the venue was just as high as when the venue first opened in 1990, with Planet Ice's learn to skate courses being over-subscribed for several years. The arena featured several changes when it was re-opened, including; large scale re-decoration, the ice sports shop in the arena concourse being bricked up, the alcohol kiosk at bar level converted into a store room, a new 'Skate Xpress' shop opening in the skate hire area of the building. Not all areas of the ice rink complex re-opened, including the restaurant which remained closed.\n\nIn addition to the [[Milton Keynes Kings|MK Kings]] re-formation, Planet Ice reached an agreement with [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] for their newly formed [[Ice Hockey Superleague|Superleague]] side [[London Knights (UK)|London Knights]] to use the arena as their training base. This saw the junior club's purpose built changing room converted into a luxury dressing room with a two of the smaller changing rooms converted into an office and gym, all for exclusive use by the Knights. Delays in the opening of the Knights new arena in London saw the team play several home games in Milton Keynes before they were finally able to host games at the [[London Arena]] whilst the team trained and lived in MK. Planet Ice was sporadically converted into a basketball court and used as home venue for [[British Basketball League]] side [[Milton Keynes Lions]] for home games selected for live television coverage on [[Sky Sports]].\n\n===2000\u201302===\n\nThe Knights left Milton Keynes in the summer of 2000, moving to [[Lea Valley]] to be based closer to their home arena.

It was the last group to be selected during the [[Project Apollo]] era, and the first since the [[Mercury Seven]] in which all members were military personnel, and all made flights to space. After the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL) project was cancelled, NASA accepted the seven youngest MOL astronauts. By the time they joined NASA, all Apollo flight assignments had been lined up, but four of them were given non-flying support assignments for [[Project Apollo]], [[Skylab]] and the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. Group 7 went on to form the core of early [[Space Shuttle]] pilots, upgrading to commander after their first flight, and flying 17 missions between them.\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|Manned Orbiting Laboratory}}\nThe launch of the [[Sputnik 1]] satellite by the [[Soviet Union]] on October 4, 1957, started a [[Cold War]] technological and ideological competition with the United States known as the [[Space Race]]. The demonstration of American technological inferiority came as a profound shock to the American public.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}} The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) was already working on a delta-wing, rocket-propelled glider that came to be called the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=71}} In response to a January 1958 request from the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]], the USAF put forward a proposal for a manned space program called [[Man in Space Soonest]] (MISS) that would use [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor rockets]] to lift a simple ballistic capsule into orbit.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=77, 91}} But on August 18, 1958, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] decided to transfer responsibility for manned space flight to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). NASA's [[Project Mercury]] replaced Man in Space Soonest, and [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald A. Quarles]] transferred $53.8 million that that had been set aside for USAF space projects, including Man in Space Soonest (but not Dyna-Soar) to NASA.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101-102}}\n\nThis did not end the USAF's interest in space. NASA was a civilian program, but there were military aspects of space exploration as well. In particular, the USAF was interested in reconnaissance from space. This was the time of the [[Cold War]], and there was intense interest in the Soviet Union's military and industrial capabilities. The [[1960 U-2 incident|downing]] of a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane in 1960 left a gap in American espionage capabilities that it was hoped that spy satellites would be able to fill. The original intention was that Dyna-Soar would be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] rocket and perform these missions. On 1961 the new [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Robert McNamara]], ordered that Dyna-Soar be launched into orbit. On 25 August 1962, the [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Eugene Zuckert]] ordered the Commander of the [[Air Force Systems Command]], [[General (United States)|Bernard A. Schriever]], to prepare studies of a manned spy satellite, which became the [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL).{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2-3}} Shriever became MOL's project director, reporting directly to the Secretary of the Air Force.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=14}}  Initially, it was proposed that MOL would be serviced by Dyna-Soar, but McNamara cancelled Dyna-Soar on December 10, 1963, and decided that MOL would use a modified [[Project Gemini]] spacecraft instead.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2-3}}\n\n== Selection ==\n[[File:Manned Orbiting Laboratory Astronaut Group 1.jpg|thumb|right|First MOL astronaut group.

Peterson, and James A. Abrahamson]]\n\nTo provide prospective astronauts for the [[X-15]], Dyna-Soar and MOL programs, the USAF created the Aerospace Research Pilot Course at the [[USAF Experimental Flight Test Pilot School]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in California. Four classes were conducted between June 1961, and May 1963. The third class received instruction on Dyna-Soar as part of the course. The USAF Experimental Test Pilot School was renamed the Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS)on October 12, 1961.{{sfn|Eppley|1963|pp=11-13}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=xxvi-xxvii}} When it came to selecting astronauts for MOL, the commandant of the ARPS, Shriever took the advice of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Chuck Yeager|Charles E. \"Chuck\" Yeager]], the commandant of the ARPS, and restricted selection to ATPS graduates. No call for volunteers was issued; fifteen candidates were selected and ordered to report to [[Brooks Air Force Base]] on [[San Antonio, Texas]], for a week of medical evaluation in October 1964. The evaluations were similar to those conducted for the NASA astronauts groups.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=2-3}}\n\nThe MOL Program was publicly approved by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on August 15, 1965.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=13}} For the selection of first three NASA astronaut groups in [[Mercury Seven|1959]], [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|1962]] and [[NASA Astronaut Group 3|1963]], the USAF had established a selection board to review candidates before forwarding their names to NASA. The [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the USAF]], General [[John P. McConnell]], told Shriever he expected the selection of MOL astronauts to follow the same procedure. Accordingly, a selection board was convened in September 1965, chaired by [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Jerry D. Page]]. On September 15, the selection criteria for was MOL astronauts was announced.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5-6}} Candidates had to be:\n* Qualified military pilots;\n* Graduates of the ARPS;\n* Serving officers, recommended by their commanding officers; and\n* Holding US citizenship from birth.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5-6}}\n\nThe names of the first group of eight MOL astronauts were publicly announced on November 12, 1965:\n* [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Michael J. Adams]], USAF;\n* Major [[Albert H. Crews|Albert H. Crews Jr.]], USAF;\n* [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] [[John L. Finley]], USN;\n* [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Richard E. Lawyer]], USAF;\n* Captain [[Lachlan Macleay]], USAF;\n* Captain [[Francis G. Neubeck]], USAF;\n* Major [[James M. Taylor]], USAF; and\n* Lieutenant [[Richard H. Truly]], USN.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5-6}}\n\nAround this time, the USAF began selecting a second group of MO:L astronauts. This time applications were called for, and the process was run concurrently with selection for [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]]. Over 500 applications were received, from which the names of 100 candidates were forwarded to USAF headquarters. The MOL Program Office selected 25 of these, who were sent to Brooks Air Force Base for physical evaluation in January and February 1966. Five were selected.The names of the second group of MOL astronauts were publicly announced on June 17, 1966:\n* Captain [[Karol J. Bobko]], USAF;\n* Lieutenant [[Robert L. Crippen]], USN;\n* Captain [[C. Gordon Fullerton]], USAF;\n* Captain [[Henry W. Hartsfield]], USAF; and\n* Captain [[Robert F. Overmyer]], USMC.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=23-25}}\nBobko became the first graduate of the [[United States Air Force Academy]] to be selected as an astronaut.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|p=26}}\n\nEight other finalists had not yet completed the ARPS course. One was already attending; the other seven were sent to Edwards Air Force Base to join Class 66B. They would be considered for the next MOL astronaut intake. The MOL Astronaut Selection Board met again on May 11, 1967, and recommended that four of the eight be appointed. The MOL Program Office announced names of those selected for the third group of MOL astronauts on June 30, 1967, at a press conference in Los Angeles:\n* Major [[James A. Abrahamson]], USAF;\n* [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Robert T. Herres]], USAF;\n* Major [[Robert Henry Lawrence Jr.|Robert H. Lawrence Jr]]., USAF; and \n* Major [[Donald H. Peterson]], USAF.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=26-28}}\nLawrence was the first [[African-American]] to be selected as an astronaut. He might have become the first one to become a NASA astronaut, but was killed in an [[F-104]] crash at Edwards Air Force Base on December 8,1967.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=40-41}}\n\n== Transfer to NASA ==\nThroughout the MOL Program there was debate over the necessity of a manned spy satellite as opposed to an unmanned one, given the difficulty, danger and expense involved. The technologies required for both were still immature, and In many ways, the two benefited from each other, so the USAF continued to pursue both.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=69-72}} The rising cost of the [[Vietnam War]] affected both military and civil space programs, and in November 1965 the MOL Program's funding for [[fiscal year]] 1967 was cut by 60 percent, delaying the first flight until April 1969. At the same time, the cost of the MOL Program had blown out significantly. Originally costed at $1.5 billion, the cost had more than doubled, and by 1968 it was consuming about 17% of the Air Force Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation budget. Budget cuts only delayed the program further, and the first manned flight had been pushed back to December 1971. In turn, each slip made the project harder to justify. Seeing little hope of flying in space, Adams left the program in July 1966, and Finley in April 1968.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=76-79}} The axe finally fell on June 10, 1969, when the MOL Project was cancelled.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=87}} \n\nAt this point, fourteen MOL astronauts remained in the program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=87}} All but Herres wanted to transfer to NASA. They flew to Houston to meet with NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, [[Deke Slayton]]. Slayton told them that he did not need more astronauts; he already had more than he needed for a diminishing number of [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Apollo Applications Program]] flights. [[Robert R. Gilruth]], the director of the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]], agreed with him. But [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]] NASA's Deputy Administrator, saw things differently: sooner or later NASA would need help from the USAF, and maintaining good relations with it was good policy. A compromise was agreed upon; Slayton and Gilruth agreed to take those who met its age limit of 36. Seven of the thirteen were 36 or younger, and were accepted into the NASA Astronaut Corps. NASA also took Crews, although not as an astronaut. NASA's acceptance of the seven MOL astronauts was announced on August 9, 1969.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=91-92}}{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=249-251}}\n\n== Group members ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Image\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Born\n! scope=\"col\" | Died\n! scope=\"col\" | Career\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | ref\n|-\n|[[File:Bobko.jpg|200px|alt=Portrait]]\n|data-sort-value=Bobko|[[Karol J.

Fullerton served on the support crews for the Apollo 14 and 17 lunar landing missions, and was CAPCOM for Apollo 14, 15, 16 and 17.  Hartsfield and Peterson were part of the support crew of Apollo 16, and Overmyer of Apollo 17, and they shared CAPCOM duties on those missions.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|pp=270-271}} Crippen, Hartsfield and Truly served on the support crews for the Skylab missions,{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=304-305}}  and Bobko, Crippen, Overmyer and Truly served on the support crew for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=308-309}}\n\nOn February 24, 1976, NASA announced the two crews of two astronauts to fly the Approach and Landing Tests in the {{OV|101|full=nolink}}. In each case, one of the MOL astronauts was paired with one of the members of [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]] who had already flown in space. The commander of the first crew was [[Fred Haise]], with Fullerton as pilot, and the second was commanded by [[Joe Engle]], with Truly as pilot. By this time, only 31 of the 73 pilot and scientist astronauts selected between 1959 and 1969 remained with NASA; they would soon be outnumbered by the [[NASA Astronaut Group 8|35 newcomers]] selected in 1978.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=314-315}}\n\nThe pattern of a senior astronaut flying as command with a member of the seven MOL astronauts as pilot was followed for the first six Space Shuttle missions, after which all had flown. Ironically, given that they had trained for Gemini spacecraft in which they would work in pairs, the April 1983 [[STS-6]] mission was the only one in which two of them flew on the same mission. Peterson's extravehicular activity on that mission, the first in the Space Shuttle program, would be the only one conducted by a member of the group, all the other members of which would go on to fly at least one more mission, but as commander before they retired.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=324-331}}  \n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Eppley |first=Charles V. |title=History of the USAF Experimental Test Pilot School 4 February 1951 \u2013 12 October 1961 |location=Edwards Air Force Base |publisher=United States Air Force |date=March 1963 |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/400112.pdf |access-date=5 February 2019 |oclc=831992420 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Homer |first=Courtney V.

It was the last group to be selected during the [[Project Apollo]] era, and the first since the [[Mercury Seven]] in which all members were military personnel, and all made flights to space. After the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL) project was cancelled, NASA accepted the seven youngest MOL astronauts. By the time they joined NASA, all Apollo flight assignments had been lined up, but four of them were given non-flying support assignments for [[Project Apollo]], [[Skylab]] and the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. Group 7 went on to form the core of early [[Space Shuttle]] pilots, upgrading to commander after their first flight, and flying 17 missions between them.\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|Manned Orbiting Laboratory}}\nThe launch of the [[Sputnik 1]] satellite by the [[Soviet Union]] on October 4, 1957, started a [[Cold War]] technological and ideological competition with the United States known as the [[Space Race]]. The demonstration of American technological inferiority came as a profound shock to the American public.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}} The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) was already working on a delta-wing, rocket-propelled glider that came to be called the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=71}} In response to a January 1958 request from the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]], the USAF put forward a proposal for a manned space program called [[Man in Space Soonest]] (MISS) that would use [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor rockets]] to lift a simple ballistic capsule into orbit.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=77, 91}} But on August 18, 1958, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] decided to transfer responsibility for manned space flight to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). NASA's [[Project Mercury]] replaced Man in Space Soonest, and [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald A. Quarles]] transferred $53.8 million that that had been set aside for USAF space projects, including Man in Space Soonest (but not Dyna-Soar) to NASA.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101-102}}\n\nThis did not end the USAF's interest in space. NASA was a civilian program, but there were military aspects of space exploration as well. In particular, the USAF was interested in reconnaissance from space. This was the time of the [[Cold War]], and there was intense interest in the Soviet Union's military and industrial capabilities. The [[1960 U-2 incident|downing]] of a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane in 1960 left a gap in American espionage capabilities that it was hoped that spy satellites would be able to fill. The original intention was that Dyna-Soar would be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] rocket and perform these missions. On 1961 the new [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Robert McNamara]], ordered that Dyna-Soar be launched into orbit. On 25 August 1962, the [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Eugene Zuckert]] ordered the Commander of the [[Air Force Systems Command]], [[General (United States)|Bernard A. Schriever]], to prepare studies of a manned spy satellite, which became the [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL).{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2-3}} Shriever became MOL's project director, reporting directly to the Secretary of the Air Force.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=14}}  Initially, it was proposed that MOL would be serviced by Dyna-Soar, but McNamara cancelled Dyna-Soar on December 10, 1963, and decided that MOL would use a modified [[Project Gemini]] spacecraft instead.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2-3}}\n\n== Selection ==\n[[File:Manned Orbiting Laboratory Astronaut Group 1.jpg|thumb|right|First MOL astronaut group.

Abrahamson]]\n\nTo provide prospective astronauts for the [[X-15]], Dyna-Soar and MOL programs, the USAF created the Aerospace Research Pilot Course at the [[USAF Experimental Flight Test Pilot School]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in California. Four classes were conducted between June 1961, and May 1963. The third class received instruction on Dyna-Soar as part of the course. The USAF Experimental Test Pilot School was renamed the Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS)on October 12, 1961.{{sfn|Eppley|1963|pp=11-13}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=xxvi-xxvii}} When it came to selecting astronauts for MOL, the commandant of the ARPS, Shriever took the advice of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Chuck Yeager|Charles E. \"Chuck\" Yeager]], the commandant of the ARPS, and restricted selection to ATPS graduates. No call for volunteers was issued; fifteen candidates were selected and ordered to report to [[Brooks Air Force Base]] on [[San Antonio, Texas]], for a week of medical evaluation in October 1964. The evaluations were similar to those conducted for the NASA astronauts groups.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=2-3}}\n\nThe MOL Program was publicly approved by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on August 15, 1965.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=13}} For the selection of first three NASA astronaut groups in [[Mercury Seven|1959]], [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|1962]] and [[NASA Astronaut Group 3|1963]], the USAF had established a selection board to review candidates before forwarding their names to NASA. The [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the USAF]], General [[John P. McConnell]], told Shriever he expected the selection of MOL astronauts to follow the same procedure. Accordingly, a selection board was convened in September 1965, chaired by [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Jerry D. Page]]. On September 15, the selection criteria for was MOL astronauts was announced.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5-6}} Candidates had to be:\n* Qualified military pilots;\n* Graduates of the ARPS;\n* Serving officers, recommended by their commanding officers; and\n* Holding US citizenship from birth.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5-6}}\n\nThe names of the first group of eight MOL astronauts were publicly announced on November 12, 1965:\n* [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Michael J. Adams]], USAF;\n* Major [[Albert H. Crews|Albert H. Crews Jr.]], USAF;\n* [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] [[John L. Finley]], USN;\n* [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Richard E. Lawyer]], USAF;\n* Captain [[Lachlan Macleay]], USAF;\n* Captain [[Francis G. Neubeck]], USAF;\n* Major [[James M. Taylor]], USAF; and\n* Lieutenant [[Richard H. Truly]], USN.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5-6}}\n\nAround this time, the USAF began selecting a second group of MO:L astronauts. This time applications were called for, and the process was run concurrently with selection for [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]]. Over 500 applications were received, from which the names of 100 candidates were forwarded to USAF headquarters. The MOL Program Office selected 25 of these, who were sent to Brooks Air Force Base for physical evaluation in January and February 1966. Five were selected.The names of the second group of MOL astronauts were publicly announced on June 17, 1966:\n* Captain [[Karol J. Bobko]], USAF;\n* Lieutenant [[Robert L. Crippen]], USN;\n* Captain [[C. Gordon Fullerton]], USAF;\n* Captain [[Henry W. Hartsfield]], USAF; and\n* Captain [[Robert F. Overmyer]], USMC.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=23-25}}\nBobko became the first graduate of the [[United States Air Force Academy]] to be selected as an astronaut.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|p=26}}\n\nEight other finalists had not yet completed the ARPS course. One was already attending; the other seven were sent to Edwards Air Force Base to join Class 66B. They would be considered for the next MOL astronaut intake. The MOL Astronaut Selection Board met again on May 11, 1967, and recommended that four of the eight be appointed. The MOL Program Office announced names of those selected for the third group of MOL astronauts on June 30, 1967, at a press conference in Los Angeles:\n* Major [[James A. Abrahamson]], USAF;\n* [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Robert T. Herres]], USAF;\n* Major [[Robert Henry Lawrence Jr.|Robert H. Lawrence Jr]]., USAF; and \n* Major [[Donald H. Peterson]], USAF.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=26-28}}\nLawrence was the first [[African-American]] to be selected as an astronaut. He might have become the first one to become a NASA astronaut, but was killed in an [[F-104]] crash at Edwards Air Force Base on December 8,1967.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=40-41}}\n\n== Transfer to NASA ==\nThroughout the MOL Program there was debate over the necessity of a manned spy satellite as opposed to an unmanned one, given the difficulty, danger and expense involved. The technologies required for both were still immature, and In many ways, the two benefited from each other, so the USAF continued to pursue both.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=69-72}} The rising cost of the [[Vietnam War]] affected both military and civil space programs, and in November 1965 the MOL Program's funding for [[fiscal year]] 1967 was cut by 60 percent, delaying the first flight until April 1969. At the same time, the cost of the MOL Program had blown out significantly. Originally costed at $1.5 billion, the cost had more than doubled, and by 1968 it was consuming about 17% of the Air Force Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation budget. Budget cuts only delayed the program further, and the first manned flight had been pushed back to December 1971. In turn, each slip made the project harder to justify. Seeing little hope of flying in space, Adams left the program in July 1966, and Finley in April 1968.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=76-79}} The axe finally fell on June 10, 1969, when the MOL Project was cancelled.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=87}} \n\nAt this point, fourteen MOL astronauts remained in the program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=87}} All but Herres wanted to transfer to NASA. They flew to Houston to meet with NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, [[Deke Slayton]]. Slayton told them that he did not need more astronauts; he already had more than he needed for a diminishing number of [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Apollo Applications Program]] flights. [[Robert R. Gilruth]], the director of the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]], agreed with him. But [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]] NASA's Deputy Administrator, saw things differently: sooner or later NASA would need help from the USAF, and maintaining good relations with it was good policy. A compromise was agreed upon; Slayton and Gilruth agreed to take those who met its age limit of 36. Seven of the thirteen were 36 or younger, and were accepted into the NASA Astronaut Corps. NASA also took Crews, although not as an astronaut. NASA's acceptance of the seven MOL astronauts was announced on August 9, 1969.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=91-92}}{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=249-251}}\n\n== Group members ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Image\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Born\n! scope=\"col\" | Died\n! scope=\"col\" | Career\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | ref\n|-\n|[[File:Bobko.jpg|200px|alt=Portrait]]\n|data-sort-value=Bobko|[[Karol J.

The first rung on the ladder was selection to a mission support crew. Fullerton served on the support crews for the Apollo 14 and 17 lunar landing missions, and was CAPCOM for Apollo 14, 15, 16 and 17.  Hartsfield and Peterson were part of the support crew of Apollo 16, and Overmyer of Apollo 17, and they shared CAPCOM duties on those missions.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|pp=270-271}} Crippen, Hartsfield and Truly served on the support crews for the Skylab missions,{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=304-305}}  and Bobko, Crippen, Overmyer and Truly served on the support crew for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=308-309}}\n\nOn February 24, 1976, NASA announced the two crews of two astronauts to fly the Approach and Landing Tests in the {{OV|101|full=nolink}}. In each case, one of the MOL astronauts was paired with one of the members of [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]] who had already flown in space. The commander of the first crew was [[Fred Haise]], with Fullerton as pilot, and the second was commanded by [[Joe Engle]], with Truly as pilot. By this time, only 31 of the 73 pilot and scientist astronauts selected between 1959 and 1969 remained with NASA; they would soon be outnumbered by the [[NASA Astronaut Group 8|35 newcomers]] selected in 1978.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=314-315}}\n\nThe pattern of a senior astronaut flying as command with a member of the seven MOL astronauts as pilot was followed for the first six Space Shuttle missions, after which all had flown. Ironically, given that they had trained for Gemini spacecraft in which they would work in pairs, the April 1983 [[STS-6]] mission was the only one in which two of them flew on the same mission. Peterson's extravehicular activity on that mission, the first in the Space Shuttle program, would be the only one conducted by a member of the group, all the other members of which would go on to fly at least one more mission, but as commander before they retired.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=324-331}}  \n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Eppley |first=Charles V. |title=History of the USAF Experimental Test Pilot School 4 February 1951 \u2013 12 October 1961 |publisher=United States Air Force |date=March 1963 |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/400112.pdf |access-date=5 February 2019 |oclc=831992420 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Homer |first=Courtney V.
