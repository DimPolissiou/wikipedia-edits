As of the GeForce 20 Super series, there have been sixteen iterations of the design.  The first GeForce products were discrete GPUs designed for add-on graphics boards, intended for the high-margin PC gaming market, and later diversification of the product line covered all tiers of the PC graphics market, ranging from cost-sensitive<ref name=\"Nvdia Geforce\" /> GPUs integrated on motherboards, to mainstream add-in retail boards.  Most recently, GeForce technology has been introduced into Nvidia's line of embedded application processors, designed for electronic handhelds and mobile handsets.\n\nWith respect to discrete GPUs, found in add-in graphics-boards, Nvidia's GeForce and [[AMD]]'s [[Radeon]] GPUs are the only remaining competitors in the high-end market. Along with its nearest competitor, the AMD Radeon, the GeForce architecture is moving toward [[GPGPU|general-purpose graphics processor unit]] (GPGPU).{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} GPGPU is expected to expand GPU functionality beyond the traditional rasterization of 3D graphics, to turn it into a high-performance computing device able to execute arbitrary programming code in the same way a CPU does, but with different strengths (highly parallel execution of straightforward calculations) and weaknesses (worse performance for complex [[Branch (computer science)|branching]] code).\n\n== Name origin ==\nThe \"GeForce\" name originated from a contest held by Nvidia in early 1999 called \"Name That Chip\". The company called out to the public to name the successor to the [[RIVA TNT2]] line of graphics boards. There were over 12,000 entries received and 7 winners received a RIVA TNT2 Ultra graphics card as a reward.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nvidia.com/namingcontest | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000608011648/http://www.nvidia.com/namingcontest | title = Winners of the Nvidia Naming Contest | year = 1999 | work = [[Nvidia]] | archivedate = June 8, 2000 | accessdate = May 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Taken | first = Femme | url = http://tweakers.net/nieuws/1967/nVidia-Name-that-chip-contest.html | title = Nvidia \"Name that chip\" contest | work = [[Tweakers.net]] | date = April 17, 1999 | accessdate = May 28, 2007 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311065215/http://tweakers.net/nieuws/1967/nVidia-Name-that-chip-contest.html | archivedate = March 11, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Graphics processor generations ==\n{{Timeline of release years\n| title = Generations timeline\n| range1 = 1999-\n| range1_color = #76B900 #619700\n| 1999 = [[GeForce 256]]\n| 2000 = [[GeForce 2 series]]\n| 2001 = [[GeForce 3 series]]\n| 2002 = [[GeForce 4 series]]\n| 2003 = [[GeForce FX series]]\n| 2004 = [[GeForce 6 series]]\n| 2005 = [[GeForce 7 series]]\n| 2006 = [[GeForce 8 series]]\n| 2008a = [[GeForce 9 series]]\n| 2008b = [[GeForce 200 series]]\n| 2009a = [[GeForce 100 series]]\n| 2009b = [[GeForce 300 series]]\n| 2010a = [[GeForce 400 series]]\n| 2010b = [[GeForce 500 series]]\n| 2012 = [[GeForce 600 series]]\n| 2013 = [[GeForce 700 series]]\n| 2014a = [[GeForce 800M series]]\n| 2014b = [[GeForce 900 series]]\n| 2016 = [[GeForce 10 series]]\n| 2018 = [[GeForce 20 series]]\n| 2019 = [[GeForce 16 series]]\n}}\n\n=== GeForce 256 ===\n{{Main|GeForce 256}}\n\nLaunched on August 31, 1999, the GeForce 256 (NV10) was the first consumer-level PC graphics chip shipped with [[Transform and lighting|hardware transform, lighting, and shading]] although 3D games utilizing this [[Rendering (computer graphics)|feature]] did not appear until later. Initial GeForce 256 boards shipped with [[SDRAM#SDR SDRAM|SDR]] [[SDRAM]] memory, and later boards shipped with faster [[DDR SDRAM]] memory.\n\n=== GeForce 2 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 2 series}}\n\nLaunched in April 2000, the first GeForce2 (NV15) was another high-performance graphics chip. Nvidia moved to a twin texture processor per pipeline (4x2) design, doubling texture fillrate per clock compared to GeForce 256. Later, Nvidia released the GeForce2 MX (NV11), which offered performance similar to the GeForce 256 but at a fraction of the cost. The MX was a compelling value in the low/mid-range market segments and was popular with OEM PC manufacturers and users alike. The GeForce 2 Ultra was the high-end model in this series.\n\n=== GeForce 3 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 3 series}}\n\nLaunched in February 2001, the GeForce3 (NV20) introduced programmable [[vertex and pixel shaders]] to the GeForce family and to consumer-level graphics accelerators. It had good overall performance and shader support, making it popular with enthusiasts although it never hit the midrange price point. The ''NV2A'' developed for the [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game console is a derivative of the GeForce 3.\n\n=== GeForce 4 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 4 series}}\n\nLaunched in February 2002, the then-high-end GeForce4 Ti (NV25) was mostly a refinement to the GeForce3. The biggest advancements included enhancements to anti-aliasing capabilities, an improved memory controller, a second vertex shader, and a manufacturing process size reduction to increase clock speeds. Another member of the GeForce 4 family, the budget GeForce4 MX, was based on the GeForce2, with the addition of some features from the GeForce4 Ti. It targeted the value segment of the market and lacked pixel shaders.  Most of these models used the [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] &nbsp;4\u00d7 interface, but a few began the transition to AGP&nbsp;8\u00d7.\n\n=== GeForce FX series ===\n{{Main|GeForce FX series}}\n\nLaunched in 2003, the GeForce FX (NV30) was a huge change in architecture compared to its predecessors. The GPU was designed not only to support the new Shader Model 2 specification but also to perform well on older titles. However, initial models like the GeForce FX 5800 Ultra suffered from weak [[floating point]] shader performance and excessive heat which required infamously noisy two-slot cooling solutions. Products in this series carry the 5000 model number, as it is the fifth generation of the GeForce, though Nvidia marketed the cards as GeForce FX instead of GeForce 5 to show off \"the dawn of cinematic rendering\".\n\n=== GeForce 6 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 6 series}}\n\nLaunched in April 2004, the GeForce 6 (NV40) added Shader Model 3.0 support to the GeForce family, while correcting the weak floating point shader performance of its predecessor.  It also implemented [[high dynamic range imaging]] and introduced [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] (Scalable Link Interface) and [[Nvidia PureVideo|PureVideo]] capability (integrated partial hardware MPEG-2, VC-1, Windows Media Video, and H.264 decoding and fully accelerated video post-processing).\n\n=== GeForce 7 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 7 series}}\n\nThe seventh generation GeForce (G70/NV47) was launched in June 2005 and was the last Nvidia video card series that could support the [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] bus. The design was a refined version of GeForce 6, with the major improvements being a widened pipeline and an increase in clock speed. The GeForce 7 also offers new transparency [[supersampling]] and transparency multisampling anti-aliasing modes (TSAA and TMAA). These new anti-aliasing modes were later enabled for the GeForce 6 series as well.  The GeForce 7950GT featured the highest performance GPU with an AGP interface in the Nvidia line.  This era began the transition to the PCI-Express interface.\n\nA 128-bit, 8 ROP variant of the 7950 GT, called the [[RSX 'Reality Synthesizer']], is used as the main GPU in the Sony [[PlayStation 3]].\n\n=== GeForce 8 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 8 series}}\n\nReleased on November 8, 2006, the eighth-generation GeForce (originally called G80) was the first ever GPU to fully support [[Direct3D]]&nbsp;10. Manufactured using a 90&nbsp;nm process and built around the new [[Tesla (microarchitecture)|Tesla microarchitecture]], it implemented the [[unified shader model]].  Initially just the 8800GTX model was launched, while the GTS variant was released months into the product line's life, and it took nearly six months for mid-range and OEM/mainstream cards to be integrated into the 8 series. The die shrink down to [[65 nanometer|65&nbsp;nm]] and a revision to the G80 design, codenamed G92, were implemented into the 8 series with the 8800GS, 8800GT and 8800GTS-512, first released on October 29, 2007, almost one whole year after the initial G80 release.\n\n=== GeForce 9 series and 100 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 9 series|GeForce 100 series}}\n\nThe first product was released on February 21, 2008.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = https://www.forbes.com/home/technology/forbes/2008/0107/092.html | magazine = Forbes.com | title = Shoot to Kill | author = Brian Caulfield | accessdate = December 26, 2007 | date = January 7, 2008 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071224085947/http://www.forbes.com/home/technology/forbes/2008/0107/092.html | archivedate = December 24, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Not even four months older than the initial G92 release, all 9-series designs are simply revisions to existing late 8-series products. The 9800GX2 uses two G92 GPUs, as used in later 8800 cards, in a dual PCB configuration while still only requiring a single PCI-Express 16x slot. The 9800GX2 utilizes two separate 256-bit memory busses, one for each GPU and its respective 512&nbsp;MB of memory, which equates to an overall of 1&nbsp;GB of memory on the card (although the SLI configuration of the chips necessitates mirroring the frame buffer between the two chips, thus effectively halving the memory performance of a 256-bit/512MB configuration). The later 9800GTX features a single G92 GPU, 256-bit data bus, and 512&nbsp;MB of GDDR3 memory.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nvidia.com/object/geforce_9800gtx.html | title = NVIDIA GeForce 9800 GTX | accessdate = May 31, 2008 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080529170120/http://www.nvidia.com/object/geforce_9800gtx.html | archivedate = May 29, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nPrior to the release, no concrete information was known except that the officials claimed the next generation products had close to 1&nbsp;TFLOPS processing power with the GPU cores still being manufactured in the 65&nbsp;nm process, and reports about Nvidia downplaying the significance of [[Direct3D]]&nbsp;10.1.<ref>[http://www.dailytech.com/Crytek+Microsoft+Nvidia+Downplay+DirectX+101/article9656.htm DailyTech report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705162712/http://www.dailytech.com/Crytek+Microsoft+Nvidia+Downplay+DirectX+101/article9656.htm |date=July 5, 2008 }}: Crytek, Microsoft and Nvidia downplay Direct3D 10.1, retrieved December 4, 2007</ref> On March 2009, several sources reported that Nvidia had quietly launched a new series of GeForce products, namely the GeForce 100 Series, which consists of rebadged 9 Series parts.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bit-tech.net/news/hardware/2009/03/23/nvidia-quietly-geforce-100-series/1 | title = Nvidia quietly launches GeForce 100-series GPUs | date = April 6, 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090326054142/http://www.bit-tech.net/news/hardware/2009/03/23/nvidia-quietly-geforce-100-series/1 | archivedate = March 26, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/news/3728 | title = nVidia Launches GeForce 100 Series Cards | date = March 10, 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110711151956/http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/news/3728 | archivedate = July 11, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wiyule.com/2009/03/24/nvidia-quietly-launches-geforce-100-series-gpus/ | title = Nvidia quietly launches GeForce 100-series GPUs | date = March 24, 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090521223059/http://www.wiyule.com/2009/03/24/nvidia-quietly-launches-geforce-100-series-gpus/ | archivedate = May 21, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> GeForce 100 series products were not available for individual purchase.<ref name=\"Nvdia Geforce\" />\n\n=== GeForce 200 series and 300 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 200 series|GeForce 300 series}}\n\nBased on the GT200 graphics processor consisting of 1.4 billion transistors, codenamed Tesla, the 200 series was launched on June 16, 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://benchmarkreviews.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=179&Itemid=1 | title = NVIDIA GeForce GTX 280 Video Card Review | date = June 16, 2008 | publisher = Benchmark Reviews | accessdate = June 16, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080617212421/http://benchmarkreviews.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=179&Itemid=1 | archivedate = June 17, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The next generation of the GeForce series takes the card-naming scheme in a new direction, by replacing the series number (such as 8800 for 8-series cards) with the GTX or GTS suffix (which used to go at the end of card names, denoting their 'rank' among other similar models), and then adding model-numbers such as 260 and 280 after that.

The GTX 470 and GTX 480 were heavily criticized due to high power use, high temperatures, and very loud noise that were not balanced by the performance offered, even though the GTX 480 was the fastest DirectX 11 card as of its introduction.\n\nIn November 2010, Nvidia released a new flagship GPU based on an enhanced GF100 architecture (GF110) called the GTX 580. It featured higher performance, less power utilization, heat and noise than the preceding GTX 480. This GPU received much better reviews than the GTX 480. Nvidia later also released the GTX 590, which packs two GF110 GPUs on a single card.\n\n=== GeForce 600 series, 700 series and 800M series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 600 series|GeForce 700 series|GeForce 800M series}}\n[[File:ASUS GTX-650 Ti TOP Cu-II PCI Express 3.0 x16 graphics card.jpg|thumb|[[Asus]] Nvidia GeForce GTX 650 Ti, a PCI Express 3.0 \u00d716 graphics card]]\n\nIn September 2010, Nvidia announced that the successor to [[Fermi (microarchitecture)|Fermi microarchitecture]] would be the [[Kepler (microarchitecture)|Kepler microarchitecture]], manufactured with the TSMC 28&nbsp;nm fabrication process. Earlier, Nvidia had been contracted to supply their top-end GK110 cores for use in [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]'s [[Titan (supercomputer)|\"Titan\" supercomputer]], leading to a shortage of GK110 cores.  After AMD launched their own annual refresh in early 2012, the Radeon HD 7000 series, Nvidia began the release of the GeForce 600 series in March 2012.  The GK104 core, originally intended for their mid-range segment of their lineup, became the flagship GTX&nbsp;680.  It introduced significant improvements in performance, heat, and power efficiency compared to the Fermi architecture and closely matched AMD's flagship Radeon HD 7970.  It was quickly followed by the dual-GK104 GTX&nbsp;690 and the GTX&nbsp;670, which featured only a slightly cut-down GK104 core and was very close in performance to the GTX&nbsp;680.\n\nWith the GTX TITAN, Nvidia also released GPU Boost 2.0, which would allow the GPU clock speed to increase indefinitely until a user-set temperature limit was reached without passing a user-specified maximum fan speed.  The final GeForce 600 series release was the GTX 650 Ti BOOST based on the GK106 core, in response to AMD's Radeon HD&nbsp;7790 release.  At the end of May 2013, Nvidia announced the 700 series, which was still based on the Kepler architecture, however it featured a GK110-based card at the top of the lineup.  The GTX 780 was a slightly cut-down TITAN that achieved nearly the same performance for two-thirds of the price.  It featured the same advanced reference cooler design, but did not have the unlocked double-precision cores and was equipped with 3&nbsp;GB of memory.\n\nAt the same time, Nvidia announced [[Nvidia Shadowplay|ShadowPlay]], a screen capture solution that used an integrated H.264 encoder built into the Kepler architecture that Nvidia had not revealed previously.  It could be used to record gameplay without a capture card, and with negligible performance decrease compared to software recording solutions, and was available even on the previous generation GeForce 600 series cards.  The software beta for ShadowPlay, however, experienced multiple delays and would not be released until the end of October 2013.  A week after the release of the GTX&nbsp;780, Nvidia announced the GTX&nbsp;770 to be a rebrand of the GTX&nbsp;680.  It was followed by the GTX&nbsp;760 shortly after, which was also based on the GK104 core and similar to the GTX 660 Ti.  No more 700 series cards were set for release in 2013, although Nvidia announced G-Sync, another feature of the Kepler architecture that Nvidia had left unmentioned, which allowed the GPU to dynamically control the refresh rate of G-Sync-compatible monitors which would release in 2014, to combat tearing and judder.  However, in October, AMD released the R9&nbsp;290X, which came in at $100 less than the GTX&nbsp;780. In response, Nvidia slashed the price of the GTX&nbsp;780 by $150 and released the GTX&nbsp;780&nbsp;Ti, which featured a full 2880-core GK110 core even more powerful than the GTX TITAN, along with enhancements to the power delivery system which improved overclocking, and managed to pull ahead of AMD's new release.\n\nThe GeForce 800M series consists of rebranded 700M series parts based on the Kepler architecture and some lower-end parts based on the newer Maxwell architecture.\n\n=== GeForce 900 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 900 series}}\n\nIn March 2013, Nvidia announced that the successor to Kepler would be the [[Maxwell (microarchitecture)|Maxwell microarchitecture]].<ref name=\"AnandTech_roadmap2013\">{{cite web | url = http://www.anandtech.com/show/6846/nvidia-updates-gpu-roadmap-announces-volta-family-for-beyond-2014 | title = NVIDIA Updates GPU Roadmap; Announces Volta Family For Beyond 2014 | last = Smith | first = Ryan | date = March 19, 2013 | publisher = AnandTech | accessdate = March 19, 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130321035037/http://www.anandtech.com/show/6846/nvidia-updates-gpu-roadmap-announces-volta-family-for-beyond-2014 | archivedate = March 21, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> It was released in September 2014.

As of the GeForce 20 Super series, there have been sixteen iterations of the design.  The first GeForce products were discrete GPUs designed for add-on graphics boards, intended for the high-margin PC gaming market, and later diversification of the product line covered all tiers of the PC graphics market, ranging from cost-sensitive<ref name=\"Nvdia Geforce\" /> GPUs integrated on motherboards, to mainstream add-in retail boards.  Most recently, GeForce technology has been introduced into Nvidia's line of embedded application processors, designed for electronic handhelds and mobile handsets.\n\nWith respect to discrete GPUs, found in add-in graphics-boards, Nvidia's GeForce and [[AMD]]'s [[Radeon]] GPUs are the only remaining competitors in the high-end market. Along with its nearest competitor, the AMD Radeon, the GeForce architecture is moving toward [[GPGPU|general-purpose graphics processor unit]] (GPGPU).{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} GPGPU is expected to expand GPU functionality beyond the traditional rasterization of 3D graphics, to turn it into a high-performance computing device able to execute arbitrary programming code in the same way a CPU does, but with different strengths (highly parallel execution of straightforward calculations) and weaknesses (worse performance for complex [[Branch (computer science)|branching]] code).\n\n== Name origin ==\nThe \"GeForce\" name originated from a contest held by Nvidia in early 1999 called \"Name That Chip\". The company called out to the public to name the successor to the [[RIVA TNT2]] line of graphics boards. There were over 12,000 entries received and 7 winners received a RIVA TNT2 Ultra graphics card as a reward.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nvidia.com/namingcontest | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000608011648/http://www.nvidia.com/namingcontest | title = Winners of the Nvidia Naming Contest | year = 1999 | work = [[Nvidia]] | archivedate = June 8, 2000 | accessdate = May 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Taken | first = Femme | url = http://tweakers.net/nieuws/1967/nVidia-Name-that-chip-contest.html | title = Nvidia \"Name that chip\" contest | work = [[Tweakers.net]] | date = April 17, 1999 | accessdate = May 28, 2007 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311065215/http://tweakers.net/nieuws/1967/nVidia-Name-that-chip-contest.html | archivedate = March 11, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Graphics processor generations ==\n{{Timeline of release years\n| title = Generations timeline\n| range1 = 1999-\n| range1_color = #76B900 #619700\n| 1999 = [[GeForce 256]]\n| 2000 = [[GeForce 2 series]]\n| 2001 = [[GeForce 3 series]]\n| 2002 = [[GeForce 4 series]]\n| 2003 = [[GeForce FX series]]\n| 2004 = [[GeForce 6 series]]\n| 2005 = [[GeForce 7 series]]\n| 2006 = [[GeForce 8 series]]\n| 2008a = [[GeForce 9 series]]\n| 2008b = [[GeForce 200 series]]\n| 2009a = [[GeForce 100 series]]\n| 2009b = [[GeForce 300 series]]\n| 2010a = [[GeForce 400 series]]\n| 2010b = [[GeForce 500 series]]\n| 2012 = [[GeForce 600 series]]\n| 2013 = [[GeForce 700 series]]\n| 2014a = [[GeForce 800M series]]\n| 2014b = [[GeForce 900 series]]\n| 2016 = [[GeForce 10 series]]\n| 2018 = [[GeForce 20 series]]\n| 2019 = [[GeForce 16 series]]\n}}\n\n=== GeForce 256 ===\n{{Main|GeForce 256}}\n\nLaunched on August 31, 1999, the GeForce 256 (NV10) was the first consumer-level PC graphics chip shipped with [[Transform and lighting|hardware transform, lighting, and shading]] although 3D games utilizing this [[Rendering (computer graphics)|feature]] did not appear until later. Initial GeForce 256 boards shipped with [[SDRAM#SDR SDRAM|SDR]] [[SDRAM]] memory, and later boards shipped with faster [[DDR SDRAM]] memory.\n\n=== GeForce 2 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 2 series}}\n\nLaunched in April 2000, the first GeForce2 (NV15) was another high-performance graphics chip. Nvidia moved to a twin texture processor per pipeline (4x2) design, doubling texture fillrate per clock compared to GeForce 256. Later, Nvidia released the GeForce2 MX (NV11), which offered performance similar to the GeForce 256 but at a fraction of the cost. The MX was a compelling value in the low/mid-range market segments and was popular with OEM PC manufacturers and users alike. The GeForce 2 Ultra was the high-end model in this series.\n\n=== GeForce 3 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 3 series}}\n\nLaunched in February 2001, the GeForce3 (NV20) introduced programmable [[vertex and pixel shaders]] to the GeForce family and to consumer-level graphics accelerators. It had good overall performance and shader support, making it popular with enthusiasts although it never hit the midrange price point. The ''NV2A'' developed for the [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game console is a derivative of the GeForce 3.\n\n=== GeForce 4 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 4 series}}\n\nLaunched in February 2002, the then-high-end GeForce4 Ti (NV25) was mostly a refinement to the GeForce3. The biggest advancements included enhancements to anti-aliasing capabilities, an improved memory controller, a second vertex shader, and a manufacturing process size reduction to increase clock speeds. Another member of the GeForce 4 family, the budget GeForce4 MX, was based on the GeForce2, with the addition of some features from the GeForce4 Ti. It targeted the value segment of the market and lacked pixel shaders.  Most of these models used the [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] &nbsp;4\u00d7 interface, but a few began the transition to AGP&nbsp;8\u00d7.\n\n=== GeForce FX series ===\n{{Main|GeForce FX series}}\n\nLaunched in 2003, the GeForce FX (NV30) was a huge change in architecture compared to its predecessors. The GPU was designed not only to support the new Shader Model 2 specification but also to perform well on older titles. However, initial models like the GeForce FX 5800 Ultra suffered from weak [[floating point]] shader performance and excessive heat which required infamously noisy two-slot cooling solutions. Products in this series carry the 5000 model number, as it is the fifth generation of the GeForce, though Nvidia marketed the cards as GeForce FX instead of GeForce 5 to show off \"the dawn of cinematic rendering\".\n\n=== GeForce 6 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 6 series}}\n\nLaunched in April 2004, the GeForce 6 (NV40) added Shader Model 3.0 support to the GeForce family, while correcting the weak floating point shader performance of its predecessor.  It also implemented [[high dynamic range imaging]] and introduced [[Scalable Link Interface|SLI]] (Scalable Link Interface) and [[Nvidia PureVideo|PureVideo]] capability (integrated partial hardware MPEG-2, VC-1, Windows Media Video, and H.264 decoding and fully accelerated video post-processing).\n\n=== GeForce 7 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 7 series}}\n\nThe seventh generation GeForce (G70/NV47) was launched in June 2005 and was the last Nvidia video card series that could support the [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] bus. The design was a refined version of GeForce 6, with the major improvements being a widened pipeline and an increase in clock speed. The GeForce 7 also offers new transparency [[supersampling]] and transparency multisampling anti-aliasing modes (TSAA and TMAA). These new anti-aliasing modes were later enabled for the GeForce 6 series as well.  The GeForce 7950GT featured the highest performance GPU with an AGP interface in the Nvidia line.  This era began the transition to the PCI-Express interface.\n\nA 128-bit, 8 ROP variant of the 7950 GT, called the [[RSX 'Reality Synthesizer']], is used as the main GPU in the Sony [[PlayStation 3]].\n\n=== GeForce 8 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 8 series}}\n\nReleased on November 8, 2006, the eighth-generation GeForce (originally called G80) was the first ever GPU to fully support [[Direct3D]]&nbsp;10. Manufactured using a 90&nbsp;nm process and built around the new [[Tesla (microarchitecture)|Tesla microarchitecture]], it implemented the [[unified shader model]].  Initially just the 8800GTX model was launched, while the GTS variant was released months into the product line's life, and it took nearly six months for mid-range and OEM/mainstream cards to be integrated into the 8 series. The die shrink down to [[65 nanometer|65&nbsp;nm]] and a revision to the G80 design, codenamed G92, were implemented into the 8 series with the 8800GS, 8800GT and 8800GTS-512, first released on October 29, 2007, almost one whole year after the initial G80 release.\n\n=== GeForce 9 series and 100 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 9 series|GeForce 100 series}}\n\nThe first product was released on February 21, 2008.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = https://www.forbes.com/home/technology/forbes/2008/0107/092.html | magazine = Forbes.com | title = Shoot to Kill | author = Brian Caulfield | accessdate = December 26, 2007 | date = January 7, 2008 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071224085947/http://www.forbes.com/home/technology/forbes/2008/0107/092.html | archivedate = December 24, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Not even four months older than the initial G92 release, all 9-series designs are simply revisions to existing late 8-series products. The 9800GX2 uses two G92 GPUs, as used in later 8800 cards, in a dual PCB configuration while still only requiring a single PCI-Express 16x slot. The 9800GX2 utilizes two separate 256-bit memory busses, one for each GPU and its respective 512&nbsp;MB of memory, which equates to an overall of 1&nbsp;GB of memory on the card (although the SLI configuration of the chips necessitates mirroring the frame buffer between the two chips, thus effectively halving the memory performance of a 256-bit/512MB configuration). The later 9800GTX features a single G92 GPU, 256-bit data bus, and 512&nbsp;MB of GDDR3 memory.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nvidia.com/object/geforce_9800gtx.html | title = NVIDIA GeForce 9800 GTX | accessdate = May 31, 2008 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080529170120/http://www.nvidia.com/object/geforce_9800gtx.html | archivedate = May 29, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nPrior to the release, no concrete information was known except that the officials claimed the next generation products had close to 1&nbsp;TFLOPS processing power with the GPU cores still being manufactured in the 65&nbsp;nm process, and reports about Nvidia downplaying the significance of [[Direct3D]]&nbsp;10.1.<ref>[http://www.dailytech.com/Crytek+Microsoft+Nvidia+Downplay+DirectX+101/article9656.htm DailyTech report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705162712/http://www.dailytech.com/Crytek+Microsoft+Nvidia+Downplay+DirectX+101/article9656.htm |date=July 5, 2008 }}: Crytek, Microsoft and Nvidia downplay Direct3D 10.1, retrieved December 4, 2007</ref> On March 2009, several sources reported that Nvidia had quietly launched a new series of GeForce products, namely the GeForce 100 Series, which consists of rebadged 9 Series parts.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bit-tech.net/news/hardware/2009/03/23/nvidia-quietly-geforce-100-series/1 | title = Nvidia quietly launches GeForce 100-series GPUs | date = April 6, 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090326054142/http://www.bit-tech.net/news/hardware/2009/03/23/nvidia-quietly-geforce-100-series/1 | archivedate = March 26, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/news/3728 | title = nVidia Launches GeForce 100 Series Cards | date = March 10, 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110711151956/http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/news/3728 | archivedate = July 11, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wiyule.com/2009/03/24/nvidia-quietly-launches-geforce-100-series-gpus/ | title = Nvidia quietly launches GeForce 100-series GPUs | date = March 24, 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090521223059/http://www.wiyule.com/2009/03/24/nvidia-quietly-launches-geforce-100-series-gpus/ | archivedate = May 21, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> GeForce 100 series products were not available for individual purchase.<ref name=\"Nvdia Geforce\" />\n\n=== GeForce 200 series and 300 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 200 series|GeForce 300 series}}\n\nBased on the GT200 graphics processor consisting of 1.4 billion transistors, codenamed Tesla, the 200 series was launched on June 16, 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://benchmarkreviews.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=179&Itemid=1 | title = NVIDIA GeForce GTX 280 Video Card Review | date = June 16, 2008 | publisher = Benchmark Reviews | accessdate = June 16, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080617212421/http://benchmarkreviews.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=179&Itemid=1 | archivedate = June 17, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The next generation of the GeForce series takes the card-naming scheme in a new direction, by replacing the series number (such as 8800 for 8-series cards) with the GTX or GTS suffix (which used to go at the end of card names, denoting their 'rank' among other similar models), and then adding model-numbers such as 260 and 280 after that.

The GTX 470 and GTX 480 were heavily criticized due to high power use, high temperatures, and very loud noise that were not balanced by the performance offered, even though the GTX 480 was the fastest DirectX 11 card as of its introduction.\n\nIn November 2010, Nvidia released a new flagship GPU based on an enhanced GF100 architecture (GF110) called the GTX 580. It featured higher performance, less power utilization, heat and noise than the preceding GTX 480. This GPU received much better reviews than the GTX 480. Nvidia later also released the GTX 590, which packs two GF110 GPUs on a single card.\n\n=== GeForce 600 series, 700 series and 800M series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 600 series|GeForce 700 series|GeForce 800M series}}\n[[File:ASUS GTX-650 Ti TOP Cu-II PCI Express 3.0 x16 graphics card.jpg|thumb|[[Asus]] Nvidia GeForce GTX 650 Ti, a PCI Express 3.0 \u00d716 graphics card]]\n\nIn September 2010, Nvidia announced that the successor to [[Fermi (microarchitecture)|Fermi microarchitecture]] would be the [[Kepler (microarchitecture)|Kepler microarchitecture]], manufactured with the TSMC 28&nbsp;nm fabrication process. Earlier, Nvidia had been contracted to supply their top-end GK110 cores for use in [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]]'s [[Titan (supercomputer)|\"Titan\" supercomputer]], leading to a shortage of GK110 cores.  After AMD launched their own annual refresh in early 2012, the Radeon HD 7000 series, Nvidia began the release of the GeForce 600 series in March 2012.  The GK104 core, originally intended for their mid-range segment of their lineup, became the flagship GTX&nbsp;680.  It introduced significant improvements in performance, heat, and power efficiency compared to the Fermi architecture and closely matched AMD's flagship Radeon HD 7970.  It was quickly followed by the dual-GK104 GTX&nbsp;690 and the GTX&nbsp;670, which featured only a slightly cut-down GK104 core and was very close in performance to the GTX&nbsp;680.\n\nWith the GTX TITAN, Nvidia also released GPU Boost 2.0, which would allow the GPU clock speed to increase indefinitely until a user-set temperature limit was reached without passing a user-specified maximum fan speed.  The final GeForce 600 series release was the GTX 650 Ti BOOST based on the GK106 core, in response to AMD's Radeon HD&nbsp;7790 release.  At the end of May 2013, Nvidia announced the 700 series, which was still based on the Kepler architecture, however it featured a GK110-based card at the top of the lineup.  The GTX 780 was a slightly cut-down TITAN that achieved nearly the same performance for two-thirds of the price.  It featured the same advanced reference cooler design, but did not have the unlocked double-precision cores and was equipped with 3&nbsp;GB of memory.\n\nAt the same time, Nvidia announced [[Nvidia Shadowplay|ShadowPlay]], a screen capture solution that used an integrated H.264 encoder built into the Kepler architecture that Nvidia had not revealed previously.  It could be used to record gameplay without a capture card, and with negligible performance decrease compared to software recording solutions, and was available even on the previous generation GeForce 600 series cards.  The software beta for ShadowPlay, however, experienced multiple delays and would not be released until the end of October 2013.  A week after the release of the GTX&nbsp;780, Nvidia announced the GTX&nbsp;770 to be a rebrand of the GTX&nbsp;680.  It was followed by the GTX&nbsp;760 shortly after, which was also based on the GK104 core and similar to the GTX 660 Ti.  No more 700 series cards were set for release in 2013, although Nvidia announced G-Sync, another feature of the Kepler architecture that Nvidia had left unmentioned, which allowed the GPU to dynamically control the refresh rate of G-Sync-compatible monitors which would release in 2014, to combat tearing and judder.  However, in October, AMD released the R9&nbsp;290X, which came in at $100 less than the GTX&nbsp;780. In response, Nvidia slashed the price of the GTX&nbsp;780 by $150 and released the GTX&nbsp;780&nbsp;Ti, which featured a full 2880-core GK110 core even more powerful than the GTX TITAN, along with enhancements to the power delivery system which improved overclocking, and managed to pull ahead of AMD's new release.\n\nThe GeForce 800M series consists of rebranded 700M series parts based on the Kepler architecture and some lower-end parts based on the newer Maxwell architecture.\n\n=== GeForce 900 series ===\n{{Main|GeForce 900 series}}\n\nIn March 2013, Nvidia announced that the successor to Kepler would be the [[Maxwell (microarchitecture)|Maxwell microarchitecture]].<ref name=\"AnandTech_roadmap2013\">{{cite web | url = http://www.anandtech.com/show/6846/nvidia-updates-gpu-roadmap-announces-volta-family-for-beyond-2014 | title = NVIDIA Updates GPU Roadmap; Announces Volta Family For Beyond 2014 | last = Smith | first = Ryan | date = March 19, 2013 | publisher = AnandTech | accessdate = March 19, 2013 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130321035037/http://www.anandtech.com/show/6846/nvidia-updates-gpu-roadmap-announces-volta-family-for-beyond-2014 | archivedate = March 21, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> It was released in September 2014.

First performed in 1610 by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], it is generally considered Jonson's best and most characteristic comedy; [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] considered it had one of the three most perfect plots in literature. The play's clever fulfilment of the [[classical unities]] and vivid depiction of human folly have made it one of the few Renaissance plays (except the works of [[Shakespeare]]) with a continuing life on stage (except for a period of neglect during the Victorian era).\n\n==Background==\n''The Alchemist'' premiered 34 years after the first permanent public theatre ([[The Theatre]]) opened in London; it is, then, a product of the early maturity of commercial drama in London. Only one of the [[University Wit]]s who had transformed drama in the Elizabethan period remained alive (this was [[Thomas Lodge]]); in the other direction, the last great playwright to flourish before the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]], [[James Shirley]], was already a teenager. The theatres had survived the challenge mounted by the city and religious authorities; plays were a regular feature of life at court and for a great number of Londoners.\n\nThe venue for which Jonson apparently wrote his play reflects this newly solid acceptance of theatre as a fact of city life. In 1597, the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] (a.k.a. the King's Men) had been denied permission to use the theatre in [[Blackfriars Theatre|Blackfriars]] as a winter playhouse because of objections from the neighbourhood's influential residents. Some time between 1608 and 1610, the company, now the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], reassumed control of the playhouse, this time without objections. Their delayed premiere on this stage within the city walls, along with royal patronage, marks the ascendance of this company in the London play-world (Gurr, 171). ''The Alchemist'' was among the first plays chosen for performance at the theatre.\n\nJonson's play reflects this new confidence. In it, he applies his classical conception of drama to a setting in contemporary London for the first time, with invigorating results. The classical elements, most notably the relation between Lovewit and Face, are fully modernised; likewise, the depiction of Jacobean London is given order and direction by the classical understanding of comedy as a means to expose vice and foolishness to ridicule.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAn outbreak of plague in London forces a gentleman, Lovewit, to flee temporarily to the country, leaving his house under the sole charge of his butler, Jeremy. Jeremy uses the opportunity given to him to use the house as the headquarters for fraudulent acts. He transforms himself into \"Captain Face,\" and enlists the aid of Subtle, a fellow conman, and Dol Common, a prostitute.\n\nThe play opens with a violent argument between Subtle and Face concerning the division of the riches which they have, and will continue to gather. Face threatens to have an engraving made of Subtle with a face worse than that of the notorious highwayman [[Gamaliel Ratsey]]. Dol breaks the pair apart and reasons with them that they must work as a team if they are to succeed. Their first customer is Dapper, a lawyer's clerk who wishes Subtle to use his supposed necromantic skills to summon a \"familiar\" or spirit to help in his gambling ambitions. The tripartite suggest that Dapper may win favour with the \"Queen of Fairy,\" but he must subject himself to humiliating rituals in order for her to help him. Their second gull is Drugger, a tobacconist, who is keen to establish a profitable business. After this, a wealthy nobleman, Sir Epicure Mammon, arrives, expressing the desire to gain himself the [[philosopher's stone]], which he believes will bring him huge material and spiritual wealth. He is accompanied by Surly, a sceptic and debunker of the whole idea of [[alchemy]]. He is promised the philosopher's stone and promised that it will turn all base metal into gold. Surly however, suspects Subtle of being a thief. Mammon accidentally sees Dol and is told that she is a Lord's sister who is suffering from madness. Subtle contrives to become angry with Ananias, an [[Anabaptist]], and demands that he should return with a more senior member of his sect (Tribulation). Drugger returns and is given false and ludicrous advice about setting up his shop; he also brings news that a rich young widow (Dame Pliant) and her brother (Kastril) have arrived in London. Both Subtle and Face in their greed and ambition seek out to win the widow.\n\nThe Anabaptists return and agree to pay for goods to be transmuted into gold. These are in fact Mammon's goods. Dapper returns and is promised that he shall meet with the Queen of Fairy soon. Drugger brings Kastril who, on being told that Subtle is a skilled match-maker, rushes to fetch his sister. Drugger is given to understand that the appropriate payment might secure his marriage to the widow. Dapper is blindfolded and subjected to 'fairy' humiliations; but on the reappearance of Mammon, he is gagged and hastily thrust into the privy. Mammon is introduced to Dol. He has been told that Dol is a nobleman's sister who has gone mad, but he is not put off, and pays her extravagant compliments. Kastril and his sister come again. Kastril is given a lesson in quarrelling, and the widow captivates both Face and Subtle. They quarrel over who is to have her.\n\nSurly returns, disguised as a Spanish nobleman. Face and Subtle believe that the Spaniard speaks no English and they insult him. They also believe that he has come for a woman, but Dol is elsewhere in the building 'engaged' with Mammon, so Face has the inspiration of using Dame Pliant. She is reluctant to become a Spanish countess but is vigorously persuaded by her brother to go off with Surly. The tricksters need to get rid of Mammon. Dol contrives a fit and there is an 'explosion' from the 'laboratory'. In addition, the lady's furious brother is hunting for Mammon, who leaves. Surly reveals his true identity to Dame Pliant and hopes that she will look on him favourably as a consequence. Surly reveals his true identity to Face and Subtle, and denounces them. In quick succession Kastril, Drugger and Ananias return, and are set on Surly, who retreats. Drugger is told to go and find a Spanish costume if he is to have a chance of claiming the widow. Dol brings news that the master of the house has returned.\n\nLovewit's neighbours tell him that his house had many visitors during his absence. Face is now the plausible Jeremy again, and denies the accusation\u2014-he has kept the house locked up because of the plague. Surly, Mammon, Kastril and the Anabaptists return. There is a cry from the privy; Dapper has chewed through his gag. Jeremy can no longer maintain his fiction. He promises Lovewit that if he pardons him, he will help him obtain himself a rich widow (i.e., Dame Pliant). Dapper meets the \"Queen of Fairy\" and departs happily. Drugger delivers the Spanish costume and is sent to find a parson. Face tells Subtle and Dol that he has confessed to Lovewit, and that officers are on the way; Subtle and Dol have to flee, empty handed.\n\nThe victims come back again. Lovewit has married the widow and claimed Mammon's goods; Surly and Mammon depart disconsolately. The Anabaptists and Drugger are summarily dismissed. Kastril accepts his sister's marriage to Lovewit.  Lovewit pays tribute to the ingenuity of his servant, and Face asks for the audience's forgiveness.\n\n==Analysis==\n\nIn ''The Alchemist'', Jonson unashamedly satirises the follies, vanities and vices of mankind, most notably greed-induced credulity. People of all social classes are subject to Jonson's ruthless, satirical wit. He mocks human weakness and gullibility to advertising and to \"miracle cures\" with the character of Sir Epicure Mammon, who dreams of drinking the [[Fountain of Youth|elixir of youth]] and enjoying fantastic sexual conquests.\n\n''The Alchemist'' focuses on what happens when one human being seeks advantage over another. In a big city like London, this process of advantage-seeking is rife. The trio of con-artists \u2013 Subtle, Face and Doll \u2013 are self-deluding small-timers, ultimately undone by the same human weaknesses they exploit in their victims. Their fate is foreshadowed in the play's opening scene, which features them together in the house of Lovewit, Face's master. In a metaphor which runs through the play, the dialogue shows them to exist in uneasy imbalance, like alchemical elements that will create an unstable reaction. Barely ten lines into the text, Face and Subtle's quarrelling forces Doll to quell their raised voices: \u201cWill you have the neighbours hear you?  Will you betray all?\u201d\n\nThe con-artists' vanities and aspirations are revealed by the very personae they assume as part of their plan.  The lowly housekeeper, Face, casts himself as a [[sea captain]] (a man accustomed to giving orders, instead of taking them), the egotistical Subtle casts himself as an alchemist (as one who can do what no one else can; turn base metal into gold), and Dol Common casts herself as an aristocratic lady. Their incessant bickering is fuelled by vanity, envy and jealousy, the root of which is Subtle's conviction that he is the key element in the \u2018venture tripartite\u2019:\n\n:FACE: \u2018Tis his fault.  He ever murmurs and objects his pains, and says the weight of all lies upon him.\n\nThe \u2018venture tripartite\u2019 is as doomed as one of the Roman [[triumvirate]]s. The play's end sees Subtle and Dol resume their original pairing, while Face resumes his role as housekeeper to a wealthy master. Significantly, none of the three is severely punished (the collapse of their scheme aside). Jonson's theatrical microcosm is not a neatly moral one; and he seems to enjoy seeing foolish characters like Epicure Mammon get their comeuppance. This is why, while London itself is a target of Jonson's satire, it is also, as his Prologue boasts, a cozening-ground worth celebrating: \u201cOur scene is London, \u2018cause we would make known/No country\u2019s mirth is better than our own/No clime breeds better matter for your whore...\u201d\n\n''The Alchemist'' is tightly structured, based around a simple dramatic concept.  Subtle claims to be on the verge of [[Projection (alchemy)|projection]] in his offstage workroom, but all the characters in the play are overly-concerned with projection of a different kind: image-projection.  The end result, in structural terms, is an onstage base of operations in Friars, to which can be brought a succession of unconsciously-comic characters from different social backgrounds, who hold different professions and different beliefs, but whose lowest common denominator \u2013 gullibility \u2013 grants them equal victim-status in the end.  Dapper, the aspirant gambler, loses his stake; Sir Epicure Mammon loses his money and his dignity; Drugger, the would-be businessman, parts with his cash, but ends up no nearer to the success he craves; the Puritan duo, Tribulation and Ananias, never realise their scheme to counterfeit Dutch money.\n\nJonson reserves his harshest satire for these Puritan characters\u2014perhaps because the Puritans, in real life, wished to close down the theatres{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}. (Jonson's play ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]'' is also anti-Puritan.) Tellingly, of all those gulled in the play, it is the Puritans alone whom Jonson denies a brief moment of his audience's pity; presumably, he reckons their life-denying self-righteousness renders them unworthy of it. Jonson consistently despises hypocrisy, especially religious hypocrisy that couches its damning judgments in high-flown language. Tribulation and Ananias call their fellow men \"heathens\" and in one case, say that someone's hat suggests \"the Anti-Christ.\"  That these Puritans are just as money-hungry as the rest of the characters is part of the ironic joke.\n\nIn many English and European comedies, it is up to a high-class character to resolve the confusion that has been caused by lower-class characters. In ''The Alchemist,'' Jonson subverts this tradition. Face's master, Lovewit, at first seems to assert his social and ethical superiority to put matters to rights. But when Face dangles before him the prospect of marriage to a younger woman, his master eagerly accepts. Both master and servant are always on the lookout for how to get ahead in life, regardless of ethical boundaries. Lovewit adroitly exploits Mammon's reluctance to obtain legal certification of his folly to hold on to the old man's money.\n\n==Stage history==\n[[Image:Globe taylor.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A scene from a Los Angeles theatre production]]\nInternal references indicate that the play was written for performance at Blackfriars; ironically, given its initial scenario, plague forced the company to tour, and ''The Alchemist'' premiered at Oxford in 1610, with performance in London later that year. Its success may be indicated by its performance at court in 1613 and again in 1623. Evidence of a more ambiguous kind is presented by the case of [[Thomas Tomkis]]'s ''Albumazar'', performed for [[James I of England|King James I]] at [[Cambridge]] in 1615. A tradition apparently originating with [[John Dryden|Dryden]] held that Jonson had been influenced by Tomkis's academic comedy. Dryden may have mentioned Jonson to increase interest in a somewhat obscure play he was then reviving; he may also have been confused about the dates. At any rate, the question of influence now runs the other way. ''Albumazar'' is, primarily, an adaptation of [[Giambattista della Porta]]'s \"L'Astrologo\"; however, both the similarity in subject matter and Tomkis's apparent familiarity with commercial dramaturgy make it possible that he was aware of ''The Alchemist'', and may have been responding to the play's success.\n\nThe play continued onstage as a [[droll]] during the Commonwealth period; after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], it belonged to the repertory of the King's Men of [[Thomas Killigrew]], who appear to have performed it with some frequency during their first years in operation. The play is not known to have been performed between 1675 and 1709, but the frequency of performance after 1709 suggests that it probably was. Indeed, the play was frequently performed during the eighteenth century; both [[Colley Cibber]] and [[David Garrick]] were notable successes in the role of Drugger, for whom a small amount of new material, including farces and monologues, in the latter half of the century was created.\n\nAfter this period of flourishing, the play fell into desuetude, along with nearly all non-Shakespearean Renaissance drama, until the beginning of the twentieth century. [[William Poel]]'s [[Elizabethan Stage Society]] produced the play in 1899. This opening was followed a generation later by productions at [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]] in 1932, with [[Ralph Richardson]] as Face, and at the [[Old Vic]] in 1947. In the latter production, [[Alec Guinness]] played Drugger, alongside Richardson as Face.\n\nThe [[Oregon Shakespeare Festival]] staged a fast-paced, nearly farcical production in 1961; Gerard Larson played Face, and Nagle Jackson Face,{{clarify|date=August 2014}} under Edward Brubaker's direction. The performance received generally favourable reviews; however, a 1973 production set in the [[American Old West|Wild West]] setting did not; the setting was generally considered inconsistent with the tone and treatment of the play.\n\nIn 1962, [[Tyrone Guthrie]] produced a modernised version at the Old Vic, with [[Leo McKern]] as Subtle and [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]] as Mammon. [[Trevor Nunn]]'s 1977 production with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] featured [[Ian McKellen]] as a \"greasy, misanthropic\" Face, in a version adapted by [[Peter Barnes (playwright)|Peter Barnes]]. The original was played at the [[Royal National Theatre]], with [[Alex Jennings]] and [[Simon Russell Beale]] in the central roles, from September to November 2006. A contemporary dress production directed by [[Michael Kahn (theatre director)|Michael Kahn]] opened the 2009/2010 season at the [[Shakespeare Theatre Company]] in Washington, DC.

First performed in 1610 by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], it is generally considered Jonson's best and most characteristic comedy; [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] considered it had one of the three most perfect plots in literature. The play's clever fulfilment of the [[classical unities]] and vivid depiction of human folly have made it one of the few Renaissance plays (except the works of [[Shakespeare]]) with a continuing life on stage (except for a period of neglect during the Victorian era).\n\n==Background==\n''The Alchemist'' premiered 34 years after the first permanent public theatre ([[The Theatre]]) opened in London; it is, then, a product of the early maturity of commercial drama in London. Only one of the [[University Wit]]s who had transformed drama in the Elizabethan period remained alive (this was [[Thomas Lodge]]); in the other direction, the last great playwright to flourish before the [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]], [[James Shirley]], was already a teenager. The theatres had survived the challenge mounted by the city and religious authorities; plays were a regular feature of life at court and for a great number of Londoners.\n\nThe venue for which Jonson apparently wrote his play reflects this newly solid acceptance of theatre as a fact of city life. In 1597, the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] (a.k.a. the King's Men) had been denied permission to use the theatre in [[Blackfriars Theatre|Blackfriars]] as a winter playhouse because of objections from the neighbourhood's influential residents. Some time between 1608 and 1610, the company, now the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], reassumed control of the playhouse, this time without objections. Their delayed premiere on this stage within the city walls, along with royal patronage, marks the ascendance of this company in the London play-world (Gurr, 171). ''The Alchemist'' was among the first plays chosen for performance at the theatre.\n\nJonson's play reflects this new confidence. In it, he applies his classical conception of drama to a setting in contemporary London for the first time, with invigorating results. The classical elements, most notably the relation between Lovewit and Face, are fully modernised; likewise, the depiction of Jacobean London is given order and direction by the classical understanding of comedy as a means to expose vice and foolishness to ridicule.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAn outbreak of plague in London forces a gentleman, Lovewit, to flee temporarily to the country, leaving his house under the sole charge of his butler, Jeremy. Jeremy uses the opportunity given to him to use the house as the headquarters for fraudulent acts. He transforms himself into \"Captain Face,\" and enlists the aid of Subtle, a fellow conman, and Dol Common, a prostitute.\n\nThe play opens with a violent argument between Subtle and Face concerning the division of the riches which they have, and will continue to gather. Face threatens to have an engraving made of Subtle with a face worse than that of the notorious highwayman [[Gamaliel Ratsey]]. Dol breaks the pair apart and reasons with them that they must work as a team if they are to succeed. Their first customer is Dapper, a lawyer's clerk who wishes Subtle to use his supposed necromantic skills to summon a \"familiar\" or spirit to help in his gambling ambitions. The tripartite suggest that Dapper may win favour with the \"Queen of Fairy,\" but he must subject himself to humiliating rituals in order for her to help him. Their second gull is Drugger, a tobacconist, who is keen to establish a profitable business. After this, a wealthy nobleman, Sir Epicure Mammon, arrives, expressing the desire to gain himself the [[philosopher's stone]], which he believes will bring him huge material and spiritual wealth. He is accompanied by Surly, a sceptic and debunker of the whole idea of [[alchemy]]. He is promised the philosopher's stone and promised that it will turn all base metal into gold. Surly however, suspects Subtle of being a thief. Mammon accidentally sees Dol and is told that she is a Lord's sister who is suffering from madness. Subtle contrives to become angry with Ananias, an [[Anabaptist]], and demands that he should return with a more senior member of his sect (Tribulation). Drugger returns and is given false and ludicrous advice about setting up his shop; he also brings news that a rich young widow (Dame Pliant) and her brother (Kastril) have arrived in London. Both Subtle and Face in their greed and ambition seek out to win the widow.\n\nThe Anabaptists return and agree to pay for goods to be transmuted into gold. These are in fact Mammon's goods. Dapper returns and is promised that he shall meet with the Queen of Fairy soon. Drugger brings Kastril who, on being told that Subtle is a skilled match-maker, rushes to fetch his sister. Drugger is given to understand that the appropriate payment might secure his marriage to the widow. Dapper is blindfolded and subjected to 'fairy' humiliations; but on the reappearance of Mammon, he is gagged and hastily thrust into the privy. Mammon is introduced to Doll. He has been told that Dol is a nobleman's sister who has gone mad, but he is not put off, and pays her extravagant compliments. Kastril and his sister come again. Kastril is given a lesson in quarrelling, and the widow captivates both Face and Subtle. They quarrel over who is to have her.\n\nSurly returns, disguised as a Spanish nobleman. Face and Subtle believe that the Spaniard speaks no English and they insult him. They also believe that he has come for a woman, but Dol is elsewhere in the building 'engaged' with Mammon, so Face has the inspiration of using Dame Pliant. She is reluctant to become a Spanish countess but is vigorously persuaded by her brother to go off with Surly. The tricksters need to get rid of Mammon. Dol contrives a fit and there is an 'explosion' from the 'laboratory'. In addition, the lady's furious brother is hunting for Mammon, who leaves. Surly reveals his true identity to Dame Pliant and hopes that she will look on him favourably as a consequence. Surly reveals his true identity to Face and Subtle, and denounces them. In quick succession Kastril, Drugger and Ananias return, and are set on Surly, who retreats. Drugger is told to go and find a Spanish costume if he is to have a chance of claiming the widow. Dol brings news that the master of the house has returned.\n\nLovewit's neighbours tell him that his house had many visitors during his absence. Face is now the plausible Jeremy again, and denies the accusation\u2014-he has kept the house locked up because of the plague. Surly, Mammon, Kastril and the Anabaptists return. There is a cry from the privy; Dapper has chewed through his gag. Jeremy can no longer maintain his fiction. He promises Lovewit that if he pardons him, he will help him obtain himself a rich widow (i.e., Dame Pliant). Dapper meets the \"Queen of Fairy\" and departs happily. Drugger delivers the Spanish costume and is sent to find a parson. Face tells Subtle and Dol that he has confessed to Lovewit, and that officers are on the way; Subtle and Dol have to flee, empty handed.\n\nThe victims come back again. Lovewit has married the widow and claimed Mammon's goods; Surly and Mammon depart disconsolately. The Anabaptists and Drugger are summarily dismissed. Kastril accepts his sister's marriage to Lovewit.  Lovewit pays tribute to the ingenuity of his servant, and Face asks for the audience's forgiveness.\n\n==Analysis==\n\nIn ''The Alchemist'', Jonson unashamedly satirises the follies, vanities and vices of mankind, most notably greed-induced credulity. People of all social classes are subject to Jonson's ruthless, satirical wit. He mocks human weakness and gullibility to advertising and to \"miracle cures\" with the character of Sir Epicure Mammon, who dreams of drinking the [[Fountain of Youth|elixir of youth]] and enjoying fantastic sexual conquests.\n\n''The Alchemist'' focuses on what happens when one human being seeks advantage over another. In a big city like London, this process of advantage-seeking is rife. The trio of con-artists \u2013 Subtle, Face and Doll \u2013 are self-deluding small-timers, ultimately undone by the same human weaknesses they exploit in their victims. Their fate is foreshadowed in the play's opening scene, which features them together in the house of Lovewit, Face's master. In a metaphor which runs through the play, the dialogue shows them to exist in uneasy imbalance, like alchemical elements that will create an unstable reaction. Barely ten lines into the text, Face and Subtle's quarrelling forces Doll to quell their raised voices: \u201cWill you have the neighbours hear you?  Will you betray all?\u201d\n\nThe con-artists' vanities and aspirations are revealed by the very personae they assume as part of their plan.  The lowly housekeeper, Face, casts himself as a [[sea captain]] (a man accustomed to giving orders, instead of taking them), the egotistical Subtle casts himself as an alchemist (as one who can do what no one else can; turn base metal into gold), and Dol Common casts herself as an aristocratic lady. Their incessant bickering is fuelled by vanity, envy and jealousy, the root of which is Subtle's conviction that he is the key element in the \u2018venture tripartite\u2019:\n\n:FACE: \u2018Tis his fault.  He ever murmurs and objects his pains, and says the weight of all lies upon him.\n\nThe \u2018venture tripartite\u2019 is as doomed as one of the Roman [[triumvirate]]s. The play's end sees Subtle and Dol resume their original pairing, while Face resumes his role as housekeeper to a wealthy master. Significantly, none of the three is severely punished (the collapse of their scheme aside). Jonson's theatrical microcosm is not a neatly moral one; and he seems to enjoy seeing foolish characters like Epicure Mammon get their comeuppance. This is why, while London itself is a target of Jonson's satire, it is also, as his Prologue boasts, a cozening-ground worth celebrating: \u201cOur scene is London, \u2018cause we would make known/No country\u2019s mirth is better than our own/No clime breeds better matter for your whore...\u201d\n\n''The Alchemist'' is tightly structured, based around a simple dramatic concept.  Subtle claims to be on the verge of [[Projection (alchemy)|projection]] in his offstage workroom, but all the characters in the play are overly-concerned with projection of a different kind: image-projection.  The end result, in structural terms, is an onstage base of operations in Friars, to which can be brought a succession of unconsciously-comic characters from different social backgrounds, who hold different professions and different beliefs, but whose lowest common denominator \u2013 gullibility \u2013 grants them equal victim-status in the end.  Dapper, the aspirant gambler, loses his stake; Sir Epicure Mammon loses his money and his dignity; Drugger, the would-be businessman, parts with his cash, but ends up no nearer to the success he craves; the Puritan duo, Tribulation and Ananias, never realise their scheme to counterfeit Dutch money.\n\nJonson reserves his harshest satire for these Puritan characters\u2014perhaps because the Puritans, in real life, wished to close down the theatres{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}. (Jonson's play ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]'' is also anti-Puritan.) Tellingly, of all those gulled in the play, it is the Puritans alone whom Jonson denies a brief moment of his audience's pity; presumably, he reckons their life-denying self-righteousness renders them unworthy of it. Jonson consistently despises hypocrisy, especially religious hypocrisy that couches its damning judgments in high-flown language. Tribulation and Ananias call their fellow men \"heathens\" and in one case, say that someone's hat suggests \"the Anti-Christ.\"  That these Puritans are just as money-hungry as the rest of the characters is part of the ironic joke.\n\nIn many English and European comedies, it is up to a high-class character to resolve the confusion that has been caused by lower-class characters. In ''The Alchemist,'' Jonson subverts this tradition. Face's master, Lovewit, at first seems to assert his social and ethical superiority to put matters to rights. But when Face dangles before him the prospect of marriage to a younger woman, his master eagerly accepts. Both master and servant are always on the lookout for how to get ahead in life, regardless of ethical boundaries. Lovewit adroitly exploits Mammon's reluctance to obtain legal certification of his folly to hold on to the old man's money.\n\n==Stage history==\n[[Image:Globe taylor.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A scene from a Los Angeles theatre production]]\nInternal references indicate that the play was written for performance at Blackfriars; ironically, given its initial scenario, plague forced the company to tour, and ''The Alchemist'' premiered at Oxford in 1610, with performance in London later that year. Its success may be indicated by its performance at court in 1613 and again in 1623. Evidence of a more ambiguous kind is presented by the case of [[Thomas Tomkis]]'s ''Albumazar'', performed for [[James I of England|King James I]] at [[Cambridge]] in 1615. A tradition apparently originating with [[John Dryden|Dryden]] held that Jonson had been influenced by Tomkis's academic comedy. Dryden may have mentioned Jonson to increase interest in a somewhat obscure play he was then reviving; he may also have been confused about the dates. At any rate, the question of influence now runs the other way. ''Albumazar'' is, primarily, an adaptation of [[Giambattista della Porta]]'s \"L'Astrologo\"; however, both the similarity in subject matter and Tomkis's apparent familiarity with commercial dramaturgy make it possible that he was aware of ''The Alchemist'', and may have been responding to the play's success.\n\nThe play continued onstage as a [[droll]] during the Commonwealth period; after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], it belonged to the repertory of the King's Men of [[Thomas Killigrew]], who appear to have performed it with some frequency during their first years in operation.
