The Council is its top executive body, supervising the activities of the nineteen specialized International Commissions and the four Affiliated Commissions \u2013 it typically meets once or twice per year. The Union is composed of Members representing identified physics communities. At present 60 Members adhere to IUPAP. The Members are represented by Liaison Committees.  Members of the Council and Commissions are elected by the General Assembly, based on nominations received from Liaison Committees and existing Council and Commission members.\n\n'''The IUPAP specialised Commissions are:'''\n\nC1.

[https://iupap.org/commissions/affiliated-commissions/ac4-international-commission-on-medical-physics/ International Commission on Medical Physics]\n\nIn addition IUPAP has established a number of Working Groups to provide an overview of important areas of international collaboration in physics.\n\n== Sponsored conferences ==\nEach year, IUPAP endorses approximately 30 international conferences and awards grants to the majority of them. Applications for sponsorship can be made via the IUPAP website.\n\nSponsored conferences fall into four categories:\n\n'''General Conferences - Type A'''\n\nThese provide a broad overview of an entire field (typically the field of interest to a Commission), and normally occur at two- or three-year intervals, as advances in the field warrant. Attendance in the range of 750-1000 would be anticipated.\n\n'''Topical Conferences - Type B'''\n\nThese concentrate on broad sub-fields (e.g. nuclear spectroscopy, nuclear reaction mechanisms, heavy ion physics, are possible sub-fields in the field of Nuclear Physics). They would normally be scheduled in the years between the corresponding Type A General conferences. Attendance in the range of 300-600 would be anticipated.\n\n'''Special Conferences - Type C'''\n\nThese concentrate on much more specialised topics than in the case of Type B Conferences (e.g. angular correlations, lifetime measurements, neutron resonance studies in the field of Nuclear Physics). Attendance in the range of 50-200 would be anticipated.\n\n'''Workshops in Developing Countries - Type D'''\n\nThese concentrate on meeting the needs of a developing region. Unlike the Type A, B and C conferences, they do not need to be truly international, but should involve neighbouring countries, and they should address the needs of the region. One Type D conference will be approved each year. All applications for Type-D Conferences must be submitted to the Commission on Physics for Development (C13).\n\n== Sponsored awards ==\nIUPAP commissions sponsor various awards for scientists. These include:\n\n* The IUPAP Young Scientist Prize, approved and adopted at the 2005 General Assembly for all commissions.\n* The SUNAMCO Medal, given by the Commission on Symbols, Units, Nomenclature, Atomic Masses and Fundamental Constants (C2) \n* The Boltzmann Medal, awarded by the Commission on Statistical Physics (C3) \n* The Fritz London Award, given by the Commission on Low Temperature Physics (C5)  \n* The Young Author Best Paper Award, established by the Commission on Semiconductors (C8) and sponsored by the semiconductor industries of USA, Japan and Europe \n* ICM Award in Magnetism, established by the Commission on Magnetism (C9) \n* The ICPE Medal, sponsored by the Commission on Physics Education (C14) \n* Penning Award Excellence in Low-Temperature Plasma Physics, established by the Commission on Plasma Physics (C16)\n* ICO Prize, awarded by the Affiliated Commission for Optics (AC1)  \n* ICO Galileo Galilei Award, awarded by the Affiliated Commission for Optics (AC1)\n\n== Sponsored symposiums==\n* [[Symposium on Laser Physics]]\n\n==List of IUPAP presidents==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!Term\n!President\n!Country\n|-\n|1922\u20131931\n|[[William Henry Bragg|Sir William Bragg]]<ref name=\"Nilsson1996\"></ref>\n|{{flag|United Kingdom}}\n|-\n|1931\u20131934\n|[[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert Millikan]]<ref name=\"BacherHavens1972\"></ref>\n|{{flag|USA}}\n|-\n|1934\u20131947\n|[[Manne Siegbahn]]<ref name=\"IUPAP50\"></ref>\n|{{flag|Sweden}}\n|-\n|1947\u20131951\n|[[Hans Kramers]]<ref name=\"Wheeler1951\">{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John A.|title=7th IUPAP Assembly|journal=Physics Today|volume=4|issue=11|year=1951|pages=30\u201333|issn=0031-9228|doi=10.1063/1.3067089}}</ref> \n|{{flag|Netherlands}}\n|-\n|1951\u20131957\n|[[Neville Francis Mott]]<ref name=\"Slater1952\">{{cite journal|last1=Slater|first1=J.

The Council is its top executive body, supervising the activities of the nineteen specialized International Commissions and the four Affiliated Commissions \u2013 it typically meets once or twice per year. The Union is composed of Members representing identified physics communities. At present 60 Members adhere to IUPAP. The Members are represented by Liaison Committees.  Members of the Council and Commissions are elected by the General Assembly, based on nominations received from Liaison Committees and existing Council and Commission members.\n\n'''The IUPAP specialised Commissions are:'''\n\nC1.

[https://iupap.org/commissions/affiliated-commissions/ac4-international-commission-on-medical-physics/ International Commission on Medical Physics]\n\nIn addition IUPAP has established a number of Working Groups to provide an overview of important areas of international collaboration in physics.\n\n== Sponsored conferences ==\nEach year, IUPAP endorses approximately 30 international conferences and awards grants to the majority of them. Applications for sponsorship can be made via the IUPAP website.\n\nSponsored conferences fall into four categories:\n\n'''General Conferences - Type A'''\n\nThese provide a broad overview of an entire field (typically the field of interest to a Commission), and normally occur at two- or three-year intervals, as advances in the field warrant. Attendance in the range of 750-1000 would be anticipated.\n\n'''Topical Conferences - Type B'''\n\nThese concentrate on broad sub-fields (e.g. nuclear spectroscopy, nuclear reaction mechanisms, heavy ion physics, are possible sub-fields in the field of Nuclear Physics). They would normally be scheduled in the years between the corresponding Type A General conferences. Attendance in the range of 300-600 would be anticipated.\n\n'''Special Conferences - Type C'''\n\nThese concentrate on much more specialised topics than in the case of Type B Conferences (e.g. angular correlations, lifetime measurements, neutron resonance studies in the field of Nuclear Physics). Attendance in the range of 50-200 would be anticipated.\n\n'''Workshops in Developing Countries - Type D'''\n\nThese concentrate on meeting the needs of a developing region. Unlike the Type A, B and C conferences, they do not need to be truly international, but should involve neighbouring countries, and they should address the needs of the region. One Type D conference will be approved each year. All applications for Type-D Conferences must be submitted to the Commission on Physics for Development (C13).\n\n== Sponsored awards ==\nIUPAP commissions sponsor various awards for scientists. These include:\n\n* The IUPAP Young Scientist Prize, approved and adopted at the 2005 General Assembly for all commissions.\n* The SUNAMCO Medal, given by the Commission on Symbols, Units, Nomenclature, Atomic Masses and Fundamental Constants (C2) \n* The Boltzmann Medal, awarded by the Commission on Statistical Physics (C3) \n* The Fritz London Award, given by the Commission on Low Temperature Physics (C5)  \n* The Young Author Best Paper Award, established by the Commission on Semiconductors (C8) and sponsored by the semiconductor industries of USA, Japan and Europe \n* ICM Award in Magnetism, established by the Commission on Magnetism (C9) \n* The ICPE Medal, sponsored by the Commission on Physics Education (C14) \n* Penning Award Excellence in Low-Temperature Plasma Physics, established by the Commission on Plasma Physics (C16)\n* ICO Prize, awarded by the Affiliated Commission for Optics (AC1)  \n* ICO Galileo Galilei Award, awarded by the Affiliated Commission for Optics (AC1)\n\n== Sponsored symposiums==\n* [[Symposium on Laser Physics]]\n\n==List of IUPAP presidents==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n|-\n!Term\n!President\n!Country\n|-\n|1922\u20131931\n|[[William Henry Bragg|Sir William Bragg]]<ref name=\"Nilsson1996\"></ref>\n|{{flag|United Kingdom}}\n|-\n|1931\u20131934\n|[[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert Millikan]]<ref name=\"BacherHavens1972\"></ref>\n|{{flag|USA}}\n|-\n|1934\u20131947\n|[[Manne Siegbahn]]<ref name=\"IUPAP50\"></ref>\n|{{flag|Sweden}}\n|-\n|1947\u20131951\n|[[Hans Kramers]]<ref name=\"Wheeler1951\">{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=John A.|title=7th IUPAP Assembly|journal=Physics Today|volume=4|issue=11|year=1951|pages=30\u201333|issn=0031-9228|doi=10.1063/1.3067089}}</ref> \n|{{flag|Netherlands}}\n|-\n|1951\u20131957\n|[[Neville Francis Mott]]<ref name=\"Slater1952\">{{cite journal|last1=Slater|first1=J.

When Sally took over the construction contract, the ship was lengthened from the original length of approximately {{convert|137|m|ft}} to approximately {{convert|155|m|ft}} and the superstructure of the ship was largely redesigned.<ref name=\"Vasab\u00e5tarna\" />\n\nMeyer Werft had constructed a large number of ships for various Viking Line partner companies during the 1970s. The construction of the [[Bow (ship)|ship's bow]] consisted of an upwards-opening [[Bow visor|visor]] and a car ramp that was placed inside the visor when it was closed. An identical bow construction had also been used in ''Diana II''.<ref group=\"JAIC\" name=\"11.3\"/>\n\n==Service history==\n\n''Estonia'' previously sailed as '''''Viking Sally''''' (1980\u20131990), '''''Silja Star''''' (1990\u20131991), and '''''Wasa King''''' (1991\u20131993).\n\n===Viking Line===\n[[File:Viking Sally 002.jpg|thumbnail|left|As MS ''Viking Sally'']]\nOn 29 June 1980 ''Viking Sally'' was delivered to Rederi Ab Sally, Finland and was put into service on the route between [[Turku]], [[Mariehamn]] and [[Stockholm]]<ref name=\"Vasab\u00e5tarna\" /><ref name=\"FoF\">{{cite web |title=M/S Viking Sally |url=http://www.faktaomfartyg.se/viking_sally_1980.htm |publisher=Fakta om Fartyg |language=Swedish |accessdate=29 October 2007 }}</ref> (during summer 1982 on the [[Naantali]]\u2013Mariehamn\u2013[[Kapellsk\u00e4r]] route).<ref>{{cite web |title=Viking Sally schedules 1980\u20131990 |url=http://www.fcbsweb.com/forum/index.php?topic=11464.0 |publisher=FCBS Forum |language=Finnish |accessdate=29 October 2007 }}</ref> She was the largest ship to serve on that route at the time.

''Estonia'' was on a scheduled crossing with departure at 18:30 on 27 September. She had been expected in Stockholm the next morning at about 09:30. She was carrying 989 people: 803 passengers and 186 crew.<ref>Whittingham, ''The Blame Machine'', p. 137</ref><ref group=\"JAIC\" name=\"7.6\"/> Most of the passengers were Swedish, although some were of Estonian origin, while most of the crew members were Estonian.

All scheduled passenger ferries were at sea. The official report says that while the exact speed at the time of the accident is not known, ''Estonia'' had very regular voyage times, averaging {{convert|16|to|17|kn}}. The [[chief mate]] of the [[Viking Line]] cruiseferry [[MS Mariella|''Mariella'']] tracked ''Estonia''{{'}}s speed by [[radar]] at approximately {{convert|14.2|kn}} before the first signs of distress, while the ''Silja Europa''{{'}}s officers estimated her speed at {{convert|14|to|15|kn}} at midnight.\n\nThe first sign of trouble aboard ''Estonia'' was when a metallic bang was heard, caused by a heavy wave hitting the bow doors around 01:00, when the ship was on the outskirts of the [[Islands of Turku|Turku archipelago]], but an inspection\u2014limited to checking the indicator lights for the ramp and [[bow visor|visor]]\u2014showed no problems.<ref name=Whittingham138/> Over the next 10 minutes, similar noises were reported by passengers and other crew.<ref name=Whittingham138/> At about 01:15, the visor separated in which the ship's bow door opened, and the ship immediately took on a heavy [[starboard]] list (initially around 15 degrees, but by 01:30, the ship had rolled 60 degrees and by 1:50 the list was 90 degrees) as water flooded into the vehicle deck.<ref name=Whittingham138/> ''Estonia'' was turned to port and slowed before her four engines cut out completely.<ref name=Whittingham138/>\n\nAt about 01:20, a quiet female voice called ''\"H\u00e4ire, h\u00e4ire, laeval on h\u00e4ire\"'', [[Estonian language|Estonian]] for \"Alarm, alarm, there is alarm on the ship\", over the public address system, which was followed immediately by an internal alarm for the crew, then one minute later by the general lifeboat alarm. The vessel's rapid list and the flooding prevented many people in the cabins from ascending to the boat deck, as water not only flooded the vessel via the car deck, but also through windows in cabins as well as the massive windows along deck 6. The windows gave way to the powerful waves as the ship listed and the sea reached the upper decks. Survivors reported that water flowed down from ceiling panels, stairwells and along corridors from decks that were not yet under water. This contributed to the rapid sinking.<ref name=Whittingham138/> A [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]] was communicated by the ship's crew at 01:22, but did not follow international formats. ''Estonia'' directed a call to ''Silja Europa'' and only after making contact with her did the radio operator utter the word \"Mayday\". The radio operator on ''Silja Europa'', chief mate Teijo Seppelin, replied in English: \"Estonia, are you calling mayday?\" After that, the voice of [[third mate]] Andres Tammes took over on ''Estonia'' and the conversation shifted to Finnish.<ref>{{cite web |title=Estonia final report. 2.1 The Distress Communication |url=http://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/estonia%20final%20report/chapter22.htm |publisher=estoniaferrydisaster.net |accessdate=24 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100702/http://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/estonia%20final%20report/chapter22.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Tammes was able to provide some details about their situation but, due to a loss of power, he could not give their position, which delayed rescue operations somewhat. Some minutes later, power returned (or somebody on the bridge managed to lower himself to the starboard side of the bridge to check the marine GPS, which will display the ship's position even in blackout conditions), and the ''Estonia'' was able to radio its position to ''Silja Europa'' and ''Mariella''. The ship disappeared from the radar screens of other ships at around 01:50,<ref name=Whittingham138/> and sank at {{Coord|59|23|N|21|42|E|}} in [[international waters]], about {{convert|22|nmi}} on bearing 157\u00b0 from [[Ut\u00f6, Finland|Ut\u00f6]] island, Finland, to the depth of {{convert|74|to|85|m}} of water. According to survivor accounts, the ship sank stern first after taking a list of 90 degrees.\n\n===Rescue effort===\nSearch and rescue followed arrangements set up under the 1979 International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (the SAR Convention), and the nearest Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre MRCC Turku coordinated the effort in accordance with Finland's plans. The Baltic is one of the world's busiest shipping areas, with 2,000 vessels at sea at any time, and these plans assumed the ship's own boats and nearby ferries would provide immediate help and that helicopters could be airborne after an hour. This scheme had worked for the relatively small number of accidents involving sinkings, particularly as most ships have few people on board.<ref>[http://www.helcom.fi/press_office/news_helcom/en_GB/Shipping_accidents2006/ HELCOM reports a noticeable drop in shipping accidents in the Baltic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227090327/http://www.helcom.fi/press_office/news_helcom/en_GB/Shipping_accidents2006/ |date=27 December 2007 }}.

''Estonia'' was on a scheduled crossing with departure at 18:30 on 27 September. She had been expected in Stockholm the next morning at about 09:30.

All scheduled passenger ferries were at sea. The official report says that while the exact speed at the time of the accident is not known, ''Estonia'' had very regular voyage times, averaging {{convert|16|to|17|kn}}. The [[chief mate]] of the [[Viking Line]] cruiseferry [[MS Mariella|''Mariella'']] tracked ''Estonia''{{'}}s speed by [[radar]] at approximately {{convert|14.2|kn}} before the first signs of distress, while the ''Silja Europa''{{'}}s officers estimated her speed at {{convert|14|to|15|kn}} at midnight.\n\nThe first sign of trouble aboard ''Estonia'' was when a metallic bang was heard, caused by a heavy wave hitting the bow doors around 01:00, when the ship was on the outskirts of the [[Islands of Turku|Turku archipelago]], but an inspection\u2014limited to checking the indicator lights for the ramp and [[bow visor|visor]]\u2014showed no problems.<ref name=Whittingham138/> Over the next 10 minutes, similar noises were reported by passengers and other crew.<ref name=Whittingham138/> At about 01:15, the visor separated in which the ship's bow door opened, and the ship immediately took on a heavy [[starboard]] list (initially around 15 degrees, but by 01:30, the ship had rolled 60 degrees and by 1:50 the list was 90 degrees) as water flooded into the vehicle deck.<ref name=Whittingham138/> ''Estonia'' was turned to port and slowed before her four engines cut out completely.<ref name=Whittingham138/>\n\nAt about 01:20, a quiet female voice called ''\"H\u00e4ire, h\u00e4ire, laeval on h\u00e4ire\"'', [[Estonian language|Estonian]] for \"Alarm, alarm, there is alarm on the ship\", over the public address system, which was followed immediately by an internal alarm for the crew, then one minute later by the general lifeboat alarm. The vessel's rapid list and the flooding prevented many people in the cabins from ascending to the boat deck, as water not only flooded the vessel via the car deck, but also through windows in cabins as well as the massive windows along deck 6. The windows gave way to the powerful waves as the ship listed and the sea reached the upper decks. Survivors reported that water flowed down from ceiling panels, stairwells and along corridors from decks that were not yet under water. This contributed to the rapid sinking.<ref name=Whittingham138/> A [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]] was communicated by the ship's crew at 01:22, but did not follow international formats. ''Estonia'' directed a call to ''Silja Europa'' and only after making contact with her did the radio operator utter the word \"Mayday\". The radio operator on ''Silja Europa'', chief mate Teijo Seppelin, replied in English: \"Estonia, are you calling mayday?\" After that, the voice of [[third mate]] Andres Tammes took over on ''Estonia'' and the conversation shifted to Finnish.<ref>{{cite web |title=Estonia final report. 2.1 The Distress Communication |url=http://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/estonia%20final%20report/chapter22.htm |publisher=estoniaferrydisaster.net |accessdate=24 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100702/http://www.estoniaferrydisaster.net/estonia%20final%20report/chapter22.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Tammes was able to provide some details about their situation but, due to a loss of power, he could not give their position, which delayed rescue operations somewhat. Some minutes later, power returned (or somebody on the bridge managed to lower himself to the starboard side of the bridge to check the marine GPS, which will display the ship's position even in blackout conditions), and the ''Estonia'' was able to radio its position to ''Silja Europa'' and ''Mariella''. The ship disappeared from the radar screens of other ships at around 01:50,<ref name=Whittingham138/> and sank at {{Coord|59|23|N|21|42|E|}} in [[international waters]], about {{convert|22|nmi}} on bearing 157\u00b0 from [[Ut\u00f6, Finland|Ut\u00f6]] island, Finland, to the depth of {{convert|74|to|85|m}} of water. According to survivor accounts, the ship sank stern first after taking a list of 90 degrees.\n\n===Rescue effort===\nSearch and rescue followed arrangements set up under the 1979 International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (the SAR Convention), and the nearest Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre MRCC Turku coordinated the effort in accordance with Finland's plans. The Baltic is one of the world's busiest shipping areas, with 2,000 vessels at sea at any time, and these plans assumed the ship's own boats and nearby ferries would provide immediate help and that helicopters could be airborne after an hour. This scheme had worked for the relatively small number of accidents involving sinkings, particularly as most ships have few people on board.<ref>[http://www.helcom.fi/press_office/news_helcom/en_GB/Shipping_accidents2006/ HELCOM reports a noticeable drop in shipping accidents in the Baltic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227090327/http://www.helcom.fi/press_office/news_helcom/en_GB/Shipping_accidents2006/ |date=27 December 2007 }}.

[[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place.

That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches and promoted to [[Serie A]] after 31 years in the lower divisions.\n\n==Squad==\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=1|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianluca Berti]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=2|nat=ITA|name=Paolo Cotroneo|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=''3''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Francesco Modesto]]''<ref>loaned out on Winter.</ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=4|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianluca Atzori]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=5|nat=ITA|name=[[Eugenio Corini]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=6|nat=ITA|name=[[Christian Terlizzi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=7|nat=ITA|name=[[Gaetano Vasari]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=8|nat=ITA|name=[[Daniele Di Donato]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=9|nat=ITA|name=[[Luca Toni]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=10|nat=ITA|name=[[Lamberto Zauli]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=11|nat=ITA|name=[[Salvatore Masiello]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=12|nat=ITA|name=[[Nicola Santoni]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=13|nat=ITA|name=[[Pietro Accardi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=''14''|nat=CMR|name=''[[Frank Oliver Ongfiang]]''<ref>Loaned out.</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=14|nat=ITA|name=Rocco D'Aiello|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=16|nat=ITA|name=Pietro Balistreri|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=17|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonino Asta]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=''18''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Franco Brienza]]''<ref> Loaned out</ref>|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=18|nat=ITA|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]<ref>Transfered In on Winter</ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=19|nat=ITA|name=Daniele Zito|pos=DF}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=20|nat=ITA|name=[[Simone Pepe]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=''21''|nat=ROU|name=''[[Paul Codrea]]''<ref>Loaned out.</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=21|nat=ITA|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]<ref>Transfered In </ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=22|nat=ITA|name=[[Massimo Mutarelli]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=''23''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Ighli Vannucchi]]''<ref>Loaned out.</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=23|nat=ITA|name=[[Emanuele Filippini]]<ref>Transfered In on Winter</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=24|nat=NGA|name=John Olufemi|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=25|nat=SLE|name=[[Kewullay Conteh]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=26|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonio Filippini]]<ref>Transfered In on Winter</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=27|nat=ITA|name=Michele Trionfante|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=29|nat=ROU|name=[[Valentin N\u0103stase]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=30|nat=BRA|name=[[Jeda]]<ref>Transfered In on Winter</ref>|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=32|nat=ITA|name=Marco Fina|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=46|nat=ITA|name=[[Andrea Gasbarroni]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=51|nat=ITA|name=Vincenzo Giannusa|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=79|nat=ITA|name=[[Evans Soligo]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=81|nat=ITA|name=[[Michele Ferri]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=82|nat=ITA|name=Nicola Milano|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=84|nat=ITA|name=Paolo Comi|pos=GK}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n===Transfers===\n<div style=\"float: left; width: 50%;\">\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;width:99%;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |In\n|-\n! width=3% |Pos.\n! width=33% |Name\n! width=28% |from\n! width=36% |Type\n|-\n|GK ||[[Gianluca Berti]] ||Empoli ||\n|-\n|GK ||Paolo Comi ||Monza ||\n|-\n|DF ||[[Michele Ferri]] ||[[A.C.

borough in [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States. The population was 7,002 at the 2010 census. Ridley Park is the home of [[The Boeing Company]]'s [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|CH-47 Chinook helicopter]] division.<ref>Bush campaign to tour Boeing's Army helicopter factory in Delco, Pa. The Philadelphia Inquirer (Philadelphia, PA)  August 17, 2004</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Native American===\nThe [[Lenape]] inhabited the [[Delaware River]] region several centuries before the arrival of European explorers and traders.  The [[Okehocking Tribe]] of the [[Lenni Lenape]] Nation established small permanent villages along the river and its main tributaries. Land adjacent to Stoney Creek in [[Ridley Township, Pennsylvania|Ridley Township]] has been identified as a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] town site. Historians also believe that additional villages may have existed at other locations along Stoney Creek and Crum Creek in Ridley Park.<ref name=\"Early Pennsylvania 1912\"/>\nNative Americans significantly influenced the built environment through their network of paths laid out for travel and communication purposes. Their footpaths through the densely forested countryside grew into the first roads of the area. Chester Pike is believed to have developed from a footpath created by the Lenni Lenape as their main thoroughfare in the area.<ref>A History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania, edited by John W. Jordan, LL. D., published by Lewis Historical Publishing Company, New York 1914</ref>\n\n===Colonial===\nThe  borough is named after a place in [[Cheshire]], England. [[John Morton (American politician)|John Morton]], signer of the [[American Declaration of Independence]], was born and raised in a log cabin adjacent to East Ridley Avenue. He later replaced the cabin with a brick house and began farming {{convert|133|acre|km2}} in the Ridley Park area.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Historic structures report: Joseph Pratt Farmhouse, Colonial Pennsylvania Plantation, Ridley Creek State Park, Edgemont Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania ... the Bishop's Mill Historical Institute, Inc)</ref>  Chester Pike, originally a footpath, was realigned and widened by [[William Penn]]. Known then as the \u201cQueens Highway,\u201d it was one of the region\u2019s first roads stretching from Chester to Darby, and by 1715, it reached Philadelphia. General [[George Washington]] led his troops down this earthen road to Wilmington and eventually to [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]] to confront the British in 1777.<ref>Martin, David G.; The Philadelphia Campaign June 1777\u2013July 1778; Combined Books; Conshohocken, Pennsylvania; 1993; {{ISBN|0-938289-19-5}}, page 78</ref> In 1799, the \u201cQueens Highway\u201d was improved as a plank road, and tolls were levied. The population of the area continued to increase after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Consequently, a private elementary [[Secondary School|subscription school]] was founded in 1800 on a site at Chester Pike and Myrtle Avenue. This was one of the first schools in Delaware County.<ref name=\"Early Pennsylvania 1912\">Narratives of Early Pennsylvania, West New Jersey and Delaware 1630-1707 (edited by Albert Cook Myers. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. 1912)</ref>\n\n===Railroad suburb===\nRidley Park was founded by [[Isaac Hinckley]] in 1871. He was the President of the [[Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The history of Ridley Park by Keith Lockhart Published in 1987, K. Lockhart (Ridley Park, Pa.)</ref>  He wanted to expand the company\u2019s rail line to gain more business in the same way the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] had earlier created a [[Philadelphia Main Line|Main Line]] from [[30th Street Station]] in Philadelphia to [[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]].  The Pennsylvania Railroad bought up farmland and developed towns all along its rail line. City dwellers, seeking relief from the urban crowds with their potential to spread [[malaria]] a disease that was a major health concern at the time, quickly purchased the new homes being built.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> \n \nSeeing the success of this, Hinckley came up with the idea of putting in a rail line that would pass through [[Darby, Pennsylvania|Darby]] and continue all the way to the semi-rural city of [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]] in what became known as the [[Darby Improvement]]<ref>History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania, Henry Graham Ashmead, Philadelphia: L. H. Everts & Co. 1884</ref> Hinckley's plans met with initial resistance from farmers, and at the end of the first year, he had managed to buy only one farm.  Undaunted, he traveled further south on [[Chester Pike]] to the area now known as Ridley Park.<ref>History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania. By Henry Graham Ashmead Philadelphia:L. H. Everts & Co.1884</ref>\n  \nIn an effort to avoid his previous bad experience, in May 1871, Hinckley formed an association to acquire the land.  Hinckley hired [[Robert Morris Copeland]], a noted Boston landscape architect, to develop a master plan for a suburban park community which became known as the  Borough of Ridley Park.  Copeland\u2019s design is Delaware County\u2019s first [[master planned community]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  Because of its beautifully landscaped streets and parks, and its {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} man-made lake, Ridley Park became popular in the late 19th century and early part of the 20th century as a summer resort for wealthy Philadelphians who built most of the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style homes still lived in today.<ref>The history of Ridley Park by Keith Lockhart Published in 1987, K. Lockhart (Ridley Park; Pa.)</ref>\n\nBetween January and May 1870, many farms were purchased.  The streets in the new development were named after the families who sold their farmland.  Names such as Burk, Dutton, Free, Henderson, Stewart and Ward, are still used today. The first train of passengers-cars stopped at Ridley Park on October 19, 1872.  By that time, the town had a hotel, and a dam had been built across [[Crum Creek]], creating a {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} lake.  By 1880, the U.S. census return recorded the population of Ridley Park as 439. The railroad was, and continues today to be an integral part of the town.<ref>History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania|Delaware County]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States. The population was 7,002 at the 2010 census. Ridley Park is the home of [[The Boeing Company]]'s [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|CH-47 Chinook helicopter]] division.<ref>Bush campaign to tour Boeing's Army helicopter factory in Delco, Pa. The Philadelphia Inquirer (Philadelphia, PA)  August 17, 2004</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Native American===\nThe [[Lenape]] inhabited the [[Delaware River]] region several centuries before the arrival of European explorers and traders.  The [[Okehocking Tribe]] of the [[Lenni Lenape]] Nation established small permanent villages along the river and its main tributaries. Land adjacent to Stoney Creek in [[Ridley Township, Pennsylvania|Ridley Township]] has been identified as a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] town site. Historians also believe that additional villages may have existed at other locations along Stoney Creek and Crum Creek in Ridley Park.<ref name=\"Early Pennsylvania 1912\"/>\nNative Americans significantly influenced the built environment through their network of paths laid out for travel and communication purposes. Their footpaths through the densely forested countryside grew into the first roads of the area. Chester Pike is believed to have developed from a footpath created by the Lenni Lenape as their main thoroughfare in the area.<ref>A History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania, edited by John W. Jordan, LL. D., published by Lewis Historical Publishing Company, New York 1914</ref>\n\n===Colonial===\nThe  borough is named after a place in [[Cheshire]], England. [[John Morton (American politician)|John Morton]], signer of the [[American Declaration of Independence]], was born and raised in a log cabin adjacent to East Ridley Avenue. He later replaced the cabin with a brick house and began farming {{convert|133|acre|km2}} in the Ridley Park area.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Historic structures report: Joseph Pratt Farmhouse, Colonial Pennsylvania Plantation, Ridley Creek State Park, Edgemont Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania ... the Bishop's Mill Historical Institute, Inc)</ref>  Chester Pike, originally a footpath, was realigned and widened by [[William Penn]]. Known then as the \u201cQueens Highway,\u201d it was one of the region\u2019s first roads stretching from Chester to Darby, and by 1715, it reached Philadelphia. General [[George Washington]] led his troops down this earthen road to Wilmington and eventually to [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]] to confront the British in 1777.<ref>Martin, David G.; The Philadelphia Campaign June 1777\u2013July 1778; Combined Books; Conshohocken, Pennsylvania; 1993; {{ISBN|0-938289-19-5}}, page 78</ref> In 1799, the \u201cQueens Highway\u201d was improved as a plank road, and tolls were levied. The population of the area continued to increase after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Consequently, a private elementary [[Secondary School|subscription school]] was founded in 1800 on a site at Chester Pike and Myrtle Avenue. This was one of the first schools in Delaware County.<ref name=\"Early Pennsylvania 1912\">Narratives of Early Pennsylvania, West New Jersey and Delaware 1630-1707 (edited by Albert Cook Myers. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. 1912)</ref>\n\n===Railroad suburb===\nRidley Park was founded by [[Isaac Hinckley]] in 1871. He was the President of the [[Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The history of Ridley Park by Keith Lockhart Published in 1987, K. Lockhart (Ridley Park, Pa.)</ref>  He wanted to expand the company\u2019s rail line to gain more business in the same way the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] had earlier created a [[Philadelphia Main Line|Main Line]] from [[30th Street Station]] in Philadelphia to [[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]].  The Pennsylvania Railroad bought up farmland and developed towns all along its rail line. City dwellers, seeking relief from the urban crowds with their potential to spread [[malaria]] a disease that was a major health concern at the time, quickly purchased the new homes being built.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> \n \nSeeing the success of this, Hinckley came up with the idea of putting in a rail line that would pass through [[Darby, Pennsylvania|Darby]] and continue all the way to the semi-rural city of [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]] in what became known as the [[Darby Improvement]]<ref>History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania, Henry Graham Ashmead, Philadelphia: L. H. Everts & Co. 1884</ref> Hinckley's plans met with initial resistance from farmers, and at the end of the first year, he had managed to buy only one farm.  Undaunted, he traveled further south on [[Chester Pike]] to the area now known as Ridley Park.<ref>History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania. By Henry Graham Ashmead Philadelphia:L. H. Everts & Co.1884</ref>\n  \nIn an effort to avoid his previous bad experience, in May 1871, Hinckley formed an association to acquire the land.  Hinckley hired [[Robert Morris Copeland]], a noted Boston landscape architect, to develop a master plan for a suburban park community which became known as the  Borough of Ridley Park.  Copeland\u2019s design is Delaware County\u2019s first [[master planned community]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  Because of its beautifully landscaped streets and parks, and its {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} man-made lake, Ridley Park became popular in the late 19th century and early part of the 20th century as a summer resort for wealthy Philadelphians who built most of the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style homes still lived in today.<ref>The history of Ridley Park by Keith Lockhart Published in 1987, K. Lockhart (Ridley Park; Pa.)</ref>\n\nBetween January and May 1870, many farms were purchased.  The streets in the new development were named after the families who sold their farmland.  Names such as Burk, Dutton, Free, Henderson, Stewart and Ward, are still used today. The first train of passengers-cars stopped at Ridley Park on October 19, 1872.  By that time, the town had a hotel, and a dam had been built across [[Crum Creek]], creating a {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} lake.  By 1880, the U.S. census return recorded the population of Ridley Park as 439. The railroad was, and continues today to be an integral part of the town.<ref>History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania.

{"title_page": "Trifles (play)", "text_new": "{{About|the play|the dessert|Trifle}}\n{{More footnotes|date=November 2019}}\n{{Italic title}}\n'''''Trifles''''' is a [[one-act play]] by [[Susan Glaspell]].  It was first performed by the [[Provincetown Players]] at the Wharf Theatre in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], on August 8, 1916.  In the original performance, Glaspell played the role of Mrs. Hale. The play is frequently anthologized in American literature textbooks. The play was soon followed by the short story, \"[[A Jury of Her Peers]]\", also written by Glaspell, which carries the same characters and plot line. Written at the same time of the first wave of feminism, the play contrasts between how women act in public and in private as well as how they perform in front of other women versus how they perform in front of men. \n\n==Characters==\n* '''George Henderson''' \u2013 The county attorney (originally played by [[Michael Hulgan]])\n* '''Henry Peters''' \u2013 Local sheriff and husband of Mrs. Peters (originally played by [[Robert Conville]])\n* '''Lewis Hale''' \u2013 Neighbor of the Wrights (originally played by [[George Cram Cook]])\n* '''Mrs. Peters''' \u2013 Wife of the sheriff (originally played by [[Alice Hall (actor)|Alice Hall]]). Mrs. Peters is able to see herself in Minnie in the early days of her marriage - she sees the isolation and childlessness that Minnie is suffering with. She makes the important connection of seeing female helplessness in the wake of male brutality<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ben-Xvi|first=Linda|date=4/19/2020|title=\"Murder, She Wrote\": The Genesis of Susan Glaspell's \"Trifles\"|url=|journal=Theatre Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>. \n* '''Mrs. Hale''' \u2013 Neighbor to the Wrights and wife of Lewis Hale (originally played by [[Susan Glaspell]], and later by Kim Base)\n* '''John Wright''' \u2013 The victim and owner of the house. \n* '''Mrs. Minnie Wright''' \u2013 John Wright's wife and his suspected murderer. She is never seen in the play, she is isolated in her jail cell throughout the play. Without Minnie being seen by the audience, this gives the audience the ability to not be swayed by what she looks like, her character, or her condition. Audience members can see her quality of life in her home without having to see her, allowing them to deduce their own conclusions<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe play begins as the men, followed by the women, enter the Wrights\u2019 empty farmhouse. On command from the county attorney, Mr. Hale recounts his visit to the house the previous day, when he found Mrs. Wright behaving strangely and her husband dead upstairs with a rope around his neck. Mr. Hale notes that when he questioned her, Mrs. Wright claimed that she was asleep when someone strangled her husband. While the county attorney, Mr. Hale, and Mr. Peters are searching the house for evidence, Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters find clues in the kitchen and hallway to this unsolved mystery. The men find no clues upstairs in the Wright house that would prove Mrs. Wright guilty, but the women find a dead canary that cracks the case wide open. The wives realize Mr. Wright killed the bird, and that led to Mrs. Wright killing her husband. The wives piece together that Minnie was being abused by her husband, and they understand how it feels to be oppressed by men. Because they feel bad for Minnie, they hide the evidence against her and she is spared the punishment for killing her husband.\n\n== Background ==\nThe play is loosely based on the murder of John Hossack, which Glaspell reported on while working as a news journalist for the ''[[Des Moines Daily News]]''.  Hossack's wife, Margaret, was accused of killing her husband. Margaret was also abused by her husband. However, Margaret argued that an intruder had killed John with an axe.  Allegedly, Mrs. Hossack committed the murder and she was sent to a state penitentiary. She was convicted but it was overturned on appeal.<ref>Belasco & Johnson, The Bedford Anthology of American Literature, Volume II: 1865-Present, Bedford-St.Martin's Press, Boston, 2008, p.782</ref> Due to the in depth information she received from the case Glaspell was able to go into graphic details in Trifles. Sixteen years after this unsolved murder was committed, Trifles was released. \n<blockquote>\n''\"...years later ... the haunting image of Margaret Hossack's kitchen came rushing back to Glaspell.  In a span of ten days, Glaspell composed a one-act play, ''Trifles'' ... A year later, Glaspell reworked the material into a short story titled \"[[A Jury of Her Peers]].\"''<ref>Bryan, Patricia L. and Thomas Wolf. ''Midnight Assassin: A Murder in America's Heartland''. Chapel Hill, NC: Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 2005. xii-xiii</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Performance history==\n''Trifles'' premiered at the [[Wharf Theater (Provincetown)|Wharf Theater]] in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], in 1916.\n\n== Feminist drama ==\n\n''Trifles'' is seen as an example of early [[feminist]] drama.  The two female characters, Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale are able to sympathize with Minnie, the victim's wife, and understand her possible motive, which leads them to the evidence against her. The men, meanwhile, are blinded by their cold, emotionless investigation of material facts.  Clearly, the wife is represented by the caged bird, a common symbol of women's roles in society. \n\nThe male characters are prejudiced in believing that nothing important can be discovered in areas of the house where Minnie spent most of her time. Their minds are clouded by prejudice and they disregard important clues as being mere \"trifles\" that women concern themselves with. They search the barn and the bedroom, places where men have dominance, rather than the kitchen, the only place where a woman would be in charge. One important line, spoken by the sheriff, says of the kitchen \"Nothing here but kitchen things.\"  This dismissal of the importance of a woman's life and the male reluctance to enter the \"women's sphere\" is key in the men's failure to discover the crucial evidence for the case. The most important evidence, the dead canary that the two women find, was hidden in Minnie's sewing basket. The men scorn the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]], even kicking some of the items in contempt.\n\nThe two women, having pieced together the murder, face the moral dilemma of telling the men about the motive or protecting Minnie, whom they see as a victim.  Their choice raises questions about solidarity among women, the meaning of justice, and the role of women in society as a source of justice. \"Women who kill evoke fear because they challenge societal constructs of femininity - passivity, restraint, and nurture\"<ref name=\":0\" />, states Ben-Zvi. \n\nWomen and men view the nature of Minnie Wright\u2019s crime very differently.  The men in this play are blind to the emotional abuse that Minnie went through from her husband. In 1917, women were not even allowed to vote, serve as legislators, judges, or be on a jury<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Angel|first=Marina|date=|title=Teaching Susan Glaspell's A Jury of Her Peers and Trifles|url=|journal=Journal of Legal Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>. In America, the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|sixth amendment]] states that the accused are allowed to have a jury of their peers, in 1917 America, if a woman committed a crime and had to go to trial; she would not be surrounded with her peers. However in this instance, the women act as Minnie\u2019s unofficial jury in the kitchen. The women find evidence of abuse and realize that is why Minnie killed her husband for. They end up throwing away and hiding evidence, to keep Minnie from being convicted. It is not known if Minnie will go to a real court or not. Readers are able to view this story in multiple different viewpoints and it is beneficial to readers to see that things are multifaceted and how different views of a situation can impact someone\u2019s decision. \n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the constant themes and focuses of the story is the divide between the [[psychology]] of men and women. Their respective [[social roles]] allow them to perceive very different aspects of Minnie's life. One of the differences in psychology shown in the play is that women need a sense of community and do not fare well with loneliness, while men seem to be able to cope with loneliness.\n\nThere is also a theme of justice within the play, as the wives of the men recognize that Minnie was abused by her husband, and hide the evidence against her so that she will not be found guilty. The women side with Minnie and understand why she chose to kill her husband. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/trifles/themes|title=Trifles Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-07}}</ref> Meanwhile, the men in the play do not see the years of abuse she went through and just want to gather the evidence against her and send Minnie to jail got the murder of her husband. \n\nAnother theme of this play is isolation and abuse, John kept Minnie locked in the house without any communication to the outside world as the telephone was disconnected, not leaving her any money, not buying her any new clothes thus limiting her interaction with any other women, maybe in fear of shame, as well as killing her pet canary.  \n\n== Symbolism ==\n\nAs the women note, Minnie used to sing before she married John Wright. Martha theorizes that after Minnie's marriage, she was prevented, by her husband, from singing or doing anything else which would have yielded her pleasure. Minnie's plight is represented by Martha as a spiritual death, symbolized in the strangling of her songbird companion.\n\nAnother point worth noting is that both Martha and Mrs. Peters express guilt over not having visited Minnie more often\u2014 which opens up the possibility that Martha's reading of the evidence is skewed by her own feelings that she should have helped Minnie.\n\nThe use of Minnie's name is also symbolic. When the women talk about her, they use the name Minnie only when talking about her past. When she was a free-spirited, single woman her name was Minnie. This represents her happiness. The Women refer to her as Mrs. Wright when talking about her more recently. They talk as if Minnie died when she was married and Mrs. Wright took her place. The free-spirit died and was replaced by an isolated wife. The use of her names varies to demonstrate this metaphorical death.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mai|first1=Sarah|title=A STUDY OF SYMBOLS IN SUSAN GLASPELL'S TRIFLES|url=http://download.portalgaruda.org/article.php?article=158362&val=5319&title=A%20STUDY%20OF%20SYMBOLS%20IN%20SUSAN%20GLASPELL|publisher=Universitas Pesantren Tinggi Darul Ulum Jombang|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMinnie is embodied in her kitchen and sewing things.  The cold weather freezes and breaks her preserve jars, symbolizing the cold environment of her home breaking her spirit, as well as the coldness which causes the characters to fail in human empathy towards each other. The cold weather can also symbolize how Mr. Wright treated Minnie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/trifles/shattered-preserves-symbol.html|title=Shattered Preserves in Trifles|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> The bare kitchen can be seen as a symbol of the lives of the former inhabitants.\n\nThe male characters are clear symbols of \"law\" and cold rationality, while the women display an intuitiveness representative of the [[psychoanalytic]] movement, evoking an interrogation of the value of superficial rational thought.\n\nMrs. Wright also acts as the \"invisible\" heroine for women's rights as the play was written and set during the suffragette movement.\n\nSewing, quilting, and knitting are pastimes of women. This play features a quilt and the women in the story are able to quilt together what happened in the house. The quilt Minnie was making included a [[hearth]] in the middle of it. Typically, a hearth is the symbol of a woman\u2019s dominant place in the house. In regards to Minnie, her hearth is broken and cold stove<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=|title=feminism as theme in twentieth-century american women's drama|last=Friedman|first=Sharon|date=4/19/2020|website=JSTOR|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Minnie ended up knotting pieces of the quilt, subsequently, the same knot is used to kill John Wright. However, the women recognize this and the men do not as men do not trivialize with womanly things. One of the women covers up Minnie\u2019s bad quilting with good quilting so Minnie will not look guilty. \n\nMinnie is chastised about not having a pristine and clean kitchen: the kitchen table is only half clean, the sugar bucket cover was not on completely. Minnie was not able to finish baking her bread. While the men look over these details, brushing it off as Minnie being lazy, the women recognize the signs and continue to piece together what truly conspired.\n\nThe canary has a significant role, Before Minnie was married to her husband, the canary was a significant portion of her life, she enjoyed to hear it sing and was even described \u201cas a bird herself\u201d. The canary was ultimately strangled by her husband. The canary symbolizes Minnie, as John strangled the canary after he got frustrated with its singing. Minnie was then silenced with John\u2019s abuse as he silenced the canary<ref name=\":1\" />. The broken birdcage also symbolizes the depressing marriage that John and Minnie are in. They are trapped in a cage of marriage.The killing of Minnie\u2019s pet was her breaking point, a woman scorned took her revenge on her abusive husband. The killing of the canary also symbolizes the loss of Minnie\u2019s voice and her freedom. The women in Minnie\u2019s kitchen are the only ones who understand the significance of the dead canary; they decide not to share it with the men. If they shared their finding of the canary, the men could use it as evidence against Minnie, making her seem more guilty, they blame the cat on eating the canary, since women are after all only obsessed with trifles. Friedman states \"Feminism as a theme\u00a0 should not be understood as simply a call for women's rights on the part of the playwright or her characters. Rather, it may be a statement about feminine consciousness, the feelings and perceptions associated with a female character's identity of a woman.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  Without the women not telling the men about the canary, they are showing the readers that they are more controlling of the situation than then men are. \n\n== Modern theatre ==\nThe main \"players\" in the murder, Minnie (the murderer) and John Wright (the murdered), are never seen on stage.  Their lives and personalities are fleshed out in the dialogue of other characters.  The small cast and understated scenery both serve to turn the audience to the inward lives of the characters.\n\n== Title ==\n\nThe title is derived from Lewis Hale's line \"Well, women are used to worrying over \"[[trifle]]s.\"\nThe title also suggests that women's actions and concerns are considered by the men as mere \"trifles\".\nTrifles are seen as a minor mishap. The women's actions do not matter to the men in this investigation.\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe play was adapted by James P. Cavanagh for an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, which first aired on December 26, 1961, with the alternate title \u201cA Jury of Her Peers.\u201d  It was directed by Robert Florey, and its cast included Ann Harding, Philip Bourneuf, Frances Reid, Robert Bray, June Walker, and Ray Teal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0508107/|website=IMDB|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}</ref> Hitchcock added his usual disclaimer at the end, stating that the killer and her \u201caccomplices\u201d were caught and convicted.\n\n''Trifles'', a [[chamber opera]] in one act, premiered in [[Berkeley, California]], at the Live Oak Theatre on June 17 and 19, 2010.  It was composed by John G. Bilotta, and it is [[libretto]] was written by John F. McGrew.  The chamber opera is scored for five singers and [[Sextet|six instruments]], including a piano, and it requires some basic stage props.  As in the play, the central figures (Mr. and Mrs. Wright) are absent from the cast of characters.  Instead, through the libretto, Lewis Hale reenacts the events surrounding the discovery of Mr. Wright's murder, where he was present.\n\n== Literary criticism and significance ==\nPhyllis Mael analyzes \"Trifles\" in regards to developmental psychology. The moral development for women differ to those of men, a woman's moral judgement is \"tied to feelings of empathy and compassion\", whereas a mans moral judgement is \"impersonal\" and \"independent of its emotional origins\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mael |first1=Phyllis |title=The Path to Sisterhood |url=https://search-ebscohost-com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=6897362&site=ehost-live&scope=site |website=Literature Film Quarterly |accessdate=2019-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes|30em}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Ben-Zvi|first=Linda|title='Murder, She Wrote': The Genesis of Susan Glaspell's 'Trifles'|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1992|volume=44|issue=2|pages=141\u2013162|url=http://americanfiction.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/files/2010/06/Trifles-Genesis.pdf|accessdate=26 March 2014|doi=10.2307/3208736|jstor=3208736}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hinz-Bode|first=Kristina|title=Susan Glaspell and the anxiety of expression|date=2006|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=55\u201374|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5SzHjfQBbgC&printsec=frontcover&dq|isbn=9780786483709}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ghostranchproductions.com/ \"Trifles\" on DVD]\n*[http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=modern_english/uvaGenText/tei/GlaTrif.xml Text of ''Trifles'' from the University of Virginia]\n* {{librivox book | title=Trifles | author=Susan GLASPELL}}\n\n[[Category:1916 plays]]\n[[Category:Plays by Susan Glaspell]]\n[[Category:One-act plays]]\n[[Category:Plays based on actual events]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the play|the dessert|Trifle}}\n{{More footnotes|date=November 2019}}\n{{Italic title}}\n'''''Trifles''''' is a [[one-act play]] by [[Susan Glaspell]].

The play was soon followed by the short story, \"[[A Jury of Her Peers]]\", also written by Glaspell, which carries the same characters and plot line.

Rather, it may be a statement about feminine consciousness, the feelings and perceptions associated with a female character's identity of a woman.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  Without the women not telling the men about the canary, they are showing the readers that they are more controlling of the situation than then men are. \n\n== Modern theatre ==\nThe main \"players\" in the murder, Minnie (the murderer) and John Wright (the murdered), are never seen on stage.  Their lives and personalities are fleshed out in the dialogue of other characters.  The small cast and understated scenery both serve to turn the audience to the inward lives of the characters.\n\n== Title ==\n\nThe title is derived from Lewis Hale's line \"Well, women are used to worrying over \"[[trifle]]s.\"\nThe title also suggests that women's actions and concerns are considered by the men as mere \"trifles\".\nTrifles are seen as a minor mishap. The women's actions do not matter to the men in this investigation.\n\n== Adaptations ==\nThe play was adapted by James P. Cavanagh for an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, which first aired on December 26, 1961, with the alternate title \u201cA Jury of Her Peers.\u201d  It was directed by Robert Florey, and its cast included Ann Harding, Philip Bourneuf, Frances Reid, Robert Bray, June Walker, and Ray Teal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0508107/|website=IMDB|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}</ref> Hitchcock added his usual disclaimer at the end, stating that the killer and her \u201caccomplices\u201d were caught and convicted.\n\n''Trifles'', a [[chamber opera]] in one act, premiered in [[Berkeley, California]], at the Live Oak Theatre on June 17 and 19, 2010.  It was composed by John G. Bilotta, and it is [[libretto]] was written by John F. McGrew.  The chamber opera is scored for five singers and [[Sextet|six instruments]], including a piano, and it requires some basic stage props.  As in the play, the central figures (Mr. and Mrs. Wright) are absent from the cast of characters.  Instead, through the libretto, Lewis Hale reenacts the events surrounding the discovery of Mr. Wright's murder, where he was present.\n\n== Literary criticism and significance ==\nPhyllis Mael analyzes \"Trifles\" in regards to developmental psychology. The moral development for women differ to those of men, a woman's moral judgement is \"tied to feelings of empathy and compassion\", whereas a mans moral judgement is \"impersonal\" and \"independent of its emotional origins\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mael |first1=Phyllis |title=The Path to Sisterhood |url=https://search-ebscohost-com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu/login.aspx?direct=true&db=aph&AN=6897362&site=ehost-live&scope=site |website=Literature Film Quarterly |accessdate=2019-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes|30em}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Ben-Zvi|first=Linda|title='Murder, She Wrote': The Genesis of Susan Glaspell's 'Trifles'|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1992|volume=44|issue=2|pages=141\u2013162|url=http://americanfiction.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/files/2010/06/Trifles-Genesis.pdf|accessdate=26 March 2014|doi=10.2307/3208736|jstor=3208736}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hinz-Bode|first=Kristina|title=Susan Glaspell and the anxiety of expression|date=2006|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=55\u201374|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5SzHjfQBbgC&printsec=frontcover&dq|isbn=9780786483709}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ghostranchproductions.com/ \"Trifles\" on DVD]\n*[http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=modern_english/uvaGenText/tei/GlaTrif.xml Text of ''Trifles'' from the University of Virginia]\n* {{librivox book | title=Trifles | author=Susan GLASPELL}}\n\n[[Category:1916 plays]]\n[[Category:Plays by Susan Glaspell]]\n[[Category:One-act plays]]\n[[Category:Plays based on actual events]]\n", "name_user": "Briannamorgan", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifles_(play)"}
