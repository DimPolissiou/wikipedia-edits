It was released as on [[contemporary hit radio]] on May 23 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's 19th single to be [[Music recording certification|certified]] gold and the 13th best-selling single in 2000, selling over 600,000 copies in sales. It reached number five in the United Kingdom, where it attained a silver certification. The song peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain, as well as in the top 20 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer. She was later personally offered by Jackson to appear in the music video for \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]]\", and perform as a dancer on the [[All for You Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428172/20000523/dmx.jhtml|title=LL, Sisqo, Jay-Z, Foxy, DMX, More For \"Klumps\"|website=[[MTV News]]|date=May 23, 2000|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

A panoramic view of a brightly-lit city is displayed, panning inside a confined apartment containing Janet Jackson and an AIBO. Jackson sings on top of the bed as objects in the room are individually displayed, including a descending glass shelf, a digital alarm clock, a magazine container, a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. During the chorus, Jackson grabs a beverage from the fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four women appear outside the door as Jackson exits her room, when the room darkens.\n\nThe five women dance through the apartment hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform. Beginning from the song's breakdown, the women perform a choreographed dance routine on the platform while it tilts in different directions. The scenes are interspersed with Jackson drawing an orange swirl towards the camera and the AIBO watching the film in the apartment, while in the song's [[Bridge (music)|bridge]], various people are seen drawing orange swirls. Jackson is positioned inside the passenger seat of a car driving through a tunnel, as scenes from the film are displayed as a reflection in the front window. The video concludes with a [[slow motion]] shot of Jackson falling backwards onto the bed, with the AIBO resting in front.\n\n===Reception===\nWriting for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson praised the music video for deviating from the standard \"lip-synch/film snippet formula\" used among pop videos at the time, stating that it \"stands on its own\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/klumpsuncensored.shtml|title=Nutty Professor II: The Klumps \u2013 Uncensored Director's Cut (2000)|website=DVD Movie Guide|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|year=2000|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}</ref> ''Sun-Sentinel'' included \"Doesn't Really Matter\" among several videos which set fashion trends and increased the popularity of \"bright colorful clothes\" among youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-08-08/lifestyle/0008070457_1_colors-young-women-video|title=What Are The Coolest Kids Wearing This Fall?

It was released as on [[contemporary hit radio]] on May 23 2000, after an [[Mastering (audio)|unmastered]] version was leaked. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Dance music|dance]] song that speaks about loving a person for who they are and disregarding their physical appearance. The track is based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of her previous album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\nThe song generally received positive reception, becoming Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States after peaking on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. It was Jackson's 19th single to be [[Music recording certification|certified]] gold and the 13th best-selling single in 2000, selling over 600,000 copies in sales. It reached number five in the United Kingdom, where it attained a silver certification. The song peaked within the top 10 in Canada, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain, as well as in the top 20 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to scenes from the film, it also features futuristic technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. It had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, causing it to become one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her earliest appearances in the video, performing as a dancer. She was later personally offered by Jackson to appear in the music video for \"[[All for You (Janet Jackson song)|All for You]]\", and perform as a dancer on the [[All for You Tour]].\n\n==Background and development==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]].<ref name=\"LinerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Doesn't Really Matter|others=[[Janet Jackson]]|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Def Jam Records]]|id=562 916-2|location=New York City}}</ref> She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of [[The Nutty Professor (character)|Sherman Klump]], who is one of many characters portrayed by Murphy.<ref name=\"KlumpsMTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428172/20000523/dmx.jhtml|title=LL, Sisqo, Jay-Z, Foxy, DMX, More For \"Klumps\"|website=[[MTV News]]|date=May 23, 2000|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref> When asked to contribute a single for the [[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps (soundtrack)|movie's soundtrack]], Jackson stated that she would consider if she found an appropriate song.<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|title=Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]|edition=3|page=902|isbn=0823077381}}</ref> The single would allow Jackson to continue releasing music, while simultaneously devoting time to her film career.<ref>{{cite book|date=July 21\u201323, 2000|title=Action Jackson|work=[[USA Weekend]]|page=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|date=November 2000|title=Janet at the Crossroads|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|page=181}}</ref> To help inspire Jackson, director [[Peter Segal]] brought a rough cut of the film to Flyte Tyme Studios where the singer was recording her seventh album, ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''.

A panoramic view of a brightly-lit city is displayed, panning inside a confined apartment containing Janet Jackson and an AIBO. Jackson sings on top of the bed as objects in the room are individually displayed, including a descending glass shelf, a digital alarm clock, a magazine container, a television displaying ''Nutty Professor II: The Klumps'', and a pair of [[moon shoes]]. During the chorus, Jackson grabs a beverage from the fridge and starts singing in front of a mirror containing visually animated animal stickers. Four women appear outside the door as Jackson exits her room, when the room darkens.\n\nThe five women dance through the apartment hallway as their shoes morph into black futuristic high-heels, walking into an area filled with display screens and a circular platform. Beginning from the song's breakdown, the women perform a choreographed dance routine on the platform while it tilts in different directions. The scenes are interspersed with Jackson drawing an orange swirl towards the camera and the AIBO watching the film in the apartment, while in the song's [[Bridge (music)|bridge]], various people are seen drawing orange swirls.

{"title_page": "Derived algebraic geometry", "text_new": "'''Derived algebraic geometry''' is a branch of mathematics that generalizes [[algebraic geometry]] to a situation where [[commutative ring]]s, which provide local charts, are replaced by either [[differential graded algebra]]s (over <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>), [[simplicial commutative ring]]s or [[Highly structured ring spectrum|<math>E_{\\infty}</math>-ring spectra]] from [[algebraic topology]], whose higher homotopy groups account for the non-discreteness (e.g., Tor) of the structure sheaf. Grothendieck's [[scheme theory]] allows the structure sheaf to carry [[nilpotent element]]s. Derived algebraic geometry can be thought of as an extension of this idea, and provides natural settings for [[intersection theory]] (or [[motivic homotopy theory]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=Adeel A.|year=2019|title=Brave new motivic homotopy theory I|journal=Geom. Topol.|volume=23|pages=3647\u20133685|arxiv=1610.06871|doi=10.2140/gt.2019.23.3647}}</ref>) of singular algebraic varieties and [[cotangent complex]]es in [[deformation theory]] (cf. J. Francis), among the other applications.\n\n== Introduction ==\nBasic objects of study in the field are [[derived scheme]]s and [[derived stack]]s. The oft-cited motivation is [[Serre's intersection formula]].<ref>[https://mathoverflow.net/q/12236 Serre intersection formula and derived algebraic geometry?]</ref> In the usual formulation, the formula involves the [[Tor functor]] and thus, unless higher Tor vanish, the [[scheme-theoretic intersection]] (i.e., fiber product of immersions) ''does not'' yield the correct [[intersection number]]. In the derived context, one takes the [[derived tensor product]] <math>A \\otimes^L B</math>, whose higher homotopy is higher Tor, whose [[\u00e9tale Spec|Spec]] is not a scheme but a [[derived scheme]]. Hence, the \"derived\" fiber product yields the correct intersection number. (Currently this is hypothetical; the derived intersection theory has yet to be developed.)\n\nThe term \"derived\" is used in the same way as [[derived functor]] or [[derived category]], in the sense that the category of commutative rings is being replaced with a [[\u221e-category]] of \"derived rings.\"  In classical algebraic geometry, the derived category of [[quasi-coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent sheaves]] is viewed as a [[triangulated category]], but it has natural enhancement to a [[stable \u221e-category]], which can be thought of as the [[\u221e-category|\u221e-categorical]] analogue of an [[abelian category]].\n\n== Definitions ==\nDerived algebraic geometry is fundamentally the study of geometric objects using homological algebra and homotopy. Since objects in this field should encode the homological and homotopy information, there are various notions of what derived spaces encapsulate. The basic objects of study in derived algebraic geometry are derived schemes, and more generally, derived stacks. Heuristically, derived schemes should be functors from some category of derived rings to the category of sets\n:<math>F: \\text{DerRings} \\to \\text{Sets}</math>\nwhich can be generalized further to have targets of higher groupoids (which are expected to be modelled by homotopy types). These derived stacks are suitable functors of the form\n:<math>F: \\text{DerRings} \\to \\text{HoT}</math>\nMany authors model such functors as functors with values in simplicial sets, since they model homotopy types and are well-studied. Differing definitions on these derived spaces depend on a choice of what the derived rings are, and what the homotopy types should look like. Some examples of derived rings include commutative differential graded algebras, simplicial rings, and <math>E_\\infty</math>-rings.\n\n=== Derived geometry over characteristic 0 ===\nOver characteristic 0 many of the derived geometries agree since the derived rings are the same. <math>E_\\infty</math> algebras are just commutative differential graded algebras over characteristic zero. We can then define derived schemes similarly to schemes in algebraic geometry. Similar to algebraic geometry, we could also view these objects as a pair <math>(X,\\mathcal{O}_X^\\bullet)</math> which is a topological space <math>X</math> with a sheaf of commutative differential graded algebras. Sometimes authors take the convention that these are negatively graded, so <math>\\mathcal{O}_X^{n} = 0</math> for <math>n > 0</math>. The sheaf condition could also be weakened so that for a cover <math>U_i</math> of <math>X</math>, the sheaves <math>\\mathcal{O}_{U_i}^\\bullet</math> would glue on overlaps <math>U_{ij}</math> only by quasi-isomorphism.\n\nUnfortunately, over characteristic p, differential graded algebras work poorly for homotopy theory, due to the fact <math>d[x^p] = p[x^{p-1}]</math>[https://mathoverflow.net/questions/229022/why-do-people-say-dg-algebras-behave-badly-in-positive-characteristic]. This can be overcome by using simplicial algebras.\n\n=== Derived geometry over arbitrary characteristic ===\nDerived rings over arbitrary characteristic are taken as simplicial rings because of the nice categorical properties these have. In particular, the category of simplicial rings is simplicially enriched, meaning the hom-sets are themselves simplicial sets. Also, there is a canonical model structure on simplicial commutative rings coming from simplicial sets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://math.uchicago.edu/~amathew/SCR.pdf|title=Simplicial Commutative Rings, I|last=Mathew|first=Akhil|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616111255/http://math.uchicago.edu/~amathew/SCR.pdf|archive-date=16 Jun 2019|access-date=}}</ref> In fact, it is a theorem of Quillen's that the model structure on simplicial sets can be transferred over to simplicial commutative rings.\n\n=== Higher Stacks ===\nIt is conjectured there is a final theory of higher stacks which model [[Homotopy hypothesis|homotopy types]]. Grothendieck conjectured these would be modelled by globular groupoids, or  a weak form of their definition. Simpson<ref>{{cite arxiv|last=Simpson|first=Carlos|date=1996-09-17|title=Algebraic (geometric) $n$-stacks|eprint=alg-geom/9609014}}</ref> gives a useful definition in the spirit of Grothendieck's ideas. Recall that an algebraic stack (here a 1-stack) is called representable is the fiber product of any two schemes is isomorphic to a scheme.<ref>Which can be checked by looking at the diagonal morphism and checking if that itself is representable. Check out https://web.archive.org/save/https://math.dartmouth.edu/~jvoight/notes/moduli-red-harvard.pdf for more information</ref> If we take the ansatz a 0-stack is just an algebraic space, a 1-stack is just a stack, we can recursively define an n-stack as an object such that the fiber product along any two schemes is an (n-1)-stack. If we go back the definition of an algberaic stack, this new definition agrees.\n\n== Applications==\n\n* Derived algebraic geometry was used by {{harvtxt|Kerz|Strunk|Tamme|2018}} to prove [[Weibel's conjecture]] on vanishing of negative [[algebraic K-theory|K-theory]].\n* The formulation of the [[Geometric Langlands correspondence|Geometric Langlands conjecture]] by Arinkin and [[Dennis Gaitsgory|Gaitsgory]] uses derived algebraic geometry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arinkin |first1=Dima|last2=Gaitsgory |first2=Dennis |date=2015|title=Singular support of coherent sheaves and the geometric Langlands conjecture |journal=Selecta Math. |volume=21|number=1|pages=1\u2013199|doi=10.1007/s00029-014-0167-5}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Derived scheme]]\n*[[Noncommutative algebraic geometry]]\n*[[Simplicial commutative ring]]\n*[[Algebra over an operad]]\n*[[En-ring]]\n*''[[Higher Topos Theory]]''\n*[[\u221e-topos]]\n*[[\u00e9tale spectrum]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*[[David Ben-Zvi|Ben-Zvi, D.]], Francis, J., and D.

Just when it seems it will be Yusho's victory, Yuri turns the table in his favor by revealing that his trump card is not Super Polymerization that Yusho had thought. Yuri's true trump card is Ultra Polymerization that allows him to summon Starving Venom Fusion Dragon and Yugo's Clear Wing Synchro Dragon. The summoning of the two dragons caused Zarc inside Yuya and Yuto to react again. Using the dragons' special abilities in conjunction with a vicious double spell card combo, Yuri reduces Yusho's life points to zero and seals Yusho in a card.

Deciding to take a risk to defeat Yuri, Yuto convinces Yuya to summon Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon, which consequently causes Yuto to finally succumb to Zarc's control and leaves Yuya to fight Yuri alone.

Zarc is able to perform an Xyz Summon during Shay's turn and summons Supreme King Dragon Dark Rebellion. Furthermore, his power ensures his monster will not be affected by any Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz effects. While looking for Leo, Declan and Riley see the souls of the people from New Domino City and Heartland City due to the dimensional integration. In Heartland City, Allen and Saya got absorbed into a wormhole that sent them to Shay and Kite's location. Shay and Kite are able to power up their monsters' attacks higher than Dark Rebellion just as it used up its Overlay Units. However, Zarc sent Dark Rebellion back to his Extra Deck to bring back the monsters he used to summon it and reduces Shay and Kite's monsters' attack points to zero. When they attempted to use the Action Cards, Z-ARC's power destroyed the Action Cards they got as any card they add to their hands outside Draw Phase will be destroyed.

Zarc summons Supreme King Dragon Clear Wing and activates an equip spell card that allows it to attack and inflict damage on all of Jack and Gong's monsters. Due to Gong's monsters' abilities, Jack survived the attacks, while Gong received all the damage that eventually defeated him. Due to dimensional integration, New Domino City got transported into the Fusion Dimension. Crow is revived and joins the duel with Sylvio. Despite able to finally destroy Supreme King Dragon Clear Wing, Zarc remains unscathed due to his Supreme Gates' Pendulum abilities and defeats Jack. Gong tells Sylvio that Zarc flinched when he called him a Dueltainer, which he believes to be the proof that Yuya still exists.

While he attacks, Crow notices how much Zarc does not want to lose and points this fact to Z-ARC, who starts to lose his composure as Crow is finally able to inflict some damage onto Zarc. When Sylvio performs a Pendulum Summon, Zarc summons Supreme King Dragon Odd-Eyes. Sylvio manages to force Zarc into a defensive position, but he fails to destroy the Supreme King Dragon Odd-Eyes because Zarc is using the monsters he has destroyed to protect it. With the combination of his trap card and Odd-Eyes' effect, Zarc defeats Crow and Sylvio. As the dimensional integration nears its completion, Leo intrudes in the duel, which is followed by Declan. Unfortunately, before Leo can use the four Natural Energy cards necessary to defeat Zarc, Zarc uses a trap card to destroy it together with Leo.

Zarc summons all of his Supreme King Dragons and swiftly defeats Declan as Ray joins the duel through Riley's body. Ray proceeds to retrieve the four Natural Energy cards from Leo's graveyard to negate Z-ARC's Fusion, Sychro, and Xyz attributes to significantly weaken him and destroy his Supreme Dragon form. Despite Z-ARC's insistence that Yuya is no more, Ray reveals that Pendulum Summon was created from both Zarc's vengeful desires and the power of the four Natural Energy cards themselves. Zuzu briefly manifests separately to reach Yuya within his mind and remind him of his desire and promise to her. With Yuya's counterparts supporting him, Yuya musters the strength to regain control over himself to place Zarc at a greater disadvantage for Ray to finish the duel. As Arc-V begins to splinter once more, Riley uses this moment to regain control of his body so he can use the four Natural Energy cards' power to extract Zarc from Yuya and seal Zarc's spirit into himself.\n| LineColor       = 006600\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh!

He explains that Yuya's skills as a Dueltainer might enable Riley to smile to stop Zarc for good.

December 15, 2018 (Nicktoons)\n| ShortSummary    = Declan destroyed the four dragons with his Superdoom King's special abilities. With Yuto, Yugo, and Yuri's support, Yuya performs Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz summons to summon Odd-Eyes Venom Dragon, Odd-Eyes Wing Dragon, and Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon in that order. He manages to deal considerable damage to Declan, but he failed to destroy his monsters. Yuya uses the Pendulum ability of Performapal Five-Rainbow Magician to make both of their monsters' attack points go zero and only by placing five Action Cards on the field face down, the monsters' attack points would be doubled. Yuya and Declan begin racing who can place five Action Cards face down first by picking Action Cards. Yuya succeeded in place the five Action Cards ahead, but Declan also activates his D/D Savant Einstein\u2019s special ability to place his last Action Card face down and doubled his monsters' attack points that overpowers Yuya's. Already anticipating this, Yuya uses his monster's Pendulum ability to increase Odd-Eyes' attack points for each Pendulum Monster on his field. With Odd-Eyes' effect doubling the damage, Yuya defeats Declan. Yuya's Dueltaining pacifies Zarc's soul and allows Riley to smile. Ray reacts to the Dueltainment and transports Yuya's friends across dimensions to the Pendulum Dimension, where she is finally revived as Zuzu, with her other reincarnations residing within her, and reunites with Yuya. In addition, the four dimensions are reunited into one dimension once more. Yusho challenges Yuya to a duel because Yuya has officially become a professional duelist. As Yuya accepts his father's challenge, Yuya declares he will continue bringing smiles with his dueling and surpass his father as a Dueltainer.\n| LineColor       = 006600\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"n\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Yu-Gi-Oh!}}\n\n[[Category:Yu-Gi-Oh! seasons|Arc-V (season 3)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2019}}\n{{Infobox television season\n| bgcolour         = #006600\n| image            = Yu-Gi-Oh!

Deciding to take a risk to defeat Yuri, Yuto convinces Yuya to summon Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon, which consequently causes Yuto to finally succumb to Zarc's control and leaves Yuya to fight Yuri alone.

It was not until Declan, Riley, Sora, and Aster expresses their faith in him that Yuya regains his determination.

Zarc is able to perform an Xyz Summon during Shay's turn and summons Supreme King Dragon Dark Rebellion. Furthermore, his power ensures his monster will not be affected by any Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz effects. While looking for Leo, Declan and Riley see the souls of the people from New Domino City and Heartland City due to the dimensional integration. In Heartland City, Allen and Saya got absorbed into a wormhole that sent them to Shay and Kite's location. Shay and Kite are able to power up their monsters' attacks higher than Dark Rebellion just as it used up its Overlay Units. However, Zarc sent Dark Rebellion back to his Extra Deck to bring back the monsters he used to summon it and reduces Shay and Kite's monsters' attack points to zero. When they attempted to use the Action Cards, Z-ARC's power destroyed the Action Cards they got as any card they add to their hands outside Draw Phase will be destroyed.

Zarc summons Supreme King Dragon Clear Wing and activates an equip spell card that allows it to attack and inflict damage on all of Jack and Gong's monsters. Due to Gong's monsters' abilities, Jack survived the attacks, while Gong received all the damage that eventually defeated him. Due to dimensional integration, New Domino City got transported into the Fusion Dimension. Crow is revived and joins the duel with Sylvio. Despite able to finally destroy Supreme King Dragon Clear Wing, Zarc remains unscathed due to his Supreme Gates' Pendulum abilities and defeats Jack. Gong tells Sylvio that Zarc flinched when he called him a Dueltainer, which he believes to be the proof that Yuya still exists.

While he attacks, Crow notices how much Zarc does not want to lose and points this fact to Z-ARC, who starts to lose his composure as Crow is finally able to inflict some damage onto Zarc. When Sylvio performs a Pendulum Summon, Zarc summons Supreme King Dragon Odd-Eyes. Sylvio manages to force Zarc into a defensive position, but he fails to destroy the Supreme King Dragon Odd-Eyes because Zarc is using the monsters he has destroyed to protect it. With the combination of his trap card and Odd-Eyes' effect, Zarc defeats Crow and Sylvio. As the dimensional integration nears its completion, Leo intrudes in the duel, which is followed by Declan. Unfortunately, before Leo can use the four Natural Energy cards necessary to defeat Zarc, Zarc uses a trap card to destroy it together with Leo.

Zarc summons all of his Supreme King Dragons and swiftly defeats Declan as Ray joins the duel through Riley's body. Ray proceeds to retrieve the four Natural Energy cards from Leo's graveyard to negate Z-ARC's Fusion, Sychro, and Xyz attributes to significantly weaken him and destroy his Supreme Dragon form. Despite Z-ARC's insistence that Yuya is no more, Ray reveals that Pendulum Summon was created from both Zarc's vengeful desires and the power of the four Natural Energy cards themselves. Zuzu briefly manifests separately to reach Yuya within his mind and remind him of his desire and promise to her. With Yuya's counterparts supporting him, Yuya musters the strength to regain control over himself to place Zarc at a greater disadvantage for Ray to finish the duel.

Yuya manages to win by using a Odd-Eyes Lancer Dragon's damage halving ability in conjunction with a trap card to inflict damage on both himself and Shay. Despite being defeated, Shay reveals that he briefly sensed Yuto within Yuya, which gave him hope that Lulu may still exist within Ray. Jack suddenly appears and tells Yuya he will not be able save anyone in his current state.\n| LineColor       = 006600\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh!

Yuya admits it out of concern for Riley's well being while expressing his intent to save the baby without the dragons' power. Declan reveals that Yuya's last two matches had no impact on Riley. He activates the Dimension Highway duel course installed in the Arc-V remains so everyone can watch the Turbo Duel between Yuya and Jack. Despite placing himself at a grave disadvantage, Yuya still refused to use the dragons as they might hasten Zarc's return with grave consequences for Ray and her incarnations. Yuto, Yugo, and Yuri finally make their presence known to Yuya. They urge him to hear their dragons' true feelings and help him remember Zarc's ability to communicate with Duel Monster Spirits. Yuya finally summons the four dragons and learns the dragons' desire to be merged is not of Zarc's will but from their own fear of Ray. Yuya calms the four dragons with the intent to show them that they are strong as they are without the need to become Supreme King Z-ARC.\n| LineColor       = 006600\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh!

Even after defeating Jack, who tells him that he is still lacking something, Yuya learns from Declan that Z-ARC's soul still remains inside Riley and had started to stir. After Yuya is promoted to Senior Class by Declan, he is allowed to take the Professional Duelist test. Yuya requests to take the Professional Duelist test right away with Declan as his opponent. Yuya once again summons the four dragons on his first turn to fight against Declan's trio of D/D/D Doom King Armageddons. He coordinates the four dragons to retrieve Action Cards to survive Declan's attacks. The happiness Yuya felt from understanding the dragons causes him to experience one of Zarc's memories. From seeing Zarc as one of the first Dueltainers who wanted to entertain for sake of making others smile, Yuya realizes that Zarc was not truly evil at heart and his true wish is to give people happiness. Regardless, Yuya finds Declan summoning his three D/D/D Superdoom King Armageddon monsters to counter the four dragons.\n| LineColor       = 006600\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh!

With Yuto, Yugo, and Yuri's support, Yuya performs Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz summons to summon Odd-Eyes Venom Dragon, Odd-Eyes Wing Dragon, and Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon in that order. He manages to deal considerable damage to Declan, but he failed to destroy his monsters. Yuya uses the Pendulum ability of Performapal Five-Rainbow Magician to make both of their monsters' attack points go zero and only by placing five Action Cards on the field face down, the monsters' attack points would be doubled. Yuya and Declan begin racing who can place five Action Cards face down first by picking Action Cards. Yuya succeeded in place the five Action Cards ahead, but Declan also activates his D/D Savant Einstein\u2019s special ability to place his last Action Card face down and doubled his monsters' attack points that overpowers Yuya's. Already anticipating this, Yuya uses his monster's Pendulum ability to increase Odd-Eyes' attack points for each Pendulum Monster on his field. With Odd-Eyes' effect doubling the damage, Yuya defeats Declan. Yuya's Dueltaining pacifies Zarc's soul and allows Riley to smile. Ray reacts to the Dueltainment and transports Yuya's friends across dimensions to the Pendulum Dimension, where she is finally revived as Zuzu, with her other reincarnations residing within her, and reunites with Yuya. In addition, the four dimensions are reunited into one dimension once more. Yusho challenges Yuya to a duel because Yuya has officially become a professional duelist. As Yuya accepts his father's challenge, Yuya declares he will continue bringing smiles with his dueling and surpass his father as a Dueltainer.\n| LineColor       = 006600\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"n\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Yu-Gi-Oh!}}\n\n[[Category:Yu-Gi-Oh! seasons|Arc-V (season 3)]]\n", "name_user": "WereSpielChequers", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_Arc-V_(season_3)"}

A missile system that can be dispersed far and wide in the Indian mainland, its far flung islands or its blue water naval assets dispersed across the world's oceans. Following this necessity India developed a larger Agni-III missile, with a heavier payload and a longer range but in a compact configuration, i.e. thicker but shorter length. This development is driven by need for a more assured retaliation that can defeat emerging [[anti ballistic missile]] (ABM) defence and countermeasures. Such capability requires a compact missile that can also carry ABM counter-measure payloads along with weapons, in a configuration similar to a [[MIRV]], albeit with state-of-the-art decoys.\n\n==Description==\nAgni III was developed as the successor to [[Agni-II]].<ref name=\"expressindia.com\"/> Designed by the [[Government of India|Indian government's]] [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]], Agni III is a [[Multistage rocket|two-stage]] [[ballistic missile]] that is capable of [[nuclear weapons delivery]]. It was designed and developed by the Advanced Systems Laboratory (ASL),{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} a unit of DRDO, which was formed in September 2001 with its main objective being the development of large-sized rocket motors. ASL developed the propulsion plant for solid-fuel motors, including the infrastructure for propellant casting. The stubby two-stage solid fuel missile is compact and small enough for easy mobility and flexible deployment on various surface/sub-surface platforms.<ref name=hindu2636571>{{cite news|title=New kid on the nuclear block|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/article2636571.ece|accessdate=4 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=18 November 2011|location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\nThe missile is equipped with sophisticated navigation, guidance and control systems along with advanced on-board computer systems.

A missile system that can be dispersed far and wide in the Indian mainland, its far flung islands or its blue water naval assets dispersed across the world's oceans. Following this necessity India developed a larger Agni-III missile, with a heavier payload and a longer range but in a compact configuration, i.e. thicker but shorter length. This development is driven by need for a more assured retaliation that can defeat emerging [[anti ballistic missile]] (ABM) defence and countermeasures. Such capability requires a compact missile that can also carry ABM counter-measure payloads along with weapons, in a configuration similar to a [[MIRV]], albeit with state-of-the-art decoys.\n\n==Description==\nAgni III was developed as the successor to [[Agni-II]].<ref name=\"expressindia.com\"/> Designed by the [[Government of India|Indian government's]] [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]], Agni III is a [[Multistage rocket|two-stage]] [[ballistic missile]] that is capable of [[nuclear weapons delivery]]. It was designed and developed by the Advanced Systems Laboratory (ASL),{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} a unit of DRDO, which was formed in September 2001 with its main objective being the development of large-sized rocket motors. ASL developed the propulsion plant for solid-fuel motors, including the infrastructure for propellant casting.

{"title_page": "Declarations of war during World War II", "text_new": "[[File:Second world war europe animation small.gif|thumb|250px|Animated map of the [[European theatre of World War II|European theatre of war during WWII]]]]\nThis is a timeline of formal '''declarations of War during [[World War II]]'''.\n\nA [[declaration of war]] is a formal act by which one nation goes to war against another.  The declaration is usually an act of delivering a performative speech (not to be confused with a mere ''speech'') or the presentation of a signed document by an authorized party of a national government in order to create a [[War|state of war]] between two or more sovereign states.  The official international protocol for declaring war was defined in [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|The Hague Peace Conference of 1907]] (or Hague II).<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague03.asp ''On the Opening of Hostilities'']; 1907; [[Yale]] Law School Library; retrieved March 2014.</ref>  For the diplomatic maneuvering behind these events, which led to hostilities between nations during World War II, see the article entitled [[Diplomatic history of World War II]].\n\n==List of war declarations==\nBelow is a table showing the outbreak of wars between nations which occurred during World War II.  Indicated are the dates (during the immediate build-up to, or during the course of, [[World War II]]), from which a ''[[de facto]]'' [[War|state of war]] existed between nations.  The table shows both the \"Initiator Nation(s)\" and the nation at which the aggression was aimed, or \"Targeted Nation(s)\".  Events listed include those in which there were simple diplomatic breaking of relations that did not involve any physical attack, as well as those involving overt declarations or acts of aggression. In rare cases, war between two nations occurred twice, with an intermittent period of peace. The list here does not include peace treaties or periods of any armistice.\n\nTable Legend: Concerning Declaration of War:  '''A''' = Attack without prior, formal declaration of war; '''U''' = State of war arrived at through use of ultimatum; <br>'''W''' = Formal declaration of war made.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Outbreaks of war between nations during World War II\n|-\n!Date!!Initiator nation(s)!!Targeted nation(s)!!Declaration of war: Type!!Notes/comments!!Document/event\n|-\n|1939-09-01 ||{{flagicon|Nazi Germany}} [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]||{{flagdeco|Poland|1928}} [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]|| U<ref name=\"Days\">\"2194 Days of War\"; (1977); Salmaggi, C. & Pallasvini, A.; {{ISBN|91-582-0426-1}}; per tables included.

The declaration is usually an act of delivering a performative speech (not to be confused with a mere ''speech'') or the presentation of a signed document by an authorized party of a national government in order to create a [[War|state of war]] between two or more sovereign states.  The official international protocol for declaring war was defined in [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|The Hague Peace Conference of 1907]] (or Hague II).<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hague03.asp ''On the Opening of Hostilities'']; 1907; [[Yale]] Law School Library; retrieved March 2014.</ref>  For the diplomatic maneuvering behind these events, which led to hostilities between nations during World War II, see the article entitled [[Diplomatic history of World War II]].\n\n==List of war declarations==\nBelow is a table showing the outbreak of wars between nations which occurred during World War II.  Indicated are the dates (during the immediate build-up to, or during the course of, [[World War II]]), from which a ''[[de facto]]'' [[War|state of war]] existed between nations.  The table shows both the \"Initiator Nation(s)\" and the nation at which the aggression was aimed, or \"Targeted Nation(s)\".  Events listed include those in which there were simple diplomatic breaking of relations that did not involve any physical attack, as well as those involving overt declarations or acts of aggression. In rare cases, war between two nations occurred twice, with an intermittent period of peace. The list here does not include peace treaties or periods of any armistice.\n\n\nTable Legend: Concerning Declaration of War:  '''A''' = Attack without prior, formal declaration of war; '''U''' = State of war arrived at through use of ultimatum; <br>'''W''' = Formal declaration of war made.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+Outbreaks of war between nations during World War II\n|-\n!Date!!Initiator nation(s)!!Targeted nation(s)!!Declaration of war: Type!!Notes/comments!!Document/event\n|-\n|1939-09-01 ||{{flagicon|Nazi Germany}} [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]||{{flagdeco|Poland|1928}} [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]]|| U<ref name=\"Days\">\"2194 Days of War\"; (1977); Salmaggi, C. & Pallasvini, A.; {{ISBN|91-582-0426-1}}; per tables included.

This is an [[National Electrical Code|NEC]] requirement that ensures that in the event of a blackout, the grid tie inverter will shut down to prevent the energy it produces from harming any line workers who are sent to fix the [[power grid]].\n\nGrid-tie inverters that are available on the market today use a number of different technologies. The inverters may use the newer high-frequency [[transformer]]s, conventional low-frequency [[transformer]]s, or no transformer. Instead of converting direct current directly to 120 or 240&nbsp;volts AC, high-frequency transformers employ a computerized multi-step process that involves converting the power to high-frequency AC and then back to DC and then to the final AC output voltage.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Photovoltaics: Design and Installation Manual| last=| first=| year=2004| authorlink=Solar Energy International| page=80| publisher=Newsociety Publishers}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, there have been concerns about having transformerless electrical systems feed into the public utility grid. The concerns stem from the fact that there is a lack of [[galvanic isolation]] between the DC and AC circuits, which could allow the passage of dangerous DC faults to the AC side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/inverter_ii_workshop.pdf|title=Summary Report on the DOE High-tech Inverter Workshop|publisher=eere.energy.gov|accessdate=2011-06-10|work=Sponsored by the US Department of Energy, prepared by McNeil Technologies|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227145827/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/inverter_ii_workshop.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-27}}</ref> Since 2005, the NFPA's NEC allows transformer-less (or non-galvanically) inverters. The VDE 0126-1-1 and IEC 6210 also have been amended to allow and define the safety mechanisms needed for such systems. Primarily, residual or ground current detection is used to detect possible fault conditions. Also isolation tests are performed to ensure DC to AC separation.\n\nMany solar inverters are designed to be connected to a utility grid, and will not operate when they do not detect the presence of the grid. They contain special circuitry to precisely match the voltage, [[Utility frequency|frequency]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the grid.\n\n== Solar pumping inverters ==\nAdvanced solar pumping inverters convert DC voltage from the solar array into AC voltage to drive [[submersible pump]]s directly without the need for batteries or other energy storage devices. By utilizing MPPT (maximum power point tracking), solar pumping inverters regulate output frequency to control the speed of the pumps in order to save the pump motor from damage.\n\nSolar pumping inverters usually have multiple ports to allow the input of DC current generated by PV arrays, one port to allow the output of AC voltage, and a further port for input from a water-level sensor.\n\n== Market ==\nAs of 2014, conversion efficiency for state-of-the-art solar converters reached more than 98 percent. While string inverters are used in residential to medium-sized commercial [[PV systems]], central inverters cover the large commercial and utility-scale market. Market-share for central and string inverters are about 50 percent and 48 percent, respectively, leaving less than 2 percent to micro-inverters.<ref name=\"fraunhofer-report-september-2014\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Inverter/converter market in 2014\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Type\n! scope=\"col\" | Power\n! scope=\"col\" | Efficiency<sup>(a)</sup>\n! scope=\"col\" | Market<br />share<sup>(b)</sup>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 45%;\" | Remarks\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | String inverter\n| up to 100&nbsp;kW<sub>p</sub><sup>(c)</sup>\n| 98%\n| 50%\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Cost<sup>(b)</sup> \u20ac0.15 per watt-peak.

This is an [[National Electrical Code|NEC]] requirement that ensures that in the event of a blackout, the grid tie inverter will shut down to prevent the energy it produces from harming any line workers who are sent to fix the [[power grid]].\n\nGrid-tie inverters that are available on the market today use a number of different technologies. The inverters may use the newer high-frequency [[transformer]]s, conventional low-frequency [[transformer]]s, or no transformer. Instead of converting direct current directly to 120 or 240&nbsp;volts AC, high-frequency transformers employ a computerized multi-step process that involves converting the power to high-frequency AC and then back to DC and then to the final AC output voltage.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Photovoltaics: Design and Installation Manual| last=| first=| year=2004| authorlink=Solar Energy International| page=80| publisher=Newsociety Publishers}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, there have been concerns about having transformerless electrical systems feed into the public utility grid. The concerns stem from the fact that there is a lack of [[galvanic isolation]] between the DC and AC circuits, which could allow the passage of dangerous DC faults to the AC side.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/inverter_ii_workshop.pdf|title=Summary Report on the DOE High-tech Inverter Workshop|publisher=eere.energy.gov|accessdate=2011-06-10|work=Sponsored by the US Department of Energy, prepared by McNeil Technologies|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227145827/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/inverter_ii_workshop.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-27}}</ref> Since 2005, the NFPA's NEC allows transformer-less (or non-galvanically) inverters. The VDE 0126-1-1 and IEC 6210 also have been amended to allow and define the safety mechanisms needed for such systems. Primarily, residual or ground current detection is used to detect possible fault conditions. Also isolation tests are performed to ensure DC to AC separation.\n\nMany solar inverters are designed to be connected to a utility grid, and will not operate when they do not detect the presence of the grid. They contain special circuitry to precisely match the voltage, [[Utility frequency|frequency]] and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the grid.\n\n== Solar pumping inverters ==\nAdvanced solar pumping inverters convert DC voltage from the solar array into AC voltage to drive [[submersible pump]]s directly without the need for batteries or other energy storage devices. By utilizing MPPT (maximum power point tracking), solar pumping inverters regulate output frequency to control the speed of the pumps in order to save the pump motor from damage.\n\nSolar pumping inverters usually have multiple ports to allow the input of DC current generated by PV arrays, one port to allow the output of AC voltage, and a further port for input from a water-level sensor.\n\n== Market ==\nAs of 2014, conversion efficiency for state-of-the-art solar converters reached more than 98 percent. While string inverters are used in residential to medium-sized commercial [[PV systems]], central inverters cover the large commercial and utility-scale market. Market-share for central and string inverters are about 50 percent and 48 percent, respectively, leaving less than 2 percent to micro-inverters.<ref name=\"fraunhofer-report-september-2014\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Inverter/converter market in 2014\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Type\n! scope=\"col\" | Power\n! scope=\"col\" | Efficiency<sup>(a)</sup>\n! scope=\"col\" | Market<br />share<sup>(b)</sup>\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 45%;\" | Remarks\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | String inverter\n| up to 100&nbsp;kW<sub>p</sub><sup>(c)</sup>\n| 98%\n| 50%\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Cost<sup>(b)</sup> \u20ac0.15 per watt-peak.
