It was released on November 6, 2007, by CBE, [[Jive Records]]. The record serves as Chris Brown's second studio release under his CBE [[record label]], Jive. The record also serves as the follow-up from his multi-platinum selling debut album, ''[[Chris Brown (album)|Chris Brown]]'' (2005). The album debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 295,000 copies in the first week. The album was supported by five [[Single (music)|singles]], with three of the singles becoming top three hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and also charting highly on other charts worldwide. The album earned a triple platinum certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in the United States.\n\nOn June 3, 2008, ''Exclusive'' was re-released into a double-disc [[special edition|deluxe edition]], which includes a counterparts from the DVD, featuring the behind-the-scenes footage and its [[music video]]s from his tour.\n\n==Singles==\nThe album's lead [[Single (music)|single]], \"[[Wall to Wall (song)|Wall to Wall]]\" was released on May 29, 2007. The song was produced by [[Sean Garrett]], written by Walter Scott. The single reached at number 79 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], due to no digital release for this single.\n\n\"[[Kiss Kiss (Chris Brown song)|Kiss Kiss]]\"; a collaboration with a fellow American recording artist [[T-Pain]], was released as the album's second single on September 11, 2007. Following the non-success of his first single, this single became a big success in the United States. The song reached at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and number 6 on the [[Canadian Hot 100]], also reaching the top ten in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]].\n\n\"[[With You (Chris Brown song)|With You]]\" was released as the album's third single on December 4, 2007. The song was produced by the production team [[Stargate (production team)|StarGate]]. The single became his second successful single in the most international music markets. It has since become one of the highest-charting singles of Brown's solo career, entering the foreign music markets, where his previous efforts have failed to these charts. It has reached the top ten; including in Australia, Canada, [[Ireland]], New Zealand, and [[United Kingdom]].\n\nThe re-release of its first single from ''The Forever Edition'', called \"[[Forever (Chris Brown song)|Forever]]\" (produced by [[Polow da Don]]). It was released on April 29, 2008. The song debuted at number 9 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, due of its high digital sales. However, it dropped quickly due to the lack of sales during these following weeks. The song then re-entered the top ten again, after airplay increases and has peaked at number 2.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 69/100<ref>{{cite web|title=Reviews for Exclusive by Chris Brown|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/exclusive/chris-brown|website=Metacritic|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Kellman\">Kellman, Andy.

Rob Sheffield from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said that \u201cIt's been a long stretch between [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] albums \u2014 long enough for Chris Brown to build a whole career, growing from a temporary substitute to an undeniably major pop star. He seals the deal with ''Exclusive'', an all-grown-up album on a level with [[Justin Timberlake]]'s ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'' (2002), [[Rihanna]]'s ''[[Good Girl Gone Bad]]'' (2007) or even [[Bobby Brown]]'s ''[[King of Stage]]'' (1986), and gave the album three and a half out of five stars.<ref name=\"Sheffield\"/>\n\nNeil Drumming from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' rated the album as B- said that, \"Like his onscreen (''[[This Christmas (film)|This Christmas]]'') character, Brown is most charming when he's playing up his youth: singing of MySpace romance, meeting his girl's 'pops,' and such\". But he also said, \"sadly, Brown's adolescent voice and playful scatting \u2014 while cute \u2014 are steamrolled by pushy collaborators, whether it's those Stargate guys ([[Ne-Yo]], [[Rihanna]]) falling back on that ol' guitar noodling, or [[T-Pain]] milking his vocoder. Ease back, people, and let the boy sing\".<ref name=\"Drumming\"/> However, Sal Cinquemani of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' criticized the unoriginality of the album, writing, \"...there's still nothing very 'exclusive' about ''Exclusive'' at all.\"<ref name=\"Cinquemani\"/> [[Michael Arceneaux]] of ''[[PopMatters]]'' wrote, \"''Exclusive'' seems aimless, an album where Brown is doing what he\u2019s told versus being the anchor of his own ship.\"<ref name=\"Arceneaux\"/> The album ranked number 34 on ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s list of the Top 50 Albums of 2007.<ref>Robert Christgau, David Fricke, Christian Hoard, Rob Sheffield (December 17, 2010).

It was released on November 6, 2007, by CBE, [[Jive Records]]. The record serves as Chris Brown's second studio release under his CBE [[record label]], Jive. The record also serves as the follow-up from his multi-platinum selling debut album, ''[[Chris Brown (album)|Chris Brown]]'' (2005). The album debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 295,000 copies in the first week. The album was supported by five [[Single (music)|singles]], with three of the singles becoming top three hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and also charting highly on other charts worldwide. The album earned a triple platinum certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in the United States.\n\nOn June 3, 2008, ''Exclusive'' was re-released into a double-disc [[special edition|deluxe edition]], which includes a counterparts from the DVD, featuring the behind-the-scenes footage and its [[music video]]s from his tour.\n\n==Singles==\nThe album's lead [[Single (music)|single]], \"[[Wall to Wall (song)|Wall to Wall]]\" was released on May 29, 2007. The song was produced by [[Sean Garrett]], written by Walter Scott. The single reached at number 79 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], due to no digital release for this single.\n\n\"[[Kiss Kiss (Chris Brown song)|Kiss Kiss]]\"; a collaboration with a fellow American recording artist [[T-Pain]], was released as the album's second single on September 11, 2007. Following the non-success of his first single, this single became a big success in the United States. The song reached at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and number 6 on the [[Canadian Hot 100]], also reaching the top ten in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]].\n\n\"[[With You (Chris Brown song)|With You]]\" was released as the album's third single on December 4, 2007. The song was produced by the production team [[Stargate (production team)|StarGate]]. The single became his second successful single in the most international music markets. It has since become one of the highest-charting singles of Brown's solo career, entering the foreign music markets, where his previous efforts have failed to these charts. It has reached the top ten; including in Australia, Canada, [[Ireland]], New Zealand, and [[United Kingdom]].\n\nThe re-release of its first single from ''The Forever Edition'', called \"[[Forever (Chris Brown song)|Forever]]\" (produced by [[Polow da Don]]). It was released on April 29, 2008. The song debuted at number 9 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, due of its high digital sales. However, it dropped quickly due to the lack of sales during these following weeks. The song then re-entered the top ten again, after airplay increases and has peaked at number 2.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC = 69/100<ref>{{cite web|title=Reviews for Exclusive by Chris Brown|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/exclusive/chris-brown|website=Metacritic|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref>\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Kellman\">Kellman, Andy.

But he also said, \"sadly, Brown's adolescent voice and playful scatting \u2014 while cute \u2014 are steamrolled by pushy collaborators, whether it's those Stargate guys ([[Ne-Yo]], [[Rihanna]]) falling back on that ol' guitar noodling, or [[T-Pain]] milking his vocoder.

A female militia leader ate 6 human livers in total, and cut the genitals of 5 men and soaked them in alcohol which she would drink later, claiming that these organs were beneficial to her health. The behavior of eating human flesh, hearts and livers occurred in many counties of Guangxi including Wuxuan, [[Wuming District|Wuming]], [[Shangsi County|Shangsi]], Guigang, [[Qinzhou]], [[Guiping]], and [[Lingyun County|Lingyun]]......After the \"Committee of Revolution\" was established in Shangsi County, a \"killing conference\" was held at Pingshan Square ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u5e73\u5c71\u5e7f\u573a}}) on September 1, 1968, during which more than 10 officials and civilians were beaten to death.

There was one man who was said to be in the so-called fifth category, who was beaten to death where he stood. He had two kids, one of 11 and one of 14. The local officials and armed militia said that it was important to eradicate such people, and so they not only killed those two children: they ate them too. This took place in [[Pubei County|Pubei county]], Guangxi, where 35 people were killed and eaten in total. Most of them were rich landowners and their families. There was one landowner called Liu Zhengjian whose entire family was wiped out. He had a 17-year-old daughter, Liu Xiulan, who was gang-raped by nine people [for 19 times] who then ripped open her belly, and ate her liver and breasts.
