Vista is a medium-sized city within the [[San Diego-Carlsbad, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area|San Diego-Carlsbad, CA Metropolitan Area]] and has a population of 101,659. Vista's [[sphere of influence]] also includes portions of unincorporated San Diego County to north and east, with a [[county island]] in the central west.<ref>http://www.sdlafco.org/images/11x17maps/City_Vista.pdf</ref> Located just seven miles inland from the Pacific Ocean, it has a [[Mediterranean climate]].\n\nOriginally the lands of [[Rancho Buena Vista (Felipe)|Rancho Buena Vista]] and [[Rancho Guajome]], Vista was founded on October 9, 1882 with the establishment of a [[post office]].<ref>Cavalier, Lois. ''Images of America:Vista.'' Arcadia Publishing, 2008, p.20.</ref> It was incorporated on January 28, 1963 and became a [[charter city]] on June 13, 2007.\n\nVista has more than 25 educational institutions for youth, and a business park home to over 800 companies. Vista is ranked as the 173rd-best place in California out of 240 for families, based on factors such as family life, recreational opportunities, education, health, safety, and affordability in a 2015 review.<ref>[https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-cities-for-families-in-california/15993/ 2015's Best & Worst Cities for Family Life 2015] Richie Bernardo</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rancho Guajome 1-1.jpg|thumb|left|Rancho Guajome, Vista circa 1936]]\nThe Vista area was originally inhabited by the [[Luise\u00f1o people|Luise\u00f1o Indians]], who lived on the land until the founding of the [[Mission San Luis Rey de Francia|San Luis Rey Mission]] in 1798. The prosperity of the mission-era declined by the 1830s with the [[Mexican War of Independence|independence of Mexico]] from Spain. The Mexican government began to grant land ownerships to a variety of people, thus beginning the Rancho era of California. Three ranchos were granted in the Vista area: [[Rancho Guajome]], [[Rancho Buena Vista (Felipe)|Rancho Buena Vista]], and [[Rancho Agua Hedionda|Agua Hedionda Y los Manos]].<ref>Doyle, Harrison and Ruth.''A History of Vista,''Hillside Press,1983. p.4-5</ref>\n\nIn the 1850s the ranchos began to fade due to changing political conditions and the scarcity of water. A growing number of settlers came to the area after California became a state in 1850 and began to create smaller agricultural holdings. One settler in the Vista area, John Frazier, applied to open the first post office and after several attempts to name the city (Frazier's Crossing and [[Buena Vista, Amador County, California|Buena Vista]] were already taken), Frazier finally chose the name \"Vista\". With the opening of the first post office in 1882, Vista had officially arrived.<ref>Doyle,''A History of Vista,''p.36</ref>\n\nIn 1870, Bernard Delpy arrived from France to build what eventually became known as \"Delpy Corners\" at the intersection of today's East Vista Way and Foothill Drive.  His nephew, Jules Jacques Delpy, joined him in 1879 and together they planted several hundred acres of grapes.  In 1886, they built the first successful winery in the country.  The winery was shut down by the prohibition era.<ref>Doyle,''A History of Vista,''p.28</ref>\n\nInhibited by the lack of water, Vista grew slowly through the early 1910s to less than 1,000 people. With the vote of the people in 1923, the Vista Irrigation District had the necessary funding to construct a new water supply from [[Lake Henshaw]].<ref>Doyle,''A History of Vista,''p.38</ref> New buildings in downtown sprang up almost immediately. Agriculture began to flourish with crops such as tomatoes, celery, and citrus fruits. Some hillsides were also planted for avocados and by 1948, the Vista became the \"avocado capital of the world\"<ref>Doyle,''A History of Vista,''p.39</ref>\n\nFollowing World War II, agriculture declined with an influx of growth of population and housing. The City of Vista was incorporated on January 23, 1963. The frequent housing booms of the 1970s through early 2000s greatly increased the population of Vista. Numerous apartment complexes were also built in these booms. Many light manufacturing businesses moved into the Business Park area on the south side, starting in the 1980s. In the 1990s, Wal-Mart, Target and Costco opened large stores. In 1993, Vista became involved in a national controversy when the Vista Unified School District board unsuccessfully tried to incorporate creationist, anti-evolution views into the biology curriculum.<ref>Granberry, Michael. [http://articles.latimes.com/1993-05-20/news/mn-37423_1_school-board-members.html \"School Board's Creationist Trend Causes Stir in Vista], ''[[L.A. Times]]'', May 20, 1993.</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Brengle Terrace Park.JPG|thumb|Brengle Terrace Park.]]According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|18.7|sqmi|km2}}, all land. Vista is a hilly city. Most of the businesses are located in the flatter areas, and residences climb the hills. In undeveloped areas, the natural vegetation types includes chaparral brushland, oak-sycamore woodland, riparian (stream) woodland and oak-grass savanna. The natural vegetation is best seen in natural Buena Vista Park on the south side, in the San Marcos Hills east of the city, and in undeveloped pockets on the north side (e.g. along Gopher Canyon Road and Guajome Regional Park).\n\n===Climate===\nClimate is temperate, with extremes of temperature uncommon. Coastal breezes and foggy overcast (especially in May and June) keep the late spring/early summer high temperatures below {{convert|80|F|}}. on most days. The cool, overcast conditions are often called \"May gray\" and \"June gloom\" by Vistans. In general, the western side of the city (closer to the Pacific) is cooler and more overcast with ocean fog than the eastern side. It is common in May\u2013June for the western side of Vista to be overcast and cool, while the eastern side basks in clear skies and sunshine. July, August and September are usually warmer, as the coastal breezes lessen. High temperatures in excess of {{convert|90|F|}}. (rarely above {{convert|100|F|}}) sometimes occur in late summer. High temperatures also accompany dry Santa Ana wind events, which can strike any month, but are most common during fall. On 90% of days, though, the moderating influence of the nearby Pacific keeps the weather pleasant and temperatures moderate. Frost is quite rare in winter, and snowfall almost unknown. Most of the annual rainfall of {{convert|13.24|in|}} falls between November and April (Mediterranean climate type). Rainfall is higher in the San Marcos Hills on the eastern edge of the city, up to {{convert|20|in|}} per year. The moderate climate has made Vista and surrounding areas a center of the plant nursery industry. Avocados and other subtropical plants thrive in the area. \n \n{{Weather box|location = Vista, California\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high F = 67\n|Feb high F = 66\n|Mar high F = 67\n|Apr high F = 71\n|May high F = 72\n|Jun high F = 76\n|Jul high F = 80\n|Aug high F = 82\n|Sep high F = 81\n|Oct high F = 77\n|Nov high F = 71\n|Dec high F = 66\n|year high F = 73.0\n|Jan record high F = 90\n|Feb record high F = 93\n|Mar record high F = 96\n|Apr record high F = 115\n|May record high F = 99\n|Jun record high F = 108\n|Jul record high F = 107\n|Aug record high F = 106\n|Sep record high F = 107\n|Oct record high F = 104\n|Nov record high F = 97\n|Dec record high F = 90\n|year record high F = 108\n|Jan record low F = 20\n|Feb record low F = 29\n|Mar record low F = 25\n|Apr record low F = 35\n|May record low F = 38\n|Jun record low F = 30\n|Jul record low F = 44\n|Aug record low F = 45\n|Sep record low F = 39\n|Oct record low F = 36\n|Nov record low F = 29\n|Dec record low F = 23\n|year record low F = 20\n|Jan low F = 46\n|Feb low F = 46\n|Mar low F = 48\n|Apr low F = 50\n|May low F = 55\n|Jun low F = 58\n|Jul low F = 62\n|Aug low F = 63\n|Sep low F = 61\n|Oct low F = 56\n|Nov low F = 50\n|Dec low F = 45\n|year low F = 53.3\n<!-- Mean daily temperature -->\n|Jan mean F=57\n|Feb mean F=56\n|Mar mean F=58\n|Apr mean F=61\n|May mean F=64\n|Jun mean F=67\n|Jul mean F=71\n|Aug mean F=73\n|Sep mean F=71\n|Oct mean F=67\n|Nov mean F=61\n|Dec mean F=56\n|year mean F=\n|Jan precipitation inch = 2.67\n|Feb precipitation inch = 3.08\n|Mar precipitation inch = 2.20\n|Apr precipitation inch = 0.99\n|May precipitation inch = 0.19\n|Jun precipitation inch = 0.10\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0.06\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0.05\n|Sep precipitation inch = 0.22\n|Oct precipitation inch = 0.63\n|Nov precipitation inch = 1.25\n|Dec precipitation inch = 1.80\n|year precipitation inch = 13.24\n|source 1 = weather.com<ref>[http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/92083 Average Weather for Vista, CA].Retrieved January 13, 2013</ref>\n|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1950= 1705\n|1960= 14795\n|1970= 24688\n|1980= 35834\n|1990= 71872\n|2000= 89857\n|2010= 93834\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=101224\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0682996|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140715040555/http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0682996|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2014|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Vista city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Vista had a population of 93,834.

The Avo Playhouse located in historic downtown Vista is rented year round for private performances.\n\nSeveral popular downtown events include the North County St. Patrick's Day Parade & Festival, the Vista Strawberry Festival, the Vista Rod Run (over 25 years running) and the annual Winterfest & Christmas Parade.\n\nVista houses one movie theater, currently a Cinepolis theater (as of 2015), but which opened as a Krikorian Cinema in fall 2003.\n\nTwo of the best-known parks in the city are Brengle Terrace Park and Guajome County Park. Brengle Terrace Park houses the Moonlight Amphitheatre, [[Alta Vista Gardens]] (a city-owned [[botanical garden]]), two softball fields, a senior center, a playground, and the city community center, where the main offices of the city's day camps are held. Guajome County Park has {{convert|557|acre|km2}} of land, which is shared between Vista and nearby Oceanside. It features a small lake, willow and oak woodlands,  campsites, [[horse]] trails, and the [[Rancho Guajome Adobe]], a [[National Historic Landmark]]. Buena Vista Park on the south side of Vista is a natural park where users can hike on trails through native chaparral and oak woodland.\n\nThe Rancho Guajome Adobe and Rancho Buena Vista Adobe are two historic rancho buildings in Vista, built in the mid-nineteenth century, both available for tours and special occasions.\n\nThe city's Parks and Recreation Department runs the Wave Waterpark, a small but well-equipped waterpark in the downtown area open from mid-spring to early fall, and the brand new Vista Community Sports Park.

Vista is a medium-sized city within the [[San Diego-Carlsbad, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area|San Diego-Carlsbad, CA Metropolitan Area]] and has a population of 101,659. Vista's [[sphere of influence]] also includes portions of unincorporated San Diego County to north and east, with a [[county island]] in the central west.<ref>http://www.sdlafco.org/images/11x17maps/City_Vista.pdf</ref> Located just seven miles inland from the Pacific Ocean, it has a [[Mediterranean climate]].\n\nOriginally the lands of [[Rancho Buena Vista (Felipe)|Rancho Buena Vista]] and [[Rancho Guajome]], Vista was founded on October 9, 1882 with the establishment of a [[post office]].<ref>Cavalier, Lois. ''Images of America:Vista.'' Arcadia Publishing, 2008, p.20.</ref> It was incorporated on January 28, 1963 and became a [[charter city]] on June 13, 2007.\n\nVista has more than 25 educational institutions for youth, and a business park home to over 800 companies. Vista is ranked as the 173rd-best place in California out of 240 for families, based on factors such as family life, recreational opportunities, education, health, safety, and affordability in a 2015 review.<ref>[https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-cities-for-families-in-california/15993/ 2015's Best & Worst Cities for Family Life 2015] Richie Bernardo</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rancho Guajome 1-1.jpg|thumb|left|Rancho Guajome, Vista circa 1936]]\nThe Vista area was originally inhabited by the [[Luise\u00f1o people|Luise\u00f1o Indians]], who lived on the land until the founding of the [[Mission San Luis Rey de Francia|San Luis Rey Mission]] in 1798. The prosperity of the mission-era declined by the 1830s with the [[Mexican War of Independence|independence of Mexico]] from Spain. The Mexican government began to grant land ownerships to a variety of people, thus beginning the Rancho era of California. Three ranchos were granted in the Vista area: [[Rancho Guajome]], [[Rancho Buena Vista (Felipe)|Rancho Buena Vista]], and [[Rancho Agua Hedionda|Agua Hedionda Y los Manos]].<ref>Doyle, Harrison and Ruth.''A History of Vista,''Hillside Press,1983. p.4-5</ref>\n\nIn the 1850s the ranchos began to fade due to changing political conditions and the scarcity of water. A growing number of settlers came to the area after California became a state in 1850 and began to create smaller agricultural holdings. One settler in the Vista area, John Frazier, applied to open the first post office and after several attempts to name the city (Frazier's Crossing and [[Buena Vista, Amador County, California|Buena Vista]] were already taken), Frazier finally chose the name \"Vista\". With the opening of the first post office in 1882, Vista had officially arrived.<ref>Doyle,''A History of Vista,''p.36</ref>\n\nIn 1870, Bernard Delpy arrived from France to build what eventually became known as \"Delpy Corners\" at the intersection of today's East Vista Way and Foothill Drive.  His nephew, Jules Jacques Delpy, joined him in 1879 and together they planted several hundred acres of grapes.  In 1886, they built the first successful winery in the country.  The winery was shut down by the prohibition era.<ref>Doyle,''A History of Vista,''p.28</ref>\n\nInhibited by the lack of water, Vista grew slowly through the early 1910s to less than 1,000 people. With the vote of the people in 1923, the Vista Irrigation District had the necessary funding to construct a new water supply from [[Lake Henshaw]].<ref>Doyle,''A History of Vista,''p.38</ref> New buildings in downtown sprang up almost immediately. Agriculture began to flourish with crops such as tomatoes, celery, and citrus fruits. Some hillsides were also planted for avocados and by 1948, the Vista became the \"avocado capital of the world\"<ref>Doyle,''A History of Vista,''p.39</ref>\n\nFollowing World War II, agriculture declined with an influx of growth of population and housing. The City of Vista was incorporated on January 23, 1963. The frequent housing booms of the 1970s through early 2000s greatly increased the population of Vista. Numerous apartment complexes were also built in these booms. Many light manufacturing businesses moved into the Business Park area on the south side, starting in the 1980s. In the 1990s, Wal-Mart, Target and Costco opened large stores. In 1993, Vista became involved in a national controversy when the Vista Unified School District board unsuccessfully tried to incorporate creationist, anti-evolution views into the biology curriculum.<ref>Granberry, Michael. [http://articles.latimes.com/1993-05-20/news/mn-37423_1_school-board-members.html \"School Board's Creationist Trend Causes Stir in Vista], ''[[L.A. Times]]'', May 20, 1993.</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n[[File:Brengle Terrace Park.JPG|thumb|Brengle Terrace Park.]]According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|18.7|sqmi|km2}}, all land. Vista is a hilly city. Most of the businesses are located in the flatter areas, and residences climb the hills. In undeveloped areas, the natural vegetation types includes chaparral brushland, oak-sycamore woodland, riparian (stream) woodland and oak-grass savanna. The natural vegetation is best seen in natural Buena Vista Park on the south side, in the San Marcos Hills east of the city, and in undeveloped pockets on the north side (e.g. along Gopher Canyon Road and Guajome Regional Park).\n\n===Climate===\nClimate is temperate, with extremes of temperature uncommon. Coastal breezes and foggy overcast (especially in May and June) keep the late spring/early summer high temperatures below {{convert|80|F|}}. on most days. The cool, overcast conditions are often called \"May gray\" and \"June gloom\" by Vistans. In general, the western side of the city (closer to the Pacific) is cooler and more overcast with ocean fog than the eastern side. It is common in May\u2013June for the western side of Vista to be overcast and cool, while the eastern side basks in clear skies and sunshine. July, August and September are usually warmer, as the coastal breezes lessen. High temperatures in excess of {{convert|90|F|}}. (rarely above {{convert|100|F|}}) sometimes occur in late summer. High temperatures also accompany dry Santa Ana wind events, which can strike any month, but are most common during fall. On 90% of days, though, the moderating influence of the nearby Pacific keeps the weather pleasant and temperatures moderate. Frost is quite rare in winter, and snowfall almost unknown. Most of the annual rainfall of {{convert|13.24|in|}} falls between November and April (Mediterranean climate type).

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.
