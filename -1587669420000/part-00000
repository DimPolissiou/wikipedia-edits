The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1972, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> \n\nBanneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Opinion among the public was divided. The upper classes (the aristocracy and the rich bourgeoisie), the Catholic Church and the [[Spanish Army]] generally favoured the [[Central Powers]], usually identified with [[German Empire|Germany]]. Among political parties, the Germanophile tendency was represented among the reactionary [[Carlists]] and the conservative ''[[Mauristas]]'', followers of [[Antonio Maura]], who himself favoured closer ties with the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] because of Spain's [[Pact of Cartagena|1907 pact with Britain and France]], which was designed to head off German colonialism in north Africa. Pro-Allied sentiment, which was generally Francophile, was most common among the middle and professional classes and intellectuals. It was common among [[Catalan nationalists]], [[Radical Republican Party|Republicans]] and [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialists]]. A few [[Liberal Party (Spain, 1880)|Liberals]], including [[\u00c1lvaro de Figueroa]], leader of the opposition in the ''Cortes'', were also pro-Allied.{{sfn|Romero|1999|pp=32\u201334}}\n\nAs early as August 1914, some Spaniards were volunteering in the [[French Army]], mainly the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]]. In 1915, they founded their own magazine, ''Iberia'', to defend and propagate their cause. In February 1916, the ''Comit\u00e8 de Germanor'' (Committee of Brotherhood) was set up in Barcelona to recruit for the Legion. Over 2,000 Spaniards ultimately served in the Legion.{{sfn|Romero|1999|p=35}} King Alfonso XIII also tried to help in the war by creating the [[European War Office]].\n\nIn 1916, the Fernando Po Affair threatened the Spanish neutrality.{{sfn|Strachan|2003|pp=612}}{{sfn|Murphy|2014}}\n\n==Effects of war==\nThough it remained one of few neutral countries in mainland Europe, Spain was still affected by the conflict in a variety of ways. Spain had believed that by remaining neutral, the nation would potentially benefit by the end of the war and hoped to emerge with significantly-enhanced prestige and power in a postwar Europe.{{sfn|Lowry|2009|p=ii}} The conflict had some positive effects for the Spanish, particularly in its economy. The Spanish economy, which had previously begun to industrialise, benefited from increased exporting of goods to the belligerent nations, including products such as steel and foodstuffs.{{sfn|McEvoy|2003}} Moreover, Spain's gold reserves more than tripled over the course of the war, allowing the government to significantly reduce its debts.{{sfn|McEvoy|2003}}  \n\nHowever, Spain also experienced negative impacts resulting from the war. With regard to its economy, the Spanish maritime trade was significantly impacted by German U-Boat campaigns, with an estimated 100 lives and 66 ships lost to the submarines.{{sfn|Sanz|2018}} Though Spanish industry in the north and the east of the country, expanded as demand rose among the warring powers for Spanish goods, the inflow of capital produced inflation and imports dropped, exacerbating the poverty of the rural areas and the south. The growing poverty intensified internal migration to the industrial areas, and the railway system was unable to bear the increased demand. The shortage of basic commodities became known as the ''crisis de subsistencias''. In 1915, food riots erupted in some cities, and in December 1915, the government resigned, to be replaced by a Liberal government under Figueroa.{{sfn|Romero|1999|p=36}}\n\nIn July 1916, the two main trade unions, the socialist [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]] and the [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarchosyndicalist]] [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]], joined forces to put pressure on the Liberal government. In March 1917, they even threatened to start a [[general strike]]. Their example inspired military officers to form unions of their own, the ''juntas de defensa''. The officers' goal was to prevent the passage of the Bill of Military Reform tabled in the ''Cortes'' in 1916, that sought to professionalise the military by introducing intellectual and physical tests as prerequisites for promotions; the ultimate goal being a reduction in the size of the bloated officers corps. The ''juntas de defensa'' demanded promotions and pay increases based strictly on seniority.{{sfn|Romero|1999|p=37}}\n\nThe war also had a significant impact on the construction program of the [[Spanish Navy]]. The second and third {{sclass-|Espa\u00f1a|battleship}}s, built in Spain between 1910 and 1919, were delayed significantly because of material shortages from Britain.{{sfn|Fitzsimons|1979|p=856}} Most importantly, the [[main battery]] guns for {{ship|Spanish battleship|Jaime I||2}} did not arrive until 1919, after the war had ended.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez|Mitiukov|Crawford|2007|p=73}} The projected {{sclass-|Reina Victoria Eugenia|battleship|1}}s, which also would have relied heavily on imported guns and armour plate, were cancelled outright after the war started.{{sfn|Garzke|Dulin|1985|p=438}}\n\nAlso significant were the social impacts of the war. Though Spain as a whole was neutral throughout the war, the conflict split the country into groups of 'Francophiles' and 'Germanophiles' who each sympathised with the opposing Entente and Central Powers, the rift being only deepened by the ongoing U-Boat campaign which continued to impact Spanish ships.{{sfn|Lowry|2009|p=4}} The Spanish public also became aware of the harsh realities of the war itself by contact with a migratory influx of approximately 10,000 Spanish workers who returned home from Belgium, France and Germany.{{sfn|Sanz|2018}}\n\nSpanish journalists also acted as war correspondents near the battlefront, keeping the public informed with regard to the conflict and conditions, with opposing viewpoints in these reports often also contributing to the varying sympathies of the country and the divide as a whole.{{sfn|Sanz|2018}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n==External Links==\n* Articles relating to [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/regions/Spain Spain] at the International Encyclopedia of the First World War.\n* Ponce, Javier: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/spain Spain] , in: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/home/ 1914-1918-online.

Opinion among the public was divided. The upper classes (the aristocracy and the rich bourgeoisie), the Catholic Church and the [[Spanish Army]] generally favoured the [[Central Powers]], usually identified with [[German Empire|Germany]]. Among political parties, the Germanophile tendency was represented among the reactionary [[Carlists]] and the conservative ''[[Mauristas]]'', followers of [[Antonio Maura]], who himself favoured closer ties with the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] because of Spain's [[Pact of Cartagena|1907 pact with Britain and France]], which was designed to head off German colonialism in north Africa. Pro-Allied sentiment, which was generally Francophile, was most common among the middle and professional classes and intellectuals. It was common among [[Catalan nationalists]], [[Radical Republican Party|Republicans]] and [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialists]]. A few [[Liberal Party (Spain, 1880)|Liberals]], including [[\u00c1lvaro de Figueroa]], leader of the opposition in the ''Cortes'', were also pro-Allied.{{sfn|Romero|1999|pp=32\u201334}}\n\nAs early as August 1914, some Spaniards were volunteering in the [[French Army]], mainly the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]]. In 1915, they founded their own magazine, ''Iberia'', to defend and propagate their cause. In February 1916, the ''Comit\u00e8 de Germanor'' (Committee of Brotherhood) was set up in Barcelona to recruit for the Legion. Over 2,000 Spaniards ultimately served in the Legion.{{sfn|Romero|1999|p=35}} King Alfonso XIII also tried to help in the war by creating the [[European War Office]].\n\nIn 1916, the Fernando Po Affair threatened the Spanish neutrality.{{sfn|Strachan|2003|pp=612}}{{sfn|Murphy|2014}}\n\n==Effects of war==\nThough it remained one of few neutral countries in mainland Europe, Spain was still affected by the conflict in a variety of ways. Spain had believed that by remaining neutral, the nation would potentially benefit by the end of the war and hoped to emerge with significantly-enhanced prestige and power in a postwar Europe.{{sfn|Lowry|2009|p=ii}} The conflict had some positive effects for the Spanish, particularly in its economy. The Spanish economy, which had previously begun to industrialise, benefited from increased exporting of goods to the belligerent nations, including products such as steel and foodstuffs.{{sfn|McEvoy|2003}} Moreover, Spain's gold reserves more than tripled over the course of the war, allowing the government to significantly reduce its debts.{{sfn|McEvoy|2003}}  \n\nHowever, Spain also experienced negative impacts resulting from the war. With regard to its economy, the Spanish nmaritime trade was significantly impacted by German U-Boat campaigns, with an estimated 100 lives and 66 ships lost to the submarines.{{sfn|Sanz|2018}} Though Spanish industry in the north and the east of the country, expanded as demand rose among the warring powers for Spanish goods, the inflow of capital produced inflation and imports dropped, exacerbating the poverty of the rural areas and the south. The growing poverty intensified internal migration to the industrial areas, and the railway system was unable to bear the increased demand. The shortage of basic commodities became known as the ''crisis de subsistencias''. In 1915, food riots erupted in some cities, and in December 1915, the government resigned, to be replaced by a Liberal government under Figueroa.{{sfn|Romero|1999|p=36}}\n\nIn July 1916, the two main trade unions, the socialist [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]] and the [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarchosyndicalist]] [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]], joined forces to put pressure on the Liberal government. In March 1917, they even threatened to start a [[general strike]]. Their example inspired military officers to form unions of their own, the ''juntas de defensa''. The officers' goal was to prevent the passage of the Bill of Military Reform tabled in the ''Cortes'' in 1916, that sought to professionalise the military by introducing intellectual and physical tests as prerequisites for promotions; the ultimate goal being a reduction in the size of the bloated officers corps. The ''juntas de defensa'' demanded promotions and pay increases based strictly on seniority.{{sfn|Romero|1999|p=37}}\n\nThe war also had a significant impact on the construction program of the [[Spanish Navy]]. The second and third {{sclass-|Espa\u00f1a|battleship}}s, built in Spain between 1910 and 1919, were delayed significantly because of material shortages from Britain.{{sfn|Fitzsimons|1979|p=856}} Most importantly, the [[main battery]] guns for {{ship|Spanish battleship|Jaime I||2}} did not arrive until 1919, after the war had ended.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez|Mitiukov|Crawford|2007|p=73}} The projected {{sclass-|Reina Victoria Eugenia|battleship|1}}s, which also would have relied heavily on imported guns and armour plate, were cancelled outright after the war started.{{sfn|Garzke|Dulin|1985|p=438}}\n\nAlso significant were the social impacts of the war. Though Spain as a whole was neutral throughout the war, the conflict split the country into groups of 'Francophiles' and 'Germanophiles' who each sympathised with the opposing Entente and Central Powers, the rift being only deepened by the ongoing U-Boat campaign which continued to impact Spanish ships.{{sfn|Lowry|2009|p=4}} The Spanish public also became aware of the harsh realities of the war itself by contact with a migratory influx of approximately 10,000 Spanish workers who returned home from Belgium, France and Germany.{{sfn|Sanz|2018}}\n\nSpanish journalists also acted as war correspondents near the battlefront, keeping the public informed with regard to the conflict and conditions, with opposing viewpoints in these reports often also contributing to the varying sympathies of the country and the divide as a whole.{{sfn|Sanz|2018}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n==External Links==\n* Articles relating to [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/regions/Spain Spain] at the International Encyclopedia of the First World War.\n* Ponce, Javier: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/spain Spain] , in: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/home/ 1914-1918-online.

Igala and Yoruba have important historical and cultural relationships. The languages of the two ethnic groups bear such a close resemblance that researchers such as Forde (1951) and Westermann and Bryan (1952) regarded Igala as a dialect of Yoruba.\n\nThe Yoruboid languages are assumed to have developed out of an undifferentiated Volta-Niger group by the 1st millennium BCE.\nThere are three major dialect areas: Northwest, Central, and Southeast.<ref>This widely followed classification is based on Adetugb\u1ecd's (1982) dialectological study \u2013 the classification originated in his 1967 PhD thesis ''The Yoruba Language in Western Nigeria: Its Major Dialect Areas'', {{ProQuest|288034744}}.

This was exemplified by the following remark by Adetugb\u1ecd (1967), as cited in Fagborun (1994): \"While the orthography agreed upon by the missionaries represented to a very large degree the phonemes of the Ab\u1eb9okuta dialect, the morpho-syntax reflected the \u1eccy\u1ecd-Ibadan dialects\".\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Yoruba people}}\n{{See|Ife}}\n{{See also|Yoruba religion}}\n[[File:HistoYoruba.jpeg|left|thumb|Some Yoruba cities of the [[Middle Ages]]]]\n\nAs of the [[7th century BC|7th century BCE]] the African peoples who lived in [[Yorubaland]] were not initially known as the Yoruba, although they shared a common ethnicity and language group.

They are embodied in Ifa divination, and are known as the tripartite Book of Enlightenment in Yorubaland and in its diaspora.\n\nYoruba cultural thought is a witness of two epochs. The first epoch is a history of cosmogony and cosmology. This is also an epoch-making history in the oral culture during which time Oduduwa was the king, the Bringer of Light, pioneer of Yoruba folk philosophy, and a prominent diviner. He pondered the visible and invisible worlds, reminiscing about cosmogony, cosmology, and the mythological creatures in the visible and invisible worlds. His time favored the artist-philosophers who produced magnificent naturalistic artworks of civilization during the pre-dynastic period in Yorubaland.The second epoch is the epoch of metaphysical discourse, and the birth of modern artist-philosophy. This commenced in the 19th century in terms of the academic prowess of Bishop [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther]] (1807\u20131891). Although religion is often first in Yoruba culture, nonetheless, it is the philosophy \u2013 the thought of man \u2013 that actually leads spiritual consciousness (ori) to the creation and the practice of religion. Thus, it is believed that thought (philosophy) is an antecedent to religion. Values such as respect, peaceful co-existence, loyalty and freedom of speech are both upheld and highly valued in Yoruba culture. Societies that are considered secret societies often strictly guard and encourage the observance of moral values.\nToday, the academic and nonacademic communities are becoming more interested in Yoruba culture.

Many Yorubas adhere to Sunni Islam while some follow various [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations, while many others are Shia Muslims too, and some are practitioners of the traditional Yoruba religion. Yoruba religious practices such as the [[Eyo festival|Eyo]] and [[Osun-Osogbo]] festivals are witnessing a resurgence in popularity in contemporary Yorubaland. They are largely seen by the adherents of the modern faiths as cultural, rather than religious, events. They participate in them as a means to celebrate their people's history, and boost tourism in their local economies.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n=====Christianity=====\n[[File:Anna hinderer church and mission house at ibadan pic2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anna Hinderer]] church and mission house at [[Ibadan]], 1850s]]\n\nThe Yorubas were one of the first groups in West Africa to be introduced to Christianity on a large scale.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DdFvbW5tWpYC&pg=PA77&dq=christianity+in+yorubaland#v=onepage&q=christianity%20in%20yorubaland&f=false|title=Pre-Colonial Africa in Colonial African Narratives: From Ethiopia Unbound to Things Fall Apart, 1911\u20131958|author=Dr Donald R Wehrs|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=2013\n|isbn=978-1-4094-7495-1}}</ref>\nChristianity (along with western civilization) came into Yorubaland in the mid-19th century through the [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], whose original mission was commerce.<ref name = integration/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OdbBBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT74&dq=|title=Scientific Pilgrimage: 'The Life and times of Emeritus Professor V.A Oyenuga'.

As time progressed, other Europeans - such as the French, the British, and the Germans, followed suit. British and French people were the most successful in their quest for colonies (These Europeans actually split Yorubaland, with the larger part being in British Nigeria, and the minor parts in French Dahomey, now [[Benin]], and German [[Togoland]]). Home governments encouraged religious organizations to come. Roman Catholics (known to the Yorubas as Ijo Aguda, so named after returning former Yoruba slaves from Latin America, who were mostly Catholic, and were also known as the Agudas, [[Saro (Nigeria)|Saros]] or Amaros) started the race, followed by Protestants, whose prominent member \u2013 [[Church Mission Society]] (CMS) based in [[England]] made the most significant in-roads into the hinterland regions for evangelism and became the largest of the Christian missions. [[Methodism|Methodists]] (known as Ijo-Eleto, so named after the Yoruba word for \"method or process\") started missions in [[Badagry|Agbadarigi / Gbegle]] by [[Thomas Birch Freeman]] in 1842.

The increased tempo of Christianity led to the appointment of [[Saro (Nigeria)|Saros]] and indigenes as missionaries. This move was initiated by Venn, the CMS Secretary. Nevertheless, the impact of Christianity in Yorubaland was not felt until the fourth decade of the 19th century, when a Yoruba slave boy, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, became a Christian convert, linguist and minister whose knowledge in languages would become a major tool and instrument to propagate Christianity in Yorubaland and beyond.<ref>{{cite web|website=Yorupedia|url=http://yorupedia.com/subjects/yoruba-religion/christianity-and-islam/|title=Christianity and Islam Introduction|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>\nToday, there are a number of Yoruba Pastors and Church founders with large congregations, e.g. Pastor [[Enoch Adeboye]] of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor [[David Oyedepo]] of Living Faith Church World Wide also known as Winners Chapel, Pastor [[Tunde Bakare]] of Latter Rain Assembly, Prophet [[T.

The adherents of the Islamic faith are called Musulumi in Yoruba to correspond to Muslim, the Arabic word for an adherent of Islam having as the active participle of the same verb form, and means \"submitter (to Allah)\" or a nominal and active participle of Islam derivative of \"Salaam\" i.e. (Religion of) Peace. Islam was practiced in Yorubaland so early on in history, that a sizable proportion of Yoruba slaves taken to the Americas were already Muslim.<ref>{{cite book | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=NQwcAlYxP7sC&pg=PA157&dq=|title =Unfree Labour in the Development of the Atlantic World|author1=Paul E.

On a Sunday during Ramadan in January 1835, in the city of [[Salvador, Bahia]], a small group of slaves and freedmen, inspired by Muslim teachers, rose up against the government. Muslims were called Mal\u00ea in Bahia at this time, from Yoruba Imale that designated a Yoruba Muslim.\nThe Mosque served the spiritual needs of Muslims living in \u1eccy\u1ecd. Progressively, Islam started to gain a foothold in Yorubaland, and Muslims started building Mosques: [[Iwo, Osun|Iwo]] led, its first Mosque built in 1655 {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, followed by [[Iseyin|I\u1e63\u1eb9yin]] in 1760 {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, [[Lagos|Eko/Lagos]] got its first mosque in 1774 {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, [[Shaki, Nigeria|Shaki]], 1790 {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, and [[Osogbo|O\u1e63ogbo]], 1889. In time, Islam spread to other towns like [[Oyo, Nigeria|Oyo]] (the first Oyo convert was Solagberu), [[Ibadan]], [[Ab\u1eb9okuta]], [[Ijebu Ode]], [[Ikirun]], and [[Ede, Nigeria|Ede]]. All of these cities already had sizable Muslim communities before the 19th century Sokoto jihad.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Several factors contributed to the rise of Islam in Yorubaland by the middle of the 19th century. Before the decline of \u1eccy\u1ecd, several towns around it had large Muslim communities, however, when \u1eccy\u1ecd was destroyed, these Muslims (Yorubas and immigrants) relocated to newly formed towns and villages and became Islam evangelists.\n\nSecondly, there was a mass movement of people at this time into Yorubaland, many of these immigrants were Muslims who introduced Islam to their hosts. According to Eades, the religion \"differed in attraction\" and \"better adapted to Yoruba social structure, because it permitted polygamy\", which was already a feature of various African societies; more influential Yorubas (like Seriki Kuku of Ijebuland) soon became Muslims, with a positive impact on the natives. Islam came to Lagos at about the same time as other Yoruba towns, however, it received royal support from \u1eccba Kos\u1ecdk\u1ecd, after he came back from exile in [[Epe, Nigeria|\u1eb8p\u1eb9]]. Islam, like Christianity, also found common ground with the natives who already believed in a Supreme Being [[Olodumare]] / [[Olorun]]. Without delay, Islamic scholars and local Imams started establishing Koranic centers to teach Arabic and Islamic studies, much later, conventional schools were established to educate new converts and to propagate Islam.\nToday, the Yorubas constitute the second largest Muslim group in Nigeria, after the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] people of the Northern provinces. They are mostly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]], with small [[Ahmadiyya]] communities.\n\n===Traditional art and architecture===\n{{Main|Yoruba art}}\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum L54.5 Fragment of a Head (3).jpg|thumb|left|[[Terracotta]] head representing ''oni'' or King of [[Ife]], 12th to 16th century]]\n\nMedieval Yoruba settlements were surrounded with massive mud [[city wall|walls]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pMjHpEyDqJMC&pg=PA168&dq=Yoruba+adobe+mud+houses#v=onepage&q=Yoruba%20adobe%20mud%20houses&f=false|title=Traditional Buildings: A Global Survey of Structural Forms and Cultural Functions Volume 11 of International Library of Human Geography|author=Allen G.

A unique feature of Yoruba art is its striking realism that, unlike most African art, chose to create human sculptures in vividly realistic and life sized forms. The art history of the nearby [[Benin empire]] shows that there was a cross \u2013 fertilization of ideas between the neighboring Yoruba and Edo.

Yemoja could not have children and consulted an Ifa oracle, and the priest advised her to offer sacrifices and to dance with wooden images on her head and metal anklets on her feet. After performing this ritual, she became pregnant. Her first child was a boy, nicknamed \"Efe\" (the humorist/joker); the Efe mask emphasizes song and jests because of the personality of its namesake. Yemoja's second child was a girl, nicknamed \"Gelede\" because she was obese like her mother. Also like her mother, Gelede loved dancing.\n\nAfter getting married themselves, neither Gelede or Efe's partner could have children. The Ifa oracle suggested they try the same ritual that had worked for their mother. No sooner than Efe and Gelede performed these rituals \u2013 dancing with wooden images on their heads and metal anklets on their feet \u2013 they started having children. These rituals developed into the Gelede masked dance and were perpetuated by the descendants of Efe and Gelede. This narrative is one of many stories that explains the origin of Gelede.

She is also accompanied by a committee of priestesses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mynewswatchtimesng.com/behold-new-arugba-osun-wants-doctor/|work=Newswatch Times|title=Behold, new Arugba Osun, who wants to be doctor|date= 31 August 2013|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201408221221.html|title=Nigeria: Osun Osogbo 2014 \u2013 Arugba's Berth Tastes Green With Goldberg Touch|author=Gregory Austin Nwakunor|date=22 August 2014|publisher=AllAfrica|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref> A similar event holds in the New World as [[Odunde Festival]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6p2aLo2kafMC&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=Odunde+Festival+Yoruba+United+States+America#v=onepage&q=Odunde%20Festival%20Yoruba%20United%20States%20America&f=false|title=The United States and West Africa: Interactions and Relations Volume 34 of Rochester studies in African history and the diaspora|issn=1092-5228|author1=Alusine Jalloh|author2=Toyin Falola|publisher=University Rochester Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1-58046-308-9|page=32}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mK147fnLIrAC&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=Odunde+Festival+Yoruba+United+States+America#v=onepage&q=Odunde%20Festival%20Yoruba%20United%20States%20America&f=false|title=Art in the Lives of Immigrant Communities in the United States Rutgers Series: The Public Life of the Arts|author1=Paul DiMaggio|author2=Patricia Fernandez-Kelly|author3=Gilberto C\u00e2rdenas|author4=Yen Espiritu|author5=Amaney Jamal|author6=Sunaina Maira|author7=Douglas Massey|author8=Cecilia Menjivar|author9=Clifford Murphy|author10=Terry Rey|author11=Susan Seifert|author12=Alex Stepick|author13=Mark Stern|author14=Domenic Vitiello|author15=Deborah Wong|page=44|publisher=Rutgers University Press, 2010|isbn=978-0-8135-5041-1|date=13 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EyoFigure.jpg|thumb|Eyo figure in [[Lagos]]]]\nAnother very popular festival with spiritual connotations is the [[Eyo festival|Eyo Olokun festival]] or ''Adamu Orisha'' play, celebrated by the people of [[Lagos]]. The Eyo festival is a dedication to the god of the Sea [[Olokun]], who is an Orisha, and whose name literally mean ''Owner of the Seas''.<ref name=mapping/> Generally, there is no customarily defined time for the staging of the Eyo Festival. This leads to a building anticipation as to what date would be decided upon. Once a date for its performance is selected and announced, the festival preparations begin. It encompasses a week-long series of activities, and culminates in a striking procession of thousands of men clothed in white and wearing a variety of coloured hats, called ''Aga''. The procession moves through Lagos Island ''Isale Eko'', which is the historical centre of the Lagos metropolis. On the streets, they move through various crucial locations and landmarks in the city, including the palace of the traditional ruler of Lagos, the Oba, known as the [[Iga Idunganran]]. The festival starts from dusk to dawn, and has been held on Saturdays (Oj\u00f3 \u00c0b\u00e1m\u00e9ta) from time immemorial. A full week before the festival (always a Sunday), the 'senior' Eyo group, the Adimu (identified by a black, broad-rimmed hat), goes public with a staff. When this happens, it means the event will take place on the following Saturday. Each of the four other 'important' groups \u2013 Laba (Red), Oniko (yellow), Ologede (Green) and Agere (Purple) \u2014 take their turns in that order from Monday to Thursday.\n\n[[File:Eyo Olokun.jpg|thumb|left|Eyo Olokun]]\nThe Eyo masquerade essentially admits tall people, which is why it is described as ''Agogoro Eyo'' (literally meaning the tall Eyo masquerade). In the manner of a spirit (An Orisha) visiting the earth on a purpose, the Eyo masquerade speaks in a ventriloquial voice, suggestive of its otherworldliness; and when greeted, it replies: ''Mo yo fun e, mo yo fun ara mi'', which in Yoruba means: ''I rejoice for you, and I rejoice for myself''. This response connotes the masquerades as rejoicing with the person greeting it for the witnessing of the day, and its own joy at taking the hallowed responsibility of cleansing. During the festival, Sandals and foot wear, as well as ''Suku'', a hairstyle that is popular among the Yorubas \u2013 one that has the hair converge at the middle, then shoot upward, before tipping downward \u2013 are prohibited. The festival has also taken a more touristic dimension in recent times, which like the Osun Osogbo festival, attracts visitors from all across Nigeria, as well as Yoruba diaspora populations. In fact, it is widely believed that the play is one of the manifestations of the customary African revelry that serves as the forerunner of the modern carnival in Brazil and other parts of the [[New World]], which may have been started by the Yoruba slaves transplanted in that part of the world due to the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spyghana.com/celebrating-eyo-festival-in-the-modern-way/|title=Celebrating Eyo the Modern Way|website=SpyGhana}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingdomsofnigeria.com/eyolagosagog.php|title=Royalty in the news: Lagos agog for Eyo Festival today.|website=Kingdoms of Nigeria|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutlagos.com/?p=654|title=Eyo Festival|website=About Lagos|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IKqOUfqt4cIC&pg=PA346&dq=Yoruba+festivals+America#v=onepage&q=Yoruba%20festivals%20America&f=false|page=346|title=Traditional Festivals, Vol. 2 [M \u2013 Z]|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-089-5|accessdate=10 June 2015|year=2005}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:Drummers of traditional Gbedu drum in Yoruba land of Nigeria.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Gbedu drummers]]\n{{See also|Yoruba music|Bat\u00e1 drum}}\n[[File:Bata drums.jpg|thumb|The [[Bat\u00e1 drum]] \u2013 from left: ''Ok\u00f3nkolo'', ''Iy\u00e1'', ''It\u00f3tele'']]\n\nThe music of the Yoruba people is perhaps best known for an extremely advanced [[drummer|drumming]] tradition,<ref>{{cite book|title=Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 Music in the Twentieth Century Identity, Agency, and Performance Practice|author=Bode Omojola|date=4 December 2012|publisher=University of Rochester Press|accessdate=28 February 2014|url=http://www.urpress.com/store/viewItem.asp?idProduct=14012|isbn=978-1-58046-409-3}}</ref> especially using the dundun<ref name=\"Turino pg. 43\">Turino, pgs. 181\u2013182; Bensignor, Fran\u00e7ois with Eric Audra, and Ronnie Graham, \"Afro-Funksters\" and \"From Hausa Music to Highlife\" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pgs. 432\u2013436 and pgs. 588\u2013600; Karolyi, pg. 43</ref> hourglass tension drums. \nThe representation of musical instruments on sculptural works from Ile-Ife, indicates, in general terms a substantial accord with oral traditions.

The [[Talking drum|D\u00f9nd\u00fan / G\u00e1ngan family]], is the class of hourglass shaped talking drums, which imitate the sound of Yoruba speech. This is possible because the Yoruba language is tonal in nature. It is the most common and is present in many Yoruba traditions, such as [[Apala]], [[J\u00f9j\u00fa music|J\u00f9j\u00fa]], [[Sekere]] and [[Afrobeat]]. The second is the [[Sakara drum|Sakara family]]. Typically, they played a ceremonial role in royal settings, weddings and [[Oriki|Or\u00edk\u00ec]] recitation; it is predominantly found in traditions such as [[Sakara music]], Were and [[Fuji music]]. The [[Gbedu|Gbedu family]] (literally, \"large drum\") is used by secret fraternities such as the [[Ogboni]] and royal courts. Historically, only the Oba might dance to the music of the drum. If anyone else used the drum they were arrested for sedition of royal authority. The Gb\u00e8du are conga shaped drums played while they sit on the ground. ''Akuba'' drums (a trio of smaller conga-like drums related to the gb\u00e8du) are typically used in afrobeat. The ''Ogido'' is a cousin of the gbedu. It is also shaped like a conga but with a wider array of sounds and a bigger body. It also has a much deeper sound than the conga. It is sometimes referred to as the \"bass drum\". Both hands play directly on the Ogido drum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lagbaja.com/drums/ogido.php|website=Lagbaja|title=Ogido|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nToday, the word ''Gbedu'' has also come to be used to describe forms of Nigerian Afrobeat and Hip Hop music. The fourth major family of Yoruba drums is the [[Bat\u00e1 drum|B\u00e0t\u00e1 family]], which are well-decorated double-faced drums, with various tones. They were historically played in sacred rituals. They are believed to have been introduced by [[Shango]], an Orisha, during his earthly incarnation as a warrior king.\n\nTraditional Yoruba drummers are known as ''\u00c0y\u00e1n''. The Yoruba believe that ''\u00c0y\u00e1ngal\u00fa'' was the first drummer. He is also believed to be the spirit or muse that inspires drummers during renditions. This is why some Yoruba family names contain the prefix 'Ayan-' such as Ayangbade, Ayantunde, Ayanwande.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/genre/Yoruba+Music/|title=Yoruba music|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref> Ensembles using the [[Talking drum|dundun]] play a type of music that is also called ''dundun''.<ref name=\"Turino pg. 43\"/> The [[Ashiko]] (Cone shaped drums), ''Igbin'', [[Gudugudu]] (Kettledrums in the D\u00f9nd\u00fan family), [[Agidigbo]] and B\u00e8mb\u00e9 are other drums of importance. The leader of a dundun ensemble is the ''oniyalu'' meaning; ' ''Owner of the mother drum'' ', who uses the drum to \"talk\" by imitating the [[tonality]] of Yoruba. Much of this music is spiritual in nature, and is often devoted to the [[Orisa]]s.\n\n[[File:Benin, yoruba, campanaccio per invocare gli spiriti o le divinit\u00e0,.JPG|thumb|150px|Traditional [[Agog\u00f4|Agogo]] metal gongs]]\nWithin each drum family there are different sizes and roles; the lead drum in each family is called ''\u00ccy\u00e1'' or ''\u00ccy\u00e1 \u00ccl\u00f9'', which means \"Mother drum\", while the supporting drums are termed ''Omele''. Yoruba drumming exemplifies West-African cross-rhythms and is considered to be one of the most advanced drumming traditions in the world. Generally, improvisation is restricted to master drummers. Some other instruments found in Yoruba music include, but are not limited to; The [[Goje|G\u00f2j\u00e9]] ([[violin]]), [[Shekere|Sh\u00e8k\u00e8r\u00e8]] (gourd rattle), [[Agidigbo]] (thumb piano that takes the shape of a plucked [[Lamellophone]]), ''Saworo'' (metal rattles for the arm and ankles, also used on the rim of the bata drum), ''F\u00e8r\u00e8'' ([[whistle]]s), ''Aro'' ([[Cymbal]])s, [[Agog\u00f4]] ([[Bell (instrument)|bell]]), different types of [[flute]]s include the ''Ekutu'', ''Okinkin'' & ''Igba.''\n[[File:TalkingDrum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[talking drum]]]]\n\n[[Oriki]] (or praise singing), a genre of sung poetry that contains a series of proverbial phrases, praising or characterizing the respective person is of [[Egba people|Egba]] and [[Ekiti people|Ekiti]] origin, is often considered the oldest Yoruba musical tradition. Yoruba music is typically [[Polyrhythm]]ic, which can be described as interlocking sets of rhythms that fit together somewhat like the pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. There is a basic timeline and each instrument plays a pattern in relation to that timeline. The resulting ensemble provides the typical sound of West African Yoruba drumming. Yoruba music is a component of the modern Nigerian popular music scene. Although traditional Yoruba music was not influenced by foreign music, the same cannot be said of modern-day Yoruba music, which has evolved and adapted itself through contact with foreign instruments, talent, and creativity.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Twins in Yoruba society===\n{{Main|Ibeji}}\n[[File:Yoruba Ibeji figures, representing twins Wellcome L0035694.jpg|thumb|Wooden ''Ere Ibeji'' figures representing twins.

Some of these are ''K\u00e8mb\u00e8'' (Three-Quarter baggy pants), ''Gb\u00e1anu'', ''S\u00f3\u00f3r\u00f3'' (Long slim / streamlined pants), ''K\u00e1amu'' & ''S\u00f2k\u00f2t\u00f2 Elemu''. A man's dressing is considered incomplete without a cap (''F\u00ecl\u00e0''). Some of these caps include, but are not limited to; ''Gobi'' (Cylindrical, which when worn may be compressed and shaped forward, sideways, or backward), ''Tinko'', ''Abet\u00ed-aj\u00e1'' (Crest-like shape that derives its name from its hanging flaps that resembles a dog's hanging ears. The flaps can be lowered to cover the ears in cold weather, otherwise, they are upwardly turned in normal weather), ''Alagbaa, Oribi, Bentigoo, Onide'', and ''Labankada'' (a bigger version of the Abet\u00ed-aj\u00e1, and is worn in such a way as to reveal the contrasting color of the cloth used as underlay for the flaps).\n\nWomen also have different types of dresses. The most commonly worn are ''\u00ccr\u00f3'' (wrapper) and ''B\u00f9b\u00e1'' (blouse-like loose top). Women also have matching ''G\u00e8l\u00e8'' (head gear) that must be put on whenever the \u00ccr\u00f3 and B\u00f9b\u00e1 is on. Just as the cap (F\u00ecl\u00e0) is important to men, women's dressing is considered incomplete without G\u00e8l\u00e8. It may be of plain cloth or costly as the women can afford. Apart from this, they also have ''\u00ecbor\u00f9n'' ([[Shawl]]) and ''\u00ccp\u00e8l\u00e9'' (which are long pieces of fabric that usually hang on the left shoulder and stretch from the hind of the body to the fore). At times, it is tied round their waists over the original one piece wrapper. Unlike men, women have two types of under wears (\u00c8w\u00f9 \u00c0w\u00f2t\u00e9l\u00e8), called; ''T\u00f2bi'' and ''Sinm\u00ed''. T\u00f2bi is like the modern day apron with strings and spaces in which women can keep their valuables. They tie the t\u00f2bi around the waists before putting on the \u00ccr\u00f3 (wrapper). Sinm\u00ed is like a sleeveless T-shirt that is worn under before wearing any other dress on the upper body.\n\n[[File:Benin, yoruba, braccialetti, anelli e altri monili.JPG|300px|thumb|left|Yoruba metal bracelets and jewellery of old.

These are used by both males and females, and are put on for bodily adornment. Chiefs, priests, kings or people of royal descent, especially use some of these beads as a signifier of rank. Some of these beads include ''Iyun, Lagidigba, \u00c0k\u00fan'' etc. An accessory especially popular among royalty and titled [[Babalawo|Babalawos / Babalorishas]] is the ''\u00ccr\u00f9k\u00e8r\u00e8'', which is an artistically processed animal tail, a type of [[Fly-whisk]]. The horsetail whiskers are symbols of authority and stateliness.

Hair is considered the ' ''Glory of the woman'' '. They usually take care of their hair in two major ways; They plait and they weave. There are many types of plaiting styles, and women readily pick any type they want. Some of these include ''k\u00f2l\u00e9s\u00e8, \u00ccp\u00e0k\u00f3-el\u00e9d\u00e8, S\u00f9k\u00fa, Koj\u00fas\u00f3ko, Al\u00e1gogo, Konkoso'', Etc. Traditionally, The Yoruba consider tribal marks ways of adding beauty to the face of individuals. This is apart from the fact that they show clearly from which part of Yorubaland an individual comes from, since different areas are associated with different marks. Different types of [[Yoruba tribal marks|tribal marks]] are made with local blades or knives on the cheeks. These are usually done at infancy, when children are not pain conscious.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2017}} Some of these tribal marks include ''P\u00e9l\u00e9, Ab\u00e0j\u00e0-\u00c8gb\u00e1, Ab\u00e0j\u00e0-\u00d2wu, Ab\u00e0j\u00e0-m\u00e9rin, K\u00e9k\u00e9, G\u00f2mb\u00f2, Ture, P\u00e9l\u00e9 If\u00e8, K\u00e9k\u00e9 \u00d2wu, P\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00ccj\u00e8b\u00fa'' etc. This practice is near extinct today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africa.uga.edu/Yoruba/unit_06/cultureunit.html|website=Africa UGA|title=Traditional Clothes: Clothing and Fashion|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Yoruba believe that development of a nation is akin to the development of a man or woman. Therefore, the personality of an individual has to be developed in order to fulfill his or her responsibilities.

They are embodied in Ifa divination, and are known as the tripartite Book of Enlightenment in Yorubaland and in its diaspora.\n\nYoruba cultural thought is a witness of two epochs. The first epoch is a history of cosmogony and cosmology. This is also an epoch-making history in the oral culture during which time Oduduwa was the king, the Bringer of Light, pioneer of Yoruba folk philosophy, and a prominent diviner. He pondered the visible and invisible worlds, reminiscing about cosmogony, cosmology, and the mythological creatures in the visible and invisible worlds. His time favored the artist-philosophers who produced magnificent naturalistic artworks of civilization during the pre-dynastic period in Yorubaland.The second epoch is the epoch of metaphysical discourse, and the birth of modern artist-philosophy. This commenced in the 19th century in terms of the academic prowess of Bishop [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther]] (1807\u20131891). Although religion is often first in Yoruba culture, nonetheless, it is the philosophy \u2013 the thought of man \u2013 that actually leads spiritual consciousness (ori) to the creation and the practice of religion. Thus, it is believed that thought (philosophy) is an antecedent to religion. Values such as respect, peaceful co-existence, loyalty and freedom of speech are both upheld and highly valued in Yoruba culture. Societies that are considered secret societies often strictly guard and encourage the observance of moral values.\nToday, the academic and nonacademic communities are becoming more interested in Yoruba culture. More research is being carried out on Yoruba cultural thought as more books are being written on the subject.\n\n====Islam and Christianity ====\nThe Yoruba are traditionally very religious people, and are today pluralistic in their religious convictions.<ref name = integration>{{cite book | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=nkbYlltTi4sC&pg=PA103&dq=|title=Religion and National Integration in Africa: Islam, Christianity, and Politics in the Sudan and Nigeria (Series in Islam and society in Africa)|author=John O.

As time progressed, other Europeans - such as the French, the British, and the Germans, followed suit. British and French people were the most successful in their quest for colonies (These Europeans actually split Yorubaland, with the larger part being in British Nigeria, and the minor parts in French Dahomey, now [[Benin]], and German [[Togoland]]). Home governments encouraged religious organizations to come. Roman Catholics (known to the Yorubas as Ijo Aguda, so named after returning former Yoruba slaves from Latin America, who were mostly Catholic, and were also known as the Agudas, [[Saro (Nigeria)|Saros]] or Amaros) started the race, followed by Protestants, whose prominent member \u2013 [[Church Mission Society]] (CMS) based in [[England]] made the most significant in-roads into the hinterland regions for evangelism and became the largest of the Christian missions.

The increased tempo of Christianity led to the appointment of [[Saro (Nigeria)|Saros]] and indigenes as missionaries. This move was initiated by Venn, the CMS Secretary. Nevertheless, the impact of Christianity in Yorubaland was not felt until the fourth decade of the 19th century, when a Yoruba slave boy, Samuel Ajayi Crowther, became a Christian convert, linguist and minister whose knowledge in languages would become a major tool and instrument to propagate Christianity in Yorubaland and beyond.<ref>{{cite web|website=Yorupedia|url=http://yorupedia.com/subjects/yoruba-religion/christianity-and-islam/|title=Christianity and Islam Introduction|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>\nToday, there are a number of Yoruba Pastors and Church founders with large congregations, e.g. Pastor [[Enoch Adeboye]] of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor [[David Oyedepo]] of Living Faith Church World Wide also known as Winners Chapel, Pastor [[Tunde Bakare]] of Latter Rain Assembly, Prophet [[T.

The adherents of the Islamic faith are called Musulumi in Yoruba to correspond to Muslim, the Arabic word for an adherent of Islam having as the active participle of the same verb form, and means \"submitter (to Allah)\" or a nominal and active participle of Islam derivative of \"Salaam\" i.e. (Religion of) Peace.

On a Sunday during Ramadan in January 1835, in the city of [[Salvador, Bahia]], a small group of slaves and freedmen, inspired by Muslim teachers, rose up against the government. Muslims were called Mal\u00ea in Bahia at this time, from Yoruba Imale that designated a Yoruba Muslim.\nThe Mosque served the spiritual needs of Muslims living in \u1eccy\u1ecd. Progressively, Islam started to gain a foothold in Yorubaland, and Muslims started building Mosques: [[Iwo, Osun|Iwo]] led, its first Mosque built in 1655 {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, followed by [[Iseyin|I\u1e63\u1eb9yin]] in 1760 {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, [[Lagos|Eko/Lagos]] got its first mosque in 1774 {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, [[Shaki, Nigeria|Shaki]], 1790 {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, and [[Osogbo|O\u1e63ogbo]], 1889. In time, Islam spread to other towns like [[Oyo, Nigeria|Oyo]] (the first Oyo convert was Solagberu), [[Ibadan]], [[Ab\u1eb9okuta]], [[Ijebu Ode]], [[Ikirun]], and [[Ede, Nigeria|Ede]]. All of these cities already had sizable Muslim communities before the 19th century Sokoto jihad.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Several factors contributed to the rise of Islam in Yorubaland by the middle of the 19th century. Before the decline of \u1eccy\u1ecd, several towns around it had large Muslim communities, however, when \u1eccy\u1ecd was destroyed, these Muslims (Yorubas and immigrants) relocated to newly formed towns and villages and became Islam evangelists.\n\nSecondly, there was a mass movement of people at this time into Yorubaland, many of these immigrants were Muslims who introduced Islam to their hosts. According to Eades, the religion \"differed in attraction\" and \"better adapted to Yoruba social structure, because it permitted polygamy\", which was already a feature of various African societies; more influential Yorubas (like Seriki Kuku of Ijebuland) soon became Muslims, with a positive impact on the natives. Islam came to Lagos at about the same time as other Yoruba towns, however, it received royal support from \u1eccba Kos\u1ecdk\u1ecd, after he came back from exile in [[Epe, Nigeria|\u1eb8p\u1eb9]]. Islam, like Christianity, also found common ground with the natives who already believed in a Supreme Being [[Olodumare]] / [[Olorun]]. Without delay, Islamic scholars and local Imams started establishing Koranic centers to teach Arabic and Islamic studies, much later, conventional schools were established to educate new converts and to propagate Islam.\nToday, the Yorubas constitute the second largest Muslim group in Nigeria, after the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] people of the Northern provinces. They are mostly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]], with small [[Ahmadiyya]] communities.\n\n===Traditional art and architecture===\n{{Main|Yoruba art}}\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum L54.5 Fragment of a Head (3).jpg|thumb|left|[[Terracotta]] head representing ''oni'' or King of [[Ife]], 12th to 16th century]]\n\nMedieval Yoruba settlements were surrounded with massive mud [[city wall|walls]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pMjHpEyDqJMC&pg=PA168&dq=Yoruba+adobe+mud+houses#v=onepage&q=Yoruba%20adobe%20mud%20houses&f=false|title=Traditional Buildings: A Global Survey of Structural Forms and Cultural Functions Volume 11 of International Library of Human Geography|author=Allen G.

Yemoja could not have children and consulted an Ifa oracle, and the priest advised her to offer sacrifices and to dance with wooden images on her head and metal anklets on her feet. After performing this ritual, she became pregnant. Her first child was a boy, nicknamed \"Efe\" (the humorist/joker); the Efe mask emphasizes song and jests because of the personality of its namesake. Yemoja's second child was a girl, nicknamed \"Gelede\" because she was obese like her mother. Also like her mother, Gelede loved dancing.\n\nAfter getting married themselves, neither Gelede or Efe's partner could have children. The Ifa oracle suggested they try the same ritual that had worked for their mother. No sooner than Efe and Gelede performed these rituals \u2013 dancing with wooden images on their heads and metal anklets on their feet \u2013 they started having children. These rituals developed into the Gelede masked dance and were perpetuated by the descendants of Efe and Gelede. This narrative is one of many stories that explains the origin of Gelede.

The festival attracts thousands of Osun worshippers from all over Yorubaland and the Yoruba diaspora in the Americas, spectators and tourists from all walks of life. The Osun-Osogbo Festival is a two-week-long programme. It starts with the traditional cleansing of the town called 'Iwopopo', which is then followed in three days by the lighting of the 500-year-old sixteen-point lamp called ''Ina Olojumerindinlogun'', which literally means ''The sixteen eyed fire''. The lighting of this sacred lamp heralds the beginning of the Osun festival. Then comes the 'Ibroriade', an assemblage of the crowns of the past ruler, the Ataoja of Osogbo, for blessings. This event is led by the sitting ''Ataoja'' of Osogbo and the Arugba Yeye Osun (who is usually a young virgin from the royal family dressed in white), who carries a sacred white calabash that contains propitiation materials meant for the goddess Osun.

The Eyo festival is a dedication to the god of the Sea [[Olokun]], who is an Orisha, and whose name literally mean ''Owner of the Seas''.<ref name=mapping/> Generally, there is no customarily defined time for the staging of the Eyo Festival. This leads to a building anticipation as to what date would be decided upon. Once a date for its performance is selected and announced, the festival preparations begin. It encompasses a week-long series of activities, and culminates in a striking procession of thousands of men clothed in white and wearing a variety of coloured hats, called ''Aga''. The procession moves through Lagos Island ''Isale Eko'', which is the historical centre of the Lagos metropolis. On the streets, they move through various crucial locations and landmarks in the city, including the palace of the traditional ruler of Lagos, the Oba, known as the [[Iga Idunganran]]. The festival starts from dusk to dawn, and has been held on Saturdays (Oj\u00f3 \u00c0b\u00e1m\u00e9ta) from time immemorial. A full week before the festival (always a Sunday), the 'senior' Eyo group, the Adimu (identified by a black, broad-rimmed hat), goes public with a staff. When this happens, it means the event will take place on the following Saturday. Each of the four other 'important' groups \u2013 Laba (Red), Oniko (yellow), Ologede (Green) and Agere (Purple) \u2014 take their turns in that order from Monday to Thursday.\n\n[[File:Eyo Olokun.jpg|thumb|left|Eyo Olokun]]\nThe Eyo masquerade essentially admits tall people, which is why it is described as ''Agogoro Eyo'' (literally meaning the tall Eyo masquerade). In the manner of a spirit (An Orisha) visiting the earth on a purpose, the Eyo masquerade speaks in a ventriloquial voice, suggestive of its otherworldliness; and when greeted, it replies: ''Mo yo fun e, mo yo fun ara mi'', which in Yoruba means: ''I rejoice for you, and I rejoice for myself''. This response connotes the masquerades as rejoicing with the person greeting it for the witnessing of the day, and its own joy at taking the hallowed responsibility of cleansing. During the festival, Sandals and foot wear, as well as ''Suku'', a hairstyle that is popular among the Yorubas \u2013 one that has the hair converge at the middle, then shoot upward, before tipping downward \u2013 are prohibited. The festival has also taken a more touristic dimension in recent times, which like the Osun Osogbo festival, attracts visitors from all across Nigeria, as well as Yoruba diaspora populations. In fact, it is widely believed that the play is one of the manifestations of the customary African revelry that serves as the forerunner of the modern carnival in Brazil and other parts of the [[New World]], which may have been started by the Yoruba slaves transplanted in that part of the world due to the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spyghana.com/celebrating-eyo-festival-in-the-modern-way/|title=Celebrating Eyo the Modern Way|website=SpyGhana}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingdomsofnigeria.com/eyolagosagog.php|title=Royalty in the news: Lagos agog for Eyo Festival today.|website=Kingdoms of Nigeria|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutlagos.com/?p=654|title=Eyo Festival|website=About Lagos|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IKqOUfqt4cIC&pg=PA346&dq=Yoruba+festivals+America#v=onepage&q=Yoruba%20festivals%20America&f=false|page=346|title=Traditional Festivals, Vol. 2 [M \u2013 Z]|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-089-5|accessdate=10 June 2015|year=2005}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:Drummers of traditional Gbedu drum in Yoruba land of Nigeria.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Gbedu drummers]]\n{{See also|Yoruba music|Bat\u00e1 drum}}\n[[File:Bata drums.jpg|thumb|The [[Bat\u00e1 drum]] \u2013 from left: ''Ok\u00f3nkolo'', ''Iy\u00e1'', ''It\u00f3tele'']]\n\nThe music of the Yoruba people is perhaps best known for an extremely advanced [[drummer|drumming]] tradition,<ref>{{cite book|title=Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 Music in the Twentieth Century Identity, Agency, and Performance Practice|author=Bode Omojola|date=4 December 2012|publisher=University of Rochester Press|accessdate=28 February 2014|url=http://www.urpress.com/store/viewItem.asp?idProduct=14012|isbn=978-1-58046-409-3}}</ref> especially using the dundun<ref name=\"Turino pg. 43\">Turino, pgs. 181\u2013182; Bensignor, Fran\u00e7ois with Eric Audra, and Ronnie Graham, \"Afro-Funksters\" and \"From Hausa Music to Highlife\" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pgs. 432\u2013436 and pgs. 588\u2013600; Karolyi, pg. 43</ref> hourglass tension drums. \nThe representation of musical instruments on sculptural works from Ile-Ife, indicates, in general terms a substantial accord with oral traditions.

The [[Talking drum|D\u00f9nd\u00fan / G\u00e1ngan family]], is the class of hourglass shaped talking drums, which imitate the sound of Yoruba speech. This is possible because the Yoruba language is tonal in nature. It is the most common and is present in many Yoruba traditions, such as [[Apala]], [[J\u00f9j\u00fa music|J\u00f9j\u00fa]], [[Sekere]] and [[Afrobeat]]. The second is the [[Sakara drum|Sakara family]]. Typically, they played a ceremonial role in royal settings, weddings and [[Oriki|Or\u00edk\u00ec]] recitation; it is predominantly found in traditions such as [[Sakara music]], Were and [[Fuji music]]. The [[Gbedu|Gbedu family]] (literally, \"large drum\") is used by secret fraternities such as the [[Ogboni]] and royal courts. Historically, only the Oba might dance to the music of the drum. If anyone else used the drum they were arrested for sedition of royal authority. The Gb\u00e8du are conga shaped drums played while they sit on the ground. ''Akuba'' drums (a trio of smaller conga-like drums related to the gb\u00e8du) are typically used in afrobeat. The ''Ogido'' is a cousin of the gbedu. It is also shaped like a conga but with a wider array of sounds and a bigger body. It also has a much deeper sound than the conga. It is sometimes referred to as the \"bass drum\". Both hands play directly on the Ogido drum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lagbaja.com/drums/ogido.php|website=Lagbaja|title=Ogido|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nToday, the word ''Gbedu'' has also come to be used to describe forms of Nigerian Afrobeat and Hip Hop music. The fourth major family of Yoruba drums is the [[Bat\u00e1 drum|B\u00e0t\u00e1 family]], which are well-decorated double-faced drums, with various tones. They were historically played in sacred rituals. They are believed to have been introduced by [[Shango]], an Orisha, during his earthly incarnation as a warrior king.\n\nTraditional Yoruba drummers are known as ''\u00c0y\u00e1n''. The Yoruba believe that ''\u00c0y\u00e1ngal\u00fa'' was the first drummer. He is also believed to be the spirit or muse that inspires drummers during renditions. This is why some Yoruba family names contain the prefix 'Ayan-' such as Ayangbade, Ayantunde, Ayanwande.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/genre/Yoruba+Music/|title=Yoruba music|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref> Ensembles using the [[Talking drum|dundun]] play a type of music that is also called ''dundun''.<ref name=\"Turino pg. 43\"/> The [[Ashiko]] (Cone shaped drums), ''Igbin'', [[Gudugudu]] (Kettledrums in the D\u00f9nd\u00fan family), [[Agidigbo]] and B\u00e8mb\u00e9 are other drums of importance. The leader of a dundun ensemble is the ''oniyalu'' meaning; ' ''Owner of the mother drum'' ', who uses the drum to \"talk\" by imitating the [[tonality]] of Yoruba. Much of this music is spiritual in nature, and is often devoted to the [[Orisa]]s.\n\n[[File:Benin, yoruba, campanaccio per invocare gli spiriti o le divinit\u00e0,.JPG|thumb|150px|Traditional [[Agog\u00f4|Agogo]] metal gongs]]\nWithin each drum family there are different sizes and roles; the lead drum in each family is called ''\u00ccy\u00e1'' or ''\u00ccy\u00e1 \u00ccl\u00f9'', which means \"Mother drum\", while the supporting drums are termed ''Omele''. Yoruba drumming exemplifies West-African cross-rhythms and is considered to be one of the most advanced drumming traditions in the world. Generally, improvisation is restricted to master drummers. Some other instruments found in Yoruba music include, but are not limited to; The [[Goje|G\u00f2j\u00e9]] ([[violin]]), [[Shekere|Sh\u00e8k\u00e8r\u00e8]] (gourd rattle), [[Agidigbo]] (thumb piano that takes the shape of a plucked [[Lamellophone]]), ''Saworo'' (metal rattles for the arm and ankles, also used on the rim of the bata drum), ''F\u00e8r\u00e8'' ([[whistle]]s), ''Aro'' ([[Cymbal]])s, [[Agog\u00f4]] ([[Bell (instrument)|bell]]), different types of [[flute]]s include the ''Ekutu'', ''Okinkin'' & ''Igba.''\n[[File:TalkingDrum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[talking drum]]]]\n\n[[Oriki]] (or praise singing), a genre of sung poetry that contains a series of proverbial phrases, praising or characterizing the respective person is of [[Egba people|Egba]] and [[Ekiti people|Ekiti]] origin, is often considered the oldest Yoruba musical tradition. Yoruba music is typically [[Polyrhythm]]ic, which can be described as interlocking sets of rhythms that fit together somewhat like the pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. There is a basic timeline and each instrument plays a pattern in relation to that timeline. The resulting ensemble provides the typical sound of West African Yoruba drumming. Yoruba music is a component of the modern Nigerian popular music scene. Although traditional Yoruba music was not influenced by foreign music, the same cannot be said of modern-day Yoruba music, which has evolved and adapted itself through contact with foreign instruments, talent, and creativity.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Twins in Yoruba society===\n{{Main|Ibeji}}\n[[File:Yoruba Ibeji figures, representing twins Wellcome L0035694.jpg|thumb|Wooden ''Ere Ibeji'' figures representing twins.

Some of these are ''K\u00e8mb\u00e8'' (Three-Quarter baggy pants), ''Gb\u00e1anu'', ''S\u00f3\u00f3r\u00f3'' (Long slim / streamlined pants), ''K\u00e1amu'' & ''S\u00f2k\u00f2t\u00f2 Elemu''. A man's dressing is considered incomplete without a cap (''F\u00ecl\u00e0''). Some of these caps include, but are not limited to; ''Gobi'' (Cylindrical, which when worn may be compressed and shaped forward, sideways, or backward), ''Tinko'', ''Abet\u00ed-aj\u00e1'' (Crest-like shape that derives its name from its hanging flaps that resembles a dog's hanging ears. The flaps can be lowered to cover the ears in cold weather, otherwise, they are upwardly turned in normal weather), ''Alagbaa, Oribi, Bentigoo, Onide'', and ''Labankada'' (a bigger version of the Abet\u00ed-aj\u00e1, and is worn in such a way as to reveal the contrasting color of the cloth used as underlay for the flaps).\n\nWomen also have different types of dresses. The most commonly worn are ''\u00ccr\u00f3'' (wrapper) and ''B\u00f9b\u00e1'' (blouse-like loose top). Women also have matching ''G\u00e8l\u00e8'' (head gear) that must be put on whenever the \u00ccr\u00f3 and B\u00f9b\u00e1 is on. Just as the cap (F\u00ecl\u00e0) is important to men, women's dressing is considered incomplete without G\u00e8l\u00e8. It may be of plain cloth or costly as the women can afford. Apart from this, they also have ''\u00ecbor\u00f9n'' ([[Shawl]]) and ''\u00ccp\u00e8l\u00e9'' (which are long pieces of fabric that usually hang on the left shoulder and stretch from the hind of the body to the fore). At times, it is tied round their waists over the original one piece wrapper. Unlike men, women have two types of under wears (\u00c8w\u00f9 \u00c0w\u00f2t\u00e9l\u00e8), called; ''T\u00f2bi'' and ''Sinm\u00ed''. T\u00f2bi is like the modern day apron with strings and spaces in which women can keep their valuables. They tie the t\u00f2bi around the waists before putting on the \u00ccr\u00f3 (wrapper). Sinm\u00ed is like a sleeveless T-shirt that is worn under before wearing any other dress on the upper body.\n\n[[File:Benin, yoruba, braccialetti, anelli e altri monili.JPG|300px|thumb|left|Yoruba metal bracelets and jewellery of old.

These are used by both males and females, and are put on for bodily adornment. Chiefs, priests, kings or people of royal descent, especially use some of these beads as a signifier of rank. Some of these beads include ''Iyun, Lagidigba, \u00c0k\u00fan'' etc. An accessory especially popular among royalty and titled [[Babalawo|Babalawos / Babalorishas]] is the ''\u00ccr\u00f9k\u00e8r\u00e8'', which is an artistically processed animal tail, a type of [[Fly-whisk]]. The horsetail whiskers are symbols of authority and stateliness.

Hair is considered the ' ''Glory of the woman'' '. They usually take care of their hair in two major ways; They plait and they weave. There are many types of plaiting styles, and women readily pick any type they want. Some of these include ''k\u00f2l\u00e9s\u00e8, \u00ccp\u00e0k\u00f3-el\u00e9d\u00e8, S\u00f9k\u00fa, Koj\u00fas\u00f3ko, Al\u00e1gogo, Konkoso'', Etc. Traditionally, The Yoruba consider tribal marks ways of adding beauty to the face of individuals. This is apart from the fact that they show clearly from which part of Yorubaland an individual comes from, since different areas are associated with different marks. Different types of [[Yoruba tribal marks|tribal marks]] are made with local blades or knives on the cheeks. These are usually done at infancy, when children are not pain conscious.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2017}} Some of these tribal marks include ''P\u00e9l\u00e9, Ab\u00e0j\u00e0-\u00c8gb\u00e1, Ab\u00e0j\u00e0-\u00d2wu, Ab\u00e0j\u00e0-m\u00e9rin, K\u00e9k\u00e9, G\u00f2mb\u00f2, Ture, P\u00e9l\u00e9 If\u00e8, K\u00e9k\u00e9 \u00d2wu, P\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00ccj\u00e8b\u00fa'' etc. This practice is near extinct today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africa.uga.edu/Yoruba/unit_06/cultureunit.html|website=Africa UGA|title=Traditional Clothes: Clothing and Fashion|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Yoruba believe that development of a nation is akin to the development of a man or woman. Therefore, the personality of an individual has to be developed in order to fulfill his or her responsibilities.

In ''Pump It Up Fiesta'', MAX, Doin and SHK (originally from ''O2Jam'') joined as new in-house musicians.\n\nAlso, from ''Pump It Up 1st Dance Floor'' and onward are the large number of licensed K-pop songs from popular South Korean artists. Starting with ''Pump It Up Premiere'' and onward, the international songs are included mostly from North America, Latin America, Mexico, Brazil, China, etc. In almost every version, BanYa were also responsible for nonstop remixes that mixes numerous K-pop and world music songs, especially original songs (examples are ''J Knows that Old Bong'', ''World Remix'', ''Turkey Virus'', ''K-pop Dance'', ''Chicago Club Mix'', etc.), but they are available in Remix Station (Special Zone in ''NX'') and/or WorldMax in ''NX2'' and ''NXA'' (Quest World in ''Fiesta''). Starting ''Exceed 2'', full songs are added only in separate stations.\n\nThe background animations, or BGAs, are contributed to almost every song in Pump It Up series to add multimedia along with the song played, but some are generic in-game BGAs for remixes and full songs (especially regular songs when the visualizers have insufficient time to release until the next update or arcade mix). Some of these BGA's differ from each other, meaning they are visualized by numerous artists, but most of them are uncredited for unknown reasons. In ''Pump It Up Fiesta EX'', it marks the first game since ''Pump It Up 3rd Dance Floor ''(BanYa's \"An Interesting View\")'' ''where the visualizers are credited. These artists or animators can have either worked with Andamiro in-house, or been commissioned from animation studios outside. Starting ''Pump It Up Zero'', the live music video for the licensed K-pop song (and world music beginning in ''Pump It Up Fiesta 2, ''not in home version'' Exceed S.E.'') is added (''Footprints'' by T.O, e.g.) when Andamiro purchased a video from the record companies and studios. They are also cut for a regular song.\n\n==Songlist==\n=== ''1st Dance Floor''<ref>\"[http://www.ph-online.net/mixappearancesdb2015.xls 1st Dance floor to Prime Mix Appearances Excel file by Valius1]\".

Title of the anime is \"Canon-D: Part of the Memories #1\".\n\nDuring the field trip to the ancient park, the mysterious blue-haired student, felt in her presence, sneaks off from her classmates to find her old friend, the blue canon eye. She visits the old ruins through the hidden passage and finds the eye-carved ancient rock. She attaches her blue gem on its pupil, and she remembers the past through her flashback:\n\n''She was an intruder on the floating island, and the guardians, the red canon eyes, were searching for her. But her companion, the blue canon eye in exposed cyborg skin helps her destroy the treacherous island kingdom. To pass from the secured storage chamber, he fired a long-ranged laser beam at the ceiling bars to entrap the guards under debris. He led her to the master control room in the hidden door, and disguises himself using black hologram. He tricked the red guards to the wrong direction. When the diversion was discovered, the girl successfully overloaded the control center and ran away. The blue canon eye followed her through the passageways upstairs and downstairs. Outside the porch, she immediately leaped over the bottomless skies from the edge of the castle without fear, but she was saved when the blue canon eye caught her on his top. He led her to the escape chamber though the elevator. He desperately put her to the escape pod while the timer was quickly running out, guarding off the red canon eyes who are cutting out the sealed entrance. As the blue canon eye tried to flee to the same pod, the red laser was triggered to gun down the girl, but the blue canon eye protected her from being shot, sacrificing himself, and he was disabled. The reaction tossed the blue eye gem at her. The time was up and the pod launched away to the skies, leaving the floating island collapsing toward the ground. She embraced the blue pupil gem in grief.''\n\n''While she was brought to the exile, chambers, rooms and passages were shattered into pieces, and the gravity was shifted. The disabled blue canon eye rolled into the broken floors from the ruins and stopped at the ground.''\n\nThe flashback fades away to the present. The girl is still watching over her beloved protector to pay respects. She is amazed as the blue gem which she had placed blinks with light. This shows that the blue canon eye is functional again. The story ends.\n|'''Present'''\n||''Canon-D Full Song Mix'' is the first full PIU Original song in the series.\n''Canon-D Full Song Mix'' is the hidden song in ''Pump It Up Exceed 2.''\n|-\n|}\n\n=== ''Zero'' ===\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+\n|-\n!

The wolf boy tries to infatuate her by offering a bouquet of yellow flowers and a fish, and gets stubbornly ignored. A horse carriage rushes in, and terrifies the cat girl in front. The wolf boy immediately rescues her by throwing himself to push her away before she could be hit-and-run. Happily, he has his sparkling eyes met with love, but he gets slapped by her ungratefully. The cat girl leaves him sitting at the barrels depressively alone. But she returns and shows him a golden flower field and three windmills. Much of his delight, the wolf boy and cat girl falls in love with each other. Both of them kiss before a theatre curtain closes.\n\nVisualized by Coffee Milk\n|'''Present'''\n||Version 1.40+ only\n''Windmill ''is the second fastest song in the series with constant BPM.\n\n''Windmill ''is the first non-PRO song in the series that uses 3/4 time signature.\n|-\n|1340\n||Follow Me\n\ud314\ub85c\uc6b0 \ubbf8\n||SHK\n||PIU Original; Chiptune\n||155\n||Japan cities, temple and Mt.

It is shown that the witch wishes to steal the pendant. \"who have the pendant will get unlimited power\" is the reason. The pendant is worn by a young girl protected by her father the king from four shadow beings summoned in their castle. The wizard casts a portal in order to allow the girl escape. Her separation from her royal family saddens her with tears, while the king sacrifices himself to save his daughter.\nShe lands on the snowfield far away from the kingdom, cold and alone. As she drifts to nowhere in fear, she is ambushed by four shadow demons. She is almost sliced by one of the beings' blade-morphed arm, and she runs away helplessly. The fourth demon suddenly appears in front of her and stabs her brutally.\n\nHowever, this triggers her pendant's powerful wrath due to utter pain. She floats on mid-air, covered in fiery aura until her dress is magically changed to warrior-type outfit and the mystical long sword appears on her hands.\n\nThe shadow beings respond by attacking her, and the girl performs self-defense using the sword, although she has no skill in swordplay. Sometimes she is hit from behind, but she aimlessly swings her sword, fortunately slashing the incoming enemies. As she stands in front of the four shadow demons, she remembers what her father had been protecting her with courage and valor. Inspired by the deceased king, she is filled with strength and determination.

Starting with ''Pump It Up Premiere'' and onward, the international songs are included mostly from North America, Latin America, Mexico, Brazil, China, etc. In almost every version, BanYa were also responsible for nonstop remixes that mixes numerous K-pop and world music songs, especially original songs (examples are ''J Knows that Old Bong'', ''World Remix'', ''Turkey Virus'', ''K-pop Dance'', ''Chicago Club Mix'', etc.), but they are available in Remix Station (Special Zone in ''NX'') and/or WorldMax in ''NX2'' and ''NXA'' (Quest World in ''Fiesta''). Starting ''Exceed 2'', full songs are added only in separate stations.\n\nThe background animations, or BGAs, are contributed to almost every song in Pump It Up series to add multimedia along with the song played, but some are generic in-game BGAs for remixes and full songs (especially regular songs when the visualizers have insufficient time to release until the next update or arcade mix). Some of these BGA's differ from each other, meaning they are visualized by numerous artists, but most of them are uncredited for unknown reasons. In ''Pump It Up Fiesta EX'', it marks the first game since ''Pump It Up 3rd Dance Floor ''(BanYa's \"An Interesting View\")'' ''where the visualizers are credited. These artists or animators can have either worked with Andamiro in-house, or been commissioned from animation studios outside. Starting ''Pump It Up Zero'', the live music video for the licensed K-pop song (and world music beginning in ''Pump It Up Fiesta 2, ''not in home version'' Exceed S.E.'') is added (''Footprints'' by T.O, e.g.) when Andamiro purchased a video from the record companies and studios. They are also cut for a regular song.\n\n==Songlist==\n=== ''1st Dance Floor''<ref>\"[http://www.ph-online.net/mixappearancesdb2015.xls 1st Dance floor to Prime Mix Appearances Excel file by Valius1]\".

While the superhuman stands behind the front entrance, they are ordered to shoot him down (reference to the plot of the film, \"[[The End of Evangelion]]\"). But he has an inevitable force shield (reference to A.T. Field), leaving him unharmed. The superhuman uses his speed-of-light jump, making one of the guards astonished in fear. He finishes the guards, and gives more space to gaze at a woman, and smiles slowly. The scene freezes at the end of the song before they start the combat.\nVisualized by Kim Young Bum\n|'''Present'''\n||''Cannon X.1'' is the remix of ''Canon D'' by BanYa from ''Pump It Up Exceed 2.''\n\n''Cannon X.1'' shares some similarities with [[JerryC]]'s Canon Rock, the cover version of \"[[Canon in D]]\".\n\n''Cannon X.1''<nowiki/>'s video is inspired from [[Hideaki Anno]]'s anime, ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]''.\n|-\n|F03\n||Chopsticks Challenge\n\uc813\uac00\ub77d \ubcc0\uc8fc\uace1\n||[[BanYa|Yahpp]]\n||PIU Original\nElectro House\n||128\n||Female dancer performs mambo dance in different shots.\nVisualized by Choi U Tum\n|'''Present'''\n||\n|-\n|F04\n||LaLaLa\n\ub77c \ub77c \ub77c\n||[[Big Bang (South Korean band)|Big Bang]]\n||K-Pop\nBig Beat\n||102\n||Visualized by Lu In Chui\n|''Pump It Up Fiesta 2''\n||\n|-\n|F05\n||Adios\n\uc544\ub514\uc624\uc2a4\n||[[Eun Ji-won|Eun Ji Won]]\n||K-Pop\nSoul\n||123\n||In the deep space similar to Star Wars, a female space ranger receives a distress call from her brother imprisoned in the enemy battleship.

The girl fires her plasma beam at the reptilian aliens, and the boy slashes them. As the girl finds the lair of alien menace on her computer, both irrupt the colony, and defeat second wave of aliens by surprise. They enter the lair of eggs and confront the 6-armed draconian queen, so they repeat their attack and the colony detonates.

The wolf boy tries to infatuate her by offering a bouquet of yellow flowers and a fish, and gets stubbornly ignored. A horse carriage rushes in, and terrifies the cat girl in front. The wolf boy immediately rescues her by throwing himself to push her away before she could be hit-and-run. Happily, he has his sparkling eyes met with love, but he gets slapped by her ungratefully. The cat girl leaves him sitting at the barrels depressively alone. But she returns and shows him a golden flower field and three windmills. Much of his delight, the wolf boy and cat girl falls in love with each other.

It is shown that the witch wishes to steal the pendant. \"who have the pendant will get unlimited power\" is the reason. The pendant is worn by a young girl protected by her father the king from four shadow beings summoned in their castle. The wizard casts a portal in order to allow the girl escape. Her separation from her royal family saddens her with tears, while the king sacrifices himself to save his daughter.\nShe lands on the snowfield far away from the kingdom, cold and alone. As she drifts to nowhere in fear, she is ambushed by four shadow demons. She is almost sliced by one of the beings' blade-morphed arm, and she runs away helplessly. The fourth demon suddenly appears in front of her and stabs her brutally.\n\nHowever, this triggers her pendant's powerful wrath due to utter pain. She floats on mid-air, covered in fiery aura until her dress is magically changed to warrior-type outfit and the mystical long sword appears on her hands.\n\nThe shadow beings respond by attacking her, and the girl performs self-defense using the sword, although she has no skill in swordplay. Sometimes she is hit from behind, but she aimlessly swings her sword, fortunately slashing the incoming enemies. As she stands in front of the four shadow demons, she remembers what her father had been protecting her with courage and valor. Inspired by the deceased king, she is filled with strength and determination. She finishes the foes off in one powerful slash.\n\nAfter the shadow beings disintegrate from their deaths, the girl returns to normal self, worn-out and tattered, while her sword is standing behind her in the middle of snowy land.\n\nVisualized by ADZUKI & L.Ferdinant\n|'''Present'''\n|Version 1.15.0+ only\n\n''Prime Japanese Edition'' version 1.11.0+ only\n\n''Red Snow's'' title is mistakenly written as \"Red Snom\" on its background.
