There was a flurry of telephone calls from various French authorities, culminating in a call at {{nowrap|9:45 p.m.}} from the Chief of the Air Staff, General [[Joseph Vuillemin]] to the headquarters of [[British Air Forces in France]] (BAAF, Air Marshal [[Arthur Barratt]]).{{sfn|Richards|1974|pp=146\u2013147}}\n\n[[File:102 Squadron Whitley at RAF Topcliffe WWII IWM CH 2052.jpg|thumb|A Whitley Mark V bomber of 102 Squadron.]]\nField followed the orders from the Air Ministry in Britain and Barratt in the evening. Around {{nowrap|0:30 a.m.}} as the first Wellington taxied into position for take-off, French troops blocked the runway with a line of lorries and carts; Field had no choice but to abort the mission and most of the Wellingtons returned to England the next day. On the evening of 11 June, the British diplomatic representatives in France heard that the French had stopped the British bombers from taking off from Salon and after strong protests [[Paul Reynaud]], the French prime minister, agreed to order the French authorities to co-operate.{{sfn|Woodward|1970|p=252}}\n\nFrom England, [[No. 4 Group RAF|4 Group]] sent {{nowrap|36 Whitleys}} from [[No. 10 Squadron RAF|10 Squadron]], [[No. 51 Squadron RAF|51 Squadron]], [[No. 58 Squadron RAF|58 Squadron]], [[No. 77 Squadron RAF|77 Squadron]] and [[No. 102 Squadron RAF|102 Squadron]]. The Whitleys refuelled at the advanced bases on [[Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]] and flew to Italy. Severe storms and icing caused the majority of the aircraft to turn back and only {{nowrap|13 reached}} their targets at Turin and Genoa; two aircraft failed to return.

Eight aircraft left on the evening of 15 June to bomb the Ansaldo works at Genoa.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=126}} Thunderstorms made navigation difficult; only one aircraft arrived over the target and the rest returned with their bombs.

He played at the collegiate level for [[Ohio State University]] and professionally for the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].  It was during his time at Ohio State that he was severely injured in one of the more brutal on-court brawls in basketball history.\n\n==High school and college==\nWitte was a standout player at [[Marlington High School (Alliance, Ohio)|Marlington High School]] in [[Alliance, Ohio]], where he scored over 1500 points during his career.\n\nHe went on to the [[Ohio State University]], where, as a sophomore, in [[1971 in sports|1971]] led the team in [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] (331 for the season) and was all-[[Big Ten]].  The Ohio State team were Big Ten champions, and teamed with fellow Buckeye standouts [[Allan Hornyak]] and [[Jim Cleamons]].  The 1971 Ohio State team defeated Marquette in the NCAA Tournament Mid-East regional semifinal before losing to Western Kentucky.\n\n==Brawl in Minnesota==\nWitte is best known for the incident at the Ohio State\u2013[[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|Minnesota]] game, played at [[Williams Arena|Minnesota]] on January 25, 1972.  According to the Big Ten Conference's review of the game film, Witte appeared to elbow Minnesota guard Bobby Nix as the two teams headed to their locker rooms at halftime.

While on the floor, he was also kicked and stomped by Minnesota player [[Ron Behagen]], knocking him unconscious. What followed was an extended brawl. Witte's white teammate, Dave Merchant, attempted to come to his aid, but was struck in the face several times by Gopher [[Jim Brewer (basketball)|Jim Brewer]], who was black. Another white Buckeye, Mark Wagar (currently the president of Empire BlueCross BlueShield in New York), was attacked from behind by black Minnesota player\u2014and future [[Major League Baseball]] [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]]\u2014[[Dave Winfield]], who landed a barrage of punches to Wagar's head.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/01/25/20070125-C1-02.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523060846/http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/01/25/20070125-C1-02.html |archivedate=2011-05-23 }}</ref>\n\nWhen order was restored, Minnesota Athletic Director [[Paul Giel]] announced the game was over and the Buckeyes were a 50-44 victor, prompting Minnesota fans to boo and throw objects as Witte was carried from the floor. Hospitalized for several days, including 24 hours in [[intensive care]], Witte's injuries included 29 facial stitches and a scarred [[cornea]].  In all, three Ohio State players were taken to hospitals.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe [[Big Ten Conference]] suspended Taylor and Behagen for the rest of the season.  Ohio State [[head coach]] [[Fred Taylor (basketball coach)|Fred Taylor]] was angered that the universities (including his own), the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], and the Big Ten Conference refused to pursue sanctions against the Minnesota program, and said later that his enthusiasm for the game was lost as a result; he retired early, in 1976.<ref>[http://nabc.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/010602aaa.html Fred Taylor obituary, National Association of Basketball Coaches page]</ref>  The Minnesota coach, [[Bill Musselman]], was blamed for fostering a thuggish Gopher atmosphere\u2014for instance, he had his team perform dunks and slams during pre-game workouts. Musselman denied that he ordered his team to play dirty or to initiate fights.  Despite losing two of its key players, Minnesota went on to win the Big Ten championship with an 11-3 record.\n\nFollowing the incident, the NCAA banned the practice of players performing dunks and slams during pre-game warm-ups when officials are not present. Witte chose not to pursue legal or any other avenue of retribution against his attackers. Instead, he has extended forgiveness and tried to achieve reconciliation.<ref>[http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/02/18/20070218-E5-00.html Forgiveness helps Witte heal after 1972 brawl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522232231/http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/02/18/20070218-E5-00.html |date=2011-05-22 }}</ref>\n\n==Pro career==\nWitte was selected in the fourth round of the [[1973 NBA Draft]] by the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], who also had fellow Buckeyes Hornyak and [[Jim Cleamons]]. Minnesota fight participant, [[Jim Brewer]] was on the team as well.  Witte saw part-time action over three seasons; his {{convert|250|lb|adj=on}} body spread over {{convert|7|ft|m}} was not mobile enough for an NBA then stocked with very good centers. He still suffered from vision impairment as well.\n\n==After basketball==\nFollowing his career in professional basketball, Luke Witte established his own sporting store in Alliance, Ohio which he operated for more than five years before becoming a minister.

Another Buckeye, Mark Wagar (currently the president of Empire BlueCross BlueShield in New York), was attacked from behind by Minnesota player\u2014and future [[Major League Baseball]] [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]]\u2014[[Dave Winfield]], who landed four or five punches to Wagar's head.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/01/25/20070125-C1-02.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523060846/http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/01/25/20070125-C1-02.html |archivedate=2011-05-23 }}</ref>\n\nWhen order was restored, Minnesota Athletic Director [[Paul Giel]] announced the game was over and the Buckeyes were a 50-44 victor, prompting Minnesota fans to boo and throw objects as Witte was carried from the floor. Hospitalized for several days, including 24 hours in [[intensive care]], Witte's injuries included 29 facial stitches and a scarred [[cornea]].  In all, three Ohio State players were taken to hospitals.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe [[Big Ten Conference]] suspended Taylor and Behagen for the rest of the season.  Ohio State [[head coach]] [[Fred Taylor (basketball coach)|Fred Taylor]] was angered that the universities (including his own), the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], and the Big Ten Conference refused to pursue sanctions against the Minnesota program, and said later that his enthusiasm for the game was lost as a result; he retired early, in 1976.<ref>[http://nabc.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/010602aaa.html Fred Taylor obituary, National Association of Basketball Coaches page]</ref>  The Minnesota coach, [[Bill Musselman]], was blamed for fostering a thuggish Gopher atmosphere\u2014for instance, he had his team perform dunks and slams during pre-game workouts. Musselman denied that he ordered his team to play dirty or to initiate fights.  Despite losing two of its key players, Minnesota went on to win the Big Ten championship with an 11-3 record.\n\nFollowing the incident, the NCAA banned the practice of players performing dunks and slams during pre-game warm-ups when officials are not present. Witte chose not to pursue legal or any other avenue of retribution against his attackers. Instead, he has extended forgiveness and tried to achieve reconciliation.<ref>[http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/02/18/20070218-E5-00.html Forgiveness helps Witte heal after 1972 brawl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522232231/http://www.dispatch.com/live/contentbe/dispatch/2007/02/18/20070218-E5-00.html |date=2011-05-22 }}</ref>\n\n==Pro career==\nWitte was selected in the fourth round of the [[1973 NBA Draft]] by the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], who also had fellow Buckeyes Hornyak and [[Jim Cleamons]].

Colonial Americans drank a variety of distilled spirits. As the supply of distilled spirits, especially rum, increased and the price dropped, they became the drink of choice throughout the colonies.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Salinger, S. V. (n.d.). Taverns and Drinking in Early America. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press.</ref> In 1770, per capita consumption was 3.7 gallons of [[distilled spirits]] per year, rising to 5.2 gallons in 1830 or approximately 1.8 one-ounce [[Shooter (mixed drink)|shots]] a day for every adult white man.<ref>{{cite book|author=W.

[[Benjamin Franklin]] printed a \"''Drinker's Dictionary''\" in his ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' in 1737, listing some 228 [[slang]] terms used for [[drunkenness]] in [[Philadelphia]].\n\nThe sheer volume of [[hard liquor]] consumption fell off, but the brewing of beer increased and men developed [[customs]] and [[traditions]] based on how to behave at the tavern. By 1900, the 26 million American men over age 18 [[patron]]ized 215,000 [[licensed]] taverns and probably 50,000 unlicensed (illegal) ones, or one per hundred men.<ref>Kingsdale (1973) pp. 472\u20133. Nationwide, about half the men in 1900 belonged to [[pietistic]] [[Protestant churches]] (such as [[Methodists]] and [[Baptists]]) that severely frowned on drinking in those days.</ref>  Twice the density could be found in working class [[neighborhoods]]. They served mostly beer; bottles were available but most drinkers went to the taverns. Probably half the American men avoided [[Bar (establishment)|saloons]], so the average consumption for actual patrons was about a half-[[gallon]] of beer per day, six days a week. In 1900, the city of [[Boston]] (with about 200,000 adult men) counted 227,000 daily saloon customers.<ref>Kingsdale (1973) pp. 472\u20133.</ref>\n\n==Colonial America to 1800==\nTaverns in the colonies closely followed the ''ordinaries'' of the [[mother country]]. Taverns, along with inns, at first were mostly known as ''ordinaries'', which were constructed throughout most of New England.<ref name=\"Penguin\">{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Iain|title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol|date=2008|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-1-592-40464-3|page=127|edition=1st}}</ref> These institutions were influential in the development of new settlements, serving as gathering spaces for the community. Taverns here though served many purposes such as courtrooms, religious meetings, trading posts, inns, post offices, and convenience stores.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steven|first=Struzinski|year=2002|title=The Tavern in Colonial America|url=http://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&context=ghj|journal=The Gettysburg Historical Journal|volume=1|issue=1|pages=|issn=2327-3917|via=}}</ref>  The taverns in the north and south were different in their uses as well unlike the central ideal tavern in England. The ones in the South that are closer to the frontier were used as inns and trading post from those who were headed into the unknown lands to settle.<ref name=\"thorp\"/> The multiple functions of public houses were especially important in frontier communities where other institutions were often weak, and this was certainly true on the southern colonial frontier.<ref name=\"thorp\"/> They were supervised by [[county]] officials who recognized the need for taverns and the need to maintain order, to minimize drunkenness and avoid it if possible on Sundays, as well as to establish the responsibilities of [[tavern keepers]]. With these profits came progress, improving their new homeland with the use of taverns as well as breweries.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Iain|title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol|date=2008|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-1-592-40464-3|page=126|edition=1st}}</ref> The original structure of these taverns were log cabins, typically a storey and a half high with two rooms on each floor. The ground floor was the floor the public could use where the upper-level floor was the bedrooms and somewhat removed from the public.\n\n===Earliest hotels===\nLarger taverns provided rooms for travelers, especially in county seats that housed the county court. Upscale taverns had a lounge with a huge fireplace, a bar at one side, plenty of benches and chairs, and several dining tables. The best houses had a separate parlor for ladies because the other part was unclean, an affable landlord, good cooking, soft, roomy beds, fires in all rooms in cold weather, and warming pans used on the beds at night. In the backwoods, the taverns were wretched hovels, dirty with vermin for company; even so they were more pleasant and safer for the stranger than camping by the roadside. Even on main highways such as the Boston Post Road, travelers routinely reported the taverns had bad food, hard beds, scanty blankets, inadequate heat, and poor service. One Sunday in 1789 President [[George Washington]], touring Connecticut, discovered that the locals discouraged travel on the Sabbath, so he spent the day at Perkins Tavern, \"which by the way is not a good one\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank E.

Colonists learned current crop prices, engaged in trade, and heard newspapers read aloud. For most rural Americans the tavern was the chief link to the greater world, playing a role much like the city marketplace of medieval Europe.\n\nTaverns absorbed leisure hours and games were provided. Horse races often began and ended at taverns, as did militia-training exercises. Cockfights were common. At upscale taverns the gentry had private rooms or even organized a club. When politics was in season, or the county court was meeting, political talk filled the taverns.\n\nTaverns served multiple functions on the Southern colonial frontier.  Society in Rowan County, North Carolina, was divided along lines of ethnicity, gender, race, and class, but in taverns the boundaries often overlapped, as diverse groups were brought together at nearby tables. Consumerism in the backcountry was limited not by ideology or culture but by distance from markets and poor transportation. The increasing variety of drinks served and the development of clubs indicates that genteel culture spread rapidly from London to the periphery of the English world.<ref name=\"thorp\">{{cite journal|jstor=2211137|author=Daniel B.

Local magistrates\u2014who had to award a license before a tavern could operate\u2014preferred widows who knew the business and might otherwise be impoverished and become a charge to the county.<ref>Tavern licenses were assigned to men, but both magistrates and license applicants knew that the tavern itself would be run by the petitioner's wife or daughter.</ref> Mainly, because taverns started to become upper-class establishments, calling for more experienced proprietors.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Only licensed ordinaries, though, would usually be able to sell alcohol for consumption with fixed measures for fixed prices.<ref name=\"Penguin\"/> Women and children were not usually welcome as fellow drinkers. In some instances women and children were welcome in taverns but it was mostly a place reserved for men. If women were found in a tavern they were typically considered prostitutes. Women would come into taverns to look for their husbands, or they would come with their fathers or brothers; other than that women were not allowed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Salinger|first1=Sharon|title=Taverns and Drinking in Early America}}</ref> The drinkers were men\u2014and indeed often defined their manliness by how much alcohol they could drink at a time.  The public held standards like keeping an orderly house, selling at prices that were the same as what the law said, and not slandering other tavern keepers, resulting in bad reputations.<ref name=\"thorp\"/>\n\n==Meeting place and community center==\nIn rural communities the tavern was a very important public space. The tavern offered the community not only a place to meet, but also a place to conduct business. The tavern also acted as an improptu court house where rules could be made and disputes could be settled.<ref name=\"thorp\"/> From 1660 to 1665 the Virginia government met in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] at the local taverns. From 1749 to 1779, the [[Mosby Tavern]] was the [[courthouse]], [[jail]], and [[Militia (United States)|militia]] [[wikt:rendezvous|rendezvous]] for [[Cumberland County, Virginia]] and later for [[Powhatan County, Virginia]]. [[Gifford Dalley]] managed [[City Tavern]] in Philadelphia, which served as an unofficial meeting place for the [[First Continental Congress]] and in documents he served as the Keeper of the Door for the First, Second and Third United States Congresses. Daily's brother-in-law [[Samuel Fraunces]] owned [[Fraunces Tavern]] in [[New York City]] where Congress met while City Hall was under construction. The last time Congress met at a tavern it was at Fraunces Tavern. The [[Tun Tavern]] in [[Philadelphia]] is regarded as the place where the [[U.S. Marines]] were first recruited. Neither place still exists. A reconstruction of [[City Tavern]] in Philadelphia is still in operation.\n\n==Mail stop and post office==\nMany were also the local post office and or the polling place. The [[United States Postal Service]] had its origins in the private taverns and [[coffeehouse]]s of America.<ref name=\"NPM Bib\">{{cite web|title=The Postal Service in Colonial America: A Bibliography of Material in the Smithsonian Institution Libraries National Postal Museum Branch | url=http://www.sil.si.edu/SILPublications/postal-history/bibliography/ | work=National Postal Museum|publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}</ref>\n\nA depiction of Civil War troops reading their mail at the Eagle Tavern which doubled as the post office in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] can be seen at the Silver Spring Library. The Old Post Office Tavern is in operation today in Leavenworth, Washington. Old Kelley's Tavern in New Hampshire is a multifunctional tavern. Colonel William B. Kelley of New Hampshire operated a tavern and was the Postmaster General for New Hampshire. The mail came and went from his home. The Hanover Tavern in [[Hanover County, Virginia]] is another tavern which also operated as the post office. The [[General Wayne Inn]] in Lower Merion Pennsylvania also served as a post office from 1830 to 1850 and was also the [[polling place]] in 1806.\n\n==Oldest taverns==\n[[File:White Horse Tavern Newport.JPG|thumb|right|The historic White Horse Tavern in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], in the [[United States]]]]\n[[File:Wayside Inn1.jpg|thumb|right|The Wayside Inn in Sudbury, Massachusetts]]\n[[File:Barroom Dancing by John Lewis Krimmel.jpg|thumb|''Barroom Dancing'', c. 1820, by [[John Lewis Krimmel]]]]\nThe oldest tavern is a distinction claimed by numerous establishments. Some establishments clarify their claims with oldest continuously operating tavern, oldest family-owned tavern, oldest drinking establishment, or oldest licensed; there are many ways to distinguish the oldest tavern. The first tavern in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] was a [[Puritan]] [[public house|ordinary]], opened on March 4, 1633.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hosmer|first=James Kendall (editor)|title=Winthrop's Journal \"History of New England\" 1630-1649|place=New York|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=1908|url=https://archive.org/details/winthropsjourna06hosmgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/winthropsjourna06hosmgoog/page/n142 120]|quote=Winthrop reported that Samuel Cole set up the first house for common entertainment....|ref=harv}}</ref>  That date would have been given under the [[Julian Calendar]], which was in use by England and its colonies at the time.\n\nThe [[White Horse Tavern (Newport, Rhode Island)|White Horse Tavern]], in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], is most likely the Tavern housed in the oldest building {built 1683; licensed 1687}. The Blue Anchor, the first drinking establishment at Front and Dock Streets in [[Philadelphia]], began operation in 1681. [[Jean Lafitte]]'s [[Black Smith Shoppe]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] some claim to be the oldest bar continuously operating before 1775.  Lafitte himself was born in 1776. The [[Wayside Inn]] in Sudbury, Massachusetts, is reputedly the oldest operating inn in America, going back to 1716.{{Citation needed|date = December 2016}}\n\n==Germania (German-America)==\n[[German immigration to the United States|German immigrants to the United States]], who introduced [[lager]] beer to the United States, also introduced [[beer garden]]s (often attached to breweries) to the U.S. in the mid-19th century.<ref name=Ruschmann>Paul Ruschmann, \"Beer Gardens\" in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America'', ed. Andrew F. Smith (2d ed.: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 155.</ref> The [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company|Schlitz]] Palm Gardens and [[Pabst Brewing Company|Pabst]] Park beer gardens in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], are regarded as precursors to modern theme parks.<ref name=Ruschmann/>\n\nGermans operated nearly all of the nation's [[breweries]], and demand remained high, until [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] arrived in 1920. [[German American#Newspapers|German-American newspapers]] promoted [[temperance movement|temperance]] but not [[abstinence]]. From the German perspective the issue was less the ill effects of alcohol than its benefits in promoting social life. For American Germans, the beer garden stood alongside the church as one of the two pillars of German social and spiritual life.<ref>Perry Duis, ''The Saloon''</ref>\n\n==New York City==\nPerhaps the most famous American tavern is [[Fraunces Tavern]], at the corner of Broad and Pearl streets in lower Manhattan. Originally built as a residence in 1719, it was opened as a tavern by Samuel Fraunces in 1762, and became a much used gathering place. Fraunces Tavern was the site of merchants' meetings on the post-1763 taxes, plots by the [[Sons of Liberty]], entertainments for British and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] officers during the Revolution. In its Long Room, on December 4, 1783, General George Washington said farewell to his officers and family.\n\n==New England==\nThe heavy Puritan heritage of New England meant that local government was strong enough to regulate\u2014and close\u2014rowdy places. But the power of ministers faded, and by the 1690s provincial leaders recognized that they could not eradicate hard drinking in taverns. From that point until after the American Revolution, the tavern was a widely accepted institution in Massachusetts {{Citation needed|reason=This is an empirical claim requiring citation/evidence.|date=June 2018}}.\n\nBetween 1697 and 1756 Elizabeth Harvey, followed by her daughter-in-law Ann Harvey Slayton, operated a successful tavern in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Their careers reveal the public acceptance of female management and authority within the confines of the tavern. Under Harvey, the tavern became a mail stop and began hosting General Assembly and executive committee meetings. After Slayton took over, the tavern held town meetings, supplied necessities to the poor for which the town gave reimbursement, and provided accommodations for the provincial government, courts, and legislative committees.<ref>Marcia Schmidt Blaine, \"Entertaining the Government: Female Tavern Keepers and the New Hampshire Provincial Government\", Proceedings of the Dublin Seminar for New England Folklife: Annual Proceedings 2002, 2002, p. 191-201.</ref>\n\n==Frontier of colonial North Carolina==\nIn colonial North Carolina, taverns had multiple functions. In addition to their functions as accommodation for travelers and as places for eating and drinking, taverns served as places for commerce, informal political discussion, and the spread of news and information.<ref name=\"thorp\"/> In the period 1753\u20131776, the number of taverns operating in the frontier county of [[Rowan County, North Carolina]] in an average year was \"probably closer to forty than ten\" based on taxation and licensure records.<ref name=\"thorp\"/> Overall, distilled spirits such as whiskey, rum, and brandy, were more common than beer. Research shows that the consumption of alcohol varied by place based on the ethnic composition of the tavern's customers: \"The more Scottish a tavern's clientele the more spirits served, and the more German or English its patrons the more beer served.\"<ref name=\"thorp\"/>\n\nWomen were underrepresented as both patrons and operators of colonial North Carolina taverns. This may be partially attributable to the demographics of frontier settlements, which were skewed male.<ref name=\"thorp\"/>\n\n==Ethnic saloons==\nIn ethnic neighborhoods of cities, mill towns and mining camps, the saloonkeeper was an important man. Groups of 25\u201350 recent arrivals speaking the same language\u2014and probably also from the same province or village back in Europe\u2014drank together and frequented the same saloon. They trusted the saloonkeeper to translate and write letters for them, help with transatlantic letters and remittances, keep their savings for them, and explain American laws and customs.<ref>Kingsdale (1973); Duis (1975); Rothbart (1993)</ref>\n\n==Speakeasies==\nThe [[speakeasy]] (or \"blind pig\") was an illegal bar that became extremely common during prohibition (1920\u201333). The term \"speakeasy\" entered the vernacular in Pennsylvania in the late 1880s as illegal saloons flourished when the cost of legal liquor licenses was raised under the Brooks High License law.<ref>''The New York Times'', July 6, 1891</ref> Most taverns closed up, but drinkers found out-of-the-way speakeasies that would serve them. The owners had to buy illegal beer and liquor from criminal syndicates (the most famous was run by [[Al Capone]] in Chicago), and had to pay off the police to look the other way. The result was an overall decrease in drinking and an enormous increase in organized crime, gang warfare and civic corruption, as well as a decline in tax revenue. Prohibition was repealed in 1933 and legitimate places reopened.\n\n{{See also|Prohibition in the United States#Crime and Repeal}}\n\n==Canada==\nRoberts (2008) shows that in [[Upper Canada]] (Ontario) in the early 19th century, there was an informal ritual at work that tavern keepers and patrons followed. For example, the barrooms were reserved for men but adjacent rooms were places where women could meet, families could come, and female sociability flourished. Meanwhile, the local men and visitors such as travelers, doctors, tradespeople, and artists could express their views on topics of general interest.\n\nOccasionally heated arguments would break into fights between religious or ethnic groups.<ref>Roberts (2008)</ref>  Despite efforts by social reformers to regulate taverns in Ontario, physical violence linked to drinking was common. Indeed, 19th-century masculinity, derived from earlier models of fur traders in the region, was often predicated on feats of strength and stamina and on skill in fighting. Taverns were the most common public gathering place for males of the working class and thus the site of frequent confrontations. Men's honor and men's bodies, socially and historically linked, found public, and often destructive, expression in the tavern setting.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2000/JSH2703/JSH2703d.pdf|author=Kevin B.

The poor frequented the pulquer\u00edas where [[pulque]], made from the [[Agave americana|maguey]] plant, was sold. After the legalization of the more potent [[aguardiente]] in 1796, the poor could also afford the vi\u00f1ater\u00edas where hard liquor was served, and drunkenness increased. The taverns played an important social and recreational role in the lives of the poor. Influential citizens often owned the pulcher\u00edas and opposed reform as did owners of the maguey haciendas. Tax revenues from alcohol were important to the government. These factors, added to lax enforcement of the laws, resulted in the failure of tavern reform.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Michael C.

[[Benjamin Franklin]] printed a \"''Drinker's Dictionary''\" in his ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' in 1737, listing some 228 [[slang]] terms used for [[drunkenness]] in [[Philadelphia]].\n\nThe sheer volume of [[hard liquor]] consumption fell off, but the brewing of beer increased and men developed [[customs]] and [[traditions]] based on how to behave at the tavern. By 1900, the 26 million American men over age 18 [[patron]]ized 215,000 [[licensed]] taverns and probably 50,000 unlicensed (illegal) ones, or one per hundred men.<ref>Kingsdale (1973) pp. 472\u20133.

They served mostly beer; bottles were available but most drinkers went to the taverns. Probably half the American men avoided [[Bar (establishment)|saloons]], so the average consumption for actual patrons was about a half-[[gallon]] of beer per day, six days a week. In 1900, the city of [[Boston]] (with about 200,000 adult men) counted 227,000 daily saloon customers.<ref>Kingsdale (1973) pp. 472\u20133.</ref>\n\n==Colonial America to 1800==\nTaverns in the colonies closely followed the ''ordinaries'' of the [[mother country]]. Taverns, along with inns, at first were mostly known as ''ordinaries'', which were constructed throughout most of New England.<ref name=\"Penguin\">{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Iain|title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol|date=2008|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-1-592-40464-3|page=127|edition=1st}}</ref> These institutions were influential in the development of new settlements, serving as gathering spaces for the community.

The ones in the South that are closer to the frontier were used as inns and trading post from those who were headed into the unknown lands to settle.<ref name=\"thorp\"/> The multiple functions of public houses were especially important in frontier communities where other institutions were often weak, and this was certainly true on the southern colonial frontier.<ref name=\"thorp\"/> They were supervised by [[county]] officials who recognized the need for taverns and the need to maintain order, to minimize drunkenness and avoid it if possible on Sundays, as well as to establish the responsibilities of [[tavern keepers]]. With these profits came progress, improving their new homeland with the use of taverns as well as breweries.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Iain|title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol|date=2008|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-1-592-40464-3|page=126|edition=1st}}</ref> The original structure of these taverns were log cabins, typically a storey and a half high with two rooms on each floor. The ground floor was the floor the public could use where the upper level floor was the bedrooms and somewhat removed from the public.\n\n===Earliest hotels===\nLarger taverns provided rooms for travelers, especially in county seats that housed the county court. Upscale taverns had a lounge with a huge fireplace, a bar at one side, plenty of benches and chairs, and several dining tables. The best houses had a separate parlor for ladies because the other part was unclean, an affable landlord, good cooking, soft, roomy beds, fires in all rooms in cold weather, and warming pans used on the beds at night. In the backwoods, the taverns were wretched hovels, dirty with vermin for company; even so they were more pleasant and safer for the stranger than camping by the roadside. Even on main highways such as the Boston Post Road, travelers routinely reported the taverns had bad food, hard beds, scanty blankets, inadequate heat, and poor service. One Sunday in 1789 President [[George Washington]], touring Connecticut, discovered that the locals discouraged travel on the Sabbath, so he spent the day at Perkins Tavern, \"which by the way is not a good one\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank E.

Colonists learned current crop prices, engaged in trade, and heard newspapers read aloud. For most rural Americans the tavern was the chief link to the greater world, playing a role much like the city marketplace of medieval Europe. \n\nTaverns absorbed leisure hours and games were provided. Horse races often began and ended at taverns, as did militia-training exercises. Cockfights were common. At upscale taverns the gentry had private rooms or even organized a club. When politics was in season, or the county court was meeting, political talk filled the taverns.\n\nTaverns served multiple functions on the Southern colonial frontier.  Society in Rowan County, North Carolina, was divided along lines of ethnicity, gender, race, and class, but in taverns the boundaries often overlapped, as diverse groups were brought together at nearby tables. Consumerism in the backcountry was limited not by ideology or culture but by distance from markets and poor transportation. The increasing variety of drinks served and the development of clubs indicates that genteel culture spread rapidly from London to the periphery of the English world.<ref name=\"thorp\">{{cite journal|jstor=2211137|author=Daniel B.

Local magistrates\u2014who had to award a license before a tavern could operate\u2014preferred widows who knew the business and might otherwise be impoverished and become a charge to the county.<ref>Tavern licenses were assigned to men, but both magistrates and license applicants knew that the tavern itself would be run by the petitioner's wife or daughter.</ref> Mainly, because taverns started to become upper-class establishments, calling for more experienced proprietors.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Only licensed ordinaries, though, would usually be able to sell alcohol for consumption with fixed measures for fixed prices.<ref name=\"Penguin\"/> Women and children were not usually welcome as fellow drinkers. In some instances women and children were welcome in taverns but it was mostly a place reserved for men. If women were found in a tavern they were typically considered prostitutes. Women would come into taverns to look for their husbands, or they would come with their fathers or brothers; other than that women were not allowed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Salinger|first1=Sharon|title=Taverns and Drinking in Early America}}</ref> The drinkers were men\u2014and indeed often defined their manliness by how much alcohol they could drink at a time.  The public held standards like keeping an orderly house, selling at prices that were the same as what the law said, and not slandering other tavern keepers, resulting in bad reputations.<ref name=\"thorp\"/>\n\n==Meeting place and community center==\nIn rural communities the tavern was a very important public space. The tavern offered the community not only a place to meet, but also a place to conduct business. The tavern also acted as an improptu court house where rules could be made and disputes could be settled.<ref name=\"thorp\"/> From 1660 to 1665 the Virginia government met in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] at the local taverns. From 1749 to 1779, the [[Mosby Tavern]] was the [[courthouse]], [[jail]], and [[Militia (United States)|militia]] [[wikt:rendezvous|rendezvous]] for [[Cumberland County, Virginia]] and later for [[Powhatan County, Virginia]]. [[Gifford Dalley]] managed [[City Tavern]] in Philadelphia, which served as an unofficial meeting place for the [[First Continental Congress]] and in documents he served as the Keeper of the Door for the First, Second and Third United States Congresses. Daily's brother-in-law [[Samuel Fraunces]] owned [[Fraunces Tavern]] in [[New York City]] where Congress met while City Hall was under construction. The last time Congress met at a tavern it was at Fraunces Tavern. The [[Tun Tavern]] in [[Philadelphia]] is regarded as the place where the [[U.S. Marines]] were first recruited. Neither place still exists. A reconstruction of [[City Tavern]] in Philadelphia is still in operation.\n\n==Mail stop and post office==\nMany were also the local post office and or the polling place. The [[United States Postal Service]] had its origins in the private taverns and [[coffeehouse]]s of America.<ref name=\"NPM Bib\">{{cite web|title=The Postal Service in Colonial America: A Bibliography of Material in the Smithsonian Institution Libraries National Postal Museum Branch | url=http://www.sil.si.edu/SILPublications/postal-history/bibliography/ | work=National Postal Museum|publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}</ref>\n\nA depiction of Civil War troops reading their mail at the Eagle Tavern which doubled as the post office in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] can be seen at the Silver Spring Library. The Old Post Office Tavern is in operation today in Leavenworth, Washington. Old Kelley's Tavern in New Hampshire is a multifunctional tavern. Colonel William B. Kelley of New Hampshire operated a tavern and was the Postmaster General for New Hampshire. The mail came and went from his home. The Hanover Tavern in [[Hanover County, Virginia]] is another tavern which also operated as the post office. The [[General Wayne Inn]] in Lower Merion Pennsylvania also served as a post office from 1830 to 1850 and was also the [[polling place]] in 1806.\n\n==Oldest taverns==\n[[File:White Horse Tavern Newport.JPG|thumb|right|The historic White Horse Tavern in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], in the [[United States]]]]\n[[File:Wayside Inn1.jpg|thumb|right|The Wayside Inn in Sudbury, Massachusetts]]\n[[File:Barroom Dancing by John Lewis Krimmel.jpg|thumb|''Barroom Dancing'', c. 1820, by [[John Lewis Krimmel]]]]\nThe oldest tavern is a distinction claimed by numerous establishments. Some establishments clarify their claims with oldest continuously operating tavern, oldest family-owned tavern, oldest drinking establishment, or oldest licensed; there are many ways to distinguish the oldest tavern. The first tavern in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] was a [[Puritan]] [[public house|ordinary]], opened on March 4, 1633.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hosmer|first=James Kendall (editor)|title=Winthrop's Journal \"History of New England\" 1630-1649|place=New York|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=1908|url=https://archive.org/details/winthropsjourna06hosmgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/winthropsjourna06hosmgoog/page/n142 120]|quote=Winthrop reported that Samuel Cole set up the first house for common entertainment....|ref=harv}}</ref>  That date would have been given under the [[Julian Calendar]], which was in use by England and its colonies at the time.\n\nThe [[White Horse Tavern (Newport, Rhode Island)|White Horse Tavern]], in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], is most likely the Tavern housed in the oldest building {built 1683; licensed 1687}. The Blue Anchor, the first drinking establishment at Front and Dock Streets in [[Philadelphia]], began operation in 1681. [[Jean Lafitte]]'s [[Black Smith Shoppe]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] some claim to be the oldest bar continuously operating before 1775.  Lafitte himself was born in 1776. The [[Wayside Inn]] in Sudbury, Massachusetts, is reputedly the oldest operating inn in America, going back to 1716.{{Citation needed|date = December 2016}}\n\n==Germania (German-America)==\n[[German immigration to the United States|German immigrants to the United States]], who introduced [[lager]] beer to the United States, also introduced [[beer garden]]s (often attached to breweries) to the U.S. in the mid-19th century.<ref name=Ruschmann>Paul Ruschmann, \"Beer Gardens\" in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America'', ed. Andrew F. Smith (2d ed.: Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 155.</ref> The [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company|Schlitz]] Palm Gardens and [[Pabst Brewing Company|Pabst]] Park beer gardens in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], are regarded as precursors to modern theme parks.<ref name=Ruschmann/>\n\nGermans operated nearly all of the nation's [[breweries]], and demand remained high, until [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] arrived in 1920. [[German American#Newspapers|German-American newspapers]] promoted [[temperance movement|temperance]] but not [[abstinence]]. From the German perspective the issue was less the ill effects of alcohol than its benefits in promoting social life. For American Germans, the beer garden stood alongside the church as one of the two pillars of German social and spiritual life.<ref>Perry Duis, ''The Saloon''</ref>\n\n==New York City==\nPerhaps the most famous American tavern is [[Fraunces Tavern]], at the corner of Broad and Pearl streets in lower Manhattan. Originally built as a residence in 1719, it was opened as a tavern by Samuel Fraunces in 1762, and became a much used gathering place. Fraunces Tavern was the site of merchants' meetings on the post-1763 taxes, plots by the [[Sons of Liberty]], entertainments for British and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] officers during the Revolution. In its Long Room, on December 4, 1783, General George Washington said farewell to his officers and family.\n\n==New England==\nThe heavy Puritan heritage of New England meant that local government was strong enough to regulate\u2014and close\u2014rowdy places. But the power of ministers faded, and by the 1690s provincial leaders recognized that they could not eradicate hard drinking in taverns. From that point until after the American Revolution, the tavern was a widely accepted institution in Massachusetts {{Citation needed|reason=This is an empirical claim requiring citation/evidence.|date=June 2018}}.\n\nBetween 1697 and 1756 Elizabeth Harvey, followed by her daughter-in-law Ann Harvey Slayton, operated a successful tavern in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Their careers reveal the public acceptance of female management and authority within the confines of the tavern. Under Harvey, the tavern became a mail stop and began hosting General Assembly and executive committee meetings. After Slayton took over, the tavern held town meetings, supplied necessities to the poor for which the town gave reimbursement, and provided accommodations for the provincial government, courts, and legislative committees.<ref>Marcia Schmidt Blaine, \"Entertaining the Government: Female Tavern Keepers and the New Hampshire Provincial Government\", Proceedings of the Dublin Seminar for New England Folklife: Annual Proceedings 2002, 2002, p. 191-201.</ref>\n\n==Frontier of colonial North Carolina==\nIn colonial North Carolina, taverns had multiple functions. In addition to their functions as accommodation for travelers and as places for eating and drinking, taverns served as places for commerce, informal political discussion, and the spread of news and information.<ref name=\"thorp\"/> In the period 1753\u20131776, the number of taverns operating in the frontier county of [[Rowan County, North Carolina]] in an average year was \"probably closer to forty than ten\" based on taxation and licensure records.<ref name=\"thorp\"/> Overall, distilled spirits such as whiskey, rum, and brandy, were more common than beer. Research shows that the consumption of alcohol varied by place based on the ethnic composition of the tavern's customers: \"The more Scottish a tavern's clientele the more spirits served, and the more German or English its patrons the more beer served.\"<ref name=\"thorp\"/>\n\nWomen were underrepresented as both patrons and operators of colonial North Carolina taverns. This may be partially attributable to the demographics of frontier settlements, which were skewed male.<ref name=\"thorp\"/>\n\n==Ethnic saloons==\nIn ethnic neighborhoods of cities, mill towns and mining camps, the saloonkeeper was an important man. Groups of 25\u201350 recent arrivals speaking the same language\u2014and probably also from the same province or village back in Europe\u2014drank together and frequented the same saloon. They trusted the saloonkeeper to translate and write letters for them, help with transatlantic letters and remittances, keep their savings for them, and explain American laws and customs.<ref>Kingsdale (1973); Duis (1975); Rothbart (1993)</ref>\n\n==Speakeasies==\nThe [[speakeasy]] (or \"blind pig\") was an illegal bar that became extremely common during prohibition (1920\u201333). The term \"speakeasy\" entered the vernacular in Pennsylvania in the late 1880s as illegal saloons flourished when the cost of legal liquor licenses was raised under the Brooks High License law.<ref>''The New York Times'', July 6, 1891</ref> Most taverns closed up, but drinkers found out-of-the-way speakeasies that would serve them. The owners had to buy illegal beer and liquor from criminal syndicates (the most famous was run by [[Al Capone]] in Chicago), and had to pay off the police to look the other way. The result was an overall decrease in drinking and an enormous increase in organized crime, gang warfare and civic corruption, as well as a decline in tax revenue. Prohibition was repealed in 1933 and legitimate places reopened.\n\nSee also: [[Prohibition in the United States#Crime and Repeal]].\n\n==Canada==\nRoberts (2008) shows that in [[Upper Canada]] (Ontario) in the early 19th century, there was an informal ritual at work that tavern keepers and patrons followed. For example, the barrooms were reserved for men but adjacent rooms were places where women could meet, families could come, and female sociability flourished. Meanwhile, the local men and visitors such as travelers, doctors, tradespeople, and artists could express their views on topics of general interest.\n\nOccasionally heated arguments would break into fights between religious or ethnic groups.<ref>Roberts (2008)</ref>  Despite efforts by social reformers to regulate taverns in Ontario, physical violence linked to drinking was common. Indeed, 19th-century masculinity, derived from earlier models of fur traders in the region, was often predicated on feats of strength and stamina and on skill in fighting. Taverns were the most common public gathering place for males of the working class and thus the site of frequent confrontations. Men's honor and men's bodies, socially and historically linked, found public, and often destructive, expression in the tavern setting.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2000/JSH2703/JSH2703d.pdf|author=Kevin B.

The poor frequented the pulquer\u00edas where [[pulque]], made from the [[Agave americana|maguey]] plant, was sold. After the legalization of the more potent [[aguardiente]] in 1796, the poor could also afford the vi\u00f1ater\u00edas where hard liquor was served, and drunkenness increased. The taverns played an important social and recreational role in the lives of the poor. Influential citizens often owned the pulcher\u00edas and opposed reform as did owners of the maguey haciendas. Tax revenues from alcohol were important to the government. These factors, added to lax enforcement of the laws, resulted in the failure of tavern reform.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Michael C.

The hope was expressed that Cambridge would follow suit, and that the Varsity races would soon resume. It did not, though, prove possible to organize a challenge race prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]], mobilization for which stripped Oxford (and Cambridge) of most of its students and led to the disappearance of the so-recently reconstituted club. \n\nDuring the 1950/51 academic year a small club was once again active, though mainly for the purposes of recreational cycling. In the following year it acquired a handful of keen racing members, among them the ebullient Malcolm Prince (Jesus Coll.) who, with Brian Stackhouse (University Coll.) cycled to London to represent the club at the inaugural meeting of the British Universities' Cycling Union (BUCU). In 1953, the club organized the BUCU 25-mile T.T. championship and later in the same year it competed against the Cambridge University Cycle Racing Club (now CUCC) in a \"3-up\"  team time trial on a \"neutral\" course near [[Whipsnade]]. Cambridge \"rode over\" to win, after the Oxford team suffered mechanical failure.  The club at this time had a single female member, Margaret Wilkinson (Lady Margaret Hall) , while J. B. Leishman (St. John's Coll.), the translator of the poems of [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke,]]<ref>Letter, M. V. Prince to the editor of ''Oxford Today,'' 13 December 1997,  in reply to letter of Peter Hopkins to the same: 'Letters', ''Oxford Today'' 10.1 (Hilary Term 1997).</ref> was persuaded to serve as the obligatory Senior Member. \n\nAfter another brief hiatus, the club was restarted in Michaelmas Term 1957 by Peter Hopkins (Exeter Coll.), Jim Thompson and Bill Speck (both Queen's Coll.), and a formal constitution was drawn up and approved by a large, new membership. The only non-University, associate members allowed by the Proctors were the three senior officers of Oxford City Road Club, in recognition of the city club's friendly disposition to University cyclists.The club immediately joined the [[National Cyclists' Union]] and also became affiliated (for road racing) to the break-away [[British League of Racing Cyclists]]. The club gained its first female members at this time. The first woman to join was\u00a0 Anne Sims (St. Anne\u2019s Coll.) in October 1957, with others soon following. Sunday club-runs became well supported and separate training rides were established. Touring immediately flourished within the club, co-existing happily with the racing imperative,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=Michael|title=Re: Cyclists. 200 Years on Two Wheels|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4729-2559-6|location=London|pages=256-7}}</ref> and the first touring weekend took place during the Christmas vacation of 1957\u201358. In 1958, following a challenge from Cambridge, who had heard of the OUCC.'s revival, the first Varsity Match of the current series was held; the contest being for a Varsity Shield, to be retained by the winning club until the next encounter.\n\nIn its modern form, the annual Varsity Match has normally taken the form of a 25-mile individual time trial held on open roads under [[Cycling Time Trials]] (formerly RTTC) rules. An exception was the 1976 contest, which was decided over 10 miles. There is no limit on the number of University entrants, nor is parity of numbers required. The teams are decided by the results, as the three fastest times set by riders of each club are added together, and the winner is deemed to be the club with the lower of the two aggregate times. A Women's Varsity Match was introduced as soon as there were enough racing members in each club to form teams. OUCC. hosts the event on its local roads in even years, and CUCC in odd years. \n\nIn the 1960's and 1970's, a much-diminished membership reflected the national decline in cycle sport and cycling in general. Fortunately for the survival of OUCC, a steady trickle of committed \u2018club\u2019 cyclists, who already belonged to their local clubs and had raced as juniors, passed through the University club. As well as maintaining, through several lean years, all the essential events in the club calendar, including the inter-college \u2018Cuppers\u2019 10-miles time trial, the club promoted the 1962 UAU. 50-mile championship time trial, in which it won its first individual and team medals at British Universities level; only [[Roy Cromack]], then riding for Sheffield University, denying Bill Fowler (Keble Coll.) the gold. The outstanding racing member of the mid-to-late \u201860s was Mark Carritt (Univ. Coll.), a typical OUCC. \u2018all-rounder\u2019, though very untypical in that he excelled at every form of cycling competition. Carritt took the Bucks-Oxon-Berks road race title twice, as well as the British Universities road race, while in time trials he was among the best British 12-hour riders of his day, and, at the 25-mile distance,\u00a0was the first OUCC rider to break the hour, recording a time of 58 minutes and 4 seconds in the 1968 Varsity Match. \n\nIn the early-to-mid 1970's, the club developed an interest in very long-distance rides, which included far-ranging vacation tours. It was through their membership of OUCC that the highly successful tandem tricycle pairing of Stuart Jackson and Edwin Hargraves came together, which took multiple United Kingdom place-to-place records. By the end of the 1970's, the  racing membership of the club had dwindled to six including the Senior Member, Rolls Royce Junior Research Fellow Lawrence Daniels (Keble Coll.). Defiantly, it entered teams in \u201c3-up\u201d and \u201c4-up\u201d time-trial \u201cOpen\u201d events. This was the nadir of the modern-era club, but the demises of 1902 and 1939 were not to be repeated. The club began to grow, and in 1981, for the first time in its history, OUCC gained sponsorship. This came from Competition Cycles of Cricklewood, London,\u00a0whose proprietor, Colin Freud (Christ Church Coll.), was a former member. Evidence of resurgence came in the windswept Varsity Match of 1982 in which six Oxford riders (also six Cambridge riders), riding the un-aerodynamic, steel bicycles of the era, all broke the hour for the 25-mile distance.<ref>\"Varsity Verve\", ''Oxford Mail,'' 12 May 1982.</ref>\n\nIn the last decades of the century, a growing club membership and an improving gender ratio made possible a fuller club programme. The racing section embraced science-informed training methods, introduced in the early 1980's by research neurologist and club coach, Dr Eugene \"Gene\" Merrill. Performance testing and computer analysis was subsequently brought in by [[Dick Poole (cyclist)|Dick Poole]], the club's performance adviser of the mid-1980's. A fortuitous kerbside meeting in 2007 led to the club benefiting from the coaching services of former [[Giro d'Italia]] rider Flavio Zappi. The drive for competition success at Oxford, however, has never been at the expense of\u00a0cycling for sheer enjoyment.\u00a0While its Cambridge rival has always succeeded in focusing on the Varsity Match, OUCC (like the D.B.B.C. and O.U.Bi.C. before it) has a more wayward history. Writers have observed that the spirit of the [[Scholar Gypsy]] affects cycling at Oxford generally, attributing this partly to the nature of Oxfordshire's country lanes and the county's characteristic topography and scenery.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Jan|title=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-280136-8|location=Oxford|pages=107}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffin|first=Penny|title=St Hugh\u2019s: One Hundred Years of Women\u2019s Education in Oxford|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|isbn=978-1-349-07727-4|location=Basingstoke and London|pages=118}}</ref> The local woods now provide trails for one of the club's relatively recent accretions, the mountain biking section. Mountain biking, by virtue of ts popularity, has earned its own Varsity Match, held annually as a cross-country (XC) race, in which, like the traditional road time-trial event, the winning team is deemed to be that which finishes with the lowest aggregate time. \n\n==Inter-university achievements==\nIn 1983, the club returned to British Universities competition. In that year, it hosted the BUSF/BSSF. 50-mile championship and, a few weeks later, won the team category for the BUSF/BSSF<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/c8d24e5e-5284-34be-9efc-693894b5b8b4|title=British Universities' Sports Association Records Administrative/Biographical History|last=|first=|date=|website=Jisc Archives Hub|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref> 100-mile championship in South Lancashire. Since then, OUCC has been highly successful in competition, particularly in inter-university championships, gaining [[British Universities & Colleges Sport|BUCS]] / BSSF titles in every type of road racing event; notable winning years being 1990 (Jonathan Atkinson: individual Hill-Climb), 1991 (S.

Jim Henderson was riding for OUCC when he won the first of his five National hill climb titles on Dover's Hill in 1998.  2000 proved to be an outstanding year for the women's team which that year won golds in the BUSA Hill Climb and the [[Cyclo-cross]] race, while achieving overall second place in the track championships.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spencer|first=Will|last2=Jones|first2=Piers|date=2000|title=Sports Review 2000|url=|journal=University of Oxford Sports Review|volume=|pages=7|via=}}</ref> In 2015, Olivia Withers (L.M.H.), Imogen Kempton (Lincoln Coll.), and Tamara Davenne (Merton Coll.), of the newly formed women's racing squad, won the BUCS \"3-up\" team time trial, with Devenne also winning the BUCS circuit road race.\n\n==Notable alumni<ref>Notability solely in the context of cycling, including achievements before, during and after membership of the club.</ref>==\n* A.

The club gained its first female members at this time. The first woman to join was\u00a0 Anne Sims (St. Anne\u2019s Coll.) in October 1957, with others soon following. Sunday club-runs became well supported and separate training rides were established. Touring immediately flourished within the club, co-existing happily with the racing imperative,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=Michael|title=Re: Cyclists. 200 Years on Two Wheels|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2017|isbn=978-1-4729-2559-6|location=London|pages=256-7}}</ref> and the first touring weekend took place during the Christmas vacation of 1957\u201358. In 1958, following a challenge from Cambridge, who had heard of the OUCC.'s revival, the first Varsity Match of the current series was held; the contest being for a Varsity Shield, to be retained by the winning club until the next encounter.\n\nIn its modern form, the annual Varsity Match has normally taken the form of a 25-mile individual time trial held on open roads under [[Cycling Time Trials]] (formerly RTTC) rules. An exception was the 1976 contest, which was decided over 10 miles. There is no limit on the number of University entrants, nor is parity of numbers required. The teams are decided by the results, as the three fastest times set by riders of each club are added together, and the winner is deemed to be the club with the lower of the two aggregate times. A Women's Varsity Match was introduced as soon as there were enough racing members in each club to form teams. OUCC. hosts the event on its local roads in even years, and CUCC in odd years. \n\nIn the 1960's and 1970's, a much-diminished membership reflected the national decline in cycle sport and cycling in general. Fortunately for the survival of OUCC, a steady trickle of committed \u2018club\u2019 cyclists, who already belonged to their local clubs and had raced as juniors, passed through the University club. As well as maintaining, through several lean years, all the essential events in the club calendar, including the inter-college \u2018Cuppers\u2019 10-miles time trial, the club promoted the 1962 UAU. 50-mile championship time trial, in which it won its first individual and team medals at British Universities level; only [[Roy Cromack]], then riding for Sheffield University, denying Bill Fowler (Keble Coll.) the gold. The outstanding racing member of the mid-to-late \u201860s was Mark Carritt (Univ. Coll.), a typical OUCC. \u2018all-rounder\u2019, though very untypical in that he excelled at every form of cycling competition. Carritt took the Bucks-Oxon-Berks road race title twice, as well as the British Universities road race, while in time trials he was among the best British 12-hour riders of his day, and, at the 25-mile distance,\u00a0was the first OUCC rider to break the hour, recording a time of 58 minutes and 4 seconds in the 1968 Varsity Match. \n\nIn the early-to-mid 1970's, the club developed an interest in very long-distance rides, which included far-ranging vacation tours. It was through their membership of OUCC that the highly successful tandem tricycle pairing of Stuart Jackson and Edwin Hargraves came together, which took multiple United Kingdom place-to-place records. By the end of the 1970's, the  racing membership of the club had dwindled to six including the Senior Member, Rolls Royce Junior Research Fellow Lawrence Daniels (Keble Coll.). Defiantly, it entered teams in \u201c3-up\u201d and \u201c4-up\u201d time-trial \u201cOpen\u201d events. This was the nadir of the modern-era club, but the demises of 1902 and 1939 were not to be repeated. The club began to grow, and in 1981, for the first time in its history, OUCC gained sponsorship. This came from Competition Cycles of Cricklewood, London,\u00a0whose proprietor, Colin Freud (Christ Church Coll.), was a former member. Evidence of resurgence came in the windswept Varsity Match of 1982 in which six Oxford riders (also six Cambridge riders), riding the un-aerodynamic, steel bicycles of the era, all broke the hour for the 25-mile distance.<ref>\"Varsity Verve\", ''Oxford Mail,'' 12 May 1982.</ref>\n\nIn the last decades of the century, a growing club membership and an improving gender ratio made possible a fuller club programme. The racing section embraced science-informed training methods, introduced in the early 1980's by research neurologist and club coach, Dr Eugene \"Gene\" Merrill. Performance testing and computer analysis was subsequently brought in by [[Dick Poole (cyclist)|Dick Poole]], the club's performance adviser of the mid-1980's. A fortuitous kerbside meeting in 2007 led to the club benefiting from the coaching services of former [[Giro d'Italia]] rider Flavio Zappi. The drive for competition success at Oxford, however, has never been at the expense of\u00a0cycling for sheer enjoyment.\u00a0While its Cambridge rival has always succeeded in focusing on the Varsity Match, OUCC (like the D.B.B.C. and O.U.Bi.C. before it) has a more wayward history. Writers have observed that the spirit of the [[Scholar Gypsy]] affects cycling at Oxford generally, attributing this partly to the nature of Oxfordshire's country lanes and the county's characteristic topography and scenery.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Jan|title=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-280136-8|location=Oxford|pages=107}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Griffin|first=Penny|title=St Hugh\u2019s: One Hundred Years of Women\u2019s Education in Oxford|publisher=Macmillan|year=1986|isbn=978-1-349-07727-4|location=Basingstoke and London|pages=118}}</ref> The local woods now provide trails for one of the club's relatively recent accretions, the mountain biking section. Mountain biking, by virtue of ts popularity, has earned its own Varsity Match, held annually as a cross-country (XC) race, in which, like the traditional road time-trial event, the winning team is deemed to be that which finishes with the lowest aggregate time. \n\n==Inter-university achievements==\nIn 1983, the club returned to British Universities competition. In that year, it hosted the BUSF/BSSF. 50-mile championship and, a few weeks later, won the team category for the BUSF/BSSF<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/c8d24e5e-5284-34be-9efc-693894b5b8b4|title=British Universities' Sports Association Records Administrative/Biographical History|last=|first=|date=|website=Jisc Archives Hub|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=16 February 2020}}</ref> 100-mile championship in South Lancashire.

Jim Henderson was riding for OUCC when he won the first of his five National hill climb titles on Dover's Hill in 1998.  2000 proved to be an outstanding year for the women's team which that year won golds in the BUSA Hill Climb and the [[Cyclo-cross]] race, while achieving overall second place in the track championships.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spencer|first=Will|last2=Jones|first2=Piers|date=2000|title=Sports Review 2000|url=|journal=University of Oxford Sports Review|volume=|pages=7|via=}}</ref> In 2015, Olivia Withers (L.M.H.), Imogen Kempton (Lincoln Coll.), and Tamara Davenne (Merton Coll.), of the newly formed women's racing squad, won the BUCS \"3-up\" team time trial, with Devenne also winning the BUCS circuit road race.\n\n==Notable alumni<ref>Notability solely in the context of cycling, including achievements before, during and after membership of the club.</ref>==\n* A.
