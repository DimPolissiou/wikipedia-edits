Some dates are approximate (indicated with a \"circa\" or \"c.\") and based on architectural studies and historical records, while other dates are based on [[dendrochronology]]. All entries should include citation with reference to: 17th century architectural features; a report by an architectural historian; or dendrochronology.  Sites on the list are generally from the [[First Period]] of American architecture. Only [[First Period]] houses built prior to 1700 are suitable for inclusion on this list or the building must be the oldest of its type.\n\nThe [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|Fairbanks House]] (built 1637-1641) is the oldest house verified using dendrochronology, followed by the [[James Blake House]] (built in 1661), but most First Period structures in Massachusetts have not yet been tested with dendrochronology surveys.

Some dates are approximate (indicated with a \"circa\" or \"c.\") and based on architectural studies and historical records, while other dates are based on [[dendrochronology]]. All entries should include citation with reference to: 17th century architectural features; a report by an architectural historian; or dendrochronology.  Sites on the list are generally from the [[First Period]] of American architecture. Only [[First Period]] houses built prior to 1700 are suitable for inclusion on this list or the building must be the oldest of its type.\n\nThe [[Fairbanks House (Dedham, Massachusetts)|Fairbanks House]] (built 1637-1641) is the oldest house verified using dendrochronology, followed by the [[James Blake House]] (built in 1661), but most First Period structures in Massachusetts have not yet been tested with dendrochronology surveys.

It also marked the later years of [[scholasticism]]\n\n==Eastern Orthodoxy==\n\n===Reunion attempts===\nThe eastern Emperor [[John VIII Palaeologus]], pressed hard by the [[Ottoman Turks]], was keen to ally himself with the West, and to do so he arranged with [[Pope Eugene IV]] for discussions about reunion to be held again, this time at the [[Council of Ferrara-Florence]]. After several long discussions, the emperor managed to convince the Eastern representatives to accept the Western doctrines of Filioque, Purgatory and the supremacy of the Papacy. On 6 June 1439, an agreement was signed by all the Eastern bishops present but one, [[Mark of Ephesus]], who held that Rome continued in both [[heresy]] and [[Schism (religion)|schism]]. It seemed that the Great Schism had been ended. However, upon their return, the Eastern bishops found their agreement with the West broadly rejected by the populace and by civil authorities (with the notable exception of the emperors of the East who remained committed to union until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] two decades later). The union signed at Florence has never been accepted by the Eastern churches.  Gay\n\n=== Fall of Constantinople ===\n[[File:Theofilos Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Painting by the Greek folk painter [[Theophilos Hatzimihail]] showing the battle inside the city, Constantine is visible on a white horse]]\nIn 1453, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. But Orthodoxy was still very strong in [[Russia]] which became autocephalous (since 1448, although this was not officially accepted by Constantinople until 1589); and thus [[Moscow]] called itself the [[Third Rome]], as the cultural heir of [[Constantinople]].\n\nEastern Christians expressed a belief that the fall of Constantinople was God's punishment for the emperor and clergy accepting the West's doctrines of [[filioque]], [[purgatory]] and the supremacy of the [[papacy]]. The West did not fulfill its promise to the Eastern emperor of troops and support if he agreed to the reconciliation. The [[Sack of Constantinople]] is still considered proof by the East that the West ultimately succeeded in its endeavor to destroy the East.\n\nUnder Ottoman rule, the Orthodox Church acquired power as an autonomous millet. The ecumenical patriarch was the religious and administrative ruler of the entire [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)#Orthodox Christians|Rum Millet]] (Ottoman administrative unit), which encompassed all the Eastern Orthodox subjects of the empire. Those appointed to the role were chosen by the Muslims rulers not the Church.\n\nAs a result of the Ottoman conquest, the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became suddenly isolated from the West. For the next four hundred years, it was confined within the Islamic world, with which it had little in common religiously or culturally. The Orthodox Churches from [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] states, [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] were the only part of the Orthodox communion that remained outside the control of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n[[File:Stavronikita Aug2006.jpg|thumb|330px|right|Stavronikita monastery, South-East view]]\n\n===Isolation from the West===\nAs a result of the Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, and the [[Fall of Constantinople]], the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became suddenly isolated from the West. For the next four hundred years, it was confined within a hostile Islamic world, with which it had little in common religiously or culturally. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was the only part of the Orthodox communion which remained outside the control of the Ottoman Empire. It is, in part, due to this geographical and intellectual confinement that the voice of Eastern Orthodoxy was not heard during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th-century Europe. As a result, this important theological debate often seems strange and distorted to the Orthodox. They never took part in it and thus neither Reformation nor [[Counter-Reformation]] is part of their theological framework.\n\n===Religious rights under the Ottoman Empire===\n{{Further|Islam and anti-Christian persecution}}\n[[Islam]] recognized [[Jesus]] as a great prophet and considered Christians as another [[People of the Book]]. But it imposed severe penalties including frequent deaths for non Muslims. As such, the Church was not extinguished nor was its canonical and hierarchical organization completely destroyed. Its administration continued to function though in lesser degree, no longer being the state religion. One of the first things that [[Mehmed II|Mehmet the Conqueror]] did was to allow the Church to elect a new patriarch, [[Gennadius Scholarius]]. The [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Parthenon]], which had been Christian churches for nearly a millennium, were converted into mosques, yet most other churches, both in Constantinople and elsewhere, remained in Christian hands. Because [[Sharia|Islamic law]] makes no distinction between nationality and religion, all Christians, regardless of their language or nationality, were considered a single [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]], or nation. The patriarch, as the highest ranking hierarch, was thus invested with civil and religious authority and made [[ethnarch]], head of the entire Christian Orthodox population. Practically, this meant that all Orthodox Churches within Ottoman territory were under the control of Constantinople. Thus, the authority and jurisdictional frontiers of the patriarch were enormously enlarged.\n\nHowever, these [[Dhimmitude|rights and privileges]], including freedom of worship and religious organisation, were often established in principle but seldom corresponded to reality. The legal privileges of the patriarch and the Church depended, in fact, on the whim and mercy of the [[Sultan]] and the [[Sublime Porte]], while all Christians were viewed as second-class citizens. Moreover, Turkish corruption and brutality were not a myth. That it was the \"infidel\" Christian who experienced this more than anyone else is not in doubt. Nor were pogroms of Christians in these centuries unknown (see [[Greco-Turkish relations]]).<ref name=AIHG-NYT>[http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm The Australian Institute for Holocaust and Genocide Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607184704/http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm |date=2007-06-07 }} ''The New York Times''.</ref><ref>http://www.helleniccomserve.com/pdf/BlkBkPontusPrinceton.pdf</ref> Devastating, too, for the Church was the fact that it could not bear witness to Christ. Missionary work among Muslims was dangerous and indeed impossible, whereas conversion to Islam was entirely legal and permissible. Converts to Islam who returned to Orthodoxy were put to death as apostates. No new churches could be built, and even the ringing of church bells was prohibited. Education of the clergy and the Christian population either ceased altogether or was reduced to the most rudimentary elements.\n\n===Corruption===\nThe Orthodox Church found itself subject to the Turkish system of corruption. The patriarchal throne was frequently sold to the highest bidder, while new patriarchal investiture was accompanied by heavy payment to the government. In order to recoup their losses, patriarchs and bishops taxed the local parishes and their clergy. The patriarchal throne was never secure. Few patriarchs between the 15th and the 19th centuries died a natural death while in office. The forced abdications, exiles, hangings, drownings, and poisonings of patriarchs are well documented. But if the patriarch's position was precarious so was the hierarchy's.\n\n===Devshirmeh===\n[[Devshirmeh]] was the system of the collection of young boys from conquered Christian lands by the Ottoman sultans as a form of regular taxation in order to build a loyal  army (formerly largely composed of war captives) and the class of (military) administrators called the \"[[Janissary|Janissaries]]\", or other servants such as tellak in hamams. The word ''dev\u015firme'' means \"collecting, gathering\" in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. Boys delivered to the Ottomans in this way were called ''[[ghilm\u00e1n]]'' or ''acemi oglanlar'' (\"novice boys\").\n\n===Antioch===\nThe Church of Antioch was moved to [[Damascus]] in response to the Ottoman invasion of Antioch. Its traditional territory includes Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and parts of Turkey. The remainder of the Church of Antioch, primarily local Greeks or Hellenized sections of the indigenous population, remained in communion with Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, and Jerusalem\n\n==Western Christianity==\n\n===Western Schism ===\n{{Main|Western Schism}}\n\nIn 1409, a council was convened at [[Pisa]] to resolve the issue. The council declared both existing popes to be schismatic ([[Gregory XII]] from Rome; [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] from Avignon) and appointed a new one, [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]]. But the existing popes refused to resign, and thus there were three papal claimants. Another council was convened in 1414, the [[Council of Constance]]. In March 1415 the Pisan pope, [[John XXIII]], fled from Constance in disguise; he was brought back a prisoner and deposed in May. The Roman pope, Gregory XII, resigned voluntarily in July. The Avignon pope, Benedict XIII, refused to come to Constance; nor would he consider resignation. The council finally deposed him in July 1417. The council in Constance, having finally cleared the field of popes and antipopes, elected [[Pope Martin V]] as pope in November.\n\n=== Italian Renaissance (1399\u20131599) ===\n[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cropncleaned.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Michelangelo's ''Piet\u00e0'' in St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City]]\nThe [[Italian Renaissance]] was a period of great cultural change and achievement, marked in Italy by a classical orientation and an increase of wealth through mercantile trade. The city of Rome, the Papacy, and the Papal States were all affected by the Renaissance. On the one hand, it was a time of great artistic patronage and architectural magnificence, where the Church supported such artists as [[Michelangelo]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], [[Raphael]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Donatello]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. On the other hand, wealthy Italian families often secured episcopal offices, including the papacy, for their own members, some of whom were known for immorality, such as [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] and [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]].\n\n===Scholasticism===\nScholastic theology continued to develop as the 13th century gave way to the fourteenth, becoming ever more complex and subtle in its distinctions and arguments.  The 14th century saw in particular the rise to dominance of the [[nominalism|nominalist]] or [[voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarist]] theologies of men like [[William of Ockham]].  The 14th century was also a time in which movements of widely varying character worked for the reform of the institutional church, such as [[conciliarism]], [[Lollardy]] and the [[Hussite]]s.  Spiritual movements such as the [[Devotio Moderna]] also flourished.\n\nNotable authors include:\n[[File:Hus na kazatelne.jpg|thumb|right|160pf|Jan Hus preaching, illumination from a Czech manuscript, 1490s]]\n* [[Jan Hus]] (c.1369\u20131415)\n* [[Pierre d'Ailly]] (1351\u20131420)\n* [[Jean Gerson]] (1363\u20131429)\n* [[Nicholas of Clemanges]] (1360\u20131440)\n* [[Nicholas of Cusa]] (1401\u20131464)\n* [[Thomas a Kempis]] (1380\u20131471)\n* [[Denis the Carthusian]] (1402\u20131471)\n* [[Rudolf Agricola]] (1444\u20131485)\n* [[Wessel Gansfort]] (1419\u20131489)\n* [[Gabriel Biel]] (1425\u20131495)\n* [[Johann Heynlin]] (1425\u20131496) \n* [[Girolamo Savonarola]] (1452\u20131498)\n* [[Jan Standonck]] (1454\u20131504)\n* [[Conrad Celtis]] (1459\u20131508)\n* [[Johann Geiler]] (1445\u20131510)\n* [[John Colet]] (1467\u20131519)\n* [[Johann Reuchlin]] (1455\u20131522)\n* [[Ulrich von Hutten]] (1488\u20131523)\n* [[Johann von Staupitz]] (1460\u20131524)\n* [[Jacob Wimpfeling]] (1450\u20131528)\n* [[Jacques Lefevre d'Etaples]] (1455\u20131536)\n* [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (1466\u20131536)\n\n===Protestant Reformation roots and precursors===\n{{see also|Bohemian Reformation}}\n[[Image: Jagie\u0142\u0142o dispute.JPG|right|thumb|Hussite theologians dispute in the presence of King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] of Poland]]\nThe Council of Constance confirmed strengthened the traditional medieval conception of Churches and Empires. It did not address the national tensions or the theological tensions which had been stirred up during the previous century. The council could not prevent [[Schism (religion)|schisms]] and the [[Hussite Wars]] in [[Bohemia]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hussites |volume=14 |pages=7\u20139 |first=Franti\u0161ek |last=L\u00fctzow }}</ref>\n\nHistorical upheaval usually yields much new thinking as to how society should be organized. This was the case leading up to the Protestant Reformation. Following the breakdown of monastic institutions and [[scholasticism]] in late medieval Europe, accentuated by the \"Babylonian Captivity\" of the Avignon Papacy, the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]], and the failure of the [[Conciliar movement]], the 16th century saw the fomenting of a great cultural debate about religious reforms and later fundamental religious values. Historians would generally assume that the failure to reform (too many vested interests, lack of coordination in the reforming coalition) would eventually lead to a greater upheaval or even revolution since the system must eventually be adjusted or disintegrate, and the failure of the Conciliar movement helped lead to the [[Protestant Reformation]] in Europe. These frustrated reformist movements ranged from [[nominalism]], [[Devotio Moderna|devotio moderna (modern devotion)]], to [[humanism]] occurring in conjunction with economic, political and demographic forces that contributed to a growing disaffection with the wealth and power of the elite [[clergy]], sensitizing the population to the financial and moral corruption of the secular [[Renaissance]] church.\n\nThe outcome of the [[Black Death]] encouraged a radical reorganization of the economy and eventually of European society. In the emerging urban centers, however, the calamities of the 14th and early 15th century, and the resultant labor shortages, provided a strong impetus for economic diversification and technological innovations. Following the Black Death, the initial loss of life from famine, plague, and pestilence contributed to an intensification of [[capital accumulation]] in the urban areas and thus a stimulus to trade, industry, and burgeoning urban growth in fields as diverse as banking (the [[Fugger]] banking family in [[Augsburg]] and the [[Medici]] family of [[Florence]] being the most prominent); textiles, [[Weapon|armaments]], especially stimulated by the [[Hundred Years' War]], and mining of iron ore with the booming armaments industry. Accumulation of surplus, competitive [[overproduction]], and heightened competition to maximize economic advantage contributed to civil war, aggressive [[militarism]], and thus to centralization. As a direct result of the move toward centralization, leaders like [[Louis XI of France]] sought to remove all constitutional restrictions on the exercise of their authority. In [[England]], [[France]], and [[Spain]] the move toward centralization begun in the 13th century was carried to a successful conclusion.\n\nBut as recovery and prosperity progressed, enabling the population to reach its former levels in the late 15th and 16th centuries, the combination of both a newly-abundant labor supply as well as improved productivity, were 'mixed blessings' for many segments of Western European society. Despite tradition, landlords started the move to exclude [[peasant]]s from \"[[common land]]s\". With trade stimulated, landowners increasingly moved away from the [[Manorialism|manorial]] economy. Woolen manufacturing greatly expanded in [[France]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]] and new textile industries began to develop.\n\nThe invention of [[movable type]] leads to the Protestant zeal for translating the Bible and getting it into the hands of the laity.  This would advance the culture of Biblical literacy.\n\nThe \"humanism\" of the [[Renaissance]] period stimulated unprecedented academic ferment, and a concern for [[academic freedom]]. Ongoing, earnest theoretical debates occurred in the universities about the nature of the church, and the source and extent of the authority of the papacy, of councils, and of princes.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Gonz\u00e1lez | first = Justo L.\n | title = The Story of Christianity: Vol. 1: The Early Church to the Reformation\n | url = https://archive.org/details/storyofchristian01gonz | url-access = registration | location = San Francisco\n | publisher = Harper\n | year = 1984\n | isbn = 0-06-063315-8\n }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Latourette\n | first = Kenneth Scott\n | authorlink = Kenneth Scott Latourette\n | title = A History of Christianity, Volume 1: Beginnings to 1500 (Revised)\n | year = 1975\n | location = San Francisco\n | publisher = Harper\n | isbn = 0-06-064952-6\n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/historyofchristi01lato\n }}</ref>\n\n==Spread of Christianity==\nThrough the late 15th and early 16th centuries, European missionaries and explorers spread Catholicism to the [[Americas]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Oceania]].

It also marked the later years of [[scholasticism]]\n\n==Eastern Orthodoxy==\n\n===Reunion attempts===\nThe eastern Emperor [[John VIII Palaeologus]], pressed hard by the [[Ottoman Turks]], was keen to ally himself with the West, and to do so he arranged with [[Pope Eugene IV]] for discussions about reunion to be held again, this time at the [[Council of Ferrara-Florence]]. After several long discussions, the emperor managed to convince the Eastern representatives to accept the Western doctrines of Filioque, Purgatory and the supremacy of the Papacy. On 6 June 1439, an agreement was signed by all the Eastern bishops present but one, [[Mark of Ephesus]], who held that Rome continued in both [[heresy]] and [[Schism (religion)|schism]]. It seemed that the Great Schism had been ended. However, upon their return, the Eastern bishops found their agreement with the West broadly rejected by the populace and by civil authorities (with the notable exception of the emperors of the East who remained committed to union until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] two decades later). The union signed at Florence has never been accepted by the Eastern churches.\n\n=== Fall of Constantinople ===\n[[File:Theofilos Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Painting by the Greek folk painter [[Theophilos Hatzimihail]] showing the battle inside the city, Constantine is visible on a white horse]]\nIn 1453, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. But Orthodoxy was still very strong in [[Russia]] which became autocephalous (since 1448, although this was not officially accepted by Constantinople until 1589); and thus [[Moscow]] called itself the [[Third Rome]], as the cultural heir of [[Constantinople]].\n\nEastern Christians expressed a belief that the fall of Constantinople was God's punishment for the emperor and clergy accepting the West's doctrines of [[filioque]], [[purgatory]] and the supremacy of the [[papacy]]. The West did not fulfill its promise to the Eastern emperor of troops and support if he agreed to the reconciliation. The [[Sack of Constantinople]] is still considered proof by the East that the West ultimately succeeded in its endeavor to destroy the East.\n\nUnder Ottoman rule, the Orthodox Church acquired power as an autonomous millet. The ecumenical patriarch was the religious and administrative ruler of the entire [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)#Orthodox Christians|Rum Millet]] (Ottoman administrative unit), which encompassed all the Eastern Orthodox subjects of the empire. Those appointed to the role were chosen by the Muslims rulers not the Church.\n\nAs a result of the Ottoman conquest, the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became suddenly isolated from the West. For the next four hundred years, it was confined within the Islamic world, with which it had little in common religiously or culturally. The Orthodox Churches from [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] states, [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]] were the only part of the Orthodox communion that remained outside the control of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n[[File:Stavronikita Aug2006.jpg|thumb|330px|right|Stavronikita monastery, South-East view]]\n\n===Isolation from the West===\nAs a result of the Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, and the [[Fall of Constantinople]], the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became suddenly isolated from the West. For the next four hundred years, it was confined within a hostile Islamic world, with which it had little in common religiously or culturally. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was the only part of the Orthodox communion which remained outside the control of the Ottoman Empire. It is, in part, due to this geographical and intellectual confinement that the voice of Eastern Orthodoxy was not heard during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th-century Europe. As a result, this important theological debate often seems strange and distorted to the Orthodox. They never took part in it and thus neither Reformation nor [[Counter-Reformation]] is part of their theological framework.\n\n===Religious rights under the Ottoman Empire===\n{{Further|Islam and anti-Christian persecution}}\n[[Islam]] recognized [[Jesus]] as a great prophet and considered Christians as another [[People of the Book]]. But it imposed severe penalties including frequent deaths for non Muslims. As such, the Church was not extinguished nor was its canonical and hierarchical organization completely destroyed. Its administration continued to function though in lesser degree, no longer being the state religion. One of the first things that [[Mehmed II|Mehmet the Conqueror]] did was to allow the Church to elect a new patriarch, [[Gennadius Scholarius]]. The [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Parthenon]], which had been Christian churches for nearly a millennium, were converted into mosques, yet most other churches, both in Constantinople and elsewhere, remained in Christian hands. Because [[Sharia|Islamic law]] makes no distinction between nationality and religion, all Christians, regardless of their language or nationality, were considered a single [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]], or nation. The patriarch, as the highest ranking hierarch, was thus invested with civil and religious authority and made [[ethnarch]], head of the entire Christian Orthodox population. Practically, this meant that all Orthodox Churches within Ottoman territory were under the control of Constantinople. Thus, the authority and jurisdictional frontiers of the patriarch were enormously enlarged.\n\nHowever, these [[Dhimmitude|rights and privileges]], including freedom of worship and religious organisation, were often established in principle but seldom corresponded to reality. The legal privileges of the patriarch and the Church depended, in fact, on the whim and mercy of the [[Sultan]] and the [[Sublime Porte]], while all Christians were viewed as second-class citizens. Moreover, Turkish corruption and brutality were not a myth. That it was the \"infidel\" Christian who experienced this more than anyone else is not in doubt. Nor were pogroms of Christians in these centuries unknown (see [[Greco-Turkish relations]]).<ref name=AIHG-NYT>[http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm The Australian Institute for Holocaust and Genocide Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607184704/http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm |date=2007-06-07 }} ''The New York Times''.</ref><ref>http://www.helleniccomserve.com/pdf/BlkBkPontusPrinceton.pdf</ref> Devastating, too, for the Church was the fact that it could not bear witness to Christ. Missionary work among Muslims was dangerous and indeed impossible, whereas conversion to Islam was entirely legal and permissible. Converts to Islam who returned to Orthodoxy were put to death as apostates. No new churches could be built, and even the ringing of church bells was prohibited. Education of the clergy and the Christian population either ceased altogether or was reduced to the most rudimentary elements.\n\n===Corruption===\nThe Orthodox Church found itself subject to the Turkish system of corruption. The patriarchal throne was frequently sold to the highest bidder, while new patriarchal investiture was accompanied by heavy payment to the government. In order to recoup their losses, patriarchs and bishops taxed the local parishes and their clergy. The patriarchal throne was never secure. Few patriarchs between the 15th and the 19th centuries died a natural death while in office. The forced abdications, exiles, hangings, drownings, and poisonings of patriarchs are well documented. But if the patriarch's position was precarious so was the hierarchy's.\n\n===Devshirmeh===\n[[Devshirmeh]] was the system of the collection of young boys from conquered Christian lands by the Ottoman sultans as a form of regular taxation in order to build a loyal  army (formerly largely composed of war captives) and the class of (military) administrators called the \"[[Janissary|Janissaries]]\", or other servants such as tellak in hamams. The word ''dev\u015firme'' means \"collecting, gathering\" in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. Boys delivered to the Ottomans in this way were called ''[[ghilm\u00e1n]]'' or ''acemi oglanlar'' (\"novice boys\").\n\n===Antioch===\nThe Church of Antioch was moved to [[Damascus]] in response to the Ottoman invasion of Antioch. Its traditional territory includes Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and parts of Turkey. The remainder of the Church of Antioch, primarily local Greeks or Hellenized sections of the indigenous population, remained in communion with Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, and Jerusalem\n\n==Western Christianity==\n\n===Western Schism ===\n{{Main|Western Schism}}\n\nIn 1409, a council was convened at [[Pisa]] to resolve the issue. The council declared both existing popes to be schismatic ([[Gregory XII]] from Rome; [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] from Avignon) and appointed a new one, [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]]. But the existing popes refused to resign, and thus there were three papal claimants. Another council was convened in 1414, the [[Council of Constance]]. In March 1415 the Pisan pope, [[John XXIII]], fled from Constance in disguise; he was brought back a prisoner and deposed in May. The Roman pope, Gregory XII, resigned voluntarily in July. The Avignon pope, Benedict XIII, refused to come to Constance; nor would he consider resignation. The council finally deposed him in July 1417. The council in Constance, having finally cleared the field of popes and antipopes, elected [[Pope Martin V]] as pope in November.\n\n=== Italian Renaissance (1399\u20131599) ===\n[[File:Michelangelo's Pieta 5450 cropncleaned.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Michelangelo's ''Piet\u00e0'' in St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City]]\nThe [[Italian Renaissance]] was a period of great cultural change and achievement, marked in Italy by a classical orientation and an increase of wealth through mercantile trade. The city of Rome, the Papacy, and the Papal States were all affected by the Renaissance. On the one hand, it was a time of great artistic patronage and architectural magnificence, where the Church supported such artists as [[Michelangelo]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], [[Raphael]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Donatello]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. On the other hand, wealthy Italian families often secured episcopal offices, including the papacy, for their own members, some of whom were known for immorality, such as [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] and [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]].\n\n===Scholasticism===\nScholastic theology continued to develop as the 13th century gave way to the fourteenth, becoming ever more complex and subtle in its distinctions and arguments.  The 14th century saw in particular the rise to dominance of the [[nominalism|nominalist]] or [[voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarist]] theologies of men like [[William of Ockham]].  The 14th century was also a time in which movements of widely varying character worked for the reform of the institutional church, such as [[conciliarism]], [[Lollardy]] and the [[Hussite]]s.  Spiritual movements such as the [[Devotio Moderna]] also flourished.\n\nNotable authors include:\n[[File:Hus na kazatelne.jpg|thumb|right|160pf|Jan Hus preaching, illumination from a Czech manuscript, 1490s]]\n* [[Jan Hus]] (c.1369\u20131415)\n* [[Pierre d'Ailly]] (1351\u20131420)\n* [[Jean Gerson]] (1363\u20131429)\n* [[Nicholas of Clemanges]] (1360\u20131440)\n* [[Nicholas of Cusa]] (1401\u20131464)\n* [[Thomas a Kempis]] (1380\u20131471)\n* [[Denis the Carthusian]] (1402\u20131471)\n* [[Rudolf Agricola]] (1444\u20131485)\n* [[Wessel Gansfort]] (1419\u20131489)\n* [[Gabriel Biel]] (1425\u20131495)\n* [[Johann Heynlin]] (1425\u20131496) \n* [[Girolamo Savonarola]] (1452\u20131498)\n* [[Jan Standonck]] (1454\u20131504)\n* [[Conrad Celtis]] (1459\u20131508)\n* [[Johann Geiler]] (1445\u20131510)\n* [[John Colet]] (1467\u20131519)\n* [[Johann Reuchlin]] (1455\u20131522)\n* [[Ulrich von Hutten]] (1488\u20131523)\n* [[Johann von Staupitz]] (1460\u20131524)\n* [[Jacob Wimpfeling]] (1450\u20131528)\n* [[Jacques Lefevre d'Etaples]] (1455\u20131536)\n* [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (1466\u20131536)\n\n===Protestant Reformation roots and precursors===\n{{see also|Bohemian Reformation}}\n[[Image: Jagie\u0142\u0142o dispute.JPG|right|thumb|Hussite theologians dispute in the presence of King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] of Poland]]\nThe Council of Constance confirmed strengthened the traditional medieval conception of Churches and Empires. It did not address the national tensions or the theological tensions which had been stirred up during the previous century. The council could not prevent [[Schism (religion)|schisms]] and the [[Hussite Wars]] in [[Bohemia]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hussites |volume=14 |pages=7\u20139 |first=Franti\u0161ek |last=L\u00fctzow }}</ref>\n\nHistorical upheaval usually yields much new thinking as to how society should be organized. This was the case leading up to the Protestant Reformation. Following the breakdown of monastic institutions and [[scholasticism]] in late medieval Europe, accentuated by the \"Babylonian Captivity\" of the Avignon Papacy, the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]], and the failure of the [[Conciliar movement]], the 16th century saw the fomenting of a great cultural debate about religious reforms and later fundamental religious values. Historians would generally assume that the failure to reform (too many vested interests, lack of coordination in the reforming coalition) would eventually lead to a greater upheaval or even revolution since the system must eventually be adjusted or disintegrate, and the failure of the Conciliar movement helped lead to the [[Protestant Reformation]] in Europe. These frustrated reformist movements ranged from [[nominalism]], [[Devotio Moderna|devotio moderna (modern devotion)]], to [[humanism]] occurring in conjunction with economic, political and demographic forces that contributed to a growing disaffection with the wealth and power of the elite [[clergy]], sensitizing the population to the financial and moral corruption of the secular [[Renaissance]] church.\n\nThe outcome of the [[Black Death]] encouraged a radical reorganization of the economy and eventually of European society. In the emerging urban centers, however, the calamities of the 14th and early 15th century, and the resultant labor shortages, provided a strong impetus for economic diversification and technological innovations. Following the Black Death, the initial loss of life from famine, plague, and pestilence contributed to an intensification of [[capital accumulation]] in the urban areas and thus a stimulus to trade, industry, and burgeoning urban growth in fields as diverse as banking (the [[Fugger]] banking family in [[Augsburg]] and the [[Medici]] family of [[Florence]] being the most prominent); textiles, [[Weapon|armaments]], especially stimulated by the [[Hundred Years' War]], and mining of iron ore with the booming armaments industry. Accumulation of surplus, competitive [[overproduction]], and heightened competition to maximize economic advantage contributed to civil war, aggressive [[militarism]], and thus to centralization. As a direct result of the move toward centralization, leaders like [[Louis XI of France]] sought to remove all constitutional restrictions on the exercise of their authority. In [[England]], [[France]], and [[Spain]] the move toward centralization begun in the 13th century was carried to a successful conclusion.\n\nBut as recovery and prosperity progressed, enabling the population to reach its former levels in the late 15th and 16th centuries, the combination of both a newly-abundant labor supply as well as improved productivity, were 'mixed blessings' for many segments of Western European society. Despite tradition, landlords started the move to exclude [[peasant]]s from \"[[common land]]s\". With trade stimulated, landowners increasingly moved away from the [[Manorialism|manorial]] economy. Woolen manufacturing greatly expanded in [[France]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]] and new textile industries began to develop.\n\nThe invention of [[movable type]] leads to the Protestant zeal for translating the Bible and getting it into the hands of the laity.  This would advance the culture of Biblical literacy.\n\nThe \"humanism\" of the [[Renaissance]] period stimulated unprecedented academic ferment, and a concern for [[academic freedom]]. Ongoing, earnest theoretical debates occurred in the universities about the nature of the church, and the source and extent of the authority of the papacy, of councils, and of princes.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Gonz\u00e1lez | first = Justo L.\n | title = The Story of Christianity: Vol. 1: The Early Church to the Reformation\n | url = https://archive.org/details/storyofchristian01gonz | url-access = registration | location = San Francisco\n | publisher = Harper\n | year = 1984\n | isbn = 0-06-063315-8\n }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Latourette\n | first = Kenneth Scott\n | authorlink = Kenneth Scott Latourette\n | title = A History of Christianity, Volume 1: Beginnings to 1500 (Revised)\n | year = 1975\n | location = San Francisco\n | publisher = Harper\n | isbn = 0-06-064952-6\n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/historyofchristi01lato\n }}</ref>\n\n==Spread of Christianity==\nThrough the late 15th and early 16th centuries, European missionaries and explorers spread Catholicism to the [[Americas]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Oceania]].
