Levels  of other neurotransmitters [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[somatostatin]] are also often reduced. Replenishing the ACh by anti-cholinesterases is an approved mode of treatment by FDA. An alternative method of stimulating ACh receptors of M1-M3 types by synthetic agonists that have a slower rate of dissociation from the receptor has been proposed as next generation cholinomimetic in Alzheimer's disease<sup>[15]</sup>.\n\n==Disease mechanism==\nAlthough the gross histological features of AD in the brain are well characterized, three major hypotheses have been advanced regarding the primary cause. The oldest hypothesis suggests that deficiency in [[cholinergic]] signaling initiates the progression of the disease. Two alternative misfolding hypotheses instead suggest that either tau protein or amyloid beta initiates the cascade. While researchers have not identified a clear causative pathway originating from any of the three molecular hypotheses to explain the gross anatomical changes observed in advanced AD, variants of the amyloid beta hypothesis of molecular initiation have become dominant among the three possibilities.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Cholinergic hypothesis===\n\nThe oldest hypothesis is the \"cholinergic hypothesis\". It states that Alzheimer's begins as a deficiency in the production of [[acetylcholine]], a vital [[neurotransmitter]]. Much early therapeutic research was based on this hypothesis, including restoration of the \"cholinergic nuclei\". The possibility of cell-replacement therapy was investigated on the basis of this hypothesis. All of the first-generation anti-Alzheimer's medications are based on this hypothesis and work to preserve acetylcholine by inhibiting [[acetylcholinesterase]]s (enzymes that break down acetylcholine). These medications, though sometimes beneficial, have not led to a cure. In all cases, they have served to only treat symptoms of the disease and have neither halted nor reversed it. These results and other research have led to the conclusion that acetylcholine deficiencies may not be directly causal, but are a result of widespread brain tissue damage, damage so widespread that cell-replacement therapies are likely to be impractical.\n\nMore recent hypotheses center on the effects of the misfolded and aggregated proteins, amyloid beta and tau. The two positions are lightheartedly described as \"ba-ptist\" and \"tau-ist\" viewpoints in one scientific publication. Therein, it is suggested that \"Tau-ists\" believe that the [[tau protein]] abnormalities initiate the disease cascade, while \"ba-ptists\" believe that [[beta amyloid]] deposits are the causative factor in the disease.<ref name=\"Mudher\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mudher A, Lovestone S |title=Alzheimer's disease-do tauists and baptists finally shake hands? |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=22\u20136 |year=2002 |pmid=11801334 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(00)02031-2}}</ref>\n\n===Tau hypothesis===\n\nThe hypothesis that tau is the primary causative factor has long been grounded in the observation that deposition of amyloid plaques does not correlate well with neuron loss.<ref name=\"Schmitz\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmitz C, Rutten BP, Pielen A |title=Hippocampal neuron loss exceeds amyloid plaque load in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease |journal=Am.

It was concluded that dysfunction of cell and synaptic adhesion is central to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and mutational instability of large synaptic adhesion genes may be the etiological trigger of neurotransmission disruption and synaptic loss in brain aging. As a typical example, this hypothesis explains the APOE risk locus of AD in context of signaling of its giant lipoprotein receptor, LRP1b which is a large tumor-suppressor gene with brain-specific expression and also maps to an unstable chromosomal fragile site.

The oldest hypothesis suggests that deficiency in [[cholinergic]] signaling initiates the progression of the disease. Two alternative misfolding hypotheses instead suggest that either tau protein or amyloid beta initiates the cascade. While researchers have not identified a clear causative pathway originating from any of the three molecular hypotheses to explain the gross anatomical changes observed in advanced AD, variants of the amyloid beta hypothesis of molecular initiation have become dominant among the three possibilities.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Cholinergic hypothesis===\n\nThe oldest hypothesis is the \"cholinergic hypothesis\". It states that Alzheimer's begins as a deficiency in the production of [[acetylcholine]], a vital [[neurotransmitter]]. Much early therapeutic research was based on this hypothesis, including restoration of the \"cholinergic nuclei\". The possibility of cell-replacement therapy was investigated on the basis of this hypothesis. All of the first-generation anti-Alzheimer's medications are based on this hypothesis and work to preserve acetylcholine by inhibiting [[acetylcholinesterase]]s (enzymes that break down acetylcholine). These medications, though sometimes beneficial, have not led to a cure. In all cases, they have served to only treat symptoms of the disease and have neither halted nor reversed it. These results and other research have led to the conclusion that acetylcholine deficiencies may not be directly causal, but are a result of widespread brain tissue damage, damage so widespread that cell-replacement therapies are likely to be impractical.\n\nMore recent hypotheses center on the effects of the misfolded and aggregated proteins, amyloid beta and tau. The two positions are lightheartedly described as \"ba-ptist\" and \"tau-ist\" viewpoints in one scientific publication. Therein, it is suggested that \"Tau-ists\" believe that the [[tau protein]] abnormalities initiate the disease cascade, while \"ba-ptists\" believe that [[beta amyloid]] deposits are the causative factor in the disease.<ref name=\"Mudher\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mudher A, Lovestone S |title=Alzheimer's disease-do tauists and baptists finally shake hands? |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=22\u20136 |year=2002 |pmid=11801334 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(00)02031-2}}</ref>\n\n===Tau hypothesis===\n\nThe hypothesis that tau is the primary causative factor has long been grounded in the observation that deposition of amyloid plaques does not correlate well with neuron loss.<ref name=\"Schmitz\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schmitz C, Rutten BP, Pielen A |title=Hippocampal neuron loss exceeds amyloid plaque load in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease |journal=Am.

It was concluded that dysfunction of cell and synaptic adhesion is central to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and mutational instability of large synaptic adhesion genes may be the etiological trigger of neurotransmission disruption and synaptic loss in brain aging. As a typical example, this hypothesis explains the APOE risk locus of AD in context of signaling of its giant lipoprotein receptor, LRP1b which is a large tumor-suppressor gene with brain-specific expression and also maps to an unstable chromosomal fragile site. The large gene instability hypothesis puts the DNA damage mechanism at the center of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Biochemistry Of Alzheimer's Disease}}\n[[Category:Alzheimer's disease]]\n[[Category:Neurology]]\n[[Category:Unsolved problems in neuroscience]]\n[[Category:Pathology]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry_of_Alzheimer%27s_disease"}

The company, which was founded in 2005, is headquartered in [[Mountain View, California]] and also has offices in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]], China, [[Uttar Pradesh]], India and [[Barcelona]], Spain.\n\n==History==\n\nThe original flagship product of TVU Networks was TVUPlayer. TVUPlayer was [[freeware]] [[IPTV]] software application for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS|Mac OS X]] to watch several dozen TV channels over the Internet. TVU did not broadcast these channels, but provided a platform for broadcasters to distribute content online. It was the responsibility of the individual who broadcasts a particular channel on TVU to keep the channel running and ensure that the content can be legally transmitted. It was unknown to the viewer who the broadcaster was. Broadcasts originated from either a large broadcasting company itself, which chose to provide viewers with its broadcast, or individual broadcasters who created their own content or captured public broadcasts and rebroadcast them on TVU.\n\nIt was debated whether TVU Networks operated an illegal service by  knowingly providing users with an opportunity to watch copyrighted content without the permission of content owners. However, the company did not provide the illegal content itself due the fact that was the responsibility of the user who provided the content to verify its legality.<ref name=\"cnet1\">{{Cite news |url= http://news.cnet.com/TVU+Networks+exec+grapples+with+copyright+questions/2100-1026_3-6132672.html |title= TVU chief grapples with copyright questions |work= CNET News |accessdate= November 27, 2013 |author= Greg Sandoval |date= November 6, 2006 |archiveurl= https://archive.today/20130119174026/http://news.cnet.com/TVU-Networks-exec-grapples-with-copyright-questions/2100-1026_3-6132672.html |archivedate= January 19, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=  }}</ref>\n\nTVU Networks shut down service to the TVUPlayer on February 25, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web |title= TVU Networks shut down service to the TVU Player on February 25, 2013. |work= Company web site |url= http://www.tvunetworks.com/faq.html |accessdate= November 27, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203015357/http://www.tvunetworks.com/faq.html |archivedate= December 3, 2013 |df=  }}</ref>\n\n==Products==\n\n===TVU Alert===\n\nTVU Alert is a cloud-based service that allows users to instantly notify their entire organization or part of their organization about important information.\nvvvv\n\n===TVU Anywhere===\n\nTVU Anywhere is an app that turns mobile devices or laptops into transmitters that use aggregated cellular and WiFi connections to stream high-quality video.\n\n===TVU AP ENPS Integration===\n\nTVU AP ENPS Integration is a collaboration between TVU Networks and the Associated Press to create a newsroom workflow geared toward streamlining the newsgathering process from shooting to editing.\n\n===TVU Aerial Newsgathering Pack===\nThe TVU Aerial Newsgathering Pack integrates its TVU One mobile transmitter with drone technology to enable live high-definition transmission from in the air.\n\n===TVU Booking Service===\nTVU Booking Service lets stations plan and manage streams.

The company, which was founded in 2005, is headquartered in [[Mountain View, California]] and also has offices in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]], China, [[Uttar Pradesh]], India and [[Barcelona]], Spain.\n\n==Company==\n\nTVU Networks offers IP-based solutions for live broadcast. Its solutions are deployed across a variety of industries including news broadcast, web streaming, law enforcement, sports and government. TVU Networks\u2019 products have been used to cover a number of events around the world including the Royal Wedding, the World Cup, the London Summer Olympics and Sochi Winter Olympics, and U.S. presidential elections.\n\n==History==\n\nThe original flagship product of TVU Networks was TVUPlayer. TVUPlayer was [[freeware]] [[IPTV]] software application for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS|Mac OS X]] to watch several dozen TV channels over the Internet. TVU did not broadcast these channels, but provided a platform for broadcasters to distribute content online. It was the responsibility of the individual who broadcasts a particular channel on TVU to keep the channel running and ensure that the content can be legally transmitted. It was unknown to the viewer who the broadcaster was. Broadcasts originated from either a large broadcasting company itself, which chose to provide viewers with its broadcast, or individual broadcasters who created their own content or captured public broadcasts and rebroadcast them on TVU.\n\nIt was debated whether TVU Networks operated an illegal service by  knowingly providing users with an opportunity to watch copyrighted content without the permission of content owners. However, the company did not provide the illegal content itself due the fact that was the responsibility of the user who provided the content to verify its legality.<ref name=\"cnet1\">{{Cite news |url= http://news.cnet.com/TVU+Networks+exec+grapples+with+copyright+questions/2100-1026_3-6132672.html |title= TVU chief grapples with copyright questions |work= CNET News |accessdate= November 27, 2013 |author= Greg Sandoval |date= November 6, 2006 |archiveurl= https://archive.today/20130119174026/http://news.cnet.com/TVU-Networks-exec-grapples-with-copyright-questions/2100-1026_3-6132672.html |archivedate= January 19, 2013 |url-status=dead |df=  }}</ref>\n\nTVU Networks shut down service to the TVUPlayer on February 25, 2013.<ref>{{Cite web |title= TVU Networks shut down service to the TVU Player on February 25, 2013. |work= Company web site |url= http://www.tvunetworks.com/faq.html |accessdate= November 27, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131203015357/http://www.tvunetworks.com/faq.html |archivedate= December 3, 2013 |df=  }}</ref>\n\n==Products==\n\n===TVU Alert===\n\nTVU Alert is a cloud-based service that allows users to instantly notify their entire organization or part of their organization about important information.\n\n===TVU Anywhere===\n\nTVU Anywhere is an app that turns mobile devices or laptops into transmitters that use aggregated cellular and WiFi connections to stream high-quality video.\n\n===TVU AP ENPS Integration===\n\nTVU AP ENPS Integration is a collaboration between TVU Networks and the Associated Press to create a newsroom workflow geared toward streamlining the newsgathering process from shooting to editing.\n\n===TVU Aerial Newsgathering Pack===\nThe TVU Aerial Newsgathering Pack integrates its TVU One mobile transmitter with drone technology to enable live high-definition transmission from in the air.\n\n===TVU Booking Service===\nTVU Booking Service lets stations plan and manage streams.
