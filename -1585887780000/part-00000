{"title_page": "Demiurge", "text_new": "{{short description|An artisan-like figure responsible for fashioning and maintaining the physical universe}}\n{{about|philosophical concept of a Universal Fashioner|other uses|Demiurge (disambiguation)}}\n{{God| expanded=representations}}\n{{platonism}}\nIn the [[Platonism|Platonic]], [[Neopythagorean]], [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonic]], and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] schools of philosophy, the '''demiurge''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d|\u025b|m|i|.|\u025cr|d\u0292}}) is an [[artisan]]-like figure responsible for fashioning and maintaining the physical universe. The [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] adopted the term \"demiurge\". Although a fashioner, the demiurge is not necessarily the same as the creator figure in the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] sense, because the demiurge itself and the material from which the demiurge fashions the universe are both considered to be consequences of something else. Depending on the system, they may be considered to be either uncreated and eternal or the product of some other entity.\n\nThe word \"demiurge\" is an English word derived from ''demiurgus'', a [[List of Latinised names|Latinised]] form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2}} or ''d\u0113miurg\u00f3s''. It was originally a common noun meaning \"craftsman\" or \"artisan,\" but gradually came to mean \"producer,\" and eventually \"creator.\" The philosophical usage and the proper noun derive from [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Plato's ''Timaeus'']], written {{circa}}&nbsp;360 BC, where the demiurge is presented as the creator of the universe. The demiurge is also described as a creator in the Platonic ({{circa}}&nbsp;310\u201390 BC) and Middle Platonic ({{circa}}&nbsp;90 BC-AD 300) philosophical traditions. In the various branches of the Neoplatonic school (third century onwards), the demiurge is the fashioner of the real, perceptible world after the model of the [[Theory of Forms|<!-- capitalized-->Ideas]], but (in most Neoplatonic systems) is still not itself \"[[Form of the Good|the One]].\" In the arch-[[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]] ideology of the various Gnostic systems, the material universe is evil, while the non-material world is good. According to some strains of Gnosticism, the demiurge is [[Evil|malevolent]], as it is linked to the material world. In others, including the teaching of [[Valentinianism|Valentinus]], the demiurge is simply ignorant or misguided.\n\n==Platonism and neoplatonism==\n[[Plato]], as the speaker Timaeus, refers to the Demiurge frequently in the [[Socratic dialogue]] ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (28a [[wikt:ff.#Abbreviation|ff.]]), {{circa}}&nbsp;360 BC. The main character refers to the Demiurge as the entity who \"fashioned and shaped\" the material world. Timaeus describes the Demiurge as unreservedly [[:wikt:benevolence|benevolent]], and so it desires a world as good as possible. Plato's work ''Timaeus'' is a philosophical reconciliation of [[Hesiod]]'s cosmology in his ''[[Theogony]]'', [[syncretism|syncretically]] reconciling Hesiod to [[Homer]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Python: A Study of Delphic Myth and Its Origin|year=1974|first=Joseph|last=Fontenrose|page=226|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h56ansk4SyQC&pg=PA226 | isbn=978-0-8196-0285-5 | publisher=Biblo & Tannen Publishers}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Chorology: On Beginning in Plato's Timaeus|year=1999|first=John|last=Sallis|page=86|isbn=0-253-21308-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gS_9aQ5mYKgC&pg=PA86 | publisher=Indiana University Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The mythology of ancient Greece and Italy|first=Thomas|last=Keightley|year=1838|page=[https://archive.org/details/mythologyancien04keiggoog/page/n90 44]|publisher=Oxford University|url=https://archive.org/details/mythologyancien04keiggoog|quote=theogony timaeus.}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Platonism===\nIn [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]]'s [[Neo-Pythagorean]] and Middle Platonist [[cosmogony]], the Demiurge is second God as the ''[[nous]]'' or thought of intelligibles and sensibles.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans|last=Kahn|first=Charles|publisher=Hacket Publishing|year=|isbn=978-0-872205758|location=Indianapolis|pages=124}}</ref>\n\n===Neoplatonism===\n[[Plotinus]] and the later Platonists worked to clarify the Demiurge. To Plotinus, the second [[Emanationism|emanation]] represents an uncreated second cause (see [[Pythagoras]]' [[Dyad (symbol)|Dyad]]). Plotinus sought to reconcile Aristotle's ''[[energeia]]'' with Plato's Demiurge,<ref name=\"Karamanolis2006\">{{cite book|last=Karamanolis|first=George|year= 2006|title=Plato and Aristotle in Agreement?: Platonists on Aristotle from Antiochus to Porphyry|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-926456-2|page=240}}</ref> which, as Demiurge and mind (''nous''), is a critical component in the [[ontological]] construct of human consciousness used to explain and clarify [[substance theory]] within [[Platonic realism]] (also called [[idealism]]).

The second principle is organization in its reflection of the [[Sentience|nonsentient]] force or ''[[Potentiality and actuality|dynamis]]'', also called the one or the Monad. The dyad is ''energeia'' emanated by the one that is then the work, process or activity called ''nous'', Demiurge, mind, consciousness that organizes the indeterminate vitality into the experience called the material world, universe, cosmos. [[Plotinus]] also elucidates the equation of matter with nothing or non-being in ''[[The Enneads]]''<ref>\"Matter is therefore a non-existent\"; Plotinus, ''Ennead'' 2, Tractate 4 Section 16.</ref> which more correctly is to express the concept of [[idealism]] or that there is not anything or anywhere outside of the \"mind\" or ''nous'' (c.f. [[pantheism]]).\n\nPlotinus' form of [[Platonic idealism]] is to treat the Demiurge, ''nous'' as the contemplative faculty (''ergon'') within man which orders the force (''dynamis'') into conscious reality.<ref>[[Schopenhauer]] wrote of this Neoplatonist philosopher: \"With Plotinus there even appears, probably for the first time in [[Western philosophy]], idealism that had long been current in the East even at that time, for it taught (Enneads, iii, lib. vii, c.10) that the soul has made the world by stepping from eternity into time, with the explanation: 'For there is for this universe no other place than the soul or mind' (''neque est alter hujus universi locus quam anima''), indeed the ideality of time is expressed in the words: 'We should not accept time outside the soul or mind' (''oportet autem nequaquam extra animam tempus accipere'').\" (Parerga and Paralipomena, Volume I, \"Fragments for the History of Philosophy,\" \u00a7&nbsp;7) Similarly, Professor Ludwig Noir\u00e9 wrote: \"For the first time in Western philosophy we find idealism proper in Plotinus (Enneads, iii, 7, 10), where he says, 'The only space or place of the world is the soul,' and 'Time must not be assumed to exist outside the soul.'\" [5] It is worth noting, however, that like Plato but unlike Schopenhauer and other modern philosophers, Plotinus does not worry about whether or how we can get beyond our ideas to know external objects.</ref> In this, he claimed to reveal Plato's true meaning: a doctrine he learned from Platonic tradition that did not appear outside the academy or in Plato's text. This tradition of creator God as ''nous'' (the manifestation of consciousness), can be validated in the works of pre-Plotinus philosophers such as [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], as well as a connection between Hebrew and Platonic cosmology (see also [[Philo]]).<ref>[[Numenius of Apamea]] was reported to have asked, \"What else is Plato than Moses speaking Greek?\" Fr. 8 Des Places.</ref>\n\nThe Demiurge of Neoplatonism is the ''Nous'' (mind of God), and is one of the three ordering principles:\n* ''[[Arche]]'' (Gr. \"beginning\") \u2013 the source of all things,\n* ''[[Logos]]'' (Gr. \"reason/cause\") \u2013 the underlying order that is hidden beneath appearances,\n* ''[[:wikt:harmonia|Harmonia]]'' (Gr. \"harmony\") \u2013 numerical [[ratios]] in [[mathematics]].\n\nBefore Numenius of Apamea and Plotinus' ''[[Enneads]]'', no Platonic works ontologically clarified the Demiurge from the [[allegory]] in Plato's ''Timaeus''. The idea of Demiurge was, however, addressed before Plotinus in the works of Christian writer [[Justin Martyr]] who built his understanding of the Demiurge on the works of Numenius.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n====Iamblichus====\n{{See also|Panentheism}}\nLater, the Neoplatonist [[Iamblichus of Chalcis|Iamblichus]] changed the role of the \"One,\" effectively altering the role of the Demiurge as second cause or dyad, which was one of the reasons that Iamblichus and his teacher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] came into conflict.\n\nThe figure of the Demiurge emerges in the theoretic of Iamblichus, which conjoins the transcendent, incommunicable \u201cOne,\u201d or Source. Here, at the summit of this system, the Source and Demiurge (material realm) coexist via the process of ''[[henosis]]''.<ref>See [http://www.theandros.com/iamblichus.html Theurgy, Iamblichus and henosis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109100359/http://www.theandros.com/iamblichus.html |date=2010-01-09 }}.</ref>\nIamblichus describes the One as a monad whose first principle or emanation is intellect (''nous''), while among \"the many\" that follow it there is a second, super-existent \"One\" that is the producer of intellect or soul (''psyche'').\n\nThe \"One\" is further separated into spheres of intelligence; the first and superior sphere is objects of thought, while the latter sphere is the domain of thought. Thus, a [[wikt:triad#Noun|triad]] is formed of the [[perception|intelligible]] ''nous'', the [[noesis|intellective]] ''nous'', and the ''[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'' in order to reconcile further the various Hellenistic philosophical schools of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Actus et potentia|''actus'' and ''potentia'']] (actuality and potentiality) of the [[unmoved mover]] and Plato's Demiurge.\n\nThen within this intellectual triad Iamblichus assigns the third rank to the Demiurge, identifying it with the perfect or Divine ''nous'' with the intellectual triad being promoted to a ''hebdomad'' (pure intellect).\n\nIn the theoretic of Plotinus, ''nous'' produces nature through intellectual mediation, thus the intellectualizing gods are followed by a triad of psychic gods.\n\n==Gnosticism==\n{{Split section |Yaldabaoth|discuss={{TALKPAGENAME}}#Split proposed |date=November 2018}}\n{{gnosticism}}\n[[Gnosticism]] presents a distinction between the highest, unknowable God or [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Supreme Being]] and the demiurgic \"creator\" of the material. Several systems of Gnostic thought present the Demiurge as antagonistic to the will of the Supreme Being: his act of creation occurs in an unconscious semblance of the divine model, and thus is fundamentally flawed, or else is formed with the malevolent intention of entrapping aspects of the divine ''in'' materiality. Thus, in such systems, the Demiurge acts as a solution to (or, at least possibly, the problem or cause that gives rise to){{citation needed|date=March 2014}} the [[problem of evil]].\n\n===Mythos===\nOne Gnostic [[mythos]] describes the declination of aspects of the divine into human form. [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] (Greek: \u03a3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1, lit. \"wisdom\"), the Demiurge's mother and partial aspect of the divine ''[[Pleroma]]'' or \"Fullness,\" desired to create something apart from the [[Absolute (philosophy)|divine totality]], without the receipt of divine assent. In this act of separate creation, she gave birth to the monstrous Demiurge and, being ashamed of her deed, wrapped him in a cloud and created a throne for him within it. The Demiurge, isolated, did not behold his mother, nor anyone else, and concluded that only he existed, ignorant of the superior levels of reality.\n\nThe Demiurge, having received a portion of power from his mother, sets about a work of creation in unconscious imitation of the superior [[Pleroma|Pleromatic]] realm: He frames the [[seven heavens]], as well as all material and animal things, according to forms furnished by his mother; working, however, blindly and ignorant even of the existence of the mother who is the source of all his energy. He is blind to all that is spiritual, but he is king over the other two provinces. The word ''d\u0113miurgos'' properly describes his relation to the material; he is the ''father'' of that which is animal-like himself.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103105.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 5, 1.]</ref>\n\nThus Sophia's power becomes enclosed within the material forms of humanity, themselves entrapped within the material universe. In essence, the goal of Gnostic movements was typically the awakening of this spark, which permitted a return by the subject to the superior, non-material realities, which were its primal source.\n\n===Angels===\n[[Psalm 82]] begins ({{bibleref2|Psa|82:1|NET|verse 1}}), \"God stands in the assembly of [[El (deity)|El]] {{bracket|[[Septuagint|LXX]]: the assembly of gods}}, amid the gods he renders judgment,\" indicating a plurality of gods. However, it does not indicate that these gods were co-actors in creation. [[Philo]] had inferred from the expression \"Let us make man\" of the [[Book of Genesis]] that God had used other beings as assistants in the creation of man, and he explains in this way why man is capable of vice as well as virtue, ascribing the origin of the latter to God, of the former to His helpers in the work of creation.<ref>{{quote|It is on this account that Moses says, at the creation of man alone that God said, \"Let us make man,\" which expression shows an assumption of other beings to himself as assistants, so that God, the governor of all things, might have all the blameless intentions and actions of man when he does right attributed to him; and that his other assistants might bear the imputation of his contrary actions.|{{cite web |title=Philo: On the Creation, XXIV |url=http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book1.html |website=www.earlyjewishwritings.com}}}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest Gnostic sects ascribe the work of creation to angels, some of them using the same passage in Genesis.<ref>[[Justin Martyr]], ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. c. 67.</ref> So [[Irenaeus]] tells<ref>Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 23, 1.</ref> of the system of [[Simon Magus]],<ref>Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 23, 5.</ref> of the system of [[Menander (gnostic)|Menander]],<ref>Irenaeus, i. 24, 1.</ref> of the system of Saturninus, in which the number of these angels is reckoned as seven, and<ref>Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 25.</ref> of the system of [[Carpocrates]].

The prophecies are ascribed not to the chief but to the other world-making angels.\n\nThe Latin translation, confirmed by [[Hippolytus of Rome]],<ref>Hippolytus, ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]''. vii. 33.</ref> makes [[Irenaeus]] state that according to [[Cerinthus]] (who shows [[Ebionites|Ebionite]] influence), creation was made by a power quite separate from the Supreme God and ignorant of Him. [[Theodoret]],<ref>Theodoret, ''Haer. Fab''. ii. 3.</ref> who here copies Irenaeus, turns this into the plural number \"powers,\" and so [[Epiphanius of Salamis]]<ref>Epiphanius, ''[[Panarion]]'', 28.</ref> represents Cerinthus as agreeing with Carpocrates in the doctrine that angels made the world.\n\n===Yaldabaoth===\n[[File:Lion-faced deity.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A lion-faced deity found on a Gnostic gem in [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]'s ''L'antiquit\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e et repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en figures'' may be a depiction of the Demiurge.]]\n\nIn the [[Ophites|Ophite]] and [[Sethians|Sethian]] systems, which have many affinities with the teachings of Valentinus, the making of the world is ascribed to a company of seven [[archon (Gnosticism)|archons]], whose names are given, but still more prominent is their chief, \"Yaldabaoth\" (also known as \"Yaltabaoth\" or \"Ialdabaoth\").\n\nIn the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]'' {{circa}}&nbsp; AD 120\u2013180, the demiurge arrogantly declares that he has made the world by himself:\n<blockquote>\nNow the [[archon]] [\"ruler\"], who is weak, has three names. The first name is Yaltabaoth, the second is Saklas [\"fool\"], and the third is [[Samael]]. And he is impious in his arrogance, which is in him. For he said, 'I am God, and there is no other God beside me,' for he is ignorant of his strength, the place from which he had come.<ref>\"Apocryphon of John,\" translation by Frederik Wisse in ''The Nag Hammadi Library''. Accessed online at [http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/apocjn.html gnosis.org]</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe is Demiurge and maker of man, but as a ray of light from above enters the body of a man and gives him a soul, Yaldabaoth is filled with envy; he tries to limit man's knowledge by forbidding him the fruit of knowledge in paradise. At the consummation of all things, all light will return to the [[Pleroma]]. But Yaldabaoth, the Demiurge, with the material world, will be cast into the lower depths.<ref name=\"Catholic\">{{Catholic|wstitle=Demiurge|inline=yes}}</ref>\n\nYaldabaoth is frequently called \"the Lion-faced,\" ''leontoeides'', and is said to have the body of a serpent. The demiurge is also<ref>Hipp. ''Ref''. vi. 32, p.&nbsp;191.</ref> described as having a fiery nature, applying the words of Moses to him: \"the Lord our God is a burning and consuming fire.\" Hippolytus claims that Simon used a similar description.<ref>Hipp. ''Ref''. vi. 9.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Pistis Sophia]]'', Yaldabaoth has already sunk from his high estate and resides in Chaos, where, with his forty-nine demons, he tortures wicked souls in boiling rivers of the pitch, and with other punishments (pp.&nbsp;257, 382). He is an archon with the face of a lion, half flame, and half-darkness.\n\nUnder the name of ''Nebro'' (rebel), Yaldabaoth is called an angel in the [[apocryphal]] ''[[Gospel of Judas]]''. He is first mentioned in \"The Cosmos, Chaos, and the Underworld\" as one of the twelve angels to come \"into being [to] rule over chaos and the [underworld].\" He comes from heaven, and it is said his \"face flashed with fire and [his] appearance was defiled with blood.\" Nebro creates six angels in addition to the angel [[Saklas]] to be his assistants. These six, in turn, create another twelve angels \"with each one receiving a portion in the heavens.\"\n\n====Names====\n[[File:Leontocephaline-Ostia.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Drawing of the lion-headed figure found at the [[Mithraeum]] of C.&nbsp;Valerius Heracles and sons, dedicated 190&nbsp;CE at [[Ostia Antica]], Italy (CIMRM 312).]]\n\nThe most probable derivation of the name \"Yaldabaoth\" was given by [[Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler]]. Giesler believed the name was derived from the Aramaic ''yald\u0101 bahuth'', {{lang|arc|\u05d9\u05dc\u05d3\u05d0\u05d1\u05d4\u05d5\u05ea}}, meaning \"Son of Chaos.\" However, [[Gilles Quispel]] notes:\n{{quote|[[Gershom Scholem]], the third genius in this field, more specifically the genius of precision, had taught us that some of us were wrong when they believed that Jaldabaoth means \"son of chaos\" because the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''bahutha'' in the sense of chaos only existed in the imagination of the author of a well-known dictionary. This is a pity because this name would suit the demiurge risen from chaos to a nicety. And perhaps the author of the ''[[On the Origin of the World|Untitled Document]]'' did not know Aramaic and also supposed as we did once, that ''baoth'' had something to do with ''[[Tohu wa-bohu|tohuwabohu]]'', one of the few Hebrew words that everybody knows. ... It would seem then that the Orphic view of the demiurge was integrated into Jewish Gnosticism even before the redaction of the myth contained in the original ''[[Apocryphon of John]]''. ... [[Phanes]] is represented with the mask of a ''lion's'' head on his breast, while from his sides, the heads of a ram and a buck are budding forth: his body is encircled by a snake. This type was accepted by the [[Mithraism|Mithras mysteries]], to indicate [[Aion (deity)|Aion]], the new year, and Mithras, whose numerical value is 365. Sometimes he is also identified with Jao Adonai, the creator of the Hebrews. His hieratic attitude indicates Egyptian origin. The same is true of [[Mithraism#lion-headed figure|the monstrous figure with the head of a lion]], which symbolises Time, [[Chronos]], in Mithraism; Alexandrian origin of this type is probable.<ref>{{cite book |last=Quispel |first=Gilles |authorlink=Gilles Quispel |page=64 |title=Gnostica, Judaica, Catholica: Collected Essays of Gilles Quispel |editor1-first= Johannes |editor1-last=Van Oort |isbn=978-90-04-13945-9 |year=2008 |publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV |location=Leiden}}</ref>}}\n\n\"[[Samael]]\" literally means \"Blind God\" or \"God of the Blind\" in Hebrew ({{hebrew|\u05e1\u05de\u05d0\u05dc}}). This being is considered not only blind, or ignorant of its own origins but may, in addition, be evil; its name is also found in [[Judaism]] as the [[Death (personification)#Death (angels) in religion|Angel of Death]] and in Christian [[demon]]ology. This link to the Judeo-Christian tradition leads to a further comparison with [[Satan]]. Another alternative title for the demiurge is \"Saklas,\" Aramaic for \"fool.\"\n\nThe angelic name \"[[Ariel (angel)|Ariel]]\" (meaning \"the lion of God\" in Hebrew)<ref>{{cite book |title=Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition |first=Gershom |last=Scholem |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary of America |year=1965 |page=72}}</ref> has also been used to refer to the Demiurge and is called his \"perfect\" name;<ref>{{cite book |author=Robert McLachlan Wilson |title=Nag Hammadi and gnosis: Papers read at the First International Congress of Coptology |year=1976 |publisher=BRILL |pages=21\u201323 |quote=''Therefore his esoteric name is Jaldabaoth, whereas the perfect call him Ariel, because he has the appearance of a lion.''}}</ref> in some Gnostic lore, Ariel has been called an ancient or original name for Ialdabaoth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gustav Davidson|title=A dictionary of angels: including the fallen angels |year=1994 |publisher=Scrollhouse |page=54}}</ref> The name has also been inscribed on amulets as \"Ariel Ialdabaoth\",<ref>{{cite book|author=David M Gwynn|title=Religious Diversity in Late Antiquity |year=2010 |publisher=BRILL |page=448}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Campbell Bonner |title=An Amulet of the Ophite Gnostics |year=1949 |publisher=The American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Hesperia Supplements, Vol. 8|pages=43\u201346}}</ref> and the figure of the archon inscribed with \"Aariel\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=Gilles Quispel |author2=R. van den Broek |author-link2=Roel van den Broek |author3=Maarten Jozef Vermaseren |title=Studies in gnosticism and hellenistic religions |year=1981 |publisher=BRILL |pages=40\u201341}}</ref>\n\n===Marcion===\nAccording to [[Marcion of Sinope|Marcion]], the title God was given to the Demiurge, who was to be sharply distinguished from the higher Good God. The former was ''d\u00edkaios,'' severely just, the latter ''agath\u00f3s,'' or loving-kind; the former was the \"god of this world\" ({{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|4:4}}), the God of the [[Old Testament]], the latter the true God of the [[New Testament]]. Christ, though in reality, the Son of the Good God, pretended to be the Messiah of the Demiurge, the better to spread the truth concerning His heavenly Father. The true believer in Christ entered into God's kingdom; the unbeliever remained forever the slave of the Demiurge.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n===Valentinus===\nIt is in the [[Valentinianism|system of Valentinus]] that the name ''D\u0113miurgos'' is used, which occurs nowhere in Irenaeus except in connection with the Valentinian system; we may reasonably conclude that it was Valentinus who adopted from Platonism the use of this word. When it is employed by other Gnostics either, it is not used in a technical sense, or its use has been borrowed from Valentinus. But it is only the name that can be said to be specially Valentinian; the personage intended by it corresponds more or less closely with the Yaldabaoth of the Ophites, the [[Abraxas|great Archon]] of Basilides, the Elohim of [[Justin (gnostic)|Justinus]], etc.\n\nThe Valentinian theory elaborates that from Achamoth (''he k\u00e1t\u014d soph\u00eda'' or lower wisdom) three kinds of substance take their origin, the spiritual (''pneumatiko\u00ed''), the animal (''psychiko\u00ed'') and the material (''hyliko\u00ed''). The Demiurge belongs to the second kind, as he was the offspring of a union of Achamoth with the matter.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/><ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103105.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 5.]</ref> And as Achamoth herself was only the daughter of ''Soph\u00eda'' the last of the thirty Aeons, the Demiurge was distant by many emanations from the Propat\u00f4r, or Supreme God.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nIn creating this world out of Chaos, the Demiurge was unconsciously influenced for good; and the universe, to the surprise even of its Maker, became almost perfect. The Demiurge regretted even its slight imperfection, and as he thought himself the Supreme God, he attempted to remedy this by sending a Messiah.

The devil resides in this lower world, of which he is the prince, the Demiurge in the heavens; his mother Sophia in the middle region, above the heavens and below the Pleroma.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103105.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 5, 4.]</ref>\n\nThe Valentinian [[Heracleon]]<ref>[http://www.gnosis.org/library/fragh.htm Heracleon, Frag. 20.]</ref> interpreted the devil as the ''principle'' of evil, that of ''hyle'' (matter). As he writes in his commentary on {{bibleverse||John|4:21}},\n<blockquote>The mountain represents the Devil, or his world since the Devil was one part of the whole of matter, but the world is the total mountain of evil, a deserted dwelling place of beasts, to which all who lived before the law and all Gentiles render worship. But Jerusalem represents the creation of the Creator whom the Jews worship. ... You then who are spiritual should worship neither the creation nor the Craftsman, but the Father of Truth. </blockquote>\n\nThis vilification of the creator was held to be inimical to Christianity by the early fathers of the church. In refuting the beliefs of the gnostics, [[Irenaeus]] stated that \"Plato is proved to be more religious than these men, for he allowed that the same God was both just and good, having power over all things, and himself executing judgment.\"<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103325.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', iii. 25.]</ref>\n\n===Cathars===\n[[Catharism]] inherited their idea of Satan as the creator of the evil world from Gnosticism.

Thus their understanding of the Demiurge is similarly flawed in comparison to Plato\u2019s original intentions.\n\nWhereas Plato's Demiurge is good wishing good on his creation, Gnosticism contends that the Demiurge is not only the originator of evil but is evil as well. Hence the title of Plotinus' refutation: \"Against Those That Affirm the Creator of the Kosmos and the Kosmos Itself to be Evil\" (generally quoted as \"Against the Gnostics\"). Plotinus argues of the disconnect or great barrier that is created between the ''nous'' or the mind's [[noumenon]] (see [[Heraclitus]]) and the material world ([[phenomenon]]) by believing the material world is evil.\n\nThe majority of scholars tend<ref>{{cite book|title=Plotinus: Enneads II|edition=Loeb Classical Library|author=Plotinus, Arthur Hilary Armstrong (trans.)|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1966|quote=From this point to the end of ch. 12 Plotinus is attacking a Gnostic myth known to us best at present in the form it took in the system of Valentinus. The Mother, Sophia-Achamoth, produced as a result of the complicated sequence of events which followed the fall of the higher Sophia, and her offspring the Demiurge, the inferior and ignorant maker of the material universe, are Valentinian figures; cp. Irenaeus, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' 1.4 and 5. Valentinius had been in Rome, and there is nothing improbable in the presence of Valentinians there in the time of Plotinus. But the evidence in the ''Life'' ch. 16 suggests that the Gnostics in Plotinus's circle belonged rather to the older group called Sethians or [[Archontics]], related to the [[Ophites]] or [[Barbelo]]gnostics: they probably called themselves simply 'Gnostics.'

Plotinus specifically points to the Gnostic doctrine of Sophia and her emission of the Demiurge.\n\nThough the former understanding certainly enjoys the most significant popularity, the identification of Plotinus' opponents as Gnostic is not without some contention. Christos Evangeliou has contended<ref>Evangeliou, \"Plotinus's Anti-Gnostic Polemic and Porphyry's Against the Christians,\" in Wallis & Bregman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WSbrLPup7wYC&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=Plotinus%27s+Anti-Gnostic+Polemic+and+Porphyry%27s+Against+the+Christians%22+Christos+Evangeliou&source=bl&ots=rSBVKFe8VD&sig=3MNVVSq8bDZs4koa-yMP6PaNT-Q&hl=en&ei=jR4hTIK_AsP48AbV_shl&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Plotinus%27s%20Anti-Gnostic%20Polemic%20and%20Porphyry%27s%20Against%20the%20Christians%22%20Christos%20Evangeliou&f=false p. 111.]</ref> that Plotinus' opponents might be better described as simply \"Christian Gnostics\", arguing that several of Plotinus' criticisms are as applicable to orthodox Christian doctrine as well. Also, considering the evidence from the time, Evangeliou thought the definition of the term \"Gnostics\" was unclear. Of note here is that while Plotinus' student [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] names [[Christianity]] specifically in Porphyry's works, and Plotinus is to have been a known associate of the Christian [[Origen]], none of Plotinus' works mention Christ or Christianity\u2014. In contrast, Plotinus specifically addresses his target in the ''Enneads'' as the Gnostics.\n\n[[A. H. Armstrong]] identified the so-called \"Gnostics\" that Plotinus was attacking as Jewish and Pagan, in his introduction to the tract in his translation of the ''Enneads''. Armstrong alluding to Gnosticism being a Hellenic philosophical heresy of sorts, which later engaged Christianity and Neoplatonism.<ref>From \"Introduction to Against the Gnostics,\" Plotinus' ''Enneads'' as translated by A. H. Armstrong, pp. 220\u2013222: \"The treatise as it stands in the Enneads is a most powerful protest on behalf of Hellenic philosophy against the un-Hellenic heresy (as it was from the Platonist as well as the orthodox Christian point of view) of Gnosticism. There were Gnostics among Plotinus's friends, whom he had not succeeded in converting (Enneads ch. 10 of this treatise), and he and his pupils devoted considerable time and energy to anti-Gnostic controversy (Life of Plotinus ch. 16). He considered Gnosticism a dangerous influence, likely to pervert the minds even of members of his circle. It is impossible to attempt to give an account of Gnosticism here. By far, the best discussion of what the particular group of Gnostics Plotinus knew believed is M. Puech's admirable contribution to Entretiens Hardt V (Les Sources de Plotin). But it is important for the understanding of this treatise to be clear about the reasons why Plotinus disliked them so intensely and thought their influence so harmful.\"</ref><ref>Armstrong, pp. 220\u201322: \"Short statement of the doctrine of the three hypostasis, the One, Intellect, and Soul; there cannot be more or fewer than these three.

The [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] adopted the term \"demiurge\". Although a fashioner, the demiurge is not necessarily the same as the creator figure in the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] sense, because the demiurge itself and the material from which the demiurge fashions the universe are both considered to be consequences of something else. Depending on the system, they may be considered to be either uncreated and eternal or the product of some other entity.\n\nThe word \"demiurge\" is an English word derived from ''demiurgus'', a [[List of Latinised names|Latinised]] form of the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2}} or ''d\u0113miurg\u00f3s''. It was originally a common noun meaning \"craftsman\" or \"artisan,\" but gradually came to mean \"producer,\" and eventually \"creator.\" The philosophical usage and the proper noun derive from [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Plato's ''Timaeus'']], written {{circa}}&nbsp;360 BC, where the demiurge is presented as the creator of the universe. The demiurge is also described as a creator in the Platonic ({{circa}}&nbsp;310\u201390 BC) and Middle Platonic ({{circa}}&nbsp;90 BC-AD 300) philosophical traditions. In the various branches of the Neoplatonic school (third century onwards), the demiurge is the fashioner of the real, perceptible world after the model of the [[Theory of Forms|<!-- capitalized-->Ideas]], but (in most Neoplatonic systems) is still not itself \"[[Form of the Good|the One]].\" In the arch-[[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]] ideology of the various Gnostic systems, the material universe is evil, while the non-material world is good. According to some strains of Gnosticism, the demiurge is [[Evil|malevolent]], as it is linked to the material world. In others, including the teaching of [[Valentinianism|Valentinus]], the demiurge is simply ignorant or misguided.\n\n==Platonism and neoplatonism==\n[[Plato]], as the speaker Timaeus, refers to the Demiurge frequently in the [[Socratic dialogue]] ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (28a [[wikt:ff.#Abbreviation|ff.]]), {{circa}}&nbsp;360 BC. The main character refers to the Demiurge as the entity who \"fashioned and shaped\" the material world. Timaeus describes the Demiurge as unreservedly [[:wikt:benevolence|benevolent]], and so it desires a world as good as possible. Plato's work ''Timaeus'' is a philosophical reconciliation of [[Hesiod]]'s cosmology in his ''[[Theogony]]'', [[syncretism|syncretically]] reconciling Hesiod to [[Homer]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Python: A Study of Delphic Myth and Its Origin|year=1974|first=Joseph|last=Fontenrose|page=226|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h56ansk4SyQC&pg=PA226 | isbn=978-0-8196-0285-5 | publisher=Biblo & Tannen Publishers}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Chorology: On Beginning in Plato's Timaeus|year=1999|first=John|last=Sallis|page=86|isbn=0-253-21308-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gS_9aQ5mYKgC&pg=PA86 | publisher=Indiana University Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The mythology of ancient Greece and Italy|first=Thomas|last=Keightley|year=1838|page=[https://archive.org/details/mythologyancien04keiggoog/page/n90 44]|publisher=Oxford University|url=https://archive.org/details/mythologyancien04keiggoog|quote=theogony timaeus.}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Platonism===\nIn [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]]'s [[Neo-Pythagorean]] and Middle Platonist [[cosmogony]], the Demiurge is second God as the ''[[nous]]'' or thought of intelligibles and sensibles.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans|last=Kahn|first=Charles|publisher=Hacket Publishing|year=|isbn=978-0-872205758|location=Indianapolis|pages=124}}</ref>\n\n===Neoplatonism===\n[[Plotinus]] and the later Platonists worked to clarify the Demiurge.

The second principle is organization in its reflection of the [[Sentience|nonsentient]] force or ''[[Potentiality and actuality|dynamis]]'', also called the one or the Monad. The dyad is ''energeia'' emanated by the one that is then the work, process or activity called ''nous'', Demiurge, mind, consciousness that organizes the indeterminate vitality into the experience called the material world, universe, cosmos. [[Plotinus]] also elucidates the equation of matter with nothing or non-being in ''[[The Enneads]]''<ref>\"Matter is therefore a non-existent\"; Plotinus, ''Ennead'' 2, Tractate 4 Section 16.</ref> which more correctly is to express the concept of [[idealism]] or that there is not anything or anywhere outside of the \"mind\" or ''nous'' (c.f. [[pantheism]]).\n\nPlotinus' form of [[Platonic idealism]] is to treat the Demiurge, ''nous'' as the contemplative faculty (''ergon'') within man which orders the force (''dynamis'') into conscious reality.<ref>[[Schopenhauer]] wrote of this Neoplatonist philosopher: \"With Plotinus there even appears, probably for the first time in [[Western philosophy]], idealism that had long been current in the East even at that time, for it taught (Enneads, iii, lib. vii, c.10) that the soul has made the world by stepping from eternity into time, with the explanation: 'For there is for this universe no other place than the soul or mind' (''neque est alter hujus universi locus quam anima''), indeed the ideality of time is expressed in the words: 'We should not accept time outside the soul or mind' (''oportet autem nequaquam extra animam tempus accipere'').\" (Parerga and Paralipomena, Volume I, \"Fragments for the History of Philosophy,\" \u00a7&nbsp;7) Similarly, Professor Ludwig Noir\u00e9 wrote: \"For the first time in Western philosophy we find idealism proper in Plotinus (Enneads, iii, 7, 10), where he says, 'The only space or place of the world is the soul,' and 'Time must not be assumed to exist outside the soul.'\" [5] It is worth noting, however, that like Plato but unlike Schopenhauer and other modern philosophers, Plotinus does not worry about whether or how we can get beyond our ideas to know external objects.</ref> In this, he claimed to reveal Plato's true meaning: a doctrine he learned from Platonic tradition that did not appear outside the academy or in Plato's text. This tradition of creator God as ''nous'' (the manifestation of consciousness), can be validated in the works of pre-Plotinus philosophers such as [[Numenius of Apamea|Numenius]], as well as a connection between Hebrew and Platonic cosmology (see also [[Philo]]).<ref>[[Numenius of Apamea]] was reported to have asked, \"What else is Plato than Moses speaking Greek?\" Fr. 8 Des Places.</ref>\n\nThe Demiurge of Neoplatonism is the ''Nous'' (mind of God), and is one of the three ordering principles:\n* ''[[Arche]]'' (Gr. \"beginning\") \u2013 the source of all things,\n* ''[[Logos]]'' (Gr. \"reason/cause\") \u2013 the underlying order that is hidden beneath appearances,\n* ''[[:wikt:harmonia|Harmonia]]'' (Gr. \"harmony\") \u2013 numerical [[ratios]] in [[mathematics]].\n\nBefore Numenius of Apamea and Plotinus' ''[[Enneads]]'', no Platonic works ontologically clarified the Demiurge from the [[allegory]] in Plato's ''Timaeus''. The idea of Demiurge was, however, addressed before Plotinus in the works of Christian writer [[Justin Martyr]] who built his understanding of the Demiurge on the works of Numenius.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n====Iamblichus====\n{{See also|Panentheism}}\nLater, the Neoplatonist [[Iamblichus of Chalcis|Iamblichus]] changed the role of the \"One,\" effectively altering the role of the Demiurge as second cause or dyad, which was one of the reasons that Iamblichus and his teacher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] came into conflict.\n\nThe figure of the Demiurge emerges in the theoretic of Iamblichus, which conjoins the transcendent, incommunicable \u201cOne,\u201d or Source. Here, at the summit of this system, the Source and Demiurge (material realm) coexist via the process of ''[[henosis]]''.<ref>See [http://www.theandros.com/iamblichus.html Theurgy, Iamblichus and henosis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109100359/http://www.theandros.com/iamblichus.html |date=2010-01-09 }}.</ref>\nIamblichus describes the One as a monad whose first principle or emanation is intellect (''nous''), while among \"the many\" that follow it there is a second, super-existent \"One\" that is the producer of intellect or soul (''psyche'').\n\nThe \"One\" is further separated into spheres of intelligence; the first and superior sphere is objects of thought, while the latter sphere is the domain of thought. Thus, a [[wikt:triad#Noun|triad]] is formed of the [[perception|intelligible]] ''nous'', the [[noesis|intellective]] ''nous'', and the ''[[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]'' in order to reconcile further the various Hellenistic philosophical schools of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Actus et potentia|''actus'' and ''potentia'']] (actuality and potentiality) of the [[unmoved mover]] and Plato's Demiurge.\n\nThen within this intellectual triad Iamblichus assigns the third rank to the Demiurge, identifying it with the perfect or Divine ''nous'' with the intellectual triad being promoted to a ''hebdomad'' (pure intellect).\n\nIn the theoretic of Plotinus, ''nous'' produces nature through intellectual mediation, thus the intellectualizing gods are followed by a triad of psychic gods.\n\n==Gnosticism==\n{{Split section |Yaldabaoth|discuss={{TALKPAGENAME}}#Split proposed |date=November 2018}}\n{{gnosticism}}\n[[Gnosticism]] presents a distinction between the highest, unknowable God or [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Supreme Being]] and the demiurgic \"creator\" of the material. Several systems of Gnostic thought present the Demiurge as antagonistic to the will of the Supreme Being: his act of creation occurs in an unconscious semblance of the divine model, and thus is fundamentally flawed, or else is formed with the malevolent intention of entrapping aspects of the divine ''in'' materiality. Thus, in such systems, the Demiurge acts as a solution to (or, at least possibly, the problem or cause that gives rise to){{citation needed|date=March 2014}} the [[problem of evil]].\n\n===Mythos===\nOne Gnostic [[mythos]] describes the declination of aspects of the divine into human form. [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] (Greek: \u03a3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1, lit. \"wisdom\"), the Demiurge's mother and partial aspect of the divine ''[[Pleroma]]'' or \"Fullness,\" desired to create something apart from the [[Absolute (philosophy)|divine totality]], without the receipt of divine assent. In this act of separate creation, she gave birth to the monstrous Demiurge and, being ashamed of her deed, wrapped him in a cloud and created a throne for him within it. The Demiurge, isolated, did not behold his mother, nor anyone else, and concluded that only he existed, ignorant of the superior levels of reality.\n\nThe Demiurge, having received a portion of power from his mother, sets about a work of creation in unconscious imitation of the superior [[Pleroma|Pleromatic]] realm: He frames the [[seven heavens]], as well as all material and animal things, according to forms furnished by his mother; working, however, blindly and ignorant even of the existence of the mother who is the source of all his energy. He is blind to all that is spiritual, but he is king over the other two provinces. The word ''d\u0113miurgos'' properly describes his relation to the material; he is the ''father'' of that which is animal-like himself.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103105.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 5, 1.]</ref>\n\nThus Sophia's power becomes enclosed within the material forms of humanity, themselves entrapped within the material universe. In essence, the goal of Gnostic movements was typically the awakening of this spark, which permitted a return by the subject to the superior, non-material realities, which were its primal source.\n\n===Angels===\n[[Psalm 82]] begins ({{bibleref2|Psa|82:1|NET|verse 1}}), \"God stands in the assembly of [[El (deity)|El]] {{bracket|[[Septuagint|LXX]]: the assembly of gods}}, amid the gods he renders judgment,\" indicating a plurality of gods. However, it does not indicate that these gods were co-actors in creation. [[Philo]] had inferred from the expression \"Let us make man\" of the [[Book of Genesis]] that God had used other beings as assistants in the creation of man, and he explains in this way why man is capable of vice as well as virtue, ascribing the origin of the latter to God, of the former to His helpers in the work of creation.<ref>{{quote|It is on this account that Moses says, at the creation of man alone that God said, \"Let us make man,\" which expression shows an assumption of other beings to himself as assistants, so that God, the governor of all things, might have all the blameless intentions and actions of man when he does right attributed to him; and that his other assistants might bear the imputation of his contrary actions.|{{cite web |title=Philo: On the Creation, XXIV |url=http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book1.html |website=www.earlyjewishwritings.com}}}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest Gnostic sects ascribe the work of creation to angels, some of them using the same passage in Genesis.<ref>[[Justin Martyr]], ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. c. 67.</ref> So [[Irenaeus]] tells<ref>Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 23, 1.</ref> of the system of [[Simon Magus]],<ref>Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 23, 5.</ref> of the system of [[Menander (gnostic)|Menander]],<ref>Irenaeus, i. 24, 1.</ref> of the system of Saturninus, in which the number of these angels is reckoned as seven, and<ref>Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 25.</ref> of the system of [[Carpocrates]]. In the report of the system of [[Basilides]],<ref>Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 24, 4.</ref> we are told that our world was made by the angels who occupy the lowest heaven; but special mention is made of their chief, who is said to have been the [[God in Judaism|God of the Jews]], to have led that people out of the land of [[Egypt]], and to have given them their law. The prophecies are ascribed not to the chief but to the other world-making angels.\n\nThe Latin translation, confirmed by [[Hippolytus of Rome]],<ref>Hippolytus, ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]''. vii. 33.</ref> makes [[Irenaeus]] state that according to [[Cerinthus]] (who shows [[Ebionites|Ebionite]] influence), creation was made by a power quite separate from the Supreme God and ignorant of Him. [[Theodoret]],<ref>Theodoret, ''Haer. Fab''. ii. 3.</ref> who here copies Irenaeus, turns this into the plural number \"powers,\" and so [[Epiphanius of Salamis]]<ref>Epiphanius, ''[[Panarion]]'', 28.</ref> represents Cerinthus as agreeing with Carpocrates in the doctrine that angels made the world.\n\n===Yaldabaoth===\n[[File:Lion-faced deity.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A lion-faced deity found on a Gnostic gem in [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]'s ''L'antiquit\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e et repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en figures'' may be a depiction of the Demiurge.]]\n\nIn the [[Ophites|Ophite]] and [[Sethians|Sethian]] systems, which have many affinities with the teachings of Valentinus, the making of the world is ascribed to a company of seven [[archon (Gnosticism)|archons]], whose names are given, but still more prominent is their chief, \"Yaldabaoth\" (also known as \"Yaltabaoth\" or \"Ialdabaoth\").\n\nIn the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]'' {{circa}}&nbsp; AD 120\u2013180, the demiurge arrogantly declares that he has made the world by himself:\n<blockquote>\nNow the [[archon]] [\"ruler\"], who is weak, has three names. The first name is Yaltabaoth, the second is Saklas [\"fool\"], and the third is [[Samael]]. And he is impious in his arrogance, which is in him. For he said, 'I am God, and there is no other God beside me,' for he is ignorant of his strength, the place from which he had come.<ref>\"Apocryphon of John,\" translation by Frederik Wisse in ''The Nag Hammadi Library''. Accessed online at [http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/apocjn.html gnosis.org]</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe is Demiurge and maker of man, but as a ray of light from above enters the body of a man and gives him a soul, Yaldabaoth is filled with envy; he tries to limit man's knowledge by forbidding him the fruit of knowledge in paradise. At the consummation of all things, all light will return to the [[Pleroma]]. But Yaldabaoth, the Demiurge, with the material world, will be cast into the lower depths.<ref name=\"Catholic\">{{Catholic|wstitle=Demiurge|inline=yes}}</ref>\n\nYaldabaoth is frequently called \"the Lion-faced,\" ''leontoeides'', and is said to have the body of a serpent. The demiurge is also<ref>Hipp. ''Ref''. vi. 32, p.&nbsp;191.</ref> described as having a fiery nature, applying the words of Moses to him: \"the Lord our God is a burning and consuming fire.\" Hippolytus claims that Simon used a similar description.<ref>Hipp. ''Ref''. vi. 9.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Pistis Sophia]]'', Yaldabaoth has already sunk from his high estate and resides in Chaos, where, with his forty-nine demons, he tortures wicked souls in boiling rivers of the pitch, and with other punishments (pp.&nbsp;257, 382). He is an archon with the face of a lion, half flame, and half-darkness.\n\nUnder the name of ''Nebro'' (rebel), Yaldabaoth is called an angel in the [[apocryphal]] ''[[Gospel of Judas]]''. He is first mentioned in \"The Cosmos, Chaos, and the Underworld\" as one of the twelve angels to come \"into being [to] rule over chaos and the [underworld].\" He comes from heaven, and it is said his \"face flashed with fire and [his] appearance was defiled with blood.\" Nebro creates six angels in addition to the angel [[Saklas]] to be his assistants. These six, in turn, create another twelve angels \"with each one receiving a portion in the heavens.\"\n\n====Names====\n[[File:Leontocephaline-Ostia.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Drawing of the lion-headed figure found at the [[Mithraeum]] of C.&nbsp;Valerius Heracles and sons, dedicated 190&nbsp;CE at [[Ostia Antica]], Italy (CIMRM 312).]]\n\nThe most probable derivation of the name \"Yaldabaoth\" was given by [[Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler]]. Giesler believed the name was derived from the Aramaic ''yald\u0101 bahuth'', {{lang|arc|\u05d9\u05dc\u05d3\u05d0\u05d1\u05d4\u05d5\u05ea}}, meaning \"Son of Chaos.\" However, [[Gilles Quispel]] notes:\n{{quote|[[Gershom Scholem]], the third genius in this field, more specifically the genius of precision, had taught us that some of us were wrong when they believed that Jaldabaoth means \"son of chaos\" because the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''bahutha'' in the sense of chaos only existed in the imagination of the author of a well-known dictionary. This is a pity because this name would suit the demiurge risen from chaos to a nicety. And perhaps the author of the ''[[On the Origin of the World|Untitled Document]]'' did not know Aramaic and also supposed as we did once, that ''baoth'' had something to do with ''[[Tohu wa-bohu|tohuwabohu]]'', one of the few Hebrew words that everybody knows. ... It would seem then that the Orphic view of the demiurge was integrated into Jewish Gnosticism even before the redaction of the myth contained in the original ''[[Apocryphon of John]]''. ... [[Phanes]] is represented with the mask of a ''lion's'' head on his breast, while from his sides, the heads of a ram and a buck are budding forth: his body is encircled by a snake. This type was accepted by the [[Mithraism|Mithras mysteries]], to indicate [[Aion (deity)|Aion]], the new year, and Mithras, whose numerical value is 365. Sometimes he is also identified with Jao Adonai, the creator of the Hebrews. His hieratic attitude indicates Egyptian origin. The same is true of [[Mithraism#lion-headed figure|the monstrous figure with the head of a lion]], which symbolises Time, [[Chronos]], in Mithraism; Alexandrian origin of this type is probable.<ref>{{cite book |last=Quispel |first=Gilles |authorlink=Gilles Quispel |page=64 |title=Gnostica, Judaica, Catholica: Collected Essays of Gilles Quispel |editor1-first= Johannes |editor1-last=Van Oort |isbn=978-90-04-13945-9 |year=2008 |publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV |location=Leiden}}</ref>}}\n\n\"[[Samael]]\" literally means \"Blind God\" or \"God of the Blind\" in Hebrew ({{hebrew|\u05e1\u05de\u05d0\u05dc}}). This being is considered not only blind, or ignorant of its own origins but may, in addition, be evil; its name is also found in [[Judaism]] as the [[Death (personification)#Death (angels) in religion|Angel of Death]] and in Christian [[demon]]ology. This link to the Judeo-Christian tradition leads to a further comparison with [[Satan]]. Another alternative title for the demiurge is \"Saklas,\" Aramaic for \"fool.\"\n\nThe angelic name \"[[Ariel (angel)|Ariel]]\" (meaning \"the lion of God\" in Hebrew)<ref>{{cite book |title=Jewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and Talmudic Tradition |first=Gershom |last=Scholem |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary of America |year=1965 |page=72}}</ref> has also been used to refer to the Demiurge and is called his \"perfect\" name;<ref>{{cite book |author=Robert McLachlan Wilson |title=Nag Hammadi and gnosis: Papers read at the First International Congress of Coptology |year=1976 |publisher=BRILL |pages=21\u201323 |quote=''Therefore his esoteric name is Jaldabaoth, whereas the perfect call him Ariel, because he has the appearance of a lion.''}}</ref> in some Gnostic lore, Ariel has been called an ancient or original name for Ialdabaoth.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gustav Davidson|title=A dictionary of angels: including the fallen angels |year=1994 |publisher=Scrollhouse |page=54}}</ref> The name has also been inscribed on amulets as \"Ariel Ialdabaoth\",<ref>{{cite book|author=David M Gwynn|title=Religious Diversity in Late Antiquity |year=2010 |publisher=BRILL |page=448}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Campbell Bonner |title=An Amulet of the Ophite Gnostics |year=1949 |publisher=The American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Hesperia Supplements, Vol. 8|pages=43\u201346}}</ref> and the figure of the archon inscribed with \"Aariel\".<ref>{{cite book |author1=Gilles Quispel |author2=R. van den Broek |author-link2=Roel van den Broek |author3=Maarten Jozef Vermaseren |title=Studies in gnosticism and hellenistic religions |year=1981 |publisher=BRILL |pages=40\u201341}}</ref>\n\n===Marcion===\nAccording to [[Marcion of Sinope|Marcion]], the title God was given to the Demiurge, who was to be sharply distinguished from the higher Good God. The former was ''d\u00edkaios,'' severely just, the latter ''agath\u00f3s,'' or loving-kind; the former was the \"god of this world\" ({{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|4:4}}), the God of the [[Old Testament]], the latter the true God of the [[New Testament]]. Christ, though in reality, the Son of the Good God, pretended to be the Messiah of the Demiurge, the better to spread the truth concerning His heavenly Father. The true believer in Christ entered into God's kingdom; the unbeliever remained forever the slave of the Demiurge.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n===Valentinus===\nIt is in the [[Valentinianism|system of Valentinus]] that the name ''D\u0113miurgos'' is used, which occurs nowhere in Irenaeus except in connection with the Valentinian system; we may reasonably conclude that it was Valentinus who adopted from Platonism the use of this word. When it is employed by other Gnostics either, it is not used in a technical sense, or its use has been borrowed from Valentinus. But it is only the name that can be said to be specially Valentinian; the personage intended by it corresponds more or less closely with the Yaldabaoth of the Ophites, the [[Abraxas|great Archon]] of Basilides, the Elohim of [[Justin (gnostic)|Justinus]], etc.\n\nThe Valentinian theory elaborates that from Achamoth (''he k\u00e1t\u014d soph\u00eda'' or lower wisdom) three kinds of substance take their origin, the spiritual (''pneumatiko\u00ed''), the animal (''psychiko\u00ed'') and the material (''hyliko\u00ed''). The Demiurge belongs to the second kind, as he was the offspring of a union of Achamoth with the matter.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/><ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103105.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 5.]</ref> And as Achamoth herself was only the daughter of ''Soph\u00eda'' the last of the thirty Aeons, the Demiurge was distant by many emanations from the Propat\u00f4r, or Supreme God.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nIn creating this world out of Chaos, the Demiurge was unconsciously influenced for good; and the universe, to the surprise even of its Maker, became almost perfect. The Demiurge regretted even its slight imperfection, and as he thought himself the Supreme God, he attempted to remedy this by sending a Messiah. To this Messiah, however, was actually united with Jesus the Saviour, Who redeemed men. These are either ''hyliko\u00ed'' or ''pneumatiko\u00ed''.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\nThe first, or material men, will return to the grossness of matter and finally be consumed by fire; the second, or animal men, together with the Demiurge, will enter a middle state, neither Pleroma nor ''hyle''; the purely spiritual men will be completely freed from the influence of the Demiurge and together with the Saviour and Achamoth, his spouse, will enter the Pleroma divested of body (''hyle'') and soul (''psych\u00e9'').<ref name=\"Catholic\"/><ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103106.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 6.]</ref> In this most common form of Gnosticism the Demiurge had an inferior though not intrinsically evil function in the universe as the head of the animal, or psychic world.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n===The devil===\nOpinions on [[the devil]], and his relationship to the Demiurge, varied. The Ophites held that he and his demons constantly oppose and thwart the human race, as it was on their account the devil was cast down into this world.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103130.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 30, 8.]</ref> According to one variant of the Valentinian system, the Demiurge is also the maker, out of the appropriate substance, of an order of ''spiritual'' beings, the devil, the prince of this world, and his angels. But the devil, as being a ''spirit'' of wickedness, is able to recognize the higher spiritual world, of which his maker the Demiurge, who is the only animal, has no real knowledge. The devil resides in this lower world, of which he is the prince, the Demiurge in the heavens; his mother Sophia in the middle region, above the heavens and below the Pleroma.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103105.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', i. 5, 4.]</ref>\n\nThe Valentinian [[Heracleon]]<ref>[http://www.gnosis.org/library/fragh.htm Heracleon, Frag. 20.]</ref> interpreted the devil as the ''principle'' of evil, that of ''hyle'' (matter). As he writes in his commentary on {{bibleverse||John|4:21}},\n<blockquote>The mountain represents the Devil, or his world since the Devil was one part of the whole of matter, but the world is the total mountain of evil, a deserted dwelling place of beasts, to which all who lived before the law and all Gentiles render worship. But Jerusalem represents the creation of the Creator whom the Jews worship. ... You then who are spiritual should worship neither the creation nor the Craftsman, but the Father of Truth. </blockquote>\n\nThis vilification of the creator was held to be inimical to Christianity by the early fathers of the church. In refuting the beliefs of the gnostics, [[Irenaeus]] stated that \"Plato is proved to be more religious than these men, for he allowed that the same God was both just and good, having power over all things, and himself executing judgment.\"<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0103325.htm Irenaeus, ''Adversus Haereses'', iii. 25.]</ref>\n\n===Cathars===\n[[Catharism]] inherited their idea of Satan as the creator of the evil world from Gnosticism. Quispel writes,\n\n{{quote|There is a direct link between ancient Gnosticism and Catharism. The Cathars held that the creator of the world, Satanael, had usurped the name of God, but that he had subsequently been unmasked and told that he was not really God.<ref>Quispel, Gilles and Van Oort, Johannes (2008), p. 143.</ref>}}\n\n==Neoplatonism and Gnosticism==\n{{Main|Neoplatonism, and Gnosticism}}\n{{Wikisource|1=Enneads/Against the Gnostics; or, Against Those That Affirm the Creator of the Cosmos and the Cosmos Itself to be Evil|2=Against the Gnostics; or, Against Those That Affirm the Creator of the Cosmos and the Cosmos Itself to be Evil}}\nGnosticism attributed falsehood or evil to the concept of the Demiurge or creator. However, in some Gnostic traditions, the creator is from a fallen, ignorant, or lesser\u2014rather than evil\u2014perspective, such as that of [[Valentinius]].\n\n===Plotinus===\nThe Neoplatonic philosopher [[Plotinus]] addressed within his works Gnosticism's conception of the Demiurge, which he saw as un-[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] and blasphemous to the Demiurge or creator of Plato. Plotinus, along with his teacher [[Ammonius Saccas]], was the founder of [[Neoplatonism]].<ref>John D. Turner. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140816004048/http://www.unl.edu/classics/faculty/turner/triadaft.htm Neoplatonism].</ref> In the ninth [[tractate]] of the second of his ''Enneads'', Plotinus criticizes his opponents for their appropriation of ideas from Plato:\n\n{{quote|From Plato come their punishments, their rivers of the underworld and the changing from body to body; as for the plurality they assert in the Intellectual Realm\u2014the Authentic Existent, the Intellectual-Principle, ''the Second Creator and the Soul''\u2014all this is taken over from the Timaeus.|Ennead 2.9.vi; emphasis added from [[A. H. Armstrong]]'s introduction to Ennead 2.9}}\n\nOf note here is the remark concerning the second [[hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]] or Creator and third hypostasis or [[Anima mundi|World Soul]]. Plotinus criticizes his opponents for \"all the novelties through which they seek to establish a philosophy of their own\" which, he declares, \"have been picked up outside of the truth\";<ref name=\"sacred-texts\">\"For, in sum, a part of their doctrine comes from Plato; all the novelties through which they seek to establish a philosophy of their own have been picked up outside of the truth.\" Plotinus, \"Against the Gnostics,\" [http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plotenn/enn161.htm ''Ennead'' II, 9, 6.]</ref> they attempt to conceal rather than admit their indebtedness to ancient philosophy, which they have corrupted by their extraneous and misguided embellishments. Thus their understanding of the Demiurge is similarly flawed in comparison to Plato\u2019s original intentions.\n\nWhereas Plato's Demiurge is good wishing good on his creation, Gnosticism contends that the Demiurge is not only the originator of evil but is evil as well. Hence the title of Plotinus' refutation: \"Against Those That Affirm the Creator of the Kosmos and the Kosmos Itself to be Evil\" (generally quoted as \"Against the Gnostics\"). Plotinus argues of the disconnect or great barrier that is created between the ''nous'' or the mind's [[noumenon]] (see [[Heraclitus]]) and the material world ([[phenomenon]]) by believing the material world is evil.\n\nThe majority of scholars tend<ref>{{cite book|title=Plotinus: Enneads II|edition=Loeb Classical Library|author=Plotinus, Arthur Hilary Armstrong (trans.)|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1966|quote=From this point to the end of ch. 12 Plotinus is attacking a Gnostic myth known to us best at present in the form it took in the system of Valentinus. The Mother, Sophia-Achamoth, produced as a result of the complicated sequence of events which followed the fall of the higher Sophia, and her offspring the Demiurge, the inferior and ignorant maker of the material universe, are Valentinian figures; cp. Irenaeus, ''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' 1.4 and 5. Valentinius had been in Rome, and there is nothing improbable in the presence of Valentinians there in the time of Plotinus. But the evidence in the ''Life'' ch. 16 suggests that the Gnostics in Plotinus's circle belonged rather to the older group called Sethians or [[Archontics]], related to the [[Ophites]] or [[Barbelo]]gnostics: they probably called themselves simply 'Gnostics.' Gnostic sects borrowed freely from each other, and it is likely that Valentinius took some of his ideas about Sophia from older Gnostic sources, and that his ideas, in turn, influenced other Gnostics.}}</ref> to understand Plotinus' opponents as being a Gnostic sect\u2014certainly (specifically [[Sethianism|Sethian]]), several such groups were present in [[Alexandria]] and elsewhere about the [[Mediterranean]] during Plotinus' lifetime. Plotinus specifically points to the Gnostic doctrine of Sophia and her emission of the Demiurge.\n\nThough the former understanding certainly enjoys the most significant popularity, the identification of Plotinus' opponents as Gnostic is not without some contention. Christos Evangeliou has contended<ref>Evangeliou, \"Plotinus's Anti-Gnostic Polemic and Porphyry's Against the Christians,\" in Wallis & Bregman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=WSbrLPup7wYC&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=Plotinus%27s+Anti-Gnostic+Polemic+and+Porphyry%27s+Against+the+Christians%22+Christos+Evangeliou&source=bl&ots=rSBVKFe8VD&sig=3MNVVSq8bDZs4koa-yMP6PaNT-Q&hl=en&ei=jR4hTIK_AsP48AbV_shl&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Plotinus%27s%20Anti-Gnostic%20Polemic%20and%20Porphyry%27s%20Against%20the%20Christians%22%20Christos%20Evangeliou&f=false p. 111.]</ref> that Plotinus' opponents might be better described as simply \"Christian Gnostics\", arguing that several of Plotinus' criticisms are as applicable to orthodox Christian doctrine as well. Also, considering the evidence from the time, Evangeliou thought the definition of the term \"Gnostics\" was unclear. Of note here is that while Plotinus' student [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] names [[Christianity]] specifically in Porphyry's works, and Plotinus is to have been a known associate of the Christian [[Origen]], none of Plotinus' works mention Christ or Christianity\u2014. In contrast, Plotinus specifically addresses his target in the ''Enneads'' as the Gnostics.\n\n[[A. H. Armstrong]] identified the so-called \"Gnostics\" that Plotinus was attacking as Jewish and Pagan, in his introduction to the tract in his translation of the ''Enneads''. Armstrong alluding to Gnosticism being a Hellenic philosophical heresy of sorts, which later engaged Christianity and Neoplatonism.<ref>From \"Introduction to Against the Gnostics,\" Plotinus' ''Enneads'' as translated by A. H. Armstrong, pp. 220\u2013222: \"The treatise as it stands in the Enneads is a most powerful protest on behalf of Hellenic philosophy against the un-Hellenic heresy (as it was from the Platonist as well as the orthodox Christian point of view) of Gnosticism. There were Gnostics among Plotinus's friends, whom he had not succeeded in converting (Enneads ch. 10 of this treatise), and he and his pupils devoted considerable time and energy to anti-Gnostic controversy (Life of Plotinus ch. 16). He considered Gnosticism a dangerous influence, likely to pervert the minds even of members of his circle. It is impossible to attempt to give an account of Gnosticism here. By far, the best discussion of what the particular group of Gnostics Plotinus knew believed is M. Puech's admirable contribution to Entretiens Hardt V (Les Sources de Plotin). But it is important for the understanding of this treatise to be clear about the reasons why Plotinus disliked them so intensely and thought their influence so harmful.\"</ref><ref>Armstrong, pp. 220\u201322: \"Short statement of the doctrine of the three hypostasis, the One, Intellect, and Soul; there cannot be more or fewer than these three.

Inspired by several [[high fantasy]] [[Historical fantasy#Medieval fantasy|medieval]]-themed beat 'em up [[arcade game]]s from [[Capcom]] and [[Sega]], ''Legend'' was conceived as an idea by Perconti and Belaidouni to create their own action-oriented project.<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/>\n\n''Legend'' garnered mixed reception from critics since its initial release on the Super Nintendo. While the graphics received unanimous praise, many of the reviewers felt divided in regards to the sound department and gameplay, which was deemed by some as repetitive. Although it never received a direct sequel, Toka later created a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the game for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] which was also called ''[[Legend (1998 video game)|Legend]]''. In [[2015 in video gaming|2015]], the original game was ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] by independent developer and publisher [[Piko Interactive]]. A [[spiritual successor]], ''Konan'', was also in development and planned for the [[Atari Jaguar]] by both Perconti and Belaidouni but was never finished and released.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:SNES Legend.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot.]]\n''Legend'' is an arcade-style side-scrolling hack and slash beat 'em up game similar to ''[[Golden Axe (video game)|Golden Axe]]'' and ''[[The King of Dragons]]'' where players take control of Kaor and Igor through seven stages in total of varying thematic set in the kingdom of Sellech and battling against an assortment of enemies along the journey, with the main objective being defeating the corrupt son of the land's king, Clovis, before he manages to break free the sealed remnant of Beldor's powers and conquers Sellech.<ref name=\"EGM51\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_51/page/n125|title=Fact-Files - Super NES - Legend|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=51|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=October 1993|pages=124-125}}</ref><ref name=\"GP35\">{{cite magazine|last=Lundrigan|first=Jeff|url=https://archive.org/details/Game_Players_Issue_35_December_1993/page/n75|title=Features - Legend|magazine=[[Game Players]]|issue=35|publisher=Signal Research|date=December 1993|pages=72-74}}</ref> The characters have several fighting abilities in their disposal to counterattack such as their swords, kicks and [[Incantation|magic spell]]s.<ref name=\"GP35\"/> Players can also block incoming enemy attacks by using their shields.<ref name=\"GP35\"/> There are also special techniques that can be performed by pressing a combination of buttons such as a jump slash, among others at the cost of health. Defeating certain enemies also drops items that can be picked up such as food, magic bags and extra lives.<ref name=\"GP35\"/> After completing a level, players would be sent to a bonus round where items can be collected for points or picked up for later use in the game.<ref name=\"GP35\"/> Although there are seven stages, one of them can only be accessed if the players are captured by the enemies and imprisoned in a dungeon during a boss fight. In the options menu, players can customize the color of their clothing as well as the ability to change the default difficulty setting or share lives between each other during co-op play.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe story of the game is that the maleficent despot Beldor reigned over the kingdom of Sellech for 1000 years, bringing chaos and destruction to the land. Many knights went on a crusade to overthrow Beldor but none of them ever returned. United, people built energized heroes, managing to seal the soul of Beldor and peace was brought to the land afterwards. Clovis, the corrupt son of the king of Sellech, now seeks to harness the power of Beldor and conquer the kingdom by doing so.<ref name=\"GP35\"/> As such, players assume the role of knight warriors Kaor and Igor in order to defeat Clovis. After travelling across the land, meeting townsfolks who aid them in their quest, while battling against enemies and creatures, both Kaor and Igor reach the [[sanctuary]] where Clovis resides and after finally defeating him, Beldor's soul is vanished from the land and their glorious victory is widespread all over the world.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:SNES-Mod1-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|''Legend'' for the SNES was created under tight conditions in a short development time.]]\nCarlo Perconti worked for several companies such as [[Loriciels]] and [[Titus Interactive]] as a [[freelance]] graphic designer, while Lyes Belaidouni worked under the same area in the latter, who were mainly developing [[racing game]]s for [[Amstrad]] [[home computer]]s and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> Belaidouni preferred action-oriented titles but due to the then-current direction of productions under Titus, who also were not interested in developing for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System outside of publishing with the exception of ''[[Prehistorik Man]]'', he resigned along with Perconti and marketing manager Gabriel Guary to establish their own [[game development company]] called Arcade Zone to create titles for home consoles.<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> Their first idea was to create a game under the beat 'em up genre, which was not widely developed in North American and Europe in the 1990s, and were inspired by several arcade games from Capcom and Sega such as ''[[Knights of the Round (video game)|Knights of the Round]]'', ''Golden Axe'' and ''The King of Dragons'', with Perconti later stating that \"we made the game we wanted to play.\"<ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/>\n\nThe two co-founders were the sole authors of ''Legend'' which was developed as a passion project under turbulent conditions on a quick pace between two and three months, becoming the company's first project, with Perconti serving as its programmer.<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> The game was created from scratch as the team had no financial backing, no access to a software library, nor an official [[Nintendo]] development kit for the Super Nintendo, while Guary was in charge of the business side of the company.<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> Belaidouni made all the artwork for backgrounds and characters in ''[[Deluxe Paint]]'' on [[Amiga]] before being transferred to [[Personal computer|PC]] for Perconti, who handled hardware coordination and other tasks.<ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> After finishing development, the game was first showcased at [[Consumer Electronics Show]], where Capcom was also exhibiting the Super NES conversion of ''The King of Dragons''.<ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/><ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/details/Gamefan_Vol_1_Issue_09/page/n105|title=Summer CES '93|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=1|issue=9|publisher=DieHard Gamers Club|date=August 1993|pages=95-108}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_50/page/n101|title=Next Wave - Seika - Legend|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=50|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=September 1993|page=102}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''Legend'' was first released in North America on April 1994 by Seika Corporation and later in Europe by Sony Electronic Publishing on December 24 of the same year.

Inspired by several [[high fantasy]] [[Historical fantasy#Medieval fantasy|medieval]]-themed beat 'em up [[arcade game]]s from [[Capcom]] and [[Sega]], ''Legend'' was conceived as an idea by Perconti and Belaidouni to create their own action-oriented project.<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/>\n\n''Legend'' garnered mixed reception from critics since its initial release on the Super Nintendo. While the graphics received unanimous praise, many of the reviewers felt divided in regards to the sound department and gameplay, which was deemed by some as repetitive. Although it never received a direct sequel, Toka later created a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the game for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] which was also called ''[[Legend (1998 video game)|Legend]]''. In [[2015 in video gaming|2015]], the original game was ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] by independent developer and publisher [[Piko Interactive]].

Many knights went on a crusade to overthrow Beldor but none of them ever returned.

Clovis, the corrupt son of the king of Sellech, now seeks to harness the power of Beldor and conquer the kingdom by doing so.<ref name=\"GP35\"/> As such, players assume the role of knight warriors Kaor and Igor in order to defeat Clovis. After travelling across the land, meeting townsfolks who aid them in their quest, while battling against enemies and creatures, both Kaor and Igor reach the [[sanctuary]] where Clovis resides and after finally defeating him, Beldor's soul is vanished from the land and their glorious victory is widespread all over the world.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:SNES-Mod1-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|''Legend'' for the SNES was created under tight conditions in a short development time.]]\nCarlo Perconti worked for several companies such as [[Loriciels]] and [[Titus Interactive]] as a [[freelance]] graphic designer, while Lyes Belaidouni worked under the same area in the latter, who were mainly developing [[racing game]]s for [[Amstrad]] [[home computer]]s and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> Belaidouni preferred action-oriented titles but due to the then-current direction of productions under Titus, who also were not interested in developing for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System outside of publishing with the exception of ''[[Prehistorik Man]]'', he resigned along with Perconti and marketing manager Gabriel Guary to establish their own [[game development company]] called Arcade Zone to create titles for home consoles.<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> Their first idea was to create a game under the beat 'em up genre, which was not widely developed in North American and Europe in the 1990s, and were inspired by several arcade games from Capcom and Sega such as ''[[Knights of the Round (video game)|Knights of the Round]]'', ''Golden Axe'' and ''The King of Dragons'', with Perconti later stating that \"we made the game we wanted to play.\"<ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/>\n\nThe two co-founders were the sole authors of ''Legend'' which was developed as a passion project under turbulent conditions on a quick pace between two and three months, becoming the company's first project, with Perconti serving as its programmer.<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> The game was created from scratch as the team had no financial backing, no access to a software library, nor an official [[Nintendo]] development kit for the Super Nintendo, while Guary was in charge of the business side of the company.<ref name=\"C+33\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> Belaidouni made all the artwork for backgrounds and characters in ''[[Deluxe Paint]]'' on [[Amiga]] before being transferred to [[Personal computer|PC]] for Perconti, who handled hardware coordination and other tasks.<ref name=\"DHDIE\"/><ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/> After finishing development, the game was first showcased at [[Consumer Electronics Show]], where Capcom was also exhibiting the Super NES conversion of ''The King of Dragons''.<ref name=\"IwtMoL\"/><ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/details/Gamefan_Vol_1_Issue_09/page/n105|title=Summer CES '93|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=1|issue=9|publisher=DieHard Gamers Club|date=August 1993|pages=95-108}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/details/Electronic_Gaming_Monthly_50/page/n101|title=Next Wave - Seika - Legend|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=50|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=September 1993|page=102}}</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n''Legend'' was first released in North America on April 1994 by Seika Corporation and later in Europe by Sony Electronic Publishing on December 24 of the same year.

Previously, this applied to the Giants and Dodgers as well, before they moved out of New York City. Every historic and current venue for such games has been accessible via the [[New York City Subway]], hence the name of the series.\n\nThe term's historic usage has been in reference to [[World Series]] games played between the city's teams. The [[New York Yankees]] have appeared in all Subway Series games as they have been the only [[American League]] (AL) team based in the city, and have compiled an 11\u20133 all-time series record in the 14 championship Subway Series.\n\nSince 1997, the term '''Subway Series''' has been applied to [[interleague play]] during the regular season between the Yankees and New York City's [[National League]] (NL) team: the [[New York Mets]]. The Mets and Yankees also played each other in the [[2000 World Series]], in which the Yankees won.\n\n==19th century Trolley Series==\n{{main article|1889 World Series}}\n{{see also|Dodgers\u2013Giants rivalry}}\nAlthough organized games between all-stars from New York teams against all-stars from Brooklyn teams date back to the 1850s, the first actual New York-Brooklyn \"[[World Series|World Championship Series]]\" occurred in 1889, a full nine years before Brooklyn was incorporated into the City of New York by the Greater New York Act of 1898, when the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] squared off against (and defeated) the [[Brooklyn Bridegrooms]], also called the \"[[Trolley dodger|Trolley Dodgers]]\", of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]]. The following season, Brooklyn withdrew from the Association and joined the League, setting the stage for many future intra-city competitions.\n\nSome{{who|date=July 2015}} might argue that the 1889 Series would qualify as a \"Trolley Series\", but would not qualify as a Subway Series since [[Early history of the IRT subway|New York's subway did not open until 1904]].\n\nThe [[1906 World Series]] between the Chicago Cubs and the Chicago White Sox is also loosely referred to as a Subway Series, though the term Crosstown Series is more commonly used. The term is also inaccurate, since Chicago had surface systems from 1892 till the building of the State Street Subway in 1943.\n\n==Early and mid-20th century Subway Series==\nBy the 1920s, the [[New York City Subway|subway]] had become an important form of public transport in the city and provided a convenient form of travel between the three city ballparks: the [[Polo Grounds]], in upper [[Manhattan]]; [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], in [[the Bronx]]; and [[Ebbets Field]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The 155th Street [[155th Street (IRT Ninth Avenue Line)|elevated]] and [[155th Street (IND Concourse Line)|subway]] stations, the [[161st Street \u2013 Yankee Stadium (New York City Subway)|161st Street]] station, and the [[Prospect Park (BMT Brighton Line)|Prospect Park]]<nowiki/> respectively, served the ballparks. (New York's subway and elevated systems\u2014the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company|IRT]], [[Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company|BRT]]/[[Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation|BMT]], and [[Independent Subway System|IND]]\u2014were in competition with each other until 1940.)\n\nIn the case of the World Series contests listed, the entire Series could be attended by using the subway. The date of the first usage of the term \"Subway Series\" is uncertain. The term \"Nickel Series\" (a nickel was the [[New York City transit fares#Fare history|old subway fare]]) appeared in newspapers by 1927, and \"Subway Series\" appeared by 1928.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/subway_series/]</ref> \"Subway Series\" was clearly already a familiar concept by 1934, as discussed in this article about that year's All-Star Game to be held in New York, discussing the \"subway series\" possibility for the Giants and Yankees. (Ultimately, no New York team made it to the 1934 post-season.).<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|title=Terry and Cronin Select Squads For All-Star Game Here Tuesday|date=July 4, 1934|agency=Associated Press|page=21}}</ref>\n\n===Yankees\u2013Giants===\n{{main article|1921 World Series|1922 World Series|1923 World Series|1936 World Series|1937 World Series|1951 World Series|Giants\u2013Yankees rivalry}}\nThe 1921 and 1922 match-ups were played in a single ballpark, as both the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|Giants]] and Yankees then played at the Polo Grounds. The Giants won both of these World Series against the Yankees, the first two Subway Series played. Despite cordial relations just a few years before when the Yankees allowed the Giants to share their home at [[Hilltop Park]] for a year in 1911 and the Giants more than returning the favor in kind by sharing Polo Grounds with the Yankees since 1913, the Yankees were issued an eviction notice in mid-1920 ending their lease after the 1922 season. The Yankees opened their new ballpark in 1923. Fortunes changed immediately for the Yankees as they defeated the Giants this time in the third straight year of World Series competition between the two teams. Their new home would host the Yankees' first of 11 Subway World Series victories that year and first of an unprecedented 26 World Series until the stadium closed in 2008.\n\nThe venues for the 1923, 1936, 1937, and 1951 World Series&mdash;the Polo Grounds and [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|the old Yankee Stadium]]&mdash;were a short walk apart across the [[Macombs Dam Bridge]] over the [[Harlem River]]. <!--Of course, anyone in the city not living in that vicinity could have opted for the subway system.-->\n\n===Yankees\u2013Dodgers===\n{{main article|1941 World Series|1947 World Series|1949 World Series|1952 World Series|1953 World Series|1955 World Series|1956 World Series|Dodgers\u2013Yankees rivalry}}\nThe term was used again in 1941 when the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Dodgers]] made their first [[World Series]] appearance since 1920. Multiple Hall of Famers took part in these contests between the \"Bronx Bombers\" and \"Dem Bums from Brooklyn\" and the games involved numerous achievements including [[Jackie Robinson]] breaking the color barrier as the first African-American baseball player in the World Series and [[Don Larsen]]'s performance in pitching the only [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] in post-season history. The seven matchups between the Yankees and the Dodgers between 1941 and 1956 cemented the term as being mostly associated with the New York vs. Brooklyn contests, during the time when New York City was retroactively dubbed by historians as \"The Capital of Baseball\".<ref>{{cite video\n | people =\n | title = Baseball: A Film by Ken Burns; ''Inning 7: The Capital of Baseball''\n | medium =

to the five World Series played between the Yankees and Giants before 1940, the two teams also played exhibition series against each other from time to time. The match-ups were known as the \"City Series\" and were sometimes played in October while other teams played in the World Series.  However, after 1940, this became difficult because the Yankees would routinely appear in the World Series. In the 17 years from 1941 to 1957 (after which the Giants and Dodgers left New York City for California), the Yankees appeared in the World Series 12 times, failing to reach the Series only in 1944, 1945, 1946, 1948, and 1954.\n\nBefore New York's two National League teams left the city, the Yankees and Dodgers played an annual midseason exhibition game called the Mayor's Trophy Game to benefit sandlot baseball in New York City. The proceeds raised by the Yankees were given to leagues in Manhattan and the Bronx, while proceeds raised by the Dodgers went to leagues on Long Island and Staten Island.  The annual charity event was discontinued following the 1957 season, when the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles and the Giants moved to San Francisco. leaving the Yankees as the only major league team in the city. The game was revived in 1963, after the National League returned to New York with the expansion New York Mets in 1962.  After dwindling interest and public bickering between the owners of both teams, the Mayor's Trophy Game was discontinued following the 1983 season. It was revived again as a pre-[[Opening Day]] series titled the \"Mayor's Challenge\" and held in 1989.\n\n==Modern usage==\n[[File:Subway Series 2008.jpg|thumb|250px|Subway Series 2008, [[Johnny Damon]] with the Yankees (left) and [[Brian Schneider]] with the Mets]]\n[[File:Subway Series 2009.jpg|thumb|250px|A full house at the new [[Yankee Stadium]] for a Subway Series game against the Mets on June 13, 2009. The Mets won the game 6-2.]]\n{{see also|Mets\u2013Yankees rivalry}}\n\nIn modern usage, the term \"Subway Series\" generally refers to a series played between the two current New York baseball teams, the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[New York Mets]]. Their stadiums remain directly accessible by subway: [[Yankee Stadium]] via the [[161st Street\u2013Yankee Stadium (IRT Jerome Avenue Line)|161st Street\u2013Yankee Stadium]] station, and [[Citi Field]] via the [[Mets\u2013Willets Point (IRT Flushing Line)|Mets\u2013Willets Point]] station. It can also refer to any time two New York City-based teams play each other, such as the [[New York Knicks|Knicks]] and [[Brooklyn Nets|Nets]] in the [[NBA]], and the [[New York Rangers|Rangers]] and [[New York Islanders|Islanders]] in the [[NHL]]. All of these teams' venues are easily accessible via the New York City Subway as well.\n\nWith the departure of the Dodgers and Giants in the 1950s New York was left without a crosstown rivalry. Even with the Mets joining MLB they were placed in the National League opposite of the Yankees. When interleague play was introduced in 1997 the teams finally got to play one another in a competitive fashion. The rivalry has included heated moments such as the Roger Clemens and Mike Piazza feud. Currently the Yankees lead the \"Subway Series\" 71-55 all time. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1213554-yankees-mets-and-the-10-best-rivalries-in-baseball-today|title=Yankees-Mets and the 10 Best Rivalries in Baseball Today|last=Rymer|first=Zachary|date=|website=Bleacher Report|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===2000 World Series===\n{{main article|2000 World Series}}\nThe name \"Subway Series\" was commonly applied to the [[2000 World Series]] between the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[New York Mets]]. The Yankees won four games to one and celebrated their 26th championship in front of Mets fans at Shea Stadium. This was the only time that visiting teams had ever won a World Series at Shea Stadium. The other two times the World Series ended at Shea Stadium, in {{wsy|1969}} and {{wsy|1986}}, it ended with the Mets winning.\n\nDuring the 2000 World Series, the City of New York decorated some of the trains that ran on the '''{{NYCS service|7}}''' train (which went to [[Shea Stadium]] in [[Queens]], home of the Mets) and '''{{NYCS service|4}}''' train (which went to [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|the old Yankee Stadium]] in the Bronx, home of the Yankees). The '''7''' trains were blue and orange and featured the Mets version of the \"NY\" logo, and the '''4''' trains were white with blue pinstripes and featured the Yankees version of the \"NY\" logo. Also, after each game in the series the city offered free subway rides home for attendees of the game.  Yankee fans displayed signs that read \"Yankees in 4 and not in 7\", predicting that the Yankees would easily dispatch the Mets in a Series sweep as opposed to a difficult, full-length Series.  The signs had the '''4''' in a dark green circle designating the number '''4''' train, and the '''7''' in a purple circle designating the number '''7''' train.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Giants\u2013Jets rivalry]]\n* [[Islanders\u2013Rangers rivalry]]\n* [[Devils\u2013Rangers rivalry]]\n* [[Knicks\u2013Nets rivalry]]\n* [[Hudson River Derby]]\n\n==Notes==\n* {{note label|TieGame|T|T}} The 1907, 1912, and 1922 World Series each included one [[Tie (draw)|tied game]].\n* {{note label|BestOf9|V|V}} The 1903, 1919, 1920, and 1921 World Series were in a [[Playoff format#Best-of-nine playoff|best-of-nine format]] (carried by the first team to win five games).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/history/postseason/mlb_ws_recaps.jsp?feature=2000 2000 Subway Series Recap on MLB.com]\n* [http://espn.go.com/classic/s/series_subway_moments.html Great Subway Series moments]\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/images/2000/10/21/sports/baseball/sseries_hist_001020_05.html History of the Subway Series from the NY Times]\n* [http://mrudolf.tripod.com/subway/ The Subway Series (and Other Inter-Urban Series)]\n* [http://sports.newsday.com/long-island/baseball/yankees-mets-subway-series/ Subway Series Yankees vs. Mets history and boxscores from Newsday]\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{New York City Subway}}\n{{Subway Series}}\n{{New York Yankees}}\n{{New York Mets}}\n{{San Francisco Giants}}\n{{Los Angeles Dodgers}}\n{{Major League Baseball on NBC}}\n{{Navboxes|title = Championship Navigation Boxes|list1=\n{{1921 New York Giants}}\n{{1922 New York Giants}}\n{{1923 New York Yankees}}\n{{1936 New York Yankees}}\n{{1937 New York Yankees}}\n{{1941 New York Yankees}}\n{{1947 New York Yankees}}\n{{1949 New York Yankees}}\n{{1951 New York Yankees}}\n{{1952 New York Yankees}}\n{{1953 New York Yankees}}\n{{1955 Brooklyn Dodgers}}\n{{1956 New York Yankees}}\n{{2000 New York Yankees}}\n}}\n{{MLB rivalries}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Baseball in New York City]]\n[[Category:Brooklyn Dodgers]]\n[[Category:New York Yankees]]\n[[Category:New York Giants (NL)]]\n[[Category:New York Mets]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball rivalries]]\n[[Category:Interleague play]]\n[[Category:Sports in the New York metropolitan area]]\n[[Category:1921 establishments in New York (state)]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the ice hockey tournament|Subway Super Series}}\n{{Infobox sports rivalry\n| name = Subway Series\n| image = [[File:161st Street Yankee Stadium IRT Jerome southbound platform 2009 Yankee Stadium.JPG|300px]]\n| caption = The view of [[Yankee Stadium]] from the adjacent [[New York City Subway]] station;

Previously, this applied to the Giants and Dodgers as well, before they moved out of New York City. Every historic and current venue for such games has been accessible via the [[New York City Subway]], hence the name of the series.\n\nThe term's historic usage has been in reference to [[World Series]] games played between the city's teams. The [[New York Yankees]] have appeared in all Subway Series games as they have been the only [[American League]] (AL) team based in the city, and have compiled an 11\u20133 all-time series record in the 14 championship Subway Series.\n\nSince 1997, the term '''Subway Series''' has been applied to [[interleague play]] during the regular season between the Yankees and New York City's [[National League]] (NL) team: the [[New York Mets]]. The Mets and Yankees also played each other in the [[2000 World Series]], in which the Yankees won.\n\n==19th century Trolley Series==\n{{main article|1889 World Series}}\n{{see also|Dodgers\u2013Giants rivalry}}\nAlthough organized games between all-stars from New York teams against all-stars from Brooklyn teams date back to the 1850s, the first actual New York-Brooklyn \"[[World Series|World Championship Series]]\" occurred in 1889, a full nine years before Brooklyn was incorporated into the City of New York by the Greater New York Act of 1898, when the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] squared off against (and defeated) the [[Brooklyn Bridegrooms]], also called the \"[[Trolley dodger|Trolley Dodgers]]\", of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]]. The following season, Brooklyn withdrew from the Association and joined the League, setting the stage for many future intra-city competitions.\n\nSome{{who|date=July 2015}} might argue that the 1889 Series would qualify as a \"Trolley Series\", but would not qualify as a Subway Series since [[Early history of the IRT subway|New York's subway did not open until 1904]].\n\nThe [[1906 World Series]] between the Chicago Cubs and the Chicago White Sox is also loosely referred to as a Subway Series, though the term Crosstown Series is more commonly used. The term is also inaccurate, since Chicago had surface systems from 1892 till the building of the State Street Subway in 1943.\n\n==Early and mid-20th century Subway Series==\nBy the 1920s, the [[New York City Subway|subway]] had become an important form of public transport in the city and provided a convenient form of travel between the three city ballparks: the [[Polo Grounds]], in upper [[Manhattan]]; [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], in [[the Bronx]]; and [[Ebbets Field]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The 155th Street [[155th Street (IRT Ninth Avenue Line)|elevated]] and [[155th Street (IND Concourse Line)|subway]] stations, the [[161st Street \u2013 Yankee Stadium (New York City Subway)|161st Street]] station, and the [[Prospect Park (BMT Brighton Line)|Prospect Park]]<nowiki/> respectively, served the ballparks. (New York's subway and elevated systems\u2014the [[Interborough Rapid Transit Company|IRT]], [[Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company|BRT]]/[[Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation|BMT]], and [[Independent Subway System|IND]]\u2014were in competition with each other until 1940.)\n\nIn the case of the World Series contests listed, the entire Series could be attended by using the subway. The date of the first usage of the term \"Subway Series\" is uncertain. The term \"Nickel Series\" (a nickel was the [[New York City transit fares#Fare history|old subway fare]]) appeared in newspapers by 1927, and \"Subway Series\" appeared by 1928.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/subway_series/]</ref> \"Subway Series\" was clearly already a familiar concept by 1934, as discussed in this article about that year's All-Star Game to be held in New York, discussing the \"subway series\" possibility for the Giants and Yankees. (Ultimately, no New York team made it to the 1934 post-season.).<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=New York Times|title=Terry and Cronin Select Squads For All-Star Game Here Tuesday|date=July 4, 1934|agency=Associated Press|page=21}}</ref>\n\n===Yankees\u2013Giants===\n{{main article|1921 World Series|1922 World Series|1923 World Series|1936 World Series|1937 World Series|1951 World Series|Giants\u2013Yankees rivalry}}\nThe 1921 and 1922 match-ups were played in a single ballpark, as both the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|Giants]] and Yankees then played at the Polo Grounds. The Giants won both of these World Series against the Yankees, the first two Subway Series played. Despite cordial relations just a few years before when the Yankees allowed the Giants to share their home at [[Hilltop Park]] for a year in 1911 and the Giants more than returning the favor in kind by sharing Polo Grounds with the Yankees since 1913, the Yankees were issued an eviction notice in mid-1920 ending their lease after the 1922 season. The Yankees opened their new ballpark in 1923. Fortunes changed immediately for the Yankees as they defeated the Giants this time in the third straight year of World Series competition between the two teams. Their new home would host the Yankees' first of 11 Subway World Series victories that year and first of an unprecedented 26 World Series until the stadium closed in 2008.\n\nThe venues for the 1923, 1936, 1937, and 1951 World Series&mdash;the Polo Grounds and [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|the old Yankee Stadium]]&mdash;were a short walk apart across the [[Macombs Dam Bridge]] over the [[Harlem River]]. <!--Of course, anyone in the city not living in that vicinity could have opted for the subway system.-->\n\n===Yankees\u2013Dodgers===\n{{main article|1941 World Series|1947 World Series|1949 World Series|1952 World Series|1953 World Series|1955 World Series|1956 World Series|Dodgers\u2013Yankees rivalry}}\nThe term was used again in 1941 when the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Dodgers]] made their first [[World Series]] appearance since 1920. Multiple Hall of Famers took part in these contests between the \"Bronx Bombers\" and \"Dem Bums from Brooklyn\" and the games involved numerous achievements including [[Jackie Robinson]] breaking the color barrier as the first African-American baseball player in the World Series and [[Don Larsen]]'s performance in pitching the only [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] in post-season history. The seven matchups between the Yankees and the Dodgers between 1941 and 1956 cemented the term as being mostly associated with the New York vs. Brooklyn contests, during the time when New York City

to the five World Series played between the Yankees and Giants before 1940, the two teams also played exhibition series against each other from time to time. The match-ups were known as the \"City Series\" and were sometimes played in October while other teams played in the World Series.  However, after 1940, this became difficult because the Yankees would routinely appear in the World Series. In the 17 years from 1941 to 1957 (after which the Giants and Dodgers left New York City for California), the Yankees appeared in the World Series 12 times, failing to reach the Series only in 1944, 1945, 1946, 1948, and 1954.\n\nBefore New York's two National League teams left the city, the Yankees and Dodgers played an annual midseason exhibition game called the Mayor's Trophy Game to benefit sandlot baseball in New York City. The proceeds raised by the Yankees were given to leagues in Manhattan and the Bronx, while proceeds raised by the Dodgers went to leagues on Long Island and Staten Island.  The annual charity event was discontinued following the 1957 season, when the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles and the Giants moved to San Francisco. leaving the Yankees as the only major league team in the city. The game was revived in 1963, after the National League returned to New York with the expansion New York Mets in 1962.  After dwindling interest and public bickering between the owners of both teams, the Mayor's Trophy Game was discontinued following the 1983 season. It was revived again as a pre-[[Opening Day]] series titled the \"Mayor's Challenge\" and held in 1989.\n\n==Modern usage==\n[[File:Subway Series 2008.jpg|thumb|250px|Subway Series 2008, [[Johnny Damon]] with the Yankees (left) and [[Brian Schneider]] with the Mets]]\n[[File:Subway Series 2009.jpg|thumb|250px|A full house at the new [[Yankee Stadium]] for a Subway Series game against the Mets on June 13, 2009. The Mets won the game 6-2.]]\n{{see also|Mets\u2013Yankees rivalry}}\n\nIn modern usage, the term \"Subway Series\" generally refers to a series played between the two current New York baseball teams, the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[New York Mets]]. Their stadiums remain directly accessible by subway: [[Yankee Stadium]] via the [[161st Street\u2013Yankee Stadium (IRT Jerome Avenue Line)|161st Street\u2013Yankee Stadium]] station, and [[Citi Field]] via the [[Mets\u2013Willets Point (IRT Flushing Line)|Mets\u2013Willets Point]] station. It can also refer to any time two New York City-based teams play each other, such as the [[New York Knicks|Knicks]] and [[Brooklyn Nets|Nets]] in the [[NBA]], and the [[New York Rangers|Rangers]] and [[New York Islanders|Islanders]] in the [[NHL]]. All of these teams' venues are easily accessible via the New York City Subway as well.\n\n===2000 World Series===\n{{main article|2000 World Series}}\nThe name \"Subway Series\" was commonly applied to the [[2000 World Series]] between the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[New York Mets]]. The Yankees won four games to one and celebrated their 26th championship in front of Mets fans at Shea Stadium. This was the only time that visiting teams had ever won a World Series at Shea Stadium. The other two times the World Series ended at Shea Stadium, in {{wsy|1969}} and {{wsy|1986}}, it ended with the Mets winning.\n\nDuring the 2000 World Series, the City of New York decorated some of the trains that ran on the '''{{NYCS service|7}}''' train (which went to [[Shea Stadium]] in [[Queens]], home of the Mets) and '''{{NYCS service|4}}''' train (which went to [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|the old Yankee Stadium]] in the Bronx, home of the Yankees). The '''7''' trains were blue and orange and featured the Mets version of the \"NY\" logo, and the '''4''' trains were white with blue pinstripes and featured the Yankees version of the \"NY\" logo. Also, after each game in the series the city offered free subway rides home for attendees of the game.  Yankee fans displayed signs that read \"Yankees in 4 and not in 7\", predicting that the Yankees would easily dispatch the Mets in a Series sweep as opposed to a difficult, full-length Series.  The signs had the '''4''' in a dark green circle designating the number '''4''' train, and the '''7''' in a purple circle designating the number '''7''' train.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Giants\u2013Jets rivalry]]\n* [[Islanders\u2013Rangers rivalry]]\n* [[Devils\u2013Rangers rivalry]]\n* [[Knicks\u2013Nets rivalry]]\n* [[Hudson River Derby]]\n\n==Notes==\n* {{note label|TieGame|T|T}} The 1907, 1912, and 1922 World Series each included one [[Tie (draw)|tied game]].\n* {{note label|BestOf9|V|V}} The 1903, 1919, 1920, and 1921 World Series were in a [[Playoff format#Best-of-nine playoff|best-of-nine format]] (carried by the first team to win five games).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/history/postseason/mlb_ws_recaps.jsp?feature=2000 2000 Subway Series Recap on MLB.com]\n* [http://espn.go.com/classic/s/series_subway_moments.html Great Subway Series moments]\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/images/2000/10/21/sports/baseball/sseries_hist_001020_05.html History of the Subway Series from the NY Times]\n* [http://mrudolf.tripod.com/subway/ The Subway Series (and Other Inter-Urban Series)]\n* [http://sports.newsday.com/long-island/baseball/yankees-mets-subway-series/ Subway Series Yankees vs. Mets history and boxscores from Newsday]\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{New York City Subway}}\n{{Subway Series}}\n{{New York Yankees}}\n{{New York Mets}}\n{{San Francisco Giants}}\n{{Los Angeles Dodgers}}\n{{Major League Baseball on NBC}}\n{{Navboxes|title = Championship Navigation Boxes|list1=\n{{1921 New York Giants}}\n{{1922 New York Giants}}\n{{1923 New York Yankees}}\n{{1936 New York Yankees}}\n{{1937 New York Yankees}}\n{{1941 New York Yankees}}\n{{1947 New York Yankees}}\n{{1949 New York Yankees}}\n{{1951 New York Yankees}}\n{{1952 New York Yankees}}\n{{1953 New York Yankees}}\n{{1955 Brooklyn Dodgers}}\n{{1956 New York Yankees}}\n{{2000 New York Yankees}}\n}}\n{{MLB rivalries}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Baseball in New York City]]\n[[Category:Brooklyn Dodgers]]\n[[Category:New York Yankees]]\n[[Category:New York Giants (NL)]]\n[[Category:New York Mets]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball rivalries]]\n[[Category:Interleague play]]\n[[Category:Sports in the New York metropolitan area]]\n[[Category:1921 establishments in New York (state)]]\n", "name_user": "Willster777", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eModern usage:Adding a little more information on the Mets-Yankees rivalry", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series"}
