After the [[Second World War]] the family moved to [[Barton-upon-Humber]] in [[Lincolnshire]]. He had a strict upbringing and his parents did not want their son to go to art school, but his English teacher [[Henry Treece]], recognising his creative talents in writing and art, persuaded them not to stand in his way. Lewis attended [[Hull Art School]]<ref>https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/analysis/hull-noir-shedding-light-on-the-dark-side-of-life-1-8845612</ref> for four years.\n\n==Career==\nLewis's first work was in London, in advertising, and then as an animation specialist in television and films (among them the Beatles' ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'').<ref> https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/observations/2018/01/godfather-brit-noir-cult-crime-writer-ted-lewis-due-renaissance</ref> His first novel, ''[[All the Way Home and All the Night Through]]'', was published in 1965, followed by ''[[Jack's Return Home]]'', subsequently retitled ''[[Get Carter]]'' after the success of the film of the same name starring [[Michael Caine]], which created the noir school of British crime writing and pushed Lewis into the best-seller list.
