The team was led by [[Lincoln Riley]], in his third year as head coach. They played their home games at [[Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma]]. They are a charter member of the [[Big 12 Conference football|Big 12 Conference]].\n\nOklahoma began the year ranked fourth in the [[AP Poll]] and were the overwhelming favorites to repeat as Big 12 Conference champions. The Sooners won their first seven games of the season before being upset on the road by [[2019 Kansas State Wildcats football team|Kansas State]]. On November 16, Oklahoma overcame a 25-point deficit to beat previously-undefeated [[2019 Baylor Bears football team|Baylor]], 34\u201331. Oklahoma finished conference play tied with Baylor for the best record in the conference with an 8\u20131 record, earning them each a spot in the [[2019 Big 12 Championship Game|Big 12 Championship Game]]. There, they defeated Baylor a second time, this time by a score of 30\u201323 in overtime, to win Oklahoma's fifth consecutive and 13th overall Big 12 title. In the final [[College Football Playoff]] rankings of the season, Oklahoma was ranked fourth, earning them a spot in the [[2019 Peach Bowl]], in a national semi-final game against first-seeded [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]]. This was Oklahoma's third consecutive and fourth overall CFP bid. The Sooners fell to the Tigers, 63\u201328, to end the season at 12\u20132, and were ranked seventh in the final AP Poll. \n\nThe Sooners were led on offense by quarterback [[Jalen Hurts]], a graduate transfer from [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] that had previously played in three separate College Football Playoffs with the Crimson Tide. Hurts finished in second in the conference in both passing yards and rushing yards, and led the conference with 53 total touchdowns. He finished in second in voting for the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Wide receiver [[CeeDee Lamb]] was a [[2019 College Football All-America Team|consensus All-American]]. Hurts, Lamb, and center [[Creed Humphrey]] were named [[2019 All-Big 12 Conference football team|first-team all-conference]]. On defense, the team was led by first-team all-conference linebacker [[Kenneth Murray (American football)|Kenneth Murray]].\n\n==Previous season==\nThe Sooners finished the season 12\u20131, 8\u20131 in Big 12 play. Finishing with the best record in conference play the Sooners clinched a berth in the [[2018 Big 12 Championship Game|conference championship game]] where they defeated Texas 39\u201327 to win their 12th Big 12 Championship. Oklahoma was selected as the fourth seed to play in the 2018 College Football playoff against first seed [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama Crimson Tide]] in the [[2018 Orange Bowl]], which ended up being a 34\u201345 loss.\n\n==Preseason==\n\n===Award watch lists=== \n<small>Listed in the order that they were released</small>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Oklahoma Sooners|Award|Player|Position|Year}}\n|-\n|[[Lott Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lottimpacttrophy.org/2019-watch-list/|title=2019 LOTT IMPACT TROPHY WATCH LIST CANDIDATES \u2013 Lott IMPACT Trophy|publisher=}}</ref>\n|[[Kenneth Murray (American football)|Kenneth Murray]]\n|LB\n|JR\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Maxwell Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.maxwellfootballclub.org/2019-maxwell-award-watch-list/|title=2019 Maxwell Award Watch List \u2013 Maxwell Football Club|date=15 July 2019|publisher=}}</ref>\n|[[Jalen Hurts]]\n|QB\n|GS\n|- \n|[[CeeDee Lamb]]\n|WR\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Bednarik Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.maxwellfootballclub.org/2019-bednarik-award-watch-list/|title=2019 Bednarik Award Watch List \u2013 Maxwell Football Club|date=15 July 2019|publisher=}}</ref>\n|Kenneth Murray\n|LB\n|JR \n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Fred Biletnikoff Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 Biletnikoff Award Preseason Watch List Released|url=http://biletnikoffaward.com/2019-biletnikoff-award-watch-list|date=July 18, 2019|accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|Grant Calcaterra\n|TE\n|JR\n|- \n|CeeDee Lamb\n|WR\n|JR\n|-\n|[[John Mackey Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 John Mackey Award Preseason Watch List Released|url=http://www.johnmackeyaward.com/uploads/3/4/7/9/34791900/2019_john_mackey_award_preseason_watch_list_-_final_7-18-19.pdf|date=July 19, 2019|accessdate=July 19, 2019}}</ref>\n|Grant Calcaterra\n|TE\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Rimington Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Rimington Trophy Press Release|url=http://www.rimingtontrophy.com/news/?article_id=109|date=July 19, 2019|accessdate=July 19, 2019}}</ref>\n|[[Creed Humphrey]]\n|C\n|RS SO\n|-\n|[[Butkus Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 Butkus Award Preseason Watch List Released|url=http://thebutkusaward.com/watchlist/view.aspx?t=c|date=July 22, 2019|accessdate=July 22, 2019}}</ref>\n|Kenneth Murray\n|LB\n|JR\n|- \n|rowspan=2|[[Outland Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 Outland Trophy Award Watchlist Unveiled|url=http://www.sportswriters.net/fwaa/news/2019/outland190723.html|date=July 23, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n|Creed Humphrey\n|OL\n|RS SO\n|-\n|[[Neville Gallimore (American football)|Neville Gallimore]]\n|DL\n|RS SR\n|-\n|[[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 Bronko Nagurski Trophy Watchlist Unveiled|url=http://www.sportswriters.net/fwaa/news/2019/nagurski190723.html|date=July 23, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n|Kenneth Murray\n|LB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award|Dodd Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dodd Trophy Announces 2019 Preseason Watch List|url=http://www.thedoddtrophy.com/the-dodd-trophy-announces-2019-preseason-watch-list/|date=July 25, 2019|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n| [[Lincoln Riley]]\n| HC\n| \u2013\n|-\n|[[Wuerffel Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Wuerffel Trophy Unveils 2019 Watch List|url=https://www.wuerffeltrophy.org/post/wuerffel-trophy-unveils-watch-list-for-2019|date=July 25, 2019|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|Kenneth Murray\n|LB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Walter Camp Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Walter Camp Foundation Announces 2019 Player of the Year Preseason Watch List|url=https://waltercamp.org/walter-camp-foundation-announces-2019-player-of-the-year-preseason-watch-list/|date=July 26, 2019|accessdate=July 26, 2019}}</ref>\n|Jalen Hurts \n|QB\n|GS\n|-\n|rowspan=4|[[Earl Campbell Tyler Rose Award]]\n|Kennedy Brooks\n|RB\n|RS SO\n|-\n|CeeDee Lamb\n|WR\n|JR\n|-\n|Jalen Hurts\n|QB\n|GS\n|-\n|Tanner Mordecai \n|QB\n|RS FR\n|-\n|[[Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Golden Arm Award Announces 2019 Class of Candidates|url=http://www.goldenarmfoundation.com/golden-arm-award-announces-2019-class-candidates/|date=August 19, 2019|accessdate=August 19, 2019}}</ref>\n|Jalen Hurts\n|QB\n|GS\n|}\n\n===Big 12 media days===\nThe 2019 Big 12 media days were held July 15\u201316, 2019 in [[Frisco, Texas]].

The team was led by [[Lincoln Riley]], in his third year as head coach. They played their home games at [[Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma]]. They are a charter member of the [[Big 12 Conference football|Big 12 Conference]].\n\nOklahoma began the year ranked fourth in the [[AP Poll]] and were the overwhelming favorites to repeat as Big 12 Conference champions. The Sooners won their first seven games of the season before being upset on the road by [[2019 Kansas State Wildcats football team|Kansas State]]. On November 16, Oklahoma overcame a 25-point deficit to beat previously-undefeated [[2019 Baylor Bears football team|Baylor]], 34\u201331. Oklahoma finished conference play tied with Baylor for the best record in the conference with an 8\u20131 record, earning them each a spot in the [[2019 Big 12 Championship Game|Big 12 Championship Game]]. There, they defeated Baylor a second time, this time by a score of 30\u201323 in overtime, to win Oklahoma's fifth consecutive and 13th overall Big 12 title. In the final [[College Football Playoff]] rankings of the season, Oklahoma was ranked fourth, earning them a spot in the [[2019 Peach Bowl]], in a national semi-final game against first-seeded [[2019 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]]. This was Oklahoma's third consecutive and fourth overall CFP bid. The Sooners fell to the Tigers, 63\u201328, to end the season at 12\u20132, and were ranked seventh in the final AP Poll. \n\nThe Sooners were led on offense by quarterback [[Jalen Hurts]], a graduate transfer from [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] that had previously played in three separate College Football Playoffs with the Crimson Tide. Hurts finished in second in the conference in both passing yards and rushing yards, and led the conference with 53 total touchdowns. He finished in second in voting for the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Wide receiver [[CeeDee Lamb]] was a [[2019 College Football All-America Team|consensus All-American]]. Hurts, Lamb, and center [[Creed Humphrey]] were named [[2019 All-Big 12 Conference football team|first-team all-conference]]. On defense, the team was led by first-team all-conference linebacker [[Kenneth Murray (American football)|Kenneth Murray]].\n\n==Previous season==\nThe Sooners finished the season 12\u20131, 8\u20131 in Big 12 play. Finishing with the best record in conference play the Sooners clinched a berth in the [[2018 Big 12 Championship Game|conference championship game]] where they defeated Texas 39\u201327 to win their 12th Big 12 Championship. Oklahoma was selected as the fourth seed to play in the 2018 College Football playoff against first seed [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama Crimson Tide]] in the [[2018 Orange Bowl]], which ended up being a 34\u201345 loss.\n\n==Preseason==\n\n===Award watch lists=== \n<small>Listed in the order that they were released</small>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Oklahoma Sooners|Award|Player|Position|Year}}\n|-\n|[[Lott Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lottimpacttrophy.org/2019-watch-list/|title=2019 LOTT IMPACT TROPHY WATCH LIST CANDIDATES \u2013 Lott IMPACT Trophy|publisher=}}</ref>\n|[[Kenneth Murray (American football)|Kenneth Murray]]\n|LB\n|JR\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Maxwell Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.maxwellfootballclub.org/2019-maxwell-award-watch-list/|title=2019 Maxwell Award Watch List \u2013 Maxwell Football Club|date=15 July 2019|publisher=}}</ref>\n|[[Jalen Hurts]]\n|QB\n|GS\n|- \n|[[CeeDee Lamb]]\n|WR\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Bednarik Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.maxwellfootballclub.org/2019-bednarik-award-watch-list/|title=2019 Bednarik Award Watch List \u2013 Maxwell Football Club|date=15 July 2019|publisher=}}</ref>\n|Kenneth Murray\n|LB\n|JR \n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Fred Biletnikoff Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 Biletnikoff Award Preseason Watch List Released|url=http://biletnikoffaward.com/2019-biletnikoff-award-watch-list|date=July 18, 2019|accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|Grant Calcaterra\n|TE\n|JR\n|- \n|CeeDee Lamb\n|WR\n|JR\n|-\n|[[John Mackey Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 John Mackey Award Preseason Watch List Released|url=http://www.johnmackeyaward.com/uploads/3/4/7/9/34791900/2019_john_mackey_award_preseason_watch_list_-_final_7-18-19.pdf|date=July 19, 2019|accessdate=July 19, 2019}}</ref>\n|Grant Calcaterra\n|TE\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Rimington Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Rimington Trophy Press Release|url=http://www.rimingtontrophy.com/news/?article_id=109|date=July 19, 2019|accessdate=July 19, 2019}}</ref>\n|[[Creed Humphrey]]\n|C\n|RS SO\n|-\n|[[Butkus Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 Butkus Award Preseason Watch List Released|url=http://thebutkusaward.com/watchlist/view.aspx?t=c|date=July 22, 2019|accessdate=July 22, 2019}}</ref>\n|Kenneth Murray\n|LB\n|JR\n|- \n|rowspan=2|[[Outland Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 Outland Trophy Award Watchlist Unveiled|url=http://www.sportswriters.net/fwaa/news/2019/outland190723.html|date=July 23, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n|Creed Humphrey\n|OL\n|RS SO\n|-\n|[[Neville Gallimore (American football)|Neville Gallimore]]\n|DL\n|RS SR\n|-\n|[[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2019 Bronko Nagurski Trophy Watchlist Unveiled|url=http://www.sportswriters.net/fwaa/news/2019/nagurski190723.html|date=July 23, 2019|accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n|Kenneth Murray\n|LB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award|Dodd Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dodd Trophy Announces 2019 Preseason Watch List|url=http://www.thedoddtrophy.com/the-dodd-trophy-announces-2019-preseason-watch-list/|date=July 25, 2019|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n| [[Lincoln Riley]]\n| HC\n| \u2013\n|-\n|[[Wuerffel Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Wuerffel Trophy Unveils 2019 Watch List|url=https://www.wuerffeltrophy.org/post/wuerffel-trophy-unveils-watch-list-for-2019|date=July 25, 2019|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|Kenneth Murray\n|LB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Walter Camp Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Walter Camp Foundation Announces 2019 Player of the Year Preseason Watch List|url=https://waltercamp.org/walter-camp-foundation-announces-2019-player-of-the-year-preseason-watch-list/|date=July 26, 2019|accessdate=July 26, 2019}}</ref>\n|Jalen Hurts \n|QB\n|GS\n|-\n|rowspan=4|[[Earl Campbell Tyler Rose Award]]\n|Kennedy Brooks\n|RB\n|RS SO\n|-\n|CeeDee Lamb\n|WR\n|JR\n|-\n|Jalen Hurts\n|QB\n|GS\n|-\n|Tanner Mordecai \n|QB\n|RS FR\n|-\n|[[Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=The Golden Arm Award Announces 2019 Class of Candidates|url=http://www.goldenarmfoundation.com/golden-arm-award-announces-2019-class-candidates/|date=August 19, 2019|accessdate=August 19, 2019}}</ref>\n|Jalen Hurts\n|QB\n|GS\n|}\n\n===Big 12 media days===\nThe 2019 Big 12 media days were held July 15\u201316, 2019 in [[Frisco, Texas]].

He was best known as '''Road Warrior Hawk''', one half of the [[tag team]] known as [[The Road Warriors]] (The Legion of Doom in [[WWE|WWF]]), with [[Road Warrior Animal]]. Outside The Road Warriors, Hawk was a sporadic challenger for [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world heavyweight championships]] on [[pay-per-view]] from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s. He headlined the 1993 edition of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]]'s premier annual event, [[November to Remember (1993)|November to Remember]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.profightdb.com/wrestlers/road-warrior-hawk-125.html?res=2000|title=Road Warrior Hawk: Profile & Match Listing|publisher=Internet Wrestling Database|accessdate=July 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWhile living in Minneapolis, Hegstrand attended [[Patrick Henry High School (Minneapolis)|Patrick Henry High School]] where he graduated in 1976. After high school, he had various odd jobs to make ends meet such as a butcher. An imposing figure due to his size and love of power lifting, he was a very effective bouncer. It was while working as a bouncer at Gramma B's in the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] that he caught the eye of [[Eddie Sharkey]], a well known wrestling trainer. Sharkey thought that Hegstrand, along with [[Road Warrior Animal|Joe Laurinaitis]], [[Ravishing Rick Rude|Rick Rood]] and [[Barry Darsow]] could make it big in professional wrestling.\n\n==Career==\n{{Main|The Road Warriors}}\nHegstrand started his career as part of the Traveling All-Stars. He was billed as \"Crusher Von Haig\" and wrestled in Vancouver. Hawk soon grew weary of the road and would become homesick. He traveled back home with another Sharkey trainee, [[Rick Rude]]. In 1983 fate struck these two again. Animal's partner for the night would find himself in legal trouble. Needing a quick replacement, Ole Anderson gave Hawk a call. They would be paired together again, this time as tag team partners. Anderson gave them the name the '''Road Warriors'''. Neither man knew at the time that they would make wrestling history that day.<ref>{{cite news |author=Matthew Hester(Senior Writer) |title= C Vs. C: The Road Warriors Were the Greatest Tag Team in Pro Wrestling!|publisher=Bleacher Report |year=2010 }}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Paul Ellering]] was looking to put together a stable of heels in [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] called The Legion of Doom it was decided to pair Laurinaitis with Hegstrand and change their names to \"Animal\" and \"Hawk\" respectively; thus, [[The Road Warriors]] were born. To look more intimidating the two shaved their heads into Mohawks and started wearing studded dog collars, leather chaps, and face paint. The look and name was taken from ''[[Mad Max 2|Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior]]'', helping to paint the two as no-mercy monsters. Their [[Promo (professional wrestling)|interview]] style was vicious, yet charismatic and a bit humorous.  Hawk was known for often beginning his promos with his trademark yell of \"WELLLLLLLLLLLLLL!...\" and ending with his [[catchphrase|catch phrase]] of \"OOOOOOOOOH, WHAT A RUUUUUUUUUUUUSH!\"<ref name=\"Tag\">{{cite book |author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson |title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams |publisher=ECW Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-55022-683-6}}</ref>\n\nThe team was an instant hit, revolutionizing the tag-team scene with their power moves, no mercy attitudes, and innovative face paint that would spawn many future imitators in wrestling.<ref name=\"LODDVD\">{{cite video|people=Various Comments:|title=Road Warriors: The Life and Death of Wrestling's Most Dominant Tag-Team|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0476485/|medium=DVD|publisher=WWE Home Video|location=USA|date=June 14, 2005}}</ref> In Georgia they won the [[NWA National Tag Team Championship]] four times<ref name=\"Titles\">{{cite book|author=Royal Duncan & Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=978-0-9698161-5-7}}</ref> before moving on to bigger promotions such as the [[American Wrestling Association]] in the US and [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] in Japan, winning tag-team titles wherever they went.<ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\n===National Wrestling Alliance / World Championship Wrestling (1986&ndash;1990)===\nTheir hard hitting style, no nonsense attitude, and winning ways made the Road Warriors fan favorites wherever they went; even when they were booked as heels, the fans refused to boo them.<ref name=\"LODDVD\"/> They were so in demand that they started to split their time between the AWA and the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] until finally leaving the AWA for big money contracts with the NWA and a huge push for the monster duo.<ref name=\"Tag\"/> The move paid off instantly as they won the inaugural [[Jim Crockett, Sr. Memorial Cup Tag Team Tournament]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/cup.html#1st|title=NWA Crockett Cup Results (1986)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|author=prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref> and feuded with the top stars of the NWA such as [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]]<ref name=\"WG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/gabash.html#87|title=NWA Great American Bash Results (1987 #1)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|author=prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/gabash.html#87b|title=NWA Great American Bash Results (1987 #2)|accessdate=April 17, 2007|author=prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/gabash.html#87c | title = NWA Great American Bash Results (1987 #3) | accessdate = April 17, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/starrcad.html#87 | title = NWA Starrcade Results (1987) | accessdate = April 17, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref> and [[The Russian Team]] (which included the Road Warriors\u2019 old training buddy Barry Darsow, then wrestling as Krusher Khrushchev).<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/gabash.html#86 | title = NWA Great American Bash Results (1986) | accessdate = April 17, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/nwaawa.html#1285 | title = NWA/AWA Star Wars Results (December 1985) | accessdate = April 17, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/nwaawa.html#0286 | title = NWA/AWA Star Wars Results (1986) | accessdate = April 17, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref> During their initial run in the Mid-Atlantic region of the NWA, they helped popularize the [[WarGames match]],<ref name=\"WG\"/> the [[Professional wrestling match types#Scaffold match|Scaffold match]],<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/starrcad.html#86 | title = NWA Starrcade Results (1986) | accessdate = April 17, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref> and their trademark [[Professional wrestling match types#Hardcore-based variations|Chicago Street Fight]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/w-war.html#90 | title = NWA Wrestle War Results (1990) | accessdate = April 17, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988 the Road Warriors engaged in a violent feud with [[The Powers of Pain]] ([[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]] and [[The Warlord (wrestler)|The Warlord]]), the first team that could truly match the Road Warriors in power (and who were one of the most well known Road Warrior clones).

When Animal suffered a severe back injury a short while later, everyone thought it was the end of the legendary team.\n\n===Japan and Independents (1992&ndash;1995)===\nHawk competed as a singles wrestler in Europe and Japan and although he won nearly every singles match he competed in, he was usually seen (by North American and Japanese fans at least) as a tag team wrestler. Thus, he always fought either mid-card opponents or made teams with better-known singles stars. When he joined [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] he was immediately paired with [[Kensuke Sasaki]], then simply known as a good mid-carder, as the Hell Raisers (Sasaki adopting the face paint and gimmick Power Warrior).<ref name=\"Tag\"/> The two dominated NJPW's tag team ranks for a while through their two wins of the [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]],<ref name=\"Titles\"/> but no North American promoter thought about bringing them as a team, due to Sasaki's affiliation with NJPW. As a singles wrestler, Hawk found success in [[Europe]], winning the CWA World Heavyweight Championship.<ref name=\"Titles\"/>\n\nHawk also competed in NWA Eastern Championship Wrestling, the progenitor of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], in 1993.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hardcore History|last=Williams|first=Scott|page=19|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2006|isbn=978-1-59670-021-5}}</ref>\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1993, 1995&ndash;1996)===\nIn August 1993 Hawk made sporadic appearances in [[World Championship Wrestling]] as a mystery partner of [[Dustin Rhodes]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXIV | title = WCW Clash of the Champions Results (XXIV) | accessdate = April 17, 2007 | author = prowrestlinghistory.com | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080421024241/http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/clash2.html#XXIV | archivedate = April 21, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> and later as a replacement partner when [[Davey Boy Smith]] left the federation<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wcw/starrcad.html#93 | title = WCW Starrcade Results (1993) | accessdate = April 17, 2007| author = prowrestlinghistory.com}}</ref> but nothing permanent ever came of it, and Hawk left after Starrcade in December 1993.

Hawk returned in January 1996, but this time, he also brought Animal back with him as his back had finally recovered enough for him to return to active competition.

During the match, The New Age Outlaws attacked L.O.D. and shaved off one of Hawk's mohawks, and threw Animal through the announcers table.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful challenges the L.O.D. were repackaged as '''Legion of Doom 2000''' with manager [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Sunny]], although she did not stay with the team for long.<ref name=\"Tag\"/>\n\nDuring [[the Attitude Era]], in which the WWF moved towards a more \"adult\" product, the Legion of Doom was placed into a storyline incorporating Hegstrand's real-life drug addiction and [[alcoholism]], against the wishes of both Hegstrand and Laurinaitis.<ref name=\"WrestleCrap\"/> The storyline found the Legion of Doom crumbling as Hawk repeatedly showed up to matches apparently drunk or under the influence of drugs, and began demonstrating [[Suicidal ideation|suicidal tendencies]]. In order to stabilize the team, a third member, [[Darren Drozdov|Puke]], was introduced. This led to the conclusion of the storyline, in which a suicidal Hawk climbed to the top of the TitanTron, the giant television monitor erected during episodes of WWF's ''Raw Is War'' to show match highlights to fans in attendance. Puke, supposedly attempting to rescue Hawk, climbed after him, only to apparently throw Hawk over the side (with a special effect being used to make it appear as though fans could see Hegstrand's body plunging a fatal distance behind the screen); Puke then revealed that he had been enabling Hawk's drug addiction in order to kill him and take his place in the Legion of Doom. Being forced to act out Hegstrand's personal demons onscreen eventually proved too much for both Hegstrand and Laurinaitis, and both men quit the company shortly after the \"Puke killed Hawk\" incident.<ref name=\"WrestleCrap\"/>\n\n===Post-WWF and independent circuit (1999&ndash;2003) ===\nWhile the Road Warriors never officially broke up, Animal started making an increasing number of solo appearances after they left the WWF as Hegstrand struggled with drug and alcohol addiction and generally did not appear at many wrestling shows during this time.<ref name=\"LODDVD\"/> In 2001, Hegstrand was diagnosed with [[cardiomyopathy]], a heart condition that stopped him from wrestling for a short while. He was able to overcome its effects and returned to a regular working schedule later on.\n\nOn June 22, 2002 International Wrestling Superstars, Road Warriors Animal & Hawk defeated the Headshrinkers for the World Tag-Team Championship. That victory also led to Team USA winning the International Tournament held in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\nLaurinaitis and Hegstrand became [[Born again Christianity|born-again Christian]]s in 2003 and appeared at a number of Christian wrestling events run by [[Ted DiBiase]] and [[Nikita Koloff]] hoping to reignite their tag-team career.

At the time of his death, Hawk and Animal were working on a book about their careers.\n\nAnimal returned to WWE in mid-2005 and decided to dedicate his entire run to Hegstrand, including his tag team title victory with [[Jon Heidenreich|Heidenreich]] at [[The Great American Bash (2005)|The Great American Bash]].\n\nOn the March 28, 2011 episode of ''Raw'', it was announced that the Road Warriors would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2011.

He was best known as '''Road Warrior Hawk''', one half of the [[tag team]] known as [[The Road Warriors]] (The Legion of Doom in [[WWE|WWF]]), with [[Road Warrior Animal]]. Outside The Road Warriors, Hawk was a sporadic challenger for [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world heavyweight championships]] on [[pay-per-view]] from the late 1980s to the mid 1990s. He headlined the 1993 edition of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]]'s premier annual event, [[November to Remember (1993)|November to Remember]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.profightdb.com/wrestlers/road-warrior-hawk-125.html?res=2000|title=Road Warrior Hawk: Profile & Match Listing|publisher=Internet Wrestling Database|accessdate=July 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWhile living in Minneapolis, Hegstrand attended [[Patrick Henry High School (Minneapolis)|Patrick Henry High School]] where he graduated in 1976. After high school, he had various odd jobs to make ends meet such as a butcher. An imposing figure due to his size and love of power lifting, he was a very effective bouncer. It was while working as a bouncer at Gramma B's in the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] that he caught the eye of [[Eddie Sharkey]], a well known wrestling trainer. Sharkey thought that Hegstrand, along with [[Road Warrior Animal|Joe Laurinaitis]], [[Ravishing Rick Rude|Rick Rood]] and [[Barry Darsow]] could make it big in professional wrestling.\n\n==Career==\n{{Main|The Road Warriors}}\nHegstrand started his career as part of the Traveling All-Stars. He was billed as \"Crusher Von Haig\" and wrestled in Vancouver. Hawk soon grew weary of the road and would become homesick. He traveled back home with another Sharkey trainee, [[Rick Rude]]. In 1983 fate struck these two again. Animal's partner for the night would find himself in legal trouble. Needing a quick replacement, Ole Anderson gave Hawk a call. They would be paired together again, this time as tag team partners. Anderson gave them the name the '''Road Warriors'''. Neither man knew at the time that they would make wrestling history that day.<ref>{{cite news |author=Matthew Hester(Senior Writer) |title= C Vs. C: The Road Warriors Were the Greatest Tag Team in Pro Wrestling!|publisher=Bleacher Report |year=2010 }}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Paul Ellering]] was looking to put together a stable of heels in [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] called The Legion of Doom it was decided to pair Laurinaitis with Hegstrand and change their names to \"Animal\" and \"Hawk\" respectively; thus, [[The Road Warriors]] were born. To look more intimidating the two shaved their heads into Mohawks and started wearing studded dog collars, leather chaps, and face paint.

When Animal suffered a severe back injury a short while later, everyone thought it was the end of the legendary team.\n\n===Japan and Independents (1992&ndash;1995)===\nHawk competed as a singles wrestler in Europe and Japan and although he won nearly every singles match he competed in, he was usually seen (by North American and Japanese fans at least) as a tag team wrestler. Thus, he always fought either mid-card opponents or made teams with better-known singles stars. When he joined [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] he was immediately paired with [[Kensuke Sasaki]], then simply known as a good mid-carder, as the Hell Raisers (Sasaki adopting the face paint and gimmick Power Warrior).<ref name=\"Tag\"/> The two dominated NJPW's tag team ranks for a while through their two wins of the [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]],<ref name=\"Titles\"/> but no North American promoter thought about bringing them as a team, due to Sasaki's affiliation with NJPW.

Hawk returned in January 1996, but this time, he also brought Animal back with him as his back had finally recovered enough for him to return to active competition.

In order to stabilize the team, a third member, [[Darren Drozdov|Puke]], was introduced. This led to the conclusion of the storyline, in which a suicidal Hawk climbed to the top of the TitanTron, the giant television monitor erected during episodes of WWF's ''Raw Is War'' to show match highlights to fans in attendance. Puke, supposedly attempting to rescue Hawk, climbed after him, only to apparently throw Hawk over the side (with a special effect being used to make it appear as though fans could see Hegstrand's body plunging a fatal distance behind the screen); Puke then revealed that he had been enabling Hawk's drug addiction in order to kill him and take his place in the Legion of Doom. Being forced to act out Hegstrand's personal demons onscreen eventually proved too much for both Hegstrand and Laurinaitis, and both men quit the company shortly after the \"Puke killed Hawk\" incident.<ref name=\"WrestleCrap\"/>\n\n===Post-WWF and independent circuit (1999&ndash;2003) ===\nWhile the Road Warriors never officially broke up, Animal started making an increasing number of solo appearances after they left the WWF as Hegstrand struggled with drug and alcohol addiction and generally did not appear at many wrestling shows during this time.<ref name=\"LODDVD\"/> In 2001, Hegstrand was diagnosed with [[cardiomyopathy]], a heart condition that stopped him from wrestling for a short while. He was able to overcome its effects and returned to a regular working schedule later on.\n\nOn June 22, 2002 International Wrestling Superstars, Road Warriors Animal & Hawk defeated the Headshrinkers for the World Tag-Team Championship. That victory also led to Team USA winning the International Tournament held in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\nLaurinaitis and Hegstrand became [[Born again Christianity|born-again Christian]]s in 2003 and appeared at a number of Christian wrestling events run by [[Ted DiBiase]] and [[Nikita Koloff]] hoping to reignite their tag-team career. They also appeared in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] in late 2002 and early 2003 as part of a group that opposed [[Vince Russo]]\u2019s faction [[Sports Entertainment Xtreme]] but only wrestled one actual match for the company.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.tnawrestling.com/info/quickresults/weeklyppv/2003.html| title = TNA Weekly PPV Results 2003| accessdate = April 17, 2007| author = tnawrestling.com| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070127124150/http://www.tnawrestling.com/info/quickresults/weeklyppv/2003.html| archivedate = January 27, 2007| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAnimal and Hawk made a surprise appearance on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' on May 12, 2003 when they took on [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] and [[Rob Van Dam]] for the World Tag Team Championship.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/03.htm | title = WWE Show Results 2003| accessdate = April 17, 2007 | author = Graham Cawthon | quote = (May 12, 2003) WWE Raw Tag Team Champions Rob Van Dam & Kane defeated the Legion of Doom when RVD pinned Road Warrior Hawk following the chokeslam / Five Star Frog Splash combo (LOD\u2019s surprise return after more than a 4-year absence)}}</ref> Although Hawk and Animal came up short in their attempt to become three-time champions, it was clear that Hawk had defeated the demons that had once kept him from competing, and the Road Warriors had hopes of returning to WWE.\n\nLater in 2003, Hawk made an appearance with the All World Wrestling League, a take-off of the 'original' Big Time Wrestling that was owned by [[Ed Farhat|The Original Sheik]] who died earlier that year; it was run by the sons of The Sheik, Eddie and Tom Farhat. They decided to book Hawk for an event in Holt, Michigan; that event was the second to last time Hawk wrestled.

The novella tells the story of a utopian city called Omelas, whose citizens\u2019 happiness depends on the ongoing suffering of a single child. The video suggests through imagery including the name Omelas, that the members are among those who, once enlightened to the suffering, walk away from Omelas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OgqonNzFQwU|title=BTS The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas - A Short Story}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the video, multiple members are seen walking around different places.

Everything about \u201cSpring Day\u201d plucks cruelly at a taut nerve: the lyrics that vivisect loss, the motifs of remembrance, and the looming spectre of something sinister in the video. All of this leads to the bittersweet moment of the boys reuniting, when they finally move on together.

The terrain is mountainous and inaccessible (until recently many Mani villages could be accessed only by sea), and the regional name \"Mani\" is thought to have meant originally \"dry\" or \"barren\". The name \"Maniot\" is a derivative meaning \"of Mani\". In the [[early modern period]], Maniots had a reputation as fierce and proudly independent [[warrior]]s, who practiced [[piracy]] and fierce [[Feud#Blood feuds/vendetta|blood feuds]]. For the most part, the Maniots lived in fortified villages (and \"house-towers\") where they defended their lands against the armies of [[William II Villehardouin]] and later against those of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n==Names==\n\nThe surnames of the Maniots uniformly end in \"eas\" in what is now the [[Messenia]]n (\"outer\" or northwestern) part of Mani, \"akis\" or \"-akos\" in what is now the [[Laconia]]n (\"inner\" or southwestern and eastern) part of Mani and the occasional \"-oggonas\" <ref name=\"Form and evolution of Maniot surnames\">[http://www.mani.org.gr/fonimanis/2001/1_2001epif_epon.htm Form and evolution of Maniot surnames], Centre for Research of Greek Folklore of the Academy of Athens (in Greek)</ref>.\n\n==Ancient Mani==\n\n===Mycenaean Mani===\n[[File:GreeceMani.png|thumb|left|Map showing the location of [[Mani Peninsula]].]]\n\n[[Homer]]'s \"[[Catalogue of Ships]]\" in the ''[[Iliad]]'' mentions the cities of Mani: Messi (Mezapos), Oetylus (Oitylo), Kardamili (or Skardamoula), Gerenia, Teuthrone (Kotronas), and Las ([[Passavas]]).<ref name=\"Homer 2.581\">Homer.

The temple was of such importance that it rivaled [[Delphi]] which was then a temple dedicated to [[Poseidon]]. Eventually, the temple of Tenaron was dedicated to Poseidon and the temple at Delphi was dedicated to Apollo. According to other legends, there is a cave near [[Tenaro]] that leads to [[Hades]].

The conflict resulted in the destruction of [[Corinth]] by the forces of [[Lucius Mummius Achaicus]] and the annexation of the [[Achaean League]] by the [[Roman Republic]]. Even though the Romans conquered the Peloponnese, the Koinon was allowed to retain its independence. The Maniots suffered from pirate raids by Cretans and [[Cilicia]]ns who plundered Mani and pillaged the temple of [[Poseidon]]. The Maniots were delivered from the pirates when [[Pompey the Great]] defeated them. Most probably in gratitude, the Maniots supplied Pompey with archers in his battles against [[Julius Caesar]] during [[Caesar's civil war]] (49\u201345 BC) and were defeated.<ref name=\"Kassis16\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=16}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Civil war between Antony and Octavian]] (32\u201330 BC), the Maniots and the rest of the Laconians supplied [[Augustus]] with troops for his confrontation with [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] (September 2, 31 BC) and in gratitude they officially recognized Augustus as Emperor and invited him at [[Psamathous]] (near modern [[Porto Kagio]]), and their Koinon stayed an independent state.

His eldest son, [[Arcadius]], succeeded him in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], while his younger son, [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], received the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The Roman Empire had divided for the last time, and Mani became part of the Eastern or [[Byzantine Empire]].

The Maniots at that time were called \"Hellenes\"\u2014that is, [[paganism|pagans]] (see [[Names of the Greeks]])\u2014and were only [[Christianization|Christianized]] fully in the 9th century AD, though some church ruins from the 4th century AD indicate that [[Christianity]] was practiced by some Maniots in the region at an earlier time. The Maniots were the last inhabitants of Greece to openly follow the pagan [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] religion. This can be explained by the mountainous nature of Mani's terrain, which enabled them to escape the attempts of the Eastern Roman Empire to Christianize Greece by force.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22\"/>\n\n===Under the Principality of Achaea===\n[[File:Armoiries Acha\u00efe.svg|thumb|left|100px|Coat of Arms of the [[Principality of Achaea]].]]\n\nDuring the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1201\u20131204), the Crusaders captured [[Constantinople]]. The Eastern Roman Empire was partitioned between several Greek and Latin successor states, notably including (from west to east) the [[Despotate of Epirus]], the [[Latin Empire]], the [[Empire of Nicaea]], and the [[Empire of Trebizond]]. These four empires produced rival emperors, struggling for control over each other and the rest of the semi-independent states emerging in the area. [[William of Champlitte]] and [[Geoffrey I Villehardouin]] defeated the Peloponnesian Greeks at the [[Battle of the Olive Grove of Koundouros]] (1205), and the Peloponnese became the [[Principality of Achaea]]. In 1210, Mani was given to Baron Jean de Neuilly as Hereditary Marshal, and he built the castle of [[Passavas]] on the ruins of [[Las (Greece)|Las]]. The castle occupied a significant position, as it controlled an important pass from Gythium to [[Oitylo]] and contained the Maniots.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos23\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=23}}.</ref><ref name=\"Kassis23\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=23}}.</ref>\n\nThe Maniots, however, were not easily contained, and they were not the only threat to the Frankish occupation of the Peloponnese. The [[Melingoi|Melengi]], a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribe in the [[Taygetus]] [[mountain range]], raided Laconia from the west, and the [[Tsakonians]] also resisted the Franks. In 1249, the new prince, [[William II of Villehardouin]], acted against the raiders. He used the newly captured fortress of [[Monemvasia]] to keep the Tsakonians at bay, and he built the castle at [[Mystras]] in the Taygetus mountains overlooking Sparta in order to contain the Melengi. To stop the Maniot raids, he built the castle of [[Megali Maina]], which is most probably [[Tigani]]. It is described as ''at a fearful cliff with a headland above''. A Latin bishop was appointed for Mani during the 1250s. In 1259, the bishop was captured during the [[Battle of Pelagonia]] by the renewed Byzantine Empire under the leadership of Nicaea.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=24}}.</ref>\n\n===Under the Despotate of Morea===\n[[File:Despotate of Morea 1450.svg|thumb|[[Despotate of Morea]], c. 1450.]]\n\nOn July 25, 1261, the Byzantines under [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] recaptured Constantinople. Prince William was set free, on the condition that he had to surrender the fortresses of Megali Maina, Mystras, [[Geronthrae]] and Monemvasia, as well as surrender hostages including [[Lady Margaret, Baroness of Passavas]]. With the Franks gone from Laconia, the Maniots lived in peace under the [[Despotate of Morea]], whose successive [[Despotes]] governed the province. Mani seems to have been dominated by the Nikliani family, who were refugees. However, the peace was terminated when the Ottoman Turks started their attacks on the Peloponnese.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24\"/>{{refn|group=Note|name=cnote\u03b1|In the second period of Byzantine rule over Mani, there were four social castes, the Nikliani, the Megalogenites, the Achamnomeri and the Fameyi.

In May 1460, Mehmet occupied the Peloponnese. The Despotate of Morea had been ruled by the two brothers of [[Constantine XI]], who had died defending Constantinople. However, neither [[Demetrios Palaiologos]] nor [[Thomas Palaiologos]] chose to follow his example and defend the Peloponnese. Instead, Thomas fled to [[Italy]], while Demetrios sought refuge with Mehmet.

In 1700, 14,773 people were recorded in the census despite the constant migrations in Mani. In 1805, [[William Martin Leake]] recorded that there were 30,000 people living in Mani. Twelve years later, K. Koumas writes in his geography that Mani had 100,000 inhabitants which was deemed a wildly exaggerated number. In 1820, Anagnostras composition for the [[Filiki Eteria]] says that Mani had 8,000 fighting men. Kassis comes to the conclusion that Mani had around 45,000 inhabitants in 1820.<ref name=\"Kassis38\"/>}} In 1463, Kladas joined the Venetians in their [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1463\u20131479)|ongoing war]] against the Ottomans. He led the Maniots against the Ottomans with Venetian aid until 1479, when the Venetians made peace with the Ottomans and gave the Ottomans the right to rule the ''Brazzo di Maina''. Kladas refused to accept the conditions, and so the Venetians put a price on his head.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24\"/>\n\nAfter the end of the Turko-Venetian War, the Venetians left the Maniots to fend for themselves. Many of the Greeks who had revolted alongside the Venetians were massacred by the Ottomans, but many of them fled to find refuge in Mani.

The Ottomans under [[Selim II]], preparing to [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1570\u20131573)|invade]] the Venetian island of [[Cyprus]], built a fortress in Mani, at Porto Kagio, and they also garrisoned Passavas. The aim of this was to disrupt the Venetians' communication lines and to keep the Maniots at bay. Alarmed, the Maniots called upon Venetian assistance, and the Venetian navy in combination with the Maniot army captured the castle.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos25\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=25}}.</ref>\n\nCyprus fell later that year, but the fleet of the [[Holy League (Mediterranean)|Holy League]] defeated the Ottoman fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)]].

When the Porte heard about this, they sent Arslan in command of an army of 20,000 men and 70 ships to invade Mani. He succeeded in ravaging Mani and imposing taxes on the Maniots (which they did not pay). This caused Nevers to move more actively for his crusade. Nevers sent envoys to the courts of Europe looking for support. In 1619, he recruited six ships and a number of men, but he was forced to abort the mission because of the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos26\"/><ref name=\"Kassis30\"/> The idea of the crusade faded and Nevers died in 1637.<ref name=\"Kassis30\"/>\n\nIn 1645, a new Turkish-Venetian War, the so-called \"[[Cretan War (1645\u20131669)|Cretan War]]\" began, during which the Republic of Venice was attempting to defend [[Crete]], one of their provinces since 1204, from the Ottoman Empire, initially under [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Ibrahim I]]. The Maniots supported the Venetians by offering them ships. In 1659, Admiral [[Francesco Morosini]], with 13,000 Maniots as his allies, occupied [[Kalamata]], a large city near Mani. In 1667, during the [[Siege of Candia]], some Maniot pirate ships sneaked into the Ottoman fleet and managed to loot and burn some ships.

However, Ismael returned with 10,000 infantry and 2,500 artillery and started besieging the Maniots at Kelefa. The Turks nearly succeeded in breaching the walls before 4,500 Venetians under the command of Morosini arrived and forced the Turks to retreat to [[Kastania, Laconia|Kastania]] with the Maniots in pursuit.<ref name=\"Kassis32\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=32}}.</ref><ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos28\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=28}}.</ref>\n\nThe Venetians, with assistance of the Greeks, conquered the rest of the [[Peloponnese]] and then besieged [[Athens]]. During the siege of Athens, the Ottomans used the Parthenon as an ammunition depot. When artillery fire from the Venetians struck the depot, the resulting explosion damaged large portions of the Parthenon.<ref name=\"Kassis32\"/> The desperate Ottomans freed Limberakis and gave him the title \"His Highness, the Ruler of Mani\". Limberakis immediately launched several raids into Venetian-held territories of the Peloponnese.

Limberakis first attacked the city of [[Arta, Greece|Arta]], when the Ottomans destroyed his estates at [[Karpenisi]]. He captured and plundered the city before going back to Mani. The Arteans sent a committee to Venice and reported everything to the [[Doge]]. Ultimately, Limberakis moved to Italy where he died fourteen years later.<ref name=\"Kassis33\"/>\n\n===18th century===\nIn 1715, the [[Turkish\u2013Venetian War (1714\u20131718)|Ottomans attacked the Peloponnese]] and managed to drive out the Venetians within seventy days. The Venetians won some minor naval battles off Mani but abandoned the Peloponnese in 1715. The next year, the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] was signed, and the Venetians abandoned their claim to the Peloponnese.<ref name=\"Kassis34\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=34}}.</ref>\n\n====Orlov Revolt====\n{{main|Orlov Revolt}}\n\nGeorgios Papazolis, a Greek officer of the Russian army, was a friend of the [[Orlov (family)|Orlovs]] and had them convince [[Catherine the Great]] to send an army to Mani and liberate Greece.<ref name=\"Kassis34\"/> A Russian fleet of five ships and 500 soldiers under the command of [[Aleksey Grigoryevich Orlov]] sailed from the [[Baltic Sea]] in 1769 and reached Mani in 1770.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos29\"/> The fleet landed at Oitylo, where it was met by the Maniots. It was decided to divide the army into two groups, the ''Western Legion'' and the ''Eastern Legion''. The Eastern Legion, under the command of Barkof, Grigorakis, and Psaros, consisted of 500 Maniots and 6 Russians. The Western Legion, under the command of John Mavromichalis (nicknamed ''The Dog''), Piotr Dolgorukov, and Panagiotis Koumoundouros, consisted of 200 Maniots and 12 Russians.<ref name=\"Kassis34\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian fleet was besieging [[Koroni]] with assistance from the Western Legion. The siege proved to be difficult, and soon Orlov got into a dispute with John the Dog. Mavromichalis stated to Orlov that if they wanted to start a real war, they had to occupy Koroni, and that if they did not, they should not excite the Greeks in vain. Orlov replied by calling the Maniots \"ragged\" and \"rude booty men\".<ref name=\"Kassis34\"/> To this, Mavromichalis replied, \"The last of these ragged booty men keeps his freedom with his own sword and deserves more than you, slave of a whore!\"<ref name=\"Kassis35\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=35}}.</ref> The Russians left and conducted their own operations until the end of the year, when they ultimately sailed back to Russia.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos29\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Legion met with success when it defeated an army of 3,500 Turks.<ref name=\"Kassis34\"/> The Ottomans responded to this by sending an army of 8,000 to invade the Peloponnese. The Ottoman army first plundered [[Attica]] before entering the Peloponnese. At Rizomylos in Messenia, they were blocked by John Mavromichalis and 400 of his followers. The Maniots held them off for a while, but the Ottoman forces eventually did not lose due to their superior numbers. They captured John Mavromichalis, who was not only seriously wounded but also the last survivor of the battle. He was ultimately tortured to death. They then invaded Mani and began ravaging the land near Almiros (near the modern village of Kyparissos). During the night, an army of 5,000 Maniot men and women attacked the enemy camp. The Ottoman forces lost 1,700, while the Maniots only suffered thirty-nine casualties.<ref name=\"Kassis35\"/>\n\n====Ottoman invasion of Mani (1770)====\n{{main|Ottoman invasion of Mani (1770)}}\n\nAround 1770, the Ottoman commander Hasan Ghazi with 16,000 men besieged the two fighting towers (pyrgoi) of Venetsanakis clan in [[Kastania, Laconia|Kastania]]. The defenders were Constantine Kolokotronis and Panagiotis Venetsanakis with 150 men and women. The fight lasted for twelve days: most of the defenders were killed, and all prisoners of war were tortured and dismembered. The wife of Constantine Kolokotronis was dressed like a warrior and fought her way out carrying her baby, [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]], the future commander of the Greek War of Independence.<ref>{{harvnb|Roumeli\u014dt\u0113s|2002|p=31}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mani 1 small.jpg|thumb|Maniot towers like the one that held off the Ottomans at [[Skoutari, Laconia|Skoutari]].]]\nFrom Kastania, Hasan Ghazi advanced towards [[Skoutari, Laconia|Skoutari]] and laid siege to the tower of the powerful Grigorakis clan. The tower contained fifteen men, who held out for three days until the Turks undermined the tower, placed gunpowder, and blew up the entire garrison. By this time, the main Maniot army of 5,000 men and 2,000 women had established a defensive position which was on mountainous terrain above the town of [[Parasyros]]. The entire army was under the command of Exarchos Grigorakis and his nephew Zanetos Grigorakis. The Ottoman army advanced to the plain of Agio Pigada (meaning \"Holy Well\"). They sent envoys to the Maniots telling them that Hasan wanted to negotiate. The Maniots knew that if they sent envoys to the Turks, they would be executed by Hasan if the negotiations failed. However, the Maniots sent six men to discuss the terms.<ref name=\"Kassis35\"/>\n\nSix Maniot envoys were sent to Hasan and, without bowing, asked him what he wanted. Hasan's demands entailed the children of ten captains as hostages, all Maniot-held arms, and an annual head-tax to be paid as punishment for supporting the Russians. The Maniots answered Hasan's demands saying, \"We prefer to die rather than give to you our guns and children. We don't pay taxes, because our land is poor.\" Hasan became furious and had the six men decapitated and impaled on stakes so that the Maniots could see them.<ref name=\"Kassis36\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=36}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the envoys were killed, the remaining Maniots attacked the Ottomans. The fighting was fierce, and only 6,000 Turks managed to reach [[Mystras]]. No one knew exactly how many casualties the Maniots suffered, but the Turks definitively lost 10,000 men.<ref name=\"Kassis36\"/> In 1780, Hasan Ghazi, the Bey of the Peloponnese, tried to weaken the Grigorakis family by arranging the assassination of Exarchos Grigorakis. He invited him to [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]] and treated him as an honored guest but then had him hanged.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos30\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=30}}.</ref> On Easter Sunday, Exarchos' mother incited the men of Skoutari to take revenge for the death of her son.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos51\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=51}}.</ref> Commanded by Zanetos Grigorakis, the men of Skoutari dressed as priests and were allowed into Passavas.

Remnants of the two legions joined Russian sea forces as marines, participating in operations in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean. Two leaders of these volunteers, Stephanos Mavromichalis and Dimitrios Grigorakis, were scions of the main Maniot clans, each rising to the rank of major.\n\n====Lambros Katsonis====\n[[File:Lambros Katsonis.JPG|thumb|left|[[Lambros Katsonis]]]]\n\nDuring Zanetos' rule, Mani became a base for many [[klephts]] and other Greek bandits. Among them was the famous Greek pirate and officer of the Russian army, [[Lambros Katsonis]], who helped the Russians with their wars against the Ottomans, Andreas Androutsos (father of [[Odysseas Androutsos|Odysseas]]), and [[Zacharias Barbitsiotis]].<ref name=\"Kassis37\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=37}}.</ref> On January 9, 1792, [[Catherine II of Russia]] had her representative [[Alexander Bezborodko]] sign the [[Treaty of Jassy]] with [[Grand Vizier]] Koca Yusuf Pasha of the Ottoman Empire. The treaty ended the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787\u20131792)|Russo-Turkish War]], recognized Russia's 1783 annexation of the [[Crimean Khanate]], and transferred [[Yedisan]] to Russia, making the [[Dniester]] the Russo-Turkish frontier in [[Europe]] while leaving the [[Asia]]tic frontier ([[Kuban River]]) unchanged.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos140\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=140}}.</ref> Lambros Katsonis said: \"Aikaterini (Greek: Catherine) made her treaty, but Katsonis didn't make his treaty with the enemy.\"<ref name=\"Kassis37\"/>\n\nKatsonis, together with Androutsos and Barbitsiotis, built a gun battery at Porto Kagio. He gathered a small army and a navy of eleven ships and attacked Ottoman ships in the area. However, not being able to maintain his ships, he started attacking ships from other countries. Later that year, he sank two French ships, which was the beginning of the end for Katsonis. An Ottoman fleet of thirty ships and a French destroyer attacked Katsonis at Porto Kagio. Katsonis' men fled to land; Katsonis himself escaped to [[Odessa]] on one of the ships.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos140\"/>\n\nAndroutsos with 500 men tried to cross the Peloponnese and enter Roumelia. Barbitsiotis in a rear-guard action managed to help fight his way through the Peloponnese and into Roumelia.<ref name=\"Kassis37\"/> In 1798, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], at the time a general serving in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] under the orders of the [[French Directory]], sent two members of the Stephanopoulos family to Mani in order to convince the Maniots to attack the Ottomans from the Peloponnese while he attacked from [[Egypt]]. Zacharias Barbitsiotis and Zanetbey (Zanetos Grigorakis) accepted the offer, and Napoleon sent them weapons. When the Turks discovered this, they had{{how|date=June 2014}} Zanetos replaced as bey with Panagiotis Koumoundouros.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos31\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Modern Mani==\n\n===Early 19th century and the beginning of \"Greek War of Independence\"===\nDuring [[Ottoman Invasion of Mani (1803)|1803]], the Ottomans deposed Panagiotis Koumoundouros, because he was not capable of subduing Zanetos Grigorakis, who was still receiving weapons from the French at his castle at [[Cranae]]. The Ottomans replaced him with Antony Grigorakis or Antonbey, cousin of Zanetos.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos31\"/> The Turkish fleet under the command of the [[admiral]] Seremet,<ref name=\"Kassis37\"/> was unable to capture Cranae and was soon forced to retreat.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos31\"/>\n\n[[File:Limeni Mani.jpg|thumb|[[Limeni]], [[Areopoli]], stronghold of Mavromichalis' clan]]\n\nIn 1805, Seremet attacked Zacharias Barbitsiotis at his fortress in the [[Taygetus]] mountains and managed to kill him.<ref name=\"Kassis37\"/> In [[Ottoman Invasion of Mani (1807)|1807]], the Ottomans attacked Antonbey at [[Gytheio]], because he was unwilling to suppress his cousin, who was still attacking the Turks. The Turks were once again forced to retreat. Three years later, Antonbey resigned in favor of his son-in-law, Konstantis Zervakos, who was favorable to the bey of the Peloponnese. However, the Maniots did not agree with the choice and deposed Zervakos.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos32\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nLater that year, the Maniot leaders gathered at Gytheio and elected Theodoros Zanerakos or Theodorobey, nephew of Zanetos Grigorakis, as Bey of Mani. During [[Ottoman Invasion of Mani (1815)|1815]], the Ottomans attacked Mani but were driven back.<ref name=\"Kassis38\"/> Theodorobey was removed from power later that year and was replaced by [[Petros Mavromichalis]] or Petrobey.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos32\"/>\n\nPierros Grigorakis, a son of Zanetos, entered Russian service on Zante and commanded a force of some 500 Maniots known as the Spartan Legion. This was part of the Legion of Light Riflemen, a force made up of mainland refugees that defended the Ionian Islands and participated in Russian operations in the Mediterranean in the years 1805\u20131807. Many veterans of this unit later joined the secret society [[Filiki Eteria]] (\"Friendly Company\") and participated with the Greek Revolution, including Elias Chrisospathis, who initiated the Maniots into the secret society, as well as Pierros and his brothers Giorgos and Zanetakos.\n\nPetros Mavromichalis was John the Dog's nephew. He was the first Maniot bey from Messa Mani (Inner Mani).<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos32\"/> In 1798, he had also been approached by Napoleon to join the war on the Ottomans, but after the failure of the [[French invasion of Egypt (1798)|French invasion of Egypt]], Petros joined the French army only for a while and fought in the [[Ionian Islands]]. It was rumored at the time that he was appointed bey only because his uncle was not killed, had converted to Islam, and had become an officer in the Ottoman army.\nIn 1819, he joined the [[Filiki Eteria]], which by 1821 was prepared to revolt.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos33\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=33}}.</ref>\n\n===\"Declaration of War\" and Contributions to the Greek Revolution===\n[[File:Mani Flag (Greece).svg|thumb|Maniot flag with the motto \"Victory or Death\".]]\n\nManiots, known for their martial qualities, were the very first to join the Greek liberation movement (a claim shared with many other Greek areas) and their contribution proved to be pivotal.

On March 23, they captured the city.<ref name=\"Kassis39\"/> From Kalamata, Mavromichalis wrote letters to the states of [[Europe]], informing them of what the Greeks were doing and signing them as \"Commander in Chief of the Spartan Forces\". The Messenian Senate was also held in Kalamata. Kolokotronis wanted to attack [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]] and capture the main Turkish city in the Peloponnese. However, Mavromichalis wanted to capture the smaller towns first and then take [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]]. The Senate agreed with Mavromichalis, and the Maniots attacked the Turks of Messenia and Laconia.<ref name=\"Paroulakis58\">{{harvnb|Paroulakis|1984|p=58}}.</ref>{{Broken footnote|date=February 2020}}\n\nKolokotronis, convinced that he was correct, moved into [[Arcadia]] with 300 Maniots.

On September 12, 1821, the Turkish capital in the Peloponnese fell. On July 4 1822, [[Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis (military commander)|Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis]], Petros Mavromichalis' younger brother, was killed in [[Ammoudia, Preveza|Splantza]], near the [[Souli]]ote fortress of Kiafa. \n\n[[Mahmud II]] became desperate and during 1824 called on his [[Viceroy]], [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], to aid him to attack Mani. Ali promised to aid him in return for the islands of [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]], as well as making his eldest son, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]], pasha of the [[Peloponnese]]. Mahmud II accepted the offer and Ali sent his son in command of the expedition. Meanwhile, the Greeks were in disarray because of political rivalries, which caused a civil war. Kolokotronis was arrested, his son [[Panos Kolokotronis|Panos]] was killed, and his nephew [[Nikitaras]] fled.<ref name=\"Paroulakis113\">{{harvnb|Paroulakis|1984|p=113}}.</ref>{{Broken footnote|date=February 2020}}\n\nIbrahim made good use of this turmoil and landed with his army (25-30,000 infantry, cavalry and artillery supported by the Ottoman-Egyptian fleet) at [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]]. Ibrahim soon had recaptured the Peloponnese except for [[Nafplio]] and Mani.

He sent an envoy to the Maniots demanding that they surrender or else he would ravage their land. Instead of surrendering, the Maniots replied:<ref name=\"Kassis39\"/>\n\n''From the few Greeks of Mani and the rest of Greeks who live there to Ibrahim Pasha.

This plan was described by Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos as \"excellent\" because it would catch Areopoli by surprise since it was ill defended. By capturing Areopoli, Ibrahim could disrupt the Maniot communication lines and control the mountain passes that led to [[Gytheio]]. This would also allow the Egyptians to attack the Maniots at Verga from the rear.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62\"/>\n\nOn June 24, Ibrahim sent a small fleet carrying 1,500 troops to land at the Bay of Diros and capture Areopoli.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62\"/> As the Egyptians landed on the beach, the alarm bells rang.<ref name=\"Kassis40\"/> Soon, 300 women and old men who had been harvesting the crops gathered and, armed only with their scythes and cudgels, charged at the Egyptians. The Egyptians, not expecting any resistance, were caught by surprise at this sudden attack and were forced to retreat to a fortified position on the beach where they could receive support from their ships. Eventually, 300 Maniots arrived from other towns, and the Egyptians were forced to either swim to their ships or be slain.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62\"/> Not only was Ibrahim's defeat costly, as he lost 1,000 men, but his plan to invade and conquer Mani was utterly ruined.

He sent an army of 6,000 Arabs to advance to the Taygetus and capture Gytheio and Laconian Mani. In command of the army was a Greek traitor from the village of [[Vordonia]], called Bosinas. As he advanced towards Polytsaravos (nowadays a deserted place in the southern part of [[Taygetus]]), he was stopped by Theodoros Stathakos, who together with his family of thirteen people was waiting in their tower. Bosinas tried to make Stathakos surrender, and when the latter feigned surrender, Bosinas came towards the tower. However, once Bosinas was within range, Stathakos and his small band killed him. In retaliation, Bosinas' army shot at the tower with their cannons and destroyed it.<ref name=\"Kassis41\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=41}}.</ref>\n\nThe Egyptians then proceeded towards the town of Polytsaravos and reached it on August 28. The inhabitants of the town had sent the women and children to take refuge in the mountains before improving the fortifications they had there. The town militia was reinforced by other Maniots, and soon the defenders numbered 2,500 men.<ref name=\"Kassis41\"/> The Egyptians had trouble advancing to Polytsaravos, because it was surrounded by rocks situated on high ground.<ref name=\"Barrow102\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2000|p=102}}.</ref> As soon as the Arabs arrived, the Maniots rallied around their fortifications and attacked the Arabs.

The Maniots stopped the Egyptians and Ibrahim Pasha who had not been defeated this decisively before. This was the last invasion of Mani by the Egyptians or the Ottomans, as the Peloponnese, central Greece, and some of the Aegean islands were liberated in 1828 after the naval forces of [[Bourbon Restoration]] France under [[Henri de Rigny]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] under [[Edward Codrington]], and the [[Russian Empire]] under [[Login Geiden]] defeated Ibrahim at the [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]] in 1827.\n\n===Republic and Regency===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Petrobey Mavromichalis1.jpg\n| width1 = 130\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Kapodistrias2.jpg\n| width2 = 105\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The imprisonment of [[Petros Mavromichalis]] (left) by [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] (right) led to the assassination of Kapodistrias.\n}}\n\nIn 1831, [[Ioannis Capodistrias]] became governor of Greece.<ref name=\"Kassis41\"/> Capodistrias quarreled with the Mavromichalis clan because the Maniots refused to pay taxes to the new government.<ref name=\"Paroulakis165\">{{harvnb|Paroulakis|1984|p=165}}.</ref>{{Broken footnote|date=February 2020}} Capodistrias requested that [[Tzanis Mavromichalis|Tzanis]], Petros' brother, go to [[Nafplio]], then capital of Greece, and negotiate.

Later that year, an army of 6,000 men with five cannons under the command of General [[Christian von Schmaltz]], assisted by five squadrons of royalist Maniots, once again besieged Petrovouni. When news of an army of 1,000 Maniots was approaching, they retreated to Gytheio.<ref name=\"Kassis44\"/>\n\nThe Council decided that they could not subdue the Maniots by force, so they decided to send a diplomat, Max Feder, with the intention of subduing Mani by playing the love of money against the love of independence. He went to different Maniot families and offered them positions if they supported the king. Many of the Achamnomeri (see note \u03b1 below) and some Megalogenites were convinced by his offers and submitted. However, several of the older families and the poorer Achamnomeri rejected the offer, because the former did not want to be dependent on a king and the latter did not want governors with superior rights.\nIn [[Kitta]], this division caused bloodshed when the king's supporters started fighting the other Maniots under the command of Giorgaros Skylakakos.<ref name=\"Kassis44\"/> Feder soon arrived with his new allies and exploded Skylakakos and all his allies in his towers. Thus the Bavarians managed to annex the whole peninsula to the Greek kingdom.<ref name=\"Kassis45\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=45}}.</ref>\n\n===Late 19th century===\n[[File:Al\u00e8xandros Koumoundo\u00f9ros.JPG|thumb|[[Alexandros Koumoundouros]] (1817\u20131883), born in the Messenian side of Mani, was a political personality famous for his work towards national progress.]]\n\nDuring Otto's rule, blood was spilled in Mani because of the [[vendettas]], which have plagued the area for centuries.<ref name=\"Kassis45\"/> The vendettas continued until 1870, when a Maniot vendetta was halted by the efforts of a regular army with artillery support.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos36\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=36}}.</ref> In 1841, [[Crete]] revolted against the Ottomans.

The Cretans, together with the Maniots, forced the Turks into a fortress, where they besieged them. A combined Ottoman-British fleet managed to subdue the Cretans, but the indefeated Maniots chose to go back to Mani. In 1866, a new revolution sparked in Crete, and 2,000 Maniots under the command of Petropoulakos went to assist their cousins. However, the Cretans were defeated, and the undefeated Maniots again returned to Mani.<ref name=\"Kassis45\"/>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Gythio.JPG|thumb|left|View of the promenade of [[Gytheio]], largest town of Mani.]]\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, Greece was involved with the [[Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Macedonian Struggle]], military conflicts against the Bulgarian organization known as the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]], and Turkish forces in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-occupied [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Many volunteers from Mani took part in the war such as soldiers from the Dritsakos, Koutsonikolakos, Kosteas, Georgopapadakos, Iliopiereas, Loukakos, Kyriakoulakos and Kalantzakos families. The Maniots also took part in the series of wars that followed including the [[Balkan Wars]], [[World War I]], and the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]]. The participation of troops from Mani in these wars under [[Constantine I of Greece]], created strong [[Monarchism|royalist]] feelings amongst Maniots. That is why most Maniots remained loyal to Constantine during the Greek [[National Schism]].<ref name=\"Kassis46\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=46}}.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the Maniot armed forces significantly helped the [[Hellenic Army]] to win the [[Battle of Greece]]. A Maniot named Colonel [[Konstantinos Davakis]] was among the leaders of the armed forces.<ref name=\"Kassis46\"/> Davakis, in command of the Pindus Detachment, defeated the elite Italian SOF brigate \"Julia\" at the [[Battle of Pindus]] (October 28-November 13, 1940), despite the Italians having more advanced weaponry.\n\nLater, Maniots won another victory when the [[Royal Navy]] of the [[United Kingdom]] defeated the [[Regia Marina]] of Italy in the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] (March 27-March 29, 1941) on Cape [[Tenaro]]. However, [[Nazi Germany]] attacked Greece in order to support the Italians. The Greeks were forced to retreat, and soon Mani revived its forgotten role as a center for refugees. During April 1941, the British started evacuating their troops from Porto Kagio. By the end of that month, Mani and the rest of Greece were under [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Italian and German occupation]].<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos141\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=141}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the occupation, Mani became a stronghold of the [[Security Battalions]], because of the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] sentiment of the Maniots. The Germans and Italians left Greece in 1944, but as soon as they left the [[Greek Civil War]] began. The armies of the [[Communist Party of Greece]], [[Ellinikos La\u00efkos Apeleftherotikos Stratos|ELAS]], and [[Dimokratikos Stratos Elladas|DSE]], fought against the Hellenic Army and the royalists.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos38\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=38}}.</ref> Mani never recovered from both wars, and soon many of the young people of Mani left for [[Athens]], the [[United States]], and [[Australia]].<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos39\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=39}}.</ref>\n\nNowadays, Mani is divided between two regional units: [[Laconia]] and [[Messenia]]. Mani has around 18,000 inhabitants, with the most important and populous town being [[Gytheio]]. Mani's main source of income is tourism. The most famous of the tourist attractions are the [[Pyrgos Dirou|Caves of Diros]], which are two caves that have underwater rivers flowing through them.\n\n==Maniot dialect==\n[[File:Modern Greek dialects en.svg|200px|left|thumb|A map showing the distribution of the Maniot dialect.]]\n\nThe Maniot dialect of Modern Greek has several archaic properties that distinguishes it from most mainstream varieties. One of them, shared with the highly divergent [[Tsakonian language|Tsakonian]] as well as with the old dialects spoken around Athens until the 19th century, is the divergent treatment of historical {{IPA|/y/}} (written <\u03c5>). Although this sound merged to {{IPA|/i/}} everywhere else, these dialects have {{IPA|/u/}} instead (e.g. {{IPA|[\u02c8ksulo]}} versus standard {{IPA|[\u02c8ksilo]}} 'wood').<ref name=\"Trudgill5\">{{harvnb|Trudgill|2003|pp=54\u201359}}.</ref> These varieties are thought to be relic areas of a previously larger areal dialect group that used to share these features and was later divided by the penetration of [[Arvanitika]] settlement in much of its area in the late Middle Ages.\n\nOther features of the Maniot dialect include the palatalization of velar consonants, i.e. the realization of {{IPA|/k, \u0261, x, \u0263/}} as ({{IPA|[t\u0255, d\u0291]}} or {{IPA|[\u0255, \u0291]}} before {{IPA|/i, e, j/}}. This feature is shared with many southern dialects of Greek, especially Cretan.\n\n==Economy==\nThere is little information on the economy of Mani during the early stages of Ottoman dominance of Greece, and what is known of the economy in the 17th and 18th centuries is from foreign observers. In Exo Mani, [[olives]] in great numbers but it was not until the 18th century that olives were widely spread in Mesa Mani. Exports from Exo Mani also included [[pine]] for masts as well [[turpentine]], hides as well as a tanning agent and ''prinokoki'', a crimson-coloured dye. The north-west parts of Mesa Mani were rich in [[morus (plant)|mulberries]] and [[silk]]. Honey is also of superior quality.  Another important part of the Maniot economy was piracy. Nowadays the main industries in Mani are [[agriculture]] and tourism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zorbas.de/maniguide/turkok.html|title=The Economy|accessdate=2008-01-02|work=|author=John Chapman|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105042231/http://www.zorbas.de/maniguide/turkok.html|archive-date=2008-01-05|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Maniatissa.jpg|thumb|left|Woman from Mani.]]\n\n===Dances===\nTwo dances come from Mani: Palio Maniatiko (meaning \"Old Maniot\") and the Modern Maniatiko.

The priests will seem to be sorry, and endeavor to make the strangers to believe they were altogether ignorant of any such design.

The Maniots were famous and fearsome pirates whose ships dominated the Maniot coastline. The Maniots became pirates because Mani was not a very fertile land and the Maniots did not have many natural resources. The Maniots considered piracy a legitimate response to the fact that their land was poor, and it became their main source of income.<ref name=\"Barrow16\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2000|p=16}}.</ref> The pirate raids were not stopped by the local priests of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], who in fact blessed the ships before they left and sometimes accompanied them on raids. Most of the Maniot pirates came from Messa Mani (Inner Mani).<ref name=\"Barrow17\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2000|p=17}}.</ref> The main victims of Maniot pirates were the Ottomans, but the Maniots also targeted ships of powerful European countries.<ref name=\"Kassis38\"/>\n\n===Superstition===\nThe Maniots are a very superstitious people.<ref name=\"Barrow18\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2000|p=18}}.</ref> Maniots mainly believe in [[Witchcraft|witches]], [[demon]]s, [[vampire]]s, and [[ghost]]s.<ref name=\"Barrow18\"/> When [[Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon]], was touring Mani in 1839, he found a fresh egg by the side of the road and offered it to a Maniot soldier who escorted him, who declined the offer claiming that if a [[hag]] had enchanted it he would have to marry her.<ref name=\"Barrow18\"/> The Maniots thought that certain areas were haunted by demons.<ref name=\"Barrow18\"/>\n\n===Vendettas===\nAnother important aspect of Maniot culture were the [[Feud|vendettas]] which frequently plagued Mani. Usually, the decision to start a vendetta was made at a family gathering. The main aim of a vendetta was usually to wipe out the other family.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm|title=Vendetta|accessdate=2007-01-25|work=Mani: Traditions: Vendetta|author=Venizeleas|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230081926/http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm|archive-date=2006-12-30|df=}}</ref> The families involved locked themselves in their towers and whenever they got the chance murdered members of the opposing family.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/> The other families in the village normally locked themselves in their towers in order not to get in the way of the fighting.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/>\n\nSome vendettas went on for months, sometimes years. In vendettas, the families could have a truce or ''treva'', if one family needed to attend a religious ceremony or when it was time to harvest the crops.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/> As soon as the treva ended, the killing could resume. Vendettas usually ended when one family was exterminated or when the defeated family left the town. Sometimes families came to terms, and vendettas stopped when the Turks invaded.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/> The longest treva occurred when the Mavromichalis clan declared war on the Turks in 1821. Vendettas continued after the liberation of Greece even though the Regency tried to demolish the towers.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/> The Maniot vendetta is considered the most vicious and ruthless. One of the last vendettas on record required the combined forces of the [[Greek Police]], [[Greek Army]] and [[Greek Navy]] to stop it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cretapost.gr/282097/1906-i-ematiri-venteta-anamesa-se-maniates-ke-kritikous/|title=1906: \u0397 \u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03ae \u03b2\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b5 \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ac\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u2013 Cretapost.gr|author=|date=12 November 2016|website=cretapost.gr|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515195912/http://www.cretapost.gr/282097/1906-i-ematiri-venteta-anamesa-se-maniates-ke-kritikous|archive-date=15 May 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Cuisine===\nLocal specialities:\n\n* ''[[Hilopites]]''\n* ''Kolokythokorfades''\n* ''Lalagides'' or ''Lalagia'' (\u039b\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2)\n* ''Paspalas''\n* ''Regali''\n* ''[[Syglino]]'' (pork meat)\n* ''[[Diples]]'' (dessert)\n\n==Ethnology==\nThe inhabitants of Mani claim to be direct descendants of the ancient [[Sparta]]ns and are considered more \"pure-blooded\" Greeks. According to their story, after the Romans took over Laconia, many of the Spartan citizens who were loyal to the Spartan laws of [[Lycurgus (Sparta)|Lycurgus]] decided to go to the Spartan mountains of Mani with the rest of the Spartans rather than be in Achaean or, later, Roman service.<ref name=\"Hellander263\">{{harvnb|Hellander|2008|p=204}}.</ref> Kassis claims that Maniots rarely mated with non-Maniots until the 20th century.<ref name=\"Kassis20\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=20}}.</ref>\n\nMani became a refuge during the 4th century when the [[Barbarian invasions]] started in Europe. When the Avars and Slavs invaded the Peloponnese, many Greek refugees fled to Mani since the invaders could not infiltrate the mountainous terrain. According to Constantine Porphyrogenitus, the Maniots were not conquered by the Slavs and were descended from the ancient 'Romaioi'.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos22\"/> Historian David Howarth states: ''The only Greeks that have had an unbroken descent were the few small clans like the Maniotes who were so fierce, and lived so far up the mountain, that invaders left them alone.''<ref name=\"Howarth69\">{{harvnb|Howarth|1976|p=69}}.</ref>\n<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n\n==Notable Maniots==\n* [[Panagiotis Doxaras]], painter, founder of the [[Heptanese School (painting)|Heptanese School]]\n* [[Limberakis Gerakaris]], First [[Bey]] of [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]] and one of the most feared Maniot Pirates\n* [[Stylianos Mavromichalis]], lawyer, president of the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Areopagus]] and Prime Minister (1963)\n* [[Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis (military commander)|Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis]], hero of the [[Greek War of Independence]]\n* [[Petros Mavromichalis]], starter and fighter of the [[Greek War of Independence]], last [[Bey]] of [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]], [[Lieutenant General]] and President of the Executive (1823).\n* [[Michail Anagnostakos]], military officer and army leader of the [[Macedonian Struggle]].\n* [[Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis|Kyriakoulis P.

In the [[early modern period]], Maniots had a reputation as fierce and proudly independent [[warrior]]s, who practiced [[piracy]] and fierce [[Feud#Blood feuds/vendetta|blood feuds]].

The Maniots were the last inhabitants of Greece to openly follow the pagan [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] religion.

The Eastern Roman Empire was partitioned between several Greek and Latin successor states, notably including (from west to east) the [[Despotate of Epirus]], the [[Latin Empire]], the [[Empire of Nicaea]], and the [[Empire of Trebizond]]. These four empires produced rival emperors, struggling for control over each other and the rest of the semi-independent states emerging in the area. [[William of Champlitte]] and [[Geoffrey I Villehardouin]] defeated the Peloponnesian Greeks at the [[Battle of the Olive Grove of Koundouros]] (1205), and the Peloponnese became the [[Principality of Achaea]]. In 1210, Mani was given to Baron Jean de Neuilly as Hereditary Marshal, and he built the castle of [[Passavas]] on the ruins of [[Las (Greece)|Las]]. The castle occupied a significant position, as it controlled an important pass from Gythium to [[Oitylo]] and contained the Maniots.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos23\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=23}}.</ref><ref name=\"Kassis23\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=23}}.</ref>\n\nThe Maniots, however, were not easily contained, and they were not the only threat to the Frankish occupation of the Peloponnese. The [[Melingoi|Melengi]], a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribe in the [[Taygetus]] [[mountain range]], raided Laconia from the west, and the [[Tsakonians]] also resisted the Franks. In 1249, the new prince, [[William II of Villehardouin]], acted against the raiders. He used the newly captured fortress of [[Monemvasia]] to keep the Tsakonians at bay, and he built the castle at [[Mystras]] in the Taygetus mountains overlooking Sparta in order to contain the Melengi. To stop the Maniot raids, he built the castle of [[Megali Maina]], which is most probably [[Tigani]]. It is described as ''at a fearful cliff with a headland above''. A Latin bishop was appointed for Mani during the 1250s. In 1259, the bishop was captured during the [[Battle of Pelagonia]] by the renewed Byzantine Empire under the leadership of Nicaea.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos24\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=24}}.</ref>\n\n===Under the Despotate of Morea===\n[[File:Despotate of Morea 1450.svg|thumb|[[Despotate of Morea]], c. 1450.]]\n\nOn July 25, 1261, the Byzantines under [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] recaptured Constantinople. Prince William was set free, on the condition that he had to surrender the fortresses of Megali Maina, Mystras, [[Geronthrae]] and Monemvasia, as well as surrender hostages including [[Lady Margaret, Baroness of Passavas]]. With the Franks gone from Laconia, the Maniots lived in peace under the [[Despotate of Morea]], whose successive [[Despotes]] governed the province.

He succeeded in ravaging Mani and imposing taxes on the Maniots (which they did not pay). This caused Nevers to move more actively for his crusade. Nevers sent envoys to the courts of Europe looking for support.

The Maniots supported the Venetians by offering them ships. In 1659, Admiral [[Francesco Morosini]], with 13,000 Maniots as his allies, occupied [[Kalamata]], a large city near Mani. In 1667, during the [[Siege of Candia]], some Maniot pirate ships sneaked into the Ottoman fleet and managed to loot and burn some ships.

Baba arrived in Mani demanding that the Maniots surrender hostages, but instead he was answered with bullets. During the night, ten Maniots went and cut the [[hawser]]s of Hasan's ships. This caused some of Baba's ships to founder on some rocks, and the Maniots, taking advantage of the situation, attacked and killed the Turks and seized the ships.

At the age of fifteen, he was in the Venetian galleys as a rower. After being released by the Venetians, he continued piracy and was captured by the Turks in 1667. The Grand Vizier decided to give him amnesty if he cooperated with the Turks and helped them conquer Mani. Gerakaris agreed and in 1670 became the bey of Mani. One of Gerakis' first acts was to exile his clan's enemies, the Iatriani family and the Stephanopoulos family from Oitylo. The Iatriani fled in 1670 and settled in [[Livorno]], [[Tuscany]]. The Stephanopoulos clan was forced to leave Oitylo in 1676, and after having gained permission from the [[Republic of Genoa]], went to [[Corsica]].

The Turkish general in the Peloponnese, [[Ismael (Turkish general)|Ismael]], discovered this plan and attacked Mani with 10,000 men. The Turks ravaged the plains, but during the night the Maniots attacked and killed 1,800 Turks. The other Turks retreated to the castles of Kelefa and Zarnatas, where they were besieged by the Maniots. After brief sieges, the Maniots managed to capture both [[Koroni]] and Kelefa. However, Ismael returned with 10,000 infantry and 2,500 artillery and started besieging the Maniots at Kelefa. The Turks nearly succeeded in breaching the walls before 4,500 Venetians under the command of Morosini arrived and forced the Turks to retreat to [[Kastania, Laconia|Kastania]] with the Maniots in pursuit.<ref name=\"Kassis32\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=32}}.</ref><ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos28\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=28}}.</ref>\n\nThe Venetians, with assistance of the Greeks, conquered the rest of the [[Peloponnese]] and then besieged [[Athens]].

It was decided to divide the army into two groups, the ''Western Legion'' and the ''Eastern Legion''. The Eastern Legion, under the command of Barkof, Grigorakis, and Psaros, consisted of 500 Maniots and 6 Russians. The Western Legion, under the command of John Mavromichalis (nicknamed ''The Dog''), Piotr Dolgorukov, and Panagiotis Koumoundouros, consisted of 200 Maniots and 12 Russians.<ref name=\"Kassis34\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian fleet was besieging [[Koroni]] with assistance from the Western Legion. The siege proved to be difficult, and soon Orlov got into a dispute with John the Dog. Mavromichalis stated to Orlov that if they wanted to start a real war, they had to occupy Koroni, and that if they did not, they should not excite the Greeks in vain. Orlov replied by calling the Maniots \"ragged\" and \"rude booty men\".<ref name=\"Kassis34\"/> To this, Mavromichalis replied, \"The last of these ragged booty men keeps his freedom with his own sword and deserves more than you, slave of a whore!\"<ref name=\"Kassis35\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=35}}.</ref> The Russians left and conducted their own operations until the end of the year, when they ultimately sailed back to Russia.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos29\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Legion met with success when it defeated an army of 3,500 Turks.<ref name=\"Kassis34\"/> The Ottomans responded to this by sending an army of 8,000 to invade the Peloponnese. The Ottoman army first plundered [[Attica]] before entering the Peloponnese. At Rizomylos in Messenia, they were blocked by John Mavromichalis and 400 of his followers. The Maniots held them off for a while, but the Ottoman forces eventually did not lose due to their superior numbers. They captured John Mavromichalis, who was not only seriously wounded but also the last survivor of the battle. He was ultimately tortured to death. They then invaded Mani and began ravaging the land near Almiros (near the modern village of Kyparissos). During the night, an army of 5,000 Maniot men and women attacked the enemy camp. The Ottoman forces lost 1,700, while the Maniots only suffered thirty-nine casualties.<ref name=\"Kassis35\"/>\n\n====Ottoman invasion of Mani (1770)====\n{{main|Ottoman invasion of Mani (1770)}}\n\nAround 1770, the Ottoman commander Hasan Ghazi with 16,000 men besieged the two fighting towers (pyrgoi) of Venetsanakis clan in [[Kastania, Laconia|Kastania]]. The defenders were Constantine Kolokotronis and Panagiotis Venetsanakis with 150 men and women. The fight lasted for twelve days: most of the defenders were killed, and all prisoners of war were tortured and dismembered. The wife of Constantine Kolokotronis was dressed like a warrior and fought her way out carrying her baby, [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]], the future commander of the Greek War of Independence.<ref>{{harvnb|Roumeli\u014dt\u0113s|2002|p=31}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mani 1 small.jpg|thumb|Maniot towers like the one that held off the Ottomans at [[Skoutari, Laconia|Skoutari]].]]\nFrom Kastania, Hasan Ghazi advanced towards [[Skoutari, Laconia|Skoutari]] and laid siege to the tower of the powerful Grigorakis clan. The tower contained fifteen men, who held out for three days until the Turks undermined the tower, placed gunpowder, and blew up the entire garrison. By this time, the main Maniot army of 5,000 men and 2,000 women had established a defensive position which was on mountainous terrain above the town of [[Parasyros]]. The entire army was under the command of Exarchos Grigorakis and his nephew Zanetos Grigorakis. The Ottoman army advanced to the plain of Agio Pigada (meaning \"Holy Well\"). They sent envoys to the Maniots telling them that Hasan wanted to negotiate. The Maniots knew that if they sent envoys to the Turks, they would be executed by Hasan if the negotiations failed. However, the Maniots sent six men to discuss the terms.<ref name=\"Kassis35\"/>\n\nSix Maniot envoys were sent to Hasan and, without bowing, asked him what he wanted. Hasan's demands entailed the children of ten captains as hostages, all Maniot-held arms, and an annual head-tax to be paid as punishment for supporting the Russians. The Maniots answered Hasan's demands saying, \"We prefer to die rather than give to you our guns and children. We don't pay taxes, because our land is poor.\" Hasan became furious and had the six men decapitated and impaled on stakes so that the Maniots could see them.<ref name=\"Kassis36\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=36}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the envoys were killed, the remaining Maniots attacked the Ottomans. The fighting was fierce, and only 6,000 Turks managed to reach [[Mystras]]. No one knew exactly how many casualties the Maniots suffered, but the Turks definitively lost 10,000 men.<ref name=\"Kassis36\"/> In 1780, Hasan Ghazi, the Bey of the Peloponnese, tried to weaken the Grigorakis family by arranging the assassination of Exarchos Grigorakis.

Remnants of the two legions joined Russian sea forces as marines, participating in operations in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean. Two leaders of these volunteers, Stephanos Mavromichalis and Dimitrios Grigorakis, were scions of the main Maniot clans, each rising to the rank of major.\n\n====Lambros Katsonis====\n[[File:Lambros Katsonis.JPG|thumb|left|[[Lambros Katsonis]]]]\n\nDuring Zanetos' rule, Mani became a base for many [[klephts]] and other Greek bandits. Among them was the famous Greek pirate and officer of the Russian army, [[Lambros Katsonis]], who helped the Russians with their wars against the Ottomans, Andreas Androutsos (father of [[Odysseas Androutsos|Odysseas]]), and [[Zacharias Barbitsiotis]].<ref name=\"Kassis37\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=37}}.</ref> On January 9, 1792, [[Catherine II of Russia]] had her representative [[Alexander Bezborodko]] sign the [[Treaty of Jassy]] with [[Grand Vizier]] Koca Yusuf Pasha of the Ottoman Empire. The treaty ended the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787\u20131792)|Russo-Turkish War]], recognized Russia's 1783 annexation of the [[Crimean Khanate]], and transferred [[Yedisan]] to Russia, making the [[Dniester]] the Russo-Turkish frontier in [[Europe]] while leaving the [[Asia]]tic frontier ([[Kuban River]]) unchanged.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos140\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=140}}.</ref> Lambros Katsonis said: \"Aikaterini (Greek: Catherine) made her treaty, but Katsonis didn't make his treaty with the enemy.\"<ref name=\"Kassis37\"/>\n\nKatsonis, together with Androutsos and Barbitsiotis, built a gun battery at Porto Kagio. He gathered a small army and a navy of eleven ships and attacked Ottoman ships in the area. However, not being able to maintain his ships, he started attacking ships from other countries. Later that year, he sank two French ships, which was the beginning of the end for Katsonis. An Ottoman fleet of thirty ships and a French destroyer attacked Katsonis at Porto Kagio. Katsonis' men fled to land; Katsonis himself escaped to [[Odessa]] on one of the ships.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos140\"/>\n\nAndroutsos with 500 men tried to cross the Peloponnese and enter Roumelia. Barbitsiotis in a rear-guard action managed to help fight his way through the Peloponnese and into Roumelia.<ref name=\"Kassis37\"/> In 1798, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]], at the time a general serving in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] under the orders of the [[French Directory]], sent two members of the Stephanopoulos family to Mani in order to convince the Maniots to attack the Ottomans from the Peloponnese while he attacked from [[Egypt]]. Zacharias Barbitsiotis and Zanetbey (Zanetos Grigorakis) accepted the offer, and Napoleon sent them weapons.

The Turks were once again forced to retreat. Three years later, Antonbey resigned in favor of his son-in-law, Konstantis Zervakos, who was favorable to the bey of the Peloponnese. However, the Maniots did not agree with the choice and deposed Zervakos.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos32\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nLater that year, the Maniot leaders gathered at Gytheio and elected Theodoros Zanerakos or Theodorobey, nephew of Zanetos Grigorakis, as Bey of Mani. During [[Ottoman Invasion of Mani (1815)|1815]], the Ottomans attacked Mani but were driven back.<ref name=\"Kassis38\"/> Theodorobey was removed from power later that year and was replaced by [[Petros Mavromichalis]] or Petrobey.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos32\"/>\n\nPierros Grigorakis, a son of Zanetos, entered Russian service on Zante and commanded a force of some 500 Maniots known as the Spartan Legion. This was part of the Legion of Light Riflemen, a force made up of mainland refugees that defended the Ionian Islands and participated in Russian operations in the Mediterranean in the years 1805\u20131807. Many veterans of this unit later joined the secret society [[Filiki Eteria]] (\"Friendly Company\") and participated with the Greek Revolution, including Elias Chrisospathis, who initiated the Maniots into the secret society, as well as Pierros and his brothers Giorgos and Zanetakos.\n\nPetros Mavromichalis was John the Dog's nephew. He was the first Maniot bey from Messa Mani (Inner Mani).<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos32\"/> In 1798, he had also been approached by Napoleon to join the war on the Ottomans, but after the failure of the [[French invasion of Egypt (1798)|French invasion of Egypt]], Petros joined the French army only for a while and fought in the [[Ionian Islands]]. It was rumored at the time that he was appointed bey only because his uncle was not killed, had converted to Islam, and had become an officer in the Ottoman army.\nIn 1819, he joined the [[Filiki Eteria]], which by 1821 was prepared to revolt.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos33\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=33}}.</ref>\n\n===\"Declaration of War\" and Contributions to the Greek Revolution===\n[[File:Mani Flag (Greece).svg|thumb|Maniot flag with the motto \"Victory or Death\".]]\n\nManiots, known for their martial qualities, were the very first to join the Greek liberation movement (a claim shared with many other Greek areas) and their contribution proved to be pivotal.

The Messenian Senate was also held in Kalamata. Kolokotronis wanted to attack [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]] and capture the main Turkish city in the Peloponnese. However, Mavromichalis wanted to capture the smaller towns first and then take [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]].

Mahmud II accepted the offer and Ali sent his son in command of the expedition. Meanwhile, the Greeks were in disarray because of political rivalries, which caused a civil war.

The Egyptians, not expecting any resistance, were caught by surprise at this sudden attack and were forced to retreat to a fortified position on the beach where they could receive support from their ships. Eventually, 300 Maniots arrived from other towns, and the Egyptians were forced to either swim to their ships or be slain.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos62\"/> Not only was Ibrahim's defeat costly, as he lost 1,000 men, but his plan to invade and conquer Mani was utterly ruined.

As he advanced towards Polytsaravos (nowadays a deserted place in the southern part of [[Taygetus]]), he was stopped by Theodoros Stathakos, who together with his family of thirteen people was waiting in their tower. Bosinas tried to make Stathakos surrender, and when the latter feigned surrender, Bosinas came towards the tower. However, once Bosinas was within range, Stathakos and his small band killed him.

The inhabitants of the town had sent the women and children to take refuge in the mountains before improving the fortifications they had there. The town militia was reinforced by other Maniots, and soon the defenders numbered 2,500 men.<ref name=\"Kassis41\"/> The Egyptians had trouble advancing to Polytsaravos, because it was surrounded by rocks situated on high ground.<ref name=\"Barrow102\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2000|p=102}}.</ref> As soon as the Arabs arrived, the Maniots rallied around their fortifications and attacked the Arabs.

The Maniots stopped the Egyptians and Ibrahim Pasha who had not been defeated this decisively before. This was the last invasion of Mani by the Egyptians or the Ottomans, as the Peloponnese, central Greece, and some of the Aegean islands were liberated in 1828 after the naval forces of [[Bourbon Restoration]] France under [[Henri de Rigny]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] under [[Edward Codrington]], and the [[Russian Empire]] under [[Login Geiden]] defeated Ibrahim at the [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]] in 1827.\n\n===Republic and Regency===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Petrobey Mavromichalis1.jpg\n| width1 = 130\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Kapodistrias2.jpg\n| width2 = 105\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The imprisonment of [[Petros Mavromichalis]] (left) by [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] (right) led to the assassination of Kapodistrias.\n}}\n\nIn 1831, [[Ioannis Capodistrias]] became governor of Greece.<ref name=\"Kassis41\"/> Capodistrias quarreled with the Mavromichalis clan because the Maniots refused to pay taxes to the new government.<ref name=\"Paroulakis165\">{{harvnb|Paroulakis|1984|p=165}}.</ref>{{Broken footnote|date=February 2020}} Capodistrias requested that [[Tzanis Mavromichalis|Tzanis]], Petros' brother, go to [[Nafplio]], then capital of Greece, and negotiate. As soon as Tzanis arrived, he was arrested and imprisoned. Capodistrias then sent soldiers to Mani and had Petros arrested, imprisoned, and charged with [[high treason]]. His brother Konstantinos, the defender of Nafplio, and Petros' son, [[Georgios Mavromichalis]], were put under house arrest in the capital.<ref name=\"Paroulakis168\">{{harvnb|Paroulakis|1984|p=168}}.</ref>{{Broken footnote|date=February 2020}}\n\nOn September 27, 1831 (October 9 in the [[Gregorian calendar]]), Capodistrias went to attend a church service at the Church of Saint Spyridon. He noticed that Konstantinos and Georgios were waiting at the church doors. As he passed them, he briefly stopped before proceeding into the church. As he was about to step into the church, Konstantinos used his gun and the bullet hit Capodistrias at the back of the head while at the same time Georgios stabbed him through the heart. Capodistrias collapsed into the arms of his attendants. Capodistrias' bodyguard shot Konstantinos as he was running, and Konstantinos was hit by several more bullets before he died. Kostantinos' body was then dragged by an angry mob, who threw it into the sea. Georgios was captured and executed on the island of Bourzi, off the coast of Nafplio, while his father watched.<ref name=\"Paroulakis168\"/>\n\nIn 1833, [[Otto of Greece|Otto von Wittelsbach]], a son of [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] and Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen, became [[King of Greece]] after he was appointed by the [[Great Powers]]. Since he was underage, he had a Council of Regency headed by [[Josef Ludwig von Armansperg]] governing the country for him.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos58\"/> One of the Council's first acts was to try to subdue the unruly Maniots and pull down their towers; another was to free Petros and Tzanis from their prisons.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos35\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=35}}.</ref> The council sent an army of [[Bavarians]] in order to tame Messa Mani.<ref name=\"Kassis43\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=43}}.</ref> They made it to [[Areopoli]], but during the night the Maniots surrounded and captured them, forcing them to leave the area.<ref name=\"Kassis44\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=44}}.</ref>\n\nOn May 14, 1834, four companies of Bavarian troops, assisted by four cannons, besieged the town of [[Petrovouni, Messenia|Petrovouni]]. Ultimately, 800 Maniots from the surrounding towns attacked the Bavarians. The Bavarians were massacred as most of them were either slain by the Maniots or fell into a ravine near the town while escaping. Later that year, an army of 6,000 men with five cannons under the command of General [[Christian von Schmaltz]], assisted by five squadrons of royalist Maniots, once again besieged Petrovouni. When news of an army of 1,000 Maniots was approaching, they retreated to Gytheio.<ref name=\"Kassis44\"/>\n\nThe Council decided that they could not subdue the Maniots by force, so they decided to send a diplomat, Max Feder, with the intention of subduing Mani by playing the love of money against the love of independence. He went to different Maniot families and offered them positions if they supported the king. Many of the Achamnomeri (see note \u03b1 below) and some Megalogenites were convinced by his offers and submitted. However, several of the older families and the poorer Achamnomeri rejected the offer, because the former did not want to be dependent on a king and the latter did not want governors with superior rights.\nIn [[Kitta]], this division caused bloodshed when the king's supporters started fighting the other Maniots under the command of Giorgaros Skylakakos.<ref name=\"Kassis44\"/> Feder soon arrived with his new allies and exploded Skylakakos and all his allies in his towers. Thus the Bavarians managed to annex the whole peninsula to the Greek kingdom.<ref name=\"Kassis45\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=45}}.</ref>\n\n===Late 19th century===\n[[File:Al\u00e8xandros Koumoundo\u00f9ros.JPG|thumb|[[Alexandros Koumoundouros]] (1817\u20131883), born in the Messenian side of Mani, was a political personality famous for his work towards national progress.]]\n\nDuring Otto's rule, blood was spilled in Mani because of the [[vendettas]], which have plagued the area for centuries.<ref name=\"Kassis45\"/> The vendettas continued until 1870, when a Maniot vendetta was halted by the efforts of a regular army with artillery support.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos36\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=36}}.</ref> In 1841, [[Crete]] revolted against the Ottomans.

The Cretans, together with the Maniots, forced the Turks into a fortress, where they besieged them. A combined Ottoman-British fleet managed to subdue the Cretans, but the indefeated Maniots chose to go back to Mani. In 1866, a new revolution sparked in Crete, and 2,000 Maniots under the command of Petropoulakos went to assist their cousins. However, the Cretans were defeated, and the undefeated Maniots again returned to Mani.<ref name=\"Kassis45\"/>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Gythio.JPG|thumb|left|View of the promenade of [[Gytheio]], largest town of Mani.]]\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, Greece was involved with the [[Greek Struggle for Macedonia|Macedonian Struggle]], military conflicts against the Bulgarian organization known as the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]], and Turkish forces in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-occupied [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Many volunteers from Mani took part in the war such as soldiers from the Dritsakos, Koutsonikolakos, Kosteas, Georgopapadakos, Iliopiereas, Loukakos, Kyriakoulakos and Kalantzakos families. The Maniots also took part in the series of wars that followed including the [[Balkan Wars]], [[World War I]], and the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]]. The participation of troops from Mani in these wars under [[Constantine I of Greece]], created strong [[Monarchism|royalist]] feelings amongst Maniots. That is why most Maniots remained loyal to Constantine during the Greek [[National Schism]].<ref name=\"Kassis46\">{{harvnb|Kassis|1979|p=46}}.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the Maniot armed forces significantly helped the [[Hellenic Army]] to win the [[Battle of Greece]]. A Maniot named Colonel [[Konstantinos Davakis]] was among the leaders of the armed forces.<ref name=\"Kassis46\"/> Davakis, in command of the Pindus Detachment, defeated the elite Italian SOF brigate \"Julia\" at the [[Battle of Pindus]] (October 28-November 13, 1940), despite the Italians having more advanced weaponry.\n\nLater, Maniots won another victory when the [[Royal Navy]] of the [[United Kingdom]] defeated the [[Regia Marina]] of Italy in the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] (March 27-March 29, 1941) on Cape [[Tenaro]]. However, [[Nazi Germany]] attacked Greece in order to support the Italians. The Greeks were forced to retreat, and soon Mani revived its forgotten role as a center for refugees. During April 1941, the British started evacuating their troops from Porto Kagio. By the end of that month, Mani and the rest of Greece were under [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Italian and German occupation]].<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos141\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=141}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the occupation, Mani became a stronghold of the [[Security Battalions]], because of the [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] sentiment of the Maniots. The Germans and Italians left Greece in 1944, but as soon as they left the [[Greek Civil War]] began. The armies of the [[Communist Party of Greece]], [[Ellinikos La\u00efkos Apeleftherotikos Stratos|ELAS]], and [[Dimokratikos Stratos Elladas|DSE]], fought against the Hellenic Army and the royalists.<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos38\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=38}}.</ref> Mani never recovered from both wars, and soon many of the young people of Mani left for [[Athens]], the [[United States]], and [[Australia]].<ref name=\"Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos39\">{{harvnb|Greenhalgh|Eliopoulos|1985|p=39}}.</ref>\n\nNowadays, Mani is divided between two regional units: [[Laconia]] and [[Messenia]]. Mani has around 18,000 inhabitants, with the most important and populous town being [[Gytheio]]. Mani's main source of income is tourism. The most famous of the tourist attractions are the [[Pyrgos Dirou|Caves of Diros]], which are two caves that have underwater rivers flowing through them.\n\n==Maniot dialect==\n[[File:Modern Greek dialects en.svg|200px|left|thumb|A map showing the distribution of the Maniot dialect.]]\n\nThe Maniot dialect of Modern Greek has several archaic properties that distinguishes it from most mainstream varieties. One of them, shared with the highly divergent [[Tsakonian language|Tsakonian]] as well as with the old dialects spoken around Athens until the 19th century, is the divergent treatment of historical {{IPA|/y/}} (written <\u03c5>). Although this sound merged to {{IPA|/i/}} everywhere else, these dialects have {{IPA|/u/}} instead (e.g. {{IPA|[\u02c8ksulo]}} versus standard {{IPA|[\u02c8ksilo]}} 'wood').<ref name=\"Trudgill5\">{{harvnb|Trudgill|2003|pp=54\u201359}}.</ref> These varieties are thought to be relic areas of a previously larger areal dialect group that used to share these features and was later divided by the penetration of [[Arvanitika]] settlement in much of its area in the late Middle Ages.\n\nOther features of the Maniot dialect include the palatalization of velar consonants, i.e. the realization of {{IPA|/k, \u0261, x, \u0263/}} as ({{IPA|[t\u0255, d\u0291]}} or {{IPA|[\u0255, \u0291]}} before {{IPA|/i, e, j/}}. This feature is shared with many southern dialects of Greek, especially Cretan.\n\n==Economy==\nThere is little information on the economy of Mani during the early stages of Ottoman dominance of Greece, and what is known of the economy in the 17th and 18th centuries is from foreign observers. In Exo Mani, [[olives]] in great numbers but it was not until the 18th century that olives were widely spread in Mesa Mani. Exports from Exo Mani also included [[pine]] for masts as well [[turpentine]], hides as well as a tanning agent and ''prinokoki'', a crimson-coloured dye. The north-west parts of Mesa Mani were rich in [[morus (plant)|mulberries]] and [[silk]]. Honey is also of superior quality.  Another important part of the Maniot economy was piracy. Nowadays the main industries in Mani are [[agriculture]] and tourism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zorbas.de/maniguide/turkok.html|title=The Economy|accessdate=2008-01-02|work=|author=John Chapman|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105042231/http://www.zorbas.de/maniguide/turkok.html|archive-date=2008-01-05|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Maniatissa.jpg|thumb|left|Woman from Mani.]]\n\n===Dances===\nTwo dances come from Mani: Palio Maniatiko (meaning \"Old Maniot\") and the Modern Maniatiko.

When any strangers come ashore, who do not understand their language, the feigned priests make signes to them, shewing them their bread and wine, which they offer to them for money, by which the strangers being enticed from the sea side (and it may be to sit down and taste their wine) the hidden Manjotts come and make their prey. The priests will seem to be sorry, and endeavor to make the strangers to believe they were altogether ignorant of any such design. So a white flagg is put out, and a treaty held with the ship for their ransome.

The Maniots were famous and fearsome pirates whose ships dominated the Maniot coastline. The Maniots became pirates because Mani was not a very fertile land and the Maniots did not have many natural resources. The Maniots considered piracy a legitimate response to the fact that their land was poor, and it became their main source of income.<ref name=\"Barrow16\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2000|p=16}}.</ref> The pirate raids were not stopped by the local priests of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], who in fact blessed the ships before they left and sometimes accompanied them on raids. Most of the Maniot pirates came from Messa Mani (Inner Mani).<ref name=\"Barrow17\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2000|p=17}}.</ref> The main victims of Maniot pirates were the Ottomans, but the Maniots also targeted ships of powerful European countries.<ref name=\"Kassis38\"/>\n\n===Superstition===\nThe Maniots are a very superstitious people.<ref name=\"Barrow18\">{{harvnb|Barrow|2000|p=18}}.</ref> Maniots mainly believe in [[Witchcraft|witches]], [[demon]]s, [[vampire]]s, and [[ghost]]s.<ref name=\"Barrow18\"/> When [[Henry Herbert, 3rd Earl of Carnarvon]], was touring Mani in 1839, he found a fresh egg by the side of the road and offered it to a Maniot soldier who escorted him, who declined the offer claiming that if a [[hag]] had enchanted it he would have to marry her.<ref name=\"Barrow18\"/> The Maniots thought that certain areas were haunted by demons.<ref name=\"Barrow18\"/>\n\n===Vendettas===\nAnother important aspect of Maniot culture were the [[Feud|vendettas]] which frequently plagued Mani. Usually, the decision to start a vendetta was made at a family gathering. The main aim of a vendetta was usually to wipe out the other family.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm|title=Vendetta|accessdate=2007-01-25|work=Mani: Traditions: Vendetta|author=Venizeleas|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230081926/http://www.mani.org.gr/en/history/venteta.htm|archive-date=2006-12-30|df=}}</ref> The families involved locked themselves in their towers and whenever they got the chance murdered members of the opposing family.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/> The other families in the village normally locked themselves in their towers in order not to get in the way of the fighting.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/>\n\nSome vendettas went on for months, sometimes years. In vendettas, the families could have a truce or ''treva'', if one family needed to attend a religious ceremony or when it was time to harvest the crops.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/> As soon as the treva ended, the killing could resume. Vendettas usually ended when one family was exterminated or when the defeated family left the town. Sometimes families came to terms, and vendettas stopped when the Turks invaded.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/> The longest treva occurred when the Mavromichalis clan declared war on the Turks in 1821. Vendettas continued after the liberation of Greece even though the Regency tried to demolish the towers.<ref name=\"mani.org.gr\"/> The Maniot vendetta is considered the most vicious and ruthless. One of the last vendettas on record required the combined forces of the [[Greek Police]], [[Greek Army]] and [[Greek Navy]] to stop it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cretapost.gr/282097/1906-i-ematiri-venteta-anamesa-se-maniates-ke-kritikous/|title=1906: \u0397 \u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03ae \u03b2\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1 \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b5 \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ac\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 \u2013 Cretapost.gr|author=|date=12 November 2016|website=cretapost.gr|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515195912/http://www.cretapost.gr/282097/1906-i-ematiri-venteta-anamesa-se-maniates-ke-kritikous|archive-date=15 May 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Cuisine===\nLocal specialities:\n\n* ''[[Hilopites]]''\n* ''Kolokythokorfades''\n* ''Lalagides'' or ''Lalagia'' (\u039b\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2)\n* ''Paspalas''\n* ''Regali''\n* ''[[Syglino]]'' (pork meat)\n* ''[[Diples]]'' (dessert)\n\n==Ethnology==\nThe inhabitants of Mani claim to be direct descendants of the ancient [[Sparta]]ns and are considered more \"pure-blooded\" Greeks.

If one of the festivals fell on a Friday, Muhammad would have made sure to read these two Surahs in the prayers.\n\nMuhammad is quoted as saying \"The best day the sun rises over is Friday; on it [[Allah]] created [[Adam in Islam|Adam]].

According to the majority of Sunni schools and some [[Shiite]] jurists, Friday prayer is a religious obligation,<ref>\"Hashemi, Kamran.\" Religious legal traditions, international human rights law and Muslim states. vol. 7. Brill, 2008</ref> but their differences were based on whether its obligation is conditional to the presence of the ruler or his deputy in it or if it is ''wajib'' unconditionally. The [[Hanafi]]s and the [[Imamis]] believe that the presence of the ruler or his deputy is necessary; the Friday prayer is not obligatory if neither of them is present. The Imamis require the ruler to be just (''\u2018adil''); otherwise his presence is equal to his absence. To the Hanafis, his presence is sufficient even if he is not just. The [[Shafi\u2018i]]s, [[Maliki]]s and [[Hanbali]]s attach no significance to the presence of the ruler.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Maghniyyah, M. J.\" The Five Schools of Islamic Law: Al-hanafi.

If one of the festivals fell on a Friday, Muhammad would have made sure to read these two Surahs in the prayers.\n\nMuhammad is quoted as saying \"The best day the sun rises over is Friday; on it [[Allah]] created [[Adam in Islam|Adam]]. On it, he was made to enter [[Jannah|paradise]], on it he was expelled from it, and the [[Islamic eschatology|Last Hour]] will take place on no other day than Friday.\" [Ahmad and at-Tirmithi].\n\nAws ibn Aws, narrated that Muhammad said: \u201cWhoever performs Ghusl on Friday and causes (his wife) to do ghusl, then goes early to the mosque and attends from the beginning of the Khutbah and draws near to the Imam and listens to him attentively, Allah will give him the full reward of fasting all the days of a year and observing night-vigil on each of its nights for every step that he took towards the mosque.\u201d[Ibn Khuzaymah, Ahmad].\n\n==In Sunni Islam==\n[[File:Fatih Mosque-Prishtin\u00eb.jpg|thumb|100px|Jumu'ah prayer in [[Pristina]]]]\nThe ''Jumu'ah'' prayer is half the ''Zuhr'' (dhuhr) prayer, for convenience, preceded by a ''[[khutbah]]'' (a sermon as a technical replacement of the two reduced ''[[raka\u02bf\u0101t]]'' of the ordinary ''Zuhr'' (dhuhr) prayer), and followed by a congregational prayer, led by the [[imam|im\u0101m]].

When the kha\u1e6d\u012bb takes his place on the [[minbar]], a second adhan is made. The kha\u1e6d\u012bb is supposed to deliver two sermons, stopping and sitting briefly between them. In practice, the first sermon is longer and contains most of the content. The second sermon is very brief and concludes with a [[dua]], after which the muezzin calls the [[iqama|iq\u0101mah]].

In his detailed report on the political situation in the country, Haven suggested that the disputed province of Kor\u00e7\u00eb had roughly 60,000 inhabitants, roughly 18 per cent of whom were in favour of Greek sovereignty. Of those 18 per cent, he argued, half were seeking that end out of fear or had been promised material gain in the form of Moslem land and property.... Haven found that the \u2018most intense hatred and loathing exists in Southern Albania for Greece, this hatred being shown by both Orthodox Christians and Musselmen. The cry is \u201cWe are Albanians first and religionists second.\u201d With the exception of comparatively few residents in the province of Coritsa [Kor\u00e7\u00eb] and a few towns in the region of Chimara [Himar\u00eb], the country is absolutely Albanian in sentiment.\"</ref> Haven also noted that in 1919 there was a degree of antipathy shown by both Muslims and Christians in the district toward Greece, and an ethnic affinity among Albanians that, at the time, came before religious affinity.<ref name=Austin93/> At the Peace Conference in Paris, the Greek delegation argued that all Christians in North Epirus, including those that spoke Albanian, should be classified as Greeks because, they argued, their sentiments were Greek, and they had a common religion with Greeks; Lambros Psomas, however, argued that this did not apply in Kor\u00e7\u00eb kaza, where there were many Orthodox Albanian nationalists.<ref>Psomas, Lambros (2008).

C\u00e0 Mau also has several 1- to 3-star hotel restaurants.\n\n==History==\nDuring the [[1st millennium]], the region of the present C\u00e0 Mau province was part of the [[Kingdom of Funan]] (Vietnamese: ''Ph\u00f9 Nam''), which included Laos, Cambodia, parts of eastern Thailand, and southern Vietnam (Vietnamese: ''Nam B\u1ed9''). This region was later conquered by the kingdom of [[Chenla]] (Vietnamese: ''Ch\u00e2n L\u1ea1p'') and the [[Khmer Empire]]. In 1757, the land belonging to C\u00e0 Mau province ({{lang-km|\u1791\u17b9\u1780\u1781\u17d2\u1798\u17c5}}, \"''the black land''\") was ceded by the Khmer king to the [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords|Nguy\u1ec5n lord]] of [[\u0110\u00e0ng Trong]] (central Vietnam) with an early settlement of Vietnamese people. During French rule, C\u00e0 Mau was only a small town. During the [[Republic of Vietnam]], the area nearby C\u00e0 Mau was a stronghold (Vietnamese: ''Chi\u1ebfn khu c\u00e1ch m\u1ea1ng'') for the [[Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng]], a Hanoi-backed guerrilla group fighting the United States Army and the South Vietnamese government during the Vietnam War. After 1975, C\u00e0 Mau was made the administrative seat and the governmental center of [[Minh H\u1ea3i Province]], which included C\u00e0 Mau and [[B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau Province]]. In 1995, C\u00e0 Mau province broke off from Minh H\u1ea3i Province with C\u00e0 Mau as its capital. In 1999, the prime minister by a decree recognized C\u00e0 Mau as a city (Vietnamese: ''Th\u1ecb x\u00e3'') \u2013 C\u00e0 Mau city (3rd class urban area as per Vietnamese law).<ref name=\"UBND\"/> In 2010, the Prime Minister further upgraded C\u00e0 Mau to a 2nd class urban area.<ref>[http://www.nhandan.com.vn/english/life/100810/life_cama.htm Life].

Near C\u00e0 Mau is the [[U Minh]] area with its famous [[mangrove]] forest and swamp cuisine: fish [[hot pot]]s, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Khmer cuisines. C\u00e0 Mau also has several 1- to 3-star hotel restaurants.\n\n==History==\nDuring the [[1st millennium]], the region of the present C\u00e0 Mau province was part of the [[Kingdom of Funan]] (Vietnamese: ''Ph\u00f9 Nam''), which included Laos, Cambodia, parts of eastern Thailand, and southern Vietnam (Vietnamese: ''Nam B\u1ed9''). This region was later conquered by the kingdom of [[Chenla]] (Vietnamese: ''Ch\u00e2n L\u1ea1p'') and the [[Khmer Empire]]. In 1757, the land belonging to C\u00e0 Mau province ({{lang-km|\u1791\u17b9\u1780\u1781\u17d2\u1798\u17c5}}, \"''the black land''\") was ceded by the Khmer king to the [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords|Nguy\u1ec5n lord]] of [[\u0110\u00e0ng Trong]] (central Vietnam) with an early settlement of Vietnamese people. During French rule, C\u00e0 Mau was only a small town. During the [[Republic of Vietnam]], the area nearby C\u00e0 Mau was a stronghold (Vietnamese: ''Chi\u1ebfn khu c\u00e1ch m\u1ea1ng'') for the [[Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng]], a Hanoi-backed guerrilla group fighting the United States Army and the South Vietnamese government during the Vietnam War. After 1975, C\u00e0 Mau was made the administrative seat and the governmental center of [[Minh H\u1ea3i Province]], which included C\u00e0 Mau and [[B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau Province]]. In 1995, C\u00e0 Mau province broke off from Minh H\u1ea3i Province with C\u00e0 Mau as its capital. In 1999, the prime minister by a decree recognized C\u00e0 Mau as a city (Vietnamese: ''Th\u1ecb x\u00e3'') \u2013 C\u00e0 Mau city (3rd class urban area as per Vietnamese law).<ref name=\"UBND\"/> In 2010, the Prime Minister further upgraded C\u00e0 Mau to a 2nd class urban area.<ref>[http://www.nhandan.com.vn/english/life/100810/life_cama.htm Life].
