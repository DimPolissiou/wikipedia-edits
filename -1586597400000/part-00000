It has 1.9 million officers. It is headed by the [[Minister of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Minister of Public Security]]. Prior to 1954, it was known as the '''Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government'''. The Ministry operates the system of [[Public Security Bureau]]s, which are broadly the equivalent of police forces or police stations in other countries. The candidate for the minister of the MPS is nominated by the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]] and approved by the [[National People's Congress]]. As the main domestic security agency in the People's Republic of China, the MPS is the equivalent of the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]] in [[Japan]] or national police in other countries.\n\nWhen it was established in 1949 (after the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]]), the MPS, with [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] General [[Luo Ruiqing]] as its first Minister, was, based on [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Eastern Bloc]] models, responsible for all aspects of security, ranging from regular police work to [[intelligence agency|intelligence]], [[counter-intelligence]] and suppression of [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] political and social groups.<ref>''From the Social Affairs Department to Ministry of Public Security'', in Xuezhi Guo: ''China's Security State: Philosophy, Evolution, and Politics, 2012, Cambridge University Press</ref> [[Military intelligence]] remained with the [[People's Liberation Army General Staff Department|PLA General Staff]], while the [[International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China]] was active in fomenting revolution internationally by funneling weapons, money and resources to various pro-Chinese groups worldwide.<ref name=\"CIA\">{{cite web | url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/CPE/POLO/polo-33.pdf | title=Intelligence Report: The International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist Party | date=December 1971 | access-date=June 17, 2019 | author=Directorate of Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531113802/http://www.foia.cia.gov/CPE/POLO/polo-33.pdf | archive-date=May 31, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHowever, since the creation, in 1983, of the [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of State Security]] (MSS), which took over responsibility for many [[national security]] issues such as domestic and foreign intelligence-gathering and fighting [[espionage]] and [[subversion]], the MPS has focused its efforts on regular law enforcement. [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] have their own security bureaus or agencies and police forces. {{As of|November 2017}}, the Minister of Public Security is [[Zhao Kezhi]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Ministry of Public Security was among the very first government organs of the PRC. It superseded the Ministry of Public Security of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Military Commission, a transitional body created in July 1949 by removing the security service remit from the CCP [[Central Department of Social Affairs]] (CDSA). The ministry began operations on 1 November 1949, at the end of a two-week-long National Conference of Senior Public Security Cadres. Most of its initial staff of less than 500 cadres came from the (former) regional CCP North China Department of Social Affairs. At the national level, its creation signaled the formal abolition of the CDSA. The ministry moved to its present location, in the heart of the one-time foreign legation quarters in Beijing, in the spring of 1950.<ref>Wang Zhongfang, \"Gonganbu shi zemyang chenglide,\" in Zhu Chunlin (ed.)

Subordinate to the MPS are the provincial- and municipal-level PSB and sub-bureaus at the county and urban district levels. At the grassroots level, finally, there are police stations (''paichusuo'') which serve as the direct point of contact between police and ordinary citizens. While public security considerations have weighed heavily at all levels of administration since the founding of the PRC, the police are perceived by some outside observers to wield progressively greater influence at lower levels of government.\n\nThe organization of local public security stations may be inferred from the tasks with which the police are charged. Generally, each police station has sections assigned to cover census and household registration matters, pretrial investigations, welfare, traffic control, and other activities. Each also has a detention center.\n\n=== Departmental structure ===\nAt the time of its creation, the Ministry of Public Security had a simple departmental structure comprising one general office and six functional directorates, numbered sequentially and responsible for political security, economic security, public order and administration, border security, armed security, and personnel. Today's ministry is organized into the following departments: \n* Central Office, \n* Supervision, \n* Personnel & Training, \n* Public Relations, \n* Economic Crime Investigation, \n* Public Order Administration, \n* Border Control, \n* Criminal Investigation, \n* Exit & Entry Administration, \n* Fire Control, \n* Security Protection, \n* Public Information Network Security Supervision, \n* Penitentiary Administration, \n* Traffic Control, \n* Legal Affairs, \n* International Cooperation, \n* Equipment and Finance, \n* Drug Control, \n* Science & Technology, \n* Counter-terrorism, and \n* Info-communications.\n\nRailway, navigation, civil aviation, forestry and anti-smuggling public security departments are under the dual leadership of their superior administration and the MPS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mps.gov.cn/English/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208010431/http://www.mps.gov.cn/english/index.htm |archivedate=2012-12-08 }}</ref>\n\n== Responsibilities and operations ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nIn the 1980s the public security station&mdash;the police element in closest contact with the people&mdash;was supervised by the public security subbureau as well as by local governments and procuratorates. The procuratorate could assume direct responsibility for any case that it chose, and it supervised investigations in those cases in which the public security station was allowed to conduct investigations. A great deal of coordination occurred among the public security organs, the procuratorates, and the courts, so that a trial was unlikely to produce a surprise outcome.\n\nThe public security station generally had considerably broader responsibilities than a police station in the West, involving itself in every aspect of the district people's lives. In a rural area a station typically has a chief, a deputy chief, a small administrative staff, and a small police force. In an urban area it usually has a greater number of administrative staff members and seven to eighteen patrolmen. Its criminal law activities included investigation, apprehension, interrogation, and temporary detention. The station's household section maintained a registry of all persons living in the area. Births, deaths, marriages, and divorces were recorded and confirmed through random household checks. The station regulated all hotels and required visitors who remained beyond a certain number of days to register. All theaters, cinemas, radio equipment, and printing presses also were registered with the local public security station, permitting it to regulate gatherings and censor information effectively. It also regulated the possession, transportation, and use of all explosives, guns, ammunition, and poisons.\n\nAnother important police function was controlling change of residence. Without such controls, large numbers of rural residents undoubtedly would move to the overcrowded cities in search of better living standards, work, or education. In April 1984 the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] issued the [[Tentative Regulations Governing People's Republic of China Resident Identity]], this became the identification card of the People's Republic of China. The regulations, implemented over a period of years, required all residents over sixteen years of age, except active-duty members of the [[People's Liberation Army]] and the [[People's Armed Police]] and inmates serving [[prison]] sentences, to be issued [[resident identity card]]s by the MPS. The identification card indicates the name, sex, nationality, ethnicity, date of birth, and address of the bearer. Cards for persons sixteen to twenty-five years of age were valid for ten years; those for persons between twenty-five and forty-five were valid for twenty years; and persons over forty-five were issued permanent cards. As of early 1987, only 70 million people had been issued identity cards, well below the national goal. Also, even those with resident identity cards preferred to use other forms of identification.\n\n== Criminal procedure powers ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\nPublic security officials also made extensive use of their authority to impose administrative sanctions through two sets of documents. These were the 1957 Regulations on [[re-education through labor]], which were reissued in 1979 with amendments (abolished 2015), and the 1957 [[Regulations Governing Offenses Against Public Order]], which were rescinded and replaced in 1986 by regulations of the same name. Offenders under the Regulations on Reeducation Through Labor might include \"[[Vagrancy (people)|vagabonds]], people who have no proper occupation, and people who repeatedly breach public order.\" The police could apprehend such individuals and sentence them to reeducation through labor with the approval of local labor-training administration committees. The 1957 regulations placed no limit on the length of sentences, but beginning in the early 1960s sentences of three or four years were the norm. The 1979 amended Regulations, however, limited the length of reeducation through labor to three years with the possibility of extensions in extraordinary cases. The Regulations Governing Offenses Against Public Order empowered the police to admonish, fine, or detain people for up to fifteen days. Goods illegally in the possession of an offender were to be confiscated, and payment was imposed for damages or hospital fees in the event that injury had been caused.\n\nThe criminal laws in force after January 1, 1980, restricted police powers regarding arrests, investigations, and searches. A public security official or a citizen could apprehend a suspect under emergency conditions, but a court or procuratorate was required to approve the arrest. The accused had to be questioned within twenty-four hours and his or her family or work unit notified of the detention \"except in circumstances where notification would hinder the investigation or there was no way to notify them.\" Any premeditated arrest required a warrant from a court or procuratorate. The time that an accused could be held pending investigation was limited to three to seven days, and incarceration without due process was made illegal.\n\nTwo officials were needed to conduct a criminal investigation. They were required to show identification and, apparently, to inform the accused of the crime allegedly committed before he or she was questioned. The suspect could refuse to answer only those questions irrelevant to the case. Torture was rendered illegal.\n\nThe 1980 laws also provided that in conjunction with an arrest the police could conduct an emergency search; otherwise, a warrant was required. They had the right to search the person, property, and residence of an accused and the person of any injured party. They could intercept mail belonging to the accused and order an autopsy whenever cause of death was unclear.\n\nIn July 1980 the government approved new regulations governing police use of weapons and force. Police personnel could use their batons only in self-defense or when necessary to subdue or prevent the escape of violent criminals or rioters. Lethal weapons, such as [[pistols]], could be used if necessary to stop violent riots, to lessen the overall loss of life, or to subdue surrounded but still resisting criminals. The regulations even governed use of sirens, police lights, and whistles.\n\n== Public relations ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe relationship between the police officers assigned to neighborhood patrols and the people was close. Police officers lived in a neighborhood on a long-term assignment and were expected to know all the residents on a personal basis. Their task was not only to prevent and punish crime but to promote desirable behavior by counseling and acting as role models. These socially responsible aspects of the police officer's duties were constant responsibilities, and the bond between the public security units and the people was strengthened annually by means of \"cherish-the-people\" months, during which the police officer made a special effort to help the local people, especially the aged and infirm.\n\n== Recruitment ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\nPolice are officially drawn from every segment of the population without restriction as to sex or ethnic origin. Selection is based on political loyalty, intelligence, and health, as it is for the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]]. There is at least one police school in every provincial-level unit, and others are operated by municipalities. Usually those police designated for leadership positions attend the police schools, and patrolmen are trained at the unit and on the job. Legal training is emphasized as a method of improving the quality of the police forces. In 1985 three institutions of higher learning for police personnel were established&mdash;the [[Chinese People's Public Security University]], the [[University of Police Officers]], and the [[Institute of Criminal Police]]&mdash;offering more than twenty special courses. Students are recruited from the pool of senior middle-school graduates under twenty-two years of age, with a waiver to twenty-five years of age for those who have a minimum of two years' experience in public security work.\n\n== Firearms ==\nLocal [[municipal police]] under the MPS formally were usually unarmed with firearms routinely in contrast to the soldiers of the [[People's Armed Police]] (PAP), however they are armed with [[expandable baton]]s and [[incapacitant spray]]s. Sometimes, [[multitool|multiple use tactical knives]] are issued to the policemen.\n\nA decision has been taken to train in the use of sidearms to all frontline MPS personnel since 2006. The [[9\u00d719mm]] [[Trigger (firearms)|double-action]] [[revolver]] manufactured by the [[Norinco|China North Industries Corporation]] <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://world.guns.ru/handguns/hg199-e.htm |title=9mm Chinese Police revolver |access-date=2008-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406130126/http://www.world.guns.ru/handguns/hg199-e.htm |archive-date=2008-04-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> are issued to frontline personnel, and officers armed them routinely\n\nFor more firepower, [[detective]]s and special units are routinely armed with [[Type 77 pistol|Type 77]] and [[QSZ-92]] [[semi-automatic pistol]]s.

It has 1.9 million officers. It is headed by the [[Minister of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Minister of Public Security]]. Prior to 1954, it was known as the '''Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government'''. The Ministry operates the system of [[Public Security Bureau]]s, which are broadly the equivalent of police forces or police stations in other countries. The candidate for the minister of the MPS is nominated by the [[Premier of the People's Republic of China]] and approved by the [[National People's Congress]]. As the main domestic security agency in the People's Republic of China, the MPS is the equivalent of the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|National Police Agency]] in [[Japan]] or national police in other countries.\n\nWhen it was established in 1949 (after the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]]), the MPS, with [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] General [[Luo Ruiqing]] as its first Minister, was, based on [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[Eastern Bloc]] models, responsible for all aspects of security, ranging from regular police work to [[intelligence agency|intelligence]], [[counter-intelligence]] and suppression of [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] political and social groups.<ref>''From the Social Affairs Department to Ministry of Public Security'', in Xuezhi Guo: ''China's Security State: Philosophy, Evolution, and Politics, 2012, Cambridge University Press</ref> [[Military intelligence]] remained with the [[People's Liberation Army General Staff Department|PLA General Staff]], while the [[International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China]] was active in fomenting revolution internationally by funneling weapons, money and resources to various pro-Chinese groups worldwide.<ref name=\"CIA\">{{cite web | url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/CPE/POLO/polo-33.pdf | title=Intelligence Report: The International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist Party | date=December 1971 | access-date=June 17, 2019 | author=Directorate of Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531113802/http://www.foia.cia.gov/CPE/POLO/polo-33.pdf | archive-date=May 31, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHowever, since the creation, in 1983, of the [[Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of State Security]] (MSS), which took over responsibility for many [[national security]] issues such as domestic and foreign intelligence-gathering and fighting [[espionage]] and [[subversion]], the MPS has focused its efforts on regular law enforcement. [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] have their own security bureaus or agencies and police forces. {{As of|November 2017}}, the Minister of Public Security is [[Zhao Kezhi]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Ministry of Public Security was among the very first government organs of the PRC. It superseded the Ministry of Public Security of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Military Commission, a transitional body created in July 1949 by removing the security service remit from the CCP [[Central Department of Social Affairs]] (CDSA). The ministry began operations on 1 November 1949, at the end of a two-week-long National Conference of Senior Public Security Cadres. Most of its initial staff of less than 500 cadres came from the (former) regional CCP North China Department of Social Affairs. At the national level, its creation signaled the formal abolition of the CDSA. The ministry moved to its present location, in the heart of the one-time foreign legation quarters in Beijing, in the spring of 1950.<ref>Wang Zhongfang, \"Gonganbu shi zemyang chenglide,\" in Zhu Chunlin (ed.)

Subordinate to the MPS are the provincial- and municipal-level PSB and sub-bureaus at the county and urban district levels. At the grassroots level, finally, there are police stations (''paichusuo'') which serve as the direct point of contact between police and ordinary citizens. While public security considerations have weighed heavily at all levels of administration since the founding of the PRC, the police are perceived by some outside observers to wield progressively greater influence at lower levels of government.\n\nThe organization of local public security stations may be inferred from the tasks with which the police are charged. Generally, each police station has sections assigned to cover census and household registration matters, pretrial investigations, welfare, traffic control, and other activities. Each also has a detention center.\n\n=== Departmental structure ===\nAt the time of its creation, the Ministry of Public Security had a simple departmental structure comprising one general office and six functional directorates, numbered sequentially and responsible for political security, economic security, public order and administration, border security, armed security, and personnel. Today's ministry is organized into the following departments: \n* Central Office, \n* Supervision, \n* Personnel & Training, \n* Public Relations, \n* Economic Crime Investigation, \n* Public Order Administration, \n* Border Control, \n* Criminal Investigation, \n* Exit & Entry Administration, \n* Fire Control, \n* Security Protection, \n* Public Information Network Security Supervision, \n* Penitentiary Administration, \n* Traffic Control, \n* Legal Affairs, \n* International Cooperation, \n* Equipment and Finance, \n* Drug Control, \n* Science & Technology, \n* Counter-terrorism, and \n* Info-communications.\n\nRailway, navigation, civil aviation, forestry and anti-smuggling public security departments are under the dual leadership of their superior administration and the MPS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mps.gov.cn/English/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208010431/http://www.mps.gov.cn/english/index.htm |archivedate=2012-12-08 }}</ref>\n\n== Responsibilities and operations ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nIn the 1980s the public security station&mdash;the police element in closest contact with the people&mdash;was supervised by the public security subbureau as well as by local governments and procuratorates. The procuratorate could assume direct responsibility for any case that it chose, and it supervised investigations in those cases in which the public security station was allowed to conduct investigations. A great deal of coordination occurred among the public security organs, the procuratorates, and the courts, so that a trial was unlikely to produce a surprise outcome.\n\nThe public security station generally had considerably broader responsibilities than a police station in the West, involving itself in every aspect of the district people's lives. In a rural area a station typically has a chief, a deputy chief, a small administrative staff, and a small police force. In an urban area it usually has a greater number of administrative staff members and seven to eighteen patrolmen. Its criminal law activities included investigation, apprehension, interrogation, and temporary detention. The station's household section maintained a registry of all persons living in the area. Births, deaths, marriages, and divorces were recorded and confirmed through random household checks. The station regulated all hotels and required visitors who remained beyond a certain number of days to register. All theaters, cinemas, radio equipment, and printing presses also were registered with the local public security station, permitting it to regulate gatherings and censor information effectively. It also regulated the possession, transportation, and use of all explosives, guns, ammunition, and poisons.\n\nAnother important police function was controlling change of residence. Without such controls, large numbers of rural residents undoubtedly would move to the overcrowded cities in search of better living standards, work, or education. In April 1984 the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] issued the [[Tentative Regulations Governing People's Republic of China Resident Identity]], this became the identification card of the People's Republic of China. The regulations, implemented over a period of years, required all residents over sixteen years of age, except active-duty members of the [[People's Liberation Army]] and the [[People's Armed Police]] and inmates serving [[prison]] sentences, to be issued [[resident identity card]]s by the MPS. The identification card indicates the name, sex, nationality, ethnicity, date of birth, and address of the bearer. Cards for persons sixteen to twenty-five years of age were valid for ten years; those for persons between twenty-five and forty-five were valid for twenty years; and persons over forty-five were issued permanent cards. As of early 1987, only 70 million people had been issued identity cards, well below the national goal. Also, even those with resident identity cards preferred to use other forms of identification.\n\n== Criminal procedure powers ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\nPublic security officials also made extensive use of their authority to impose administrative sanctions through two sets of documents. These were the 1957 Regulations on [[re-education through labor]], which were reissued in 1979 with amendments (abolished 2015), and the 1957 [[Regulations Governing Offenses Against Public Order]], which were rescinded and replaced in 1986 by regulations of the same name. Offenders under the Regulations on Reeducation Through Labor might include \"[[Vagrancy (people)|vagabonds]], people who have no proper occupation, and people who repeatedly breach public order.\" The police could apprehend such individuals and sentence them to reeducation through labor with the approval of local labor-training administration committees. The 1957 regulations placed no limit on the length of sentences, but beginning in the early 1960s sentences of three or four years were the norm. The 1979 amended Regulations, however, limited the length of reeducation through labor to three years with the possibility of extensions in extraordinary cases. The Regulations Governing Offenses Against Public Order empowered the police to admonish, fine, or detain people for up to fifteen days. Goods illegally in the possession of an offender were to be confiscated, and payment was imposed for damages or hospital fees in the event that injury had been caused.\n\nThe criminal laws in force after January 1, 1980, restricted police powers regarding arrests, investigations, and searches. A public security official or a citizen could apprehend a suspect under emergency conditions, but a court or procuratorate was required to approve the arrest. The accused had to be questioned within twenty-four hours and his or her family or work unit notified of the detention \"except in circumstances where notification would hinder the investigation or there was no way to notify them.\" Any premeditated arrest required a warrant from a court or procuratorate. The time that an accused could be held pending investigation was limited to three to seven days, and incarceration without due process was made illegal.\n\nTwo officials were needed to conduct a criminal investigation. They were required to show identification and, apparently, to inform the accused of the crime allegedly committed before he or she was questioned. The suspect could refuse to answer only those questions irrelevant to the case. Torture was rendered illegal.\n\nThe 1980 laws also provided that in conjunction with an arrest the police could conduct an emergency search; otherwise, a warrant was required. They had the right to search the person, property, and residence of an accused and the person of any injured party. They could intercept mail belonging to the accused and order an autopsy whenever cause of death was unclear.\n\nIn July 1980 the government approved new regulations governing police use of weapons and force. Police personnel could use their batons only in self-defense or when necessary to subdue or prevent the escape of violent criminals or rioters. Lethal weapons, such as [[pistols]], could be used if necessary to stop violent riots, to lessen the overall loss of life, or to subdue surrounded but still resisting criminals. The regulations even governed use of sirens, police lights, and whistles.\n\n== Public relations ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe relationship between the police officers assigned to neighborhood patrols and the people was close. Police officers lived in a neighborhood on a long-term assignment and were expected to know all the residents on a personal basis. Their task was not only to prevent and punish crime but to promote desirable behavior by counseling and acting as role models. These socially responsible aspects of the police officer's duties were constant responsibilities, and the bond between the public security units and the people was strengthened annually by means of \"cherish-the-people\" months, during which the police officer made a special effort to help the local people, especially the aged and infirm.\n\n== Recruitment ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\nPolice are officially drawn from every segment of the population without restriction as to sex or ethnic origin. Selection is based on political loyalty, intelligence, and health, as it is for the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]]. There is at least one police school in every provincial-level unit, and others are operated by municipalities. Usually those police designated for leadership positions attend the police schools, and patrolmen are trained at the unit and on the job. Legal training is emphasized as a method of improving the quality of the police forces. In 1985 three institutions of higher learning for police personnel were established&mdash;the [[Chinese People's Public Security University]], the [[University of Police Officers]], and the [[Institute of Criminal Police]]&mdash;offering more than twenty special courses. Students are recruited from the pool of senior middle-school graduates under twenty-two years of age, with a waiver to twenty-five years of age for those who have a minimum of two years' experience in public security work.\n\n== Firearms ==\nLocal [[municipal police]] under the MPS formally were usually unarmed with firearms routinely in contrast to the soldiers of the [[People's Armed Police]] (PAP), however they are armed with [[expandable baton]]s and [[incapacitant spray]]s. Sometimes, [[multitool|multiple use tactical knives]] are issued to the policemen.\n\nA decision has been taken to train in the use of sidearms to all frontline MPS personnel since 2006. The [[9\u00d719mm]] [[Trigger (firearms)|double-action]] [[revolver]] manufactured by the [[Norinco|China North Industries Corporation]] <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://world.guns.ru/handguns/hg199-e.htm |title=9mm Chinese Police revolver |access-date=2008-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406130126/http://www.world.guns.ru/handguns/hg199-e.htm |archive-date=2008-04-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> are issued to frontline personnel, and officers armed them routinely\n\nFor more firepower, [[detective]]s and special units are routinely armed with [[Type 77 pistol|Type 77]] and [[QSZ-92]] [[semi-automatic pistol]]s.

It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

Through Kaede, they meet with Tess and Andrew \"Razor\" DeSoto, a Republic Commander [[double agent|doubling]] as the leader of the Patriots. Razor offers Day a prosthetic leg and protection in exchange for assassinating the new Elector Primo, Anden Stavropoulos, who has recently succeeded his deceased father. To execute the task, June will need an audience with Anden at [[Denver]] to falsify the time and place of the assassination and convince him to seek \"protection\" at the actual place of assassination. \n \n\u2212\t\nl soldiers pursue them; heading across the war zone straight towards Denver in a jet, though Kaede is killed in the process. Day successfully reaches the City Hall and pledges his support for Anden. Thanks to this, Anden gains the trust of the masses and manages to command the Army to capture Razor, the traitorous Senators, and most of their supporters.\n \n\u2212\t\t \n\u2212\t\nWhile he is reunited with the now-blind Eden, Day is diagnosed with a [[terminal illness]] due to the Republic's experimentation on him five years prior. Meanwhile, June is offered by Anden a training program for the position of Senator Princeps\u2013the head of the Senate. She meets with Day after his release from the hospital, only to find out that Day, not wanting his illness to hinder June's future, plans to distance himself from her. He quickly leaves the apartment, but not before giving the agonized June a parting kiss.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''June Iparis''', the Republic's fifteen year old prodigy who scored a perfect 1500 on her Trial, the Republic's mandatory test system. Born into an elite family, her parents were mysteriously killed in a car crash, leaving Metias, her older brother, to care for her. When Metias is murdered and Day is the prime suspect, June sets out to find him but ends up slowly falling in love with Day. Her first encounter with Day was a ruse to find out his true identity, only seeking revenge for her brother's death. She's very analytical and smart, able to keenly survive on the streets, and a bit of an uptight person. She has long, dark brown hair usually tied back in a high ponytail. She has dark brown eyes with golden flecks in them.\n* '''Daniel 'Day' Altan Wing''', the sixteen year old legend born in the slums of the Republic. Day is the Republic's most-wanted criminal and the prime suspect of Metias's murder. He is a mix between Mongolian/Caucasian with long, light blond hair and bright blue eyes. He also has a limp in his left leg and an \"imperfection\" (a lighter patch of blue) in one eye from when the Republic experimented on him. Day is described as being extremely agile, even more so than June. He, like June, is confident and stubborn. He also scored a perfect 1500 during his Trial, but was lied to from the Republic, being told he scored 674 (45%). In ''Prodigy'', Day has his injured leg replaced by a mostly metal prosthesis, and he also discovers that he has a terminal illness.\n* '''Metias Iparis''', June's older brother, who was killed early in the previous novel. He was murdered by Thomas, who was acting on orders from Commander Jameson. He was twenty-seven when he died, and had dark hair and eyes like June. Metias was a brilliant hacker who turned away from the Republic after making several shocking discoveries. \n* '''Thomas''', Metias's old friend who acted like he was in love with June (and tries to kiss her) and has a special hatred against Day. It is later indicated that Thomas was Metias's murderer. June comes to believe that her brother was in love with Thomas, but does not know if the feeling was reciprocated.\n* '''Eden Bataar Wing''', Day's younger brother who caught a mutated version of the plague. In ''Prodigy'', Eden to be used as a biological weapon. The new Elector releases Eden and is no longer required to take the Trial, but he has lost his sight. \n* '''John Suren Wing''', Day's older brother who was killed at the end of [[Legend (Lu novel)|Legend]] by the Republic's firing squad in a sacrifice to save both Day and June.\n* '''Commander Jameson''', June's hard-core commander and sort of another parent to June, being that June's brother and parents are dead. In ''Prodigy'' it is revealed that Jameson was working with the head of the Patriots to remove the new Elector. \n* '''Tess''', Day's thirteen-year-old partner in crime and caretaker. Tess was abandoned by her parents and taken in by Day when she was only ten. She goes missing after Day is taken into custody by June but is later discovered to have joined the Patriots. In ''Prodigy'', Tess is working to become a Medic. Tess also developed a crush on Day, and her jealousy and suspicion of June add tension to her relationship with Day, who views her more as a sibling than someone he could be interested in romantically.\n* '''Chian''', Los Angeles's head Trial administrator. He administered June's and Day's Trial and used to be Metias's mentor.\n* '''Kaede''', A Patriot known to be involved in 'Skiz' fights.  She helps Day and June escape the Republic after June pays her a large sum of money. It is revealed Kaede was a Colonies fighter pilot who was let go after harming an abusive peer. She insists she's in it for the money, but at points implies she just wants unity in North America. She is shot and killed upon crashing a Colonies jet into Denver. \n* '''Ollie''', June's loyal white shepherd dog who helps coax her through the tragic period of Metias' death. Thomas uses Ollie to search for June in ''Prodigy'', and at the end of the story she is reunited with him. \n* '''Senator Kamion''', A Senator in the Republic government who opposes the new Elector. \n* '''Anden Stavropoulos''', After the death of his father, Anden became the new Elector, the head of the Republic. However, Anden's positions on many policies differed vastly from his father, and the Republic Senate sought to have him removed. It is shown that he is romantically interested in June.\n* '''Baxter''', A Patriot Runner who bullies Day because he trusts June (Baxter believes that June is a double agent). He was also thought to have some relationship with Tess, but ended it after Day and Baxter had a fight.\n* '''Pascao''', The undisputed leader of the Patriot Runners.\n* '''Dr. Sadhwani''', She performs the lie detector test on June, which she narrowly passed.\n* '''Commander Andrew \"Razor\" DeSoto''', Leader of the Patriots, but also a former Republic soldier. Razor instrumented a plan to remove the Elector Anden for the Republic Senate, whereupon he would be made the new Elector.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe novel has been warmly received by critics. In ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', Sara Scribner wrote, \"Marie Lu has beaten the curse with 'Prodigy,' the second book in the 'Legend' series...Unlike 'The Hunger Games,' which delivers its adrenaline rush by giving kids bows and arrows, this series' power is derived through its layered atmospheres and the way its characters reflect and fight their worlds \u2014 and one another. With 'Prodigy,' Lu proves that a Book Two needn't play second fiddle, providing intrigue and deep pleasure all its own.\"<ref>Sara Scribner, \"In 'Prodigy,' Marie Lu burnishes her 'Legend' series,\" ''The Los Angeles Times'', 24 January 2013.</ref> The trade publication ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' gave ''Prodigy'' a starred review. \"June and Day were once divided by ignorance and circumstance; now they are held apart by principle and choice.

With 'Prodigy,' Lu proves that a Book Two needn't play second fiddle, providing intrigue and deep pleasure all its own.\"<ref>Sara Scribner, \"In 'Prodigy,' Marie Lu burnishes her 'Legend' series,\" ''The Los Angeles Times'', 24 January 2013.</ref> The trade publication ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' gave ''Prodigy'' a starred review. \"June and Day were once divided by ignorance and circumstance; now they are held apart by principle and choice.
