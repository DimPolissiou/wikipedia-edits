From 1988-1996 the Colts played in Stonefield Northpark and from 1997-2000 played in [[Duquesne, Pennsylvania|Duquesne]]. Recent Locations include, [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania|Uniontown]], [[Chartiers Valley School District|Chartiers Valley]] and [[Carlynton School District|Carlynton]]. The Colts were previously members of the American, [[North American Football League]], and Regional American Football League before Edward Brosky formed the Grassroots Football League in 2009. The Colts played in the Semi-Pro Football League from 2010-2014 before joining the Gridiron Developmental Football League for the 2015 season. They also played at [[Chartiers Valley School District|Chartiers Valley]] for the 2015 season.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Brosky struck a deal with the [[Northgate School District]]. It was during this time that two notables were linked with the team; [[WTAE-TV]] field reporter Sheldon Ingram played in the defensive backfield while future music video director Matt Dilmore served as the team's official announcer.\n\nThe Colts draw talent from the area high schools and local colleges including: [[Allegheny College]], [[Bethany College (West Virginia)|Bethany College]], [[California University of Pennsylvania]], [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Duquesne University]], [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]], [[University of Pittsburgh]], [[Robert Morris College]], [[Slippery Rock University]], [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Washington & Jefferson College]], and [[James Madison University]] in Virginia.\n\nThe Colts describe themselves as a \"throwback team\" based on a strong work ethic and personal values.<ref>{{cite news |title=West Xtra: Colts lineman shines at playing both ways| first=Nicholas | last=Tolomeo |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/other-sports/2014/07/24/Colts-lineman-shines-at-playing-both-ways/stories/201407240112|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=June 24, 2014|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}</ref> The team has been in several communities throughout its history.
