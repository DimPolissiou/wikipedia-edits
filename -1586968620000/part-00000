Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nsecond in 1721,the kolis of [[Pethapur State|Pethapur]] challenged the mughal authority. They plundered the merchants and villages. The governor of [[Kheda]] was ordered to subdue the kolis but in the batyle at pethapur in 1721 kolis killed governor ''Kasim Ali Khan'' in action. Third in 1729, the kolis of [[Radhanpur]] revolted against the mughals in gujarat. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] of radhanpur assisted the mughals in gujarat and he was appointed as the governor of Radhanpur with the title of ''Jawan Marad Khan'' and founded the [[Radhanpur State]] as independent ruler. Kolis of his territory were in revolt wind already against mughals. Kolis infested the roads, blocked the minor ways, plundered the villages and challenged the authority. The first [[Nawab]] of radhanpur Jawan Marad Khan was ordered by sultan to put down the kolis. Khan marched against kolis of ''Balor'' in his territory and happened a critical struggle between nawab and kolis. But nawab was killed in action by the kolis of balor.<ref name=\":24\" /><ref name=\":23\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurrence, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. According to the historical anthropology [[Susan Bayly]] of [[University of Cambridge]] states that this is the [[Kshatriya]] of [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and uppar [[India]]. Until tye 1940, kolis were considered as criminal stocks and mostly used for police and military by rulers and authorities. Some of them engaged in marketing as [[Vaishya]] and a large number engaged in agriculture and as soldier. They have gained prominence from islamic india and were political strong and petty rulers from koli community were vested the titles of [[Thakor]] and [[Girasia]] which means ''Girasdar'' or collector of tax from his territory.<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite book|last=Bayly|first=Susan|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=HbAjKR_iHogC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age|date=2001-02-22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79842-6|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mughal time, kolis were most notorious for rulers. so a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] chronicler mentioned that the kolis of gujarat raised against mughal rule.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThree of the major uprisings of kolis were in the years of 1694, 1721 and 1729 against muslim rule, the kolis of gujarat continually challenged the mighal authority. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] Muhammad Mubariz Khan (ancestor of [[Junagadh State]] family) of pasthoon tribe was appointed as governor of the [[Vadnagar]] and ordered to control the koli's turbulent activities. Kolis were in rebellion against muslim rule so Mubariz khan commanded the imperial army against kolis of sampra was but he was killed by kolis of that village.\n\nsecond in 1721,the kolis of [[Pethapur State|Pethapur]] challenged the mughal authority. They plundered the merchants and villages. The governor of [[Kheda]] was ordered to subdue the kolis but in the batyle at pethapur in 1721 kolis killed governor ''Kasim Ali Khan'' in action. Third in 1729, the kolis of [[Radhanpur]] revolted against the mughals in gujarat. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] of radhanpur assisted the mughals in gujarat and he was appointed as the governor of Radhanpur with the title of ''Jawan Marad Khan'' and founded the [[Radhanpur State]] as independent ruler. Kolis of his territory were in revolt wind already against mughals. Kolis infested the roads, blocked the minor ways, plundered the villages and challenged the authority. The first [[Nawab]] of radhanpur Jawan Marad Khan was ordered by sultan to put down the kolis. Khan marched against kolis of ''Balor'' in his territory and happened a critical struggle between nawab and kolis. But nawab was killed in action by the kolis of balor.<ref name=\":24\" /><ref name=\":23\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurrence, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis.

It was the eighth [[Tropical cyclone naming|named storm]], third hurricane, and second major hurricane \u2013 [[Category 3 hurricane|Category 3]] or higher on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]] \u2013 of the [[2019 Atlantic hurricane season|2019 Atlantic season]]. Humberto formed on September&nbsp;13 from the prolonged interaction of a [[tropical wave]] and an [[Trough (meteorology)|upper-level trough]], then paralleled the eastern coastline of [[Florida]] through September&nbsp;16 before turning sharply northeastward. A generally favorable environment allowed Humberto to become a hurricane that day, and the storm further strengthened to reach peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane on September&nbsp;18. After its center passed within 65&nbsp;[[mile]]s (100&nbsp;[[Kilometre|km]]) of Bermuda around 00:00 [[UTC]] on September 19, the system encountered stronger [[wind shear]] and drier air. Stripped of its deep thunderstorm activity, the system transitioned to a potent [[extratropical cyclone]] early on September&nbsp;20.\n\nForming on the heels of [[Hurricane Dorian]] two weeks prior, Humberto proved far less destructive throughout [[the Bahamas]], producing only some squally weather. The eastern coastline of Florida saw tropical storm-force wind gusts, choppy seas, and light rainfall. [[Rip currents]] killed one person in Florida and another in [[North Carolina]]. In Bermuda, coastal flooding and rainfall were limited by low astronomical [[tide]]s and Humberto's quick forward motion. However, peak surface winds of around 110&nbsp;mph (177&nbsp;km/h), with higher gusts, caused widespread damage to trees, roofs, crops, and power lines, most notably on the western end of the island chain. Some 90% of Bermuda's banana crop was lost. As many as 600 buildings suffered roof damage, while 27,900 customers were left without power; though most of the network was quickly repaired, some electric outages persisted for at least 10 days. [[L.F. Wade International Airport]] and the [[Bermuda Weather Service]] campus both suffered property damage. In total, the hurricane wrought over $25&nbsp;million in damage throughout Bermuda. [[2019 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Jerry|Hurricane Jerry]] to the south briefly posed a threat to the territory as cleanup from Humberto got underway, but it ultimately dissipated with no ill-effects.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{Storm path|Humberto 2019 track.png|alt=Map of the western Atlantic Ocean depicting the track of Hurricane Humberto.}}\nThe origins of Humberto trace back to a [[tropical wave]] that exited the western coast of Africa on August&nbsp;27, 2019. Accompanied by little [[Atmospheric convection|convective activity]], the disturbance moved westward across the Atlantic for several days. On September&nbsp;4, the wave encountered a mid- to upper-level [[Trough (meteorology)|trough of low pressure]] several hundred miles east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. Resistance from the trough split the wave in two; the southern portion proceeded through the [[Windward Islands]], while the northern portion of the wave moved toward the northwest in tandem with the trough. As the trough became [[Trough (meteorology)#Positively/negatively tilted|negatively tilted]], or oriented northwest-to-southeast, strengthening [[anticyclone|anticyclonic]] flow on its east side promoted periods of enhanced convection close to the tropical wave. These convective bursts, largely driven by [[diurnal cycle]]s, led to the development of a broad surface [[Low-pressure area|low]] on the morning of September&nbsp;12 as the disturbance turned north-northwest through the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]].<ref name=\"TCR\">{{cite report|author=Stacy R.

Some [[Dvorak technique|satellite intensity estimates]] supported Category&nbsp;4 status, and a [[dropsonde]] in the southern eyewall measured winds aloft of 159&nbsp;mph (256&nbsp;km/h), in addition to surface winds of 131&nbsp;mph (211&nbsp;km/h). However, these values were recorded at two-second intervals and, consequently, were not representative of sustained winds. Additionally, [[weather radar]] imagery from Bermuda indicated a quickly eroding eyewall. Therefore, the strongest winds were likely the result of [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] processes producing a wind maximum akin to a [[sting jet]], which would not be indicative of Humberto's true strength as a tropical cyclone.<ref name=\"TCR\"/> As Humberto accelerated ahead of the encroaching upper-level trough to its west, it encountered even stronger upper-level winds and drier air that together triggered a weakening trend. By 00:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;20, the system had become devoid of organized deep convection, marking its transition to an [[extratropical cyclone]] while located 575&nbsp;miles (925&nbsp;km) south-southwest of [[Cape Race|Cape Race, Newfoundland]].

It was the eighth [[Tropical cyclone naming|named storm]], third hurricane, and second major hurricane \u2013 [[Category 3 hurricane|Category 3]] or higher on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]] \u2013 of the [[2019 Atlantic hurricane season|2019 Atlantic season]]. Humberto formed on September&nbsp;13 from the prolonged interaction of a [[tropical wave]] and an [[Trough (meteorology)|upper-level trough]], then paralleled the eastern coastline of [[Florida]] through September&nbsp;16 before turning sharply northeastward. A generally favorable environment allowed Humberto to become a hurricane that day, and the storm further strengthened to reach peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane on September&nbsp;18. After its center passed within 65&nbsp;[[mile]]s (100&nbsp;[[Kilometre|km]]) of Bermuda around 00:00 [[UTC]] on September 19, the system encountered stronger [[wind shear]] and drier air. Stripped of its deep thunderstorm activity, the system transitioned to a potent [[extratropical cyclone]] early on September&nbsp;20.\n\nForming on the heels of [[Hurricane Dorian]] two weeks prior, Humberto proved far less destructive throughout [[the Bahamas]], producing only some squally weather. The eastern coastline of Florida saw tropical storm-force wind gusts, choppy seas, and light rainfall. [[Rip currents]] killed one person in Florida and another in [[North Carolina]]. In Bermuda, coastal flooding and rainfall were limited by low astronomical [[tide]]s and Humberto's quick forward motion. However, peak surface winds of around 110&nbsp;mph (177&nbsp;km/h), with higher gusts, caused widespread damage to trees, roofs, crops, and power lines, most notably on the western end of the island chain. Some 90% of Bermuda's banana crop was lost. As many as 600 buildings suffered roof damage, while 27,900 customers were left without power; though most of the network was quickly repaired, some electric outages persisted for at least 10 days. [[L.F. Wade International Airport]] and the [[Bermuda Weather Service]] campus both suffered property damage. In total, the hurricane wrought over $25&nbsp;million in damage throughout Bermuda. [[2019 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Jerry|Hurricane Jerry]] to the south briefly posed a threat to the territory as cleanup from Humberto got underway, but it ultimately dissipated with no ill-effects.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{Storm path|Humberto 2019 track.png|alt=Map of the western Atlantic Ocean depicting the track of Hurricane Humberto.}}\nThe origins of Humberto trace back to a [[tropical wave]] that exited the western coast of Africa on August&nbsp;27, 2019. Accompanied by little [[Atmospheric convection|convective activity]], the disturbance moved westward across the Atlantic for several days. On September&nbsp;4, the wave encountered a mid- to upper-level [[Trough (meteorology)|trough of low pressure]] several hundred miles east of the [[Lesser Antilles]]. Resistance from the trough split the wave in two; the southern portion proceeded through the [[Windward Islands]], while the northern portion of the wave moved toward the northwest in tandem with the trough. As the trough became [[Trough (meteorology)#Positively/negatively tilted|negatively tilted]], or oriented northwest-to-southeast, strengthening [[anticyclone|anticyclonic]] flow on its east side promoted periods of enhanced convection close to the tropical wave. These convective bursts, largely driven by [[diurnal cycle]]s, led to the development of a broad surface [[Low-pressure area|low]] on the morning of September&nbsp;12 as the disturbance turned north-northwest through the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]].<ref name=\"TCR\">{{cite report|author=Stacy R.

Some [[Dvorak technique|satellite intensity estimates]] supported Category&nbsp;4 status, and a [[dropsonde]] in the southern eyewall measured winds aloft of 159&nbsp;mph (256&nbsp;km/h), in addition to surface winds of 131&nbsp;mph (211&nbsp;km/h). However, these values were recorded at two-second intervals and, consequently, were not representative of sustained winds. Additionally, [[weather radar]] imagery from Bermuda indicated a quickly eroding eyewall. Therefore, the strongest winds were likely the result of [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] processes producing a wind maximum akin to a [[sting jet]], which would not be indicative of Humberto's true strength as a tropical cyclone.<ref name=\"TCR\"/> As Humberto accelerated ahead of the encroaching upper-level trough to its west, it encountered even stronger upper-level winds and drier air that together triggered a weakening trend.

Saltworks developed first by Native Americans, and the French had settled at the Great Salt Spring on the south side of the [[Saline River (Illinois)|Saline River]], about five miles downstream from [[Equality, Illinois|Equality]]. Beginning in 1803, salt works were also developed at Half Moon Lick, southwest of Equality on the north side of the Saline River. Half Moon Lick is now on private land, but the [[Illinois Salines|Great Salt Springs]] are on public lands in the [[Shawnee National Forest]], about one mile west of the Saline River bridge across [[Illinois Route 1]] on Salt Well Road.<ref>Jon Musgrave. 2004, Rev. ed. 2005.

It then became solidly Democratic for the next century and a third, voting Republican only in the GOP landslides of 1920, 1952, 1972 and 1980. Even in those four elections, no Republican candidate received more than [[Richard Nixon]]\u2019s 53.7 percent in his 3,000-plus-county 1972 triumph.\n\nSince 2000, Gallatin County has followed the same political trajectory as [[United States presidential elections in Tennessee|Tennessee]], [[United States presidential elections in Missouri|Missouri]], [[United States presidential elections in Kentucky|Kentucky]], [[United States presidential elections in West Virginia|West Virginia]] and [[Appalachia]]n regions of adjacent states, whereby the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal views on social issues have produced dramatic swings to the Republican Party amongst its almost entirely Southern white population.<ref>Cohn, Nate; [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/upshot/southern-whites-loyalty-to-gop-nearing-that-of-blacks-to-democrats.html \u2018Demographic Shift: Southern Whites\u2019 Loyalty to G.O.P.
