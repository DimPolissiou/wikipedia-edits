According to the international ranking in the field of medicine Semmelweis University ranked first among the Hungarian universities. The \u201cModern Medical Technologies at Semmelweis University\u201d project ensuring institution's place among the leading research universities in four main areas: [[Personalised medicine]]; Imaging processes and bioimaging: from molecule to the human being; Bio-engineering and [[nanomedicine]]; [[Molecular medicine]].\n\n'''[[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]]''''s research activities encouraged and is present on all levels from the B.Sc. through to the [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral level]]. During the 1980s the BUTE was among the first in the Eastern bloc to recognise the importance of participating in research activities with institutions in [[Western Europe]]. Consequently, the university has the most well-established research relationships with Western European universities. There are many famous [[Alumnus|alumni]] at university: [[Dennis Gabor]] who was the inventor of [[holography]] got his [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1971, [[George Andrew Olah|George Ol\u00e1h]] got his [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1994. Nowadays the university has 110 departments, 1100 lecturers, 400 researchers.\n\n'''[[University of Szeged]]''' internationally acknowledged, competitive research activities are essential parts of its educational mission, and it is particularly important to ensure the institution\u2019s position as a research university. Its research and creative activities include basic and [[applied research]], creative arts, product and service development.\n'''[[University of Debrecen]]''' with a student body of about 30 thousand is one of the largest institutions of higher education in Hungary and its priority areas of research include: [[molecular science]]; physical, computational and material science; medical, health, environmental and [[agricultural science]]; linguistics, culture and bioethics.\n'''[[University of P\u00e9cs]]''' is one of the leading research universities in the country with a huge professional research background. The Szent\u00e1gothai Research Centre of the University of P\u00e9cs is covers all aspects of education, research and innovation in the fields of biomedical, natural and environmental sciences. The infrastructure, instrumentation and expertise of the 22 research groups operating on the premises provide an excellent basis to become a well-known, leading research facility in Hungary as well as in [[Central Europe]] with an extensive and fruitful collaboration network.\n\n'''[[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]''''s research network also contributes significantly to research output of Hungary. It comprises 15 legally independent research institutions and more than 130 research groups at universities co-financed by the academy. This research network focusing above all on discovery research is unparalleled in Hungary, accounting for one-third of all scientific publications produced in the country. Citation indices of publications posted by the academy\u2019s researchers surpass the Hungarian average by 25.5%. The research network addresses discovery and targeted research, in cooperation with universities and corporations. The main components of the network are the [[Biological Research Centre|MTA Szeged Research Centre for Biology]], the [[The Computer and Automation Research Institute, Hungarian Academy of Sciences|MTA Institute for Computer Science and Control]], the [[Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics|MTA R\u00e9nyi Institute of Mathematics]], the [[Chemical Research Center of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences|MTA Research Centre for Natural Sciences]], the [[ATOMKI|MTA Institute of Nuclear Research]], the MTA Institute of Experimental Medicine, MTA Wigner Research Centre for Physics, the MTA Centre for Energy Research and MTA Research Centre for Astronomy and Earth Sciences (involved with Konkoly Observatory).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://mta.hu/english/mtas-research-centres-and-institutes-106085| work=[[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] | title=MTA's Research Centres and Institutes}}</ref>\n\n== Venture capital market ==\nAccording to the HVCA (Hungarian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association) report joint efforts of the [[venture capital]] and [[private equity]] industry and the [[Government of Hungary|Hungarian government]], the access of Hungarian enterprises to venture capital and private equity funding could be significantly increased. During the past two decades these financial intermediaries have also played an increasingly important role in the [[Economy of Hungary|Hungarian economy]]. During this period, venture capital and private equity funds invested close to 4 billion US Dollars into more than 400 [[List of companies of Hungary|Hungarian enterprises]].\n\nHowever, so-called buyout transactions have accounted for about two thirds of the total volume of those investments, which were aimed at the acquisition of shares in mature companies that have been operating profitably for several years. The volume of investments in early and expansive stage companies was significantly lower. Only about 30% of the total volume of investments was directed at companies in the expansive stage and less than 5% at early stage companies. This is also reflected by the fact that over the last two decades slightly more than 10% of the total volume of venture capital and private equity investments came from funds focusing on early stage companies. The remaining close to 90% was invested by private equity funds focusing on more mature companies with greater economic strength. As for the number of transactions, companies in the expansive stage were targeted by the largest number of venture capital and private equity investments: such investments accounted for almost 60% of Hungarian transactions. Nearly a third of transactions involved early stage companies. Buy-out deals represented approximately 10% of transactions by number. Several factors have contributed to this growth. These include [[Taxation in Hungary|tax exemptions on Hungarian venture capital]], funds established in conjunction with large international banks and financial companies and the involvement of major organizations desirous to capitalize on the strengths of Hungarian start up and high-tech companies. In recent years, the share of venture capital invested in the growth stages of enterprises has flourished at the expense of early stage investments.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://cee-startups.com/hungary-2/venture-capital-and-private-equity-industry-in-hungary-extract-of-the-hvca-report-on-the-vc-and-pe-industry-in-hungary/| work=Bal\u00e1zs Szab\u00f3 | title=Venture Capital and Private Equity industry in Hungary}}</ref>\n\n== Nobel Prize laureates ==\n{{Main list|List of Hungarian Nobel laureates}}\nSince the first [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] won a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1905, the country has added a further 12 to its cache.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://mta.hu/english/hungarys-nobel-prize-winners-106018| work=[[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] | title=Hungary's Nobel Prize Winners}}</ref> With scientists, writers and economists all honored in the prestigious awards:\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:0 0 0.5em 1em; text-align:left; font-size:85%;\"\n!

Zsoldos Konkoly Observatory of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences P.O.Box 67, H-1525 Budapest: The first successful spectral equation of black body radiation was the theory of continuous spectra of celestial bodies by Rad\u00f3 von K\u00f6vesligethy (published 1885 in Hungarian, 1890 in German).\n\nK\u00f6vesligethy made several assumptions on the matter-radiation interaction. Based on these assumptions, he derived a spectral equation with the following properties: the spectral distribution of radiation depends only on the temperature, the total irradiated energy is finite (15 years before Planck!), the wavelength of the intensity maximum is inversely proportional to the temperature (eight years before Wien!). Using his spectral equation, he estimated the temperature of several celestial bodies, including the Sun. As a byproduct he developed a theory of the spectroscopic instruments</ref>\nHungary is famous for its excellent [[mathematics education]] which has trained numerous outstanding scientists.

According to the international ranking in the field of medicine Semmelweis University ranked first among the Hungarian universities. The \u201cModern Medical Technologies at Semmelweis University\u201d project ensuring institution's place among the leading research universities in four main areas: [[Personalised medicine]]; Imaging processes and bioimaging: from molecule to the human being; Bio-engineering and [[nanomedicine]]; [[Molecular medicine]].\n\n'''[[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]]''''s research activities encouraged and is present on all levels from the B.Sc. through to the [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral level]]. During the 1980s the BUTE was among the first in the Eastern bloc to recognise the importance of participating in research activities with institutions in [[Western Europe]]. Consequently, the university has the most well-established research relationships with Western European universities. There are many famous [[Alumnus|alumni]] at university: [[Dennis Gabor]] who was the inventor of [[holography]] got his [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1971, [[George Andrew Olah|George Ol\u00e1h]] got his [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1994.

The infrastructure, instrumentation and expertise of the 22 research groups operating on the premises provide an excellent basis to become a well-known, leading research facility in Hungary as well as in [[Central Europe]] with an extensive and fruitful collaboration network.\n\n'''[[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]''''s research network also contributes significantly to research output of Hungary. It comprises 15 legally independent research institutions and more than 130 research groups at universities co-financed by the academy. This research network focusing above all on discovery research is unparalleled in Hungary, accounting for one-third of all scientific publications produced in the country. Citation indices of publications posted by the academy\u2019s researchers surpass the Hungarian average by 25.5%. The research network addresses discovery and targeted research, in cooperation with universities and corporations.

During the past two decades these financial intermediaries have also played an increasingly important role in the [[Economy of Hungary|Hungarian economy]]. During this period, venture capital and private equity funds invested close to 4 billion US Dollars into more than 400 [[List of companies of Hungary|Hungarian enterprises]].\n\nHowever, so-called buyout transactions have accounted for about two thirds of the total volume of those investments, which were aimed at the acquisition of shares in mature companies that have been operating profitably for several years. The volume of investments in early and expansive stage companies was significantly lower. Only about 30% of the total volume of investments was directed at companies in the expansive stage and less than 5% at early stage companies. This is also reflected by the fact that over the last two decades slightly more than 10% of the total volume of venture capital and private equity investments came from funds focusing on early stage companies. The remaining close to 90% was invested by private equity funds focusing on more mature companies with greater economic strength. As for the number of transactions, companies in the expansive stage were targeted by the largest number of venture capital and private equity investments: such investments accounted for almost 60% of Hungarian transactions. Nearly a third of transactions involved early stage companies. Buy-out deals represented approximately 10% of transactions by number. Several factors have contributed to this growth. These include [[Taxation in Hungary|tax exemptions on Hungarian venture capital]], funds established in conjunction with large international banks and financial companies and the involvement of major organizations desirous to capitalize on the strengths of Hungarian start up and high-tech companies. In recent years, the share of venture capital invested in the growth stages of enterprises has flourished at the expense of early stage investments.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://cee-startups.com/hungary-2/venture-capital-and-private-equity-industry-in-hungary-extract-of-the-hvca-report-on-the-vc-and-pe-industry-in-hungary/| work=Bal\u00e1zs Szab\u00f3 | title=Venture Capital and Private Equity industry in Hungary}}</ref>\n\n== Nobel Prize laureates ==\n{{Main list|List of Hungarian Nobel laureates}}\nSince the first [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] won a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1905, the country has added a further 12 to its cache.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://mta.hu/english/hungarys-nobel-prize-winners-106018| work=[[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] | title=Hungary's Nobel Prize Winners}}</ref> With scientists, writers and economists all honored in the prestigious awards:\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:0 0 0.5em 1em; text-align:left; font-size:85%;\"\n!

Based on these assumptions, he derived a spectral equation with the following properties: the spectral distribution of radiation depends only on the temperature, the total irradiated energy is finite (15 years before Planck!), the wavelength of the intensity maximum is inversely proportional to the temperature (eight years before Wien!). Using his spectral equation, he estimated the temperature of several celestial bodies, including the Sun. As a byproduct he developed a theory of the spectroscopic instruments</ref>\nHungary is famous for its excellent [[mathematics education]] which has trained numerous outstanding scientists.

Around this time, Hawks bassist Rebel Paine was fired by Hawkins, who, wasting no time, ordered Danko to learn to play the bass, with help from other members of the band. By September 1960, he was Hawkins's bassist.\n\nIn 1961, Danko with drummer [[Levon Helm]] backed guitarist [[Lenny Breau]] on several tracks recorded at Hallmark Studios in Toronto.

Grossman introduced the band's music to Dylan, who was impressed. The group was performing at Tony Mart's, a popular club in Somers Point, New Jersey, and Grossman's office called the club to speak with Levon and the group about touring with Dylan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tonymart.com/memory-lane-1965.htm|title=Memory Lane 1965 Tony Marts Somers Point NJ|work=tonymart.com|accessdate=February 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nHelm was not happy to be backing a \"strummer\" but reluctantly agreed, and the band became Dylan's backup group for a tour beginning in September. The tour, however, became too much for Helm, who departed in November. Through May 1966, Dylan and the remaining foursome (together with pick-up drummers, including the actor and musician [[Mickey Jones]]) traveled across America, Australia, and Europe. After the final shows in England, Dylan retreated to his new home in [[Woodstock (town), New York|Woodstock, New York]], and the Hawks joined him there shortly thereafter.<ref name=Sounes221>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=221}}</ref>\n\n===The Band (1968\u20131977)===\n{{main|The Band}}\n[[File:The Band 2005710011.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Danko performing with the Band in Hamburg, 1971]]\nIt was Danko who found the pink house on Parnassus Lane in [[Saugerties, New York]], which became known as Big Pink. Danko, Hudson, and Manuel moved in, and Robertson lived nearby. The Band's musical sessions with Dylan took place in the basement of Big Pink, between June and October 1967, generating recordings that were officially released in 1975 as ''[[The Basement Tapes]]''.

When they married, Danko was still in a neck brace.<ref>Grace Seldner interview with Carol Caffin, 2007</ref> Rick and Grace divorced in October 1980.<ref>California Divorce Index 1966-1984, (October 16, 1980)</ref>\n\nThe Band finally made their concert debut at [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s [[Winterland Ballroom]] in San Francisco in April 1969.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} By this time, they were already hard at work on their [[The Band (album)|eponymous second album]]. On that record, sometimes known as the Brown Album, Danko sang what would become two of his signature songs\u2014and two of the group's best-loved classics: \"[[When You Awake]]\" and \"Unfaithful Servant.\" Both songs exemplified Danko's talents as a lead singer and demonstrated his naturally plaintive voice.\n\nDanko is featured in the documentary film ''[[Festival Express]]'', about an all-star tour by train across Canada in 1970. On the train, he sings an impromptu version of \"Ain't No More Cane\" with [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Janis Joplin]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Alex Nesic|title=Rick Danko, Janis, Marmaduke, Jerry and Bobby - Ain't No More Cane (Live 1970)|date=2014-01-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVDDD9bScPk|accessdate=2017-02-02}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The Band's sound was defined by each member\u2014Robertson's lyrics and guitar work, Helm's \"bayou folk\" drumming and Southern voice, Manuel's [[Ray Charles]]\u2013like vocals and complex keyboard rhythms, Hudson's arrangements on an assortment of instruments and Danko's distinctive tenor voice, his on-top-of-the-melody harmonies, and his percussive, melodic bass-playing style were an integral part of the group's sound.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn an interview published in ''[[Guitar Player]]'', Danko cited bassists [[James Jamerson]], [[Ron Carter]], [[Edgar Willis (musician)|Edgar Willis]], and [[Chuck Rainey]] as his musical influences.

Issued in 1977, his [[Rick Danko (album)|self-titled d\u00e9but]] featured each of his former bandmates in addition to [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Doug Sahm]], [[Blondie Chaplin]], and Danko's brother, [[Terry Danko|Terry]]. The album was primarily recorded at the Band's California studio, Shangri-La. The poor sales of the album destined it for rarity status. After he recorded an unreleased follow-up album, Danko was dropped from Arista. The follow-up album was finally released as a part of ''[[Cryin' Heart Blues]]'' in 2005.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n[[Image:Butterfield & Danko 1979.jpg|left|thumb|Danko with [[Paul Butterfield]] Woodstock Reunion, 1979]]\nIn early 1979 Danko opened shows for [[Boz Scaggs]]. Also in 1979, Danko and [[Paul Butterfield]] toured together as the Danko/Butterfield Band. Among the songs they covered was \"[[Sail On, Sailor]]\", originally recorded by [[the Beach Boys]], with Blondie Chaplin, who toured with Danko/Butterfield, on guitar and vocals. From 1983-99, Danko alternated between a reformed version of [[the Band]] featuring Helm, Hudson, and guitarist [[Jim Weider]] (and, from 1983 to 1986, Manuel); a solo career; and collaborations including award-winning work with singer-songwriter [[Eric Andersen]] and Norway's [[Jonas Fjeld]] as [[Danko/Fjeld/Andersen]].<ref name=\"theguardian\">[https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/17/guardianobituaries.adamsweeting \"News \u2013 Obituaries \u2013 Rick Danko\"], ''The Guardian'', December 17, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn 1984, Danko joined members of the Byrds, the [[Flying Burrito Brothers]] and others in a touring company called \"The Byrds Twenty-Year Celebration.\" Several members of this band performed solo songs to start the show including Danko, who performed \"Mystery Train\". In 1989, he toured with [[Levon Helm]] and [[Garth Hudson]] as part of [[Ringo Starr]]'s first [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]]. Danko sang on the [[Pink Floyd]] songs \"[[Comfortably Numb]]\" and \"[[Mother (Pink Floyd song)|Mother]]\", the former with [[Van Morrison]], [[Roger Waters]], and [[Levon Helm]], and the latter with Helm and [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] on July 21, 1990, in [[Roger Waters]]'s stage production of ''[[The Wall Concert in Berlin]]''. He recorded demos and made a number of appearances on albums by other artists throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and, in 1997, released ''[[Rick Danko in Concert]]''. Two years later, a third solo album (''[[Live on Breeze Hill]]'') was released, and Danko was at work on a fourth (''[[Times Like These (Rick Danko album)|Times Like These]]'') at the time of his death.\n\nIn the meantime, [[the Band]] (without Robbie Robertson and Richard Manuel) recorded three more albums, and Danko teamed with Fjeld and Andersen for two trio albums, ''[[Danko/Fjeld/Andersen (album)|Danko/Fjeld/Andersen]]'' in 1991 and ''[[Ridin' on the Blinds]]'' in 1994. By this time, Danko had gained a lot of weight, and his addiction to alcohol and drugs had intensified.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 1996, Danko was found guilty of receiving a package of heroin mailed to him in Japan. He told the presiding judge that he had begun using the drug (together with prescription morphine) to fight lifelong pain resulting from his 1968 auto accident. He received a two-and-a-half-year suspended sentence.<ref>{{cite news|author=Neil Strauss|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/12/nyregion/rick-danko-56-a-groundbreaker-with-the-band-dies.html|title=Rick Danko, 56, a Groundbreaker With the Band, Dies|publisher=Nytimes.com|date=December 12, 1999|accessdate=2014-07-14}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Danko was inducted into the [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of The Band.<ref name=rockhall />\n\n===Death===\n[[Image:RickDankoGrave2015.JPG|thumb|right|Danko's grave at the Woodstock Cemetery, April 19, 2015 (the birth year is incorrect)]]\nOn December 10, 1999, days after the end of a brief tour of the Midwest that included two shows in the Chicago area and a final gig at the [[Ark (folk venue)|Ark]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], Danko died in his sleep at his home in [[Marbletown, New York]].

In late 1969, the Band was given some equipment by [[Ampeg]], which included a fretted Ampeg AEB, a fretless Ampeg AMUB and an Ampeg \"Baby Bass\", a fiberglass-made electric upright bass. The fretless AMUB, modified with jazz pickups, was his bass of choice for the next years to come, and can be heard prominently on ''[[Stage Fright (album)|Stage Fright]]'' and ''[[Cahoots (album)|Cahoots]]'', and was used live, as can be seen in the film [[Festival Express]] also in video footage included in the ''Live at the Academy of Music 1971'' release.

According to Rick's eldest brother, Maurice, Rick was born at home, and his parents did not file for a birth certificate right away. When they did get the certificate, it had the wrong year, 1942. The family never got around to changing it, and young Rick used this earlier date to his benefit: It meant that he could get a driver's licence earlier, get into bars at a younger age, etc. Since the birth certificate was never changed, Rick's driver's licence also contained the same date. And since those two official IDs contained the erroneous year, his headstone was marked with the same date, since there was no other official confirmation of the real date. Another brother, Terry, also confirmed that Rick was born in 1943.{{cite web|url=http://sipthewine.blogspot.com/2008/07/ricks-real-birthdate-not-exactly-hard.html|title=Rick Danko: Rick's Real Birthdate: The Hardest Proof ...|website=Sipthewine.blogspot.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/TerryDankoBandBite1vol2.html|title=Carol Caffin: A Chat with Terry Danko|work=hiof.no|accessdate=February 15, 2016}}</ref> in [[Blayney, Ontario]], a farming community outside the town of [[Simcoe, Ontario|Simcoe]], the third of four sons in a musical family of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] descent.

Around this time, Hawks bassist Rebel Paine was fired by Hawkins, who, wasting no time, ordered Danko to learn to play the bass, with help from other members of the band. By September 1960, he was Hawkins's bassist, using a [[Fender VI]] six-string bass, then switching to a [[Fender Jazz Bass]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nIn 1961, Danko with drummer [[Levon Helm]] backed guitarist [[Lenny Breau]] on several tracks recorded at Hallmark Studios in Toronto.

An altercation that year between Danko and Hawkins led Danko, [[Levon Helm]], [[Robbie Robertson]], Manuel, and Hudson to give two-weeks' notice in early 1964, and they parted ways with Hawkins on reasonably amicable terms.<ref name=\"carnival\">[http://theband.hiof.no/history/part_0.html ''Life Is A Carnival''].

Playing a circuit that stretched in an arc from [[Ontario]] to [[Arkansas]], they became known as \"the best damn bar band in the land.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nBy 1965, with two singles under their belt, recorded as the Canadian Squires, they met the legendary blues harmonicist and vocalist [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]] and planned a collaboration with him as soon as he returned to Chicago. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The group went on to play a four-month stand of gigs in [[New Jersey]] immediately afterward, but Williamson died two months after their meeting, and the collaboration never happened.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn August 1965, Mary Martin, an assistant to [[Bob Dylan]]'s manager Albert Grossman, heard the music of the group, then known as Levon and the Hawks. Grossman introduced the band's music to Dylan, who was impressed. The group was performing at Tony Mart's, a popular club in Somers Point, New Jersey, and Grossman's office called the club to speak with Levon and the group about touring with Dylan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tonymart.com/memory-lane-1965.htm|title=Memory Lane 1965 Tony Marts Somers Point NJ|work=tonymart.com|accessdate=February 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nHelm was not happy to be backing a \"strummer\" but reluctantly agreed, and the band became Dylan's backup group for a tour beginning in September. The tour, however, became too much for Helm, who departed in November. Through May 1966, Dylan and the remaining foursome (together with pick-up drummers, including the actor and musician [[Mickey Jones]]) traveled across America, Australia, and Europe. After the final shows in England, Dylan retreated to his new home in [[Woodstock (town), New York|Woodstock, New York]], and the Hawks joined him there shortly thereafter.<ref name=Sounes221>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=221}}</ref>\n\n===The Band (1968\u20131977)===\n{{main|The Band}}\n[[File:The Band 2005710011.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Danko performing with the Band in Hamburg, 1971]]\nIt was Danko who found the pink house on Parnassus Lane in [[Saugerties, New York]], which became known as Big Pink. Danko, Hudson, and Manuel moved in, and Robertson lived nearby. The Band's musical sessions with Dylan took place in the basement of Big Pink, between June and October 1967, generating recordings that were officially released in 1975 as ''[[The Basement Tapes]]''. In October, the Hawks began demo recordings for their first album, with Helm rejoining the group in that month. Their manager, [[Albert Grossman]], secured them a recording deal with [[Capitol Records]] in late 1967.<ref>{{harvnb|Hoskyns|1993|p=143}}</ref>\n\nFrom January to March 1968, the Band recorded their debut album, ''[[Music From Big Pink|Music from Big Pink]]'', in recording studios in New York and Los Angeles.<ref name=\"HoskynsLiner\">{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/hoskyns_ln_remasters.html|title=Liner Notes for The Band 2000 remasters|author=Hoskyns, Barney|accessdate=2010-08-04|publisher=theband.hiof}}</ref> On this album, Danko sang lead vocal on three songs: \"Caledonia Mission\", \"[[Long Black Veil]]\" and \"[[This Wheel's on Fire]].\"\n\nBefore the Band could promote the album by touring, Danko was severely injured in a car accident, breaking his neck and back in six places, which put him in traction for months. While he was in traction, Danko's girlfriend, Grace Seldner, informed him that she was pregnant, and he proposed from his hospital bed. When they married, Danko was still in a neck brace.<ref>Grace Seldner interview with Carol Caffin, 2007</ref> Rick and Grace divorced in October 1980.<ref>California Divorce Index 1966-1984, (October 16, 1980)</ref>\n\nThe Band finally made their concert debut at [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]'s [[Winterland Ballroom]] in San Francisco in April 1969.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} By this time, they were already hard at work on their [[The Band (album)|eponymous second album]]. On that record, sometimes known as the Brown Album, Danko sang what would become two of his signature songs\u2014and two of the group's best-loved classics: \"[[When You Awake]]\" and \"Unfaithful Servant.\" Both songs exemplified Danko's talents as a lead singer and demonstrated his naturally plaintive voice.\n\nDanko is featured in the documentary film ''[[Festival Express]]'', about an all-star tour by train across Canada in 1970. On the train, he sings an impromptu version of \"Ain't No More Cane\" with [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Janis Joplin]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Alex Nesic|title=Rick Danko, Janis, Marmaduke, Jerry and Bobby - Ain't No More Cane (Live 1970)|date=2014-01-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVDDD9bScPk|accessdate=2017-02-02}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The Band's sound was defined by each member\u2014Robertson's lyrics and guitar work, Helm's \"bayou folk\" drumming and Southern voice, Manuel's [[Ray Charles]]\u2013like vocals and complex keyboard rhythms, Hudson's arrangements on an assortment of instruments and Danko's distinctive tenor voice, his on-top-of-the-melody harmonies, and his percussive, melodic bass-playing style were an integral part of the group's sound.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn an interview published in ''[[Guitar Player]]'', Danko cited bassists [[James Jamerson]], [[Ron Carter]], [[Edgar Willis (musician)|Edgar Willis]], and [[Chuck Rainey]] as his musical influences.

Issued in 1977, his [[Rick Danko (album)|self-titled d\u00e9but]] featured each of his former bandmates in addition to [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Doug Sahm]], [[Blondie Chaplin]], and Danko's brother, [[Terry Danko|Terry]]. The album was primarily recorded at the Band's California studio, Shangri-La. The poor sales of the album destined it for rarity status. After he recorded an unreleased follow-up album, Danko was dropped from Arista. The follow-up album was finally released as a part of ''[[Cryin' Heart Blues]]'' in 2005.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n[[Image:Butterfield & Danko 1979.jpg|left|thumb|Danko with [[Paul Butterfield]] Woodstock Reunion, 1979]]\nIn early 1979 Danko opened shows for [[Boz Scaggs]]. Also in 1979, Danko and [[Paul Butterfield]] toured together as the Danko/Butterfield Band. Among the songs they covered was \"[[Sail On, Sailor]]\", originally recorded by [[the Beach Boys]], with Blondie Chaplin, who toured with Danko/Butterfield, on guitar and vocals. From 1983-99, Danko alternated between a reformed version of [[the Band]] featuring Helm, Hudson, and guitarist [[Jim Weider]] (and, from 1983 to 1986, Manuel); a solo career; and collaborations including award-winning work with singer-songwriter [[Eric Andersen]] and Norway's [[Jonas Fjeld]] as [[Danko/Fjeld/Andersen]].<ref name=\"theguardian\">[https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/dec/17/guardianobituaries.adamsweeting \"News \u2013 Obituaries \u2013 Rick Danko\"], ''The Guardian'', December 17, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn 1984, Danko joined members of the Byrds, the [[Flying Burrito Brothers]] and others in a touring company called \"The Byrds Twenty-Year Celebration.\" Several members of this band performed solo songs to start the show including Danko, who performed \"Mystery Train\". In 1989, he toured with [[Levon Helm]] and [[Garth Hudson]] as part of [[Ringo Starr]]'s first [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]]. Danko sang on the [[Pink Floyd]] songs \"[[Comfortably Numb]]\" and \"[[Mother (Pink Floyd song)|Mother]]\", the former with [[Van Morrison]], [[Roger Waters]], and [[Levon Helm]], and the latter with Helm and [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] on July 21, 1990, in [[Roger Waters]]'s stage production of ''[[The Wall Concert in Berlin]]''. He recorded demos and made a number of appearances on albums by other artists throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and, in 1997, released ''[[Rick Danko in Concert]]''. Two years later, a third solo album (''[[Live on Breeze Hill]]'') was released, and Danko was at work on a fourth (''[[Times Like These (Rick Danko album)|Times Like These]]'') at the time of his death.\n\nIn the meantime, [[the Band]] (without Robbie Robertson and Richard Manuel) recorded three more albums, and Danko teamed with Fjeld and Andersen for two trio albums, ''[[Danko/Fjeld/Andersen (album)|Danko/Fjeld/Andersen]]'' in 1991 and ''[[Ridin' on the Blinds]]'' in 1994. By this time, Danko had gained a lot of weight, and his addiction to alcohol and drugs had intensified.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 1996, Danko was found guilty of receiving a package of heroin mailed to him in Japan. He told the presiding judge that he had begun using the drug (together with prescription morphine) to fight lifelong pain resulting from his 1968 auto accident.

In late 1969, the Band was given some equipment by [[Ampeg]], which included a fretted Ampeg AEB, a fretless Ampeg AMUB and an Ampeg \"Baby Bass\", a fiberglass-made electric upright bass. The fretless AMUB, modified with jazz pickups, was his bass of choice for the next years to come, and can be heard prominently on ''[[Stage Fright (album)|Stage Fright]]'' and ''[[Cahoots (album)|Cahoots]]'', and was used live, as can be seen in the film [[Festival Express]] also in video footage included in the ''Live at the Academy of Music 1971'' release.

The teams are members of the [[American Athletic Conference]] (The American), which from 1979 to 2013 was known as the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]]. Cincinnati and Wichita State University are currently the only members of The American that are located in the [[Midwestern United States]]; all other members are in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] or [[Southern United States|South]].\n\nThe Bearcats were previously members of [[Conference USA]], where they were a founding member. The creation of Conference USA was the result of a merger between the [[Great Midwest Conference]] (of which Cincinnati was a member) and the [[Metro Conference]] (whom Cincinnati had previously been a member) in 1995. Other collegiate athletic conferences which the school has belonged to includes the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], 1957\u20131969; the [[Mid-American Conference]], 1947\u20131952; the [[Buckeye Athletic Association]], 1925\u20131935, and the [[Ohio Athletic Conference]], 1910\u20131924.\n\n==The Bearcat==\n[[File:Cincinnati Bearcat.png|thumb|left|Current version of the Bearcat.]]\nThe Bearcat became the UC mascot on October 31, 1914 in a football game against the UK Wildcats. The key players in the birth of the Bearcat were a star UC player named Baehr, a creative cheerleader, and a talented cartoonist. During the second half of that hard-fought football game, UC cheerleader Norman \"Pat\" Lyon, building on the efforts of fullback Leonard K. \"Teddy\" Baehr, created the chant: \"They may be Wildcats, but we have a Baehr-cat on our side.\"\nThe crowd took up the cry: \"Come on, Baehr-cat!\" Cincinnati prevailed, 14\u20137, and the victory was memorialized in a cartoon published on the front page of the student newspaper, the weekly University News, on November 3. The cartoon, by John \"Paddy\" Reece, depicted a bedraggled Kentucky Wildcat being chased by a creature labeled \"Cincinnati Bear Cat\".\n\nThe name stuck, but not immediately. Following Teddy Baehr's graduation in 1916, the name dropped out of use, at least in print, for a few years. On November 15, 1919, Cincinnati played at Tennessee. ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' writer [[Frederick Bushnell \"Jack\" Ryder|Jack Ryder]]'s dispatch on the game was the first time that the major media called UC's teams \"Bearcats.\" From then on, the university's teams were regularly called Bearcats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uc.edu/about/history.html |title=History of the Bearcat, University of Cincinnati |publisher=Uc.edu |accessdate=2015-10-22}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 the Cincinnati Zoo adopted a three-month-old [[binturong]] or \"bearcat\". The zoo had a public naming contest where they decided on the name \"Lucy.\"  Lucy was a prominent figure at the University of Cincinnati often to be found on Sheakley Lawn before home football games.  On August 30th 2019, it was announced that \"Lucy\", the Cincinnati Zoo's binturong (Bearcat) would be retiring from her duties as Mascot. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wlwt.com/article/lucy-the-bearcat-ucs-live-mascot-is-retiring/28861207 |title=Lucy the bearcat, UC's live mascot, is retiring  |publisher=wlwt.com}}</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Varsity sports==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Cincinnati Bearcats|Men's sports|Women's sports}}\n|-\n| [[Cincinnati Bearcats baseball|Baseball]] || [[Cincinnati Bearcats women's basketball|Basketball]]\n|-\n| [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Basketball]] || Cross country\n|-\n| Cross country || Golf\n|-\n| [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Football]] || Lacrosse\n|-\n| Golf || Soccer\n|-\n| Swimming & diving || Swimming & diving\n|-\n| Track and field<sup>\u2020</sup> || Tennis\n|-\n| || Track and field<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|-\n| || Volleyball\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"{{NCAA secondary color cell|Cincinnati Bearcats}}\" | {{small|\u2020 \u2013 Track and field includes both indoor and outdoor.}}\n|}\nThe University of Cincinnati sponsors teams in seven men's and nine women's [[NCAA]] sanctioned sports, competing in the American Athletic Conference.\n\n===Men's basketball===\n{{main article|Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball}}\n[[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati's men's basketball]] squads have been a perennial bracket team in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]]. A prolific era in [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Bearcats basketball]] was during the late 1950s and early 1960s, when the Bearcats posted five consecutive [[Final Four]] appearances. Unanimous three-time All American guard [[Oscar Robertson]] led the nation in scoring during the 1957\u201358, 1958\u201359, and 1959\u201360 seasons and posted a career average of 33.8 points per game, which ranks as the third all-time best in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]].\n\nCincinnati has won two [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|national championships]] in 1961 and 1962. The 1961 and 1962 titles were won under rookie coach [[Ed Jucker]].\n\nCincinnati fell out of prominence during the early 1970s. After a brief resurgence in the mid-1970s, the program fell on hard times in the 1980s, but was revitalized under head coach [[Bob Huggins]] following his hiring in 1989. Under Huggins, the Bearcats compiled a 399\u2013127 record in sixteen seasons, and posted fourteen straight NCAA tournament appearances. The most notable of the teams from the Huggins era was the 1991\u20131992 team, which lost to the [[University of Michigan|Michigan Wolverines]] in the [[Final Four]]. In addition, Huggins was responsible for recruiting several future [[NBA]] players including [[Kenyon Martin]], [[Corie Blount]], [[Ruben Patterson]], [[Nick Van Exel]] and [[DerMarr Johnson]].\n\n'''Postseason tournaments'''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;

The Tennis Club competes in the USTA Tennis on Campus and the Great Lakes Tennis Conference. The Waterski Team were 2008 DII National Champions. The University of Cincinnati Rugby Football Club was established in 1971 and competes in Division 1 [[college rugby]] in the MAC conference. The University of Cincinnati Women's Rugby Football Club was founded in 2012 and competes in Division 2 in the Ohio Valley Conference. In 2014 and 2015 UCWRFC competed in the Women's College Division 2 Fall Championship; advancing to the round of 8 in 2015.\n\nClub sports at Cincinnati operate in a tier system. The top tier are the Tier 5 sports, which are classified as semi-varsity. These clubs operate at a level similar to a varsity team in sports for which Cincinnati lacks varsity representation, and the tier reflects the commitment these students dedicate to their club. The three Tier 5 semi-varsity sports as of 2013 are equestrian, men's ice hockey, and men's and women's rowing.<ref>University of Cincinnati, Club Sports Handbook, http://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/sald/docs/CSB%20Documents/Club_Sports_Handbook_2012_13.pdf</ref>\n\n==Championships==\n\n===NCAA team championships===\n\nCincinnati has won 2 NCAA team national championships.<ref>http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/champs_records_book/Overall.pdf</ref>\n\n*'''Men's (2)'''\n**[[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship#Team titles|Basketball]] (2): 1961, 1962, 2020\n*see also:\n**[[American Athletic Conference#NCAA team championships|American Athletic Conference NCAA team championships]]\n**[[List of NCAA schools with the most NCAA Division I championships#NCAA Division I Team Championships|List of NCAA schools with the most NCAA Division I championships]]\n\n===Other national team championships===\nBelow are 5 national team titles that were not bestowed by the NCAA:\n\n*Women's\n**Dance (5): 2004, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2015\n\nThe Bearcats won the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] in 1961 and 1962, both times against [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]].

As of 2009, there are no nails in the Keg of Nails, nor does anyone know if there ever were any in the first place.\n\nWhen Cincinnati joined the Big East in 2005, they and the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|University of Pittsburgh]] started the [[River City Rivalry]]. The game is a battle for the River City Rivalry trophy. In 2013 the rivalry series ended due to Pittsburgh's exit from the Big East to the Atlantic Coast Conference. \n\nIn [[college basketball|basketball]], the Bearcats' crosstown rival is the [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier University]] Musketeers. Xavier is located less than 3 miles from the University of Cincinnati's main campus. The Bearcats and the Musketeers meet annually in the popular [[Skyline Chili]] [[Crosstown Shootout]]. The Bearcats also have basketball rivalries with the [[Temple Owls men's basketball|Temple Owls]], and [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis Tigers]].\n\nCincinnati also has an intermittent rivalry with [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State University]], [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville Cardinals]] and the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|University of Kentucky]]. Although Cincinnati does not play these schools regularly, these are geographic rivals. Other than Xavier, they are geographically the closest universities of similar size and/or stature. In 1961 and 1962 Cincinnati defeated Ohio State in both of its back-to-back national title games in basketball.\n\n==Athletic facilities==\n[[File:UCchargedownthesteps.JPG|right|thumb|The UC Bearcat Band charges down Nippert Stadium's steps.]]\nAll of the athletic facilities (with the exception of Fifth Third Arena and Marge Schott Stadium) are open 24/7 for student use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/facilities/cinn-facilities.html |title=University of Cincinnati Official Athletic Site |publisher=Gobearcats.com |accessdate=January 17, 2011}}</ref>\n*Richard E.

The teams are members of the [[American Athletic Conference]] (The American), which from 1979 to 2013 was known as the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]]. Cincinnati and Wichita State University are currently the only members of The American that are located in the [[Midwestern United States]]; all other members are in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] or [[Southern United States|South]].\n\nThe Bearcats were previously members of [[Conference USA]], where they were a founding member. The creation of Conference USA was the result of a merger between the [[Great Midwest Conference]] (of which Cincinnati was a member) and the [[Metro Conference]] (whom Cincinnati had previously been a member) in 1995. Other collegiate athletic conferences which the school has belonged to includes the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], 1957\u20131969; the [[Mid-American Conference]], 1947\u20131952; the [[Buckeye Athletic Association]], 1925\u20131935, and the [[Ohio Athletic Conference]], 1910\u20131924.\n\n==The Bearcat==\n[[File:Cincinnati Bearcat.png|thumb|left|Current version of the Bearcat.]]\nThe Bearcat became the UC mascot on October 31, 1914 in a football game against the UK Wildcats. The key players in the birth of the Bearcat were a star UC player named Baehr, a creative cheerleader, and a talented cartoonist. During the second half of that hard-fought football game, UC cheerleader Norman \"Pat\" Lyon, building on the efforts of fullback Leonard K. \"Teddy\" Baehr, created the chant: \"They may be Wildcats, but we have a Baehr-cat on our side.\"\nThe crowd took up the cry: \"Come on, Baehr-cat!\" Cincinnati prevailed, 14\u20137, and the victory was memorialized in a cartoon published on the front page of the student newspaper, the weekly University News, on November 3. The cartoon, by John \"Paddy\" Reece, depicted a bedraggled Kentucky Wildcat being chased by a creature labeled \"Cincinnati Bear Cat\".\n\nThe name stuck, but not immediately. Following Teddy Baehr's graduation in 1916, the name dropped out of use, at least in print, for a few years. On November 15, 1919, Cincinnati played at Tennessee.

A prolific era in [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Bearcats basketball]] was during the late 1950s and early 1960s, when the Bearcats posted five consecutive [[Final Four]] appearances. Unanimous three-time All American guard [[Oscar Robertson]] led the nation in scoring during the 1957\u201358, 1958\u201359, and 1959\u201360 seasons and posted a career average of 33.8 points per game, which ranks as the third all-time best in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]].\n\nCincinnati has won two [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|national championships]] in 1961 and 1962. The 1961 and 1962 titles were won under rookie coach [[Ed Jucker]].\n\nCincinnati fell out of prominence during the early 1970s. After a brief resurgence in the mid-1970s, the program fell on hard times in the 1980s, but was revitalized under head coach [[Bob Huggins]] following his hiring in 1989. Under Huggins, the Bearcats compiled a 399\u2013127 record in sixteen seasons, and posted fourteen straight NCAA tournament appearances. The most notable of the teams from the Huggins era was the 1991\u20131992 team, which lost to the [[University of Michigan|Michigan Wolverines]] in the [[Final Four]]. In addition, Huggins was responsible for recruiting several future [[NBA]] players including [[Kenyon Martin]], [[Corie Blount]], [[Ruben Patterson]], [[Nick Van Exel]] and [[DerMarr Johnson]].\n\n'''Postseason tournaments'''\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;

The top tier are the Tier 5 sports, which are classified as semi-varsity. These clubs operate at a level similar to a varsity team in sports for which Cincinnati lacks varsity representation, and the tier reflects the commitment these students dedicate to their club.
