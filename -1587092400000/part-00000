A follower of educational reformer [[John Dewey]], French put in place many of the [[progressive education]]al underpinnings that still guide the school, such as a focus on the whole student, [[experiential learning]], community involvement, and a low student-to-faculty ratio. In 1939, the school implemented a form of community self-governance modeled after the traditional [[New England]] [[town meeting]]. Following [[Robert's Rules of Order]], the entire school community, including students, meet to propose and debate school rules and policies, elect representatives to school committees, and decide on other relevant topics to the community. The Cambridge School Town Meeting continues to be a central part of the school's [[community governance]] to the present day.\n\n== Academics ==\nThe school has gained recognition as a pioneer of the [[Modular scheduling|Module System]], implemented in 1973 by then Head of School Bob Sandoe.\n\nThe goal of the Module, or \"Mod\" System, is to provide a framework to allow students to focus on fewer subjects more intensively during a given term. The academic year is divided into six terms (known as modules) of six weeks apiece. A school day consists of four class blocks of 90 minutes each, with some classes spanning several consecutive blocks. Students take up to three academic and one extracurricular class per mod. Some classes, such as those in mathematics or a foreign language, continue for multiple mods. No two students have the same schedule; every student's schedule is unique to themselves. Students submit what classes they would like to enroll in, and the faculty works on their schedule to fit their electives into their schedule, along with the required classes each class must participate in.\n\n== Tuition ==\nThe Cambridge School of Weston's tuition for the 2019-2020 school year is $63,000 for boarding and $50,900 for day students.<ref>https://www.csw.org/admissions/tuition-and-financial-aid/tuition-and-fees</ref> About 25% of students receive financial aid.<ref>https://www.csw.org/admissions/tuition-and-financial-aid/faqs</ref>\n\n==Initiatives==\nThe Cambridge School of Weston finished building a Green building called the Garthwaite Center for Science and Art, with a dedication ceremony and day of environmental education events on October 20, 2007. \n\n== Athletics ==\n\nThe Cambridge School of Weston offers the following interscholastic sports:<ref>https://www.csw.org/athletics/interscholastic-sports</ref>\n* [[Association football|Soccer]]\n* [[Cross country running]]\n* [[Field hockey]]\n* [[Basketball]]\n* [[Baseball]]\n* [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]]\n* [[Volleyball]]\n* [[Tennis]]\n* Girls' [[lacrosse]]\n\nAdditional fitness courses offered include:<ref>https://www.csw.org/athletics/recreation-and-wellness-activities</ref>\n\n* [[Yoga]]\n* [[Rock climbing]]\n* [[Fencing]]\n* [[Bicycling]]\n* [[Weight training]] \n* [[Golf]] \n* [[Table tennis]]\n* [[Dance]] \n* [[Martial arts]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Squirrel Flower|Ella Williams]], singer-songwriter and lead of [[Squirrel Flower]]\n* [[Wet (band)|Kelly Zutrau]], singer-songwriter and lead of [[Wet (band)]]\n* [[Miguel Arteta]], director\n*[[Hilaria Baldwin]]\n* [[Louisa Bertman]], illustrator\n* [[Josh Clayton-Felt]], singer-songwriter\n* [[Andras Jones]], actor, singer-songwriter\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]], actress\n* [[Robert M.

series written by [[Nisio Isin]] and illustrated by Vofan. The plot of the series centers around Koyomi Araragi, a third-year high school student who survives a vampire attack and subsequently finds himself helping girls involved with a variety of apparitions, deities, ghosts, beasts, spirits, and other supernatural phenomena. Between November 2006 and April 2019, [[Kodansha]] published 25 volumes in the series under its [[Kodansha Box]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], with plans for at least three more volumes {{as of|2017|July|lc=y}}. Each of the series' 18 story arcs share the common title suffix {{Nihongo|''-monogatari''|\u7269\u8a9e}}.\n\n[[Shaft (company)|Shaft]] has animated the ''Monogatari'' series multiple times since 2009. The first season of the [[anime]] adaptation consists of 30 episodes, which were broadcast in Japan between July 2009 and December 2012. The second season consists of 28 episodes broadcast between July and December 2013, and the third and final season consists of 42 episodes broadcast between December 2014 and June 2019. A prequel anime film trilogy, ''[[Kizumonogatari (film series)|Kizumonogatari]]'', was released in 2016 and 2017. A [[manga]] series illustrated by [[Oh! great]] adapting the series' first arc, ''Bakemonogatari'', began serialization in Kodansha's ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' in March 2018.\n\n==Plot and setting==\n{{see also|List of Monogatari characters}}\nThe ''Monogatari'' series revolves around Koyomi Araragi, a third-year high school student who has almost restored his humanity after briefly becoming a vampire during spring break. One day, a classmate of his, the reclusive Hitagi Senj\u014dgahara, falls down a flight of stairs at school into Koyomi's arms. To his surprise, he discovers that Hitagi weighs almost nothing, in defiance of physics. Despite being threatened to keep away, Koyomi offers his help and introduces her to Meme Oshino, a strange middle-aged man living in an abandoned [[cram school]] who helped reverse his vampirism. Once Koyomi helps solve Hitagi's problem, she decides to become his girlfriend.\n\nAs the series progresses, Koyomi finds himself involved with other girls afflicted by {{Nihongo|\"oddities\"|\u602a\u7570|kaii|{{lit}} \"strangeness\"}}: the ghost of a child named Mayoi Hachikuji; his underclassman Suruga Kanbaru; Nadeko Sengoku, a friend of his sisters; his classmate Tsubasa Hanekawa; and his own younger sisters Karen and Tsukihi. To deal with the apparitions, which feed on human emotions and often take forms symbolically represented by animals, Koyomi relies on supernatural guidance from Oshino and, later, from Shinobu, the once-powerful blonde vampire who attacked him and later assumed the appearance of an eight-year-old girl.\n\nMost heroines have an item that symbolises their spectres, such as Hitagi's stapler (the claw of a crab), Mayoi's backpack (the shell of a snail), Suruga's arm (the arm of a monkey), Nadeko's hat and jacket (the head and skin of a snake), and Karen's [[Game of Death#Yellow-and-black tracksuit|black and yellow tracksuit]] (the colors of a bee). Although it incorporates elements of fantasy, horror, and action, the series primarily focuses on relationships and conversations between its characters, which make heavy use of [[Nisio Isin]]'s signature [[word play]] and [[metahumor]].\n\n==Media==\n\n===Light novels===\n{{main|List of Monogatari novels}}\nThe ''Monogatari'' series was first written by [[Nisio Isin]] as a series of short stories for [[Kodansha]]'s literary magazine [[Mephisto Prize#Mephisto (magazine)|''Mephisto'']].

series written by [[Nisio Isin]] and illustrated by Vofan. The plot of the series centers around Koyomi Araragi, a third-year high school student who survives a vampire attack and subsequently finds himself helping girls involved with a variety of apparitions, deities, ghosts, beasts, spirits, and other supernatural phenomena. Between November 2006 and April 2019, [[Kodansha]] published 25 volumes in the series under its [[Kodansha Box]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], with plans for at least three more volumes {{as of|2017|July|lc=y}}. Each of the series' 18 story arcs share the common title suffix {{Nihongo|''-monogatari''|\u7269\u8a9e}}.\n\n[[Shaft (company)|Shaft]] has animated the ''Monogatari'' series multiple times since 2009. The first season of the [[anime]] adaptation consists of 30 episodes, which were broadcast in Japan between July 2009 and December 2012. The second season consists of 28 episodes broadcast between July and December 2013, and the third and final season consists of 42 episodes broadcast between December 2014 and June 2019. A prequel anime film trilogy, ''[[Kizumonogatari (film series)|Kizumonogatari]]'', was released in 2016 and 2017. A [[manga]] series illustrated by [[Oh! great]] adapting the series' first arc, ''Bakemonogatari'', began serialization in Kodansha's ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' in March 2018.\n\n==Plot and setting==\n{{see also|List of Monogatari characters}}\nThe ''Monogatari'' series revolves around Koyomi Araragi, a third-year high school student who has almost restored his humanity after briefly becoming a vampire during spring break. One day, a classmate of his, the reclusive Hitagi Senj\u014dgahara, falls down a flight of stairs at school into Koyomi's arms. To his surprise, he discovers that Hitagi weighs almost nothing, in defiance of physics. Despite being threatened to keep away, Koyomi offers his help and introduces her to Meme Oshino, a strange middle-aged man living in an abandoned [[cram school]] who helped reverse his vampirism. Once Koyomi helps solve Hitagi's problem, she decides to become his girlfriend.\n\nAs the series progresses, Koyomi finds himself involved with other girls afflicted by {{Nihongo|\"oddities\"|\u602a\u7570|kaii|{{lit}} \"strangeness\"}}: the ghost of a child named Mayoi Hachikuji; his underclassman Suruga Kanbaru; Nadeko Sengoku, a friend of his sisters; his classmate Tsubasa Hanekawa; and his own younger sisters Karen and Tsukihi. To deal with the apparitions, which feed on human emotions and often take forms symbolically represented by animals, Koyomi relies on supernatural guidance from Oshino and, later, from Shinobu, the once-powerful blonde vampire who attacked him and later assumed the appearance of an eight-year-old girl.\n\nMost heroines have an item that symbolises their spectres, such as Hitagi's stapler (the claw of a crab), Mayoi's backpack (the shell of a snail), Suruga's arm (the arm of a monkey), Nadeko's hat and jacket (the head and skin of a snake), and Karen's [[Game of Death#Yellow-and-black tracksuit|black and yellow tracksuit]] (the colors of a bee). Although it incorporates elements of fantasy, horror, and action, the series primarily focuses on relationships and conversations between its characters, which make heavy use of [[Nisio Isin]]'s signature [[word play]] and [[metahumor]].\n\n==Media==\n\n===Light novels===\n{{main|List of Monogatari novels}}\nThe ''Monogatari'' series was first written by [[Nisio Isin]] as a series of short stories for [[Kodansha]]'s literary magazine [[Mephisto Prize#Mephisto (magazine)|''Mephisto'']].
