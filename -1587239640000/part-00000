It is part of the Nacula District that lies north-west of the [[Fiji|Fijian island]] of [[Viti Levu]].\n\n== Island supplies and logistics ==\n\nTavewa does not have a pier; all supplies have to be loaded onto small landing boats from supply ships stopping between the islands. Depending on the arrival times of the supply boats and the tides, all goods have to be unloaded from the landing boats inplaces in the water in front of the beach. The residents unload and carry all goods from knee- to breast-deep water onto the beach.

Drinking water is a precious resource. Drinking water for tourists is brought in plastic bottles on the supply boats.

In addition to Tavewa residents, the population includes many resort staff who commute from nearby islands in the Yasawa group or from [[Nadi]]. The locals live in [[Bure (Fiji)|bure]]s like those at the resorts. Cooking is usually communal, on fireplaces dotted around the bures.\n\n== Transport ==\n\nTavewa can be regularly reached either by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070305174803/http://www.awesomefiji.com/nee_yasawaflyer.aspx Yasawa Flyer ferry] or the [http://www.turtleairways.com/ Turtle Airways seaplane].\n\nThe vast majority of tourists and supplies arrive on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070305174803/http://www.awesomefiji.com/nee_yasawaflyer.aspx Yasawa Flyer]. It takes the Flyer about four hours to travel between [[Nadi]] and Tavewa, with several stops at the island resorts in-between.\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061112171326/http://www.bugpacific.com/reviews/Fiji/Yasawa_Group/Tavewa/ Tavewa Resort Reviews]\n\n{{coord|-16.627|178.723|type:isle_region:FJ|display=title}}\n\n{{Yasawa}}\n\n{{Islands of Fiji}}\n\n[[Category:Yasawa Islands]]\n[[Category:Ba Province]]\n[[Category:Islands of Fiji]]\n\n\n{{Fiji-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control, removed stub tag", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavewa"}

The Down service was similar.\n\nAll local trains plying between Ormskirk and St Helens called at Rainford Junction, entailing a reverse. None used the 'direct line' between Bushey Lane Junction<ref>{{Harvnb|Pixton|1996|p=92}}</ref> and Randle Junction<ref>{{Harvnb|Pixton|1996|p=98}}</ref> which formed the third side of the triangle shown near the top of the route diagram. That stretch was the preserve of goods trains, diversions and occasional specials.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pixton|1996|p=102}}</ref>\n\n==Private Sidings==\nA siding was provided immediately south of the station for use by the Gamble Estate. It was small scale and was probably only used for agricultural traffic. It was in use in 1916 but seemed to have closed a few years later.<ref>{{Harvnb|Townley|Peden|2002|pp=519\u2013521}}</ref>\n\nIn 1930 a siding was provided for the contractors building the nearby [[East Lancashire Road]]. It had been removed by 28 May 1934 when the road building contract had been completed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Townley|Peden|2002|p=519}}</ref>\n\n{{Disused Rail Start}}\n{{rail line\n| previous = [[Gerards Bridge railway station|Gerards Bridge]]<br /><small>Line and station closed</small>\n| next     = {{stnlnk|Crank Halt}}<br /><small>Line and station closed</small>\n| route    = [[London and North Western Railway]]<br/><small>[[St Helens Canal and Railway]]</small>\n| col      = {{LNWR colour}} }}\n{{s-end}}\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*{{citation|last=Bradshaw|title=Bradshaw's July 1922 Railway Guide (reprint)|year=1986|publisher=Guild Publishing London}}\n*{{citation|last=Pixton|first=Bob|title=The Archive Photographs Series Widnes and St Helens Railways|year=1996|publisher=The Chalford Publishing Company|isbn=0 7524 0751 1}}\n*{{citation|last1=Smith|first1=Paul|last2=Turner|first2=Keith|title=Railway Atlas Then and Now|year=2012|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|isbn=978 0 7110 3695 6}}\n*{{citation|last1=Townley|first1=C H A|last2=Peden|first2=J A|title=Industrial Railways of St Helens, Widnes and Warrington, Part 2|year=2002|publisher=Industrial Railway Society|isbn=1 901556 25 5}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/m/moss%20bank A more detailed history via ''Disused Stations UK'']\n*[http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=17&lat=53.4745&lon=-2.7409&layers=171 The station on an 1888-1913 Overlay OS Map via National Library of Scotland]\n*[http://www.npemap.org.uk/tiles/map.html#350,397,1 The station on an old O.S.
