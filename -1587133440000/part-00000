reviewing footage from over 30 cameras provided by the building owner [[Link REIT]], investigators ruled that Chow could not have been pushed by police officers as the police entered the car park after the estimated time frame of his fall, could not have been hit by beanbags or rubber bullets shot by the police as the distance was too great to reach him, and could not have fallen due to tear gas as no person in the area was affected and no smoke filled the area.<ref name=\"scmp-cwf\" /> However, the cause for the fall could not be determined from the footage.<ref name=\"scmp-cwf\" /> The police said that they would seek security footage from nearby buildings.<ref name=\"scmp-cwf\" />\n\n=== Injuries ===\nIt was reported that Chow had a fractured right [[pelvis]] from likely a lateral

Loveridge\u2019s performance at fullback came in for some comment by the scribes of the time. The general consensus being that he was too hesitant in the fullback position and hung on to the ball too long. The writer for the ''Sun'' (Christchurch) said that he was \u201cweak\u201d, and that \u201che misjudged several kicks, and was tackled in possession on a number of occasions. In addition he missed his man two of three times through lack of determination\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Rugby League/Second Test Match\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Sun (Christchurch), Volume VII, Issue 2023\n| date = 1920-08-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/SUNCH19200809.2.6.6\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>.

The ''Lyttelton Times'' writer described a passage of play where \u201cLoveridge failed to beat [[Harold Wagstaff|Wagstaff]] before kicking.

In fact Loveridge did not even pull on the Auckland jersey. In 1921 and 1922 he continued to play for Marist in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He scored a try in a 27-15 win over [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] at the [[Auckland Domain]] and he kicked 5 goals in other matches <ref>{{cite news\n| title =City\u2019s Easy Victory/Wins to Ponsonby and Newton\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LIII| issue=161\n| date = 1922-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19220710.2.118\n| accessdate = 2019-08-27}}</ref>.

Then on August 7 just 3 days later Loveridge travelled down to Christchurch to make his test debut for New Zealand. The match was played at Lancaster Park with 6,000 spectators present.

Loveridge\u2019s performance at fullback came in for some comment by the scribes of the time. The general consensus being that he was too hesitant in the fullback position and hung on to the ball too long. The writer for the ''Sun'' (Christchurch) said that he was \u201cweak\u201d, and that \u201che misjudged several kicks, and was tackled in possession on a number of occasions. In addition he missed his man two of three times through lack of determination\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Rugby League/Second Test Match\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Sun (Christchurch), Volume VII, Issue 2023\n| date = 1920-08-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/SUNCH19200809.2.6.6\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>. The writer for the ''Star'' said that \u201cLoveridge nearly had the team in difficulties through holding on too long.

The ''Lyttelton Times'' writer described a passage of play where \u201cLoveridge failed to beat [[Harold Wagstaff|Wagstaff]] before kicking. He was collared, and it looked as if the Englishmen were likely to score\u201d and later a passing rush by England \u201cended in [[Billy Stone (rugby league)|Stone]] side stepping Loveridge and dashing over at the corner <ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/English Team Wins Second Test Match\n| page = 9\n| publisher = Lyttelton Times, 9 August 1920\n| date = 1920-08-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/LT19200809.2.71\n| accessdate = 2020-04-17}}</ref>.\n\nThis was to be his only test match for New Zealand. In fact Loveridge did not even pull on the Auckland jersey. In 1921 and 1922 he continued to play for Marist in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He scored a try in a 27-15 win over [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] at the [[Auckland Domain]] and he kicked 5 goals in other matches <ref>{{cite news\n| title =City\u2019s Easy Victory/Wins to Ponsonby and Newton\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LIII| issue=161\n| date = 1922-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19220710.2.118\n| accessdate = 2019-08-27}}</ref>.

He demonstrated organizational ability and populist political instincts. These abilities allowed the SDP to gain in Zagreb blue-collar neighborhoods and attract votes which the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and its then-president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] had considered theirs by default. As such, he proved to be a valuable asset for the Social Democratic Party. In 1993 he became party secretary.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\nConflict between HDZ and SDP manifested in the [[1995 Croatian parliamentary election|1995 parliamentary]] and City of [[Zagreb]] elections, leading to the [[Zagreb Crisis]]: an electoral alliance (in which the SDP was a major partner) won a majority in the Zagreb elections and chose [[Goran Grani\u0107]] as the new mayor, but Franjo Tu\u0111man used a legal loophole to stop Grani\u0107 from taking office. Several subsequent elections were held, with the SDP winning each time and Tu\u0111man promptly removing every candidate. For a time Zagreb was a city without a mayor, which led to public unrest and protests in [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]]. With the final 1997 election of the HDZ candidate [[Marina Matulovi\u0107-Dropuli\u0107]] as the mayor of Zagreb, the crisis faded.

HSS also launched a propaganda campaign against [[Herzegovinians]] in an effort to undermine Bandi\u0107's campaign. The party hoped that the majority of Zagreb voters would turn away from Bandi\u0107. Those expectations were not fulfilled and Bandi\u0107 later used his Herzegovinian background as an advantage, broadening his support among the ordinary citizens of Zagreb.\n\nThe HDZ under Bandi\u0107 eventually lost power in the Croatian capital in 2000.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\n==={{anchor|First and second term (2000\u20132002)}}First and second terms (2000\u20132002)===\n{{see also|2000 Zagreb local elections|2001 Zagreb local elections}}\n\nBandi\u0107 was elected [[mayor]] of Zagreb in 2000<ref name=izbori>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.zgizbori.hr/2000Lokalni/izbori_2000_.html\n | title = Izbori odr\u017eani 7. svibnja 2000.\n | work = Gradski zavod za automatsku obradu podataka\n | accessdate = 2008-07-27\n | language = Croatian\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100129103926/http://www.zgizbori.hr/2000Lokalni/izbori_2000_.html\n | archive-date = 2010-01-29\n | url-status = dead\n}}</ref> and re-elected in the city election in 2001.<ref name=izbori_2001>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.zgizbori.hr/2001Lokalni/rezultati.html\n| title = Izbori odr\u017eani 20. svibnja 2001.\n| work = City Bureau for Automatic Data Processing\n| accessdate = 2008-08-04\n| language = Croatian\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080316190322/http://www.zgizbori.hr/2001Lokalni/rezultati.html\n| archive-date = 2008-03-16\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> His rise in influence among SDP politicians and on the Zagreb political scene created a backlash by the [[Croatian People's Party]] (HNS), the other left-of-center party led by [[Vesna Pusi\u0107]], who did not trust his nationalist populism and his occasional run-ins with the courts. The HNS campaigned against the SDP in the 2000 elections. However, the HNS entered into a coalition with the SDP in 2001.

Bandi\u0107 said that if awarded [[damages]], he would donate the money to the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]. The director of the center, [[Efraim Zuroff]], refused.<ref name=zuroff_auschwitz />\n\nIn January 2006, Bandi\u0107 publicly threatened a journalist working for ''[[Ve\u010dernji list]]''. The journalist asked Bandi\u0107 about an offer from a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] company; Bandi\u0107 replied aggressively, cursing and threatening the journalist. Afterwards, he claimed he had simply spoken to the journalist in a loud voice.<ref name=threatened_journalist />\n\nAs of October 2007 Bandi\u0107 was under investigation by the [[USKOK]] (Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organized Crime) about several deals he made as mayor of Zagreb, including the July 2007 exchange of a lot at the intersection of Maksimirska Street and [[Gojko \u0160u\u0161ak Avenue|\u0160u\u0161ak Avenue]] for a lot in [[Sesvetski Kraljevec]]. A court-appointed expert allowed the exchange at a price of 1,300 kuna per square meter (\u20ac185) for the Sesvete lot (located in the suburbs, outside the [[Zagreb bypass]]) and 2,300 kuna (\u20ac321) for the Maksimirska lot (located in the [[Maksimir]] district, several hundred meters from downtown). New experts considered the lot on Maksimirska Street to be more valuable than the lot in Sesvetski Kraljevec. Thus, a USKOK source testified that Bandi\u0107 made a deal damaging to the city budget. The two companies with whom Bandi\u0107 dealt were headed by inexperienced students, furthering the appearance of impropriety.<ref name=bandic_index_uskok>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.javno.com/en/croatia/clanak.php?id=86401\n |title       = Bandi\u0107 Under Investigation For Corruption\n |accessdate  = 2008-09-28\n |date        = 2007-10-03\n |work        = Javno.hr\n |url-status  = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071004041519/http://www.javno.com/en/croatia/clanak.php?id=86401\n |archivedate = 2007-10-04\n}}</ref><ref name=uskok>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak.aspx?id=360440\n| title = Bandi\u0107 o istrazi USKOK-a: Neka institucije rade svoj posao\n| accessdate = 2008-02-16\n| date = 2007-10-03\n| work = Vijesti.net\n| language = Croatian\n}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 June 2008 the Main Committee of SDP received a letter entitled ''Za \u0161to se, uop\u0107e, danas zala\u017ee SDP?'' (\"What, overall, does the SDP stand for today?\") by [[Dra\u017een Lali\u0107]] (a Croatian [[sociologist]]) which attacked Bandi\u0107 by pointing out his misdeeds and errors and questioning Bandi\u0107's loyalty to the SDP's principles. The letter was sparked partially by the [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] of anti-corruption Zagreb road-authorities director Igor Ra\u0111enovi\u0107, which had not been properly investigated. Another reason was a concert held on [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]] by [[Marko Perkovi\u0107 Thompson]], a singer known to attract an [[Usta\u0161e|usta\u0161a]] audience. Bandi\u0107 supported the concert instead of condemning it, inaccordance with SDP anti-nationalistic principles. Although the letter attacked the SDP as a whole, Bandi\u0107 was considered a key participant in all events described.

He demonstrated organizational ability and populist political instincts. These abilities allowed the SDP to gain in Zagreb blue-collar neighborhoods and attract votes which the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and its then-president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] had considered theirs by default. As such, he proved to be a valuable asset for the Social Democratic Party. In 1993 he became party secretary.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\nConflict between HDZ and SDP manifested in the [[1995 Croatian parliamentary election|1995 parliamentary]] and City of [[Zagreb]] elections, leading to the [[Zagreb Crisis]]: an electoral alliance (in which the SDP was a major partner) won a majority in the Zagreb elections and chose [[Goran Grani\u0107]] as the new mayor, but Franjo Tu\u0111man used a legal loophole to stop Grani\u0107 from taking office. Several subsequent elections were held, with the SDP winning each time and Tu\u0111man promptly removing every candidate. For a time Zagreb was a city without a mayor, which led to public unrest and protests in [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]]. With the final 1997 election of the HDZ candidate [[Marina Matulovi\u0107-Dropuli\u0107]] as the mayor of Zagreb, the crisis faded.

HSS also launched a propaganda campaign against [[Herzegovinians]] in an effort to undermine Bandi\u0107's campaign. The party hoped that the majority of Zagreb voters would turn away from Bandi\u0107. Those expectations were not fulfilled and Bandi\u0107 later used his Herzegovinian background as an advantage, broadening his support among the ordinary citizens of Zagreb.\n\nThe HDZ under Bandi\u0107 eventually lost power in the Croatian capital in 2000.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\n==={{anchor|First and second term (2000\u20132002)}}First and second terms (2000\u20132002)===\n{{see also|2000 Zagreb local elections|2001 Zagreb local elections}}\n\nBandi\u0107 was elected [[mayor]] of Zagreb in 2000<ref name=izbori>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.zgizbori.hr/2000Lokalni/izbori_2000_.html\n | title = Izbori odr\u017eani 7. svibnja 2000.\n | work = Gradski zavod za automatsku obradu podataka\n | accessdate = 2008-07-27\n | language = Croatian\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100129103926/http://www.zgizbori.hr/2000Lokalni/izbori_2000_.html\n | archive-date = 2010-01-29\n | url-status = dead\n}}</ref> and re-elected in the city election in 2001.<ref name=izbori_2001>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.zgizbori.hr/2001Lokalni/rezultati.html\n| title = Izbori odr\u017eani 20. svibnja 2001.\n| work = City Bureau for Automatic Data Processing\n| accessdate = 2008-08-04\n| language = Croatian\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080316190322/http://www.zgizbori.hr/2001Lokalni/rezultati.html\n| archive-date = 2008-03-16\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> His rise in influence among SDP politicians and on the Zagreb political scene created a backlash by the [[Croatian People's Party]] (HNS), the other left-of-center party led by [[Vesna Pusi\u0107]], who did not trust his nationalist populism and his occasional run-ins with the courts. The HNS campaigned against the SDP in the 2000 elections. However, the HNS entered into a coalition with the SDP in 2001.

Bandi\u0107 said that if awarded [[damages]], he would donate the money to the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]. The director of the center, [[Efraim Zuroff]], refused.<ref name=zuroff_auschwitz />\n\nIn January 2006, Bandi\u0107 publicly threatened a journalist working for ''[[Ve\u010dernji list]]''. The journalist asked Bandi\u0107 about an offer from a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] company; Bandi\u0107 replied aggressively, cursing and threatening the journalist. Afterwards, he claimed he had simply spoken to the journalist in a loud voice.<ref name=threatened_journalist />\n\nAs of October 2007 Bandi\u0107 was under investigation by the [[USKOK]] (Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organized Crime) about several deals he made as mayor of Zagreb, including the July 2007 exchange of a lot at the intersection of Maksimirska Street and [[Gojko \u0160u\u0161ak Avenue|\u0160u\u0161ak Avenue]] for a lot in [[Sesvetski Kraljevec]]. A court-appointed expert allowed the exchange at a price of 1,300 kuna per square meter (\u20ac185) for the Sesvete lot (located in the suburbs, outside the [[Zagreb bypass]]) and 2,300 kuna (\u20ac321) for the Maksimirska lot (located in the [[Maksimir]] district, several hundred meters from downtown). New experts considered the lot on Maksimirska Street to be more valuable than the lot in Sesvetski Kraljevec. Thus, a USKOK source testified that Bandi\u0107 made a deal damaging to the city budget. The two companies with whom Bandi\u0107 dealt were headed by inexperienced students, furthering the appearance of impropriety.<ref name=bandic_index_uskok>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.javno.com/en/croatia/clanak.php?id=86401\n |title       = Bandi\u0107 Under Investigation For Corruption\n |accessdate  = 2008-09-28\n |date        = 2007-10-03\n |work        = Javno.hr\n |url-status  = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071004041519/http://www.javno.com/en/croatia/clanak.php?id=86401\n |archivedate = 2007-10-04\n}}</ref><ref name=uskok>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak.aspx?id=360440\n| title = Bandi\u0107 o istrazi USKOK-a: Neka institucije rade svoj posao\n| accessdate = 2008-02-16\n| date = 2007-10-03\n| work = Vijesti.net\n| language = Croatian\n}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 June 2008 the Main Committee of SDP received a letter entitled ''Za \u0161to se, uop\u0107e, danas zala\u017ee SDP?'' (\"What, overall, does the SDP stand for today?\") by [[Dra\u017een Lali\u0107]] (a Croatian [[sociologist]]) which attacked Bandi\u0107 by pointing out his misdeeds and errors and questioning Bandi\u0107's loyalty to the SDP's principles. The letter was sparked partially by the [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] of anti-corruption Zagreb road-authorities director Igor Ra\u0111enovi\u0107, which had not been properly investigated. Another reason was a concert held on [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]] by [[Marko Perkovi\u0107 Thompson]], a singer known to attract an [[Usta\u0161e|usta\u0161a]] audience. Bandi\u0107 supported the concert instead of condemning it, inaccordance with SDP anti-nationalistic principles. Although the letter attacked the SDP as a whole, Bandi\u0107 was considered a key participant in all events described.

A court-appointed expert allowed the exchange at a price of 1,300 kuna per square meter (\u20ac185) for the Sesvete lot (located in the suburbs, outside the [[Zagreb bypass]]) and 2,300 kuna (\u20ac321) for the Maksimirska lot (located in the [[Maksimir]] district, several hundred meters from downtown). New experts considered the lot on Maksimirska Street to be more valuable than the lot in Sesvetski Kraljevec. Thus, a USKOK source testified that Bandi\u0107 made a deal damaging to the city budget.

He is one of Sweden's most famous naval officers, as he in 1704 fought a doomed battle against a superior English force, because he refused to strike the flag of his Swedish man-of-war in recognition of English supremacy. \n==Early life==\nPsilander was the son of a clerk in the Royal Wardrobe, who died when Psilander was eleven years old. Raised by a friend of the father, the Stockholm Alderman Johan Hagemeister, he joined the Navy as a clerk in 1687. Two years later Psilander was promoted to Gunner's Mate, and the following year to Gunner. To gain experience, and achieve promotion, Psilander joined the Dutch Navy during the [[Nine Years' War]], serving as rating and petty officer, fighting in the [[Battle of Beachy Head (1690)]]. Promoted to Sub-Lieutenant in his absence, he returned to Sweden in 1695.<ref name=\"Glete\"/>\n==Wars==\n[[File:Psilander adligt vapen.svg|thumb|Psilander's coat of arm as ennobled contain clear references to the  [[Battle of Orford Ness (1704)]].]]\nAt the outbreak of the [[Great Northern War]], Captain Psilander served as [[Flag Captain]], under Admiral [[Cornelius Anckarstjerna]], escorting King [[Charles XII]] and the Swedish Army to [[P\u00e4rnu]] in Estonia. After having served as Frigate Captain in the [[Bay of Finland]], he became Captain of the ''\u00d6land'', a Swedish ship-of-the line escorting Swedish merchantmen during the [[Seven Years War]]. During one of these expeditions, the event that made him one of Sweden's most famous sea officers occurred. Followed by a squadron of eight English ships-of-the-line and a frigate, he refused to strike his flag or lower the topsails to symbolically recognize the Queen of England's supremacy in the [[English Channel]]. The ensuing [[Battle of Orford Ness (1704)]] left his ship shattered, he and his crew plundered and imprisoned, but all were later released. <ref name=\"Glete\"/>  <ref>Anderson, R. C. (1910). ''Naval Wars in the Baltic.'' London: C. Gilbert-Wood, p. 141.</ref>\n\nPsilander commanded a ship-of-the-line in the [[Battle of K\u00f8ge Bay (1710)]], becoming Deputy Superintendent of HM Shipyard in [[Karlskrona]] the same year. Promoted to [[Schoutbynacht]] and Admiralty Commissioner in 1712, he was also [[ennobled]] the same year. Favoured by the King's patronage since the 1704 battle, he was promoted to Vice-admiral and superintendent of Karlskrona shipyard 1714, and full Admiral in 1715. In 1716 he became governor of [[Gotland]]. The Swedish island in the Baltic was under increasing threats from the ascending Russian Navy, repeatedly landing and plundering. Psilander's mission was to organize the local population in a homeland defence, but this proved unfeasible when the Russian fleet in July 1717 carried out a week-long looting of parts of the island. He then had to devote himself to recruiting personnel and obtaining supplies and tax funds for the King's last military operations.<ref name=\"Glete\">Glete, Jan (1995-97). \"Gustaf Psilander, von.\" ''Svensk Biografiskt Lexikon'', vol. 29, p. 510.</ref>\n\n==Age of Liberty==\n[[File:Kalmar Domkyrka 047.JPG|thumb|Psilander's baronial coat of arms is more elaborate, but still contain references to the 1704 battle.]]\nAfter the death of the King in 1718, Psilander belonged to those favoured by the new regime. He became a Baron in 1719, was suggested as Privy Councillor, and commanded a squadron that blocked the Russian Navy at Gdansk.

He is one of Sweden's most famous naval officers, as he in 1704 fought a doomed battle against a superior English force, because he refused to strike the flag of his Swedish man-of-war in recognition of English supremacy. \n==Early life==\nPsilander was the son of a clerk in the Royal Wardrobe, who died when Psilander was eleven years old. Raised by a friend of the father, the Stockholm Alderman Johan Hagemeister, he joined the Navy as a clerk in 1687. Two years later Psilander was promoted to Gunner's Mate, and the following year to Gunner. To gain experience, and achieve promotion, Psilander joined the Dutch Navy during the [[Nine Years' War]], serving as rating and petty officer, fighting in the [[Battle of Beachy Head (1690)]]. Promoted to Sub-Lieutenant in his absence, he returned to Sweden in 1695.<ref name=\"Glete\"/>\n==Wars==\n[[File:Psilander adligt vapen.svg|thumb|Psilander's coat of arm as ennobled contain clear references to the  [[Battle of Orford Ness (1704)]].]]\nAt the outbreak of the [[Great Northern War]], Captain Psilander served as [[Flag Captain]], under Admiral [[Cornelius Anckarstjerna]], escorting King [[Charles XII]] and the Swedish Army to [[P\u00e4rnu]] in Estonia. After having served as Frigate Captain in the [[Bay of Finland]], he became Captain of the ''\u00d6land'', a Swedish ship-of-the line escorting Swedish merchantmen during the [[Seven Years War]]. During one of these expeditions, the event that made him one of Sweden's most famous sea officers occurred. Followed by a squadron of eight English ships-of-the-line and a frigate, he refused to strike his flag or lower the topsails to symbolically recognize the Queen of England's supremacy in the [[English Channel]]. The ensuing [[Battle of Orford Ness (1704)]] left his ship shattered, he and his crew plundered and imprisoned, but all were later released. <ref name=\"Glete\"/>  <ref>Anderson, R. C. (1910). ''Naval Wars in the Baltic.'' London: C. Gilbert-Wood, p. 141.</ref>\n\nPsilander commanded a ship-of-the-line in the [[Battle of K\u00f8ge Bay (1710)]], becoming Deputy Superintendent of HM Shipyard in [[Karlskrona]] the same year. Promoted to [[Schoutbynacht]] and Admiralty Commissioner in 1712, he was also [[ennobled]] the same year. Favoured by the King's patronage since the 1704 battle, he was promoted to Vice-admiral and superintendent of Karlskrona shipyard 1714, and full Admiral in 1715. In 1716 he became governor of [[Gotland]]. The Swedish island in the Baltic was under increasing threats from the ascending Russian Navy, repeatedly landing and plundering. Psilander's mission was to organize the local population in a homeland defence, but this proved unfeasible when the Russian fleet in July 1717 carried out a week-long looting of parts of the island. He then had to devote himself to recruiting personnel and obtaining supplies and tax funds for the King's last military operations.<ref name=\"Glete\">Glete, Jan (1995-97). \"Gustaf Psilander, von.\" ''Svensk Biografiskt Lexikon'', vol. 29, p. 510.</ref>\n\n==Age of Liberty==\n[[File:Kalmar Domkyrka 047.JPG|thumb|Psilander's baronial coat of arms is more elaborate, but still contain references to the 1704 battle.]]\nAfter the death of the King in 1718, Psilander belonged to those favoured by the new regime.

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10&nbsp;minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite in a different key and tempo than the first. It contains elements of [[art rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would explore on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where his career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career. It was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of the box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Station to Station\" was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} According to Emily Barker of ''[[NME]]'', Bowie \"starved his body of all nutrients (besides [[milk]], red peppers, and [[cocaine]])\" during the song's recording.<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=Emily |title=David Bowie's 40 greatest songs \u2013 as decided by ''NME'' and friends |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=16 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103063248/https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |archivedate=3 November 2019 |date=8 January 2018}}</ref> Bowie would recall later that he could not remember recording the album at all, saying \"I have only flashes of making it.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=234}} Author David Buckley states that Bowie's only memory of the sessions was \"standing with [lead guitarist] [[Earl Slick]] in the studio and asking him to play a [[Chuck Berry]] riff in the same key throughout the opening of 'Station to Station'.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=234}} At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} Structurally, the song builds from a droning, guitar-driven introductory portion that mimics a train building up speed.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Following the train noise, the band begins to enter, with percussion and keyboards playing chords in and out of key.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} What follows is, according to [[Peter Doggett]], a \"slow, hypnotic instrumental march\", led by an atonal guitar riff played by Bowie and Slick with syncopated accents across three bars in {{music|time|4|4}} and one in {{music|time|2|4}}.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}}<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> The march lasts for more than three minutes before Bowie begins his vocals.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> After several verses, at the five-minute mark, a thud of drums signals a change of tempo and key and the band erupts into what Alan Light of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' calls a prog-disco \"celebratory groove\", which lasts for the rest of the track.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /><ref name=\"Needham Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Needham |first1=Alex |title=My favorite album: ''Station to Station'' by David Bowie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 March 2020 |date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406095256/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |archive-date=6 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Doggett likens the section to a [[progressive rock]] suite by the 1970s bands [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} Like the album, the entire song contains elements of [[art rock]].<ref name=\"AllMusic album\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 August 2019|quote=At its heart, ''Station to Station'' is an avant-garde art-rock album, most explicitly on 'TVC 15' and the epic sprawl of the title track|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe train sound effect was created by Slick using [[Flanging|flangers]] and delay effects.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The noise pans from right to left across the stereo channels before fading out using [[feedback]], which Doggett likens to \"disappearing into a tunnel\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} According to [[Nicholas Pegg]], the effect \"acknowledges\" the influence of the 1974 album ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' by the German [[Electronic music|electronic]] band [[Kraftwerk]], which begins with a car starting up and driving across the stereo speakers.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Pegg believes another influence is from [[Edgar Froese]] of the German electronic band [[Tangerine Dream]], whom Bowie befriended during his \"Berlin\" years (1977\u20131979); Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the 'Station to Station' track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]]\",<ref name=Q97X /> the series of 14 images depicting [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his crucifixion]], each symbolising a stopping-point for [[prayer]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, saying: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite&nbsp;[...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. Page was a session musician on Bowie's earliest recordings and had been an occasional acquaintance ever since.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} During the same time Bowie became dependent on cocaine, Page had become dependent on [[heroin]], which Pegg considered \"even more fearful\" than Bowie's addiction.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Led Zeppelin's ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' was released in March 1975,<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Physical Graffiti|others=[[Led Zeppelin]]|year=1975|publisher=[[Swan Song Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SSK 894007}}</ref> months ahead of the ''Station to Station'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Pegg writes: \"It's possible to discern in [\"Station to Station\"] a distinct flavour of the groove, tempo and sense of building tension created by the famous rising riff of ''Physical Graffiti''<nowiki/>'s standout track '[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]'\", an epic track that evokes a \"troubled spiritual journey\" through its music and lyrics.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}}\n\n==Lyrics==\n[[File:The Thin White Duke 76.jpg|thumb|160px|left|alt=David Bowie performing in 1976 and in character as the Thin White Duke|Bowie in character as the Thin White Duke performing on the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]].]]\n\"Station to Station\" introduces Bowie's persona [[the Thin White Duke]], a sinister figure who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often throughout 1976, for Bowie himself.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}}{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Light |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |title=How David Bowie Brought Thin White Duke to Life on 'Station to Station' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040904/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |archive-date=27 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> The persona was noticeably darker than Bowie's previous characters, being described as \"a mad aristocrat\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} an \"amoral zombie\",{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=258}} and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2004|pp=297\u2013300}} For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=24}} The lyrics themselves contain very cryptic messages and direct references, including to the 13th century Jewish mystical system known as the [[Kabbalah]] and [[gnosticism]].<ref name=\"Q97X\">{{cite book| last=Cavanagh | first=David | title=ChangesFiftyBowie | journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q magazine]] |date=February 1997 | pages=52\u201359}}</ref> Bowie would later claim in 1997: \"All the references within [\"Station to Station\"] have to do with the Kabbalah.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Author [[Peter Doggett]] believes the main themes of the track are magic, the arts of legendary musicians, both real and fictitious, the Kabbalah's mythical account of progress from [[Keter|Kether]] to [[Malkuth]], love and cocaine.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Doggett further argues: \"just as [the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' track] \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" offered a catalogue of avenues open to the inquisitive imagination of David Bowie circa 1971, so \"Station to Station\" present a more confused medley of the themes that were haunting his nightmares in the final weeks of 1975.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\nThe Duke introduces himself by saying \"the return of the Thin White Duke/throwing darts in lovers' eyes.\"<ref name=\"Needham Guardian\" /> Darts, or arrows, are interpreted to be a symbol of direction revealing the dynamic of the True Will.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Doggett argues that other than the Thin White Duke, another duke was at the heart of the action: [[Prospero]], the Duke of [[Milan]] and protagonist of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]''.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} He writes that Prospero, like the Thin White Duke, is a \"master of magic\", who can control elements while \"lost in my [magic] circle\", as well as cast spells over \"lovers' eyes\" (mirroring throwing darts), as Prospero does with his daughter [[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]] and her lover [[Ferdinand (The Tempest)|Ferdinand]] over the course of the play.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=285\u2013286}} Fixation with the English [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] is evident in such phrases as \"[[White Stains|white stains]]\", the name of a book of poetry by Crowley,{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=7}} who was previously mentioned by Bowie on \"Quicksand\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Once the song changes into the prog-disco section, the lyrics become brighter.

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10&nbsp;minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite in a different key and tempo than the first. It contains elements of [[art rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would explore on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where his career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career. It was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of the box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now?

Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0915\u0941\u0932 \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0928 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u0940) which means the town of god. It boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were over 400 [[Jain temples]]. Delwara was the center of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Around middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara (Mewar). Descendants of Raja Sagar sacrificed their lives whilst fighting alongside Ranas of [[Mewar]] against [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim]] invaders. Raja Sagar was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan of Oswals. Sagar's son, Kunwar Bohitya was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.\u00a0 Samdhar, a grandson of Bohitya and a Deora [[Chauhan]], was the first man in his genealogy to convert to [[Jainism]].{{Multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=April 2020}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox settlement \n| name           = Delwara\n| other_name     = \n| settlement_type = Sub-Tehsil\n| image_skyline   = \n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = \n| nickname = \"Devkul Patan Nagri\"\n| pushpin_map             = India Rajasthan#India\n| pushpin_label_position  = right\n| pushpin_map_alt         = Delwara\n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location in Rajasthan, India\n| coordinates             = {{coord|24.7752|N|73.7463|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type        = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name        = {{IND}}\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States and union territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[List of districts of India|District]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Rajasthan]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Rajsamand district|Rajsamand]]\n| established_date        = 224-215 BC\n| founder                 = \n| named_for               = \n| governing_body          = \n| leader_title            = \n| leader_name             = \n| unit_pref               = Metric\n| elevation_m             = 586\n| population_total        = 4429\n| population_as_of        = 2011\n| population_footnotes=<ref>http://censusindia.gov.in/</ref>\n| population_density_km2  = \n| literacy_rate = 76.7\n| demographics_type1     = Languages\n| demographics1_title1   = Official\n| demographics1_info1    = [[Hindi]]\n| demographics1_title2   = {{no wrap|Additional Official}}\n| demographics1_info2    = [[English language|English]]\n| demographics1_title3   = Regional\n| demographics1_info3   = [[Mewari language|Mewari]]\n| timezone1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +5:30\n| postal_code_type        = [[Postal Index Number|PIN]]\n| postal_code             = 313202\n| area_code               = +91- 2952\n| area_code_type          = Telephone code\n| registration_plate      = RJ-30\n| blank1_name_sec1        = Nearest Places \n| blank1_info_sec1        = [[Udaipur]], [[Nathdwara]], [[Rajsamand]], [[Haldighati]], [[Kumbhalgarh]], [[Chittorgarh]]\n| blank2_name_sec1        = [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|Climate]]\n| blank2_info_sec1        = [[Semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|BSh]]\n|}}\n__FORCETOC__\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town ==\nThe ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== City of learning and education ===\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n=== Grandeur of Jain temples ===\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen goddesses of knowledge, (\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940)  are carved on the ceiling.\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt. Abu]] are called [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930)? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near [[Mount Abu]] which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. \n\nThe temple is known as [[Vimal Vasahi]] (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at [[Chandravati]] (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930). These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]). \n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized [[Nadol]] (near [[Jodhpur]]) from the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutbud-din Aibak]] of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to [[Bhinmal]] and [[Sanchore|Sanchor]], before seizing [[Jalore]] from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipal was progenitor of [[Songara]] clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref name=\":0\">Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref>\n\nChauhans have 24 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of [[Jalore]], [[Chandravati]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]] belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.\n\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar (now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. [[Jagir|Jagirdars]] of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.

Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, \u201cDebari means window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul Deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. \n\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|Gaurishankar Ojha]] writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

His only daughter was married to Rao Samant Singh of Jalore, who had two queens. Sagar was born to Delwara Baiji. Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of [[Jalore]], she returned to her father's place, Delwara. Since Rao Bhim Singh, did not have any male child, his grandson Sagar, a Deora Chauhan, ascended the throne of Delwara.<ref>Seth Rajmal Lalwani; Sukhsampat Raj Bhandari and others (1939).

He was the progenitor of [[Karam Chand Bachhawat|Bachhawat]] clan. Raja Sagar was blessed with three sons - Bohitya, Gangadas and Jaisingh. Whenever there was invasion from Muslims, Rana Jaitra Singh (1213\u201353) called Raja Sagar for help in the battle. Raja Sagar always came along with army and fought valiantly against the invading Muslims.<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\">Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980).

While he ensured full protection for Jaitra Singh, as Delwada's army fought fearlessly alongside Mewar army. Sultan Iltutmish destroyed temples after temples in and around Nagda and Delwara. The villages were burnt. <br>\nDr Shri Krishan Jugnu, writes in his book, Nandeshma Abhilekh (Hindi) \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh<ref>Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh (2015). Lokchetna Prakashan.</ref>\n<blockquote>''\u201cThis fierce battle was fought in the valley near Nagda towards Gogunda. Besides Gohils, there were brave soldiers from Chauhans, Chandanas, Solankis, Parmars, Chaarans and Tribals who fought for Mewar. They gave a tough fight to Sultan\u2019s army. However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14<sup>th</sup> century, according to a mythological tradition of offering water tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n\n===Raja Bohitya influenced by Jain philosophy===\nRaja Sagar's son Raja Bohitya was also brave and intelligent like his father and ruled Delwara during the time of Rawal Samar Singh (1273\u20131302) and Rana Ratan Singh (1302\u20131303). Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara. It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref>\n\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \n\n=== Raja Bohitya sacrifices his life for Mewar ===\nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan. Rawat Publications.</ref>\n\n=== Rana Shree Karan Sacrifices his Life for Mewar ===\nAfter Raja Bohitya, his eldest son Raja Shree Karan ascended to the throne of Delwara. Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of Rana Shree Karan looted the treasury of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] (1325-51) while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] of Delhi brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near [[Mandalgarh]]. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting Maharana Hamir Singh I. Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts. But he died in 1351 at Delhi. Mewar established their supremacy within 50 years of the sack of Chittorgarh and Maharana Hamir Singh I recaptured the Fort in 1353.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all hisbrothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d''<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\"/></blockquote>\nAfter the death of Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of Gurjar \u2013 Patan (Anhilpur) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to Chittor to settle down. Later his descendant Bachhraj became Dewan of Jodhpur and founding Dewan of Bikaner. Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, the Kingdom of Mewar was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509\u20131527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> <br>\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar?

Sagar's son, Kunwar Bohitya was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.\u00a0 Samdhar, a grandson of Bohitya and a Deora [[Chauhan]], was the first man in his genealogy to convert to [[Jainism]].{{Multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=April 2020}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox settlement \n| name           = Delwara\n| other_name     = \n| settlement_type = Sub-Tehsil\n| image_skyline   = \n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = \n| nickname = \"Devkul Patan Nagri\"\n| pushpin_map             = India Rajasthan#India\n| pushpin_label_position  = right\n| pushpin_map_alt         = Delwara\n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location in Rajasthan, India\n| coordinates             = {{coord|24.7752|N|73.7463|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type        = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name        = {{IND}}\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States and union territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[List of districts of India|District]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Rajasthan]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Rajsamand district|Rajsamand]]\n| established_date        = 224-215 BC\n| founder                 = \n| named_for               = \n| governing_body          = \n| leader_title            = \n| leader_name             = \n| unit_pref               = Metric\n| elevation_m             = 586\n| population_total        = 4429\n| population_as_of        = 2011\n| population_footnotes=<ref>http://censusindia.gov.in/</ref>\n| population_density_km2  = \n| literacy_rate = 76.7\n| demographics_type1     = Languages\n| demographics1_title1   = Official\n| demographics1_info1    = [[Hindi]]\n| demographics1_title2   = {{no wrap|Additional Official}}\n| demographics1_info2    = [[English language|English]]\n| demographics1_title3   = Regional\n| demographics1_info3   = [[Mewari language|Mewari]]\n| timezone1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +5:30\n| postal_code_type        = [[Postal Index Number|PIN]]\n| postal_code             = 313202\n| area_code               = +91- 2952\n| area_code_type          = Telephone code\n| registration_plate      = RJ-30\n| blank1_name_sec1        = Nearest Places \n| blank1_info_sec1        = [[Udaipur]], [[Nathdwara]], [[Rajsamand]], [[Haldighati]], [[Kumbhalgarh]], [[Chittorgarh]]\n| blank2_name_sec1        = [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|Climate]]\n| blank2_info_sec1        = [[Semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|BSh]]\n|}}\n__FORCETOC__\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town ==\nThe ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== City of learning and education ===\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n=== Grandeur of Jain temples ===\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen goddesses of knowledge, (\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940)  are carved on the ceiling.\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt. Abu]] are called [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930)? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near [[Mount Abu]] which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. \n\nThe temple is known as [[Vimal Vasahi]] (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at [[Chandravati]] (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930). These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]). \n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized [[Nadol]] (near [[Jodhpur]]) from the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutbud-din Aibak]] of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to [[Bhinmal]] and [[Sanchore|Sanchor]], before seizing [[Jalore]] from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipal was progenitor of [[Songara]] clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref name=\":0\">Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref>\n\nChauhans have 24 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of [[Jalore]], [[Chandravati]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]] belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.\n\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar (now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. [[Jagir|Jagirdars]] of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><blockquote>''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle.

Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, \u201cDebari means window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul Deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. \n\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|Gaurishankar Ojha]] writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

His only daughter was married to Rao Samant Singh of Jalore, who had two queens. Sagar was born to Delwara Baiji. Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of [[Jalore]], she returned to her father's place, Delwara.

He was the progenitor of [[Karam Chand Bachhawat|Bachhawat]] clan. Raja Sagar was blessed with three sons - Bohitya, Gangadas and Jaisingh. Whenever there was invasion from Muslims, Rana Jaitra Singh (1213\u201353) called Raja Sagar for help in the battle. Raja Sagar always came along with army and fought valiantly against the invading Muslims.<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\">Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980).

Besides Gohils, there were brave soldiers from Chauhans, Chandanas, Solankis, Parmars, Chaarans and Tribals who fought for Mewar. They gave a tough fight to Sultan\u2019s army. However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14<sup>th</sup> century, according to a mythological tradition of offering water tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n\n===Raja Bohitya influenced by Jain philosophy===\nRaja Sagar's son Raja Bohitya was also brave and intelligent like his father and ruled Delwara during the time of Rawal Samar Singh (1273\u20131302) and Rana Ratan Singh (1302\u20131303). Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara.

After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \n\n=== Raja Bohitya sacrifices his life for Mewar ===\nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan.

Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of Rana Shree Karan looted the treasury of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] (1325-51) while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] of Delhi brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near [[Mandalgarh]]. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting Maharana Hamir Singh I. Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts. But he died in 1351 at Delhi.

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all hisbrothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d''<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\"/></blockquote>\nAfter the death of Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of Gurjar \u2013 Patan (Anhilpur) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to Chittor to settle down. Later his descendant Bachhraj became Dewan of Jodhpur and founding Dewan of Bikaner. Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, the Kingdom of Mewar was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509\u20131527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> <br>\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar? It is yet tobe researched and established.<br>\n\n\n{{chart top| '''<br>(1143* - 1350 AD)<br>Genealogical Tree \u2013 Jalore-Sirohi-Delwara<br>Songara / Deora Chauhan Dynasty<br>Rao Alhana to Raja Sagar'''}}\n<center>\n{{Tree chart/start}}\n{{Tree chart|Tit  |WHITE| | |WHITE='''Rao Alhana <br> Nadol 1143*'''|boxstyle_WHITE = background-color: #FB845B;|Tit=Rulers of Mewar - State Capitals|boxstyle_Tit = background-color: #F0F0EF; }} \n{{Tree chart| | | | | |!| | | | | }}\n{{Tree chart|Tit  |WHITE| WHITE='''Rao  Kirtipal <br> Jalore 1181'''|boxstyle_WHITE = background-color: #5BFBE8;|Tit=Rawal Kshem Singh / Rawal Samant Singh (1168- 1182*) - Ahar / Dungarpur <br> Rao Kirtipal invades Ahar and takes over Mewar <br> Settles Deora  Chauhans around Ahar / Girva |boxstyle_Tit = background-color: #F0F0EF; }} \n{{Tree chart| | | | | |!| | | | | }}\n{{Tree chart|Tit  |WHITE| WHITE='''Rao  Samar Singh <br> Jalore 1182'''|boxstyle_WHITE = background-color: #5BFBE8;|Tit=Rawal Samant Singh - Dungarpur <br> (Kshem Singh was forced to move his capital to Dungarpur due to Muslim Invasions) |boxstyle_Tit = background-color: #F0F0EF; }} \n{{Tree chart| | | | | |!| | | | | }}\n{{Tree chart|Tit  |WHITE| WHITE='''Rao  Uday Singh <br> Jalore'''|boxstyle_WHITE = background-color: #5BFBE8;|Tit=Rawal Kumar Singh / Manthan Singh / Padma Singh - Dungarpur |boxstyle_Tit = background-color: #F0F0EF; }}\n{{Tree chart| | | | ,|- |^|- |.| | | }}\n{{Tree chart|Tit|ONE| |TWO| ONE='''Rao  Chargideo <br> Jalore'''|boxstyle_ONE = background-color: #5BFBE8;|TWO='''Rao Man Singh <br> Jalore / Sirohi <br> 1213-28'''|boxstyle_TWO = background-color: #CFFB5B;|Tit=Rawal Jaitra Singh (1213-53) - Nagda|boxstyle_Tit = background-color: #F0F0EF; }}\n{{Tree chart/end}}\n</center>\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n== Delightful places <ref>https://wikitravel.org/en/Delwara</ref> ==\n'''Devi Garh Palace''' - This 18th century palace in the village of Delwara has undergone years of restoration and rebuilding.

Being one of the most determinative events in Hungary's modern history, it is also one of the cornerstones of the Hungarian national identity. The crucial turning point of the events were the [[April laws]] which were ratified by King [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]], however the new young Austrian monarch [[Franz Joseph I]] arbitrarily revoked the laws without any legal competence. This unconstitutional act irreversibly escalated the conflict between the Hungarian parliament and Franz Joseph. The new constrained [[Stadion Constitution]] of Austria, the revocation of the April laws and the Austrian military campaign against the Kingdom of Hungary resulted in the fall of the pacifist [[Lajos Batthy\u00e1ny|Batthy\u00e1ny government]] (who searched agreement with the court) and led to the sudden emergence of [[Lajos Kossuth]]'s followers in the parliament, who demanded the full independence of Hungary. The Austrian military intervention in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] resulted in strong anti-Habsburg sentiment among Hungarians, thus the events in Hungary grew into a war for total [[independence]] from the [[Habsburg dynasty]].\n\nAfter a series of serious Austrian defeats in 1849, the Austrian Empire came close to the brink of collapse. The young emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] had to call for Russian help in the name of the [[Holy Alliance]].<ref>Eric Roman: Austria-Hungary & the Successor States: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present -PAGE: 67, Publisher: Infobase Publishing, 2003 {{ISBN|9780816074693}}</ref> Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] answered, and sent a 200,000 strong army with 80,000 auxiliary forces. Finally, the joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian forces. After the restoration of Habsburg power, Hungary was placed under brutal [[martial law]].<ref>The Making of the West: Volume C, Lynn Hunt, Pages 683\u2013684</ref>\n\nThe anniversary of the Revolution's outbreak, 15 March, is one of Hungary's three [[Public holidays in Hungary|national holidays]].\n\n==Hungary before the Revolution==\nThe Kingdom of Hungary had always maintained a separate legal system and separate parliament, the [[Diet of Hungary]], even after the Austrian Empire was created in 1804.<ref> In 1804 Emperor Franz assumed the title of Emperor of Austria for all the ''[[Erblande]]'' of the dynasty and for the other Lands, including Hungary.

Hungary's central government structures remained well separated from the imperial government. The country was governed by the Council of Lieutenancy of Hungary (the Gubernium) - located in [[Bratislava|Pozsony]] and later in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] - and by the Hungarian Royal Court Chancellery in Vienna.<ref>\u00c9va H.

[[Ign\u00e1c Martinovics]] worked as a secret agent for the new Holy Roman Emperor, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], until 1792. In his Oratio pro Leopoldo II, he explicitly declares that only authority derived from a [[social contract]] should be recognized; he saw the aristocracy as the enemy of mankind, because they prevented people from becoming educated. In another of his works, Catechism of People and Citizens, he argued that citizens tend to oppose any repression and that sovereignty resides with the people. He also became a Freemason, and was in favour of the adoption of a federal republic in Hungary. As a member of the Hungarian Jacobins, he was considered an idealistic forerunner of revolutionary thought by some, and an unscrupulous adventurer by others. He was in charge of stirring up a revolt against the nobility among the Hungarian serfs. For these subversive acts, Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, dismissed Martinovics and his boss, Ferenc Gotthardi, the former chief of the secret police. He was executed, together with six other prominent Jacobins, in May 1795. More than 42 members of the republican secret society were arrested, including the poet [[J\u00e1nos Bats\u00e1nyi]] and linguist [[Ferenc Kazinczy]]<ref>Charles W.

In the latter years of Francis I the dark shadow of Metternich's policy of \"stability\" fell across the kingdom, and the forces of reactionary absolutism were everywhere supreme. But beneath the surface a strong popular current was beginning to run in a contrary direction. Hungarian society, affected by western Liberalism, but without any direct help from abroad, was preparing for the future emancipation. Writers, savants, poets, artists, noble and plebeian, layman and cleric, without any previous concert, or obvious connection, were working towards that ideal of political liberty which was to unite all the Magyars. Mih\u00e1ly V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty, Ferenc K\u00f6lcsey, Ferencz Kazinczy and his associates, to mention but a few of many great names, were, consciously or unconsciously, as the representatives of the renascent national literature, accomplishing a political mission, and their pens proved no less efficacious than the swords of their ancestors.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1825 [[Emperor Francis II]] convened the Diet in response to growing concerns amongst the Hungarian nobility about taxes and the diminishing economy, after the Napoleonic wars. This \u2013 and the reaction to the reforms of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor#Ruling emperor<!-- see sub-chapter \"Reaction\" as well -->|Joseph II]] \u2013 started what is known as the Reform Period ({{lang-hu|reformkor}}).{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} But the Nobles still retained their privileges of paying no taxes and not giving the vote to the masses.\n\nThe influential Hungarian politician Count [[Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi]] recognized the need to bring the country the advances of the more developed West European countries, such as England.\n\nIt was a direct attack upon the constitution which, to use the words of Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi, first \"startled the nation out of its sickly drowsiness\". In 1823, when the reactionary powers were considering joint action to suppress the revolution in Spain, the government, without consulting the diet, imposed a war-tax and called out the recruits. The county assemblies instantly protested against this illegal act, and Francis I was obliged, at the diet of 1823, to repudiate the action of his ministers. But the estates felt that the maintenance of their liberties demanded more substantial guarantees than the dead letter of ancient laws. Sz\u00e9chenyi, who had resided abroad and studied Western institutions, was the recognized leader of all those who wished to create a new Hungary out of the old. For years he and his friends educated public opinion by issuing innumerable pamphlets in which the new Liberalism was eloquently expounded. In particular Sz\u00e9chenyi insisted that the people must not look exclusively to the government, or even to the diet, for the necessary reforms. Society itself must take the initiative by breaking down the barriers of class exclusiveness and reviving a healthy public spirit. The effect of this teaching was manifest at the diet of 1832, when the Liberals in the Lower Chamber had a large majority, prominent among whom were Ferenc De\u00e1k and \u00d6d\u00f6n Beothy. In the Upper House, however, the magnates united with the government to form a conservative party obstinately opposed to any project of reform, which frustrated all the efforts of the Liberals.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe new rising political star of the mid 1830s was [[Lajos Kossuth]], who started to rival with the popularity of Sz\u00e9chenyi due to his talent as orator in the liberal fraction of the parliament. Kossuth called for broader parliamentary democracy, rapid industrialization, general taxation, economic expansion through exports, and the abolition of serfdom and aristocratic privileges (equality before the law). The alarm of the government at the power and popularity of the Liberal party induced it, soon after the accession of the new king, the emperor Ferdinand I (1835\u20131848), to attempt to crush the reform movement by arresting and imprisoning the most active agitators among them, Lajos Kossuth and [[Mikl\u00f3s Wessel\u00e9nyi]]. But the nation was no longer to be cowed. The diet of 1839 refused to proceed to business till the political prisoners had been released, and, while in the Lower Chamber the reforming majority was larger than ever, a Liberal party was now also formed in the Upper House under the leadership of Count Louis Batthy\u00e1ny and Baron Joseph Eotvos. From 1000AD up to 1844, Latin language was the official language of administration, legislation and schooling in the Kingdom of Hungary.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Two progressive measures of the highest importance were passed by this diet, one making Magyar the official language of Hungary, the other freeing the peasants' holdings from all feudal obligations.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe results of the diet of 1839 did not satisfy the advanced Liberals, while the opposition of the government and of the Upper House still further embittered the general discontent. The chief exponent of this temper was the Pesti Hirlap, Hungary's first political newspaper, founded in 1841 by Kossuth, whose articles, advocating armed reprisals if necessary, inflamed the extremists but alienated Sz\u00e9chenyi, who openly attacked Kossuth's opinions. The polemic on both sides was violent; but, as usual, the extreme views prevailed, and on the assembling of the diet of 1843 Kossuth was more popular than ever, while the influence of Sz\u00e9chenyi had sensibly declined. The tone of this diet was passionate, and the government was fiercely attacked for interfering with the elections. A new party called as [[Opposition Party (Hungary)|Opposition party]] was created, which united the reform oriented Liberals, to oppose the conservatives. Fresh triumphs were won by the Liberals (the Opposition Party). Magyar was now declared to be the language of the schools and the law-courts as well as of the legislature; mixed marriages were legalized; and official positions were thrown open to non-nobles.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===\"Long debate\" of reformers in the press (1841\u20131848)===\nThe interval between the diet of 1843 and that of 1847 saw a complete disintegration and transformation of the various political parties. Sz\u00e9chenyi openly joined the government, while the moderate Liberals separated from the extremists and formed a new party, the Centralists. \n\n[[File:Pilvax Pest Preiszler.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The entrance room of the Pilvax coffee palace at [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] in the 1840s]]\n[[File:Pet\u0151fi Nemzeti M\u00fazeum.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The recitation of the National Song at the National Museum]]\n[[File:A szabadsajt\u00f3 els\u0151 term\u00e9ke Pesten 1848. m\u00e1rcius 15.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The crowd captured the Landerer & Heckenast printing house, where they printed the 12 points and the National Song.

Sz\u00e9chenyi believed that economic, political and social reforms should proceed slowly and with care, in order to avoid the potentially disastrous prospect of violent interference from the Habsburg dynasty. Sz\u00e9chenyi was aware of the spread of Kossuth's ideas in Hungarian society, which he took to overlook the need for a good relationship with the Habsburg dynasty.\n\nKossuth, for his part, rejected the role of the aristocracy, and questioned established norms of social status. In contrast to Sz\u00e9chenyi, Kossuth believed that in the process of social reform it would be impossible to restrain civil society in a passive role. He warned against attempting to exclude wider social movements from political life, and supported democracy, rejecting the primacy of elites and the government. In 1885, he labeled Sz\u00e9chenyi a liberal elitist aristocrat, while Sz\u00e9chenyi considered Kossuth to be a democrat.<ref>Mih\u00e1ly Lack\u00f3: ''Sz\u00e9chenyi \u00e9s Kossuth vit\u00e1ja'', Gondolat, 1977.</ref>\n\nSz\u00e9chenyi was an isolationist politician, while Kossuth saw strong relations and collaboration with international liberal and progressive movements as essential for the success of liberty.<ref>See: Lacko p. 47</ref>\n\nSz\u00e9chenyi based his economic policy on the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' principles practiced by the [[British Empire]], while Kossuth supported protective tariffs due to the comparatively weak Hungarian industrial sector. While Kossuth envisioned the construction of a rapidly industrialized country, Sz\u00e9chenyi wanted to preserve the traditionally strong agricultural sector as the main characteristic of the economy.<ref>''Gr\u00f3f Sz\u00e9chenyi Istv\u00e1n \u00edr\u00f3i \u00e9s h\u00edrlapi vit\u00e1ja Kossuth Lajossal'' [Count Stephen Sz\u00e9chenyi,s Literary and Publicistic Debate with Louis Kossuth], ed.

This was also the last election which was based on the parliamentary system of the old feudal estates. All efforts to bring about an understanding between the government and the opposition were fruitless. Kossuth demanded not merely the redress of actual grievances, but a liberal reform which would make grievances impossible in the future. In the highest circles a dissolution of the diet now seemed to be the sole remedy; but, before it could be carried out, tidings of the February revolution in Paris reached Pressburg on the 1st of March, and on the 3rd of March Kossuth's motion for the appointment of an independent, responsible ministry was accepted by the Lower House. The moderates, alarmed not so much by the motion itself as by its tone, again tried to intervene; but on the 13th of March the Vienna revolution broke out, and the Emperor, yielding to pressure or panic, appointed Count Louis Batthy\u00e1ny premier of the first Hungarian responsible ministry, which included Kossuth, Sz\u00e9chenyi and De\u00e1k.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Hungary |volume=13 |pages=915\u2013918 |first1=Robert Nisbet |last1=Bain |first2=Walter Alison |last2=Phillips |inline=1}}</ref>\n\n==The bloodless revolution in Pest==\n{{further|12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848}}\n[[File:Magyar kok\u00e1rda.png|thumb|left|100px|The Hungarian [[cockade]] used in 1848]]\n\nThe crisis came from abroad - as Kossuth expected - and he used it to the full. On 3 March 1848, shortly after the news of the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in France|revolution in Paris]] had arrived, in a speech of surpassing power he demanded parliamentary government for Hungary and constitutional government for the rest of Austria. He appealed to the hope of the Habsburgs, \"our beloved Archduke [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]]\" (then seventeen years old), to perpetuate the ancient glory of the dynasty by meeting half-way the aspirations of a free people. He at once became the leader of the European revolution; his speech was read aloud in the streets of [[Vienna]] to the mob by which [[Metternich]] was overthrown (13 March), and when a deputation from the Diet visited Vienna to receive the assent of Emperor Ferdinand to their petition it was Kossuth who received the chief ovation. The arrival of the news of the revolution in Paris, and Kossuth's German speech about freedom and human rights had whipped up the passions of Austrian crowd in Vienna on March 13.<ref>Charles Frederick Henningsen: Kossuth and 'The Times', by the author of 'The revelations of Russia'. 1851 -PAGE: 10</ref>\nWhile Viennese masses celebrated Kossuth as their hero, revolution broke out in Buda on 15 March; Kossuth traveled home immediately.<ref>Peter F.

On the morning of March 15, 1848, revolutionaries marched around the city of Pest, reading [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]]'s [[Nemzeti dal]] (National Song) and the [[12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848|12 points]] (the twelve demands of theirs) to the crowd (which swelled to thousands). Declaring an end to all forms of censorship, they visited the printing presses of Landerer and Heckenast and printed Pet\u0151fi's poem together with the demands. A mass demonstration was held in front of the newly built National Museum, after which the group left for the Buda Chancellery (the Office of the Governor-General) on the other bank of the Danube.\n\nThe bloodless mass demonstrations in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] and [[Buda]] forced the Imperial governor to accept all twelve of their demands.\n\nAustria had its own problems with the [[Vienna Revolt|revolution in Vienna]] that year, and it initially acknowledged Hungary's government. Therefore, the Governor-General's officers, acting in the name of the King appointed Hungary's new parliament with [[Lajos Batthy\u00e1ny]] as its first Prime Minister. The Austrian monarchy also made other concessions{{Which|date=July 2011}} to subdue the Vienna masses: on 13 March 1848, Prince [[Klemens von Metternich]] was made to resign his position as the Austrian Government's Chancellor.

Hungary had, to all intents and purposes, become an independent state bound to Austria only by the Austrian Archduke as Palatine.<ref name=EB1911/> The new government approved a sweeping reform package, referred to as the \"[[April laws]]\", which created a democratic political system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dragon.unideb.hu/~kltegimn/CLASSES/12C/HTM/PZ/HU/APR21.HTM |title=''Az \u00e1prilisi t\u00f6rv\u00e9nyek'' (English: \"The April laws\") |language=Hungarian |accessdate=28 June 2011 |date=March 22, 1999 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716180039/http://dragon.unideb.hu/~kltegimn/CLASSES/12C/HTM/PZ/HU/APR21.HTM |archivedate=16 July 2011 }}</ref> The newly established government also demanded that the Habsburg Empire spend all taxes they received from Hungary in Hungary itself, and that the Parliament should have authority over the Hungarian regiments of the Habsburg Army.\n\nThe new suffrage law (Act V of 1848) transformed the old feudal estates based parliament ([[The Estates|Estates General]]) into a democratic representative parliament. This law offered the widest suffrage right in Europe at the time.<ref>prof.

The reform oriented political forces won the elections. The electoral system and franchise were similar to the contemporary British system.<ref>Steven A. Seidman and Peter Lang. ''Posters, Propaganda, and Persuasion in Election Campaigns Around the World''. p. 201</ref>\n\nAt that time the internal affairs and foreign policy of Hungary were not stable, and Batthy\u00e1ny faced many problems. His first and most important act was to organize the armed forces and the local governments. He insisted that the Austrian army, when in Hungary, would come under Hungarian law, and this was conceded by the Austrian Empire. He tried to repatriate conscript soldiers from Hungary. He established the [[Organisation of Militiamen]], whose job was to ensure internal security of the country.\n\nBatthy\u00e1ny was a very capable leader, but he was stuck in the middle of a clash between the Austrian monarchy and the Hungarian separatists. He was devoted to the [[constitutional monarchy]] and aimed to keep the constitution, but the Emperor was dissatisfied with his work. \n\n[[Josip Jela\u010di\u0107]] was [[Ban of Croatia|''Ban'' (Viceroy) of Croatia and Dalmatia]], regions included in the Kingdom of Hungary. He was opposed to the new Hungarian government, and raised troops in his domains.\n\nIn the summer of 1848, the Hungarian government, seeing the civil war ahead, tried to get the Habsburgs' support against Jela\u010di\u0107. They offered to send troops to northern Italy. In August 1848, the Imperial Government in Vienna officially ordered the Hungarian government in Pest not to form an army.\n\nOn 29 August, with the assent of parliament, Batthy\u00e1ny  went with [[Ferenc De\u00e1k]] to the Emperor to ask him to order the Serbs to capitulate and stop Jela\u010di\u0107, who was going to attack Hungary. But Jela\u010di\u0107 went ahead and invaded Hungary to dissolve the Hungarian government, without any order from Austria.\n\nThough the Emperor formally relieved Jela\u010di\u0107 of his duties, Jela\u010di\u0107 and his army invaded [[Me\u0111imurje (region)|Murak\u00f6z (Me\u0111imurje)]] and the Southern [[Transdanubia]]n parts of Hungary on 11 September 1848.\n\nAfter the Austrian revolution in Vienna was defeated, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] replaced his uncle [[Ferdinand I of Austria]], who was not of sound mind. Franz Joseph didn't recognise Batthy\u00e1ny's second premiership, which began on 25 September. Also, Franz Joseph was not recognized as \"King of Hungary\" by the Hungarian parliament, and he was not crowned as \"King of Hungary\" until 1867. In the end, the final break between Vienna and Pest occurred when Field-Marshal [[Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg]] was given control of every army in Hungary (including Jela\u010di\u0107's). He went to Hungary where he was mobbed and viciously murdered. Following his murder the Imperial court dissolved the Hungarian Diet and appointed Jela\u010di\u0107 as Regent.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nMeanwhile, Batthy\u00e1ny travelled again to Vienna to seek a compromise with the new Emperor. His efforts remained unsuccessful, because Franz Joseph refused to accept the reform laws. This was an unconstitutional deed, because the laws were already signed by his uncle, and the monarch had no right to revoke laws which were already signed.\n\nHungarian liberals in Pest saw this as an opportunity. In September 1848, the Diet made concessions to the Pest Uprising, so as not to break up the Austro-Hungarian Union. But the counter-revolutionary forces were gathering. After many{{Quantify|date=January 2014}} local victories, the combined Bohemian and Croatian armies entered Pest on 5 January 1849.<ref>{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Gazi |title=A History of Croatia |publisher=Barnes and Noble Books |place=New York |year=1973 |page=150}}</ref>\n\nSo Batthy\u00e1ny and his government resigned, except for Kossuth, Szemere, and M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros. Later, on [[Archduke Stephen, Palatine of Hungary|Palatine Stephen]]'s request, Batthy\u00e1ny became Prime Minister again. On 13 September Batthy\u00e1ny announced a rebellion and requested that the Palatine lead them. However the Palatine, under the Emperor's orders, resigned and left Hungary.\n\nHungary now had war raging on three fronts: Jela\u010di\u0107's [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatian]] troops to the South, [[Hungarians in Romania|Romanians]] in [[Banat]] and in [[Transylvania]] to the East, and Austria to the west.\n\nThe Hungarian government was in serious military crisis due to the lack of soldiers, therefore they sent Kossuth (a brilliant orator) to recruit volunteers for the new Hungarian army. While Jela\u010di\u0107 was marching on Pest, Kossuth went from town to town rousing the people to the defense of the country, and the popular force of the Honv\u00e9d was his creation.\n\nWith the help of Kossuth's recruiting speeches, Batthy\u00e1ny quickly formed the [[Hungarian Revolutionary Army]]. The new Hungarian army defeated the Croatians on 29 September at the [[Battle of P\u00e1kozd]].\n\nThe battle became an icon for the Hungarian army for its effect on politics and morale. Kossuth's second letter for the Austrian people and this battle were the causes of the second revolution in Vienna on 6 October.\n\nBatthy\u00e1ny slowly realized that he could not reach his main goal, peaceful compromise with the Habsburg dynasty. On 2 October he resigned and simultaneously resigned his seat in parliament.  The ministers of his cabinet also resigned on the same day.\n\n===The Austrian Stadion Constitution and the renewal of antagonism===\nThe Habsburg government in Vienna proclaimed a new constitution, the so-called [[Stadion Constitution]] on 4 March 1849.<ref>{{cite book | title= Diglossia and Power: Language Policies and Practice in the 19th Century Habsburg Empire | last= Schjerve | first= Rosita Rindler | year= 2003 | pages= 75\u201376 | series= Language, Power, and Social Process | volume= 9 | publisher= Walter de Gruyter | location= Berlin | isbn= 9783110176544 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JOTFCTYSjicC&pg=PA75 | ref= harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title= Francis Joseph I.: His Life and Times | last= Mahaffy | first= Robert Pentland | year= 1908 | page= [https://archive.org/details/francisjosephih00mahagoog/page/n55 39] | publisher= Duckworth | location= Covent Garden | url= https://archive.org/details/francisjosephih00mahagoog | ref= harv}}</ref> The centralist Stadion Constitution provided very strong power for the monarch, and marked the way of neo-absolutism.<ref>{{cite book |author=Walther Killy |title=Dictionary of German biography |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |volume=9: Schmidt-Theyer |year=2005 |page=237 |isbn=9783110966299 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0-hrRQvGV7sC&pg=PA237}}</ref> The new March Constitution of Austria was drafted by the [[Imperial Diet (Austria)|Imperial Diet of Austria]], where Hungary had no representation.

The direction of the whole government was in his hands. Without military experience, he had to control and direct the movements of armies; he was unable to keep control over the generals or to establish that military co-operation so essential to success. Arthur G\u00f6rgey in particular, whose abilities Kossuth was the first to recognize, refused obedience; the two men were very different personalities. Twice Kossuth deposed him from the command; twice he had to restore him. It would have been well if Kossuth had had something more of G\u00f6rgey's calculated ruthlessness, for, as has been truly said, the revolutionary power he had seized could only be held by revolutionary means; but he was by nature soft-hearted and always merciful; though often audacious, he lacked decision in dealing with men. It has been said that he showed a want of personal courage; this is not improbable, the excess of feeling which made him so great an orator could hardly be combined with the coolness in danger required of a soldier; but no one was able, as he was, to infuse courage into others.\n\nDuring all the terrible winter which followed, his energy and spirit never failed him. It was he who overcame the reluctance of the army to march to the relief of Vienna; after the defeat at the Battle of Schwechat, at which he was present, he sent J\u00f3zef Bem to carry on the war in Transylvania. At the end of the year, when the Austrians were approaching Pest, he asked for the mediation of Mr [[William Henry Stiles]] (1808\u20131865), the American envoy. Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz, however, refused all terms, and the Diet and government fled to Debrecen, Kossuth taking with him the Crown of St Stephen, the sacred emblem of the Hungarian nation. In November 1848, Emperor Ferdinand abdicated in favour of Franz Joseph. The new Emperor revoked all the concessions granted in March and outlawed Kossuth and the Hungarian government \u2013 set up lawfully on the basis of the April laws. In April 1849, when the Hungarians had won many successes, after sounding the army, Kossuth issued the celebrated Hungarian Declaration of Independence, in which he declared that \"the house of Habsburg-Lorraine, perjured in the sight of God and man, had forfeited the Hungarian throne.\" It was a step characteristic of his love for extreme and dramatic action, but it added to the dissensions between him and those who wished only for autonomy under the old dynasty, and his enemies did not scruple to accuse him of aiming for Kingship. The dethronement also made any compromise with the Habsburgs practically impossible.\n\nKossuth played a key role in tying down the Hungarian army for weeks for the siege and recapture of Buda castle, finally successful on 21 May 1849.

In 1804 the semi-independent [[Principality of Serbia]] had formed south of the Danube with Belgrade as its capital. So in 1849, the Danube divided Serbia from the Kingdom of Hungary. The Hungarian district on the northern side of the river was called \"[[Vojvodina]]\", and by that time it was home to almost half a million Serbian inhabitants. According to the [[Demographic history of Vojvodina#1840|census of 1840 in Vojvodina]] Serbs comprised 49% of the total population. The Serbs of Vojvodina had sought their independence or attachment with the [[Principality of Serbia]] on the other side of the Danube. In face of the emerging Hungarian independence movement leading up to the 1848 Revolution the Austrian monarchy had promised an independent status for the Serbs of Vojvodina within the Austrian Empire.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nToward this end, [[Josif Raja\u010di\u0107]] was appointed Patriarch of Vojvodina in February 1849.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=613}}  Raja\u010di\u0107 was a supporter of the Serbian national movement, although somewhat conservative with pro-Austrian leanings. At a crucial point during the war against the Hungarian Government, in late March 1849 when the Austrians needed more Serbian soldiers to fight the war, the Austrian General [[Georg Rukavina Baron von Vidovgrad]], who commanded the Austrian troops in Hungary, officially re-stated this promise of independence for Vojvodina and conceded to all the demands of the Patriarch regarding Serbian nationhood.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=250|loc=The War in Hungary}}  Acquiescence to the demands of the Patriarch should have meant a relaxation of the strict military administration of Vojvodina. Under this military administration in the border areas, any male between the ages of 16 years and 60 years of age could be conscripted into the army.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|loc=8 April 1848}}\n\nThe Serbs of Vojvodina were expecting their requirement for Austrian military conscription to be the first measure to be relaxed. But the new Emperor Franz Joseph had other ideas and this promise was broken not more than two weeks after it had been made to the people of Vojvodina. This caused a split in the population of the Vojvodina and at least part of the Serbs in that province began to support the elected Hungarian Government against the Austrians{{sfn|Marx|Engels|loc=8 April 1848}}. Some Serbs sought to ingratiate the Serb nation with the Austrian Empire to promote the independence of Vojvodina.\n\nWith war on three fronts the Hungarian Government should have been squashed immediately{{According to whom|date=January 2014}} upon the start of hostilities. However, events early in the war worked in favor of the Government. The unity of the Serbs on the southern front was ruined by Austrian perfidy over the legal status of Vojvodina.\n\nSome right-wing participants in the Serbian national movement felt that a \"revolution\" in Hungary more threatened the prerogatives of landowners, and the nobles in Serbian Vojvodina, than the occupying Austrians.{{sfn|Judah|1997|p=60}}\n\n[[File:Than tapiobicskei utk\u00f6zet2 1849 aprilis 4.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Battle at [[T\u00e1pi\u00f3bicske]] (4 April 1849) by [[M\u00f3r Than]]]]\nAt the start of the war, the Hungarian Defence Forces (''[[Royal Hungarian Landwehr|Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g]]'') won some {{Quantify|date=January 2014}} battles<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.hu/museum/index_en.php?ID=331|title=P\u00e1kozd-Sukor\u00f3 Battle 1848 Exhibition|language=Hungarian |accessdate=28 June 2011 |location=P\u00e1kozd |date=September 29, 1998 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728185918/http://www.museum.hu/museum/index_en.php?ID=331|archivedate=28 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1hungary.com/info/isaszeg/ |title=Isaszeg |work=1hungary.com |accessdate=2 July 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707061715/http://www.1hungary.com/info/isaszeg/ |archivedate=7 July 2011 }}</ref> against the Austrians, for example at the [[Battle of P\u00e1kozd]] in September 1848 and at the [[Battle of Isaszeg (1849)|Isaszeg]] in April 1849, at which time they even stated the [[Hungarian Declaration of Independence]] from the Habsburg Empire.

However, in the years leading up to the revolution, the Hungarians had taken steps to [[Magyarization|Magyarize]] the Slovak region under Hungarian control. The aim of this was to bring the varied ethnic groups around Hungary into a common culture. At the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution this process was seen as more imminent and threatening to ethnic groups, especially the Slovaks.<ref name=slovak>\u0160piesz, Anton (2006), Illustrated Slovak History, Wauconda, Illinois: Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, {{ISBN|0-86516-500-9}}</ref>\n\nThe Slovaks made demands that their culture be spared Magyarization and that they be given certain liberties and rights. These demands soon broke out into demonstrations clamouring for the rights of ethnic minorities in Hungary. Arrests were made that further enraged the demonstrators and eventually a Pan-Slavic Congress was held in Prague. A document was drafted at this congress and sent to the Hungarian government demanding the rights of the Slovak people. The Hungarians responded by imposing martial law on the Slovak region.<ref name=slovak/>\n\nThe Imperial government recognized that all across the Empire, ethnic minorities were seeking more autonomy, but it was only Hungary that desired a complete break. They used this by supporting the ethnic national movements against the Hungarian government. Slovak volunteer units were commissioned in Vienna to join campaigns against the Hungarians across the theatre. A Slovak regiment then marched to Myjava{{Clarify|reason = spelling mistake?|date=January 2016}} where a Slovak council openly seceded from Hungary.

Slovak leaders hoped, that [[Upper Hungary]] would became part of Austrian part of the empire. Tensions with the Austrians soon began to rise. Lacking support and with increased Hungarian efforts, the Slovak volunteer corps had little impact for the rest of the war until the Russians marched in. It was used in 'mopping up' resistance in the wake of the Russian advance and then soon after was disbanded, ending Slovak involvement in the Revolution.

After all appeals to other European states failed, Kossuth abdicated on August 11, 1849 in favour of [[Art\u00far G\u00f6rgey]], who he thought was the only general who was capable of saving the nation.\n\nHowever, in May 1849, Tsar Nicholas I pledged to redouble his efforts against the Hungarian Government. He and Emperor Franz Joseph started to regather and rearm an army to be commanded by [[Anton Vogl]], the Austrian lieutenant-field-marshal who had actively participated in the suppression of the national liberation movement in Galicia in 1848.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=618}} But even at this stage Vogl was occupied trying to stop another revolutionary uprising in Galicia.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=303}} The Tsar was also preparing to send 30,000 Russian soldiers back over the Eastern Carpathian Mountains from Poland. Austria held Galicia and moved into Hungary, independent of Vogl's forces.

Being one of the most determinative events in Hungary's modern history, it is also one of the cornerstones of the Hungarian national identity. The crucial turning point of the events were the [[April laws]] which was ratified by King [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]], however the new young Austrian monarch [[Franz Joseph I]] arbitrarily revoked the laws without any legal competence. This unconstitutional act irreversibly escalated the conflict between the Hungarian parliament and Franz Joseph. The new constrained [[Stadion Constitution]] of Austria, the revocation of the April laws and the Austrian military campaign against the Kingdom of Hungary resulted in the fall of the pacifist [[Lajos Batthy\u00e1ny|Batthy\u00e1ny government]] (who searched agreement with the court) and led to the sudden emergence of [[Lajos Kossuth]]'s followers in the parliament, who demanded the full independence of Hungary. The Austrian military intervention in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] resulted in strong anti-Habsburg sentiment among Hungarians, thus the events in Hungary grew into a war for total [[independence]] from the [[Habsburg dynasty]].\n\nAfter a series of serious Austrian defeats in 1849, the Austrian Empire came close to the brink of collapse. The young emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] had to call for Russian help in the name of the [[Holy Alliance]].<ref>Eric Roman: Austria-Hungary & the Successor States: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present -PAGE: 67, Publisher: Infobase Publishing, 2003 {{ISBN|9780816074693}}</ref> Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] answered, and sent a 200,000 strong army with 80,000 auxiliary forces. Finally, the joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian forces.

[[Ign\u00e1c Martinovics]] worked as a secret agent for the new Holy Roman Emperor, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], until 1792. In his Oratio pro Leopoldo II, he explicitly declares that only authority derived from a [[social contract]] should be recognized; he saw the aristocracy as the enemy of mankind, because they prevented people from becoming educated. In another of his works, Catechism of People and Citizens, he argued that citizens tend to oppose any repression and that sovereignty resides with the people. He also became a Freemason, and was in favour of the adoption of a federal republic in Hungary. As a member of the Hungarian Jacobins, he was considered an idealistic forerunner of revolutionary thought by some, and an unscrupulous adventurer by others. He was in charge of stirring up a revolt against the nobility among the Hungarian serfs. For these subversive acts, Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, dismissed Martinovics and his boss, Ferenc Gotthardi, the former chief of the secret police. He was executed, together with six other prominent Jacobins, in May 1795.

In the latter years of Francis I the dark shadow of Metternich's policy of \"stability\" fell across the kingdom, and the forces of reactionary absolutism were everywhere supreme. But beneath the surface a strong popular current was beginning to run in a contrary direction. Hungarian society, affected by western Liberalism, but without any direct help from abroad, was preparing for the future emancipation. Writers, savants, poets, artists, noble and plebeian, layman and cleric, without any previous concert, or obvious connection, were working towards that ideal of political liberty which was to unite all the Magyars. Mih\u00e1ly V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty, Ferenc K\u00f6lcsey, Ferencz Kazinczy and his associates, to mention but a few of many great names, were, consciously or unconsciously, as the representatives of the renascent national literature, accomplishing a political mission, and their pens proved no less efficacious than the swords of their ancestors.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn 1825 [[Emperor Francis II]] convened the Diet in response to growing concerns amongst the Hungarian nobility about taxes and the diminishing economy, after the Napoleonic wars. This \u2013 and the reaction to the reforms of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor#Ruling emperor<!-- see sub-chapter \"Reaction\" as well -->|Joseph II]] \u2013 started what is known as the Reform Period ({{lang-hu|reformkor}}).{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} But the Nobles still retained their privileges of paying no taxes and not giving the vote to the masses.\n\nThe influential Hungarian politician Count [[Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi]] recognized the need to bring the country the advances of the more developed West European countries, such as England.\n\nIt was a direct attack upon the constitution which, to use the words of Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi, first \"startled the nation out of its sickly drowsiness\". In 1823, when the reactionary powers were considering joint action to suppress the revolution in Spain, the government, without consulting the diet, imposed a war-tax and called out the recruits. The county assemblies instantly protested against this illegal act, and Francis I was obliged, at the diet of 1823, to repudiate the action of his ministers. But the estates felt that the maintenance of their liberties demanded more substantial guarantees than the dead letter of ancient laws. Sz\u00e9chenyi, who had resided abroad and studied Western institutions, was the recognized leader of all those who wished to create a new Hungary out of the old. For years he and his friends educated public opinion by issuing innumerable pamphlets in which the new Liberalism was eloquently expounded. In particular Sz\u00e9chenyi insisted that the people must not look exclusively to the government, or even to the diet, for the necessary reforms. Society itself must take the initiative by breaking down the barriers of class exclusiveness and reviving a healthy public spirit. The effect of this teaching was manifest at the diet of 1832, when the Liberals in the Lower Chamber had a large majority, prominent among whom were Ferenc De\u00e1k and \u00d6d\u00f6n Beothy. In the Upper House, however, the magnates united with the government to form a conservative party obstinately opposed to any project of reform, which frustrated all the efforts of the Liberals.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe new rising political star of the mid 1830s was [[Lajos Kossuth]], who started to rival with the popularity of Sz\u00e9chenyi due to his talent as orator in the liberal fraction of the parliament. Kossuth called for broader parliamentary democracy, rapid industrialization, general taxation, economic expansion through exports, and the abolition of serfdom and aristocratic privileges (equality before the law). The alarm of the government at the power and popularity of the Liberal party induced it, soon after the accession of the new king, the emperor Ferdinand I (1835\u20131848), to attempt to crush the reform movement by arresting and imprisoning the most active agitators among them, Lajos Kossuth and [[Mikl\u00f3s Wessel\u00e9nyi]]. But the nation was no longer to be cowed. The diet of 1839 refused to proceed to business till the political prisoners had been released, and, while in the Lower Chamber the reforming majority was larger than ever, a Liberal party was now also formed in the Upper House under the leadership of Count Louis Batthy\u00e1ny and Baron Joseph Eotvos. From 1000AD up to 1844, Latin language was the official language of administration, legislation and schooling in the Kingdom of Hungary.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Two progressive measures of the highest importance were passed by this diet, one making Magyar the official language of Hungary, the other freeing the peasants' holdings from all feudal obligations.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe results of the diet of 1839 did not satisfy the advanced Liberals, while the opposition of the government and of the Upper House still further embittered the general discontent. The chief exponent of this temper was the Pesti Hirlap, Hungary's first political newspaper, founded in 1841 by Kossuth, whose articles, advocating armed reprisals if necessary, inflamed the extremists but alienated Sz\u00e9chenyi, who openly attacked Kossuth's opinions. The polemic on both sides was violent; but, as usual, the extreme views prevailed, and on the assembling of the diet of 1843 Kossuth was more popular than ever, while the influence of Sz\u00e9chenyi had sensibly declined. The tone of this diet was passionate, and the government was fiercely attacked for interfering with the elections. A new party called as [[Opposition Party (Hungary)|Opposition party]] was created, which united the reform oriented Liberals, to oppose the conservatives. Fresh triumphs were won by the Liberals (the Opposition Party). Magyar was now declared to be the language of the schools and the law-courts as well as of the legislature; mixed marriages were legalized; and official positions were thrown open to non-nobles.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===\"Long debate\" of reformers in the press (1841\u20131848)===\nThe interval between the diet of 1843 and that of 1847 saw a complete disintegration and transformation of the various political parties. Sz\u00e9chenyi openly joined the government, while the moderate Liberals separated from the extremists and formed a new party, the Centralists. \n\n[[File:Pilvax Pest Preiszler.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The entrance room of the Pilvax coffee palace at [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] in the 1840s]]\n[[File:Pet\u0151fi Nemzeti M\u00fazeum.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The recitation of the National Song at the National Museum]]\n[[File:A szabadsajt\u00f3 els\u0151 term\u00e9ke Pesten 1848. m\u00e1rcius 15.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The crowd captured the Landerer & Heckenast printing house, where they printed the 12 points and the National Song.

Sz\u00e9chenyi believed that economic, political and social reforms should proceed slowly and with care, in order to avoid the potentially disastrous prospect of violent interference from the Habsburg dynasty. Sz\u00e9chenyi was aware of the spread of Kossuth's ideas in Hungarian society, which he took to overlook the need for a good relationship with the Habsburg dynasty.\n\nKossuth, for his part, rejected the role of the aristocracy, and questioned established norms of social status. In contrast to Sz\u00e9chenyi, Kossuth believed that in the process of social reform it would be impossible to restrain civil society in a passive role. He warned against attempting to exclude wider social movements from political life, and supported democracy, rejecting the primacy of elites and the government. In 1885, he labeled Sz\u00e9chenyi a liberal elitist aristocrat, while Sz\u00e9chenyi considered Kossuth to be a democrat.<ref>Mih\u00e1ly Lack\u00f3: ''Sz\u00e9chenyi \u00e9s Kossuth vit\u00e1ja'', Gondolat, 1977.</ref>\n\nSz\u00e9chenyi was an isolationist politician, while Kossuth saw strong relations and collaboration with international liberal and progressive movements as essential for the success of liberty.<ref>See: Lacko p. 47</ref>\n\nSz\u00e9chenyi based his economic policy on the ''[[laissez-faire]]'' principles practiced by the [[British Empire]], while Kossuth supported protective tariffs due to the comparatively weak Hungarian industrial sector. While Kossuth envisioned the construction of a rapidly industrialized country, Sz\u00e9chenyi wanted to preserve the traditionally strong agricultural sector as the main characteristic of the economy.<ref>''Gr\u00f3f Sz\u00e9chenyi Istv\u00e1n \u00edr\u00f3i \u00e9s h\u00edrlapi vit\u00e1ja Kossuth Lajossal'' [Count Stephen Sz\u00e9chenyi,s Literary and Publicistic Debate with Louis Kossuth], ed.

This was also the last election which was based on the parliamentary system of the old feudal estates. All efforts to bring about an understanding between the government and the opposition were fruitless. Kossuth demanded not merely the redress of actual grievances, but a liberal reform which would make grievances impossible in the future. In the highest circles a dissolution of the diet now seemed to be the sole remedy; but, before it could be carried out, tidings of the February revolution in Paris reached Pressburg on the 1st of March, and on the 3rd of March Kossuth's motion for the appointment of an independent, responsible ministry was accepted by the Lower House. The moderates, alarmed not so much by the motion itself as by its tone, again tried to intervene; but on the 13th of March the Vienna revolution broke out, and the Emperor, yielding to pressure or panic, appointed Count Louis Batthy\u00e1ny premier of the first Hungarian responsible ministry, which included Kossuth, Sz\u00e9chenyi and De\u00e1k.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Hungary |volume=13 |pages=915\u2013918 |first1=Robert Nisbet |last1=Bain |first2=Walter Alison |last2=Phillips |inline=1}}</ref>\n\n==The bloodless revolution in Pest==\n{{further|12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848}}\n[[File:Magyar kok\u00e1rda.png|thumb|left|100px|The Hungarian [[cockade]] used in 1848]]\n\nThe crisis came from abroad - as Kossuth expected - and he used it to the full. On 3 March 1848, shortly after the news of the [[The Revolutions of 1848 in France|revolution in Paris]] had arrived, in a speech of surpassing power he demanded parliamentary government for Hungary and constitutional government for the rest of Austria. He appealed to the hope of the Habsburgs, \"our beloved Archduke [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]]\" (then seventeen years old), to perpetuate the ancient glory of the dynasty by meeting half-way the aspirations of a free people. He at once became the leader of the European revolution; his speech was read aloud in the streets of [[Vienna]] to the mob by which [[Metternich]] was overthrown (13 March), and when a deputation from the Diet visited Vienna to receive the assent of Emperor Ferdinand to their petition it was Kossuth who received the chief ovation. The arrival of the news of the revolution in Paris, and Kossuth's German speech about freedom and human rights had whipped up the passions of Austrian crowd in Vienna on March 13.<ref>Charles Frederick Henningsen: Kossuth and 'The Times', by the author of 'The revelations of Russia'. 1851 -PAGE: 10</ref>\nWhile Viennese masses celebrated Kossuth as their hero, revolution broke out in Buda on 15 March; Kossuth traveled home immediately.<ref>Peter F.

On the morning of March 15, 1848, revolutionaries marched around the city of Pest, reading [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]]'s [[Nemzeti dal]] (National Song) and the [[12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848|12 points]] (the twelve demands of theirs) to the crowd (which swelled to thousands). Declaring an end to all forms of censorship, they visited the printing presses of Landerer and Heckenast and printed Pet\u0151fi's poem together with the demands. A mass demonstration was held in front of the newly built National Museum, after which the group left for the Buda Chancellery (the Office of the Governor-General) on the other bank of the Danube.\n\nThe bloodless mass demonstrations in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] and [[Buda]] forced the Imperial governor to accept all twelve of their demands.\n\nAustria had its own problems with the [[Vienna Revolt|revolution in Vienna]] that year, and it initially acknowledged Hungary's government. Therefore, the Governor-General's officers, acting in the name of the King appointed Hungary's new parliament with [[Lajos Batthy\u00e1ny]] as its first Prime Minister. The Austrian monarchy also made other concessions{{Which|date=July 2011}} to subdue the Vienna masses: on 13 March 1848, Prince [[Klemens von Metternich]] was made to resign his position as the Austrian Government's Chancellor.

The reform oriented political forces won the elections. The electoral system and franchise were similar to the contemporary British system.<ref>Steven A. Seidman and Peter Lang. ''Posters, Propaganda, and Persuasion in Election Campaigns Around the World''. p. 201</ref>\n\nAt that time the internal affairs and foreign policy of Hungary were not stable, and Batthy\u00e1ny faced many problems. His first and most important act was to organize the armed forces and the local governments. He insisted that the Austrian army, when in Hungary, would come under Hungarian law, and this was conceded by the Austrian Empire. He tried to repatriate conscript soldiers from Hungary. He established the [[Organisation of Militiamen]], whose job was to ensure internal security of the country.\n\nBatthy\u00e1ny was a very capable leader, but he was stuck in the middle of a clash between the Austrian monarchy and the Hungarian separatists. He was devoted to the [[constitutional monarchy]] and aimed to keep the constitution, but the Emperor was dissatisfied with his work. \n\n[[Josip Jela\u010di\u0107]] was [[Ban of Croatia|''Ban'' (Viceroy) of Croatia and Dalmatia]], regions included in the Kingdom of Hungary. He was opposed to the new Hungarian government, and raised troops in his domains.\n\nIn the summer of 1848, the Hungarian government, seeing the civil war ahead, tried to get the Habsburgs' support against Jela\u010di\u0107. They offered to send troops to northern Italy. In August 1848, the Imperial Government in Vienna officially ordered the Hungarian government in Pest not to form an army.\n\nOn 29 August, with the assent of parliament, Batthy\u00e1ny  went with [[Ferenc De\u00e1k]] to the Emperor to ask him to order the Serbs to capitulate and stop Jela\u010di\u0107, who was going to attack Hungary. But Jela\u010di\u0107 went ahead and invaded Hungary to dissolve the Hungarian government, without any order from Austria.\n\nThough the Emperor formally relieved Jela\u010di\u0107 of his duties, Jela\u010di\u0107 and his army invaded [[Me\u0111imurje (region)|Murak\u00f6z (Me\u0111imurje)]] and the Southern [[Transdanubia]]n parts of Hungary on 11 September 1848.\n\nAfter the Austrian revolution in Vienna was defeated, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] replaced his uncle [[Ferdinand I of Austria]], who was not of sound mind. Franz Joseph didn't recognise Batthy\u00e1ny's second premiership, which began on 25 September. Also, Franz Joseph was not recognized as \"King of Hungary\" by the Hungarian parliament, and he was not crowned as \"King of Hungary\" until 1867. In the end, the final break between Vienna and Pest occurred when Field-Marshal [[Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg]] was given control of every army in Hungary (including Jela\u010di\u0107's). He went to Hungary where he was mobbed and viciously murdered. Following his murder the Imperial court dissolved the Hungarian Diet and appointed Jela\u010di\u0107 as Regent.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nMeanwhile, Batthy\u00e1ny travelled again to Vienna to seek a compromise with the new Emperor. His efforts remained unsuccessful, because Franz Joseph refused to accept the reform laws. This was an unconstitutional deed, because the laws were already signed by his uncle, and the monarch had no right to revoke laws which were already signed.\n\nHungarian liberals in Pest saw this as an opportunity. In September 1848, the Diet made concessions to the Pest Uprising, so as not to break up the Austro-Hungarian Union. But the counter-revolutionary forces were gathering. After many{{Quantify|date=January 2014}} local victories, the combined Bohemian and Croatian armies entered Pest on 5 January 1849.<ref>{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Gazi |title=A History of Croatia |publisher=Barnes and Noble Books |place=New York |year=1973 |page=150}}</ref>\n\nSo Batthy\u00e1ny and his government resigned, except for Kossuth, Szemere, and M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros. Later, on [[Archduke Stephen, Palatine of Hungary|Palatine Stephen]]'s request, Batthy\u00e1ny became Prime Minister again. On 13 September Batthy\u00e1ny announced a rebellion and requested that the Palatine lead them. However the Palatine, under the Emperor's orders, resigned and left Hungary.\n\nHungary now had war raging on three fronts: Jela\u010di\u0107's [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatian]] troops to the South, [[Hungarians in Romania|Romanians]] in [[Banat]] and in [[Transylvania]] to the East, and Austria to the west.\n\nThe Hungarian government was in serious military crisis due to the lack of soldiers, therefore they sent Kossuth (a brilliant orator) to recruit volunteers for the new Hungarian army. While Jela\u010di\u0107 was marching on Pest, Kossuth went from town to town rousing the people to the defense of the country, and the popular force of the Honv\u00e9d was his creation.\n\nWith the help of Kossuth's recruiting speeches, Batthy\u00e1ny quickly formed the [[Hungarian Revolutionary Army]]. The new Hungarian army defeated the Croatians on 29 September at the [[Battle of P\u00e1kozd]].\n\nThe battle became an icon for the Hungarian army for its effect on politics and morale. Kossuth's second letter for the Austrian people and this battle were the causes of the second revolution in Vienna on 6 October.\n\nBatthy\u00e1ny slowly realized that he could not reach his main goal, peaceful compromise with the Habsburg dynasty. On 2 October he resigned and simultaneously resigned his seat in parliament.

The direction of the whole government was in his hands. Without military experience, he had to control and direct the movements of armies; he was unable to keep control over the generals or to establish that military co-operation so essential to success. Arthur G\u00f6rgey in particular, whose abilities Kossuth was the first to recognize, refused obedience; the two men were very different personalities. Twice Kossuth deposed him from the command; twice he had to restore him. It would have been well if Kossuth had had something more of G\u00f6rgey's calculated ruthlessness, for, as has been truly said, the revolutionary power he had seized could only be held by revolutionary means; but he was by nature soft-hearted and always merciful; though often audacious, he lacked decision in dealing with men. It has been said that he showed a want of personal courage; this is not improbable, the excess of feeling which made him so great an orator could hardly be combined with the coolness in danger required of a soldier; but no one was able, as he was, to infuse courage into others.\n\nDuring all the terrible winter which followed, his energy and spirit never failed him. It was he who overcame the reluctance of the army to march to the relief of Vienna; after the defeat at the Battle of Schwechat, at which he was present, he sent J\u00f3zef Bem to carry on the war in Transylvania. At the end of the year, when the Austrians were approaching Pest, he asked for the mediation of Mr [[William Henry Stiles]] (1808\u20131865), the American envoy. Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz, however, refused all terms, and the Diet and government fled to Debrecen, Kossuth taking with him the Crown of St Stephen, the sacred emblem of the Hungarian nation. In November 1848, Emperor Ferdinand abdicated in favour of Franz Joseph. The new Emperor revoked all the concessions granted in March and outlawed Kossuth and the Hungarian government \u2013 set up lawfully on the basis of the April laws. In April 1849, when the Hungarians had won many successes, after sounding the army, Kossuth issued the celebrated Hungarian Declaration of Independence, in which he declared that \"the house of Habsburg-Lorraine, perjured in the sight of God and man, had forfeited the Hungarian throne.\" It was a step characteristic of his love for extreme and dramatic action, but it added to the dissensions between him and those who wished only for autonomy under the old dynasty, and his enemies did not scruple to accuse him of aiming for Kingship. The dethronement also made any compromise with the Habsburgs practically impossible.\n\nKossuth played a key role in tying down the Hungarian army for weeks for the siege and recapture of Buda castle, finally successful on 21 May 1849. The hopes of ultimate success were, however, frustrated by the intervention of Russia; all appeals to the western powers were vain, and on 11 August Kossuth abdicated in favor of G\u00f6rgey, on the ground that in the last extremity the general alone could save the nation. G\u00f6rgey capitulated at Vil\u00e1gos (now \u015eiria, Romania) to the Russians, who handed over the army to the Austrians.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==War of Independence==\n[[File:Buda ostroma 1849. m\u00e1jus 21.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Siege of Buda (1849)|Siege of Buda]] in May 1849]]\nIn 1848 and 1849, the [[Hungarian people]] or Magyars, who wanted independence, formed a majority only in the central areas of the country.

In 1804 the semi-independent [[Principality of Serbia]] had formed south of the Danube with Belgrade as its capital. So in 1849, the Danube divided Serbia from the Kingdom of Hungary. The Hungarian district on the northern side of the river was called \"[[Vojvodina]]\", and by that time it was home to almost half a million Serbian inhabitants. According to the [[Demographic history of Vojvodina#1840|census of 1840 in Vojvodina]] Serbs comprised 49% of the total population. The Serbs of Vojvodina had sought their independence or attachment with the [[Principality of Serbia]] on the other side of the Danube. In face of the emerging Hungarian independence movement leading up to the 1848 Revolution the Austrian monarchy had promised an independent status for the Serbs of Vojvodina within the Austrian Empire.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nToward this end, [[Josif Raja\u010di\u0107]] was appointed Patriarch of Vojvodina in February 1849.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=613}}  Raja\u010di\u0107 was a supporter of the Serbian national movement, although somewhat conservative with pro-Austrian leanings. At a crucial point during the war against the Hungarian Government, in late March 1849 when the Austrians needed more Serbian soldiers to fight the war, the Austrian General [[Georg Rukavina Baron von Vidovgrad]], who commanded the Austrian troops in Hungary, officially re-stated this promise of independence for Vojvodina and conceded to all the demands of the Patriarch regarding Serbian nationhood.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=250|loc=The War in Hungary}}  Acquiescence to the demands of the Patriarch should have meant a relaxation of the strict military administration of Vojvodina. Under this military administration in the border areas, any male between the ages of 16 years and 60 years of age could be conscripted into the army.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|loc=8 April 1848}}\n\nThe Serbs of Vojvodina were expecting their requirement for Austrian military conscription to be the first measure to be relaxed. But the new Emperor Franz Joseph had other ideas and this promise was broken not more than two weeks after it had been made to the people of Vojvodina. This caused a split in the population of the Vojvodina and at least part of the Serbs in that province began to support the elected Hungarian Government against the Austrians{{sfn|Marx|Engels|loc=8 April 1848}}. Some Serbs sought to ingratiate the Serb nation with the Austrian Empire to promote the independence of Vojvodina.\n\nWith war on three fronts the Hungarian Government should have been squashed immediately{{According to whom|date=January 2014}} upon the start of hostilities. However, events early in the war worked in favor of the Government. The unity of the Serbs on the southern front was ruined by Austrian perfidy over the legal status of Vojvodina.\n\nSome right-wing participants in the Serbian national movement felt that a \"revolution\" in Hungary more threatened the prerogatives of landowners, and the nobles in Serbian Vojvodina, than the occupying Austrians.{{sfn|Judah|1997|p=60}}\n\n[[File:Than tapiobicskei utk\u00f6zet2 1849 aprilis 4.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Battle at [[T\u00e1pi\u00f3bicske]] (4 April 1849) by [[M\u00f3r Than]]]]\nAt the start of the war, the Hungarian Defence Forces (''[[Royal Hungarian Landwehr|Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g]]'') won some {{Quantify|date=January 2014}} battles<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.hu/museum/index_en.php?ID=331|title=P\u00e1kozd-Sukor\u00f3 Battle 1848 Exhibition|language=Hungarian |accessdate=28 June 2011 |location=P\u00e1kozd |date=September 29, 1998 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728185918/http://www.museum.hu/museum/index_en.php?ID=331|archivedate=28 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1hungary.com/info/isaszeg/ |title=Isaszeg |work=1hungary.com |accessdate=2 July 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707061715/http://www.1hungary.com/info/isaszeg/ |archivedate=7 July 2011 }}</ref> against the Austrians, for example at the [[Battle of P\u00e1kozd]] in September 1848 and at the [[Battle of Isaszeg (1849)|Isaszeg]] in April 1849, at which time they even stated the [[Hungarian Declaration of Independence]] from the Habsburg Empire.

However, in the years leading up to the revolution, the Hungarians had taken steps to [[Magyarization|Magyarize]] the Slovak region under Hungarian control. The aim of this was to bring the varied ethnic groups around Hungary into a common culture. At the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution this process was seen as more imminent and threatening to ethnic groups, especially the Slovaks.<ref name=slovak>\u0160piesz, Anton (2006), Illustrated Slovak History, Wauconda, Illinois: Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, {{ISBN|0-86516-500-9}}</ref>\n\nThe Slovaks made demands that their culture be spared Magyarization and that they be given certain liberties and rights. These demands soon broke out into demonstrations clamouring for the rights of ethnic minorities in Hungary. Arrests were made that further enraged the demonstrators and eventually a Pan-Slavic Congress was held in Prague. A document was drafted at this congress and sent to the Hungarian government demanding the rights of the Slovak people.

However, the Austrian army was able to quell the rebellion. At the same time, at Schwechat, the Austrians defeated a Hungarian attempt to capture Vienna. After this victory, General [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz|Windischgr\u00e4tz]] and 70,000 troops were sent to Hungary to crush the Hungarian revolution. the Austrians followed the Danube down from Vienna and crossed over into Hungary to envelope Komorn (now [[Kom\u00e1rom]], Hungary and [[Kom\u00e1rno]], Slovakia). They continued down the Danube to Pest, the capital of the [[Hungarian Kingdom]]. After some fierce fighting, the Austrians, led by [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz]], captured Buda and Pest.{{sfn|Marx|Engels||p=343}}  (the town was known in German as Ofen and later Buda and Pest were united into [[Budapest]]).\n\nIn April 1849, after these defeats, the Hungarian Government recovered and scored several victories on this western front.

But there was a third front&nbsp;\u2013 the southern front in the Banat, fighting the troops of the Serbian national movement and the Croatian troops of Jela\u010di\u0107 within the province of Vojvodina itself. [[M\u00f3r Perczel]], the General of the Hungarian forces in the Banat, was initially successful in battles along the southern front.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=331}}\n\nIn April 1849, [[Ludwig von Welden|Ludwig Baron von Welden]] replaced Windischgr\u00e4tz as the new supreme commander of Austrian forces in Hungary.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|loc=19 April 1849|p=293}} Instead of pursuing the Austrian army, the Hungarians stopped to retake the Fort of Buda and prepared defenses. At the same time, however, victory in Italy had freed many Austrian troops which had hitherto been fighting on this front. In June 1849 Russian and Austrian troops entered Hungary heavily outnumbering the Hungarian army. After all appeals to other European states failed, Kossuth abdicated on August 11, 1849 in favour of [[Art\u00far G\u00f6rgey]], who he thought was the only general who was capable of saving the nation.\n\nHowever, in May 1849, Tsar Nicholas I pledged to redouble his efforts against the Hungarian Government. He and Emperor Franz Joseph started to regather and rearm an army to be commanded by [[Anton Vogl]], the Austrian lieutenant-field-marshal who had actively participated in the suppression of the national liberation movement in Galicia in 1848.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=618}} But even at this stage Vogl was occupied trying to stop another revolutionary uprising in Galicia.{{sfn|Marx|Engels|p=303}} The Tsar was also preparing to send 30,000 Russian soldiers back over the Eastern Carpathian Mountains from Poland.

It lies on the coast, to the south of the [[River Blyth, Northumberland|River Blyth]] and is approximately {{convert|13|mi}} northeast of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. It has a population of about 37,339.<ref name=\"NatStats\"/>\n\nThe port of Blyth dates from the 12th century, but the development of the modern town only began in the first quarter of the 18th century.  The main industries which helped the town prosper were coal mining and [[shipbuilding]], with the salt trade, fishing and the railways also playing an important role.  These industries have largely vanished, but the port still thrives, shipping paper and pulp from [[Scandinavia]] for the newspaper industries of England and [[Scotland]].<ref name=\"Communities Blyth\"/>\n\nThe town was seriously affected when its principal industries went into decline, and it has undergone much regeneration since the early 1990s.  The Keel Row Shopping Centre, opened in 1991, brought major high street retailers to Blyth, and helped to revitalise the town centre. The market place has recently been re-developed, with the aim of attracting further investment to the town.\n\nThe Quayside has also seen much redevelopment and has been transformed into a peaceful open space, the centrepiece of which is a sculpture commemorating the industry which once thrived there. There were, on the opposite side of the river are the nine [[wind turbine]]s of the Blyth Harbour Wind Farm, which were constructed along the East Pier in 1992.  They were joined in 2000 by Blyth Offshore Wind Farm, which is composed of two turbines situated <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">{{convert|1|km}}</span> out to sea. Although the original nine turbines have now been demolished, there is one larger turbine on the North Blyth side with building work taking place on a second turbine.\n\nBlyth is also home to the non-League football club [[Blyth Spartans A.F.C.|Blyth Spartans]], famed for their 1978 \"[[FA Cup#Giant-killers|giant-killing]]\" feats in the [[FA Cup]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe place-name Blyth is first attested in 1130 as ''Blida'', and takes its name from the river [[River Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]]. The river-name comes from the [[Old English]] adjective ''bl\u012b\u00f0e'' meaning 'gentle' or 'merry', and still used today. The town of Blyth is referred to as ''Blithmuth'' in 1236 and ''Blithemuth'' in 1250.

Coal exports started from the 14th century, with local mines recorded from the 16th century. In 1609 21,571 tons of coal were shipped from Blyth. The first large [[quay]] \u2013 Bishop's Quay, which still exists today \u2013 was developed by 1682. But the port was not dredged at this time, necessitating the use of Northumbrian [[keel boat]]s to transfer the loads to ships moored offshore. By 1730 specific coaling and ballast quays existed, and by 1765 the ports facilities included a [[pilot house]] and [[lighthouse]], to facilitate the newly built first breakwater, North Dyke. The High Lighthouse came into operation soon afterwards, operating until July 1984.<ref name=PoB/>\n\nThe port expanded greatly in the 19th century, with the purchase of a steam tug in 1819, and the rebuilding of the breakwater in 1822. By this point, three ship building yards had also been established. The construction of the [[Blyth and Tyne Railway]] from 1849 allowed coal shipments to quickly expand, reaching 200,000 tons per annum. The Blyth Harbour and Dock Company was created in 1854, but with need for further expansion, it was replaced by a bill of parliament given [[Royal Assent]] on 19 June 1882, which constituted the current Blyth Harbour Commission. This allowed additional financing to be raised, for construction of the South Harbour.<ref name=PoB/>\n\nBy the 20th century, through connection via the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] which had leased large amounts of land throughout the port, Blyth had started the growth to become the Europe's largest coal export port, exporting 5.5M tonnes per year by the late 1930s. This was also supplemented by ship building, including the opening of a facility by [[Hughes Bolckow|Hughes, Bolckow and Co]] of [[Middlesbrough]].<ref name=PoB/> Large scale shipbuilding had begun in 1811, and after passing through various hands, in 1880 the first two iron ships were built at Blyth for the Russian Government.<ref name=BSCgraces>{{Cite web\n |url= http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/wiki/Blyth_Shipbuilding_and_Dry_Docks_Co\n |title=Blyth Shipbuilding and Dry Docks Co.\n |work=gracesguide.co.uk\n |accessdate=4 January 2011\n}}</ref> This led to the foundation of the [[Blyth Shipbuilding Company]] on 2 March 1883, building [[Freight liner (ship)|cargo liners]], [[Tramp trade|tramp steamers]] and [[Collier (ship type)|collier]]s.<ref name=BSCgraces/> With a cargo ship under construction, in 1914 she was purchased by the [[Admiralty]] and converted into the Navy's first [[seaplane carrier]] {{HMS|Ark Royal|1914|2}}.

However, with the closure Blyth's last ship builder in 1966, the port began a significant period of contraction. The employment slack was in part taken up by the construction of the coal-fired [[Blyth Power Station]], located on the northern bank. of the river. The A Station with 480&nbsp;[[Watt#Megawatt|megawatts]] (MW) of capacity first generated electricity in 1958, a year after the creation of the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]], and the B Station with a capacity of 1,250&nbsp;MW four years later. The power stations' four large chimneys were a landmark of the Northumberland skyline for over 40&nbsp;years; the A Station's two chimneys each stood at {{convert|140|m}}; the B Station's two chimneys were taller, at {{convert|170|m}} each. They were operated by the successors of the CEGB, including [[National Power]], following the [[privatisation]] of the UK's [[Electrical power industry|power industry]]. After their closure in 2001, the stations  were demolished over the course of two years, ending with the demolition of the stations' chimneys on 7 December 2003. The establishment of an [[Alcan]] aluminium smelting facility in the 1970s {{convert|5|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} north along the river slowed this decline, as did the import of paper from [[Finland]].<ref name=PoB/>\n\nIn 1997, The Port established Transped, the ports packing business.

It lies on the coast, to the south of the [[River Blyth, Northumberland|River Blyth]] and is approximately {{convert|13|mi}} northeast of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. It has a population of about 37,339.<ref name=\"NatStats\"/>\n\nThe port of Blyth dates from the 12th century, but the development of the modern town only began in the first quarter of the 18th century.  The main industries which helped the town prosper were coal mining and [[shipbuilding]], with the salt trade, fishing and the railways also playing an important role.  These industries have largely vanished, but the port still thrives, shipping paper and pulp from [[Scandinavia]] for the newspaper industries of England and [[Scotland]].<ref name=\"Communities Blyth\"/>\n\nThe town was seriously affected when its principal industries went into decline, and it has undergone much regeneration since the early 1990s.  The Keel Row Shopping Centre, opened in 1991, brought major high street retailers to Blyth, and helped to revitalise the town centre. The market place has recently been re-developed, with the aim of attracting further investment to the town.\n\nThe Quayside has also seen much redevelopment and has been transformed into a peaceful open space, the centrepiece of which is a sculpture commemorating the industry which once thrived there. There were, on the opposite side of the river are the nine [[wind turbine]]s of the Blyth Harbour Wind Farm, which were constructed along the East Pier in 1992.  They were joined in 2000 by Blyth Offshore Wind Farm, which is composed of two turbines situated <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">{{convert|1|km}}</span> out to sea. Although the original nine turbines have now been demolished, there is one larger turbine on the North Blyth side with building work taking place on a second turbine.\n\nBlyth is also home to the non-League football club [[Blyth Spartans A.F.C.|Blyth Spartans]], famed for their 1978 \"[[FA Cup#Giant-killers|giant-killing]]\" feats in the [[FA Cup]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe place-name Blyth is first attested in 1130 as ''Blida'', and takes its name from the river [[River Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]]. The river-name comes from the [[Old English]] adjective ''bl\u012b\u00f0e'' meaning 'gentle' or 'merry', and still used today. The town of Blyth is referred to as ''Blithmuth'' in 1236 and ''Blithemuth'' in 1250. Had this name persisted, the town would today be referred to as \"Blythmouth\", on the analogy of [[Tynemouth]] to the south.<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p.50.</ref>\n\nLittle is known of the early development of the Blyth area.  The oldest [[Archaeology|archaeological]] find is an [[antler]] hammer dating from the late [[Neolithic]] or early [[Bronze Age]] period, which was found at Newsham in 1979.<ref>{{cite web\n| title=Prehistoric Hammer (Blyth)\n| work=keystothepast.info\n| url=http://www.keystothepast.info/durhamcc/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=N11773\n| accessdate=6 May 2007\n| url-status=dead\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224112/http://www.keystothepast.info/durhamcc/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=N11773\n| archivedate=30 September 2007\n| df=dmy-all\n}}</ref>\nHuman skulls, a spearhead and a sword dating from the Bronze Age were found in the river in 1890,<ref>{{cite web\n| title=Bronze Age Objects (Blyth)\n| work=keystothepast.info\n| url=http://www.keystothepast.info/durhamcc/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=N12071\n| accessdate=6 May 2007\n| url-status=dead\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003450/http://www.keystothepast.info/durhamcc/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=N12071\n| archivedate=28 September 2007\n| df=dmy-all\n}}</ref> as well as a bronze axe which was found at South Beach in 1993,<ref>{{cite web\n| title=Bronze Age Axe (Blyth)\n| work=keystothepast.info\n| url=http://www.keystothepast.info/durhamcc/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=N11983\n| accessdate=6 May 2007\n| url-status=dead\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003246/http://www.keystothepast.info/durhamcc/K2P.nsf/K2PDetail?readform&PRN=N11983\n| archivedate=28 September 2007\n| df=dmy-all\n}}</ref> and a dagger found at Newsham.

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the tax was increased to provide funds for the military and, even though the tax was abolished in 1825, the industry went into terminal decline.  Having had fourteen [[Salt evaporation pond|salt pans]] at the beginning of the 18th century, exporting over 1,000&nbsp;tons of salt annually, Blyth's salt industry closed in 1876, with the destruction of the last salt pan.<ref name=\"Communities Blyth\"/>\n\n[[File:Blyth map c.1860.jpg|thumb|left|A map of Blyth, circa 1860: the old part of the town is to the right; the houses of Waterloo and Cowpen Quay are to the bottom-left and top-left respectively.

Coal exports started from the 14th century, with local mines recorded from the 16th century. In 1609 21,571 tons of coal were shipped from Blyth. The first large [[quay]] \u2013 Bishop's Quay, which still exists today \u2013 was developed by 1682. But the port was not dredged at this time, necessitating the use of Northumbrian [[keel boat]]s to transfer the loads to ships moored offshore. By 1730 specific coaling and ballast quays existed, and by 1765 the ports facilities included a [[pilot house]] and [[lighthouse]], to facilitate the newly built first breakwater, North Dyke. The High Lighthouse came into operation soon afterwards, operating until July 1984.<ref name=PoB/>\n\nThe port expanded greatly in the 19th century, with the purchase of a steam tug in 1819, and the rebuilding of the breakwater in 1822. By this point, three ship building yards had also been established. The construction of the [[Blyth and Tyne Railway]] from 1849 allowed coal shipments to quickly expand, reaching 200,000 tons per annum. The Blyth Harbour and Dock Company was created in 1854, but with need for further expansion, it was replaced by a bill of parliament given [[Royal Assent]] on 19 June 1882, which constituted the current Blyth Harbour Commission. This allowed additional financing to be raised, for construction of the South Harbour.<ref name=PoB/>\n\nBy the 20th century, through connection via the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] which had leased large amounts of land throughout the port, Blyth had started the growth to become the Europe's largest coal export port, exporting 5.5M tonnes per year by the late 1930s. This was also supplemented by ship building, including the opening of a facility by [[Hughes Bolckow|Hughes, Bolckow and Co]] of [[Middlesbrough]].<ref name=PoB/> Large scale shipbuilding had begun in 1811, and after passing through various hands, in 1880 the first two iron ships were built at Blyth for the Russian Government.<ref name=BSCgraces>{{Cite web\n |url= http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/wiki/Blyth_Shipbuilding_and_Dry_Docks_Co\n |title=Blyth Shipbuilding and Dry Docks Co.\n |work=gracesguide.co.uk\n |accessdate=4 January 2011\n}}</ref> This led to the foundation of the [[Blyth Shipbuilding Company]] on 2 March 1883, building [[Freight liner (ship)|cargo liners]], [[Tramp trade|tramp steamers]] and [[Collier (ship type)|collier]]s.<ref name=BSCgraces/> With a cargo ship under construction, in 1914 she was purchased by the [[Admiralty]] and converted into the Navy's first [[seaplane carrier]] {{HMS|Ark Royal|1914|2}}.

However, with the closure Blyth's last ship builder in 1966, the port began a significant period of contraction. The employment slack was in part taken up by the construction of the coal-fired [[Blyth Power Station]], located on the northern bank. of the river. The A Station with 480&nbsp;[[Watt#Megawatt|megawatts]] (MW) of capacity first generated electricity in 1958, a year after the creation of the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]], and the B Station with a capacity of 1,250&nbsp;MW four years later.

They were operated by the successors of the CEGB, including [[National Power]], following the [[privatisation]] of the UK's [[Electrical power industry|power industry]]. After their closure in 2001, the stations  were demolished over the course of two years, ending with the demolition of the stations' chimneys on 7 December 2003. The establishment of an [[Alcan]] aluminium smelting facility in the 1970s {{convert|5|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} north along the river slowed this decline, as did the import of paper from [[Finland]].<ref name=PoB/>\n\nIn 1997, The Port established Transped, the ports packing business.

She expressed her personal wish that the relationship would serve as an example of [[wikt:color blindness|color blindness]] for the world.<ref name=Interracial>{{cite news|last=McGee-Davis|first=Trina|title=TV Can Help World Erase Color Lines|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/22/entertainment/ca-10422|accessdate=2013-08-22|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=1999-02-22}}</ref> In 2015 she reprised the role in one episode for the sequel series ''[[Girl Meets World]]''.\n\n==Filmography==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|- align=\"center\"\n! colspan=4 style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Film\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Year\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Show\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Role\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Notes\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1996\n|''[[The Birdcage]]''\n|Chocolate\n|\n|-\n|''[[Daylight (1996 film)|Daylight]]''\n|LaTonya\n|\n|-\n|2002\n|''[[Friday After Next]]''\n|Cinnamon\n|Credited as Tekla Ruchi\n|-\n|2009\n|''Da' Booty Shop''\n|Yolanda Johnson\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2010\n|''Keepin' the Faith: Momma's Got a Boyfriend''\n|Writer\n|[[Direct-to-video]]\n|-\n|''Jessica Sinclaire Presents: Confessions of A Lonely Wife''\n|Writer/Producer\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=3|2016\n|''Confessions of Isabella''\n|Rosa\n|Direct-to-video<br/> Writer<br/> Director\n|-\n|''Sins of the Guilty''\n|Vanessa Johnson\n|Writer\n|-\n|''LAPD African Cops''\n|\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|''Detainment''\n|Writer/Director\n|Filming\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|- align=\"center\"\n! colspan=4 style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Television\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Year\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Show\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Role\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Notes\n|-\n|1992\n|''[[A Different World (TV series)|A Different World]]''\n|Gennifer\n|Season 5 episode 18: \"Kiss You Back\"\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1994\n|''[[Picket Fences]]''\n|Deborah\n|Season 3 episode 4: \"Enemy Lines\"\n|-\n|''[[The Sinbad Show]]''\n|Faith\n|2 episode\n|-\n|''[[Martin (TV series)|Martin]]''\n|Woman #2\n|Season 2 episode 22: \"Yours, Mine, and Ours\"\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1995\n|''[[The Parent 'Hood]]''\n|Ashley Houchins\n|Season 1 episode 7: \"IQ, UQ, We All Q \"\n|-\n|''[[Family Matters]]''\n|Josie\n|Season 6 episode 15: \"The Gun\"\n|-\n|1996\n|''[[Dinner and a Movie]]''\n|Herself/Hostess\n|1 episode\n|-\n|1997-2000\n|''[[Boy Meets World]]''\n|[[List of Boy Meets World characters#Angela Moore|Angela Moore]]\n|Recurring Role (season 5)<br>Main cast (seasons 6\u20137)<br>60 episodes\n|-\n|1999\n|''[[City Guys]]'' \n|Ashley\n|3 episodes\n|-\n|2000\n|''[[City of Angels (2000 TV series)|City of Angels]]''\n|Saidah\n|Season 1 episode 9: \"Assume the Position\"\n|-\n|2001\n|''Untitled Sisqo Project''\n|Lucy\n|TV Movie\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2002\n|''[[So Little Time]]''\n|Waitress\n|Episode 15: \"The New Guy\"\n|-\n|''[[The Hughleys]]''\n|Mia\n|Season 4 episode 22: \"It's a Girl: Part 2\"<br/>Credited as Tekla Ruchi\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2007\n|''[[All of Us]]''\n|Stacy\n|Season 4 episode 16: \"He's Got Game\"\n|-\n|''Business Class''\n|Flight Attendant\n|TV Movie\n|-\n|2010\n|''Pastor Jones: The Complete First Season''\n|Tanya Jones\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2015\n|''[[Girl Meets World]]''\n|[[List of Boy Meets World characters#Angela Moore|Angela Moore]]\n|Season 2 episode 8: \"Girl Meets Hurricane\"<br/>Reprised role from ''[[Boy Meets World]]''\n|-\n|''[[In the Cut (TV series)|In the Cut]]''\n|Kirsten\n|Season 1 episode 5: \"The Ball's in Your Court\"\n|}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{IMDb name|0005208|Trina McGee}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McGee, Trina}}\n[[Category:1969 births]]\n[[Category:American film actresses]]\n[[Category:American people of Haitian descent]]\n[[Category:African-American actresses]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American television actresses]]\n[[Category:People from the Bronx]]\n[[Category:Actresses from New York City]]\n", "name_user": "98.206.214.33", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eCareer)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trina_McGee"}

[[Silurian]] characterized by short, essentially straight shells referred to as breviconic, typically with a faintly exogastric shape produced by the profile of the body chamber. \n\nApertures vary from round to T-shaped, with a long narrow, ventral, hyponomic sinus for the maneuvering funnel. [[Siphuncle]]s are commonly central or subcentral with generally broad, expanded, segments and usually thin connecting rings.\n\nThe narrow hyponomic sinus, which is an opening for the water-jet funnel by which the animal could move, much as with modern [[squid]] and [[octopus|octopods]], points toward the lower or ventral side. The cross bar of the \"T\" or the round part of the aperture through which the animal could extend itself is located closer to the back or dorsal part of the shell.\n\n==Phylogeny==\nThe Mandaloceratidae are derived from the [[Reudemannoceratidae]] through ''Madiganella''. The earliest mandeloceratid is ''Pseudogomphoceras'' which gave rise to ''Ovocerina''.  ''Ovocerina'' gave rise to ''Cinctoceras'', ''Umbeloceras'', ''Verspoeras'', and Mandaloceras''. It also gave rise to the [[Mesoceratidae]] representing ''Mesoceras''.\n\n==Genera==\n\n'''''Mandaloceras''''' is the type genus of the Mandaloceratidae characterized by straight or somewhat curved shells with a slightly depressed cross section (width greater than height) and a constricted T-shaped aperture. The siphncle is subcentral and increases rapidly in width during the life of the animal. Segments are broad with thin connecting rings.\n\n'''''Cinctoceras''''' is a large mandaloceratid with a breviconic shell that tends to be dorsally flattened, making its cross section slightly  depressed; a constricted T-shape aperture and sphuncle segments that are short and broad.\n\n'''''Ovocerina''''' is a small breviconic mandaloceratid with an exogastric aspect produced by the more convenxly rounded lower (ventral) side and a rounded or transversely extended aperture that approaches the T-shaped aperture of ''Mandaloceras''.  The siphuncle is displaced slightly, either ventrally or dorsally from the center. Segments, composed of thin connecting rings, are broadly expanded.\n\n'''''Pseudogomphoceras''''' is a large, atypically longiconic mandeloceratid that reflects its reudemannoceratid ancestry.  The subcentral siphuncle contains vesicular deposits and a central tube. Otherwise it is like Ovoverina.\n\n'''''Umbelloceras''''' is a small breviconic mandaloceratid with a cross section ranging from slightly depressed to slightly compressed (width > height to width < height) and a T-shaped aperture in which the two lateral branches curve toward the venter.\n\n'''''Vesperoceras''''' is a medium size, generally straight, breviconic mandaloceratid with a broad annular expansion to the anterior part of the phragmocone followed by a constriction at the base of the body chamber. The siphuncle is located midway between the center and venter. Segments are moderately to strongly expanded. The aperture may be open or constricted.\n\n''Mandaloceras'' was named by Hyatt in Zittel 1900. The rest were named by Rousseau Flower, ''Ovocerina'' in 1947, ''Cinctoceras'', ''Pseudogomphoceras'', ''Umbelloceras'', and ''Vesperoceras'' in Flower and Teichert, 1957. With the exception of ''Mandaloceras'', which is also found in North America, the Mandeloceratidae are restricted to the Silurian of Europe.\n\n==References==\n*Flower, R.H. & Teichert, C. 1957.

Gaining [[Superman]]-like powers as a result of the meteorite, Bob initially tries to learn how to use his new powers alone, prompting media reports of a 'flying man', but later hands himself in after an incident involving him crashing into [[the Shard]]. Eventually trained by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in using his powers, Bob (now known as 'SuperBob') becomes the world's first [[superhero]], working for the MOD and the British Government as a '[[Civil service|civil servant]]'.\n\n6 years later, Bob's boss Theresa Ford authorizes the creation of a [[Documentary film|documentary]] to show the public that SuperBob is a 'normal guy', as SuperBob's popularity is mixed with common complaints including his simplistic personality and him needing the people he rescues to sign several forms for the MOD. Bob himself is still living in Peckham with his mandatory security guard Barry and his cleaner Dorris - who also works at the care home where Bob's mother lives and is trying to raise money to open a nursery in [[Colombia]]. Bob explains to the camera crew that he gets a day off from work every Tuesday and reveals that he's going out for his first date in 6 years with a [[librarian]] called June.\n\nWhile shopping for clothes with Dorris for his date, Bob receives an emergency call from Theresa telling him to come in for a meeting; arguing with Dorris after she points out he may miss his date with June. The meeting is a preparation for Bob to shake hands with [[United States|American]] [[Senate|senator]] Bill Jackson, who is in London for the MOD Weapons Summit and who sees SuperBob as a 'dangerous weapon that Britain doesn't have control over' (although this is mostly part of a [[smear campaign]] after America failed to poach Bob from the UK a year previously). However, after talking to June and following Dorris' advice, Bob finally stands up to Theresa and leaves to go on his date but is called away to the care home after his mother has an accident, with a misunderstanding causing Bob's mum (who has [[Amnesia|short-term memory loss]]) to think that he and Dorris are now dating.\n\nWanting to keep his mum happy, the pair share a tender dance together at a care home celebration with it being clear there are some romantic feelings between them. However, June rings and, after confirming that they weren't standing each other up, Bob arranges for the pair to have dinner together at his house. After he and Dorris leave the care home following an awkward conversation with one of Dorris' friends, Bob overhears reports of a multi-car pileup and goes to help but is scolded by Theresa at the scene for not following her orders and for being seen working on his day off. Despite this, he openly disobeys her after he provides comfort to a fatality injured woman before her death. Upon returning home, Dorris briefly provides comfort for Bob before leaving following June's arrival, with Bob and June having dinner together. Upon finding a note from Dorris regarding a problem he had earlier, however, Bob decides not to continue with the date as he openly reveals to June that he wants to be with Dorris.\n\nThe date is brought to a sudden stop when Bob and June are brought to the MOD for the Weapons Summit, with June revealing Theresa stopped her from going to lunch with him and that while June does like him, Theresa and the MOD want Bob to be with June rather than Dorris due to June being American. However, upon shaking hands with Senator Jackson he learns that the US government has paid for a nursery for Dorris and is sending her away, with Bob reacting angrily at being manipulated before smashing through the roof of the MOD building and flying off to search for Dorris \u2013 invoking a worldwide manhunt for him with sightings in several locations around the world.\n\nBob eventually finds Dorris in the care home, with local residents forming a barrier to prevent the police from entering as Bob and Dorris manage to express their feelings for each other and Bob convinces her to go to Columbia with him to follow her dream of working with children. Explaining to the crowds and to the media that he's resigning from the MOD and going freelance, Bob declares he is no longer a civil servant or the property of the UK and gives his number for people to call if they need help. After bidding goodbye to Teresa and his mother, Bob flies off into the night with Dorris.\n\nIn the documentary's epilogue, Bob, Dorris and Barry have relocated to Colombia with Bob and Dorris now in a relationship and Bob continuing to work as a superhero.

{"title_page": "Truso", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2012}}\n{{Lead rewrite|date=February 2016}}\n}}\n\n'''Truso''', situated on [[Lake Dru\u017cno]], was an [[Prussia (Baltic)|Old Prussian]] ([[Pomesania]]n) town near the [[Baltic Sea]] just east of the [[Vistula River]]. It was one of the trading posts on the [[Amber Road]], and is thought to be the antecedent of the city of [[Elbl\u0105g]] (Elbing). In the words of [[Marija Gimbutas]], \"the name of the town is the earliest known historically in the Baltic Sea area\".<ref name=\"Gimbutas\">Gimbutas M. ''The Balts.'' London: Thames and Hudson, 1963.</ref> The main export goods of Truso were [[amber]], furs, and slaves, while blacksmithing and amber working were the major industries. The beginnings of the town can be dated back to approximately the end of the 8th century, while in the second half of the 10th century, the town declined and was eclipsed as a trade center by nearby [[Gda\u0144sk]].<ref name=\"bogucki\"/>\n\n== History ==\n\nTruso was situated in a central location upon the Eastern European trade routes, which led from [[Birka]] in the north to the island of [[Gotland]] and to [[Visby]] in the [[Baltic Sea]] and later included the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city of Elbing (since 1945 Elbl\u0105g).  From there, traders continued further south to [[Carnuntum]] in the [[Alps]]. This was called the [[Amber Road]]. The ancient amber roads led further south-west and south-east to the [[Black Sea]] and eventually to Asia. \"For formerly Prussia, Truso played the same role as [[Haithabu]] (Slesvig) or Hedeby for north-western Germany or Slavic [[Vineta]] for [[Pomerania]]\", Gimbutas has observed.<ref name=\"Gimbutas\"/>\n\nEast\u2013west trade route went from Truso and [[Wiskiauten]] (a rival centre in Prussia which sprang up at the south-western corner of the [[Courish Lagoon]]), along the Baltic Sea to [[Jutland]], and  from there up the [[Slien]] inlet to Haithabu/Hedeby, a large trading center in [[Jutland]].

It was one of the trading posts on the [[Amber Road]], and is thought to be the antecedent of the city of [[Elbl\u0105g]] (Elbing). In the words of [[Marija Gimbutas]], \"the name of the town is the earliest known historically in the Baltic Sea area\".<ref name=\"Gimbutas\">Gimbutas M. ''The Balts.'' London: Thames and Hudson, 1963.</ref> The main export goods of Truso were [[amber]], furs, and slaves, while blacksmithing and amber working were the major industries. The beginnings of the town can be dated back to approximately the end of the 8th century, while in the second half of the 10th century, the town declined and was eclipsed as a trade center by nearby Gda\u0144sk.<ref name=\"bogucki\"/>\n\n== History ==\n\nTruso was situated in a central location upon the Eastern European trade routes, which led from [[Birka]] in the north to the island of [[Gotland]] and to [[Visby]] in the [[Baltic Sea]] and later included the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] city of Elbing (since 1945 Elbl\u0105g).  From there, traders continued further south to [[Carnuntum]] in the [[Alps]]. This was called the [[Amber Road]]. The ancient amber roads led further south-west and south-east to the [[Black Sea]] and eventually to Asia. \"For formerly Prussia, Truso played the same role as [[Haithabu]] (Slesvig) or Hedeby for north-western Germany or Slavic [[Vineta]] for [[Pomerania]]\", Gimbutas has observed.<ref name=\"Gimbutas\"/>\n\nEast\u2013west trade route went from Truso and [[Wiskiauten]] (a rival centre in Prussia which sprang up at the south-western corner of the [[Courish Lagoon]]), along the Baltic Sea to [[Jutland]], and  from there up the [[Slien]] inlet to Haithabu/Hedeby, a large trading center in [[Jutland]]. Hedeby, which lay near the modern city of [[Schleswig]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], was pretty centrally located and could be reached from all four directions over land as well as from the [[North Sea]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and the Baltic Sea.\n\nAround the year 890, [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]] (by his own account) undertook a seven-days boat journey from Hedeby to Truso at the behest of king [[Alfred the Great]].
