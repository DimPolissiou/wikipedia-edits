The film tells the story of Bud Fox (Sheen), a young [[stockbroker]] who becomes involved with [[Gordon Gekko]] (Douglas), a wealthy, unscrupulous [[corporate raid]]er.\n\nStone made the film as a tribute to his father, Lou Stone, a stockbroker during the [[Great Depression]]. The character of Gekko is said to be a composite of several people, including [[Dennis Levine]], [[Ivan Boesky]], [[Carl Icahn]], [[Asher Edelman]], [[Michael Milken]], and Stone himself. The character of Sir Lawrence Wildman, meanwhile, was modeled on the prominent British financier and corporate raider [[Jimmy Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]]. Originally, the studio wanted [[Warren Beatty]] to play Gekko, but he was not interested; Stone, meanwhile, wanted [[Richard Gere]], but Gere passed on the role.\n\nThe film was well received among major film critics. Douglas won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], and the film has come to be seen as the archetypal portrayal of 1980s success, with Douglas' character declaring that \"greed, for lack of a better word, is good.\" It has also proven influential in inspiring people to work on Wall Street, with Sheen, Douglas, and Stone commenting over the years how people still approach them and say that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film.\n\nStone and Douglas reunited for a sequel titled ''[[Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps]]'', which was released theatrically on September 24, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1985, Bud Fox is a junior [[stockbroker]] at Jackson Steinem & Co. in [[New York City]]. He wants to work with his hero, [[Gordon Gekko]], a  legendary [[Wall Street]] player. After calling Gekko's office 59 days in a row trying to land an appointment, Bud visits Gekko on his birthday with a box of Gekko's favorite, contraband Cuban cigars. Impressed at his boldness, Gekko grants Bud an interview. Bud pitches him stocks, but Gekko is unimpressed. Desperate, Bud provides him some [[Insider trading|inside information]] about Bluestar Airlines, which he has learned in a casual conversation with his father, Carl, leader of the company's maintenance workers union. Intrigued, Gekko tells Bud he will think about it. A dejected Bud returns to his office. However, Gekko places an order for Bluestar stock and becomes one of Bud's clients. Gekko gives Bud some capital to manage, but the other stocks Bud selects lose money.\n\nGekko offers Bud another chance, and tells him to spy on British CEO Sir Lawrence Wildman and discern Wildman's next move. Bud learns that Wildman is making a bid for a steel company. Through Bud's spying, Gekko makes money, and Wildman is forced to buy Gekko's shares to complete his takeover.\n\nBud becomes wealthy, enjoying Gekko's promised perks, including a penthouse on Manhattan's East Side and a girlfriend, [[Interior decoration|interior decorator]] Darien. Bud is promoted as a result of the large commission fees he is bringing in and is given a [[corner office]] with a view. He continues to maximize inside information and use friends as [[Straw purchase|straw buyers]] to provide more income for him and Gekko. Unknown to Bud, several of his trades attract the attention of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]].\n\nBud pitches a new idea to Gekko: buy Bluestar Airlines and expand the company, with Bud as president, using savings achieved by union concessions and the overfunded pension. Even though Bud is unable to persuade his father to support him and Gekko, he is able to get the unions to push for the deal. Soon afterward, Bud learns that Gekko plans to dissolve the company and sell off Bluestar's assets in order to access cash in the company's pension plan, leaving Carl and the entire Bluestar staff unemployed. Although this would leave Bud a very rich man, he is angered by Gekko's deceit and racked with the guilt of being an accessory to Bluestar's impending destruction, especially after his father suffers a heart attack. Bud resolves to disrupt Gekko's plans, and breaks up with Darien when she refuses to go against Gekko, her former lover.\n\nBud devises a plan to drive up Bluestar's stock before manipulating it back down. He and the other union presidents then secretly meet with Wildman and arrange for him to buy [[controlling interest]] in Bluestar at a significant discount. Gekko, realizing that his stock is plummeting, dumps his remaining interest in the company on Bud's advice. However, when Gekko learns on the evening news that Wildman is buying Bluestar, he realizes that Bud has engineered the entire scheme. Bud triumphantly goes back to work at Jackson Steinem the following day, only to be arrested for insider trading.\n\nSometime later, Bud confronts Gekko in [[Central Park]]. Gekko punches him in the face a couple of times. Mr. Gekko berates him for his role with Bluestar and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for helping them make a case against Gekko. Later, Bud's parents drive him down the [[FDR Drive]] towards the [[New York County Courthouse]] to answer for his crimes.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as [[Gordon Gekko]]\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Bud Fox\n* [[Daryl Hannah]] as Darien Taylor\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Carl Fox\n* [[John C.

And in the third act, he sets out to redeem himself\".<ref name=\"Riordan\"/> Stone asked Weiser to read ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', but Weiser found that its story did not mix well with their own.

It was a long script, and there were some incredibly long and intense monologues to open with. I'd never seen a screenplay where there were two or three pages of single-spaced type for a monologue. I thought, whoa! I mean, it was unbelievable\".<ref name=\"Riordan\"/> For research, he read profiles of corporate raiders [[T. Boone Pickens]] and Carl Icahn.<ref name=\"Riordan\"/>\n\nStone gave Charlie Sheen the choice of [[Jack Lemmon]] or [[Martin Sheen]] to play his father in the film, and Sheen picked his father. The elder Sheen related to the moral sense of his character.<ref name=\"Kiselyak\"/> Stone cast [[Daryl Hannah]] as Bud Fox's materialistic girlfriend Darien Taylor, but felt that she was never happy with the role and did not know why she accepted it. He tried to explain the character to Hannah repeatedly, and thought that the materialism of the character conflicted with Hannah's idealism.<ref name=\"Kiselyak\"/> Stone said later that he was aware early on that she was not right for the part. \"Daryl Hannah was not happy doing the role and I should have let her go. All my crew wanted to get rid of her after one day of shooting. My pride was such that I kept saying I was going to make it work\".<ref name=\"Riordan\"/> Stone also had difficulties with [[Sean Young]], who made her opinions known that Hannah should be fired and that she should play that role instead. Young would show up to the set late and unprepared. She did not get along with Charlie Sheen, which caused further friction on the set. In retrospect, Stone felt that Young was right and he should have swapped Hannah's role with hers.<ref name=\"Riordan\"/> Stone admits that he had \"some problems\" with Young, but was not willing to confirm or deny rumors that she walked off with all of her costumes when she completed filming.<ref name=\"Lipper\"/>\n\n===Principal photography===\nStone wanted to shoot the movie in [[New York City]] and that required a budget of at least $15 million, a moderate shooting budget by 1980s standards. The studio that backed ''Platoon'' felt that it was too risky a project to bankroll and passed. Stone and producer [[Edward R. Pressman]] took it to [[20th Century Fox]] and filming began in April 1987 and ended on July 4 of the same year.<ref name=\"Blair\">{{cite news |last=Blair |first=Cynthia |title=1987: ''Wall Street'' Filmed in New York City |work=[[Newsday]] |year=2008 |url=http://www.newsday.com/other/special/ny-ihiny090904story,0,2269738.htmlstory |accessdate=March 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207012006/http://www.newsday.com/other/special/ny-ihiny090904story%2C0%2C2269738.htmlstory |archivedate=December 7, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Parts of the film were shot in [[Snowbird, Utah]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}</ref> According to Stone, he was \"making a movie about sharks, about feeding frenzies.

Lipper brought a balance to the film and this helped Stone get permission to shoot on the floor of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] during trading hours.<ref name=\"Welles\"/> Lipper and Stone disagreed over the character of Lou Mannheim. Stone shot a scene showing the honest Mannheim giving in to insider trading, but Lipper argued that audiences might conclude that everyone on Wall Street is corrupt and insisted that the film needed an unimpeachable character.

He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that he sees as a threat to his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings form the basis of the film's subtext.<ref name=\"Gabriel\"/> This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]''. In ''Wall Street'' the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the [[creative destruction]] brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.<ref name=\"Gabriel\"/>\n\nA significant scene in the film is a speech by Gekko to a shareholders' meeting of Teldar Paper, a company he is planning to take over. Stone uses this scene to give Gekko, and by extension, the [[Wall Street]] raiders he personifies, the chance to justify their actions, portraying himself as a liberator of the company value from the ineffective and excessively compensated executives.<ref name=\"Gabriel\"/> The inspiration for the \"Greed is good\" speech seems to have come from two sources. The first part, where Gekko complains that the company's management owns less than three percent of its stock, and that it has too many vice presidents, is taken from similar speeches and comments made by [[Carl Icahn]] about companies he was trying to take over.<ref name=\"Gabriel\"/> The defense of greed is a paraphrase of the May 18, 1986, commencement address at the [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]'s School of Business Administration, delivered by arbitrageur [[Ivan Boesky]] (who himself was later convicted of insider trading charges), in which he said, \"Greed is all right, by the way.

In one scene, Gekko scoffs at Bud Fox's question as to the moral value of hard work, quoting the example of his (Gekko's) father, who worked hard his entire life only to die in debt. Lou Mannheim, the film's archetypal mentor, says early in the film, that \"good things sometimes take time\", referring to [[IBM]] and [[Hilton Hotels Corporation|Hilton]]\u2014in contrast, Gekko's \"Greed is Good\" credo typifies the short-term view prevalent in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Gabriel\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Wall Street'' was released on December 11, 1987, in 730 theaters and grossed $4.1 million on its opening weekend.

The film tells the story of Bud Fox (Sheen), a young [[stockbroker]] who becomes involved with [[Gordon Gekko]] (Douglas), a wealthy, unscrupulous [[corporate raid]]er.\n\nStone made the film as a tribute to his father, Lou Stone, a stockbroker during the [[Great Depression]]. The character of Gekko is said to be a composite of several people, including [[Dennis Levine]], [[Ivan Boesky]], [[Carl Icahn]], [[Asher Edelman]], [[Michael Milken]], and Stone himself. The character of Sir Lawrence Wildman, meanwhile, was modeled on the prominent British financier and corporate raider [[Jimmy Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]]. Originally, the studio wanted [[Warren Beatty]] to play Gekko, but he was not interested; Stone, meanwhile, wanted [[Richard Gere]], but Gere passed on the role.\n\nThe film was well received among major film critics. Douglas won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], and the film has come to be seen as the archetypal portrayal of 1980s success, with Douglas' character declaring that \"greed, for lack of a better word, is good.\" It has also proven influential in inspiring people to work on Wall Street, with Sheen, Douglas, and Stone commenting over the years how people still approach them and say that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film.\n\nStone and Douglas reunited for a sequel titled ''[[Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps]]'', which was released theatrically on September 24, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1985, Bud Fox is a junior [[stockbroker]] at Jackson Steinem & Co. in [[New York City]]. He wants to work with his hero, [[Gordon Gekko]], a  legendary [[Wall Street]] player. After calling Gekko's office 59 days in a row trying to land an appointment, Bud visits Gekko on his birthday with a box of Gekko's favorite, contraband Cuban cigars. Impressed at his boldness, Gekko grants Bud an interview. Bud pitches him stocks, but Gekko is unimpressed. Desperate, Bud provides him some [[Insider trading|inside information]] about Bluestar Airlines, which he has learned in a casual conversation with his father, Carl, leader of the company's maintenance workers union. Intrigued, Gekko tells Bud he will think about it. A dejected Bud returns to his office. However, Gekko places an order for Bluestar stock and becomes one of Bud's clients. Gekko gives Bud some capital to manage, but the other stocks Bud selects lose money.\n\nGekko offers Bud another chance, and tells him to spy on British CEO Sir Lawrence Wildman and discern Wildman's next move. Bud learns that Wildman is making a bid for a steel company. Through Bud's spying, Gekko makes money, and Wildman is forced to buy Gekko's shares to complete his takeover.\n\nBud becomes wealthy, enjoying Gekko's promised perks, including a penthouse on Manhattan's East Side and a girlfriend, [[Interior decoration|interior decorator]] Darien. Bud is promoted as a result of the large commission fees he is bringing in and is given a [[corner office]] with a view. He continues to maximize inside information and use friends as [[Straw purchase|straw buyers]] to provide more income for him and Gekko. Unknown to Bud, several of his trades attract the attention of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]].\n\nBud pitches a new idea to Gekko: buy Bluestar Airlines and expand the company, with Bud as president, using savings achieved by union concessions and the overfunded pension. Even though Bud is unable to persuade his father to support him and Gekko, he is able to get the unions to push for the deal. Soon afterward, Bud learns that Gekko plans to dissolve the company and sell off Bluestar's assets in order to access cash in the company's pension plan, leaving Carl and the entire Bluestar staff unemployed. Although this would leave Bud a very rich man, he is angered by Gekko's deceit and racked with the guilt of being an accessory to Bluestar's impending destruction, especially after his father suffers a heart attack. Bud resolves to disrupt Gekko's plans, and breaks up with Darien when she refuses to go against Gekko, her former lover.\n\nBud devises a plan to drive up Bluestar's stock before manipulating it back down. He and the other union presidents then secretly meet with Wildman and arrange for him to buy [[controlling interest]] in Bluestar at a significant discount. Gekko, realizing that his stock is plummeting, dumps his remaining interest in the company on Bud's advice. However, when Gekko learns on the evening news that Wildman is buying Bluestar, he realizes that Bud has engineered the entire scheme. Bud triumphantly goes back to work at Jackson Steinem the following day, only to be arrested for insider trading.\n\nSometime later, Bud confronts Gekko in [[Central Park]]. Gekko punches him in the face a couple of times. Mr. Gekko berates him for his role with Bluestar and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for helping them make a case against Gekko. Later, Bud's parents drive him down the [[FDR Drive]] towards the [[New York County Courthouse]] to answer for his crimes.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as [[Gordon Gekko]]\n* [[Charlie Sheen]] as Bud Fox\n* [[Daryl Hannah]] as Darien Taylor\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Carl Fox\n* [[John C.

This man started making mistakes that cost him everything. Stone remembers that the \"story frames what happens in my movie, which is basically a ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress|Pilgrim's Progress]]'' of a boy who is seduced and corrupted by the allure of easy money. And in the third act, he sets out to redeem himself\".<ref name=\"Riordan\"/> Stone asked Weiser to read ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', but Weiser found that its story did not mix well with their own. Stone then asked Weiser to read ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' for material that they could use, but it was not the right fit either.<ref name=\"Weiser\"/> Weiser had no prior knowledge of the financial world and immersed himself in researching the world of stock trading, [[junk bond]]s, and corporate takeovers. He and Stone spent three weeks visiting [[brokerage firm|brokerage houses]] and interviewing investors.<ref name=\"Weiser\"/>\n\n===Screenplay===\nWeiser wrote the first draft, initially called ''Greed'', with Stone writing another draft. Originally, the lead character was a young Jewish broker named Freddie Goldsmith, but Stone changed it to Bud Fox to avoid the stereotype that Wall Street was controlled by Jews.<ref name=\"Riordan\"/> Reportedly, Gordon Gekko is said to be a composite of several people: Wall Street broker Owen Morrisey, an old friend of Stone's<ref>{{cite book|last=Lavington|first=Stephen|title=Virgin Film: Oliver Stone|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uf6jNxx0ppMC&pg=PT145|year=2011|publisher=Ebury|isbn=9780753547663|page=145}}</ref> who was involved in a $20 million insider trading scandal in 1985, [[Dennis Levine]], [[Ivan Boesky]],<ref name=\"Crowdus\">{{cite news |last=Crowdus |first=Gary |title=Personal Struggles and Political Issues |work=Cineaste |year=1987 |url=http://www.cineaste.com/articles/stone-interview.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=February 26, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226194916/http://www.cineaste.com/articles/stone-interview.pdf |archivedate=February 26, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> corporate raider [[Carl Icahn]], [[art collector]] [[Asher Edelman]], agent [[Michael Ovitz]], and Stone himself.<ref name=\"Weiser\"/> For example, the \"Greed, for lack of a better word, is good\" line was based on a speech by Boesky (to the 1986 graduating class of the U.C.

Pressman]], producer of the film, \"Originally, there was no one individual who Gekko was modeled on\", he adds, \"But Gekko was partly [[Michael Milken|Milken]]\".

It was a long script, and there were some incredibly long and intense monologues to open with. I'd never seen a screenplay where there were two or three pages of single-spaced type for a monologue. I thought, whoa! I mean, it was unbelievable\".<ref name=\"Riordan\"/> For research, he read profiles of corporate raiders [[T. Boone Pickens]] and Carl Icahn.<ref name=\"Riordan\"/>\n\nStone gave Charlie Sheen the choice of [[Jack Lemmon]] or [[Martin Sheen]] to play his father in the film, and Sheen picked his father. The elder Sheen related to the moral sense of his character.<ref name=\"Kiselyak\"/> Stone cast [[Daryl Hannah]] as Bud Fox's materialistic girlfriend Darien Taylor, but felt that she was never happy with the role and did not know why she accepted it. He tried to explain the character to Hannah repeatedly, and thought that the materialism of the character conflicted with Hannah's idealism.<ref name=\"Kiselyak\"/> Stone said later that he was aware early on that she was not right for the part. \"Daryl Hannah was not happy doing the role and I should have let her go. All my crew wanted to get rid of her after one day of shooting. My pride was such that I kept saying I was going to make it work\".<ref name=\"Riordan\"/> Stone also had difficulties with [[Sean Young]], who made her opinions known that Hannah should be fired and that she should play that role instead. Young would show up to the set late and unprepared. She did not get along with Charlie Sheen, which caused further friction on the set. In retrospect, Stone felt that Young was right and he should have swapped Hannah's role with hers.<ref name=\"Riordan\"/> Stone admits that he had \"some problems\" with Young, but was not willing to confirm or deny rumors that she walked off with all of her costumes when she completed filming.<ref name=\"Lipper\"/>\n\n===Principal photography===\nStone wanted to shoot the movie in [[New York City]] and that required a budget of at least $15 million, a moderate shooting budget by 1980s standards. The studio that backed ''Platoon'' felt that it was too risky a project to bankroll and passed. Stone and producer [[Edward R. Pressman]] took it to [[20th Century Fox]] and filming began in April 1987 and ended on July 4 of the same year.<ref name=\"Blair\">{{cite news |last=Blair |first=Cynthia |title=1987: ''Wall Street'' Filmed in New York City |work=[[Newsday]] |year=2008 |url=http://www.newsday.com/other/special/ny-ihiny090904story,0,2269738.htmlstory |accessdate=March 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207012006/http://www.newsday.com/other/special/ny-ihiny090904story%2C0%2C2269738.htmlstory |archivedate=December 7, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Parts of the film were shot in [[Snowbird, Utah]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=D'Arc|first1=James V.|title=When Hollywood came to town: a history of moviemaking in Utah|date=2010|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Layton, Utah|isbn=9781423605874|edition=1st}}</ref> According to Stone, he was \"making a movie about sharks, about feeding frenzies.

He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that he sees as a threat to his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings form the basis of the film's subtext.<ref name=\"Gabriel\"/> This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]''. In ''Wall Street'' the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the [[creative destruction]] brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.<ref name=\"Gabriel\"/>\n\nA significant scene in the film is a speech by Gekko to a shareholders' meeting of Teldar Paper, a company he is planning to take over. Stone uses this scene to give Gekko, and by extension, the [[Wall Street]] raiders he personifies, the chance to justify their actions, portraying himself as a liberator of the company value from the ineffective and excessively compensated executives.<ref name=\"Gabriel\"/> The inspiration for the \"Greed is good\" speech seems to have come from two sources. The first part, where Gekko complains that the company's management owns less than three percent of its stock, and that it has too many vice presidents, is taken from similar speeches and comments made by [[Carl Icahn]] about companies he was trying to take over.<ref name=\"Gabriel\"/> The defense of greed is a paraphrase of the May 18, 1986, commencement address at the [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]'s School of Business Administration, delivered by arbitrageur [[Ivan Boesky]] (who himself was later convicted of insider trading charges), in which he said, \"Greed is all right, by the way.

In one scene, Gekko scoffs at Bud Fox's question as to the moral value of hard work, quoting the example of his (Gekko's) father, who worked hard his entire life only to die in debt. Lou Mannheim, the film's archetypal mentor, says early in the film, that \"good things sometimes take time\", referring to [[IBM]] and [[Hilton Hotels Corporation|Hilton]]\u2014in contrast, Gekko's \"Greed is Good\" credo typifies the short-term view prevalent in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Gabriel\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n''Wall Street'' was released on December 11, 1987, in 730 theaters and grossed $4.1 million on its opening weekend.
