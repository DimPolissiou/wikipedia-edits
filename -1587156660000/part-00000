There are 8 officers on the Board. For details on the Board's clubs, see [[:Category:Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Cavan|Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Cavan]] and [[List of Gaelic games clubs in Ireland#Cavan]].\nThe Board is subject to the [[Ulster GAA]] Provincial Council.\n{{Cavan GAA clubs|state=collapsed}}\nThe teams of Cavan GAA play home games at [[Kingspan Breffni Park]], [[Cavan]]. The current football manager is Mickey Graham, who took over following the resignation of Mattie McGleenan in 2018.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nThe following is a list of sponsors of the Cavan Senior Football team\n* 1992: Holybrook Construction\n* 1993: Atlanta Conservatories\n* 1994: Cavan Co-op Mart \n* 1995 \u2013 present: [[Kingspan Group]]\nCavan have had only 4 sponsorship deals since sponsors on jerseys were permitted by the GAA in 1991. There was no sponsorship on GAA jerseys until the 2nd game of the Meath V Dublin 4 in a row in 1991 so only a handful of teams had sponsorship in 1991. In 1992 Holybrook Construction sponsored the jerseys although it was only for 1 game. For the 1993-94 seasons Cavan Co-op Mart took over sponsorship. Kingspan has continuously sponsored Cavan since 1995.\n\n===Crest and symbols===\n[[File:Cavan Coat of Arms.png|left|thumb|100px|Coat of Arms of County Cavan]]\nThe first crest that adorned the Cavan jerseys was the Coat of Arms for [[County Cavan]]. The crest was split into four quadrants and included\n* the red hand of Ulster encased in an outline of the Franciscan Abbey which is situated in Cavan town and where the O'Reilly chieftains are buried. Here also lies the remains of an Ulster leader, Eoghan Rua O'Neill. \n*The Rampant Lion from the coat of arms of the O\u2019Reilly clans, who were the local lords.\nIn 2004 Cavan released a new crest for the Breifne County. The crest was designed by the [[List of Presidents of the Gaelic Athletic Association|38th President]] of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] Aog\u00e1n Farrell and Cavan Central Council rep. George Cartwright. The crest draws on cultural, physical and historical influences. The primary colours are blue and white with Ulster's red hand and G.A.A. yellow also prominent. The designers wanted to reflect the following elements\n*Breifne: The ancient Gaelic territory. Modern Cavan was once \"O Reilly country\" and the ancient Gaelic kingdom of Breifne is preserved in the name of the home pitch in Cavan and now on its crest\n*Franciscan Abbey: The mediaeval tower from the Abbey in Cavan Town fills the lower quadrant. Here the O' Reilly\u2019s invited the Franciscans to establish a monastery. The O'Reilly chieftains are buried here. Here also lie the remains of Ulster's great leader, Eoghan Rua O'Neill\n*GAA Logo: The GAA modern logo fills the right quadrant. The logo is representative of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]].\n*Red Hand 1886:  The first GAA club founded in the province of Ulster was formed in Cavan. [[Ballyconnell First Ulsters GFC|Ballyconnell First Ulsters]] formed in 1885 and affiliated in 1886. The date is preserved in the crest. A red hand has always appeared on Cavan crests. \n*Lakes and Hills: Our landscape is dominated by \"wee lakes and hills\". The environment shapes us and this is reflected on the new crest.\n\n==Gaelic football==\n\n===History===\n[[File:Cavan vs Queens - 2009.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Cavan (blue) in action against [[Queen's University Belfast]] in the 2009 [[Dr. McKenna Cup]]]]\nThe first GAA club in Cavan and in Ulster was founded in [[Ballyconnell]] in late 1885 called Ballyconnell Joe Biggars in honour of west Cavan Nationalist MP Joe Biggar. The name of the club was later changed to Ballyconnell First Ulsters.\n\nThe very first Cavan County Final, under GAA rules was played in a field outside Cavan Town on 30 April 1887. The final was contested by Ballyconnell First Ulster\u2019s and Maghera MacFinns. MacFinns recorded a famous victory on a score line of 1-4 to First Ulster\u2019s 0-1, thus entering the history books as Cavan\u2019s first Champions.\n\nCavan are the most successful football county in Ulster, having won the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] 5 times, the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] 39 times, and the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] once.\nCavan's first All-Ireland victory came in [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1933]]. They foiled [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]]'s five-in-a-row bid with a last minute goal from Vincent McGovern in the All-Ireland Semi-Final at Breffni Park 1933, and went on to beat [[Galway GAA|Galway]] by a point in [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|the final]], to become the first Ulster county to win the Sam Maguire Cup. Two years later, Cavan beat [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] in the [[1935 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1935 final]] to bring home their second title in three years.\n\nCavan's third, and most famous All-Ireland title came in [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1947]], defeating [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] in the famous [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]] in the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[New York City]], the only time the final was held outside of Ireland. They followed this up with a one-point win over [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] in [[1948 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1948]], to win back-to-back titles for the first time. They reached their third successive [[1949 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]] in [[1949 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1949]], but they were denied a three-in-a-row by [[Meath GAA|Meath]], losing by four points.\nCavan later gained revenge for this defeat, beating Meath after a replay in [[1952 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1952]] to bring home their fifth, and so far last, All-Ireland title. Cavan have not appeared in another All-Ireland final since.\n\nHistorically, Cavan have dominated the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]], winning a record 39 titles. Despite this, Cavan have won only one Ulster Championship since 1969, this success coming in the [[1997 Ulster Senior Football Championship Final|1997 final]], after beating [[Derry GAA|Derry]] by a point. Cavan's most recent Ulster Final appearance was in [[2019 Ulster Senior Football Championship|2019]], losing to [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]].\n\nThe current Cavan manager is Mickey Graham.\n\n===Honours===\n{{main|Cavan GAA Honours}}\nCavan have won the [[All-Ireland Football Championship|All-Ireland Football]] final on 5 occasions \u2013 All 5 victories came between 1933 and 1952.\nMeanwhile, they have won the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship|Ulster Championship]] on 39 occasions. Their last came in 1997 when they beat [[Derry GAA|Derry]] 1-14 to 0-16. It was their first Ulster title in 28 years.\nCavan have won the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] once, in [[1947\u201348 National Football League (Ireland)|1947/48]].\n*'''[[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]]s:''' 5\n**[[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1933]], [[1935 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1935]], [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1947]], [[1948 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1948]], [[1952 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1952]]\n*'''[[All-Ireland Minor Football Championship]]s:''' 2\n**1937, 1938\n*'''[[All-Ireland Junior Football Championship]]s:''' 2\n**1927, 2014\n*'''[[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]]:''' 1\n**1947/48\n*'''[[Ulster Senior Football Championship]]s:''' 39\n**1891, 1903, 1904, 1905, 1915, 1918, 1919, 1920, 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1928, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1952, 1954, 1955, 1962, 1964, 1967, 1969, 1997\n*'''[[Ulster Under-21 Football Championship]]s:''' 6\n**1988, 1996, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n*'''[[Ulster Minor Football Championship]]s:''' 6\n**1937, 1938, 1952, 1959, 1974, 2011\n*'''[[Ulster Junior Football Championship]]s:''' 14\n**1914, 1915, 1916, 1924, 1927, 1932, 1936, 1938, 1940, 1941, 1944, 1957, 1962, 1984\n*'''[[Leinster Junior Football Championship]]s:''' 2\n**2012, 2014\n*'''[[Dr. McKenna Cup]]s:''' 11\n**1936, 1940, 1943, 1951, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1962, 1968, 1988, 2000\n===Famous players===\n* [[Simon Deignan]]\n* [[P.

Templeport are the most successful junior team, having won six times.\n\n==Hurling==\n\n===History===\nTraditionally the County board has actively discouraged hurling through their policies football but Hurling has been present in the county. The championship has never been held consistently and at times wasn\u2019t finished. Belturbet won the first [[Cavan Senior Hurling Championship]] in 1908. Hurling was revived in Cavan in 1917. Cavan Slashers were the standout Hurling team of the early period winning the championship in 1922, 1924, 1927 and 1928.  They also won 4-in-a-row between 1933 and 1936.\n\nAgain hurling died away in the county with only eight championships been finished between 1937 and 1981. Ballyhaise won successive championships in 1948 and 1949. Granard won their first championship in 1950 and [[Bailieboro Shamrocks GFC|Bailieboro Shamrocks]] and Cavan Gaels dominated the 1970s and the early 1980s. Bailieborough were victorious in 1966. Cavan Gaels won in 1973 and 1974. Bailieborough won their second championship ten years after the first in 1976 and won again in 1977.\n\n1982 saw the start of Cavan\u2019s most successful period in their Hurling history due to the influence of soldiers from hurling counties such as Kilkenny, Clare and Cork who were stationed at the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the troubles. From 1982 to 1985 Cavan Gaels and [[Bailieboro Shamrocks GFC|Bailieboro Shamrocks]] won 2 Championships each. Bailieborough won in 1982 and 1984 and Cavan Gaels in 1983 and 1985. The County team also had success winning the [[Ulster Junior Hurling Championship]] in 1983 and 1985. In-between both Championships they won the [[National Hurling League]] Division 4 in 1984.\n\nWoodford Gaels broke the Cavan Gaels/Bailieborough dominance and won the next 3 championships 1986-1988. No championship was held in 1989 but the 1990s saw the start of the Mullahoran dominance. Mulllahoran won an amazing 21 [[Cavan Senior Hurling Championship]] between 1990 and 2010. Mullahoran\u2019s dominance was finally broken by Ballymachugh who were runners up to Mullahoran 2005, 2008 and 2009. They beat Mullahoran in 2011 on a score of 4-08 to 1-06. No championship took place in 2012 and Mullahoran won their 22nd championship in 2013 beating Cootehill Celtic 0-13 to 0-04. \n\nIn 2011 after a disastrous Division 4 league campaign where they ended with a -157 scoring difference the decision was made to discontinue the senior hurling team resulting in Cavan being the only county in Ireland without a senior hurling representative team for nearly 6 years. \n\nCavan turned out a team for the first time in six years in 2017, and played in the [[Lory Meagher Cup]] in [[2017 Lory Meagher Cup|2017]], and re-entered the [[National Hurling League]] in [[2018 National Hurling League|2018]].\n\n===Honours===\n{{main|Cavan GAA Honours}}\nCavan won the [[Ulster Junior Hurling Championship]] in 1983 and 1985.

They lost to Galway by 4-4 to 0-3 in the 1940 All Ireland semi-final, but drew with Dublin in the 1941 semi-final 4-0 to 3-3, thanks to a last-minute goal from Rita Sullivan, losing the replay 3-4 to 1-1.

There are 8 officers on the Board. For details on the Board's clubs, see [[:Category:Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Cavan|Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Cavan]] and [[List of Gaelic games clubs in Ireland#Cavan]].\nThe Board is subject to the [[Ulster GAA]] Provincial Council.\n{{Cavan GAA clubs|state=collapsed}}\nThe teams of Cavan GAA play home games at [[Kingspan Breffni Park]], [[Cavan]]. The current football manager is Mickey Graham, who took over following the resignation of Mattie McGleenan in 2018.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nThe following is a list of sponsors of the Cavan Senior Football team\n* 1992: Holybrook Construction\n* 1993: Atlanta Conservatories\n* 1994: Cavan Co-op Mart \n* 1995 \u2013 present: [[Kingspan Group]]\nCavan have had only 4 sponsorship deals since sponsors on jerseys were permitted by the GAA in 1991. There was no sponsorship on GAA jerseys until the 2nd game of the Meath V Dublin 4 in a row in 1991 so only a handful of teams had sponsorship in 1991. In 1992 Holybrook Construction sponsored the jerseys although it was only for 1 game. For the 1993-94 seasons Cavan Co-op Mart took over sponsorship. Kingspan has continuously sponsored Cavan since 1995.\n\n===Crest and symbols===\n[[File:Cavan Coat of Arms.png|left|thumb|100px|Coat of Arms of County Cavan]]\nThe first crest that adorned the Cavan jerseys was the Coat of Arms for [[County Cavan]]. The crest was split into four quadrants and included\n* the red hand of Ulster encased in an outline of the Franciscan Abbey which is situated in Cavan town and where the O'Reilly chieftains are buried. Here also lies the remains of an Ulster leader, Eoghan Rua O'Neill. \n*The Rampant Lion from the coat of arms of the O\u2019Reilly clans, who were the local lords.\nIn 2004 Cavan released a new crest for the Breifne County. The crest was designed by the [[List of Presidents of the Gaelic Athletic Association|38th President]] of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] Aog\u00e1n Farrell and Cavan Central Council rep. George Cartwright. The crest draws on cultural, physical and historical influences. The primary colours are blue and white with Ulster's red hand and G.A.A. yellow also prominent. The designers wanted to reflect the following elements\n*Breifne: The ancient Gaelic territory. Modern Cavan was once \"O Reilly country\" and the ancient Gaelic kingdom of Breifne is preserved in the name of the home pitch in Cavan and now on its crest\n*Franciscan Abbey: The mediaeval tower from the Abbey in Cavan Town fills the lower quadrant. Here the O' Reilly\u2019s invited the Franciscans to establish a monastery. The O'Reilly chieftains are buried here. Here also lie the remains of Ulster's great leader, Eoghan Rua O'Neill\n*GAA Logo: The GAA modern logo fills the right quadrant. The logo is representative of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]].\n*Red Hand 1886:  The first GAA club founded in the province of Ulster was formed in Cavan. [[Ballyconnell First Ulsters GFC|Ballyconnell First Ulsters]] formed in 1885 and affiliated in 1886. The date is preserved in the crest. A red hand has always appeared on Cavan crests. \n*Lakes and Hills: Our landscape is dominated by \"wee lakes and hills\". The environment shapes us and this is reflected on the new crest.\n\n==Gaelic football==\n\n===History===\n[[File:Cavan vs Queens - 2009.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Cavan (blue) in action against [[Queen's University Belfast]] in the 2009 [[Dr. McKenna Cup]]]]\nThe first GAA club in Cavan and in Ulster was founded in [[Ballyconnell]] in late 1885 called Ballyconnell Joe Biggars in honour of west Cavan Nationalist MP Joe Biggar. The name of the club was later changed to Ballyconnell First Ulsters.\n\nThe very first Cavan County Final, under GAA rules was played in a field outside Cavan Town on 30 April 1887. The final was contested by Ballyconnell First Ulster\u2019s and Maghera MacFinns. MacFinns recorded a famous victory on a score line of 1-4 to First Ulster\u2019s 0-1, thus entering the history books as Cavan\u2019s first Champions.\n\nCavan are the most successful football county in Ulster, having won the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] 5 times, the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] 39 times, and the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] once.\nCavan's first All-Ireland victory came in [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1933]]. They foiled [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]]'s five-in-a-row bid with a last minute goal from Vincent McGovern in the All-Ireland Semi-Final at Breffni Park 1933, and went on to beat [[Galway GAA|Galway]] by a point in [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|the final]], to become the first Ulster county to win the Sam Maguire Cup. Two years later, Cavan beat [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] in the [[1935 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1935 final]] to bring home their second title in three years.\n\nCavan's third, and most famous All-Ireland title came in [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1947]], defeating [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] in the famous [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]] in the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[New York City]], the only time the final was held outside of Ireland. They followed this up with a one-point win over [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] in [[1948 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1948]], to win back-to-back titles for the first time. They reached their third successive [[1949 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]] in [[1949 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1949]], but they were denied a three-in-a-row by [[Meath GAA|Meath]], losing by four points.\nCavan later gained revenge for this defeat, beating Meath after a replay in [[1952 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1952]] to bring home their fifth, and so far last, All-Ireland title. Cavan have not appeared in another All-Ireland final since.\n\nHistorically, Cavan have dominated the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]], winning a record 39 titles. Despite this, Cavan have won only one Ulster Championship since 1969, this success coming in the [[1997 Ulster Senior Football Championship Final|1997 final]], after beating [[Derry GAA|Derry]] by a point. Cavan's most recent Ulster Final appearance was in [[2019 Ulster Senior Football Championship|2019]], losing to [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]].\n\nThe current Cavan manager is Mickey Graham.\n\n===Honours===\n{{main|Cavan GAA Honours}}\nCavan have won the [[All-Ireland Football Championship|All-Ireland Football]] final on 5 occasions \u2013 All 5 victories came between 1933 and 1952.\nMeanwhile, they have won the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship|Ulster Championship]] on 39 occasions.

The championship has never been held consistently and at times wasn\u2019t finished. Belturbet won the first [[Cavan Senior Hurling Championship]] in 1908. Hurling was revived in Cavan in 1917. Cavan Slashers were the standout Hurling team of the early period winning the championship in 1922, 1924, 1927 and 1928.  They also won 4-in-a-row between 1933 and 1936.\n\nAgain hurling died away in the county with only eight championships been finished between 1937 and 1981. Ballyhaise won successive championships in 1948 and 1949. Granard won their first championship in 1950 and [[Bailieboro Shamrocks GFC|Bailieboro Shamrocks]] and Cavan Gaels dominated the 1970s and the early 1980s. Bailieborough were victorious in 1966. Cavan Gaels won in 1973 and 1974. Bailieborough won their second championship ten years after the first in 1976 and won again in 1977.\n\n1982 saw the start of Cavan\u2019s most successful period in their Hurling history due to the influence of soldiers from hurling counties such as Kilkenny, Clare and Cork who were stationed at the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the troubles. From 1982 to 1985 Cavan Gaels and [[Bailieboro Shamrocks GFC|Bailieboro Shamrocks]] won 2 Championships each. Bailieborough won in 1982 and 1984 and Cavan Gaels in 1983 and 1985.

In-between both Championships they won the [[National Hurling League]] Division 4 in 1984.\n\nWoodford Gaels broke the Cavan Gaels/Bailieborough dominance and won the next 3 championships 1986-1988. No championship was held in 1989 but the 1990s saw the start of the Mullahoran dominance. Mulllahoran won an amazing 21 [[Cavan Senior Hurling Championship]] between 1990 and 2010. Mullahoran\u2019s dominance was finally broken by Ballymachugh who were runners up to Mullahoran 2005, 2008 and 2009. They beat Mullahoran in 2011 on a score of 4-08 to 1-06. No championship took place in 2012 and Mullahoran won their 22nd championship in 2013 beating Cootehill Celtic 0-13 to 0-04. \n\nIn 2011 after a disastrous Division 4 league campaign where they ended with a -157 scoring difference the decision was made to discontinue the senior hurling team resulting in Cavan being the only county in Ireland without a senior hurling representative team for nearly 6 years. \n\nCavan turned out a team for the first time in six years in 2017, and played in the [[Lory Meagher Cup]] in [[2017 Lory Meagher Cup|2017]], and re-entered the [[National Hurling League]] in [[2018 National Hurling League|2018]].\n\n===Honours===\n{{main|Cavan GAA Honours}}\nCavan won the [[Ulster Junior Hurling Championship]] in 1983 and 1985.

The initial plan \"was to build and maintain\" a long distance coastal footpath from [[Topsail Beach]] to [[Trepassey]] and in 1997 the Association obtained funds from the Federal Government to develop this 220&nbsp;km trail. In 2001 this trail was officially opened.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=PjB1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA352&lpg=PA352&dq=east+coast+trail+introduction+to+nonprofit+management+text+and+cases&source=bl&ots=KXIQJy6ojk&sig=ACfU3U0cvigYbE4X1C4SNtrP272ZR9fF8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjn94ScjLboAhWkAp0JHYsiCvgQ6AEwAHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=east%20coast%20trail%20introduction%20to%20nonprofit%20management%20text%20and%20cases&f=false ''Introduction to Nonprofit Management: Text and Cases'', edited by W.

It was inhabited by the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] and [[Arawak peoples|Arawakan]] people, who variously called their island ''Ayiti'', ''Bohio'', and ''Kiskeya'' ''(Quisqueya)''. Columbus promptly claimed the island for the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]], naming it ''La Isla Espa\u00f1ola'' (\"the Spanish Island\"), later [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] to ''[[Hispaniola]]''. French influence began in 1625, and French control of what was called [[Saint-Domingue]] in modern-day Haiti began in 1660. From 1697 on, the western part of the island was French, and the eastern part was Spanish. Haiti became one of the wealthiest of France's colonies, producing vast quantities of sugar and coffee and depending on a brutal slave system for the necessary labor. Inspired by the message of the [[French Revolution]], Haitian slaves rose up in [[Haitian Revolution#The Revolution|revolt]] in 1791, and after decades of struggle, the independent republic of Haiti was officially proclaimed in 1804.\n\n==Pre-Spanish history==\n{{Main|Chiefdoms of Hispaniola}}\nSuccessive waves of [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] migrants, moving northward from the [[Orinoco]] delta in South America, settled the islands of the [[Caribbean]]. Around A.D. 600, the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]], an Arawak culture, arrived on the island, displacing the previous inhabitants. They were organized into ''[[cacicazgo]]s'' (chiefdoms), each led by a ''cacique'' (chief). hairy balls\n\n==Spanish history (1492\u20131625)==\n[[Christopher Columbus]] established the settlement, [[La Navidad]], near the modern town of [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]]. It was built from the timbers of his wrecked ship, [[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|Santa Mar\u00eda]], during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|first voyage]] in December 1492. When he returned in 1493 on his second voyage he found the settlement had been destroyed and all 39 settlers killed. Columbus continued east and founded a new settlement at [[La Isabela]] on the territory of the present-day [[Dominican Republic]] in 1493. The capital of the colony was moved to [[Santo Domingo]] in 1496, on the south west coast of the island also in the territory of the present-day Dominican Republic. The Spanish returned to western Hispaniola in 1502, establishing a settlement at Yaguana near modern-day [[L\u00e9og\u00e2ne]]. A second settlement was established on the north coast in 1504 called Puerto Real near modern [[Fort-Libert\u00e9]] \u2013 which in 1578 was relocated to a nearby site and renamed Bayaja.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haitiantreasures.com/HT_fort-liberte.htm |title=Fort-Libert\u00e9: A captivating Site |accessdate=2010-07-01 |publisher=Haitian Treasures |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527062805/http://www.haitiantreasures.com/HT_fort-liberte.htm |archivedate=27 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Clammer |first=Paul |author2=Michael Grosberg |author3=Jens Porup |title=Dominican Republic and Haiti |pages=339, 330\u2013333 |accessdate=2010-07-01 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kjde3Fmwb7IC&pg=PA340 |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-74104-292-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://population.mongabay.com/population/haiti/3725170/fort-liberte |title=Population of Fort Libert\u00e9, Haiti |accessdate=2010-07-01 |publisher=Mongabay.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717220658/http://population.mongabay.com/population/haiti/3725170/fort-liberte |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the arrival of Europeans, La Hispaniola's indigenous population suffered greatly to near extinction, in possibly the worst case of depopulation in the Americas. A commonly accepted hypothesis attributes the high mortality of this colony in part to European diseases to which the natives had no immunity. A small number of [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00ednos]] were able to survive and set up villages elsewhere. Spanish interest in [[Hispaniola]] began to wane in the 1520s, as more lucrative [[gold]] and [[silver]] deposits were found in Mexico and South America. Thereafter, the population of Spanish Hispaniola grew at a slow pace.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe settlement of Yaguana was burnt to the ground three times in its just over a century long existence as a Spanish settlement, first by French pirates in 1543, again on May 27, 1592, by a 110-strong landing party from a four-ship English naval squadron led by [[Christopher Newport]] in his flagship Golden Dragon, who destroyed all 150 houses in the settlement, and finally by the Spanish themselves in 1605, for reasons set out below.<ref>''Historic Cities of the Americas: An Illustrated Encyclopedia'' (2005).

The Dutch responded by sourcing new salt supplies from Spanish America where colonists were more than happy to trade. So large numbers of Dutch traders/pirates joined their English and French brethren trading on the remote coasts of Hispaniola. In 1605, Spain was infuriated that Spanish settlements on the northern and western coasts of the island persisted in carrying out large scale and illegal trade with the Dutch, who were at that time fighting a war of independence against Spain in Europe and the English, a very recent enemy state, and so decided to forcibly resettle their inhabitants closer to the city of [[Santo Domingo]].<ref>Knight, Franklin, ''The Caribbean: The Genesis of a Fragmented Nationalism'', 3rd ed. p. 54 New York, Oxford University Press 1990.</ref> This action, known as the ''Devastaciones de Osorio'', proved disastrous; more than half of the resettled colonists died of starvation or disease, over 100,000 cattle were abandoned, and many slaves escaped.<ref>''Rough Guide to the Dominican Republic'', p. 352.</ref> Five of the existing thirteen settlements on the island were brutally razed by Spanish troops including the two settlements on the territory of present-day Haiti, La Yaguana, and Bayaja.

In 1697, after decades of fighting over the territory, the Spanish ceded the western\npart of the island to the French, who henceforth called it Saint-Domingue. Saint-Domingue developed into a highly lucrative colony for France. Its economy was based on a labor-intensive sugar industry which rested on vast numbers of African slaves. Meanwhile, the situation on the Spanish part of the island deteriorated. The entire Spanish empire sank into a deep economic crisis, and Santo Domingo was in addition struck by earthquakes, hurricanes and a shrinking population.\n\n==French Saint-Domingue (1625\u20131789)==\n{{Main|Saint-Domingue}}\n\n===The Pearl of the Antilles (1711\u201389)===\n[[File:D072- une sucrerie \u00e0 saint-domingue - Liv3-Ch16.png|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[sugar mill]] in Haiti (''L\u2019Homme et la Terre'' by [[\u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus]], 1830\u20131905)]]\n[[File:Cap_Fran\u00e7ais_-_Gravure_ancienne_-_1728.jpg|thumb|Engraving of [[Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]] in 1728]]\n\nIn 1711, the city of [[Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]] was formally established by [[Louis XIV]] and took over as capital of the colony from [[Port-de-Paix]]. In 1726, the city of [[Les Cayes]] was founded on the Southern coast which became the biggest settlement in the south. In 1749, the city of [[Port-au-Prince]] was established on the West coast, which in 1770 took over as the capital of the colony from Cap-Fran\u00e7ais, however that same year the [[1770 Port-au-Prince earthquake]] and tsunami destroyed the city killing 200 people immediately, and 30,000 later from famine and disease brought on by the natural disaster. This was the second major earthquake to hit Saint-Domingue as it followed the [[1751 Port-au-Prince earthquake]] which had left only a single stone built building standing in the town.\n\nPrior to the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u201363), the economy of Saint-Domingue gradually expanded, with sugar and, later, coffee becoming important export crops. After the war, which disrupted maritime commerce, the colony underwent rapid expansion. In 1767, it exported 72&nbsp;million pounds of [[raw sugar]] and 51&nbsp;million pounds of refined sugar, one million pounds of indigo, and two million pounds of cotton.<ref>{{cite book |first=CLR |last=James |title=The Black Jacobins |url=https://archive.org/details/blackjacobinstou00jame |url-access=registration |publisher=Vintage Books |place=New York |year=1963 |page=[https://archive.org/details/blackjacobinstou00jame/page/45 45]}}</ref> Saint-Domingue became known as the \"Pearl of the [[Antilles]]\" \u2013 the richest colony in the 18th century [[French colonial empire|French empire]]. By the 1780s, Saint-Domingue produced about 40 percent of all the sugar and 60 percent of all the coffee consumed in Europe. This single colony, roughly the size of [[Hawaii]] or [[Belgium]], produced more sugar and coffee than all of [[British West Indies|Britain's West Indian colonies]] combined.\n\nIn the second half of the 1780s, Saint-Domingue accounted for a third of the entire [[Atlantic slave trade]].  The population of the African slaves imported for these plantations is estimated to have been 790,000.  Between 1764 and 1771, the average importation of slaves varied between 10,000\u201315,000, by 1786 about 28,000, and, from 1787 onward, the colony received more than 40,000 slaves a year. However, the inability to maintain slave numbers without constant resupply from Africa meant the slave population, by 1789, totaled 500,000,{{non sequitur|date=February 2020}} ruled over by a white population that, by 1789, numbered only 32,000.<ref>{{cite book |first=CLR |last=James |title=The Black Jacobins |page=55}}</ref> At all times, a majority of slaves in the colony were African-born, as the brutal conditions of slavery prevented the population from experiencing growth through natural increase [https://web.archive.org/web/20060617033237/http://www.africanaonline.com/slavery_colonial_era.htm]. African culture thus remained strong among slaves to the end of French rule, in particular the folk-religion of [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]], which commingled Catholic liturgy and ritual with the beliefs and practices of [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]], [[Kingdom of Kongo|Congo]], and [[Dahomey]].<ref>Vodou is a Dahomean word meaning 'god' or 'spirit</ref> Slave traders scoured the Atlantic coast of Africa, and the slaves who arrived came from hundreds of different tribes, their languages often mutually incomprehensible.\n\n[[File:Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re Aerial View.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re]], built by [[Henri Christophe]], is the largest [[fortress]] in the Americas.]]\nTo regularize slavery, in 1685 [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] enacted the ''[[Code Noir]]'', which accorded certain human rights to slaves and responsibilities to the master, who was obliged to feed, clothe, and provide for the general well-being of their slaves. The ''code noir'' also sanctioned corporal punishment, allowing masters to employ brutal methods to instill in their slaves the necessary docility, while ignoring provisions intended to regulate the administration of punishments. A passage from [[Henri Christophe]]'s personal secretary, who lived more than half his life as a slave, describes the crimes perpetrated against the slaves of Saint-Domingue by their French masters:\n\n{{quote|\nHave they not hung up men with heads downward, drowned them in sacks, crucified them on planks, buried them alive, crushed them in mortars?

Have they not thrown them into boiling cauldrons of cane syrup? Have they not put men and women inside barrels studded with spikes and rolled them down mountainsides into the abyss?

The most famous was [[Fran\u00e7ois Mackandal|Mackandal]], a one-armed slave, originally from [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]], who escaped in 1751. A [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] Houngan (priest), he united many of the different maroon bands. He spent the next six years staging successful raids and evading capture by the French, reputedly killing over 6,000 people, while preaching a fanatic vision of the destruction of white civilization in St. Domingue. In 1758, after a failed plot to poison the drinking water of the plantation owners, he was captured and burned alive at the public square in Cap-Fran\u00e7ais.\n\nSaint-Domingue also had the largest and wealthiest [[free people of color|free population of color]] in the [[History of the Caribbean|Caribbean]], the ''[[gens de couleur]]'' (French, \"people of color\"). The mixed-race community in Saint-Domingue numbered 25,000 in 1789. First-generation gens de couleur were typically the offspring of a male, French slaveowner and an African slave chosen as a concubine. In the French colonies, the semi-official institution of \"[[pla\u00e7age]]\" defined this practice. By this system, the children were free people and could inherit property, thus originating a class of \"mulattos\" with property and some with wealthy fathers. This class occupied a middle status between African slaves and French colonists. Africans who attained freedom also enjoyed status as gens de couleur.\n\nAs numbers of ''gens de couleur'' grew, the French rulers enacted discriminatory laws. Statutes forbade ''gens de couleur'' from taking up certain professions, marrying whites, wearing European clothing, carrying swords or firearms in public, or attending social functions where whites were present. However, these regulations did not restrict their purchase of land, and many accumulated substantial holdings and became slave-owners. By 1789, they owned one-third of the plantation property and one-quarter of the slaves of [[Saint-Domingue]].<ref>{{cite book |publisher=GMU |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap8a.html |title=Revolution |chapter=8 |page=1 |access-date=14 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105214459/http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap8a.html |archive-date=5 November 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Central to the rise of the ''gens de couleur'' planter class was the growing importance of coffee, which thrived on the marginal hillside plots to which they were often relegated. The largest concentration of ''gens de couleur'' was in the southern peninsula, the last region of the colony to be settled, owing to its distance from Atlantic shipping lanes and its formidable terrain, with the highest mountain range in the Caribbean.\n\n==Revolutionary period (1789\u20131804)==\n[[File:Toussaint L'Ouverture.jpg|thumb|As unofficial leader of the revolution, [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] is considered the father of Haiti.]]\n{{Main|Haitian Revolution}}\n\n===Og\u00e9's revolt (1789\u201391)===\nThe outbreak of [[French Revolution|revolution in France]] in the summer of 1789 had a powerful effect on the colony. While the French settlers debated how new revolutionary laws would apply to Saint-Domingue, outright civil war broke out in 1790 when the free men of color claimed they too were French citizens under the terms of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]. Ten days before the fall of the [[Bastille]], in July 1789, the French [[National Assembly]] had voted to seat six delegates from Saint-Domingue. In Paris, a group of wealthy mulattoes, led by [[Julien Raimond]] and [[Vincent Og\u00e9]], unsuccessfully petitioned the white planter delegates to support mulatto claims for full civil and political rights. Through the efforts of a group called [[Society of the Friends of the Blacks|''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Amis des Noirs'']], of which Raimond and Og\u00e9 were prominent leaders, in March 1790 the [[National Assembly]] granted full civic rights to the ''gens de couleur.''\nVincent Og\u00e9 traveled to St. Domingue to secure the promulgation and implementation of this decree, landing near Cap-Fran\u00e7ais (now [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]]) in October 1790 and petitioning the royal governor, the Comte de Peynier. After his demands were refused, he attempted to incite the ''gens de couleur'' to revolt. Og\u00e9 and [[Jean-Baptiste Chavannes|Jean-Baptiste Chavennes]], a veteran of the [[Siege of Savannah]] during the [[American Revolution]], attempted to attack Cap-Fran\u00e7ais. However, the mulatto rebels refused to arm or free their slaves, or to challenge the status of slavery, and their attack was defeated by a force of white militia and black volunteers (including [[Henri Christophe]]). Afterwards, they fled across the frontier to [[Hinche]], at the time in the Spanish part of the island. However, they were captured, returned to the French authorities, and both Og\u00e9 and Chavennes were executed in February 1791.\n\n===The rising of the slaves (1791\u201393)===\n[[File:Incendie_de_la_Plaine_du_Cap._-_Massacre_des_Blancs_par_les_Noirs._FRANCE_MILITAIRE._-_Martinet_del._-_Masson_Sculp_-_33.jpg|thumb|\"Burning of the Plaine du Cap \u2013 Massacre of whites by the blacks\". On August 22, 1791, slaves set fire to plantations, torched cities and massacred the white population.]]\nOn 14 August 1791, slaves in the northern region of the colony staged a revolt that began the [[Haitian Revolution]]. Tradition marks the beginning of the revolution at a [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]] ceremony at [[Bois Ca\u00efman]] (Alligator Woods) near Cap-Fran\u00e7ais. The call to arms was issued by a [[Houngan]] (Vodou priest) named [[Dutty Boukman]]. Within hours, the northern plantations were in flames. The rebellion spread through the entire colony. Boukman was captured and executed, but the rebellion continued to spread rapidly.\n\nIn 1792, [[L\u00e9ger-F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Sonthonax]] was sent to the colony by the French Legislative Assembly as part of the Revolutionary Commission. His main goal was to maintain French control of Saint-Domingue, stabilize the colony, and enforce the social equality recently granted to free people of color by the National Convention of France.\n\n===Toussaint Louverture ascendant (1793\u20131802)===\n[[File:Vue_de_l%27incendie_de_la_ville_du_cap_fran\u00e7ais_f1.highres.jpg|thumb|Fire of [[Cap Fran\u00e7ais]], 21 June 1793]]\n[[Image:Andr\u00e9 Rigaud.gif|thumb|Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]]\n{{main|:s:Constitution of Saint-Domingue}}\n\nOn 29 August 1793, Sonthonax took the radical step of proclaiming the freedom of the slaves in the north province (with severe limits on their freedom). In September and October, emancipation was extended throughout the colony. The French National Convention, the first elected Assembly of the [[French First Republic|First Republic]] (1792\u20131804), on 4 February 1794, under the leadership of [[Maximilien de Robespierre]], abolished slavery by law in France and all its colonies. The constitution of 1793, which was never applied, and the constitution of 1795, which was put into effect, did both contain an explicit ban on slavery.\n\nThe slaves did not immediately flock to Sonthonax's banner, however. White colonists continued to fight Sonthonax, with assistance from the British. They were joined by many of the free men of color who opposed the abolition of slavery. It was not until word of France's ratification of emancipation arrived back in the colony that [[Toussaint Louverture]] and his corps of well disciplined, battle-hardened former slaves came over to the French Republican side in early May 1794. A change in the political winds in France caused Sonthonax to be recalled in 1796, but not before taking the step of arming the former slaves.\n\nWhen the radical revolutionaries in Paris declared war against Spain in January 1793, the Spanish Crown sent its forces in [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] into battle on the side of the slaves. By the end of 1793, Spain controlled most of the north, except British-held M\u00f4le-Saint-Nicolas and French-held Le Cap Fran\u00e7ois and Port-de-Paix.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Haitian Revolution, 1789-1804|date=1973|publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press|page=79}}</ref> In 1795, Spain ceded Santo Domingo to France and Spanish attacks on Saint-Domingue ceased.\n\nIn the south the British suffered a series of defeats at the hands of the mulatto General [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]]. On October 6, 1794, Rigaud took L\u00e9ogane. On December 26, 1794, he attacked the British-held Tiburon, routing and decimating the British garrison along with black troops under the command of Jean Kina fighting with them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution|date=2009|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|page=182}}</ref> In 1798, having lost territory and thousands of men, the British were forced to withdraw.\n\nIn the meantime, Rigaud had set up a mulatto separatist movement in the south and [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion|P\u00e9tion]] had joined him. With the British out, Toussaint swung into action against them. As he sent General [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]] against Grand and Petit Go\u00e2ve and General [[Henri Christophe|Christophe]] against the mulatto stronghold of Jacmel, heavily armed American ships bombarded mulatto fortifications and destroyed Rigaud's transport barges.<ref>{{cite book|title=The American Counterrevolution: A Retreat from Liberty, 1783-1800|date=1998|publisher=Stackpole Books|page=485}}</ref> The display of American force and the fierce fighting of Toussaint's troops brought victory.\n\nBy 1801, Toussaint was in control of all of Hispaniola, after conquering [[Era de Francia|French Santo Domingo]] and proclaiming the abolition of slavery there. He did not, however, proclaim full independence for the country, nor did he seek reprisals against the country's former white slaveholders, convinced that the French would not restore slavery and \"that a population of slaves recently landed from Africa could not attain to civilization by 'going it alone.'\"<ref>{{cite book |first=CLR |last=James |title=The Black Jacobins |publisher=Vintage Books |place=New York |year=1990 |page=290}}</ref>\n\n===Napoleon defeated (1802\u201304)===\n[[File:Prise du Cap Fran\u00e7ais par G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Le Clerc 15 et 20 Pluviose, An 10 (Nuevo).jpg|thumb|The French army led by Le Clerc lands in [[Cap Fran\u00e7ais]] (1802)]]\n[[File:Haitian revolution.jpg|thumb|Leclerc's veterans [[Battle of Ravine-\u00e0-Couleuvres|storm Ravine-a-Couleuvre]] (Snake Gully) in 1802.]]\n[[File:Battle for Palm Tree Hill.jpg|thumb|''Battle for Santo Domingo'', by [[January Suchodolski]] (1845)]]\n<!--[[File:Haitian_Revolution.jpg|thumb|Attack and take of the [[Cr\u00eate-\u00e0-Pierrot]].

For a time, Leclerc met with some success; he also brought the eastern part of the island of Hispaniola under the direct control of France in accordance with the terms of the 1795 [[Peace of Basel|Treaties of B\u00e2le]] with Spain. With a large expedition that eventually included 40,000 European troops, and receiving help from white colonists and mulatto forces commanded by [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion]], a former lieutenant of Rigaud, the French won several victories after severe fighting. Two of Toussaint's chief lieutenants, Dessalines and Christophe, recognizing their untenable situation, held separate parleys with the invaders, and agreed to transfer their allegiance. At this point, Leclerc invited Toussaint to negotiate a settlement. It was a deception; Toussaint was seized and deported to France, where he died of [[pneumonia]] while imprisoned at [[Fort de Joux]] in the [[Jura Mountains]] in April 1803.\n\nOn 20 May 1802, Napoleon signed a law to maintain slavery where it had not yet disappeared, namely [[Martinique]], [[Tobago]], and [[Saint Lucia]]. A confidential copy of this decree was sent to Leclerc, who was authorized to restore slavery in Saint-Domingue when the time was opportune. At the same time, further edicts stripped the ''gens de couleur'' of their newly won civil rights. None of these decrees were published or executed in St. Domingue, but, by midsummer, word began to reach the colony of the French intention to restore slavery. The betrayal of Toussaint and news of French actions in Martinique undermined the collaboration of leaders such as [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]], [[Henri Christophe|Christophe]], and [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion|P\u00e9tion]]. Convinced that the same fate lay in store for Saint-Domingue, these commanders and others once again battled Leclerc. With the French intent on reconquest and re-enslavement of the colony's black population, the war became a bloody struggle of atrocity and attrition. The rainy season brought [[yellow fever]] and [[malaria]], which took a heavy toll on the invaders. By November, when Leclerc died of yellow fever, 24,000 French soldiers were dead and 8,000 were hospitalized, the majority from disease.<ref>{{cite book |first=CLR |last=James |title=Black Jacobins |page=355}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Leclerc was replaced by [[Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau]]. Rochambeau wrote to Napoleon that, to reclaim Saint-Domingue, France must 'declare the negroes slaves, and destroy at least 30,000 negroes and negresses.'<ref>{{cite book |first=CLR |last=James |title=Black Jacobins |page=360}}</ref> In his desperation, he turned to increasingly wanton acts of brutality; the French burned alive, hanged, drowned, and tortured black prisoners, reviving such practices as burying blacks in piles of insects and boiling them in cauldrons of molasses. One night, at Port-R\u00e9publican, he held a ball to which he invited the most prominent mulatto ladies and, at midnight, announced the death of their husbands. However, each act of brutality was repaid by the Haitian rebels. After one battle, Rochambeau buried 500 prisoners alive; Dessalines responded by hanging 500 French prisoners.<ref>{{harvnb|Heinl|1996|pp=108\u20139}}</ref> Rochambeau's brutal tactics helped unite black, mulatto, and mestizo soldiers against the French.\n\nAs the tide of the war turned toward the former slaves, Napoleon abandoned his dreams of restoring France's New World empire. In 1803, war resumed between France and Britain, and with the [[Royal Navy]] firmly in control of the seas, reinforcements and supplies for Rochambeau never arrived in sufficient numbers. To concentrate on the war in Europe, Napoleon signed the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in April, selling France's North American possessions to the United States. The Haitian army, now led by Dessalines, devastated Rochembeau and the French army at the [[Battle of Verti\u00e8res]] on 18 November 1803.\n\nOn 1 January 1804 Dessalines then declared independence,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/dol/images/examples/haiti/0001.pdf |publisher=National archives |place=UK |title=D\u00e9claration d'ind\u00e9pendance}}</ref> reclaiming the indigenous Ta\u00edno name of Haiti (\"Land of Mountains\") for the new nation. Most of the remaining French colonists fled ahead of the defeated French army, many migrating to [[Louisiana]] or [[Cuba]]. Unlike Toussaint, Dessalines showed little equanimity with regard to the whites. In a final act of retribution, [[1804 Haiti massacre|the remaining French were slaughtered by Haitian military forces]]. Some 2,000 Frenchmen were massacred at Cap-Fran\u00e7ais, 900 in Port-au-Prince, and 400 at J\u00e9r\u00e9mie.

At the time, there was a familiar situation going on back in their homeland, as these Polish soldiers were fighting for their liberty from the invading Russia, Prussia and Austria that began in 1772. As hopeful as the Haitians, many Poles were seeking union amongst themselves to win back their homeland. As a result, many Polish soldiers admired their enemy and decided to turn on the French army and join the [[Haiti]]an slaves, and participated in the Haitian revolution of 1804, supporting the principles of liberty for all the people. [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Franciszek Jab\u0142onowski]] who was half-Black was one of the Polish generals at the time. Polish soldiers had a remarkable input in helping the Haitians in the retaliation fights against the French oppressor. They were spared the fate of other Europeans. For their loyalty and support for overthrowing the French, some Poles acquired Haitian citizenship after Haiti gained its Independence, and many of them settled there to never return to [[Poland]]. It is estimated that around 500 of the 5280 Poles chose this option. Of the remainder, 700 returned to France to eventually return to Poland, and some \u2013 after capitulation \u2013 were forced to serve in British units.<ref name=\"North\" /> 160 Poles were later given permission to leave Haiti and some particular ones were sent to France at Haitian expense. To this day, many Polish Haitians still live in Haiti and are of [[Mulatto|mixed racial origin]], however some have blonde hair, light eyes, and other European features. Today, descendants of those Poles who stayed are living in [[Cazale]], [[Fond-des-Blancs]], [[La Vall\u00e9e-de-Jacmel]], [[La Baleine]], [[Port-Salut]] and [[Saint-Jean-du-Sud]].<ref name=\"North\" />\n\nDespite the Haitian victory, France refused to recognize the newly independent country's sovereignty until 1825, in exchange for 150&nbsp;million gold francs.

Furthermore, owing to entrenched opposition from Southern slave states, Haiti did not receive U.S. diplomatic recognition until 1862 (after those states had seceded from the Union) \u2013 largely through the efforts of anti-slavery senator [[Charles Sumner]] of Massachusetts.\n\nUpon assuming power, General Dessalines authorized the Constitution of 1804. This constitution, in terms of social freedoms, called for:\n# Freedom of religion (Under Toussaint, Catholicism had been declared the official state religion);\n# All citizens of Haiti, regardless of skin color, to be known as \"Black\" (this was an attempt to eliminate the multi-tiered racial hierarchy that had developed in Haiti, with full or near full-blooded Europeans at the top, various levels of light to brown skin in the middle, and dark skinned \"Kongo\" from Africa at the bottom).\n# White men were forbidden from possessing property or domain on Haitian soil.

Yet two of his own advisers, [[Henri Christophe]] and [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion]], helped provoke his assassination in 1806. The conspirators ambushed him north of [[Port-au-Prince]] at Pont Larnage (now known as Pont-Rouge) on 17 October 1806 en route to battle rebels to his regime.\n\nThe state created under Dessalines was the opposite of what the Haitian mass or the peasantry preferred. While both the elite leaders, such as Dessalines, as well as the Haitian population agreed the state should be built on the ideals of freedom and democracy,<ref>Jean-Jaques Dessalines, Haitian Declaration of Independence, 1804.

The leaders of Haiti tied independence from other powers as their notion of freedom.\n\nHowever, the Haitian peasantry tied their notion of freedom to the land. Because of the mountainous terrain, Haitian slaves were able to cultivate their own small tracts of land. Thus, freedom for them was the ability to cultivate their own land within a subsistence economy. Unfortunately, because of the leaders\u2019 desires, a system of coerced plantation agriculture emerged.<ref>James Franklin, the Present State of Hayti with remarks on its agriculture, commerce, laws, religion, finances and population (Connecticut: Negro Universities Press, 1828), 189-190.</ref> Furthermore, while all Haitians desired a black republic,<ref name=\"faculty.webster.edu\"/> the cultural practices of African-Americans were a point of contention. Many within the Haitian population wanted to maintain their African heritage, which is a logical connection to wanting a black republic. However, the elites typically tried to prove the sophistication of Haitians through literature. Some authors wrote that the barbarism of Africa must be expelled, while maintaining African roots.<ref>Beaubrun Ardouin, Etudes sur l\u2019historie d\u2019Haiti : suivies de la vie du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral J.M.

Quoted in Erin Zavitz, \"Revolutionary narrations: Early Haitian historiography and the challenge of writing counter-history,\" Atlantic Studies, 14, no. 3 (2017), 343.</ref> Furthermore, to maintain freedom and independence, the elites failed to provide a civil society that the Haitian mass desired. The Haitian peasants desired not only land freedom but also civil rights, such as voting and political participation as well as access to education.<ref name=\"Mimi Sheller 2000\"/> The state failed to provide those basic rights.\n\nThe state was essentially run by the military, which meant that it was very difficult for the Haitian population to participate in democratic processes. Most importantly, the state failed to provide proper access to education that a state consisting of former slaves would need.<ref>M.B. Bird, the Black Man or Haytian Independence (New York: Published by Author, 1869), 220.</ref> It was nearly impossible for the former slaves to participate effectively because they lacked the basic literacy that was intentionally denied to them by French colonial rule. Through differing views on Haitian nationalism and freedom, the elites created a state that greatly favored them, over the Haitian population and the Haitian peasantry.\n\n===The struggle for unity (1806\u201320)===\n[[File:Duckworth's Action off San Domingo, 6 February 1806.jpg|thumb|The [[battle of Santo Domingo]] (1806) painted by \t\nNicholas Pocock in 1808]]\n\nAfter the Dessalines coup d'\u00e9tat, the two main conspirators divided the country in two rival regimes. Christophe created the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[State of Haiti]] in the north, and the [[Gens de couleur]] P\u00e9tion helped establish the [[Haiti|Republic of Haiti]] in the south. Christophe attempted to maintain a strict system of labor and agricultural production akin to the former plantations. Although, strictly speaking, he did not establish slavery, he imposed a semi-feudal system, fumage, in which every able man was required to work in plantations (similar to [[Latifundia|latifundios]]) to produce goods for the fledgling country. His method, though undoubtedly oppressive, produced the most revenues of the two governments.\n\nBy contrast, P\u00e9tion broke up the former colonial estates and parceled out the land into small holdings. In P\u00e9tion's south, the [[gens de couleur]] minority led the government and feared losing popular support, and thus, sought to assuage class tensions with land redistribution. Because of the weak international position and its labor policies (most peasants lived through a subsistence economy), P\u00e9tion's government was perpetually on the brink of bankruptcy. Yet, for most of its time, it produced one of the most liberal and tolerant Haitian governments ever. In 1815, at a key period of [[Military career of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar's fight for Venezuelan independence]], he gave the Venezuelan leader [[right of asylum|asylum]] and provided him soldiers and substantial material support. It also had the least of internal military skirmishes, despite its continuous conflicts with Christophe's northern kingdom. In 1816, however, after finding the burden of the [[Senate]] intolerable, he suspended the legislature and turned his post into [[President for Life]]. Not long after, he died of [[yellow fever]], and his assistant [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]] replaced him.\n\n[[File:Kingdom of Haiti.jpg|thumbnail|The Kingdom of Haiti in the North and the Republic of Haiti in the South]]\nIn this period, the eastern part of the island rose against the new powers following general Juan S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez's claims of independence from France, which broke the Treaties of B\u00e2le attacking Spain and prohibited commerce with Haiti. In the Palo Hincado battle (7 November 1808), all the remaining French forces were defeated by Spanish-creole insurrectionists. On 9 July 1809, Santo Domingo was born. The government put itself under the control of Spain, earning it the nickname of \"Espa\u00f1a Boba\" (meaning \"The Idiot Spain\").\n\nIn 1811, Christophe proclaimed himself King Henri I in the North and commissioned several extraordinary buildings. He even created a nobility class in the fashion of European monarchies. Yet in 1820, weakened by illness and with a decreasing support for his authoritarian regime, he killed himself with a silver bullet rather than face a coup d'\u00e9tat. Immediately after, P\u00e9tion's successor, Boyer, reunited Haiti through diplomatic tactics, and ruled as president until his overthrow in 1843.\n\n===Boyer's domination of Hispaniola (1820\u201343)===\n{{main|Unification of Hispaniola}}\n[[File:President_Jean-Pierre_Boyer_of_Haiti_(Hispaniola_Unification_Regime)_Portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Pierre Boyer]]]]\n\nAlmost two years after Boyer had consolidated power in the west, in 1821, Santo Domingo declared independence from Spain and requested from Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar inclusion in the [[Gran Colombia]]. Boyer, however, responding to a party on the east that preferred Haiti over Colombia, occupied the ex-Spanish colony in January 1822, encountering no military resistance. In this way he accomplished the unity of the island, which was only carried out for a short period of time by [[Toussaint Louverture]] in 1801. Boyer's occupation of the Spanish side also responded to internal struggles among Christophe's generals, to which Boyer gave extensive powers and lands in the east. This occupation, however, pitted the Spanish white elite against the iron fisted Haitian administration, and stimulated the emigration of many white wealthy families. The entire island remained under Haitian rule until 1844, when in the east a nationalist group called [[La Trinitaria (Dominican Republic)|La Trinitaria]] led a revolt that partitioned the island into [[Haiti]] on the west and [[Dominican Republic]] on the east, based on what would appear to be a riverine territorial 'divide' from the pre-contact period.\n\nFrom 1824 to 1826, while the island was under one government, Boyer promoted the largest single [[Haitian emigration|free-Black immigration]] from the [[Thomas Jefferson and Haitian Emigration|United States]] in which more than 6,000 immigrants settled in different parts of the island. Today remnants of these immigrants live throughout the island, but the larger number reside in [[Saman\u00e1 Peninsula|Saman\u00e1]], a peninsula on the Dominican side of the island. From the government's perspective, the intention of the immigration was to help establish commercial and diplomatic relationships with the US, and to increase the number of skilled and agricultural workers in Haiti.\n\n[[File:Sans Souci Palace.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the [[Sans-Souci Palace]], severely damaged in the 1842 earthquake and never rebuilt]]\nIn exchange for diplomatic recognition from France, Boyer was forced to pay a huge indemnity for the loss of French property during the revolution. To pay for this, he had to float loans in France, putting Haiti into a state of debt. Boyer attempted to enforce production through the ''Code Rural'', enacted in 1826, but peasant freeholders, mostly former revolutionary soldiers, had no intention of returning to the forced labor they fought to escape. By 1840, Haiti had ceased to export sugar entirely, although large amounts continued to be grown for local consumption as ''taffia''-a raw rum. However, Haiti continued to export coffee, which required little cultivation and grew semi-wild.\n\nThe [[1842 Cap-Ha\u00eftien earthquake]] destroyed the city, and the [[Sans-Souci Palace]], killing 10,000 people. This was the third major earthquake to hit Western Hispaniola following the 1751 and 1770 Port-au-Prince earthquakes, and the last until the devastating earthquake of 2010.\n\nHaiti went through a long period of oppression and instability following the presidency of Jean-Pierre Boyer. Likewise, in the Dominican Republic, a succession of [[caudillo|strongmen]] ruled harshly during the last half of the 19th century, crushed frequent uprisings, and repelled Haitian invasions.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Kohn|editor1-first=George Childs|title=Dictionary of Wars|date=2013|publisher=Routledge}}</ref>\n\n==Political struggles (1843\u20131915)==\n[[File:Sacre de l'empereur Faustin Soulouque.jpg|thumb|The coronation of [[Faustin I of Haiti]] in 1849]]\n\n[[File:Palais-National incendi\u00e9 par Salnave.jpg|thumb|The National Palace burned down during the revolt against Salnave in 1868]]\n\n[[File:Haiti German legation 1900.jpg|thumb|Staff of the German legation and the Hamburg-Amerika Line agency at Port-au-Prince, Haiti in 1900.

Revolts soon broke out and the country descended into near chaos, with a series of transient presidents until March 1847, when General [[Faustin I of Haiti|Faustin Soulouque]], a former slave who had fought in the rebellion of 1791, became president. He purged the military high command, established a secret police, and eliminated mulatto opponents. In August 1849, he grandiosely proclaimed himself as Haiti's second emperor, Faustin I. Soulouque's expansive ambitions led him to mount several invasions of the Dominican Republic. The new emperor had been called a ''rey de farsa'' by the Dominicans. The white and mulatto rulers of the Dominican Republic he considered as his \"natural\" enemies, and he could never consolidate his rule without this conquest, for his reign had been founded on domination and would stand only by it.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baur|first1=John E.|title=Faustin Soulouque, Emperor of Haiti His Character and His Reign|date=1949|page=143}}</ref> When in 1849 Soulouque led his first invasion into the Dominican Republic, President [[Buenaventura B\u00e1ez]] declared war on Haiti.

In January of the following year, a Haitian contingent of 6,000 soldiers was terribly defeated in the border town of Ouanaminthe.

When he rode into Port-au-Prince with what remained of his army he was loudly cursed by women who had lost their sons, brothers, and husbands in the war.<ref name=Smith/> Four years later, he was deposed by General [[Fabre Geffrard]], styled the Duke of Tabara.\n\nGeffrard's military government held office until 1867, and he encouraged a successful policy of national reconciliation. In 1860, he reached an agreement with the [[Roman Catholic Church|Vatican]], reintroducing official Roman Catholic institutions, including schools, to the nation. In 1867 an attempt was made to establish a constitutional government, but successive presidents [[Sylvain Salnave]] and [[Nissage Saget]] were overthrown in 1869 and 1874 respectively. A more workable constitution was introduced under [[Michel Domingue]] in 1874, leading to a long period of democratic peace and development for Haiti. The debt to France was finally repaid in 1879, and Michel Domingue's government peacefully transferred power to [[Lysius Salomon]], one of Haiti's abler leaders. Monetary reform and a cultural renaissance ensued with a flowering of Haitian art.\n\nThe last two decades of the 19th century were also marked by the development of a Haitian intellectual culture. Major works of history were published in 1847 and 1865. Haitian intellectuals, led by [[Louis-Joseph Janvier]] and [[Ant\u00e9nor Firmin]], engaged in a war of letters against a tide of racism and [[Social Darwinism]] that emerged during this period.\n\nThe Constitution of 1867 saw peaceful and progressive transitions in government that did much to improve the economy and stability of the Haitian nation and the condition of its people. Constitutional government restored the faith of the Haitian people in legal institutions. The development of industrial sugar and rum industries near [[Port-au-Prince]] made Haiti, for a while, a model for economic growth in Latin American countries.\nThis period of relative stability and prosperity ended in 1911, when revolution broke out and the country slid once again into disorder and debt.\n\nFrom 1911 to 1915, there were six different presidents, each of whom was killed or forced into exile.<ref>{{harvnb|Heinl|1996|p=791}}</ref> The revolutionary armies were formed by ''cacos'', peasant brigands from the mountains of the north, along the porous Dominican border, who were enlisted by rival political factions with promises of money to be paid after a successful revolution and an opportunity to plunder.\n\nThe United States was particularly apprehensive about the role of the German community in Haiti (approximately 200 in 1910), who wielded a disproportionate amount of economic power. Germans controlled about 80% of the country's international commerce; they also owned and operated utilities in Cap Ha\u00eftien and Port-au-Prince, the main [[wharf]] and a tramway in the capital, and a railroad serving the Plaine de Cul-du-Sac.\n\nThe German community proved more willing to integrate into Haitian society than any other group of white foreigners, including the French. A number married into the nation's most prominent mulatto families, bypassing the constitutional prohibition against foreign land-ownership. They also served as the principal financiers of the nation's innumerable revolutions, floating innumerable loans-at high interest rates-to competing political factions.\n\nIn an effort to limit German influence, in 1910\u201311, the US State Department backed a consortium of American investors, assembled by the [[Citibank|National City Bank of New York]], in acquiring control of the ''Banque Nationale d'Ha\u00efti'', the nation's only commercial bank and the government treasury.\n\nIn February 1915, [[Vilbrun Guillaume Sam]] established a dictatorship, but in July, facing a new revolt, he massacred 167 political prisoners, all of whom were from elite families, and was lynched by a mob in [[Port-au-Prince]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Fabre Geffrard (President d'Haiti 1859-1867).jpg|[[Fabre Geffrard]]\nFile:Charles Rivi\u00e8re-H\u00e9rard.jpg|[[Charles Rivi\u00e8re-H\u00e9rard]]\nFile:Michel Domingue (President d'Haiti 1874-1876).jpg|[[Michel Domingue]]\nFile:Salomon 200.jpg|[[Lysius Salomon]]\n</gallery>\n\n==United States occupation (1915\u201334)==\n{{See also|United States occupation of Haiti}}\n[[File:Occupation of Haiti.jpg|thumbnail|United States Marines and a Haitian guide patrolling the jungle in 1915 during the Battle of Fort Dipitie]]\n[[File:American Marines In 1915 defending the entrance gate in Cap-Haitian - 34510.jpg|thumb|American Marines in 1915 defending the entrance gate in Cap-Ha\u00eften]]\n[[File:Marines' base in Cap-Ha\u00eftien.jpg|thumb|Marine's base at Cap-Ha\u00eftien]]\n[[File:Inauguration du Mausol\u00e9e de P\u00e9tion et de Dessalines.jpg|thumb|Opening of the mausoleum of P\u00e9tion and Dessalines in 1926]]\n[[File:Bread market, St. Michel (Haiti) (15629128676).jpg|thumb|Bread market in St. Michel, 1928\u20131929]]\n\nIn 1915 the United States, responding to complaints to President [[Woodrow Wilson]] from American banks to which Haiti was deeply in debt, occupied the country. The [[United States occupation of Haiti|occupation of Haiti]] lasted until 1934. The US occupation was resented by Haitians as a loss of sovereignty and there were revolts against US forces. Reforms were carried out despite this.\n\nUnder the supervision of the United States Marines, the Haitian National Assembly elected [[Philippe Sudr\u00e9 Dartiguenave]] president. He signed a treaty that made Haiti a ''de jure'' US protectorate, with American officials assuming control over the Financial Advisory, Customs Receivership, the Constabulary, the Public Works Service, and the Public Health Service for a period of ten years. The principal instrument of American authority was the newly created ''Gendarmerie d'Ha\u00efti'', commanded by American officers. In 1917, at the demand of US officials, the National Assembly was dissolved, and officials were designated to write a new constitution, which was largely dictated by officials in the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] and [[United States Department of the Navy|US Navy Department]]. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Under-Secretary for the Navy in the [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] administration, claimed to have personally written the new constitution. This document abolished the prohibition on foreign ownership of land \u2013 the most essential component of Haitian law. When the newly elected National Assembly refused to pass this document and drafted one of its own preserving this prohibition, it was forcibly dissolved by ''Gendarmerie'' commandant [[Smedley Butler]]. This constitution was approved by a plebiscite in 1919, in which less than 5% of the population voted. The US State Department authorized this plebiscite presuming that \"the people casting ballots would be 97% illiterate, ignorant in most cases of what they were voting for.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Hans Schmidt |title=The United States Occupation of Haiti, 1915\u20131934 |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |year=1971 |isbn=9780813522036 |page=99 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThe Marines and ''Gendarmerie'' initiated an extensive road-building program to enhance their military effectiveness and open the country to US investment. Lacking any source of adequate funds, they revived an 1864 Haitian law, discovered by Butler, requiring peasants to perform labor on local roads in lieu of paying a road tax. This system, known as the [[corv\u00e9e]], originated in the unpaid labor that French peasants provided to their [[feudalism|feudal]] lords. In 1915, Haiti had {{convert|3|mi}} of road usable by automobile, outside the towns. By 1918, more than {{convert|470|mi|km}} of road had been built or repaired through the corv\u00e9e system, including a road linking [[Port-au-Prince]] to [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]].<ref>{{harvnb|Heinl|1996|pp=430}}</ref> However, Haitians forced to work in the corv\u00e9e labor-gangs, frequently dragged from their homes and harassed by armed guards, received few immediate benefits and saw this system of forced labor as a return to slavery at the hands of white men.\n\nIn 1919, a new ''caco'' uprising began, led by [[Charlemagne P\u00e9ralte]], vowing to 'drive the invaders into the sea and free Haiti.'<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Max Boot |last=Boot |first=Max |title=The Savage Wars of Peace: Small Wars and the Rise of American Power |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=046500721X |lccn=2004695066 |year=2003 |page=173}}</ref> The Cacos [[Battle of Port-au-Prince (1919)|attacked Port-au-Prince]] in October but were driven back with heavy casualties. Afterwards, a [[Haitian Creole language|Creole]]-speaking American ''Gendarmerie'' officer and two US marines infiltrated P\u00e9ralte's camp, killing him and photographing his corpse in an attempt to demoralize the rebels. Leadership of the rebellion passed to Beno\u00eet Batraville, a Caco chieftain from [[Artibonite (department)|Artibonite]], who also launched an [[Battle of Port-au-Prince (1920)|assault on the capital]]. His death in 1920 marked the end of hostilities. During Senate hearings in 1921, the commandant of the Marine Corps reported that, in the twenty months of active resistance, 2,250 Haitians had been killed. However, in a report to the Secretary of the Navy he reported the death toll as being 3,250.<ref>{{harvnb|Schmidt|1971|p=102}}</ref> Haitian historians have estimated the true number was much higher; one suggested, \"the total number of battle victims and casualties of repression and consequences of the war might have reached, by the end of the pacification period, four or five times that \u2013 somewhere in the neighborhood of 15,000 persons.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Farmer |authorlink=Paul Farmer |title=The Uses of Haiti |publisher=Common Courage Press |year=2003 |page=98}}</ref>\n\nIn 1922, Dartiguenave was replaced by [[Louis Borno]], who ruled without a legislature until 1930. That same year, General [[John H. Russell, Jr.]], was appointed High Commissioner. The Borno-Russel dictatorship oversaw the expansion of the economy, building over {{convert|1000|mi|km}} of road, establishing an automatic telephone exchange, modernizing the nation's port facilities, and establishing a public health service. [[Sisal]] was introduced to Haiti, and sugar and cotton became significant exports.<ref>{{harvnb|Heinl|1996|pp=454\u201355}}</ref> However, efforts to develop commercial agriculture had limited success, in part because much of Haiti's labor force was employed at seasonal work in the more established sugar industries of [[Cuba]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. An estimated 30,000\u201340,000 Haitian laborers, known as ''braceros'', went annually to the [[Oriente Province]] of Cuba between 1913 and 1931.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Bridget |last1=Woodling |first2=Richard |last2=Moseley-Williams |title=Needed but unwanted: Haitian Immigrants and their Descendants in the Dominican Republic |publisher=Catholic Institute for International Relations |place=London |year=2004 |page=24}}</ref> Most Haitians continued to resent the loss of sovereignty.

In December 1929, Marines in [[Les Cayes]] killed ten Haitians during a march to protest local economic conditions. This led [[Herbert Hoover]] to appoint two commissions, including one headed by a former US governor of the [[Philippines]] [[William Cameron Forbes]], which criticized the exclusion of Haitians from positions of authority in the government and constabulary, now known as the ''Garde d'Ha\u00efti''. In 1930, [[St\u00e9nio Vincent]], a long-time critic of the occupation, was elected president, and the US began to withdraw its forces. The withdrawal was completed under US President [[Franklin D.

The US retained control of Haiti's external finances until 1947.<ref>{{harvnb|Schmidt|1971|p=232}}</ref> All three rulers during the occupation came from the country's small [[mulatto]] minority.

The country had fully democratic elections in 1930, won by [[St\u00e9nio Vincent]]. The Garde was a new kind of military institution in Haiti. It was a force manned overwhelmingly by blacks, with a United States-trained black commander, Colonel D\u00e9mosth\u00e8nes P\u00e9trus Calixte. Most of the Garde's officers, however, were mulattoes. The Garde was a national organization;<ref name=oavommo /> it departed from the regionalism that had characterized most of Haiti's previous armies. In theory, its charge was apolitical\u2014to maintain internal order, while supporting a popularly elected government. The Garde initially adhered to this role.<ref name=oavommo>http://countrystudies.us/haiti/16.htm</ref>\n\n==Elections and coups (1934\u201357)==\n\n[[File:Stenio Vincent portrait.jpg|thumb|[[St\u00e9nio Vincent]]]]\n\n===Vincent's presidency (1934\u201341)===\nPresident Vincent took advantage of the comparative national stability, which was being maintained by a professionalized military, to gain absolute power. A plebiscite permitted the transfer of all authority in economic matters from the legislature to the executive, but Vincent was not content with this expansion of his power. In 1935 he forced through the legislature a new constitution, which was also approved by plebiscite. The constitution praised Vincent, and it granted the executive sweeping powers to dissolve the legislature at will, to reorganize the judiciary, to appoint ten of twenty-one senators (and to recommend the remaining eleven to the lower house), and to rule by decree when the legislature was not in session. Although Vincent implemented some improvements in infrastructure and services, he brutally repressed his opposition, censored the press, and governed largely to benefit himself and a clique of merchants and corrupt military officers.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nUnder Calixte the majority of Garde personnel had adhered to the doctrine of political nonintervention that their Marine Corps trainers had stressed. Over time, however, Vincent and Dominican dictator [[Rafael Trujillo|Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo Molina]] sought to buy adherents among the ranks. Trujillo, determined to expand his influence over all of Hispaniola, in October 1937 ordered the indiscriminate butchery by the Dominican army of an estimated 14,000 to 40,000<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barsamian |first1=David |title=Louder Than Bombs: Interviews from the Progressive Magazine |date=2004 |publisher=South End Press |page=3 |isbn=9780896087255 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zWQkIPrIAAsC&pg=PA3&lpg=#v=onepage}}</ref> Haitians on the Dominican side of the [[Dajab\u00f3n River|Massacre River]]. Some observers claim that Trujillo supported an abortive coup attempt by young Garde officers in December 1937. Vincent dismissed Calixte as commander and sent him abroad, where he eventually accepted a commission in the Dominican military as a reward for his efforts while on Trujillo's payroll. The attempted coup led Vincent to purge the officer corps of all members suspected of disloyalty,  marking the end of the apolitical military.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n===Lescot's presidency (1941\u201346)===\n\n[[File:Elie Lescot portrait.jpg |thumb|[[\u00c9lie Lescot]]]]\n\nIn 1941 Vincent showed every intention of standing for a third term as president, but after almost a decade of disengagement, the United States made it known that it would oppose such an extension. Vincent accommodated the Roosevelt administration and handed power over to [[Elie Lescot]].<ref name=oavommo />\n\nLescot was a mulatto who had served in numerous government posts. He was competent and forceful, and many considered him a sterling candidate for the presidency, despite his elitist background. Like the majority of previous Haitian presidents, however, he failed to live up to his potential. His tenure paralleled that of Vincent in many ways. Lescot declared himself commander in chief of the military, and power resided in a clique that ruled with the tacit support of the Garde. He repressed his opponents, censored the press, and compelled the legislature to grant him extensive powers. He handled all budget matters without legislative sanction and filled legislative vacancies without calling elections. Lescot commonly said that Haiti's declared state-of-war against the Axis powers during World War II justified his repressive actions. Haiti, however, played no role in the war except for supplying the United States with raw materials and serving as a base for a United States Coast Guard detachment.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nAside from his authoritarian tendencies, Lescot had another flaw: his relationship with [[Rafael Trujillo]]. While serving as Haitian ambassador to the [[Dominican Republic]], Lescot fell under the sway of Trujillo's influence and wealth. In fact, it was Trujillo's money that reportedly bought most of the legislative votes that brought Lescot to power. Their clandestine association persisted until 1943, when the two leaders parted ways for unknown reasons. Trujillo later made public all his correspondence with the Haitian leader. The move undermined Lescot's already dubious popular support.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nIn January 1946, events came to a head when Lescot jailed the Marxist editors of a journal called ''La Ruche'' (The Beehive). This action precipitated student strikes and protests by government workers, teachers, and shopkeepers in the capital and provincial cities. In addition, Lescot's mulatto-dominated rule had alienated the predominantly black Garde. His position became untenable, and he resigned on 11 January. Radio announcements declared that the Garde had assumed power, which it would administer through a three-member junta.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n===Revolution of 1946===\n[[File:\"TOGETHER AGAIN FOR FREEDOM^\" - NARA - 535669.tif|thumb|\"Together again for freedom\", 1943 U.S. leaflet]]\n\nThe Revolution of 1946 was a novel development in Haiti's history, as the Garde assumed power as an institution, not as the instrument of a particular commander. The members of the junta, known as the Military Executive Committee (Comit\u00e9 Ex\u00e9cutif Militaire), were Garde commander [[Franck Lavaud|Colonel Franck Lavaud]], [[Antoine Levelt|Major Antoine Levelt]], and [[Paul E. Magloire|Major Paul E. Magloire]], commander of the Presidential Guard. All three understood Haiti's traditional way of exercising power, but they lacked a thorough understanding of what would be required to make the transition to an elected civilian government. Upon taking power, the junta pledged to hold free elections. The junta also explored other options, but public clamor, which included public demonstrations in support of potential candidates, eventually forced the officers to make good on their promise.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nHaiti elected its National Assembly in May 1946. The Assembly set 16 August 1946, as the date on which it would select a president. The leading candidates for the office\u2014all of whom were black\u2014were [[Dumarsais Estim\u00e9]], a former school teacher, assembly member, and cabinet minister under Vincent; [[F\u00e9lix d'Orl\u00e9ans Juste Constant]], leader of the [[Haitian Communist Party]] (Parti Communiste d'Ha\u00efti\u2014PCH); and former Garde commander [[D\u00e9mosth\u00e8nes P\u00e9trus Calixte]], who stood as the candidate of a progressive coalition that included the Worker Peasant Movement (Mouvement Ouvrier Paysan\u2014MOP). MOP chose to endorse Calixte, instead of a candidate from its own ranks, because the party's leader, [[Daniel Fignol\u00e9]], was only thirty-three years old\u2014too young to stand for the nation's highest office. Estim\u00e9, politically the most moderate of the three, drew support from the black population in the north, as well as from the emerging black middle class. The leaders of the military, who would not countenance the election of Juste Constant and who reacted warily to the populist Fignol\u00e9, also considered Estim\u00e9 the safest candidate. After two rounds of polling, legislators gave Estim\u00e9 the presidency.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n===Estim\u00e9's presidency (1946\u201350)===\n[[File:Dumarsais estime portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Dumarsais Estim\u00e9]] ]]\nEstim\u00e9's election represented a break with Haiti's political tradition. Although he was reputed to have received support from commanders of the Garde, Estim\u00e9 was a civilian. Of humble origins, he was passionately anti-elitist and therefore generally antimulatto. He demonstrated, at least initially, a genuine concern for the welfare of the people. Operating under a new constitution that went into effect in November 1946, Estim\u00e9 proposed, but never secured passage of, Haiti's first social- security legislation. He did, however, expand the school system, encourage the establishment of rural cooperatives, raise the salaries of civil servants, and increase the representation of middle-class and lower-class blacks in the public sector. He also attempted to gain the favor of the Garde\u2014renamed the Haitian Army (Arm\u00e9e d'Ha\u00efti) in March 1947\u2014by promoting Lavaud to brigadier general and by seeking United States military assistance.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nEstim\u00e9 eventually fell victim to two of the time-honored pitfalls of Haitian rule: elite intrigue and personal ambition. The elite had a number of grievances against Estim\u00e9. Not only had he largely excluded them from the often lucrative levers of government, but he also enacted the country's first income tax, fostered the growth of labor unions, and suggested that vodou be considered as a religion equivalent to Roman Catholicism\u2014a notion that the Europeanized elite abhorred. Lacking direct influence in Haitian affairs, the elite resorted to clandestine lobbying among the officer corps. Their efforts, in combination with deteriorating domestic conditions, led to a coup in May 1950.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nTo be sure, Estim\u00e9 had hastened his own demise in several ways. His nationalization of the Standard Fruit banana concession sharply reduced the firm's revenues. He alienated workers by requiring them to invest between 10 percent and 15 percent of their salaries in national-defense bonds. The president sealed his fate by attempting to manipulate the constitution in order to extend his term in office. Seizing on this action and the popular unrest it engendered, the army forced the president to resign on 10 May 1950. The same junta that had assumed power after the fall of Lescot reinstalled itself. An army escort conducted Estim\u00e9 from the National Palace and into exile in Jamaica. The events of May 1946 made an impression upon the deposed minister of labor, Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier. The lesson that Duvalier drew from Estim\u00e9's ouster was that the military could not be trusted. It was a lesson that he would act upon when he gained power.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n===Magloire's presidency (1950\u201356)===\n[[File:Paul Magloire portrait.jpg |thumb|[[Paul Magloire]] ]]\n\nThe power balance within the junta shifted between 1946 and 1950. Lavaud was the preeminent member at the time of the first coup, but Magloire, now a colonel, dominated after Estim\u00e9's overthrow. When Haiti announced that its first direct elections (all men twenty-one or over were allowed to vote) would be held on 8 October 1950, Magloire resigned from the junta and declared himself a candidate for president. In contrast to the chaotic political climate of 1946, the campaign of 1950 proceeded under the implicit understanding that only a strong candidate backed by both the army and the elite would be able to take power. Facing only token opposition, Magloire won the election and assumed office on 6 December.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nMagloire restored the elite to prominence. The business community and the government benefited from favorable economic conditions until Hurricane Hazel hit the island in 1954. Haiti made some improvements on its infrastructure, but most of these were financed largely by foreign loans. By Haitian standards, Magloire's rule was firm, but not harsh: he jailed political opponents, including Fignol\u00e9, and shut down their presses when their protests grew too strident, but he allowed labor unions to function, although they were not permitted to strike. It was in the arena of corruption, however, that Magloire overstepped traditional bounds. The president controlled the sisal, cement, and soap monopolies. He and other officials built imposing mansions. The injection of international hurricane relief funds into an already corrupt system boosted graft to levels that disillusioned all Haitians. To make matters worse, Magloire followed in the footsteps of many previous presidents by disputing the termination date of his stay in office. Politicians, labor leaders, and their followers flocked to the streets in May 1956 to protest Magloire's failure to step down. Although Magloire declared martial law, a general strike essentially shut down Port-au-Prince. Again like many before him, Magloire fled to Jamaica, leaving the army with the task of restoring order.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n===The rise of Duvalier (1956\u201357)===\nThe period between the fall of Magloire and the election of Duvalier in September 1957 was a chaotic one, even by Haitian standards. Three provisional presidents held office during this interval; one resigned and the army deposed the other two, Franck Sylvain and Fignol\u00e9. Duvalier is said to have engaged actively in the behind-the-scenes intrigue that helped him to emerge as the presidential candidate that the military favored. The military went on to guide the campaign and the elections in a way that gave Duvalier every possible advantage. Most political actors perceived Duvalier\u2014a medical doctor who had served as a rural administrator of a United States-funded anti-yaws campaign before entering the cabinet under Estim\u00e9\u2014as an honest and fairly unassuming leader without a strong ideological motivation or program. When elections were finally organized, this time under terms of universal suffrage (both men and women now had the vote), Duvalier, a black, painted himself as the legitimate heir to Estim\u00e9. This approach was enhanced by the fact that Duvalier's only viable opponent, [[Louis D\u00e9joie]], was a mulatto and the scion of a prominent family. Duvalier scored a decisive victory at the polls. His followers took two-thirds of the legislature's lower house and all of the seats in the Senate.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n==The Duvalier era (1957\u201386)==\n{{main|Duvalier dynasty}}\n\n==='Papa Doc' (1957\u201371)===\n[[File:Duvalier (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier]] in 1968]]\nA former Minister of Health who had earned a reputation as a humanitarian while serving as an administrator in a U.S.-funded anti-[[yaws]] campaign, [[Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier]] (known as ''\"Papa Doc\"'') soon established another dictatorship. His regime is regarded as one of the most repressive and corrupt of modern times, combining violence against political opponents with exploitation of [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] to instill fear in the majority of the population. Duvalier's paramilitary police, officially the Volunteers for National Security (Volontaires de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Nationale \u2013 VSN) but more commonly known as the [[Tonton Macoute]]s, named for a Vodou monster, carried out political murders, beatings, and intimidation. An estimated 30,000 Haitians were killed by his government.<ref>{{citation |publisher=Country studies |place=US |url=http://countrystudies.us/haiti/17.htm |series=Haiti |title=Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier, 1957\u201371}}</ref> [[Sexual violence in Haiti|Duvalier employed rape]] as a political tool to silence political opposition.<ref>{{cite book |last=Girard |first=Philippe |title=Haiti: The Tumultuous History \u2013 From Pearl of the Caribbean to Broken Nation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L5KnihgGoIMC&pg=PA139 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |date=14 September 2010 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-230-11290-2 |ref=harv}}</ref> Incorporating many ''[[houngan]]s'' into the ranks of the Macoutes, his public recognition of Vodou and its practitioners and his private adherence to Vodou ritual, combined with his reputed private knowledge of magic and sorcery, enhanced his popular persona among the common people and served as a peculiar form of legitimization.\n\nDuvalier's policies, designed to end the dominance of the mulatto elite over the nation's economic and political life, led to massive emigration of educated people, deepening Haiti's economic and social problems. However, Duvalier appealed to the black middle class of which he was a member by introducing public works into middle-class neighborhoods that previously had been unable to have paved roads, running water, or modern sewage systems. In 1964, Duvalier proclaimed himself \"President for Life\".\n\nThe [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration suspended aid in 1961, after allegations that Duvalier had pocketed aid money and intended to use a [[Marine (military)|Marine Corps]] mission to strengthen the Macoutes. Duvalier also clashed with Dominican President [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] in 1963, after Bosch provided aid and asylum to Haitian exiles working to overthrow his regime. He ordered the Presidential Guard to occupy the Dominican chancery in [[P\u00e9tion-Ville]] to apprehend an officer involved in a plot to kidnap his children, leading Bosch to publicly threaten to invade Haiti. However, the Dominican army, which distrusted Bosch's leftist leanings, expressed little support for an invasion, and the dispute was settled by [[Organization of American States|OAS]] emissaries.\n\nIn 1971, Papa Doc entered into a 99-year contract with [[Don Pierson]] representing Dupont Caribbean Inc. of Texas for a [[free port]] project on the old [[buccaneer]] stronghold of [[Freeport Tortuga|Tortuga]] island located some {{convert|10|mi}} off the north coast of the main Haitian island of Hispaniola.\n\n==='Baby Doc' (1971\u201386)===\n[[File:Fleeing Duvaliers.jpg|thumb|Jean-Claude and Mich\u00e8le Duvalier en route to the airport to flee the country, 7 February 1986]]\n\nOn Duvalier's death in April 1971, power passed to his 19-year-old son [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]] (known as ''\"Baby Doc\"''). Under Jean-Claude Duvalier, Haiti's economic and political condition continued to decline, although some of the more fearsome elements of his father's regime were abolished. Foreign officials and observers also seemed more tolerant toward Baby Doc, in areas such as human-rights monitoring, and foreign countries were more generous to him with economic assistance. The United States restored its aid program in 1971. In 1974, Baby Doc expropriated the Freeport Tortuga project and this caused the venture to collapse. Content to leave administrative matters in the hands of his mother, Simone Ovid Duvalier, while living as a playboy, Jean-Claude enriched himself through a series of fraudulent schemes. Much of the Duvaliers' wealth, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars over the years, came from the R\u00e9gie du Tabac (Tobacco Administration), a tobacco monopoly established by Estim\u00e9, which expanded to include the proceeds from all government enterprises and served as a slush fund for which no balance sheets were ever kept.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://countrystudies.us/haiti/18.htm |publisher=Country studies |place=US |series=Haiti |title=Jean-Claude Duvalier, 1971\u201386}}</ref> His marriage, in 1980, to a beautiful mulatto divorc\u00e9e, [[Mich\u00e8le Bennett]], in a $3&nbsp;million ceremony, provoked widespread opposition, as it was seen as a betrayal of his father's antipathy towards the mulatto elite. At the request of Mich\u00e8le, Papa Doc's widow Simone was expelled from Haiti. Baby Doc's [[kleptocracy]] left the regime vulnerable to unanticipated crises, exacerbated by endemic poverty, most notably the epidemic of [[African swine fever virus]]\u2014which, at the insistence of [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] officials, led to the slaughter of the [[Creole Pig|creole pigs]], the principal source of income for most Haitians; and the widely publicized outbreak of AIDS in the early 1980s. Widespread discontent in Haiti began in 1983, when [[Pope John Paul II]] condemned the regime during a visit, finally provoking a rebellion, and in February 1986, after months of disorder, the army forced Duvalier to resign and go into exile.\n\n==The struggle for democracy (1986\u2013present day)==\n[[File:Fishing village in Haiti.jpg|thumb|Fishing village in Haiti, 1996]]\n[[File:Shopping streetin Haiti.jpg|thumb|Market street in Port-au-Prince, 1996]]\n\n===Transitional government (1986\u201390)===\nFrom 1986 to early 1988 Haiti was ruled by a provisional military government under General Namphy.

Various initiatives to end the political crisis through the peaceful restoration of the constitutionally elected government failed. In July 1994, as repression mounted in Haiti and a civilian human rights monitoring mission was expelled from the country, the United Nations Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 940]], which authorized member states to use all necessary means to facilitate the departure of Haiti's military leadership and to restore Haiti's constitutionally elected government to power.\n\n[[File:DD-SD-99-03743.jpg|thumb|President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returns triumphantly to the National Palace at Port-au-Prince, Haiti in 1994]]\n\n===The return of Aristide (1994\u201396)===\nIn mid-September 1994, with U.S. troops prepared to enter Haiti by force for [[Operation Uphold Democracy]], President [[Bill Clinton]] dispatched a negotiating team led by former President [[Jimmy Carter]] to persuade the authorities to step aside and allow for the return of constitutional rule. With intervening troops already airborne, C\u00e9dras and other top leaders agreed to step down. In October, Aristide was able to return. The [[Haitian general election, 1995]] in June 1995 saw Aristide's coalition, the Lavalas (Waterfall) Political Organization, gain a sweeping victory, and [[Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val]], a prominent Aristide political ally, elected President with 88% of the vote. When Aristide's term ended in February 1996, this was Haiti's first ever transition between two democratically elected presidents.\n\n===Preval's first Presidency (1996\u20132001)===\n[[File:U.S. Coast Guard intercepting Haitian refugees.GIF|thumb|U.S. Coast Guard intercepting Haitian refugees, 1998]]\n\n[[File:Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val on March 31, 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val]]]]\n\nIn late 1996, Aristide broke with Pr\u00e9val and formed a new political party, the Lavalas Family ([[Fanmi Lavalas]], FL), which won [[Haitian legislative election, 1997|elections in April 1997]] for one-third of the Senate and local assemblies, but these results were not accepted by the government. The split between Aristide and Pr\u00e9val produced a dangerous political deadlock, and the government was unable to organize the local and parliamentary elections due in late 1998. In January 1999, Pr\u00e9val dismissed legislators whose terms had expired \u2013 the entire Chamber of Deputies and all but nine members of the Senate, and Pr\u00e9val then ruled by decree.\n\n===Aristide's second presidency (2001\u201304)===\nIn May 2000 the [[Haitian legislative election, 2000]] for the Chamber of Deputies and two-thirds of the Senate took place. The election drew a voter turnout of more than 60%, and the FL won a virtual sweep. However, the elections were marred by controversy in the Senate race over the calculation of whether Senate candidates had achieved the majority required to avoid a run-off election (in Haiti, seats where no candidate wins an absolute majority of votes cast has to enter a second-round run-off election). The validity of the Electoral Council's post-ballot calculations of whether a majority had been attained was disputed. The [[Organization of American States]] complained about the calculation and declined to observe the July run-off elections. The opposition parties, regrouped in the Democratic Convergence ([[Convergence D\u00e9mocratique]], CD), demanded that the elections be annulled, and that Pr\u00e9val stand down and be replaced by a provisional government. In the meantime, the opposition announced it would boycott the [[Haitian presidential election, 2000|November presidential and senatorial elections]]. Haiti's main aid donors threatened to cut off aid. At the November 2000 elections, boycotted by the opposition, Aristide was again elected president, with more than 90% of the vote, on a turnout of around 50% according to international observers. The opposition refused to accept the result or to recognize Aristide as president.\n\nAllegations emerged of drug trafficking reaching into the upper echelons of government, as it had done under the military regimes of the 1980s and early 1990s ([[illegal drug trade in Haiti]]). Canadian police arrested Oriel Jean, Aristide's security chief and one of his most trusted friends, for money laundering.<ref>[http://www.sptimes.com/2004/04/03/Worldandnation/Taint_of_drugs_reachi.shtml Taint of drugs reaching Haiti's upper echelons]</ref> Beaudoin Ketant, a notorious international drug trafficker, Aristide's close partner, and his daughter's godfather, claimed that Aristide \"turned the country into a narco-country; it's a one-man show; you either pay (Aristide) or you die\".<ref>[[BBC]], 19 March 2004, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3524444.stm Haiti's drug money scourge]</ref>\n\nAristide spent years negotiating with the [[Convergence D\u00e9mocratique]] on new elections, but the Convergence's inability to develop a sufficient electoral base made elections unattractive, and it rejected every deal offered, preferring to call for a US invasion to topple Aristide.\n\n===The 2004 coup d'\u00e9tat===\n{{Main|2004 Haitian coup d'\u00e9tat}}\nAnti-Aristide protests in January 2004 led to violent clashes in Port-au-Prince, causing several deaths. In February, a revolt broke out in the city of [[Gona\u00efves]], which was soon under rebel control. The rebellion then began to spread, and Cap-Ha\u00eftien, Haiti's second-largest city, was captured. A mediation team of diplomats presented a plan to reduce Aristide's power while allowing him to remain in office until the end of his constitutional term. Although Aristide accepted the plan, it was rejected by the opposition, which mostly consisted of Haitian businessmen and former members of the army (who sought to reinstate the military following Aristide's disbandment of it).\n[[File:Port-au-Prince med.jpg|thumbnail|U.S. Marines patrol the streets of Port-au-Prince on 9 March 2004]]\nOn 29 February 2004, with rebel contingents marching towards Port-au-Prince, Aristide departed from Haiti. Aristide insists that he was essentially kidnapped by the U.S., while the U.S. [[United States Department of State|State Department]] maintains that he resigned from office. Aristide and his wife left Haiti on an American airplane, escorted by American diplomats and military personnel, and were flown directly to [[Bangui]], capital of the [[Central African Republic]], where he stayed for the following two weeks, before seeking [[right of asylum|asylum]] in a less remote location. This event was later characterized by Aristide as a kidnapping.\n\nThough this has never been proven, many observers in the press and academia believe that the US has not provided convincing answers to several of the more suspicious details surrounding the coup, such as the circumstances under which the US obtained Aristide's purported letter of \"resignation\" (as presented by the US) which, translated from [[Krey\u00f2l]], may not have actually read as a resignation.<ref name=\"Hallward2008\">{{cite web|url=http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/63/63-Resignation.pdf |title=Did he Jump or was he Pushed? |work=Press for Conversion! |year=2008 |pages=31\u201337 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630054053/http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/63/63-Resignation.pdf |archive-date=30 June 2013 |url-status=live |first=Peter |last=Hallward |author-link=Peter Hallward |publisher=Coalition to Oppose the Arms Trade |location=Ottawa |issue=63 |issn=1183-8892 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAristide has accused the U.S. of deposing him in concert with the Haitian opposition.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/americas/03/01/aristide.claim/ |title=Aristide says U.S. deposed him in 'coup d'\u00e9tat' |publisher=CNN |date=2 March 2004 |accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> In a 2006 interview, he said the U.S. went back on their word regarding compromises he made with them over privatization of enterprises to ensure that part of the profits would go to the Haitian people and then \"relied on a disinformation campaign\" to discredit him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=55&ItemID=12166 |date=19 February 2007 |quote=Aristide's interview was conducted in French, in Pretoria, on 20 July 2006; originally published in London Review of Books |title=An Interview with Jean-Bertrand Aristide |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070222050105/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=55&ItemID=12166 |archivedate=2007-02-22 |accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nPolitical organizations and writers, as well as Aristide himself, have suggested that the rebellion was in fact a foreign controlled coup d'\u00e9tat.

On one hand, he and his associates were accused of being involved in money laundering and various other crimes resulting in countless demonstrations (which on many occasions would become violent). Many criticized him for the slow progression of the reconstruction phase following the recent quake, or for taking credit for projects started in previous administrations. Some disliked him for his vulgar language and risque past which didn't seem to completely go away upon taking presidency. On the other hand, many believe that he was the most productive Haitian president since the Duvalier era. Under his administration, the majority of those left homeless following the quake were given new housing. He offered free education programs to large portions of the Haitian youth as well as an income program for Haitian mothers and students. The administration launched a massive reconstruction program involving principle administration district, Champs-de-Mars, that would modernize and rehabilitate various government buildings, public places, and parks. Michel Martelly put emphasis on foreign investment and business with his slogan \"Haiti is Open for Business\". Perhaps one of the more major contributions made for the revitalization of the Haitian economy was their push for tourists. Minister of Tourism, [[St\u00e9phanie Villedrouin]], embarked on various competitive tourist projects, including the development of Ile-a-Vache, Jacmel, the north, south-west, and Cotes-des-Arcadins.

It was inhabited by the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] and [[Arawak peoples|Arawakan]] people, who variously called their island ''Ayiti'', ''Bohio'', and ''Kiskeya'' ''(Quisqueya)''. Columbus promptly claimed the island for the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]], naming it ''La Isla Espa\u00f1ola'' (\"the Spanish Island\"), later [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] to ''[[Hispaniola]]''. French influence began in 1625, and French control of what was called [[Saint-Domingue]] in modern-day Haiti began in 1660. From 1697 on, the western part of the island was French, and the eastern part was Spanish. Haiti became one of the wealthiest of France's colonies, producing vast quantities of sugar and coffee and depending on a brutal slave system for the necessary labor. Inspired by the message of the [[French Revolution]], Haitian slaves rose up in [[Haitian Revolution#The Revolution|revolt]] in 1791, and after decades of struggle, the independent republic of Haiti was officially proclaimed in 1804.\n\n==Pre-Spanish history==\n{{Main|Chiefdoms of Hispaniola}}\nSuccessive waves of [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] migrants, moving northward from the [[Orinoco]] delta in South America, settled the islands of the [[Caribbean]]. Around A.D. 600, the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]], an Arawak culture, arrived on the island, displacing the previous inhabitants. They were organized into ''[[cacicazgo]]s'' (chiefdoms), each led by a ''cacique'' (chief).\n\n==Spanish history (1492\u20131625)==\n[[Christopher Columbus]] established the settlement, [[La Navidad]], near the modern town of [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]]. It was built from the timbers of his wrecked ship, [[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|Santa Mar\u00eda]], during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|first voyage]] in December 1492. When he returned in 1493 on his second voyage he found the settlement had been destroyed and all 39 settlers killed. Columbus continued east and founded a new settlement at [[La Isabela]] on the territory of the present-day [[Dominican Republic]] in 1493. The capital of the colony was moved to [[Santo Domingo]] in 1496, on the south west coast of the island also in the territory of the present-day Dominican Republic. The Spanish returned to western Hispaniola in 1502, establishing a settlement at Yaguana near modern-day [[L\u00e9og\u00e2ne]]. A second settlement was established on the north coast in 1504 called Puerto Real near modern [[Fort-Libert\u00e9]] \u2013 which in 1578 was relocated to a nearby site and renamed Bayaja.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haitiantreasures.com/HT_fort-liberte.htm |title=Fort-Libert\u00e9: A captivating Site |accessdate=2010-07-01 |publisher=Haitian Treasures |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527062805/http://www.haitiantreasures.com/HT_fort-liberte.htm |archivedate=27 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Clammer |first=Paul |author2=Michael Grosberg |author3=Jens Porup |title=Dominican Republic and Haiti |pages=339, 330\u2013333 |accessdate=2010-07-01 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kjde3Fmwb7IC&pg=PA340 |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-74104-292-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://population.mongabay.com/population/haiti/3725170/fort-liberte |title=Population of Fort Libert\u00e9, Haiti |accessdate=2010-07-01 |publisher=Mongabay.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717220658/http://population.mongabay.com/population/haiti/3725170/fort-liberte |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the arrival of Europeans, La Hispaniola's indigenous population suffered greatly to near extinction, in possibly the worst case of depopulation in the Americas. A commonly accepted hypothesis attributes the high mortality of this colony in part to European diseases to which the natives had no immunity. A small number of [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00ednos]] were able to survive and set up villages elsewhere. Spanish interest in [[Hispaniola]] began to wane in the 1520s, as more lucrative [[gold]] and [[silver]] deposits were found in Mexico and South America. Thereafter, the population of Spanish Hispaniola grew at a slow pace.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nThe settlement of Yaguana was burnt to the ground three times in its just over a century long existence as a Spanish settlement, first by French pirates in 1543, again on May 27, 1592, by a 110-strong landing party from a four-ship English naval squadron led by [[Christopher Newport]] in his flagship Golden Dragon, who destroyed all 150 houses in the settlement, and finally by the Spanish themselves in 1605, for reasons set out below.<ref>''Historic Cities of the Americas: An Illustrated Encyclopedia'' (2005).

The Dutch responded by sourcing new salt supplies from Spanish America where colonists were more than happy to trade. So large numbers of Dutch traders/pirates joined their English and French brethren trading on the remote coasts of Hispaniola. In 1605, Spain was infuriated that Spanish settlements on the northern and western coasts of the island persisted in carrying out large scale and illegal trade with the Dutch, who were at that time fighting a war of independence against Spain in Europe and the English, a very recent enemy state, and so decided to forcibly resettle their inhabitants closer to the city of [[Santo Domingo]].<ref>Knight, Franklin, ''The Caribbean: The Genesis of a Fragmented Nationalism'', 3rd ed. p. 54 New York, Oxford University Press 1990.</ref> This action, known as the ''Devastaciones de Osorio'', proved disastrous; more than half of the resettled colonists died of starvation or disease, over 100,000 cattle were abandoned, and many slaves escaped.<ref>''Rough Guide to the Dominican Republic'', p. 352.</ref> Five of the existing thirteen settlements on the island were brutally razed by Spanish troops including the two settlements on the territory of present-day Haiti, La Yaguana, and Bayaja.

In 1697, after decades of fighting over the territory, the Spanish ceded the western\npart of the island to the French, who henceforth called it Saint-Domingue. Saint-Domingue developed into a highly lucrative colony for France. Its economy was based on a labor-intensive sugar industry which rested on vast numbers of African slaves. Meanwhile, the situation on the Spanish part of the island deteriorated. The entire Spanish empire sank into a deep economic crisis, and Santo Domingo was in addition struck by earthquakes, hurricanes and a shrinking population.\n\n==French Saint-Domingue (1625\u20131789)==\n{{Main|Saint-Domingue}}\n\n===The Pearl of the Antilles (1711\u201389)===\n[[File:D072- une sucrerie \u00e0 saint-domingue - Liv3-Ch16.png|thumb|upright=1.5|A [[sugar mill]] in Haiti (''L\u2019Homme et la Terre'' by [[\u00c9lis\u00e9e Reclus]], 1830\u20131905)]]\n[[File:Cap_Fran\u00e7ais_-_Gravure_ancienne_-_1728.jpg|thumb|Engraving of [[Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]] in 1728]]\n\nIn 1711, the city of [[Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]] was formally established by [[Louis XIV]] and took over as capital of the colony from [[Port-de-Paix]]. In 1726, the city of [[Les Cayes]] was founded on the Southern coast which became the biggest settlement in the south. In 1749, the city of [[Port-au-Prince]] was established on the West coast, which in 1770 took over as the capital of the colony from Cap-Fran\u00e7ais, however that same year the [[1770 Port-au-Prince earthquake]] and tsunami destroyed the city killing 200 people immediately, and 30,000 later from famine and disease brought on by the natural disaster. This was the second major earthquake to hit Saint-Domingue as it followed the [[1751 Port-au-Prince earthquake]] which had left only a single stone built building standing in the town.\n\nPrior to the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u201363), the economy of Saint-Domingue gradually expanded, with sugar and, later, coffee becoming important export crops. After the war, which disrupted maritime commerce, the colony underwent rapid expansion. In 1767, it exported 72&nbsp;million pounds of [[raw sugar]] and 51&nbsp;million pounds of refined sugar, one million pounds of indigo, and two million pounds of cotton.<ref>{{cite book |first=CLR |last=James |title=The Black Jacobins |url=https://archive.org/details/blackjacobinstou00jame |url-access=registration |publisher=Vintage Books |place=New York |year=1963 |page=[https://archive.org/details/blackjacobinstou00jame/page/45 45]}}</ref> Saint-Domingue became known as the \"Pearl of the [[Antilles]]\" \u2013 the richest colony in the 18th century [[French colonial empire|French empire]]. By the 1780s, Saint-Domingue produced about 40 percent of all the sugar and 60 percent of all the coffee consumed in Europe. This single colony, roughly the size of [[Hawaii]] or [[Belgium]], produced more sugar and coffee than all of [[British West Indies|Britain's West Indian colonies]] combined.\n\nIn the second half of the 1780s, Saint-Domingue accounted for a third of the entire [[Atlantic slave trade]].  The population of the African slaves imported for these plantations is estimated to have been 790,000.  Between 1764 and 1771, the average importation of slaves varied between 10,000\u201315,000, by 1786 about 28,000, and, from 1787 onward, the colony received more than 40,000 slaves a year. However, the inability to maintain slave numbers without constant resupply from Africa meant the slave population, by 1789, totaled 500,000,{{non sequitur|date=February 2020}} ruled over by a white population that, by 1789, numbered only 32,000.<ref>{{cite book |first=CLR |last=James |title=The Black Jacobins |page=55}}</ref> At all times, a majority of slaves in the colony were African-born, as the brutal conditions of slavery prevented the population from experiencing growth through natural increase [https://web.archive.org/web/20060617033237/http://www.africanaonline.com/slavery_colonial_era.htm]. African culture thus remained strong among slaves to the end of French rule, in particular the folk-religion of [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]], which commingled Catholic liturgy and ritual with the beliefs and practices of [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]], [[Kingdom of Kongo|Congo]], and [[Dahomey]].<ref>Vodou is a Dahomean word meaning 'god' or 'spirit</ref> Slave traders scoured the Atlantic coast of Africa, and the slaves who arrived came from hundreds of different tribes, their languages often mutually incomprehensible.\n\n[[File:Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re Aerial View.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Citadelle Laferri\u00e8re]], built by [[Henri Christophe]], is the largest [[fortress]] in the Americas.]]\nTo regularize slavery, in 1685 [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] enacted the ''[[Code Noir]]'', which accorded certain human rights to slaves and responsibilities to the master, who was obliged to feed, clothe, and provide for the general well-being of their slaves. The ''code noir'' also sanctioned corporal punishment, allowing masters to employ brutal methods to instill in their slaves the necessary docility, while ignoring provisions intended to regulate the administration of punishments. A passage from [[Henri Christophe]]'s personal secretary, who lived more than half his life as a slave, describes the crimes perpetrated against the slaves of Saint-Domingue by their French masters:\n\n{{quote|\nHave they not hung up men with heads downward, drowned them in sacks, crucified them on planks, buried them alive, crushed them in mortars?

Have they not thrown them into boiling cauldrons of cane syrup? Have they not put men and women inside barrels studded with spikes and rolled them down mountainsides into the abyss?

The most famous was [[Fran\u00e7ois Mackandal|Mackandal]], a one-armed slave, originally from [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]], who escaped in 1751. A [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] Houngan (priest), he united many of the different maroon bands. He spent the next six years staging successful raids and evading capture by the French, reputedly killing over 6,000 people, while preaching a fanatic vision of the destruction of white civilization in St. Domingue. In 1758, after a failed plot to poison the drinking water of the plantation owners, he was captured and burned alive at the public square in Cap-Fran\u00e7ais.\n\nSaint-Domingue also had the largest and wealthiest [[free people of color|free population of color]] in the [[History of the Caribbean|Caribbean]], the ''[[gens de couleur]]'' (French, \"people of color\"). The mixed-race community in Saint-Domingue numbered 25,000 in 1789. First-generation gens de couleur were typically the offspring of a male, French slaveowner and an African slave chosen as a concubine. In the French colonies, the semi-official institution of \"[[pla\u00e7age]]\" defined this practice. By this system, the children were free people and could inherit property, thus originating a class of \"mulattos\" with property and some with wealthy fathers. This class occupied a middle status between African slaves and French colonists. Africans who attained freedom also enjoyed status as gens de couleur.\n\nAs numbers of ''gens de couleur'' grew, the French rulers enacted discriminatory laws. Statutes forbade ''gens de couleur'' from taking up certain professions, marrying whites, wearing European clothing, carrying swords or firearms in public, or attending social functions where whites were present. However, these regulations did not restrict their purchase of land, and many accumulated substantial holdings and became slave-owners. By 1789, they owned one-third of the plantation property and one-quarter of the slaves of [[Saint-Domingue]].<ref>{{cite book |publisher=GMU |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap8a.html |title=Revolution |chapter=8 |page=1 |access-date=14 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105214459/http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap8a.html |archive-date=5 November 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Central to the rise of the ''gens de couleur'' planter class was the growing importance of coffee, which thrived on the marginal hillside plots to which they were often relegated. The largest concentration of ''gens de couleur'' was in the southern peninsula, the last region of the colony to be settled, owing to its distance from Atlantic shipping lanes and its formidable terrain, with the highest mountain range in the Caribbean.\n\n==Revolutionary period (1789\u20131804)==\n[[File:Toussaint L'Ouverture.jpg|thumb|As unofficial leader of the revolution, [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] is considered the father of Haiti.]]\n{{Main|Haitian Revolution}}\n\n===Og\u00e9's revolt (1789\u201391)===\nThe outbreak of [[French Revolution|revolution in France]] in the summer of 1789 had a powerful effect on the colony. While the French settlers debated how new revolutionary laws would apply to Saint-Domingue, outright civil war broke out in 1790 when the free men of color claimed they too were French citizens under the terms of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]. Ten days before the fall of the [[Bastille]], in July 1789, the French [[National Assembly]] had voted to seat six delegates from Saint-Domingue. In Paris, a group of wealthy mulattoes, led by [[Julien Raimond]] and [[Vincent Og\u00e9]], unsuccessfully petitioned the white planter delegates to support mulatto claims for full civil and political rights. Through the efforts of a group called [[Society of the Friends of the Blacks|''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Amis des Noirs'']], of which Raimond and Og\u00e9 were prominent leaders, in March 1790 the [[National Assembly]] granted full civic rights to the ''gens de couleur.''\nVincent Og\u00e9 traveled to St. Domingue to secure the promulgation and implementation of this decree, landing near Cap-Fran\u00e7ais (now [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]]) in October 1790 and petitioning the royal governor, the Comte de Peynier. After his demands were refused, he attempted to incite the ''gens de couleur'' to revolt. Og\u00e9 and [[Jean-Baptiste Chavannes|Jean-Baptiste Chavennes]], a veteran of the [[Siege of Savannah]] during the [[American Revolution]], attempted to attack Cap-Fran\u00e7ais. However, the mulatto rebels refused to arm or free their slaves, or to challenge the status of slavery, and their attack was defeated by a force of white militia and black volunteers (including [[Henri Christophe]]). Afterwards, they fled across the frontier to [[Hinche]], at the time in the Spanish part of the island. However, they were captured, returned to the French authorities, and both Og\u00e9 and Chavennes were executed in February 1791.\n\n===The rising of the slaves (1791\u201393)===\n[[File:Incendie_de_la_Plaine_du_Cap._-_Massacre_des_Blancs_par_les_Noirs._FRANCE_MILITAIRE._-_Martinet_del._-_Masson_Sculp_-_33.jpg|thumb|\"Burning of the Plaine du Cap \u2013 Massacre of whites by the blacks\". On August 22, 1791, slaves set fire to plantations, torched cities and massacred the white population.]]\nOn 14 August 1791, slaves in the northern region of the colony staged a revolt that began the [[Haitian Revolution]]. Tradition marks the beginning of the revolution at a [[Haitian Vodou|vodou]] ceremony at [[Bois Ca\u00efman]] (Alligator Woods) near Cap-Fran\u00e7ais. The call to arms was issued by a [[Houngan]] (Vodou priest) named [[Dutty Boukman]]. Within hours, the northern plantations were in flames. The rebellion spread through the entire colony. Boukman was captured and executed, but the rebellion continued to spread rapidly.\n\nIn 1792, [[L\u00e9ger-F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Sonthonax]] was sent to the colony by the French Legislative Assembly as part of the Revolutionary Commission. His main goal was to maintain French control of Saint-Domingue, stabilize the colony, and enforce the social equality recently granted to free people of color by the National Convention of France.\n\n===Toussaint Louverture ascendant (1793\u20131802)===\n[[File:Vue_de_l%27incendie_de_la_ville_du_cap_fran\u00e7ais_f1.highres.jpg|thumb|Fire of [[Cap Fran\u00e7ais]], 21 June 1793]]\n[[Image:Andr\u00e9 Rigaud.gif|thumb|Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]]\n{{main|:s:Constitution of Saint-Domingue}}\n\nOn 29 August 1793, Sonthonax took the radical step of proclaiming the freedom of the slaves in the north province (with severe limits on their freedom). In September and October, emancipation was extended throughout the colony. The French National Convention, the first elected Assembly of the [[French First Republic|First Republic]] (1792\u20131804), on 4 February 1794, under the leadership of [[Maximilien de Robespierre]], abolished slavery by law in France and all its colonies. The constitution of 1793, which was never applied, and the constitution of 1795, which was put into effect, did both contain an explicit ban on slavery.\n\nThe slaves did not immediately flock to Sonthonax's banner, however. White colonists continued to fight Sonthonax, with assistance from the British. They were joined by many of the free men of color who opposed the abolition of slavery. It was not until word of France's ratification of emancipation arrived back in the colony that [[Toussaint Louverture]] and his corps of well disciplined, battle-hardened former slaves came over to the French Republican side in early May 1794. A change in the political winds in France caused Sonthonax to be recalled in 1796, but not before taking the step of arming the former slaves.\n\nWhen the radical revolutionaries in Paris declared war against Spain in January 1793, the Spanish Crown sent its forces in [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] into battle on the side of the slaves. By the end of 1793, Spain controlled most of the north, except British-held M\u00f4le-Saint-Nicolas and French-held Le Cap Fran\u00e7ois and Port-de-Paix.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Haitian Revolution, 1789-1804|date=1973|publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press|page=79}}</ref> In 1795, Spain ceded Santo Domingo to France and Spanish attacks on Saint-Domingue ceased.\n\nIn the south the British suffered a series of defeats at the hands of the mulatto General [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]]. On October 6, 1794, Rigaud took L\u00e9ogane. On December 26, 1794, he attacked the British-held Tiburon, routing and decimating the British garrison along with black troops under the command of Jean Kina fighting with them.<ref>{{cite book|title=Avengers of the New World: The Story of the Haitian Revolution|date=2009|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|page=182}}</ref> In 1798, having lost territory and thousands of men, the British were forced to withdraw.\n\nIn the meantime, Rigaud had set up a mulatto separatist movement in the south and [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion|P\u00e9tion]] had joined him. With the British out, Toussaint swung into action against them. As he sent General [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]] against Grand and Petit Go\u00e2ve and General [[Henri Christophe|Christophe]] against the mulatto stronghold of Jacmel, heavily armed American ships bombarded mulatto fortifications and destroyed Rigaud's transport barges.<ref>{{cite book|title=The American Counterrevolution: A Retreat from Liberty, 1783-1800|date=1998|publisher=Stackpole Books|page=485}}</ref> The display of American force and the fierce fighting of Toussaint's troops brought victory.\n\nBy 1801, Toussaint was in control of all of Hispaniola, after conquering [[Era de Francia|French Santo Domingo]] and proclaiming the abolition of slavery there. He did not, however, proclaim full independence for the country, nor did he seek reprisals against the country's former white slaveholders, convinced that the French would not restore slavery and \"that a population of slaves recently landed from Africa could not attain to civilization by 'going it alone.'\"<ref>{{cite book |first=CLR |last=James |title=The Black Jacobins |publisher=Vintage Books |place=New York |year=1990 |page=290}}</ref>\n\n===Napoleon defeated (1802\u201304)===\n[[File:Prise du Cap Fran\u00e7ais par G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Le Clerc 15 et 20 Pluviose, An 10 (Nuevo).jpg|thumb|The French army led by Le Clerc lands in [[Cap Fran\u00e7ais]] (1802)]]\n[[File:Haitian revolution.jpg|thumb|Leclerc's veterans [[Battle of Ravine-\u00e0-Couleuvres|storm Ravine-a-Couleuvre]] (Snake Gully) in 1802.]]\n[[File:Battle for Palm Tree Hill.jpg|thumb|''Battle for Santo Domingo'', by [[January Suchodolski]] (1845)]]\n<!--[[File:Haitian_Revolution.jpg|thumb|Attack and take of the [[Cr\u00eate-\u00e0-Pierrot]].

For a time, Leclerc met with some success; he also brought the eastern part of the island of Hispaniola under the direct control of France in accordance with the terms of the 1795 [[Peace of Basel|Treaties of B\u00e2le]] with Spain. With a large expedition that eventually included 40,000 European troops, and receiving help from white colonists and mulatto forces commanded by [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion]], a former lieutenant of Rigaud, the French won several victories after severe fighting. Two of Toussaint's chief lieutenants, Dessalines and Christophe, recognizing their untenable situation, held separate parleys with the invaders, and agreed to transfer their allegiance. At this point, Leclerc invited Toussaint to negotiate a settlement. It was a deception; Toussaint was seized and deported to France, where he died of [[pneumonia]] while imprisoned at [[Fort de Joux]] in the [[Jura Mountains]] in April 1803.\n\nOn 20 May 1802, Napoleon signed a law to maintain slavery where it had not yet disappeared, namely [[Martinique]], [[Tobago]], and [[Saint Lucia]]. A confidential copy of this decree was sent to Leclerc, who was authorized to restore slavery in Saint-Domingue when the time was opportune. At the same time, further edicts stripped the ''gens de couleur'' of their newly won civil rights. None of these decrees were published or executed in St. Domingue, but, by midsummer, word began to reach the colony of the French intention to restore slavery. The betrayal of Toussaint and news of French actions in Martinique undermined the collaboration of leaders such as [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]], [[Henri Christophe|Christophe]], and [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion|P\u00e9tion]]. Convinced that the same fate lay in store for Saint-Domingue, these commanders and others once again battled Leclerc. With the French intent on reconquest and re-enslavement of the colony's black population, the war became a bloody struggle of atrocity and attrition. The rainy season brought [[yellow fever]] and [[malaria]], which took a heavy toll on the invaders. By November, when Leclerc died of yellow fever, 24,000 French soldiers were dead and 8,000 were hospitalized, the majority from disease.<ref>{{cite book |first=CLR |last=James |title=Black Jacobins |page=355}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Leclerc was replaced by [[Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau]]. Rochambeau wrote to Napoleon that, to reclaim Saint-Domingue, France must 'declare the negroes slaves, and destroy at least 30,000 negroes and negresses.'<ref>{{cite book |first=CLR |last=James |title=Black Jacobins |page=360}}</ref> In his desperation, he turned to increasingly wanton acts of brutality; the French burned alive, hanged, drowned, and tortured black prisoners, reviving such practices as burying blacks in piles of insects and boiling them in cauldrons of molasses. One night, at Port-R\u00e9publican, he held a ball to which he invited the most prominent mulatto ladies and, at midnight, announced the death of their husbands. However, each act of brutality was repaid by the Haitian rebels. After one battle, Rochambeau buried 500 prisoners alive; Dessalines responded by hanging 500 French prisoners.<ref>{{harvnb|Heinl|1996|pp=108\u20139}}</ref> Rochambeau's brutal tactics helped unite black, mulatto, and mestizo soldiers against the French.\n\nAs the tide of the war turned toward the former slaves, Napoleon abandoned his dreams of restoring France's New World empire. In 1803, war resumed between France and Britain, and with the [[Royal Navy]] firmly in control of the seas, reinforcements and supplies for Rochambeau never arrived in sufficient numbers. To concentrate on the war in Europe, Napoleon signed the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in April, selling France's North American possessions to the United States. The Haitian army, now led by Dessalines, devastated Rochembeau and the French army at the [[Battle of Verti\u00e8res]] on 18 November 1803.\n\nOn 1 January 1804 Dessalines then declared independence,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/dol/images/examples/haiti/0001.pdf |publisher=National archives |place=UK |title=D\u00e9claration d'ind\u00e9pendance}}</ref> reclaiming the indigenous Ta\u00edno name of Haiti (\"Land of Mountains\") for the new nation. Most of the remaining French colonists fled ahead of the defeated French army, many migrating to [[Louisiana]] or [[Cuba]]. Unlike Toussaint, Dessalines showed little equanimity with regard to the whites. In a final act of retribution, [[1804 Haiti massacre|the remaining French were slaughtered by Haitian military forces]]. Some 2,000 Frenchmen were massacred at Cap-Fran\u00e7ais, 900 in Port-au-Prince, and 400 at J\u00e9r\u00e9mie.

At the time, there was a familiar situation going on back in their homeland, as these Polish soldiers were fighting for their liberty from the invading Russia, Prussia and Austria that began in 1772. As hopeful as the Haitians, many Poles were seeking union amongst themselves to win back their homeland. As a result, many Polish soldiers admired their enemy and decided to turn on the French army and join the [[Haiti]]an slaves, and participated in the Haitian revolution of 1804, supporting the principles of liberty for all the people. [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Franciszek Jab\u0142onowski]] who was half-Black was one of the Polish generals at the time. Polish soldiers had a remarkable input in helping the Haitians in the retaliation fights against the French oppressor. They were spared the fate of other Europeans. For their loyalty and support for overthrowing the French, some Poles acquired Haitian citizenship after Haiti gained its Independence, and many of them settled there to never return to [[Poland]]. It is estimated that around 500 of the 5280 Poles chose this option. Of the remainder, 700 returned to France to eventually return to Poland, and some \u2013 after capitulation \u2013 were forced to serve in British units.<ref name=\"North\" /> 160 Poles were later given permission to leave Haiti and some particular ones were sent to France at Haitian expense.

Furthermore, owing to entrenched opposition from Southern slave states, Haiti did not receive U.S. diplomatic recognition until 1862 (after those states had seceded from the Union) \u2013 largely through the efforts of anti-slavery senator [[Charles Sumner]] of Massachusetts.\n\nUpon assuming power, General Dessalines authorized the Constitution of 1804. This constitution, in terms of social freedoms, called for:\n# Freedom of religion (Under Toussaint, Catholicism had been declared the official state religion);\n# All citizens of Haiti, regardless of skin color, to be known as \"Black\" (this was an attempt to eliminate the multi-tiered racial hierarchy that had developed in Haiti, with full or near full-blooded Europeans at the top, various levels of light to brown skin in the middle, and dark skinned \"Kongo\" from Africa at the bottom).\n# White men were forbidden from possessing property or domain on Haitian soil.

Yet two of his own advisers, [[Henri Christophe]] and [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion]], helped provoke his assassination in 1806. The conspirators ambushed him north of [[Port-au-Prince]] at Pont Larnage (now known as Pont-Rouge) on 17 October 1806 en route to battle rebels to his regime.\n\nThe state created under Dessalines was the opposite of what the Haitian mass or the peasantry preferred. While both the elite leaders, such as Dessalines, as well as the Haitian population agreed the state should be built on the ideals of freedom and democracy,<ref>Jean-Jaques Dessalines, Haitian Declaration of Independence, 1804.

The leaders of Haiti tied independence from other powers as their notion of freedom.\n\nHowever, the Haitian peasantry tied their notion of freedom to the land. Because of the mountainous terrain, Haitian slaves were able to cultivate their own small tracts of land. Thus, freedom for them was the ability to cultivate their own land within a subsistence economy. Unfortunately, because of the leaders\u2019 desires, a system of coerced plantation agriculture emerged.<ref>James Franklin, the Present State of Hayti with remarks on its agriculture, commerce, laws, religion, finances and population (Connecticut: Negro Universities Press, 1828), 189-190.</ref> Furthermore, while all Haitians desired a black republic,<ref name=\"faculty.webster.edu\"/> the cultural practices of African-Americans were a point of contention. Many within the Haitian population wanted to maintain their African heritage, which is a logical connection to wanting a black republic. However, the elites typically tried to prove the sophistication of Haitians through literature. Some authors wrote that the barbarism of Africa must be expelled, while maintaining African roots.<ref>Beaubrun Ardouin, Etudes sur l\u2019historie d\u2019Haiti : suivies de la vie du g\u00e9n\u00e9ral J.M.

Quoted in Erin Zavitz, \"Revolutionary narrations: Early Haitian historiography and the challenge of writing counter-history,\" Atlantic Studies, 14, no. 3 (2017), 343.</ref> Furthermore, to maintain freedom and independence, the elites failed to provide a civil society that the Haitian mass desired. The Haitian peasants desired not only land freedom but also civil rights, such as voting and political participation as well as access to education.<ref name=\"Mimi Sheller 2000\"/> The state failed to provide those basic rights.\n\nThe state was essentially run by the military, which meant that it was very difficult for the Haitian population to participate in democratic processes. Most importantly, the state failed to provide proper access to education that a state consisting of former slaves would need.<ref>M.B. Bird, the Black Man or Haytian Independence (New York: Published by Author, 1869), 220.</ref> It was nearly impossible for the former slaves to participate effectively because they lacked the basic literacy that was intentionally denied to them by French colonial rule. Through differing views on Haitian nationalism and freedom, the elites created a state that greatly favored them, over the Haitian population and the Haitian peasantry.\n\n===The struggle for unity (1806\u201320)===\n[[File:Duckworth's Action off San Domingo, 6 February 1806.jpg|thumb|The [[battle of Santo Domingo]] (1806) painted by \t\nNicholas Pocock in 1808]]\n\nAfter the Dessalines coup d'\u00e9tat, the two main conspirators divided the country in two rival regimes. Christophe created the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[State of Haiti]] in the north, and the [[Gens de couleur]] P\u00e9tion helped establish the [[Haiti|Republic of Haiti]] in the south. Christophe attempted to maintain a strict system of labor and agricultural production akin to the former plantations. Although, strictly speaking, he did not establish slavery, he imposed a semi-feudal system, fumage, in which every able man was required to work in plantations (similar to [[Latifundia|latifundios]]) to produce goods for the fledgling country. His method, though undoubtedly oppressive, produced the most revenues of the two governments.\n\nBy contrast, P\u00e9tion broke up the former colonial estates and parceled out the land into small holdings. In P\u00e9tion's south, the [[gens de couleur]] minority led the government and feared losing popular support, and thus, sought to assuage class tensions with land redistribution. Because of the weak international position and its labor policies (most peasants lived through a subsistence economy), P\u00e9tion's government was perpetually on the brink of bankruptcy. Yet, for most of its time, it produced one of the most liberal and tolerant Haitian governments ever. In 1815, at a key period of [[Military career of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar's fight for Venezuelan independence]], he gave the Venezuelan leader [[right of asylum|asylum]] and provided him soldiers and substantial material support. It also had the least of internal military skirmishes, despite its continuous conflicts with Christophe's northern kingdom. In 1816, however, after finding the burden of the [[Senate]] intolerable, he suspended the legislature and turned his post into [[President for Life]]. Not long after, he died of [[yellow fever]], and his assistant [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]] replaced him.\n\n[[File:Kingdom of Haiti.jpg|thumbnail|The Kingdom of Haiti in the North and the Republic of Haiti in the South]]\nIn this period, the eastern part of the island rose against the new powers following general Juan S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez's claims of independence from France, which broke the Treaties of B\u00e2le attacking Spain and prohibited commerce with Haiti. In the Palo Hincado battle (7 November 1808), all the remaining French forces were defeated by Spanish-creole insurrectionists. On 9 July 1809, Santo Domingo was born. The government put itself under the control of Spain, earning it the nickname of \"Espa\u00f1a Boba\" (meaning \"The Idiot Spain\").\n\nIn 1811, Christophe proclaimed himself King Henri I in the North and commissioned several extraordinary buildings. He even created a nobility class in the fashion of European monarchies. Yet in 1820, weakened by illness and with a decreasing support for his authoritarian regime, he killed himself with a silver bullet rather than face a coup d'\u00e9tat. Immediately after, P\u00e9tion's successor, Boyer, reunited Haiti through diplomatic tactics, and ruled as president until his overthrow in 1843.\n\n===Boyer's domination of Hispaniola (1820\u201343)===\n{{main|Unification of Hispaniola}}\n[[File:President_Jean-Pierre_Boyer_of_Haiti_(Hispaniola_Unification_Regime)_Portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Pierre Boyer]]]]\n\nAlmost two years after Boyer had consolidated power in the west, in 1821, Santo Domingo declared independence from Spain and requested from Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar inclusion in the [[Gran Colombia]]. Boyer, however, responding to a party on the east that preferred Haiti over Colombia, occupied the ex-Spanish colony in January 1822, encountering no military resistance. In this way he accomplished the unity of the island, which was only carried out for a short period of time by [[Toussaint Louverture]] in 1801. Boyer's occupation of the Spanish side also responded to internal struggles among Christophe's generals, to which Boyer gave extensive powers and lands in the east. This occupation, however, pitted the Spanish white elite against the iron fisted Haitian administration, and stimulated the emigration of many white wealthy families. The entire island remained under Haitian rule until 1844, when in the east a nationalist group called [[La Trinitaria (Dominican Republic)|La Trinitaria]] led a revolt that partitioned the island into [[Haiti]] on the west and [[Dominican Republic]] on the east, based on what would appear to be a riverine territorial 'divide' from the pre-contact period.\n\nFrom 1824 to 1826, while the island was under one government, Boyer promoted the largest single [[Haitian emigration|free-Black immigration]] from the [[Thomas Jefferson and Haitian Emigration|United States]] in which more than 6,000 immigrants settled in different parts of the island. Today remnants of these immigrants live throughout the island, but the larger number reside in [[Saman\u00e1 Peninsula|Saman\u00e1]], a peninsula on the Dominican side of the island. From the government's perspective, the intention of the immigration was to help establish commercial and diplomatic relationships with the US, and to increase the number of skilled and agricultural workers in Haiti.\n\n[[File:Sans Souci Palace.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the [[Sans-Souci Palace]], severely damaged in the 1842 earthquake and never rebuilt]]\nIn exchange for diplomatic recognition from France, Boyer was forced to pay a huge indemnity for the loss of French property during the revolution. To pay for this, he had to float loans in France, putting Haiti into a state of debt. Boyer attempted to enforce production through the ''Code Rural'', enacted in 1826, but peasant freeholders, mostly former revolutionary soldiers, had no intention of returning to the forced labor they fought to escape. By 1840, Haiti had ceased to export sugar entirely, although large amounts continued to be grown for local consumption as ''taffia''-a raw rum. However, Haiti continued to export coffee, which required little cultivation and grew semi-wild.\n\nThe [[1842 Cap-Ha\u00eftien earthquake]] destroyed the city, and the [[Sans-Souci Palace]], killing 10,000 people. This was the third major earthquake to hit Western Hispaniola following the 1751 and 1770 Port-au-Prince earthquakes, and the last until the devastating earthquake of 2010.\n\nHaiti went through a long period of oppression and instability following the presidency of Jean-Pierre Boyer. Likewise, in the Dominican Republic, a succession of [[caudillo|strongmen]] ruled harshly during the last half of the 19th century, crushed frequent uprisings, and repelled Haitian invasions.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Kohn|editor1-first=George Childs|title=Dictionary of Wars|date=2013|publisher=Routledge}}</ref>\n\n==Political struggles (1843\u20131915)==\n[[File:Sacre de l'empereur Faustin Soulouque.jpg|thumb|The coronation of [[Faustin I of Haiti]] in 1849]]\n\n[[File:Palais-National incendi\u00e9 par Salnave.jpg|thumb|The National Palace burned down during the revolt against Salnave in 1868]]\n\n[[File:Haiti German legation 1900.jpg|thumb|Staff of the German legation and the Hamburg-Amerika Line agency at Port-au-Prince, Haiti in 1900.

Revolts soon broke out and the country descended into near chaos, with a series of transient presidents until March 1847, when General [[Faustin I of Haiti|Faustin Soulouque]], a former slave who had fought in the rebellion of 1791, became president. He purged the military high command, established a secret police, and eliminated mulatto opponents. In August 1849, he grandiosely proclaimed himself as Haiti's second emperor, Faustin I. Soulouque's expansive ambitions led him to mount several invasions of the Dominican Republic. The new emperor had been called a ''rey de farsa'' by the Dominicans. The white and mulatto rulers of the Dominican Republic he considered as his \"natural\" enemies, and he could never consolidate his rule without this conquest, for his reign had been founded on domination and would stand only by it.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baur|first1=John E.|title=Faustin Soulouque, Emperor of Haiti His Character and His Reign|date=1949|page=143}}</ref> When in 1849 Soulouque led his first invasion into the Dominican Republic, President [[Buenaventura B\u00e1ez]] declared war on Haiti.

In January of the following year, a Haitian contingent of 6,000 soldiers was terribly defeated in the border town of Ouanaminthe.

When he rode into Port-au-Prince with what remained of his army he was loudly cursed by women who had lost their sons, brothers, and husbands in the war.<ref name=Smith/> Four years later, he was deposed by General [[Fabre Geffrard]], styled the Duke of Tabara.\n\nGeffrard's military government held office until 1867, and he encouraged a successful policy of national reconciliation. In 1860, he reached an agreement with the [[Roman Catholic Church|Vatican]], reintroducing official Roman Catholic institutions, including schools, to the nation. In 1867 an attempt was made to establish a constitutional government, but successive presidents [[Sylvain Salnave]] and [[Nissage Saget]] were overthrown in 1869 and 1874 respectively. A more workable constitution was introduced under [[Michel Domingue]] in 1874, leading to a long period of democratic peace and development for Haiti. The debt to France was finally repaid in 1879, and Michel Domingue's government peacefully transferred power to [[Lysius Salomon]], one of Haiti's abler leaders. Monetary reform and a cultural renaissance ensued with a flowering of Haitian art.\n\nThe last two decades of the 19th century were also marked by the development of a Haitian intellectual culture. Major works of history were published in 1847 and 1865. Haitian intellectuals, led by [[Louis-Joseph Janvier]] and [[Ant\u00e9nor Firmin]], engaged in a war of letters against a tide of racism and [[Social Darwinism]] that emerged during this period.\n\nThe Constitution of 1867 saw peaceful and progressive transitions in government that did much to improve the economy and stability of the Haitian nation and the condition of its people. Constitutional government restored the faith of the Haitian people in legal institutions. The development of industrial sugar and rum industries near [[Port-au-Prince]] made Haiti, for a while, a model for economic growth in Latin American countries.\nThis period of relative stability and prosperity ended in 1911, when revolution broke out and the country slid once again into disorder and debt.\n\nFrom 1911 to 1915, there were six different presidents, each of whom was killed or forced into exile.<ref>{{harvnb|Heinl|1996|p=791}}</ref> The revolutionary armies were formed by ''cacos'', peasant brigands from the mountains of the north, along the porous Dominican border, who were enlisted by rival political factions with promises of money to be paid after a successful revolution and an opportunity to plunder.\n\nThe United States was particularly apprehensive about the role of the German community in Haiti (approximately 200 in 1910), who wielded a disproportionate amount of economic power. Germans controlled about 80% of the country's international commerce; they also owned and operated utilities in Cap Ha\u00eftien and Port-au-Prince, the main [[wharf]] and a tramway in the capital, and a railroad serving the Plaine de Cul-du-Sac.\n\nThe German community proved more willing to integrate into Haitian society than any other group of white foreigners, including the French. A number married into the nation's most prominent mulatto families, bypassing the constitutional prohibition against foreign land-ownership. They also served as the principal financiers of the nation's innumerable revolutions, floating innumerable loans-at high interest rates-to competing political factions.\n\nIn an effort to limit German influence, in 1910\u201311, the US State Department backed a consortium of American investors, assembled by the [[Citibank|National City Bank of New York]], in acquiring control of the ''Banque Nationale d'Ha\u00efti'', the nation's only commercial bank and the government treasury.\n\nIn February 1915, [[Vilbrun Guillaume Sam]] established a dictatorship, but in July, facing a new revolt, he massacred 167 political prisoners, all of whom were from elite families, and was lynched by a mob in [[Port-au-Prince]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Fabre Geffrard (President d'Haiti 1859-1867).jpg|[[Fabre Geffrard]]\nFile:Charles Rivi\u00e8re-H\u00e9rard.jpg|[[Charles Rivi\u00e8re-H\u00e9rard]]\nFile:Michel Domingue (President d'Haiti 1874-1876).jpg|[[Michel Domingue]]\nFile:Salomon 200.jpg|[[Lysius Salomon]]\n</gallery>\n\n==United States occupation (1915\u201334)==\n{{See also|United States occupation of Haiti}}\n[[File:Occupation of Haiti.jpg|thumbnail|United States Marines and a Haitian guide patrolling the jungle in 1915 during the Battle of Fort Dipitie]]\n[[File:American Marines In 1915 defending the entrance gate in Cap-Haitian - 34510.jpg|thumb|American Marines in 1915 defending the entrance gate in Cap-Ha\u00eften]]\n[[File:Marines' base in Cap-Ha\u00eftien.jpg|thumb|Marine's base at Cap-Ha\u00eftien]]\n[[File:Inauguration du Mausol\u00e9e de P\u00e9tion et de Dessalines.jpg|thumb|Opening of the mausoleum of P\u00e9tion and Dessalines in 1926]]\n[[File:Bread market, St. Michel (Haiti) (15629128676).jpg|thumb|Bread market in St. Michel, 1928\u20131929]]\n\nIn 1915 the United States, responding to complaints to President [[Woodrow Wilson]] from American banks to which Haiti was deeply in debt, occupied the country. The [[United States occupation of Haiti|occupation of Haiti]] lasted until 1934. The US occupation was resented by Haitians as a loss of sovereignty and there were revolts against US forces. Reforms were carried out despite this.\n\nUnder the supervision of the United States Marines, the Haitian National Assembly elected [[Philippe Sudr\u00e9 Dartiguenave]] president. He signed a treaty that made Haiti a ''de jure'' US protectorate, with American officials assuming control over the Financial Advisory, Customs Receivership, the Constabulary, the Public Works Service, and the Public Health Service for a period of ten years. The principal instrument of American authority was the newly created ''Gendarmerie d'Ha\u00efti'', commanded by American officers. In 1917, at the demand of US officials, the National Assembly was dissolved, and officials were designated to write a new constitution, which was largely dictated by officials in the [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] and [[United States Department of the Navy|US Navy Department]]. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Under-Secretary for the Navy in the [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] administration, claimed to have personally written the new constitution. This document abolished the prohibition on foreign ownership of land \u2013 the most essential component of Haitian law. When the newly elected National Assembly refused to pass this document and drafted one of its own preserving this prohibition, it was forcibly dissolved by ''Gendarmerie'' commandant [[Smedley Butler]]. This constitution was approved by a plebiscite in 1919, in which less than 5% of the population voted. The US State Department authorized this plebiscite presuming that \"the people casting ballots would be 97% illiterate, ignorant in most cases of what they were voting for.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Hans Schmidt |title=The United States Occupation of Haiti, 1915\u20131934 |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |year=1971 |isbn=9780813522036 |page=99 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThe Marines and ''Gendarmerie'' initiated an extensive road-building program to enhance their military effectiveness and open the country to US investment. Lacking any source of adequate funds, they revived an 1864 Haitian law, discovered by Butler, requiring peasants to perform labor on local roads in lieu of paying a road tax. This system, known as the [[corv\u00e9e]], originated in the unpaid labor that French peasants provided to their [[feudalism|feudal]] lords. In 1915, Haiti had {{convert|3|mi}} of road usable by automobile, outside the towns. By 1918, more than {{convert|470|mi|km}} of road had been built or repaired through the corv\u00e9e system, including a road linking [[Port-au-Prince]] to [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]].<ref>{{harvnb|Heinl|1996|pp=430}}</ref> However, Haitians forced to work in the corv\u00e9e labor-gangs, frequently dragged from their homes and harassed by armed guards, received few immediate benefits and saw this system of forced labor as a return to slavery at the hands of white men.\n\nIn 1919, a new ''caco'' uprising began, led by [[Charlemagne P\u00e9ralte]], vowing to 'drive the invaders into the sea and free Haiti.'<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Max Boot |last=Boot |first=Max |title=The Savage Wars of Peace: Small Wars and the Rise of American Power |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=046500721X |lccn=2004695066 |year=2003 |page=173}}</ref> The Cacos [[Battle of Port-au-Prince (1919)|attacked Port-au-Prince]] in October but were driven back with heavy casualties. Afterwards, a [[Haitian Creole language|Creole]]-speaking American ''Gendarmerie'' officer and two US marines infiltrated P\u00e9ralte's camp, killing him and photographing his corpse in an attempt to demoralize the rebels. Leadership of the rebellion passed to Beno\u00eet Batraville, a Caco chieftain from [[Artibonite (department)|Artibonite]], who also launched an [[Battle of Port-au-Prince (1920)|assault on the capital]]. His death in 1920 marked the end of hostilities. During Senate hearings in 1921, the commandant of the Marine Corps reported that, in the twenty months of active resistance, 2,250 Haitians had been killed. However, in a report to the Secretary of the Navy he reported the death toll as being 3,250.<ref>{{harvnb|Schmidt|1971|p=102}}</ref> Haitian historians have estimated the true number was much higher; one suggested, \"the total number of battle victims and casualties of repression and consequences of the war might have reached, by the end of the pacification period, four or five times that \u2013 somewhere in the neighborhood of 15,000 persons.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Farmer |authorlink=Paul Farmer |title=The Uses of Haiti |publisher=Common Courage Press |year=2003 |page=98}}</ref>\n\nIn 1922, Dartiguenave was replaced by [[Louis Borno]], who ruled without a legislature until 1930. That same year, General [[John H. Russell, Jr.]], was appointed High Commissioner. The Borno-Russel dictatorship oversaw the expansion of the economy, building over {{convert|1000|mi|km}} of road, establishing an automatic telephone exchange, modernizing the nation's port facilities, and establishing a public health service. [[Sisal]] was introduced to Haiti, and sugar and cotton became significant exports.<ref>{{harvnb|Heinl|1996|pp=454\u201355}}</ref> However, efforts to develop commercial agriculture had limited success, in part because much of Haiti's labor force was employed at seasonal work in the more established sugar industries of [[Cuba]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. An estimated 30,000\u201340,000 Haitian laborers, known as ''braceros'', went annually to the [[Oriente Province]] of Cuba between 1913 and 1931.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Bridget |last1=Woodling |first2=Richard |last2=Moseley-Williams |title=Needed but unwanted: Haitian Immigrants and their Descendants in the Dominican Republic |publisher=Catholic Institute for International Relations |place=London |year=2004 |page=24}}</ref> Most Haitians continued to resent the loss of sovereignty.

In December 1929, Marines in [[Les Cayes]] killed ten Haitians during a march to protest local economic conditions. This led [[Herbert Hoover]] to appoint two commissions, including one headed by a former US governor of the [[Philippines]] [[William Cameron Forbes]], which criticized the exclusion of Haitians from positions of authority in the government and constabulary, now known as the ''Garde d'Ha\u00efti''. In 1930, [[St\u00e9nio Vincent]], a long-time critic of the occupation, was elected president, and the US began to withdraw its forces. The withdrawal was completed under US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (FDR), in 1934, under his \"[[Good Neighbor policy]]\". The US retained control of Haiti's external finances until 1947.<ref>{{harvnb|Schmidt|1971|p=232}}</ref> All three rulers during the occupation came from the country's small [[mulatto]] minority. At the same time, many in the growing black professional classes departed from the traditional veneration of Haiti's French cultural heritage and emphasized the nation's African roots, most notably ethnologist [[Jean Price-Mars]] and the journal ''Les Griots'', edited by Dr. [[Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=San Miguel |first1=Pedro Luis |title=Imagined Island : History, Identity, and Utopia in Hispaniola |date=2005-09-30 |publisher=The University of North Carolina Press |isbn=9780807829646 |page=68\u201369}}</ref>\n\nThe transition government was left with a better infrastructure, public health, education, and agricultural development as well as a democratic system. The country had fully democratic elections in 1930, won by [[St\u00e9nio Vincent]]. The Garde was a new kind of military institution in Haiti. It was a force manned overwhelmingly by blacks, with a United States-trained black commander, Colonel D\u00e9mosth\u00e8nes P\u00e9trus Calixte. Most of the Garde's officers, however, were mulattoes. The Garde was a national organization;<ref name=oavommo /> it departed from the regionalism that had characterized most of Haiti's previous armies. In theory, its charge was apolitical\u2014to maintain internal order, while supporting a popularly elected government. The Garde initially adhered to this role.<ref name=oavommo>http://countrystudies.us/haiti/16.htm</ref>\n\n==Elections and coups (1934\u201357)==\n\n[[File:Stenio Vincent portrait.jpg|thumb|[[St\u00e9nio Vincent]]]]\n\n===Vincent's presidency (1934\u201341)===\nPresident Vincent took advantage of the comparative national stability, which was being maintained by a professionalized military, to gain absolute power. A plebiscite permitted the transfer of all authority in economic matters from the legislature to the executive, but Vincent was not content with this expansion of his power. In 1935 he forced through the legislature a new constitution, which was also approved by plebiscite. The constitution praised Vincent, and it granted the executive sweeping powers to dissolve the legislature at will, to reorganize the judiciary, to appoint ten of twenty-one senators (and to recommend the remaining eleven to the lower house), and to rule by decree when the legislature was not in session. Although Vincent implemented some improvements in infrastructure and services, he brutally repressed his opposition, censored the press, and governed largely to benefit himself and a clique of merchants and corrupt military officers.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nUnder Calixte the majority of Garde personnel had adhered to the doctrine of political nonintervention that their Marine Corps trainers had stressed. Over time, however, Vincent and Dominican dictator [[Rafael Trujillo|Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo Molina]] sought to buy adherents among the ranks. Trujillo, determined to expand his influence over all of Hispaniola, in October 1937 ordered the indiscriminate butchery by the Dominican army of an estimated 14,000 to 40,000<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barsamian |first1=David |title=Louder Than Bombs: Interviews from the Progressive Magazine |date=2004 |publisher=South End Press |page=3 |isbn=9780896087255 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zWQkIPrIAAsC&pg=PA3&lpg=#v=onepage}}</ref> Haitians on the Dominican side of the [[Dajab\u00f3n River|Massacre River]]. Some observers claim that Trujillo supported an abortive coup attempt by young Garde officers in December 1937. Vincent dismissed Calixte as commander and sent him abroad, where he eventually accepted a commission in the Dominican military as a reward for his efforts while on Trujillo's payroll. The attempted coup led Vincent to purge the officer corps of all members suspected of disloyalty,  marking the end of the apolitical military.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n===Lescot's presidency (1941\u201346)===\n\n[[File:Elie Lescot portrait.jpg |thumb|[[\u00c9lie Lescot]]]]\n\nIn 1941 Vincent showed every intention of standing for a third term as president, but after almost a decade of disengagement, the United States made it known that it would oppose such an extension. Vincent accommodated the Roosevelt administration and handed power over to [[Elie Lescot]].<ref name=oavommo />\n\nLescot was a mulatto who had served in numerous government posts. He was competent and forceful, and many considered him a sterling candidate for the presidency, despite his elitist background. Like the majority of previous Haitian presidents, however, he failed to live up to his potential. His tenure paralleled that of Vincent in many ways. Lescot declared himself commander in chief of the military, and power resided in a clique that ruled with the tacit support of the Garde. He repressed his opponents, censored the press, and compelled the legislature to grant him extensive powers. He handled all budget matters without legislative sanction and filled legislative vacancies without calling elections. Lescot commonly said that Haiti's declared state-of-war against the Axis powers during World War II justified his repressive actions. Haiti, however, played no role in the war except for supplying the United States with raw materials and serving as a base for a United States Coast Guard detachment.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nAside from his authoritarian tendencies, Lescot had another flaw: his relationship with [[Rafael Trujillo]]. While serving as Haitian ambassador to the [[Dominican Republic]], Lescot fell under the sway of Trujillo's influence and wealth. In fact, it was Trujillo's money that reportedly bought most of the legislative votes that brought Lescot to power. Their clandestine association persisted until 1943, when the two leaders parted ways for unknown reasons. Trujillo later made public all his correspondence with the Haitian leader. The move undermined Lescot's already dubious popular support.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nIn January 1946, events came to a head when Lescot jailed the Marxist editors of a journal called ''La Ruche'' (The Beehive). This action precipitated student strikes and protests by government workers, teachers, and shopkeepers in the capital and provincial cities. In addition, Lescot's mulatto-dominated rule had alienated the predominantly black Garde. His position became untenable, and he resigned on 11 January. Radio announcements declared that the Garde had assumed power, which it would administer through a three-member junta.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n===Revolution of 1946===\n[[File:\"TOGETHER AGAIN FOR FREEDOM^\" - NARA - 535669.tif|thumb|\"Together again for freedom\", 1943 U.S. leaflet]]\n\nThe Revolution of 1946 was a novel development in Haiti's history, as the Garde assumed power as an institution, not as the instrument of a particular commander. The members of the junta, known as the Military Executive Committee (Comit\u00e9 Ex\u00e9cutif Militaire), were Garde commander [[Franck Lavaud|Colonel Franck Lavaud]], [[Antoine Levelt|Major Antoine Levelt]], and [[Paul E. Magloire|Major Paul E. Magloire]], commander of the Presidential Guard. All three understood Haiti's traditional way of exercising power, but they lacked a thorough understanding of what would be required to make the transition to an elected civilian government. Upon taking power, the junta pledged to hold free elections. The junta also explored other options, but public clamor, which included public demonstrations in support of potential candidates, eventually forced the officers to make good on their promise.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nHaiti elected its National Assembly in May 1946. The Assembly set 16 August 1946, as the date on which it would select a president. The leading candidates for the office\u2014all of whom were black\u2014were [[Dumarsais Estim\u00e9]], a former school teacher, assembly member, and cabinet minister under Vincent; [[F\u00e9lix d'Orl\u00e9ans Juste Constant]], leader of the [[Haitian Communist Party]] (Parti Communiste d'Ha\u00efti\u2014PCH); and former Garde commander [[D\u00e9mosth\u00e8nes P\u00e9trus Calixte]], who stood as the candidate of a progressive coalition that included the Worker Peasant Movement (Mouvement Ouvrier Paysan\u2014MOP). MOP chose to endorse Calixte, instead of a candidate from its own ranks, because the party's leader, [[Daniel Fignol\u00e9]], was only thirty-three years old\u2014too young to stand for the nation's highest office. Estim\u00e9, politically the most moderate of the three, drew support from the black population in the north, as well as from the emerging black middle class. The leaders of the military, who would not countenance the election of Juste Constant and who reacted warily to the populist Fignol\u00e9, also considered Estim\u00e9 the safest candidate. After two rounds of polling, legislators gave Estim\u00e9 the presidency.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n===Estim\u00e9's presidency (1946\u201350)===\n[[File:Dumarsais estime portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Dumarsais Estim\u00e9]] ]]\nEstim\u00e9's election represented a break with Haiti's political tradition. Although he was reputed to have received support from commanders of the Garde, Estim\u00e9 was a civilian. Of humble origins, he was passionately anti-elitist and therefore generally antimulatto. He demonstrated, at least initially, a genuine concern for the welfare of the people. Operating under a new constitution that went into effect in November 1946, Estim\u00e9 proposed, but never secured passage of, Haiti's first social- security legislation. He did, however, expand the school system, encourage the establishment of rural cooperatives, raise the salaries of civil servants, and increase the representation of middle-class and lower-class blacks in the public sector. He also attempted to gain the favor of the Garde\u2014renamed the Haitian Army (Arm\u00e9e d'Ha\u00efti) in March 1947\u2014by promoting Lavaud to brigadier general and by seeking United States military assistance.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nEstim\u00e9 eventually fell victim to two of the time-honored pitfalls of Haitian rule: elite intrigue and personal ambition. The elite had a number of grievances against Estim\u00e9. Not only had he largely excluded them from the often lucrative levers of government, but he also enacted the country's first income tax, fostered the growth of labor unions, and suggested that vodou be considered as a religion equivalent to Roman Catholicism\u2014a notion that the Europeanized elite abhorred. Lacking direct influence in Haitian affairs, the elite resorted to clandestine lobbying among the officer corps. Their efforts, in combination with deteriorating domestic conditions, led to a coup in May 1950.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nTo be sure, Estim\u00e9 had hastened his own demise in several ways. His nationalization of the Standard Fruit banana concession sharply reduced the firm's revenues. He alienated workers by requiring them to invest between 10 percent and 15 percent of their salaries in national-defense bonds. The president sealed his fate by attempting to manipulate the constitution in order to extend his term in office. Seizing on this action and the popular unrest it engendered, the army forced the president to resign on 10 May 1950. The same junta that had assumed power after the fall of Lescot reinstalled itself. An army escort conducted Estim\u00e9 from the National Palace and into exile in Jamaica. The events of May 1946 made an impression upon the deposed minister of labor, Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier. The lesson that Duvalier drew from Estim\u00e9's ouster was that the military could not be trusted. It was a lesson that he would act upon when he gained power.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n===Magloire's presidency (1950\u201356)===\n[[File:Paul Magloire portrait.jpg |thumb|[[Paul Magloire]] ]]\n\nThe power balance within the junta shifted between 1946 and 1950. Lavaud was the preeminent member at the time of the first coup, but Magloire, now a colonel, dominated after Estim\u00e9's overthrow. When Haiti announced that its first direct elections (all men twenty-one or over were allowed to vote) would be held on 8 October 1950, Magloire resigned from the junta and declared himself a candidate for president. In contrast to the chaotic political climate of 1946, the campaign of 1950 proceeded under the implicit understanding that only a strong candidate backed by both the army and the elite would be able to take power. Facing only token opposition, Magloire won the election and assumed office on 6 December.<ref name=oavommo />\n\nMagloire restored the elite to prominence. The business community and the government benefited from favorable economic conditions until Hurricane Hazel hit the island in 1954. Haiti made some improvements on its infrastructure, but most of these were financed largely by foreign loans. By Haitian standards, Magloire's rule was firm, but not harsh: he jailed political opponents, including Fignol\u00e9, and shut down their presses when their protests grew too strident, but he allowed labor unions to function, although they were not permitted to strike. It was in the arena of corruption, however, that Magloire overstepped traditional bounds. The president controlled the sisal, cement, and soap monopolies. He and other officials built imposing mansions. The injection of international hurricane relief funds into an already corrupt system boosted graft to levels that disillusioned all Haitians. To make matters worse, Magloire followed in the footsteps of many previous presidents by disputing the termination date of his stay in office. Politicians, labor leaders, and their followers flocked to the streets in May 1956 to protest Magloire's failure to step down. Although Magloire declared martial law, a general strike essentially shut down Port-au-Prince. Again like many before him, Magloire fled to Jamaica, leaving the army with the task of restoring order.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n===The rise of Duvalier (1956\u201357)===\nThe period between the fall of Magloire and the election of Duvalier in September 1957 was a chaotic one, even by Haitian standards. Three provisional presidents held office during this interval; one resigned and the army deposed the other two, Franck Sylvain and Fignol\u00e9. Duvalier is said to have engaged actively in the behind-the-scenes intrigue that helped him to emerge as the presidential candidate that the military favored. The military went on to guide the campaign and the elections in a way that gave Duvalier every possible advantage. Most political actors perceived Duvalier\u2014a medical doctor who had served as a rural administrator of a United States-funded anti-yaws campaign before entering the cabinet under Estim\u00e9\u2014as an honest and fairly unassuming leader without a strong ideological motivation or program. When elections were finally organized, this time under terms of universal suffrage (both men and women now had the vote), Duvalier, a black, painted himself as the legitimate heir to Estim\u00e9. This approach was enhanced by the fact that Duvalier's only viable opponent, [[Louis D\u00e9joie]], was a mulatto and the scion of a prominent family. Duvalier scored a decisive victory at the polls. His followers took two-thirds of the legislature's lower house and all of the seats in the Senate.<ref name=oavommo />\n\n==The Duvalier era (1957\u201386)==\n{{main|Duvalier dynasty}}\n\n==='Papa Doc' (1957\u201371)===\n[[File:Duvalier (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier]] in 1968]]\nA former Minister of Health who had earned a reputation as a humanitarian while serving as an administrator in a U.S.-funded anti-[[yaws]] campaign, [[Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier]] (known as ''\"Papa Doc\"'') soon established another dictatorship. His regime is regarded as one of the most repressive and corrupt of modern times, combining violence against political opponents with exploitation of [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] to instill fear in the majority of the population. Duvalier's paramilitary police, officially the Volunteers for National Security (Volontaires de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Nationale \u2013 VSN) but more commonly known as the [[Tonton Macoute]]s, named for a Vodou monster, carried out political murders, beatings, and intimidation. An estimated 30,000 Haitians were killed by his government.<ref>{{citation |publisher=Country studies |place=US |url=http://countrystudies.us/haiti/17.htm |series=Haiti |title=Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier, 1957\u201371}}</ref> [[Sexual violence in Haiti|Duvalier employed rape]] as a political tool to silence political opposition.<ref>{{cite book |last=Girard |first=Philippe |title=Haiti: The Tumultuous History \u2013 From Pearl of the Caribbean to Broken Nation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L5KnihgGoIMC&pg=PA139 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |date=14 September 2010 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-230-11290-2 |ref=harv}}</ref> Incorporating many ''[[houngan]]s'' into the ranks of the Macoutes, his public recognition of Vodou and its practitioners and his private adherence to Vodou ritual, combined with his reputed private knowledge of magic and sorcery, enhanced his popular persona among the common people and served as a peculiar form of legitimization.\n\nDuvalier's policies, designed to end the dominance of the mulatto elite over the nation's economic and political life, led to massive emigration of educated people, deepening Haiti's economic and social problems. However, Duvalier appealed to the black middle class of which he was a member by introducing public works into middle-class neighborhoods that previously had been unable to have paved roads, running water, or modern sewage systems. In 1964, Duvalier proclaimed himself \"President for Life\".\n\nThe [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration suspended aid in 1961, after allegations that Duvalier had pocketed aid money and intended to use a [[Marine (military)|Marine Corps]] mission to strengthen the Macoutes. Duvalier also clashed with Dominican President [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]] in 1963, after Bosch provided aid and asylum to Haitian exiles working to overthrow his regime. He ordered the Presidential Guard to occupy the Dominican chancery in [[P\u00e9tion-Ville]] to apprehend an officer involved in a plot to kidnap his children, leading Bosch to publicly threaten to invade Haiti. However, the Dominican army, which distrusted Bosch's leftist leanings, expressed little support for an invasion, and the dispute was settled by [[Organization of American States|OAS]] emissaries.\n\nIn 1971, Papa Doc entered into a 99-year contract with [[Don Pierson]] representing Dupont Caribbean Inc. of Texas for a [[free port]] project on the old [[buccaneer]] stronghold of [[Freeport Tortuga|Tortuga]] island located some {{convert|10|mi}} off the north coast of the main Haitian island of Hispaniola.\n\n==='Baby Doc' (1971\u201386)===\n[[File:Fleeing Duvaliers.jpg|thumb|Jean-Claude and Mich\u00e8le Duvalier en route to the airport to flee the country, 7 February 1986]]\n\nOn Duvalier's death in April 1971, power passed to his 19-year-old son [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]] (known as ''\"Baby Doc\"''). Under Jean-Claude Duvalier, Haiti's economic and political condition continued to decline, although some of the more fearsome elements of his father's regime were abolished. Foreign officials and observers also seemed more tolerant toward Baby Doc, in areas such as human-rights monitoring, and foreign countries were more generous to him with economic assistance. The United States restored its aid program in 1971. In 1974, Baby Doc expropriated the Freeport Tortuga project and this caused the venture to collapse. Content to leave administrative matters in the hands of his mother, Simone Ovid Duvalier, while living as a playboy, Jean-Claude enriched himself through a series of fraudulent schemes. Much of the Duvaliers' wealth, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars over the years, came from the R\u00e9gie du Tabac (Tobacco Administration), a tobacco monopoly established by Estim\u00e9, which expanded to include the proceeds from all government enterprises and served as a slush fund for which no balance sheets were ever kept.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://countrystudies.us/haiti/18.htm |publisher=Country studies |place=US |series=Haiti |title=Jean-Claude Duvalier, 1971\u201386}}</ref> His marriage, in 1980, to a beautiful mulatto divorc\u00e9e, [[Mich\u00e8le Bennett]], in a $3&nbsp;million ceremony, provoked widespread opposition, as it was seen as a betrayal of his father's antipathy towards the mulatto elite. At the request of Mich\u00e8le, Papa Doc's widow Simone was expelled from Haiti. Baby Doc's [[kleptocracy]] left the regime vulnerable to unanticipated crises, exacerbated by endemic poverty, most notably the epidemic of [[African swine fever virus]]\u2014which, at the insistence of [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] officials, led to the slaughter of the [[Creole Pig|creole pigs]], the principal source of income for most Haitians; and the widely publicized outbreak of AIDS in the early 1980s. Widespread discontent in Haiti began in 1983, when [[Pope John Paul II]] condemned the regime during a visit, finally provoking a rebellion, and in February 1986, after months of disorder, the army forced Duvalier to resign and go into exile.\n\n==The struggle for democracy (1986\u2013present day)==\n[[File:Fishing village in Haiti.jpg|thumb|Fishing village in Haiti, 1996]]\n[[File:Shopping streetin Haiti.jpg|thumb|Market street in Port-au-Prince, 1996]]\n\n===Transitional government (1986\u201390)===\nFrom 1986 to early 1988 Haiti was ruled by a provisional military government under General Namphy.

Various initiatives to end the political crisis through the peaceful restoration of the constitutionally elected government failed. In July 1994, as repression mounted in Haiti and a civilian human rights monitoring mission was expelled from the country, the United Nations Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 940]], which authorized member states to use all necessary means to facilitate the departure of Haiti's military leadership and to restore Haiti's constitutionally elected government to power.\n\n[[File:DD-SD-99-03743.jpg|thumb|President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returns triumphantly to the National Palace at Port-au-Prince, Haiti in 1994]]\n\n===The return of Aristide (1994\u201396)===\nIn mid-September 1994, with U.S. troops prepared to enter Haiti by force for [[Operation Uphold Democracy]], President [[Bill Clinton]] dispatched a negotiating team led by former President [[Jimmy Carter]] to persuade the authorities to step aside and allow for the return of constitutional rule. With intervening troops already airborne, C\u00e9dras and other top leaders agreed to step down. In October, Aristide was able to return. The [[Haitian general election, 1995]] in June 1995 saw Aristide's coalition, the Lavalas (Waterfall) Political Organization, gain a sweeping victory, and [[Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val]], a prominent Aristide political ally, elected President with 88% of the vote. When Aristide's term ended in February 1996, this was Haiti's first ever transition between two democratically elected presidents.\n\n===Preval's first Presidency (1996\u20132001)===\n[[File:U.S. Coast Guard intercepting Haitian refugees.GIF|thumb|U.S. Coast Guard intercepting Haitian refugees, 1998]]\n\n[[File:Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val on March 31, 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val]]]]\n\nIn late 1996, Aristide broke with Pr\u00e9val and formed a new political party, the Lavalas Family ([[Fanmi Lavalas]], FL), which won [[Haitian legislative election, 1997|elections in April 1997]] for one-third of the Senate and local assemblies, but these results were not accepted by the government. The split between Aristide and Pr\u00e9val produced a dangerous political deadlock, and the government was unable to organize the local and parliamentary elections due in late 1998. In January 1999, Pr\u00e9val dismissed legislators whose terms had expired \u2013 the entire Chamber of Deputies and all but nine members of the Senate, and Pr\u00e9val then ruled by decree.\n\n===Aristide's second presidency (2001\u201304)===\nIn May 2000 the [[Haitian legislative election, 2000]] for the Chamber of Deputies and two-thirds of the Senate took place. The election drew a voter turnout of more than 60%, and the FL won a virtual sweep. However, the elections were marred by controversy in the Senate race over the calculation of whether Senate candidates had achieved the majority required to avoid a run-off election (in Haiti, seats where no candidate wins an absolute majority of votes cast has to enter a second-round run-off election). The validity of the Electoral Council's post-ballot calculations of whether a majority had been attained was disputed. The [[Organization of American States]] complained about the calculation and declined to observe the July run-off elections. The opposition parties, regrouped in the Democratic Convergence ([[Convergence D\u00e9mocratique]], CD), demanded that the elections be annulled, and that Pr\u00e9val stand down and be replaced by a provisional government. In the meantime, the opposition announced it would boycott the [[Haitian presidential election, 2000|November presidential and senatorial elections]]. Haiti's main aid donors threatened to cut off aid. At the November 2000 elections, boycotted by the opposition, Aristide was again elected president, with more than 90% of the vote, on a turnout of around 50% according to international observers. The opposition refused to accept the result or to recognize Aristide as president.\n\nAllegations emerged of drug trafficking reaching into the upper echelons of government, as it had done under the military regimes of the 1980s and early 1990s ([[illegal drug trade in Haiti]]). Canadian police arrested Oriel Jean, Aristide's security chief and one of his most trusted friends, for money laundering.<ref>[http://www.sptimes.com/2004/04/03/Worldandnation/Taint_of_drugs_reachi.shtml Taint of drugs reaching Haiti's upper echelons]</ref> Beaudoin Ketant, a notorious international drug trafficker, Aristide's close partner, and his daughter's godfather, claimed that Aristide \"turned the country into a narco-country; it's a one-man show; you either pay (Aristide) or you die\".<ref>[[BBC]], 19 March 2004, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3524444.stm Haiti's drug money scourge]</ref>\n\nAristide spent years negotiating with the [[Convergence D\u00e9mocratique]] on new elections, but the Convergence's inability to develop a sufficient electoral base made elections unattractive, and it rejected every deal offered, preferring to call for a US invasion to topple Aristide.\n\n===The 2004 coup d'\u00e9tat===\n{{Main|2004 Haitian coup d'\u00e9tat}}\nAnti-Aristide protests in January 2004 led to violent clashes in Port-au-Prince, causing several deaths. In February, a revolt broke out in the city of [[Gona\u00efves]], which was soon under rebel control. The rebellion then began to spread, and Cap-Ha\u00eftien, Haiti's second-largest city, was captured. A mediation team of diplomats presented a plan to reduce Aristide's power while allowing him to remain in office until the end of his constitutional term. Although Aristide accepted the plan, it was rejected by the opposition, which mostly consisted of Haitian businessmen and former members of the army (who sought to reinstate the military following Aristide's disbandment of it).\n[[File:Port-au-Prince med.jpg|thumbnail|U.S. Marines patrol the streets of Port-au-Prince on 9 March 2004]]\nOn 29 February 2004, with rebel contingents marching towards Port-au-Prince, Aristide departed from Haiti. Aristide insists that he was essentially kidnapped by the U.S., while the U.S. [[United States Department of State|State Department]] maintains that he resigned from office. Aristide and his wife left Haiti on an American airplane, escorted by American diplomats and military personnel, and were flown directly to [[Bangui]], capital of the [[Central African Republic]], where he stayed for the following two weeks, before seeking [[right of asylum|asylum]] in a less remote location. This event was later characterized by Aristide as a kidnapping.\n\nThough this has never been proven, many observers in the press and academia believe that the US has not provided convincing answers to several of the more suspicious details surrounding the coup, such as the circumstances under which the US obtained Aristide's purported letter of \"resignation\" (as presented by the US) which, translated from [[Krey\u00f2l]], may not have actually read as a resignation.<ref name=\"Hallward2008\">{{cite web|url=http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/63/63-Resignation.pdf |title=Did he Jump or was he Pushed? |work=Press for Conversion! |year=2008 |pages=31\u201337 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630054053/http://coat.ncf.ca/our_magazine/links/63/63-Resignation.pdf |archive-date=30 June 2013 |url-status=live |first=Peter |last=Hallward |author-link=Peter Hallward |publisher=Coalition to Oppose the Arms Trade |location=Ottawa |issue=63 |issn=1183-8892 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAristide has accused the U.S. of deposing him in concert with the Haitian opposition.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/americas/03/01/aristide.claim/ |title=Aristide says U.S. deposed him in 'coup d'\u00e9tat' |publisher=CNN |date=2 March 2004 |accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> In a 2006 interview, he said the U.S. went back on their word regarding compromises he made with them over privatization of enterprises to ensure that part of the profits would go to the Haitian people and then \"relied on a disinformation campaign\" to discredit him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=55&ItemID=12166 |date=19 February 2007 |quote=Aristide's interview was conducted in French, in Pretoria, on 20 July 2006; originally published in London Review of Books |title=An Interview with Jean-Bertrand Aristide |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070222050105/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=55&ItemID=12166 |archivedate=2007-02-22 |accessdate=10 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nPolitical organizations and writers, as well as Aristide himself, have suggested that the rebellion was in fact a foreign controlled coup d'\u00e9tat. [[Caribbean Community|Caricom]], which had been backing the peace deal, accused the United States, France, and the International community of failing in Haiti because they allegedly allowed a controversially elected leader to be violently forced out of office. The international community stated that the crisis was of Aristide's making and that he was not acting in the best interests of his country. They have argued that his removal was necessary for future stability in the island nation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nSome investigators claimed to have discovered extensive [[embezzlement]], corruption, and [[money laundering]] by Aristide.

The earthquake caused massive devastation, with most buildings crumbled, including Haiti's presidential palace. The enormous death toll made it necessary to bury the dead in mass graves. Most bodies were unidentified and few pictures were taken, making it impossible for families to identify their loved ones. The spread of disease was a major secondary disaster.

On one hand, he and his associates were accused of being involved in money laundering and various other crimes resulting in countless demonstrations (which on many occasions would become violent). Many criticized him for the slow progression of the reconstruction phase following the recent quake, or for taking credit for projects started in previous administrations. Some disliked him for his vulgar language and risque past which didn't seem to completely go away upon taking presidency. On the other hand, many believe that he was the most productive Haitian president since the Duvalier era. Under his administration, the majority of those left homeless following the quake were given new housing. He offered free education programs to large portions of the Haitian youth as well as an income program for Haitian mothers and students. The administration launched a massive reconstruction program involving principle administration district, Champs-de-Mars, that would modernize and rehabilitate various government buildings, public places, and parks. Michel Martelly put emphasis on foreign investment and business with his slogan \"Haiti is Open for Business\". Perhaps one of the more major contributions made for the revitalization of the Haitian economy was their push for tourists. Minister of Tourism, [[St\u00e9phanie Villedrouin]], embarked on various competitive tourist projects, including the development of Ile-a-Vache, Jacmel, the north, south-west, and Cotes-des-Arcadins.

It may include equipment and cabling external to the weapon or weapon system to activate components within the weapon or weapon system.}}\n\nThe earliest PALs were little more than locks introduced into the control and firing systems of a nuclear weapon, that would inhibit either the detonation, or the removal of [[Nuclear weapon design|safety features]] of the weapon. More recent innovations have included [[encrypted]] firing parameters, which must be decrypted to properly detonate the [[warhead]], plus [[anti-handling device|anti-tamper systems]] which intentionally mis-detonate the weapon, destroying it without giving rise to a nuclear explosion.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\n[[File:Sandia-Building800-1951.gif|thumbnail|right|[[Sandia National Laboratories]], 1951. Sandia was instrumental from the beginning in developing PALs.]]\n\nPermissive Action Links were developed in the [[United States]] over a gradual process from the [[Nuclear weapons testing|first use of atomic weapons]] to the early 1960s. Importantly, in 1953 the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] signed the ''Missiles and Rockets Agreement'', which paved the way for the development and implementation of PALs. Certain national laboratories, under the auspices of the AEC, would develop and produce nuclear weapons, while the responsibility for the use and deployment remained with the military. The laboratories were also free to conduct their own research in the field of arms control and security. The thinking behind this was that if the government would ever be interested in such a security device, the research and development of prototypes would already be well advanced. At the beginning of the 1960s, the desire for the usage of such a system grew for both political and technological reasons.\n\nNewer nuclear weapons were simpler in their operation and were produced en masse and were less cumbersome to arm and use than previous designs. Accordingly, new controls were necessary to prevent their unauthorized use. As the [[Cold War]] came to a head in the 1960s, the government felt it best not to leave the use of nuclear weapons in the hands of possibly-renegade generals, including the commander of [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC).<ref>Richard Rhodes: ''Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb''. Simon & Schuster, New York 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-684-81690-6}}.</ref> Without Permissive Action Links, nuclear weapons were effectively under the independent command of a number of generals.\n\n{{quote|I used to worry about the fact that <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Thomas S. Power|General Power]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> had control over so many weapons and weapon systems and could, under certain conditions, launch the force. Back in the days before we had real positive control [i.e., PAL locks], SAC had the power to do a lot of things, and it was in his hands, and he knew it. |sign=[[Horace M. Wade|General Horace M.

Harvard University Press, Cambridge 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-674-01761-0}}, S.&nbsp;151.</ref>}}\n\nIn order to protect its [[NATO]] allies, the United States had stationed various nuclear weapons overseas; these weapons were thus at least under the partial control of the hosting allied state. This was especially concerning to the [[United States Congress]], as this lack of control was in violation of federal law. Added to this was the fact that some of the allies were considered potentially unstable\u2014particularly [[West Germany]] and [[Turkey]].<ref name=\"Assuring Control\">Peter Stein, Peter Feaver: ''Assuring Control of Nuclear Weapons: The Evolution of Permissive Action Links''. University Press of America, Lanham 1989, {{ISBN|978-0-8191-6337-0}}.</ref> There was considerable concern that in one of these countries the instructions of the civilian leadership of the host country could overrule the military. In addition, the U.S. realized that in the event of war, parts of West Germany would be [[Fulda gap#In the Cold War|overwhelmed early on]], and nuclear weapons stationed there could fall into the hands of the Soviet Union.\n\nFor a long time the U.S. military resisted the use of PALs. It feared the loss of independence and feared malfunction, which could put warheads out of action in a time of crisis. But the advantages of PALs outweighed the disadvantages: thanks to the PALs weapons were able to be distributed to a greater extent in Europe, so as to prevent a rapid and selective destruction or conquest by the Soviet bloc, while still retaining U.S. control over the farther-flung weapons.<ref name=\"Assuring Control\" />\n\n=== Development and dissemination ===\nThe precursors of Permissive Action Links were simple mechanical [[combination lock]]s that were set into the control systems of nuclear weapons, such as the [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman]] [[ICBM]]. There they could perform different functions: some blocked the cavity through which the nuclear materials were [[Gun-type fission weapon|shot]] to create a reaction; other locks blocked circuits; and some simply prevented access to the control panel. For testing, some of these mechanisms were installed during 1959 in weapons stationed in Europe.<ref>''Weapon Dispersal without Fear of Unauthorized Use.'' In: ''Sandia Lab News'', Family Day Special Edition, Bd.&nbsp;38 Nr.&nbsp;20, 1986, S.&nbsp;4.</ref>\n\nThe work on PAL prototypes remained at low levels until 1960. [[Sandia National Laboratories]] (SNL) successfully created a number of new combination locks that were adaptable to different types of weapons. In the spring of 1961, there was a series of hearings in Congress, where Sandia presented the prototype of a special electro-mechanical lock, which was then known still as a \"Proscribed Action Link.\"  The military leadership, however, soon realized that this term had negative connotations for the use of weapons by the officer corps (proscribed = \"prohibited\"), and changed the meaning of PAL to \"Permissive Action Link\" (permissive = \"allowing / tolerating\").{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n[[File:NSAM 160.jpg|thumb|right| National Security Action Memorandum 160: introduction of PAL to all U.S. nuclear weapons under [[NATO]] command]]\n\nIn June 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy]] signed the [[Presidential directive|National Security Action Memorandum]] number 160. This presidential directive ordered the installation of PALs in all U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe. All other U.S. nuclear weapons were excluded at that time. The conversion was completed September 1962 and cost $23 million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|23000000|1962|r=-6}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}).\n\nAccording to nuclear safety expert [[Bruce G. Blair]], the US Air Force's [[Strategic Air Command]] worried that in times of need the codes for the Minuteman ICBM force would not be available, so it quietly decided to set the codes to 00000000 in all [[missile launch control center]]s. Blair said the missile launch checklists included an item confirming this combination until 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.org/blair/permissive-action-links.cfm |title=Keeping Presidents in the Nuclear Dark (Episode #1: The Case of the Missing \"Permissive Action Links\") - Bruce G.

In 1974, U.S. Defense Secretary [[James Schlesinger]] found that a variety of tactical nuclear weapons were still not fitted with Permissive Action Links, even though the technology had been available for some time.<ref name=\"Insider\">Thomas C. Reed: ''At the Abyss: An Insider\u2019s History of the Cold War.'' Presidio Press, New York 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-89141-837-5}}.</ref> It took another two years until all the tactical nuclear weapons were fully equipped with PALs. In 1981, almost 20 years after the invention of PALs, just over half of U.S. nuclear weapons were still equipped only with mechanical locks.<ref name=\"Assuring Control\"/> It took until 1987 until these were completely replaced.\n\n=== Modernization and the present ===\nOver the years the Permissive Action Links have been continuously maintained and upgraded. In 2002, PALs on older [[B61 nuclear bomb]]s were replaced and upgraded with new systems to improve reliability and security, as a part of extending the weapons' service life to at least 2025.<ref>{{cite web\n|author = Grossman, Elaine M.\n|url =  http://www.nti.org/d_newswire/issues/2008_9_26.html#B8705677\n|title = U.S. Air Force Might Modify Nuclear Bomb\n|publisher =  GlobalSecurity.org\n|date = September 26, 2008}}</ref>\n\n'''Code Management System'''\n\nThe year 1995 saw the development of the Code Management System (CMS). The CMS has simplified the control and logistics for staff and improved the flexibility and speed in deploying and arming weapons. New codes can be used to recode, lock, and manage the weapons, while the secrecy and validity of the possible launch orders is still ensured. In total, CMS consists of fourteen custom products (nine software and five hardware products).<ref name=\"Weapons in Europe\">Hans M. Kristensen: ''U.S. Nuclear Weapons in Europe''.

([http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/euro/euro.pdf PDF; 4,9 MB], accessed February 4, 2009).</ref> The software products were developed by Sandia National Laboratories while the hardware was created by the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]].\n\nThe CMS was fully operational for the first time in November 2001. A part of the system, a special cryptographic processor fitted into the weapons in 1997 had a potential [[Year 2000 problem]]. By the spring of 2004, all PAL systems were equipped with the Code Management System. It is thus currently the general foundation for future hardware and software improvements to Permissive Action Links.\n\n== Features ==\nPermissive Action Links are powered by low-maintenance [[atomic battery|radioisotope generators]]. Instead of a conventional battery, these generators produce electricity based on the heat evolved from the radioactive decay of [[plutonium-238]].

Instead of another party confirming a missile launch as in the case of land-based [[ICBM]]s, the set of [[key (lock)|keys]] is distributed among the key personnel on the submarine and kept in safes (each of these crew members has access only to his keys), some of which are locked by [[combination lock]]s. Nobody on board has the combination to open these safes; the unlock key comes as a part of the launch order from the higher authority.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,101361-1,00.html Douglas C. Waller: Practicing For Doomsday]</ref>\n\nIn the case of [[Minuteman missile]] launch crews, both operators must agree that the launch order is valid by comparing the order's authorization code against a code from a ''Sealed Authenticator'' (a special sealed envelope that holds a code). The Sealed Authenticators are stored in a safe that has two separate [[Lock (security device)|locks]] so a single crew member cannot open the safe alone. Both crew members must simultaneously turn the four launch keys. An additional safeguard is provided by requiring the crew in another [[Launch control center (ICBM)|Launch Control Center]] to do the same for the missiles to be launched.\n\n=== Stronglinks and weaklinks ===\nAnother part of the PAL design is the inclusion of [[Strong link weak link|\"stronglinks\" and \"weaklinks.\"]] These words, which come from the proverb \"a chain is only as strong as its weakest link\", ensure resilience to accidental activation through damage. The stronglinks include the ruggedization of some components and inclusion of [[insensitive munitions]] so that they will not be circumvented by fire, vibration, or magnetic fields, leaving the PAL vulnerable to bypass after such damage. On the other hand, activation-critical electronics within the weapon, such as capacitors, are selected so that they will fail before the safety device in the event of damage, ensuring that the weapon [[failsafe|fails safe]].<ref>David W.

This is passed to the weapon by a unique signal generator located outside the weapon.

It determines through environmental sensors whether the weapon is operating under expected parameters. For example, on an ICBM, a nuclear warhead would first be exposed to a strong acceleration, and then a period of free fall. The ESD determines the external parameters such as acceleration curve, temperature and pressure and only activates the weapon when these external effects occur in the correct order and fall within specific parameters. So, should unauthorized personnel succeed in stealing a weapon, they could not activate it as long as a functional launch mechanism was not also stolen along with it. Of course, without the PAL codes they would still not succeed.\n\n=== Misfire ===\n[[File:Permissive Action Link Schematic Composite en.png|thumbnail|right|Simplified illustration of some nuclear weapon safety mechanisms]]\n\nThe conventional explosives needed to start the chain reaction are tailored to the characteristics of the fissile material in the core of the weapon. If the detonation does not occur exactly as planned, such as in the case of a  misfire, a nuclear reaction is unlikely to occur\u2014the explosion will be no greater than the amount of conventional explosive (although radioactive material\u2014the unreacted nuclear fuel\u2014may be dispersed). Computer simulations have assisted in calculating the likelihood of a chain reaction still occurring in a misfire. The odds of a nuclear chain reaction after a misfire of the conventional explosives is estimated to be one in one million.<ref>Sidney D. Drell: ''Addendum on Nuclear Warhead Safety.''

This precludes attempts to bypass the PAL codes through trial and error. The weapon must be returned to a maintenance facility in order to work again. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n=={{Anchor|Category}} Versions ==\n[[File:Nuclear missile launch keys.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Simulated [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|Peacekeeper]] missile launch]]\nOver the years the design and feature set of PALs has increased, as has the length of the access code.

Thus, since the 1960s, the US has offered its own PAL technologies to other nuclear powers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} The US considered this a necessary step: if the technology were kept secret, it would only be half as effective as possible, since the other power in a conflict might not have such safety measures.\n\nIn the early 1970s, France was an early recipient of United States assistance on this critical element of nuclear security. The [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) went into effect in 1970 and precluded treaty members (including the US) from directly disseminating technology related to nuclear weapons development or enhancement. In order to get around this prohibition, the US developed a legal trick: \"negative guidance\". French nuclear scientists would regularly brief US scientists on French developments in the field of PALs, and the US scientists would tell their French counterparts when they were not on the right track. In 1971, the US also offered its technology to the Soviet Union, which developed a similar system.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the [[People's Republic of China]] requested information to develop its own PALs.<ref>Steven M.

More recent innovations have included [[encrypted]] firing parameters, which must be decrypted to properly detonate the [[warhead]], plus [[anti-handling device|anti-tamper systems]] which intentionally mis-detonate the weapon, destroying it without giving rise to a nuclear explosion.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\n[[File:Sandia-Building800-1951.gif|thumbnail|right|[[Sandia National Laboratories]], 1951. Sandia was instrumental from the beginning in developing PALs.]]\n\nPermissive Action Links were developed in the [[United States]] over a gradual process from the [[Nuclear weapons testing|first use of atomic weapons]] to the early 1960s. Importantly, in 1953 the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] signed the ''Missiles and Rockets Agreement'', which paved the way for the development and implementation of PALs. Certain national laboratories, under the auspices of the AEC, would develop and produce nuclear weapons, while the responsibility for the use and deployment remained with the military. The laboratories were also free to conduct their own research in the field of arms control and security. The thinking behind this was that if the government would ever be interested in such a security device, the research and development of prototypes would already be well advanced. At the beginning of the 1960s, the desire for the usage of such a system grew for both political and technological reasons.\n\nNewer nuclear weapons were simpler in their operation and were produced en masse and were less cumbersome to arm and use than previous designs. Accordingly, new controls were necessary to prevent their unauthorized use. As the [[Cold War]] came to a head in the 1960s, the government felt it best not to leave the use of nuclear weapons in the hands of possibly-renegade generals, including the commander of [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC).<ref>Richard Rhodes: ''Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb''. Simon & Schuster, New York 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-684-81690-6}}.</ref> Without Permissive Action Links, nuclear weapons were effectively under the independent command of a number of generals.\n\n{{quote|I used to worry about the fact that <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Thomas S. Power|General Power]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> had control over so many weapons and weapon systems and could, under certain conditions, launch the force.

This was especially concerning to the [[United States Congress]], as this lack of control was in violation of federal law. Added to this was the fact that some of the allies were considered potentially unstable\u2014particularly [[West Germany]] and [[Turkey]].<ref name=\"Assuring Control\">Peter Stein, Peter Feaver: ''Assuring Control of Nuclear Weapons: The Evolution of Permissive Action Links''. University Press of America, Lanham 1989, {{ISBN|978-0-8191-6337-0}}.</ref> There was considerable concern that in one of these countries the instructions of the civilian leadership of the host country could overrule the military. In addition, the U.S. realized that in the event of war, parts of West Germany would be [[Fulda gap#In the Cold War|overwhelmed early on]], and nuclear weapons stationed there could fall into the hands of the Soviet Union.\n\nFor a long time the U.S. military resisted the use of PALs. It feared the loss of independence and feared malfunction, which could put warheads out of action in a time of crisis. But the advantages of PALs outweighed the disadvantages: thanks to the PALs weapons were able to be distributed to a greater extent in Europe, so as to prevent a rapid and selective destruction or conquest by the Soviet bloc, while still retaining U.S. control over the farther-flung weapons.<ref name=\"Assuring Control\" />\n\n=== Development and dissemination ===\nThe precursors of Permissive Action Links were simple mechanical [[combination lock]]s that were set into the control systems of nuclear weapons, such as the [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman]] [[ICBM]]. There they could perform different functions: some blocked the cavity through which the nuclear materials were [[Gun-type fission weapon|shot]] to create a reaction; other locks blocked circuits; and some simply prevented access to the control panel. For testing, some of these mechanisms were installed during 1959 in weapons stationed in Europe.<ref>''Weapon Dispersal without Fear of Unauthorized Use.'' In: ''Sandia Lab News'', Family Day Special Edition, Bd.&nbsp;38 Nr.&nbsp;20, 1986, S.&nbsp;4.</ref>\n\nThe work on PAL prototypes remained at low levels until 1960. [[Sandia National Laboratories]] (SNL) successfully created a number of new combination locks that were adaptable to different types of weapons. In the spring of 1961, there was a series of hearings in Congress, where Sandia presented the prototype of a special electro-mechanical lock, which was then known still as a \"Proscribed Action Link.\"  The military leadership, however, soon realized that this term had negative connotations for the use of weapons by the officer corps (proscribed = \"prohibited\"), and changed the meaning of PAL to \"Permissive Action Link\" (permissive = \"allowing / tolerating\").{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n[[File:NSAM 160.jpg|thumb|right| National Security Action Memorandum 160: introduction of PAL to all U.S. nuclear weapons under [[NATO]] command]]\n\nIn June 1962, President [[John F.

All other U.S. nuclear weapons were excluded at that time. The conversion was completed September 1962 and cost $23 million (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|23000000|1962|r=-6}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{Inflation-fn|US}}).\n\nAccording to nuclear safety expert [[Bruce G.

([http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/euro/euro.pdf PDF; 4,9 MB], accessed February 4, 2009).</ref> The software products were developed by Sandia National Laboratories while the hardware was created by the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]].\n\nThe CMS was fully operational for the first time in November 2001. A part of the system, a special cryptographic processor fitted into the weapons in 1997 had a potential [[Year 2000 problem]]. By the spring of 2004, all PAL systems were equipped with the Code Management System. It is thus currently the general foundation for future hardware and software improvements to Permissive Action Links.\n\n== Features ==\nPermissive Action Links are powered by low-maintenance [[atomic battery|radioisotope generators]]. Instead of a conventional battery, these generators produce electricity based on the heat evolved from the radioactive decay of [[plutonium-238]]. Although the half-life of <sup>238</sup>Pu is 87.7 years, these generators have shorter lifespans. This is due to the pressurization of the generator from helium produced by the [[alpha decay]] of the plutonium fuel.<ref>[http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/nmt/nmtdo/AQarchive/94-95winter/surveillance.html Milliwatt Surveillance Program Ensures RTG Safety and Reliability].

In general, elements of PAL systems are located deep within the nuclear device. This makes it almost impossible to bypass the system.\n\n{{quote|\"Bypassing a PAL should be, as one weapons designer graphically put it, about as complex as performing a [[tonsillectomy]] while entering the patient from the wrong end.\"|sign=Peter D.

Instead of another party confirming a missile launch as in the case of land-based [[ICBM]]s, the set of [[key (lock)|keys]] is distributed among the key personnel on the submarine and kept in safes (each of these crew members has access only to his keys), some of which are locked by [[combination lock]]s. Nobody on board has the combination to open these safes; the unlock key comes as a part of the launch order from the higher authority.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,101361-1,00.html Douglas C. Waller: Practicing For Doomsday]</ref>\n\nIn the case of [[Minuteman missile]] launch crews, both operators must agree that the launch order is valid by comparing the order's authorization code against a code from a ''Sealed Authenticator'' (a special sealed envelope that holds a code). The Sealed Authenticators are stored in a safe that has two separate [[Lock (security device)|locks]] so a single crew member cannot open the safe alone. Both crew members must simultaneously turn the four launch keys. An additional safeguard is provided by requiring the crew in another [[Launch control center (ICBM)|Launch Control Center]] to do the same for the missiles to be launched.\n\n=== Stronglinks and weaklinks ===\nAnother part of the PAL design is the inclusion of [[Strong link weak link|\"stronglinks\" and \"weaklinks.\"]] These words, which come from the proverb \"a chain is only as strong as its weakest link\", ensure resilience to accidental activation through damage. The stronglinks include the ruggedization of some components and inclusion of [[insensitive munitions]] so that they will not be circumvented by fire, vibration, or magnetic fields, leaving the PAL vulnerable to bypass after such damage. On the other hand, activation-critical electronics within the weapon, such as capacitors, are selected so that they will fail before the safety device in the event of damage, ensuring that the weapon [[failsafe|fails safe]].<ref>David W. Plummer, William H. Greenwood: ''History of Nuclear Weapon Safety Devices''. Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque 1998. Presented at the 34th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference, Cleveland, July 1998.

This is passed to the weapon by a unique signal generator located outside the weapon. This output is specific and well-defined, precluding approximation, emulation, noise, or interference from being accepted as a [[false positive]].<ref name=\"Peacetime Operations\">Donald R. Cotter: \"Peacetime Operations: Safety and Security.\" In: Ashton B. Carter, John D. Steinbruner, Charles A. Zraket (Eds.): ''Managing Nuclear Operations''. Brookings Institution Press, Washington, D.C. 1987, {{ISBN|978-0-8157-1313-5}}.</ref>\n\n=== Parameter recognition ===\nA further safeguard is the Environmental Sensing Device (ESD). It determines through environmental sensors whether the weapon is operating under expected parameters. For example, on an ICBM, a nuclear warhead would first be exposed to a strong acceleration, and then a period of free fall. The ESD determines the external parameters such as acceleration curve, temperature and pressure and only activates the weapon when these external effects occur in the correct order and fall within specific parameters. So, should unauthorized personnel succeed in stealing a weapon, they could not activate it as long as a functional launch mechanism was not also stolen along with it. Of course, without the PAL codes they would still not succeed.\n\n=== Misfire ===\n[[File:Permissive Action Link Schematic Composite en.png|thumbnail|right|Simplified illustration of some nuclear weapon safety mechanisms]]\n\nThe conventional explosives needed to start the chain reaction are tailored to the characteristics of the fissile material in the core of the weapon. If the detonation does not occur exactly as planned, such as in the case of a  misfire, a nuclear reaction is unlikely to occur\u2014the explosion will be no greater than the amount of conventional explosive (although radioactive material\u2014the unreacted nuclear fuel\u2014may be dispersed). Computer simulations have assisted in calculating the likelihood of a chain reaction still occurring in a misfire. The odds of a nuclear chain reaction after a misfire of the conventional explosives is estimated to be one in one million.<ref>Sidney D. Drell: ''Addendum on Nuclear Warhead Safety.'' In: ''In the Shadow of the Bomb: Physics and Arms Control.'' American Institute of Physics, New York 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-56396-058-1}}.</ref> The likelihood of a full-yield nuclear explosion is estimated to be even lower, at one in one billion.\n\n=== Limited attempts ===\nThe weapon renders itself inoperable if an activation code is entered incorrectly multiple times. This precludes attempts to bypass the PAL codes through trial and error. The weapon must be returned to a maintenance facility in order to work again. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n=={{Anchor|Category}} Versions ==\n[[File:Nuclear missile launch keys.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Simulated [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|Peacekeeper]] missile launch]]\nOver the years the design and feature set of PALs has increased, as has the length of the access code.

Thus, since the 1960s, the US has offered its own PAL technologies to other nuclear powers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} The US considered this a necessary step: if the technology were kept secret, it would only be half as effective as possible, since the other power in a conflict might not have such safety measures.\n\nIn the early 1970s, France was an early recipient of United States assistance on this critical element of nuclear security. The [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) went into effect in 1970 and precluded treaty members (including the US) from directly disseminating technology related to nuclear weapons development or enhancement. In order to get around this prohibition, the US developed a legal trick: \"negative guidance\". French nuclear scientists would regularly brief US scientists on French developments in the field of PALs, and the US scientists would tell their French counterparts when they were not on the right track. In 1971, the US also offered its technology to the Soviet Union, which developed a similar system.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the [[People's Republic of China]] requested information to develop its own PALs.<ref>Steven M.

The enclave currently occupies the area in and around [[Gerrard Street, London|Gerrard Street]]. It contains a number of Chinese restaurants, [[Chinese bakery|bakeries]], supermarkets, souvenir shops, and other Chinese-run businesses. The first Chinatown was located in [[Limehouse]] in the [[East End of London|East End]].\n\n==History==\nThe first area in London known as Chinatown was located in the [[Limehouse]] area of the [[East End of London]].<ref>Sales, Rosemary; d'Angelo, Alessio; Liang, Xiujing; Montagna, Nicola. \"London's Chinatown\" in Donald, Stephanie; Kohman, Eleonore; Kevin, Catherine. (eds) (2009). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wVJkryx7cJAC&pg=PA45 ''Branding Cities: Cosmopolitanism, Parochialism, and Social Change'']. [[Routledge]]. pp. 45\u201358.</ref> At the start of the 20th century, the Chinese population of London was concentrated in that area, setting up businesses which catered to the Chinese sailors who frequented in [[London Docklands|Docklands]]. The area was known through exaggerated reports and tales of [[slum housing]] and (the then-legal) [[opium]] dens, rather than the Chinese restaurants and supermarkets of the current Chinatown. However, much of the area was damaged by aerial bombing during [[the Blitz]] in the [[Second World War]], although a number of elderly Chinese still choose to live in this area. After the Second World War, however, the growing popularity of [[Chinese cuisine]] and an influx of immigrants from [[Hong Kong]] led to an increasing number of Chinese restaurants being opened elsewhere.\n\nThe present Chinatown, which is off [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] did not start to be established until the 1970s. Previously, it was a regular Soho area, run-down, with [[Gerrard Street, London|Gerrard Street]] the main thoroughfare. It was dominated by the Post Office, facing Macclesfield Street, and other major establishments were The Tailor & Cutter House, at 43/44, now a Chinese supermarket and restaurant, the Boulogne Restaurant, near the Wardour Street end, and by Peter Mario's Restaurant at the other end. Other businesses included a master baker's, the Sari Centre, Lesgrain French Coffee House, [[Harrison Marks]]' Glamour Studio, an Indian restaurant and various brothels. Probably the first Chinese restaurants opened in Lisle Street,<ref>In the 1950s, followed by SeeWoo, a Chinese supermarket, still serving the community today. Lisle Street was the Mecca of electronic junk, attracting hifi and television enthusiasts from all over southern England</ref> parallel to Gerrard Street, and more opened gradually; one of the first restaurants was Kowloon Restaurant. The Tailor & Cutter did not close down until around 1974. The area now has more than 80 restaurants.<ref>[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/food/restaurants/article2861.ece \"Giles Coren reviews Empress of Sichuan\"]. [[The Times]]. 20 February 2010.</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the property developer [[Rosewheel]] proposed a plan to redevelop the eastern part of Chinatown. The plan was opposed by many of the existing retailers in Chinatown, as they believe that the redevelopment would drive out the traditional Chinese retail stores from the area and change the ethnic characteristic of Chinatown. In October 2013 and July 2018, the London Chinatown Community Centre (LCCC) organised a one-day shutdown in [[protest]] of violent tactics by immigration officers from the [[Home Office]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/chinatown-protest-immigration-fishing-raids/|title=Chinatown in London is shutting down to protest \u2018violent fishing raids\u2019 by immigration officials|date=2018-07-24|work=i|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/22/chinatown-protest-immigration-border-agency-raids|title=Chinatown workers walk out in protest at immigration raids|last=Topping|first=Alexandra|date=2013-10-22|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-14}}</ref>. \n\nThe London Chinatown Community Centre (LCCC) has been housed in the Chinatown area since it was founded in 1980 by Dr Abraham Lue. The Centre claims to have received 40,000 people for help and assistance since its foundation. Located since 1998 on the second floor of 28-29 Gerrard Street, the Centre relocated to 2 Leicester Court in 2012, above the [[Hippodrome, London#The Hippodrome Casino|Hippodrome Casino]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.ccc.org.uk/about-us/our-history-%E6%AD%B7%E5%8F%B2/|work=London Chinatown Community Centre|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 July 2016, a new Chinatown gate on [[Wardour Street]] was opened by [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew, the Duke of York]].

The enclave currently occupies the area in and around [[Gerrard Street, London|Gerrard Street]]. It contains a number of Chinese restaurants, [[Chinese bakery|bakeries]], supermarkets, souvenir shops, and other Chinese-run businesses. The first Chinatown was located in [[Limehouse]] in the [[East End of London|East End]].\n\n==History==\nThe first area in London known as Chinatown was located in the [[Limehouse]] area of the [[East End of London]].<ref>Sales, Rosemary; d'Angelo, Alessio; Liang, Xiujing; Montagna, Nicola. \"London's Chinatown\" in Donald, Stephanie; Kohman, Eleonore; Kevin, Catherine. (eds) (2009). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wVJkryx7cJAC&pg=PA45 ''Branding Cities: Cosmopolitanism, Parochialism, and Social Change'']. [[Routledge]]. pp. 45\u201358.</ref> At the start of the 20th century, the Chinese population of London was concentrated in that area, setting up businesses which catered to the Chinese sailors who frequented in [[London Docklands|Docklands]]. The area was known through exaggerated reports and tales of [[slum housing]] and (the then-legal) [[opium]] dens, rather than the Chinese restaurants and supermarkets of the current Chinatown. However, much of the area was damaged by aerial bombing during [[the Blitz]] in the [[Second World War]], although a number of elderly Chinese still choose to live in this area. After the Second World War, however, the growing popularity of [[Chinese cuisine]] and an influx of immigrants from [[Hong Kong]] led to an increasing number of Chinese restaurants being opened elsewhere.\n\nThe present Chinatown, which is off [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] did not start to be established until the 1970s. Previously, it was a regular Soho area, run-down, with [[Gerrard Street, London|Gerrard Street]] the main thoroughfare. It was dominated by the Post Office, facing Macclesfield Street, and other major establishments were The Tailor & Cutter House, at 43/44, now a Chinese supermarket and restaurant, the Boulogne Restaurant, near the Wardour Street end, and by Peter Mario's Restaurant at the other end. Other businesses included a master baker's, the Sari Centre, Lesgrain French Coffee House, [[Harrison Marks]]' Glamour Studio, an Indian restaurant and various brothels. Probably the first Chinese restaurants opened in Lisle Street,<ref>In the 1950s, followed by SeeWoo, a Chinese supermarket, still serving the community today. Lisle Street was the Mecca of electronic junk, attracting hifi and television enthusiasts from all over southern England</ref> parallel to Gerrard Street, and more opened gradually; one of the first restaurants was Kowloon Restaurant. The Tailor & Cutter did not close down until around 1974. The area now has more than 80 restaurants.<ref>[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/food/restaurants/article2861.ece \"Giles Coren reviews Empress of Sichuan\"]. [[The Times]]. 20 February 2010.</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the property developer [[Rosewheel]] proposed a plan to redevelop the eastern part of Chinatown. The plan was opposed by many of the existing retailers in Chinatown, as they believe that the redevelopment would drive out the traditional Chinese retail stores from the area and change the ethnic characteristic of Chinatown. In October 2013 and July 2018, the London Chinatown Community Centre (LCCC) organised a one-day shutdown in [[protest]] of violent tactics by immigration officers from the [[Home Office]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/chinatown-protest-immigration-fishing-raids/|title=Chinatown in London is shutting down to protest \u2018violent fishing raids\u2019 by immigration officials|date=2018-07-24|work=i|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/22/chinatown-protest-immigration-border-agency-raids|title=Chinatown workers walk out in protest at immigration raids|last=Topping|first=Alexandra|date=2013-10-22|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-14}}</ref>. \n\nThe London Chinatown Community Centre (LCCC) has been housed in the Chinatown area since it was founded in 1980 by Dr Abraham Lue. The Centre claims to have received 40,000 people for help and assistance since its foundation. Located since 1998 on the second floor of 28-29 Gerrard Street, the Centre relocated to 2 Leicester Court in 2012, above the [[Hippodrome, London#The Hippodrome Casino|Hippodrome Casino]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.ccc.org.uk/about-us/our-history-%E6%AD%B7%E5%8F%B2/|work=London Chinatown Community Centre|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 July 2016, a new Chinatown gate on [[Wardour Street]] was opened by [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew, the Duke of York]].
