After Philip's assassination in 336&nbsp;BC, he succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army.

Following the conquest of [[Anatolia]], Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] and [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]]. He subsequently overthrew Persian King [[Darius III]] and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety.{{Cref2|b}} At that point, his empire stretched from the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the [[Beas River]].\n\nAlexander endeavoured to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea\" and [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|invaded India]] in 326 BC, winning an important victory over the [[Pauravas]] at the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]]. He eventually turned back at the demand of his homesick troops, dying in [[Babylon]] in 323 BC, the city that he planned to establish as his capital, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. In the years following [[Death of Alexander the Great|his death]], a [[Wars of the Diadochi|series of civil wars]] tore his empire apart, resulting in the establishment of several states ruled by the [[Diadochi]], Alexander's surviving generals and heirs.\n\nAlexander's legacy includes the [[cultural diffusion]] and [[syncretism]] which his conquests engendered, such as [[Greco-Buddhism]]. He founded some [[List of cities founded by Alexander the Great|twenty cities that bore his name]], most notably [[Alexandria]] in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]] in the east resulted in a new [[Hellenistic civilization]], aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the mid-15th century AD and the presence of [[Cappadocian Greeks|Greek speakers in central]] and [[Pontic Greeks|far eastern Anatolia]] until the [[Greek genocide]] of the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of [[Achilles]], and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures.

Sometime after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with a [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] engraved with a lion's image.<ref name=\"PA2\" /> Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was [[Zeus]]. Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming that she had told Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.<ref name=\"PA2\" />\n\nOn the day Alexander was born, Philip was preparing a [[siege]] on the city of [[Potidea]] on the peninsula of [[Chalcidice]]. That same day, Philip received news that his general [[Parmenion]] had defeated the combined [[Illyria]]n and [[Paeonian]] armies and that his horses had won at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. It was also said that on this day, the [[Temple of Artemis]] in [[Ephesus]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]], burnt down. This led [[Hegesias of Magnesia]] to say that it had burnt down because [[Artemis]] was away, attending the birth of Alexander.<ref>{{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=28}}, {{harvnb|Bose|2003|p=21}}</ref> Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly at his instigation, to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=188}}\n\nIn his early years, Alexander was raised by a nurse, [[Lanike]], sister of Alexander's future general [[Cleitus the Black]]. Later in his childhood, Alexander was tutored by the strict [[Leonidas of Epirus|Leonidas]], a relative of his mother, and by [[Lysimachus of Acarnania]].{{sfn|Renault|2001|pp=33\u201334}} Alexander was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths, learning to read, play the [[lyre]], ride, fight, and hunt.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=186}}\n\n[[File:\u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 2014 (The Statue of Alexander the Great) - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Alexander the Great in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Greece]]]]\nWhen Alexander was ten years old, a trader from [[Thessaly]] brought Philip a horse, which he offered to sell for thirteen [[Attic talent|talents]]. The horse refused to be mounted, and Philip ordered it away. Alexander, however, detecting the horse's fear of its own shadow, asked to tame the horse, which he eventually managed.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=188}} Plutarch stated that Philip, overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition, kissed his son tearfully, declaring: \"My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions. Macedon is too small for you\", and bought the horse for him.<ref name=\"PA6\" /> Alexander named it [[Bucephalas]], meaning \"ox-head\". Bucephalas carried Alexander as far as [[India]]. When the animal died (because of old age, according to Plutarch, at age thirty), Alexander named a city after him, [[Alexandria Bucephalous|Bucephala]].<ref>{{harvnb|Durant|1966|p=538}}, {{harvnb|Lane Fox|1980|p=64}}, {{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=39}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nWhen Alexander was 13, Philip began to search for a [[tutor]], and considered such academics as [[Isocrates]] and [[Speusippus]], the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] to take up the post. In the end, Philip chose [[Aristotle]] and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at [[Mieza, Macedonia|Mieza]] as a classroom. In return for teaching Alexander, Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle's hometown of [[Stageira]], which Philip had razed, and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex-citizens who were slaves, or pardoning those who were in exile.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane Fox|1980|pp=65\u201366}}, {{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=44}}, {{harvnb|McCarty|2004|p=15}}</ref>\n\nMieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles, such as [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], [[Hephaistion]], and [[Cassander]]. Many of these students would become his friends and future generals, and are often known as the 'Companions'. Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works of [[Homer]], and in particular the ''[[Iliad]]''; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane Fox|1980|pp=65\u201366}}, {{harvnb|Renault|2001|pp=45\u201347}}, {{harvnb|McCarty|2004|p=16}}</ref>\n\nDuring his youth, Alexander was also acquainted with Persian exiles at the Macedonian court, who received the protection of Philip II for several years as they opposed [[Artaxerxes III]].<ref name=\"NC\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=Timothy |last2=Brice |first2=Lee L. |title=Brill's Companion to Insurgency and Terrorism in the Ancient Mediterranean |date=2015 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-28473-9 |page=170 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=248DCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA170 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"EDC\">{{cite book |last1=Carney |first1=Elizabeth Donnelly |title=Women and Monarchy in Macedonia |date=2000 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=978-0-8061-3212-9 |page=101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbI2hZBy_EkC&pg=PA101 |language=en}}</ref> Among them were [[Artabazos II]] and his daughter [[Barsine]], future mistress of Alexander, who resided at the Macedonian court from 352 to 342 BC, as well as [[Amminapes]], future [[satrap]] of Alexander, or a Persian nobleman named [[Sisines]].<ref name=\"NC\">{{cite book |last1=Cawthorne |first1=Nigel |title=Alexander the Great |date=2004 |publisher=Haus Publishing |isbn=978-1-904341-56-7 |pages=42\u201343 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxyz0v9T74sC&pg=PA42 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"JM\">{{cite book |last1=Morgan |first1=Janett |title=Greek Perspectives on the Achaemenid Empire: Persia Through the Looking Glass |date=2016 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-4724-8 |pages=271\u201372 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49JVDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA271 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Briant |first1=Pierre |title=Alexander the Great and His Empire: A Short Introduction |date=2012 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-15445-9 |page=114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAW6kmL30RUC&pg=PA114 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"EJ\">{{cite book |last1=Jensen |first1=Erik |title=Barbarians in the Greek and Roman World |date=2018 |publisher=Hackett Publishing |isbn=978-1-62466-714-5 |page=92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QCRtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA92 |language=en}}</ref> This gave the Macedonian court a good knowledge of Persian issues, and may even have influenced some of the innovations in the management of the Macedonian state.<ref name=\"JM\"/>\n\n[[Suda]] writes that, also, [[Anaximenes of Lampsacus]] was one of his teachers.

Campaigning against the Greek city of [[Perinthus]], Alexander is reported to have saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city of [[Amphissa (city)|Amphissa]] began to work lands that were sacred to [[Apollo]] near [[Delphi]], a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. Still occupied in Thrace, he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander.{{sfn|Renault|2001|pp=47\u201349}}\n\nPhilip and his army joined his son in 338 BC, and they marched south through [[Thermopylae]], taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison.

During the ensuing [[Battle of Chaeronea (338&nbsp;BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]], Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian [[hoplites]] to follow, thus breaking their line.

This campaign, initially against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern [[Kandahar]] in Afghanistan, and [[Alexandria Eschate]] (\"The Furthest\") in modern [[Tajikistan]].

Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, [[Cleitus the Black]], during a violent drunken altercation at [[Maracanda]] (modern day [[Samarkand]] in [[Uzbekistan]]), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.{{sfn|Gergel|2004|p=99}}\n\nLater, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal [[page (servant)|pages]].

He invited the [[tribal chief|chieftains]] of the former satrapy of [[Gandhara]] (a region presently straddling eastern [[Afghanistan]] and northern [[Pakistan]]), to come to him and submit to his authority. [[Omphis]] (Indian name [[Ambhi]]), the ruler of [[Taxila]], whose kingdom extended from the [[Indus]] to the [[Jhelum River|Hydaspes (Jhelum)]], complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the [[Aspasioi]] and [[Assakenoi]] sections of the [[Kambojas]] (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit.{{sfn|Tripathi|1999|pp=118\u201321}} [[Ambhi]] hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1,000 talents in gold\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted [[Hephaestion]] and [[Perdiccas]] in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at [[Hund, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Hund]],<ref>Lane Fox 1973</ref> supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality.\n\nOn the subsequent advance of the [[Macedon]]ian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5,000 men and took part in the [[battle of the Hydaspes River]]. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of [[Porus]] (Indian name Puru), to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of [[Philip (son of Machatas)|Philip]], son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at [[Treaty of Triparadisus|Triparadisus]], 321 BC.\n\nIn the winter of 327/326&nbsp;BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against the Aspasioi of [[Kunar Valley|Kunar]] [[valley]]s, the Guraeans of the [[Panjkora|Guraeus]] valley, and the Assakenoi of the [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]] and [[Buner Valley|Buner]] valleys.<ref>{{harvnb|Narain|1965|pp=155\u201365}}</ref> A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost.

Alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings, so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line, about {{convert|3|km|2|abbr=on}}. By contrast, the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry. This ensured that Alexander would not be outflanked, while his phalanx, armed with long pikes, had a considerable advantage over the Persians' [[scimitars]] and [[javelins]]. Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians.{{sfn|Morkot|1996|p=122}}\n\nAt Issus in 333&nbsp;BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through.{{sfn|Morkot|1996|p=122}} Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=193}} At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes.

The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.{{sfn|Morkot|1996|p=122}}\n\nWhen faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques, such as in Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style.

He was born in [[Pella]] in 356 BC and succeeded his father [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] to the throne at the age of 20. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented [[military campaign]] through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty, he had created one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires]] of the ancient world, stretching from [[Greece]] to northwestern [[Historical India|India]].<ref>Bloom, Jonathan M.; Blair, Sheila S.

After Philip's assassination in 336&nbsp;BC, he succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army. Alexander was awarded the [[League of Corinth|generalship of Greece]] and used this authority to launch his father's pan-Hellenic project to lead the Greeks in the conquest of [[Persia]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Heckel|editor1-first=Waldemar|editor2-last=Tritle|editor2-first=Lawrence A.|title=Alexander the Great: A New History|date=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-3082-0|page=99|chapter=The Corinthian League}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Burger|first1=Michael|title=The Shaping of Western Civilization: From Antiquity to the Enlightenment|date=2008|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-55111-432-3|page=76}}</ref> In 334 BC, he invaded the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (Persian Empire) and began a [[Wars of Alexander the Great|series of campaigns]] that lasted 10 years. Following the conquest of [[Anatolia]], Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] and [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]]. He subsequently overthrew Persian King [[Darius III]] and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety.{{Cref2|b}} At that point, his empire stretched from the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the [[Beas River]].\n\nAlexander endeavoured to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea\" and [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|invaded India]] in 326 BC, winning an important victory over the [[Pauravas]] at the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]]. He eventually turned back at the demand of his homesick troops, dying in [[Babylon]] in 323 BC, the city that he planned to establish as his capital, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. In the years following [[Death of Alexander the Great|his death]], a [[Wars of the Diadochi|series of civil wars]] tore his empire apart, resulting in the establishment of several states ruled by the [[Diadochi]], Alexander's surviving generals and heirs.\n\nAlexander's legacy includes the [[cultural diffusion]] and [[syncretism]] which his conquests engendered, such as [[Greco-Buddhism]]. He founded some [[List of cities founded by Alexander the Great|twenty cities that bore his name]], most notably [[Alexandria]] in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]] in the east resulted in a new [[Hellenistic civilization]], aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the mid-15th century AD and the presence of [[Cappadocian Greeks|Greek speakers in central]] and [[Pontic Greeks|far eastern Anatolia]] until the [[Greek genocide]] of the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of [[Achilles]], and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. He was undefeated in battle and became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves.

Sometime after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with a [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] engraved with a lion's image.<ref name=\"PA2\" /> Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was [[Zeus]]. Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming that she had told Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.<ref name=\"PA2\" />\n\nOn the day Alexander was born, Philip was preparing a [[siege]] on the city of [[Potidea]] on the peninsula of [[Chalcidice]]. That same day, Philip received news that his general [[Parmenion]] had defeated the combined [[Illyria]]n and [[Paeonian]] armies and that his horses had won at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]].

This campaign, initially against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern [[Kandahar]] in Afghanistan, and [[Alexandria Eschate]] (\"The Furthest\") in modern [[Tajikistan]]. The campaign took Alexander through [[Media (region)|Media]], [[Parthia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]] (West Afghanistan), [[Drangiana]], [[Arachosia]] (South and Central Afghanistan), [[Bactria]] (North and Central Afghanistan), and [[Scythia]].{{Sfn |Arrian|1976|loc=III, 23\u201325, 27\u201330; IV, 1\u20137}}\n\nIn 329 BC, [[Spitamenes]], who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana, betrayed Bessus to [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], one of Alexander's trusted companions, and Bessus was executed.{{Sfn |Arrian|1976|loc= III, 30}} However, when, at some point later, Alexander was on the [[Syr Darya|Jaxartes]] dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army, Spitamenes raised Sogdiana in revolt.

Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, [[Cleitus the Black]], during a violent drunken altercation at [[Maracanda]] (modern day [[Samarkand]] in [[Uzbekistan]]), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.{{sfn|Gergel|2004|p=99}}\n\nLater, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal [[page (servant)|pages]].

Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted [[Hephaestion]] and [[Perdiccas]] in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at [[Hund, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Hund]],<ref>Lane Fox 1973</ref> supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality.\n\nOn the subsequent advance of the [[Macedon]]ian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5,000 men and took part in the [[battle of the Hydaspes River]]. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of [[Porus]] (Indian name Puru), to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of [[Philip (son of Machatas)|Philip]], son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at [[Treaty of Triparadisus|Triparadisus]], 321 BC.\n\nIn the winter of 327/326&nbsp;BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against the Aspasioi of [[Kunar Valley|Kunar]] [[valley]]s, the Guraeans of the [[Panjkora|Guraeus]] valley, and the Assakenoi of the [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]] and [[Buner Valley|Buner]] valleys.<ref>{{harvnb|Narain|1965|pp=155\u201365}}</ref> A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost.

Introduced to capture a share in the then-popular beat 'em ups market, it was meant to compete with [[Techn\u014ds Japan|Techn\u014ds]]' ''[[Double Dragon]]'', the leader of the genre at the time. Three years after its release in the arcades and on the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo AES]], it was released on [[Neo Geo CD]] as the only other home version.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/stream/GamePro_The_Cutting_Edge_Spring_1996#page/n109/mode/2up|title=Neo\u2022Geo CD: The Arcade In A Box - Burning Fight|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=Premiere Supplement|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=Spring 1996|page=104}}</ref>\n\nThe game is produced by Eikichi Kawasaki, one of SNK's founders and the man behind various well-known SNK titles, such as ''[[Fatal Fury]]'' and ''[[Samurai Shodown]]'' series.\n\nA re-released version of ''Burning Fight'' is included in ''[[SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1]]'', which was released for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[Wii]] in 2008.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:NEOGEO Burning Fight.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot showcasing the first boss.]]\n''Burning Fight'' follows a formula and concepts commonly seen in titles of this genre, such as [[Streets of Rage]], ''Double Dragon'' and ''[[Final Fight]]'': balanced character selection, objects and weapons found on the ground cause greater damage to opponents, and semi-interactive environments (players can damage objects like phone booths and [[street sign]]s along the way). The game is set in a fictional version of [[Osaka]] city (during a train station scene the platform even shows an \"[[Umeda Station|Umida]]\" station sign).\n\nThere are three playable characters, each with their own levels of strength, agility and special moves: Ryu is quick but weak, Billy is slow but very strong, and Duke is a more balanced hitter. One element that helps the game stand out from its competition is mini-stages, where the player must defeat some enemies in a short period of time in order to win prizes.\n\nAntagonists are members of Heiwa-Gumi, a Japanese [[yakuza]] gang, though there are a few Caucasian bosses and mid-level bosses (including three wrestling characters, Tom Anderson, Gary Powell and the Mad Dilly, modelled after [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Randy Savage]]), and the final boss is [[Italians|Italian]] mob boss '''Castella''' (''Casterora'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]). Moreover, the game has no individual endings, no matter which character has been chosen. After defeating Castella, players are presented with various scenes of the game along with the credits, and finally a group picture of the main characters.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n|title     = Contemporary reception\n|GR        = (Neo Geo) 55%<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamerankings.com/neo/582031-burning-fight/index.html|title=Burning Fight for NeoGeo|work=[[GameRankings]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=2019|accessdate=2019-07-21}}</ref>\n|Allgame   = (Neo Geo) {{Rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"AGNGbf\">{{cite web|last=Knight|first=Kyle|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=16994&tab=review|title=Burning Fight (Neo Geo Advanced Entertainment System) - Review|work=[[AllGame]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|date=1998|access-date=2019-07-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115224240/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=16994&tab=review|archive-date=2014-11-15|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|CVG       = (Neo Geo) 92 / 100<ref name=\"CVGNGbf\">{{cite magazine|last1=Rand|first1=Paul|last2=Boone|first2=Tim|url=https://archive.org/stream/computer-video-games-magazine-122/CVG122_Jan_1992#page/n33/mode/2up|title=Reviews - Neo Geo -- Burning Fight|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=122|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=January 1992|pages=34\u201335}}</ref>\n|GamePro   = (Neo Geo) 24 / 25<ref name=\"GProNGbf\">{{cite magazine|last=Quan|first=Slasher|url=https://archive.org/details/GamePro_Issue_030_January_1992/page/n103|title=Neo Geo For Real! - Burning Fight|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=30|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1992|pages=101\u2013102}}</ref>\n|rev1      = ''[[:fr:Consoles +|Consoles +]]''\n|rev1Score = (Neo Geo) 92%<ref name=\"C+NGbf\">{{cite magazine|author1=Loulou|author2=El Nio Nio|url=https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=51&num=8895&album=oui|title=Neo Geo Review - Burning Fight|magazine=[[:fr:Consoles +|Consoles +]]|issue=5|publisher=[[:fr:M.E.R.7|M.E.R.7]]|date=January 1992|pages=34\u201335|lang=fr}}</ref>\n|rev2      = ''[[Hobby Consolas|Hobby Hi-Tech]]''\n|rev2Score = (Neo Geo CD) 4 / 10<ref name=\"HHiTechNGCDbf\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/stream/HiTechMagazine/HiTech%2001#page/n28/mode/1up|title=Reportaje - Cl\u00e1sicos en CD -- Titulos disponibles para el nuevo formato de SNK: Burning Fight|magazine=[[Hobby Consolas|Hobby Hi-Tech]]|issue=1|publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]]|date=March 1995|page=29|lang=es}}</ref>\n|rev3      = ''[[:fr:Joypad (magazine)|Joypad]]''\n|rev3Score = (Neo Geo) 92%<ref name=\"JpadNGbf\">{{cite magazine|author1=Steph|last2=Demoly|first2=Jean-Marc|url=https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=84&num=1771&album=oui|title=Test - Neo Geo - Burning Fight|magazine=[[:fr:Joypad (magazine)|Joypad]]|issue=2|publisher=[[:fr:Yellow Media|Yellow Media]]|date=November 1991|pages=122\u2013124|lang=fr}}</ref>\n|rev4      = ''[[:fr:Joystick (magazine)|Joystick]]''\n|rev4Score = (Neo Geo) 92%<ref name=\"JNGbf\">{{cite magazine|last=Demoly|first=Jean-Marc|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Joystick/joystick_numero020/Joystick%20020%20-%20Page%20131%20(1991-10).jpg|title=Tests - Neo Geo - Burning Fight|magazine=[[:fr:Joystick (magazine)|Joystick]]|issue=20|publisher=[[:fr:Anuman Interactive|Anuman Interactive]]|date=October 1991|page=131|lang=fr|access-date=2019-07-21}}</ref>\n|rev5      = ''[[:de:Mega Fun|Mega Fun]]''\n|rev5Score = (Neo Geo) 77%<ref name=\"MFNGbf\">{{cite magazine|last1=Noak|first1=Philipp|last2=Hellert|first2=Stefan|url=http://www.kultboy.com/index.php?site=t&id=8807&s=3|title=Special - Neo Geo - Burning Fight|magazine=[[:de:Mega Fun|Mega Fun]]|issue=11|publisher=[[:de:Computec Media Group|CT Computec Verlag GmbH & Co.

Three years after its release in the arcades and on the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo AES]], it was released on [[Neo Geo CD]] as the only other home version.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/stream/GamePro_The_Cutting_Edge_Spring_1996#page/n109/mode/2up|title=Neo\u2022Geo CD: The Arcade In A Box - Burning Fight|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=Premiere Supplement|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=Spring 1996|page=104}}</ref>\n\nThe game is produced by Eikichi Kawasaki, one of SNK's founders and the man behind various well-known SNK titles, such as ''[[Fatal Fury]]'' and ''[[Samurai Shodown]]'' series.\n\nA re-released version of ''Burning Fight'' is included in ''[[SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1]]'', which was released for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[Wii]] in 2008.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:NEOGEO Burning Fight.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot showcasing the first boss.]]\n''Burning Fight'' follows a formula and concepts commonly seen in titles of this genre, such as [[Streets of Rage]], ''Double Dragon'' and ''[[Final Fight]]'': balanced character selection, objects and weapons found on the ground cause greater damage to opponents, and semi-interactive environments (players can damage objects like phone booths and [[street sign]]s along the way). The game is set in a fictional version of [[Osaka]] city (during a train station scene the platform even shows an \"[[Umeda Station|Umida]]\" station sign).\n\nThere are three playable characters, each with their own levels of strength, agility and special moves: Ryu is quick but weak, Billy is slow but very strong, and Duke is a more balanced hitter. One element that helps the game stand out from its competition is mini-stages, where the player must defeat some enemies in a short period of time in order to win prizes.\n\nAntagonists are members of Heiwa-Gumi, a Japanese [[yakuza]] gang, though there are a few Caucasian bosses and mid-level bosses (including three wrestling characters, Tom Anderson, Gary Powell and the Mad Dilly, modelled after [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Randy Savage]]), and the final boss is [[Italians|Italian]] mob boss '''Castella''' (''Casterora'' in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]). Moreover, the game has no individual endings, no matter which character has been chosen. After defeating Castella, players are presented with various scenes of the game along with the credits, and finally a group picture of the main characters.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n|title     = Contemporary reception\n|GR        = (Neo Geo) 55%<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamerankings.com/neo/582031-burning-fight/index.html|title=Burning Fight for NeoGeo|work=[[GameRankings]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=2019|accessdate=2019-07-21}}</ref>\n|Allgame   = (Neo Geo) {{Rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"AGNGbf\">{{cite web|last=Knight|first=Kyle|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=16994&tab=review|title=Burning Fight (Neo Geo Advanced Entertainment System) - Review|work=[[AllGame]]|publisher=[[All Media Network]]|date=1998|access-date=2019-07-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115224240/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=16994&tab=review|archive-date=2014-11-15|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|CVG       = (Neo Geo) 92 / 100<ref name=\"CVGNGbf\">{{cite magazine|last1=Rand|first1=Paul|last2=Boone|first2=Tim|url=https://archive.org/stream/computer-video-games-magazine-122/CVG122_Jan_1992#page/n33/mode/2up|title=Reviews - Neo Geo -- Burning Fight|magazine=[[Computer and Video Games]]|issue=122|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=January 1992|pages=34\u201335}}</ref>\n|GamePro   = (Neo Geo) 24 / 25<ref name=\"GProNGbf\">{{cite magazine|last=Quan|first=Slasher|url=https://archive.org/details/GamePro_Issue_030_January_1992/page/n103|title=Neo Geo For Real! - Burning Fight|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=30|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1992|pages=101\u2013102}}</ref>\n|rev1      = ''[[:fr:Consoles +|Consoles +]]''\n|rev1Score = (Neo Geo) 92%<ref name=\"C+NGbf\">{{cite magazine|author1=Loulou|author2=El Nio Nio|url=https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=51&num=8895&album=oui|title=Neo Geo Review - Burning Fight|magazine=[[:fr:Consoles +|Consoles +]]|issue=5|publisher=[[:fr:M.E.R.7|M.E.R.7]]|date=January 1992|pages=34\u201335|lang=fr}}</ref>\n|rev2      = ''[[Hobby Consolas|Hobby Hi-Tech]]''\n|rev2Score = (Neo Geo CD) 4 / 10<ref name=\"HHiTechNGCDbf\">{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://archive.org/stream/HiTechMagazine/HiTech%2001#page/n28/mode/1up|title=Reportaje - Cl\u00e1sicos en CD -- Titulos disponibles para el nuevo formato de SNK: Burning Fight|magazine=[[Hobby Consolas|Hobby Hi-Tech]]|issue=1|publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]]|date=March 1995|page=29|lang=es}}</ref>\n|rev3      = ''[[:fr:Joypad (magazine)|Joypad]]''\n|rev3Score = (Neo Geo) 92%<ref name=\"JpadNGbf\">{{cite magazine|author1=Steph|last2=Demoly|first2=Jean-Marc|url=https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=84&num=1771&album=oui|title=Test - Neo Geo - Burning Fight|magazine=[[:fr:Joypad (magazine)|Joypad]]|issue=2|publisher=[[:fr:Yellow Media|Yellow Media]]|date=November 1991|pages=122\u2013124|lang=fr}}</ref>\n|rev4      = ''[[:fr:Joystick (magazine)|Joystick]]''\n|rev4Score = (Neo Geo) 92%<ref name=\"JNGbf\">{{cite magazine|last=Demoly|first=Jean-Marc|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Joystick/joystick_numero020/Joystick%20020%20-%20Page%20131%20(1991-10).jpg|title=Tests - Neo Geo - Burning Fight|magazine=[[:fr:Joystick (magazine)|Joystick]]|issue=20|publisher=[[:fr:Anuman Interactive|Anuman Interactive]]|date=October 1991|page=131|lang=fr|access-date=2019-07-21}}</ref>\n|rev5      = ''[[:de:Mega Fun|Mega Fun]]''\n|rev5Score = (Neo Geo) 77%<ref name=\"MFNGbf\">{{cite magazine|last1=Noak|first1=Philipp|last2=Hellert|first2=Stefan|url=http://www.kultboy.com/index.php?site=t&id=8807&s=3|title=Special - Neo Geo - Burning Fight|magazine=[[:de:Mega Fun|Mega Fun]]|issue=11|publisher=[[:de:Computec Media Group|CT Computec Verlag GmbH & Co.

He was the first non congress chief minister of Assam. Borbora was a member of [[Rajya Sabha]] between 1968 and 1974.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born in [[Golaghat]] and had his early schooling in [[Tinsukia]] and then studied at the [[University of Calcutta]]. His parents were Komol Borbora (an executive officer from Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Digboi) and Puniyaprova Borbora. His father later left his job due to official issues (a long strike in the company). He had ten siblings, one of whom was [[Renu Saikia]], who later became famous as a prolific actress in the [[Assamese film industry]].<ref>http://www.nettv4u.com/celebrity/hindi/movie-actress/renu-saikia</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nBorbora was a follower of [[Ram Manohar Lohia]] and [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] and was imprisoned several times during the freedom movement.\n\nIn free India he was arrested in 1975 for opposing [[Indira Gandhi]]'s regime in the emergency in 1975 and spent 18 months in Tihar Jail. Golap Borbora became the State unit president of the [[Janata Party]] in 1977 and  led the party to victory. He was elected the first non-Congress Chief Minister of Assam in 1978.\n\nThe Janata Party Government led by Borbora lasted for 18 months only. However, many think that the government did not last long as he had tried to stop influx of illegal immigrants from neighboring countries and also to demonopolize the liquor trade in tea garden belts. His government exempted land revenue for farmers up to 10 bighas and ordered fee exemptions to school students up to HSLC level and all girls up to high school level.

He was the first non congress chief minister of Assam. Borbora was a member of [[Rajya Sabha]] between 1968 and 1974.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born in [[Golaghat]] and had his early schooling in [[Tinsukia]] and then studied at the [[University of Calcutta]]. His parents were Komol Borbora (an executive officer from Indian Oil Corporation Limited, Digboi) and Puniyaprova Borbora. His father later left his job due to official issues (a long strike in the company). He had ten siblings, one of whom was [[Renu Saikia]], who later became famous as a prolific actress in the [[Assamese film industry]].<ref>http://www.nettv4u.com/celebrity/hindi/movie-actress/renu-saikia</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nBorbora was a follower of [[Ram Manohar Lohia]] and [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] and was imprisoned several times during the freedom movement.\n\nIn free India he was arrested in 1975 for opposing [[Indira Gandhi]]'s regime in the emergency in 1975 and spent 18 months in Tihar Jail. Golap Borbora became the State unit president of the [[Janata Party]] in 1977 and  led the party to victory. He was elected the first non-Congress Chief Minister of Assam in 1978.\n\nThe Janata Party Government led by Borbora lasted for 18 months only. However, many think that the government did not last long as he had tried to stop influx of illegal immigrants from neighboring countries and also to demonopolize the liquor trade in tea garden belts. His government exempted land revenue for farmers up to 10 bighas and ordered fee exemptions to school students up to HSLC level and all girls up to high school level. The government also introduced free medical treatment in all the government hospitals and allowed free movement of foods-grains within the state.\n\nHe died in 2006.\n\n==Commemorative efforts==\n\nAs an attempt to commemorate the contributions of Borbora, College Students Welfare Committee, an N.G.O has instituted the C.S.W.C Golap Borbora Scholarship Programme that extends scholarship assistance to meritorious students.

About 40 salaried workers, 75 hourly workers and 90 contractors across Ford bases in Broadmeadows, Lara and Geelong will be affected, the company confirmed, as the automaker further consolidates its operations. Ford's engineering work on its Ranger ute and other models \"will be led out of the United States\", the company said in a statement. Remaining Australian-based engineers will have a \"strategic role\" in developing a new medium-sized pick-up truck for Ford and the German brand, the automaker said.<ref>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/more-than-100-ford-jobs-cut-in-victoria.</ref>\n\n== Models produced ==\nFord Australia started by assembling Model Ts. As Ford introduced new models, these were assembled in Australia. During World War II, Ford Australia ceased producing cars to commence military production to support the war effort.\n\nAfter World War II, Ford recommenced assembly of imported Ford models. Initially, they assembled the UK sourced [[Ford Pilot|Pilot]], then a range of British cars, including the [[Ford Prefect|Prefect]], [[Ford Anglia|Anglia]], [[Ford Consul|Consul]], [[Ford Zephyr|Zephyr]] and [[Ford Zodiac|Zodiac]]. Ford also assembled the Canadian Ford V8.\n\n=== Hatchback ===\nThe [[Ford Laser]] was produced in Ford's plant at [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]] in Sydney, from 1981 until September 1994 when the plant closed, after which they were fully imported from Japan. The Laser was replaced by the [[Ford Focus]] in 2002. It is currently offered in sedan and hatchback variants with a 2.0L engine, which is one of the market leaders in sales. The [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]], a global Ford product, has also been offered since 2004.\n\n=== Mid-size ===\nMid-size cars assembled in Australia included the [[Ford Cortina]], [[Ford Capri|Capri]] and [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Escort]], from the UK. These were adapted for the Australian market: for example, from 1972, the Cortina was available with the option of either a 3.3-litre or 4.1-litre six-cylinder engine, and the Escort could be offered across the range with the Cortina's 2.0-litre motor. In 1977, lack of capacity meant that the Cortina wagon was in fact assembled in [[Renault]]'s (now long since closed) Australian factory in [[Heidelberg, Victoria]].\n\nThe Cortina's replacement, the [[Mazda 626]]-based [[Ford Telstar|Telstar]], was initially assembled in Australia. In 1989 the Telstar sedan was replaced by the locally assembled [[Ford Corsair]] which was basically a rebadged [[Nissan Pintara]]. When Nissan shut down its Australian manufacturing operations in 1992 the Telstar nameplate was reintroduced, and as before it was a rebadged and respecced Mazda 626. In 1995 the Telstar was dropped in favour of the [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]], imported from [[Belgium]].\n\nFord Australia dropped the Mondeo in 2001, arguing at the time that the segment of the market in which it competed was in decline, but in 2007, it announced that it would introduce the new [[Ford Mondeo#Mk IV (2007)|Mk IV]] model in Australia.<ref>[http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/MiniSite/MiniSiteArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=36535&vf=28&MiniSiteID=4 Ford confirms Mondeo's return to Oz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111120434/http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/MiniSite/MiniSiteArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=36535&vf=28&MiniSiteID=4 |date=11 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\n=== Large car ===\n[[File:2015 Ford Falcon (FG X) G6E Turbo (2017-11-18) 01.jpg|thumb|[[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]] (1960\u20132016)]]\n\nThe Ford Falcon was manufactured in Australia according to its North American design, with the first model rolling off the production line at Ford's Broadmeadows plant on 28 June 1960. It differed little from the American design apart from conversion to [[right hand drive]], and the Falcon soon proved unable to cope on harsh Australian roads, sparking a massive effort to introduce running engineering changes to improve its reliability. By the mid-1960s, the car was substantially different from its North American cousin and was offered in sedan, wagon, coupe, utility and panel van styles.\n\nProduction of the North American Falcon, upon which the Falcon was now loosely based, ended in 1970, forcing Australia to go it alone on design. The first true all-Australian Ford Falcon arrived with the XA model in June 1972.\n\nThe Falcon had been an Australian automotive icon for most of its 56 years in production, playing a prominent part in Australian life, popular culture and motor racing. Falcons have served as taxis, police cars, family runabouts, transport for tradespeople and have been the winning car many times in the Australian Touring Car Championship and at the annual Bathurst 1000 touring car race, where the Falcon's reputation for engineering excellence was cemented by the early 1970s through the Falcon GT and GTHO muscle car variants.\n\nFord has manufactured more than four million units since 1960, and has topped the sales charts on many occasions. Until 2016, the Falcon line-up was offered in sedan and utility body styles, however in the past panel vans, station wagons, and hardtops were offered. Falcons had dominated the ranks of taxis in Australia and New Zealand, along with sister car, the Ford Fairlane. Performance variants of the Falcon have been used extensively for pursuit work for many years.\n\n=== Luxury car ===\nFord Australia produced a range of full-size luxury cars alongside the Falcon for most of its production history. These models were named the [[Ford Fairlane (Australia)|Fairlane]] and the LTD. The first Fairlane was released in 1959 and was an Australian assembled version of the [[1957 Ford|Fairlane]] from the USA. This process of assembling American cars would continue until 1967 where Ford Australia would design its own luxury car, the ZA Fairlane. The ZA Fairlane was heavily based on the existing XR Falcon with an extended wheelbase, longer boot and styling changes. The car was released to critical acclaim and quickly established the Australian luxury car market as its own.\n\nFord Fairlanes were preferred vehicles among politicians and businessmen and was seen as the pinnacle of Australian automotive engineering and prestige. The second generation of Fairlane, introduced in 1972 brought a new model into the Australian luxury car market, the LTD. The LTD in effect was a Fairlane with even more luxury features such as retractable headlights, a vinyl roof and an even longer wheelbase. From the third generation of Fairlane onwards, the LTD shared the same wheelbase and body as the Fairlane with it being pitched as a more luxurious version of the Fairlane rather than being a completely different car.\n\nThe Fairlane sat on top of the Australian luxury car sales charts for many decades before its gradual downfall starting in the late 1980s with the rising import of foreign luxury cars such as BMW and Mercedes Benz. By the turn of the millennium, the Fairlane had been overtaken by the [[Holden Caprice|Holden Statesman]] in sales. In 2007, Ford Australia announced it would be cancelling further production of the Fairlane and LTD beyond the 2007 model year, citing falling sales and an uncertain future in the full-size luxury market. With the backing of large volume foreign exports, this left the Holden Statesman and Caprice as the sole players in the full-size extended wheelbase Australian luxury car market until their demise in 2017.\n\n=== SUV ===\n[[File:2015 Ford Territory (SZ II) TX AWD wagon (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|Ford Territory (2004\u20132016)]]\n\nBetween 2004 and 2016, the [[Ford Territory (Australia)|Ford Territory]] had been built on the same production line as the Falcon.

It was founded in [[Geelong]], Victoria, in 1925 as an outpost of [[Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited]]. At that time, Ford Canada was a separate company from Ford USA. [[Henry Ford]] had granted the manufacturing rights of Ford motor vehicles in the British Empire (later the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]), except the United Kingdom, to Canadian investors.\n\nFord Australia's first products were Model Ts assembled from [[Complete knock down|complete knock-down (CKD) kits]] provided by Ford of Canada. It is best known in more recent times for having produced the [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]], originally a US model introduced in Australia in 1960, but adapted to Australian requirements and road conditions.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:TModel launch Geelong.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ford Model T]] parked outside the [[Geelong]] Library at its launch in Australia in 1925]]\n[[File:Ford geelong construction.jpg|thumb|right|The Ford Australia plant under construction in [[Geelong]], 1926.]]\n\nOn 31 March 1925, Ford announced that [[Geelong]], was to be the Australian headquarters. The first Australian-built Ford was a [[Ford Model T|Model T]] that came off an improvised production line in a disused Geelong wool storage warehouse in June 1925, while work started on a factory in the nearby suburb of Norlane.

However, they would lend money for the purchase of \"working\" vehicles. The coupe utility fulfilled the need of farmers to have a workhorse which could also be used \"to take the wife to church on Sunday and the pigs to the market on Monday\".\n\nIn 1956, the company bought a large tract of land in the northern [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Campbellfield, Victoria|Campbellfield]], and in July 1961 announced that the new Melbourne factory would become the company headquarters.<ref name=gex150 />\n\nFord Australia is one of Ford's five product development centres globally, and will continue to design and develop cars and trucks for the Asia/Pacific region after the closure of the manufacturing arm.

Around July 2009 Ford Australia had received permission from Detroit to add a new small car to its Falcon production line. On 23 May 2013, Ford Australia announced that it would stop making cars after 88 years due to uncompetitive manufacturing costs and lacklustre sales. The carmaker's annual financial report, for the previous year, showed a loss of A$141m dollars (\u00a390m/$136m) after tax for the 2012 financial year. This followed a loss of A$290m in 2011 and a total loss of A$600m over the preceding five years, as a result, 1,200 staff would lose their jobs.<ref>{{cite news|last=.co.uk|first=Guardian|title=Ford Australia to stop making cars|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/23/ford-australia-stop-making-cars|location=London|work=The Guardian|date=23 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nFord had two main factories, both in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]: located in the [[Geelong]] suburb of [[Norlane, Victoria|Norlane]] and the northern Melbourne suburb of Campbellfield.

It was negotiated during the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO at the beginning of 1995.<ref>Timothy J. Miano, [http://www.kentlaw.edu/jicl/articles/spring2006/s2006_Timothy_Miano.pdf \"Understanding and Applying International Infectious Disease Law: U.N. Regulations During an H5N1 Avian Flu Epidemic\"] 6 Chi-Kent J. Int'l & Comp. L. 26, 42-48 (2006).</ref> Broadly, the sanitary and phytosanitary ('SPS') measures covered by the agreement are those aimed at the protection of human, animal or plant life or health from certain risks.<ref>Peter Van den Bossche and Werner Zdouc, The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization: Text, Cases and Materials (Cambridge University Press, 2013) 834.</ref>\n\nUnder the SPS agreement, the WTO sets constraints on member-states' policies relating to food safety (bacterial contaminants, [[pesticides]], [[food inspection|inspection]] and [[food labelling|labelling]]) as well as [[animal health|animal]] and [[plant health]] (phytosanitation) with respect to imported pests and diseases. There are 3 standards organizations who set standards that WTO members should base their SPS methodologies on.  As provided for in Article 3, they are the [[Codex Alimentarius Commission]] (Codex), [[World Organization for Animal Health]] (OIE) and the Secretariat of the [[International Plant Protection Convention]] (IPPC).\n\nThe SPS agreement is closely linked to the [[Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade]], which was signed in the same year and has similar goals. The TBT Emerged from the Tokyo Round of WTO negotiations and was negotiated with the aim of ensuring non-discrimination in the adoption and implementation of technical regulations and standards.<ref>Kasturi Das, 'Coping with SPS Challenges in India: WTO and Beyond', (2008) 11(4) Journal of International Economic Law, 971-1019, 973-974, 973</ref>\n\n==History and framework==\nAs [[GATT]]'s preliminary focus had been lowering [[tariff]]s, the framework that preceded the SPS Agreement was not adequately equipped to deal with the problems of [[non-tariff barriers]] (NTBs) to trade and the need for an independent agreement addressing this became critical.<ref>Das, 'Coping with SPS Challenges in India: WTO and Beyond',973-974.</ref> The SPS Agreement is an ambitious attempt to deal with NTBs arising from cross-national differences in technical standards without diminishing governments prerogative to implement measures to guard against diseases and pests.<ref>Tim Buthe, 'The globalization of health and safety standards: delegation of regulatory authority in the SPS Agreement of the 1994 agreement establishing the World Trade Organization' (2008) 71(1) Law and Contemporary Problems, 219-255</ref>\n\n==Main provisions==\n* Article 1 \u2013 General Provisions - Outlines the application of the Agreement.\n* Annex A.1 \u2013 Definition of SPS measures.\n* Article 2 \u2013 Basic Rights and Obligations. Article 2.2 - requires measures to be based on sufficient scientific analysis. Article 2.3 - states that Members shall ensure that their sanitary and phytosanitary measures do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between Members where identical or similar conditions prevail, including between their own territory and that of other Members.  Sanitary and phytosanitary measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute a disguised restriction on international trade.\n* Article 3 \u2013 Harmonization. Article 3.1- To harmonize sanitary and phytosanitary measures on as wide a basis as possible, Members shall base their sanitary or phytosanitary measures on international standards, guidelines or recommendations, where they exist, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, and in particular in paragraph 3.

In 1996, the United States and Canada challenged before the [[WTO Dispute Settlement Body]] (DSB) a number of [[European Union|EU]] [[Directive (European Union)|directive]]s prohibiting the importation and sale of meat and meat products treated with certain [[growth hormone]]s. The complainants alleged that the EU directives violated, among other things, several provisions of the SPS Agreement. The EU contended that the presence of the banned hormones in food may present a risk to consumers' health and that, as a consequence, the directives were justified under several WTO provisions authorizing the adoption of trade-restrictive measures that are necessary to protect human health. In 1997 and 1998, the WTO adjudicating bodies admitted USA and Canada claims and invited the EU to bring the directives into conformity with WTO law before end of May 1999. EU did not comply and the DSB authorized the USA and Canada to take countermeasures against the EU. The countermeasures took the form of increased custom duties applied by the USA and Canada on certain EU products, including the notorious [[Roquefort]] cheese. In 2004, while the ban on hormone-treated meat was still in place, the EU initiated before the DSB new proceedings seeking the lifting of the countermeasures applied by the USA and Canada. EU alleged that it had collected new scientific data evidencing that the banned hormones may cause harm to consumers. According to the EU, the new scientific data provides sufficient ground for the ban on hormones, which may no more be sanctioned by the countermeasures imposed by the USA and Canada. As of January 2007, the proceedings initiated by the EU were still pending.\n\n==Interaction with other World Trade Organization instruments==\nWhile Article 1.5 of the TBT precludes the inclusion of SPS measures from its ambit, in EC-Biotech, the panel recognised that situations could arise where a measure is only partly an SPS measure, and in those cases, the SPS part of the measure will be considered under the SPS Agreement.<ref>Simon Baughen, International Trade and the Protection of the Environment (Routledge-Cavendish, 2007) 53.</ref> If a measure conforms with SPS, under Article 2.4 of the SPS Agreement, it is assumed that the measure falls within the scope of GATT, Article XX(b).\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Economic considerations===\nTrade in the products subject to SPS-type measures have the potential to result in significant economic gains for national economies.<ref>Matthew Arthur, 'An Economic Analysis of Quarantine: The Economics of Australia's Ban on New Zealand Apple Imports' (Paper presented at the New Zealand Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Conference, Nelson, August 24\u201325, 2006) 2</ref> Favouring economic concerns over other important public health policy issues, however, is something that requires close scrutiny by governments and the international community.<ref>Markus Wagner, 'Law Talk v.

Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures''', also known as the '''SPS Agreement''', is an international [[treaty]] of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). It was negotiated during the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), and entered into force with the establishment of the WTO at the beginning of 1995.<ref>Timothy J. Miano, [http://www.kentlaw.edu/jicl/articles/spring2006/s2006_Timothy_Miano.pdf \"Understanding and Applying International Infectious Disease Law: U.N. Regulations During an H5N1 Avian Flu Epidemic\"] 6 Chi-Kent J. Int'l & Comp. L. 26, 42-48 (2006).</ref> Broadly, the sanitary and phytosanitary ('SPS') measures covered by the agreement are those aimed at the protection of human, animal or plant life or health from certain risks.<ref>Peter Van den Bossche and Werner Zdouc, The Law and Policy of the World Trade Organization: Text, Cases and Materials (Cambridge University Press, 2013) 834.</ref>\n\nUnder the SPS agreement, the WTO sets constraints on member-states' policies relating to food safety (bacterial contaminants, [[pesticides]], [[food inspection|inspection]] and [[food labelling|labelling]]) as well as [[animal health|animal]] and [[plant health]] (phytosanitation) with respect to imported pests and diseases. There are 3 standards organizations who set standards that WTO members should base their SPS methodologies on.  As provided for in Article 3, they are the [[Codex Alimentarius Commission]] (Codex), [[World Organization for Animal Health]] (OIE) and the Secretariat of the [[International Plant Protection Convention]] (IPPC).\n\nThe SPS agreement is closely linked to the [[Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade]], which was signed in the same year and has similar goals. The TBT Emerged from the Tokyo Round of WTO negotiations and was negotiated with the aim of ensuring non-discrimination in the adoption and implementation of technical regulations and standards.<ref>Kasturi Das, 'Coping with SPS Challenges in India: WTO and Beyond', (2008) 11(4) Journal of International Economic Law, 971-1019, 973-974, 973</ref>\n\n==History and framework==\nAs [[GATT]]'s preliminary focus had been lowering [[tariff]]s, the framework that preceded the SPS Agreement was not adequately equipped to deal with the problems of [[non-tariff barriers]] (NTBs) to trade and the need for an independent agreement addressing this became critical.<ref>Das, 'Coping with SPS Challenges in India: WTO and Beyond',973-974.</ref> The SPS Agreement is an ambitious attempt to deal with NTBs arising from cross-national differences in technical standards without diminishing governments prerogative to implement measures to guard against diseases and pests.<ref>Tim Buthe, 'The globalization of health and safety standards: delegation of regulatory authority in the SPS Agreement of the 1994 agreement establishing the World Trade Organization' (2008) 71(1) Law and Contemporary Problems, 219-255</ref>\n\n==Main provisions==\n* Article 1 \u2013 General Provisions - Outlines the application of the Agreement.\n* Annex A.1 \u2013 Definition of SPS measures.\n* Article 2 \u2013 Basic Rights and Obligations. Article 2.2 - requires measures to be based on sufficient scientific analysis. Article 2.3 - states that Members shall ensure that their sanitary and phytosanitary measures do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between Members where identical or similar conditions prevail, including between their own territory and that of other Members.  Sanitary and phytosanitary measures shall not be applied in a manner which would constitute a disguised restriction on international trade.\n* Article 3 \u2013 Harmonization. Article 3.1- To harmonize sanitary and phytosanitary measures on as wide a basis as possible, Members shall base their sanitary or phytosanitary measures on international standards, guidelines or recommendations, where they exist, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, and in particular in paragraph 3. Article 3.3 \u2013 allows Members to implement SPS measures higher than if they were basing them on international standards where there is a scientific justification or the Member determines the measure to be appropriate in accordance with 5.1-5.8. \n* Annex A.3 \u2013 outlines the standard-setting bodies.\n* Article 5 \u2013 Risk Assessment and Determination of the Appropriate Level of SPS Protection. Article 5.1 - Members shall ensure that their sanitary or phytosanitary measures are based on an assessment, as appropriate to the circumstances, of the risks to human, animal or plant life or health, taking into account risk assessment techniques developed by the relevant international organizations.\n* Annex A.4 \u2013 outlines risk assessment process.\n* Article 5.5 - each Member shall avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions in the levels it considers to be appropriate in different situations, if such distinctions result in discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade.

Much of the border follows the [[Southern Railway (Turkey)|Southern Turkish]] stretch of the [[Baghdad Railway]], roughly along the [[37th parallel north|37th parallel]] between the 37th and 42nd eastern meridians. In the west, it almost surrounds the Turkish [[Hatay Province]], partly following the course of the [[Orontes River]] and reaching the Mediterranean coast at the foot of [[Jebel Aqra]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Mount Dyunag and Karadouran beach, Kessab, Syria.jpg|thumb|Karadouran/al-Samara beach near [[Kessab]], Syria, along the Syrian-Turkish borderline, where Mount Dyunag touches the [[Mediterranean Sea]]]]\nDue to Turkey's annexation of Hatay Province, the post-1939 Syrian\u2013Turkish border touches the [[Mediterranean]] coast at [[Ras al-Bassit]], south of [[Mount Aqra]] ({{coord|35.9288|N|35.9178|E|}}). The Hatay province borders the Syrian [[Latakia Governorate|Latakia]] and [[Idlib Governorate|Idlib]] governorates. The westernmost (and southernmost) border crossing is at {{coord|35.905|N|36.010|E|}}, some 3&nbsp;km west of [[Yaylada\u011f\u0131]]. The border reaches its [[Extreme points of Turkey|southernmost point]] at {{coord|35.808|N|36.152|E|}}, 2&nbsp;km west of [[Bidama]], to include the now-abandoned village of Topraktutan (Beysun)  in Hatay.<ref>\nThe village's population was 583 in 1980 ([https://books.google.ch/books?id=LjtpAAAAMAAJ&q=Topraktutan+%28Beysun%29&dq=Topraktutan+%28Beysun%29&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjbucql_63JAhUG_w4KHWWGBPkQ6AEINjAD T\u00fcrk D\u00fcnyas\u0131 Ara\u015ft\u0131rmalar\u0131 Vakf\u0131], 1986, p. 142); it was later evacuated due to landslides. There is now a police station and a monument marking the southernmost point of Turkey. Topraktutan forms a small salient into Syrian territory. It corresponds to the Turkish airspace claimed to have been violated prior to the [[2015 Russian Sukhoi Su-24 shootdown]].</ref>\n\nThe border now runs north and east, following the [[Orontes River]] for a part of its course, where in 2011 construction of a [[Syria\u2013Turkey Friendship Dam]] began (but has since been delayed due to the Syrian Civil War),<ref>{{cite news|title=Construction interrupted for friendship dam along Turkey-Syria border|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=248885|accessdate=29 April 2012|newspaper=Today's Zaman|date=29 June 2011}}</ref> and east to the [[Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing]] on the [[\u0130skenderun]]\u2013[[Aleppo]] road, then further north to the border between Hatay and [[Gaziantep Province]], where it turns sharply east outside of [[Meidan Ekbis]] ([[Afrin District]]), at {{coord|36.830|N|36.665|E}}.\n\nWith the exception of Hatay province, the Turkish side of the border is entirely within the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region]]. East of Meidan Ekbis, the border stretches eastward for some 400&nbsp;km, roughly following the [[37th parallel north]] and passing the [[37th meridian east|37th]] to [[42nd meridian east|42nd]] meridians. For a significant distance, from [[\u00c7obanbey]] to [[Nusaybin]] the border follows the tracks of the [[Konya-Baghdad Railway]]. It crosses the [[Euphrates River]] at [[Jarabulus]]/[[Karkam\u0131\u015f]] and passes north of the border town of [[Koban\u00ee|Koban\u00ee (Ayn al Arab)]] (built in 1912 as part of the Baghdad Railway construction project). The [[Raqqa Governorate]]'s [[Tell Abyad District]] borders the Turkish [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Province]], including the divided border town of [[Tell Abyad]]/[[Ak\u00e7akale]]. The [[Al-Hasakah Governorate]], still bordering  [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Province]], has a border crossing at [[Ras al-Ayn, al-Hasakah Governorate|Ras al-Ayn]], connecting to [[Ceylanp\u0131nar]]. Some 100&nbsp;km east of Ceylanp\u0131nar, the border passes the border town of [[Nusaybin]] in the Turkish [[Mardin Province]] (ancient ''Nisibis'', the birthplace of [[Ephraim the Syrian]]), next to Syrian [[Qamishli]]. The Syrian [[Aleppo Governorate]] has a {{convert|221|km}} long northern boundary with the Turkish [[Kilis Province|Kilis]], [[Gaziantep Province|Gaziantep]], and [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Province|\u015eanl\u0131urfa]] provinces.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn the Turkish side, the [[European route E90]] runs alongside the length of the border, crossing the Euphrates at [[Birecik]] and the Tigris at [[Cizre]]. For the final 30&nbsp;km the border follows the course of the Tigris, turning towards the south-east, until it reaches the Iraq-Syria-Turkey [[tripoint]] at {{coord|37.106|N|42.355|E}}.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Treaty of S\u00e8vres 1920.svg|thumb|right|Turkey's borders as determined by the 1920 Treaty of S\u00e8vres.]]\nAt the start of the 20th century the entire border region was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The Hatay province borders the Syrian [[Latakia Governorate|Latakia]] and [[Idlib Governorate|Idlib]] governorates. The westernmost (and southernmost) border crossing is at {{coord|35.905|N|36.010|E|}}, some 3&nbsp;km west of [[Yaylada\u011f\u0131]]. The border reaches its [[Extreme points of Turkey|southernmost point]] at {{coord|35.808|N|36.152|E|}}, 2&nbsp;km west of [[Bidama]], to include the now-abandoned village of Topraktutan (Beysun)  in Hatay.<ref>\nThe village's population was 583 in 1980 ([https://books.google.ch/books?id=LjtpAAAAMAAJ&q=Topraktutan+%28Beysun%29&dq=Topraktutan+%28Beysun%29&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjbucql_63JAhUG_w4KHWWGBPkQ6AEINjAD T\u00fcrk D\u00fcnyas\u0131 Ara\u015ft\u0131rmalar\u0131 Vakf\u0131], 1986, p. 142); it was later evacuated due to landslides.

East of Meidan Ekbis, the border stretches eastward for some 400&nbsp;km, roughly following the [[37th parallel north]] and passing the [[37th meridian east|37th]] to [[42nd meridian east|42nd]] meridians. For a significant distance, from [[\u00c7obanbey]] to [[Nusaybin]] the border follows the tracks of the [[Konya-Baghdad Railway]]. It crosses the [[Euphrates River]] at [[Jarabulus]]/[[Karkam\u0131\u015f]] and passes north of the border town of [[Koban\u00ee|Koban\u00ee (Ayn al Arab)]] (built in 1912 as part of the Baghdad Railway construction project). The [[Raqqa Governorate]]'s [[Tell Abyad District]] borders the Turkish [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Province]], including the divided border town of [[Tell Abyad]]/[[Ak\u00e7akale]]. The [[Al-Hasakah Governorate]], still bordering  [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Province]], has a border crossing at [[Ras al-Ayn, al-Hasakah Governorate|Ras al-Ayn]], connecting to [[Ceylanp\u0131nar]]. Some 100&nbsp;km east of Ceylanp\u0131nar, the border passes the border town of [[Nusaybin]] in the Turkish [[Mardin Province]] (ancient ''Nisibis'', the birthplace of [[Ephraim the Syrian]]), next to Syrian [[Qamishli]]. The Syrian [[Aleppo Governorate]] has a {{convert|221|km}} long northern boundary with the Turkish [[Kilis Province|Kilis]], [[Gaziantep Province|Gaziantep]], and [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa Province|\u015eanl\u0131urfa]] provinces.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn the Turkish side, the [[European route E90]] runs alongside the length of the border, crossing the Euphrates at [[Birecik]] and the Tigris at [[Cizre]]. For the final 30&nbsp;km the border follows the course of the Tigris, turning towards the south-east, until it reaches the Iraq-Syria-Turkey [[tripoint]] at {{coord|37.106|N|42.355|E}}.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Treaty of S\u00e8vres 1920.svg|thumb|right|Turkey's borders as determined by the 1920 Treaty of S\u00e8vres.]]\nAt the start of the 20th century the entire border region was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Breeds vary widely in appearance and purpose, ranging from  show breeds with long, flowing hair to those in use as [[model organisms]] by science. From ca. 1200 AD to the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]] in 1532, selective breeding by [[Indigenous peoples in South America|indigenous South American people]] resulted in many [[landrace]] varieties of domestic guinea pigs, which form the basis for some of the modern, formal breeds.<ref name=walker>{{cite book | last = Nowak | first = Ronald M. | title = Walker's Mammals of the World | url = https://archive.org/details/walkersmammalsof0002nowa | url-access = registration | edition = 6th | year = 1999 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/walkersmammalsof0002nowa/page/1667 1667\u20131669] | isbn = 0-8018-5789-9}}</ref>  Early Andean varieties were primarily kept as agricultural stock for food, and efforts at improving the guinea pig as a food source continue to the modern era.\n\nWith the export of guinea pigs to Europe in the 15th century, the goal in breeding shifted to focus on the development of appealing pets. To this end, various [[Animal fancy|competitive breeding]] organizations were founded by fanciers. The [[American Cavy Breeders Association]], an adjunct to the [[American Rabbit Breeders Association]], is the governing body in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution |url=http://www.acbaonline.com/constitution.html |publisher=American Cavy Breeders Association |date=2006-09-29 |accessdate=2007-03-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405184705/http://www.acbaonline.com/constitution.html |archivedate=2007-04-05 }}</ref> The [[British Cavy Council]] governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom.

New breeds continue to emerge in the 21st century.\n\nThough there are many breeds of guinea pig, only a few breeds are commonly found on the show table as pets. Most guinea pigs found as pets were either found undesirable{{clarify|undesirable for showing or as pets?|date=March 2013}} by breeders or were bred to be pleasant pets regardless of how well they meet the breed standard of perfection. The English/American Short-haired, the Abyssinian (rough-coated), the Peruvian (long-coated), and the Sheltie (also known as Silkie, long-coated) breeds are those most frequently seen as pets, and the former three are the core breeds in the history of the competitive showing of guinea pigs. In addition to their standard form, nearly all breeds come in a Satin variant. Satins, due to their hollow hair shafts, possess coats of a special gloss and shine. However, there is growing evidence that the genes responsible for the satin coat also can cause severe bone problems, including [[osteodystrophy]] and [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]].<ref>Jordan, Julia.

Dissertation, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, 2006.  {{ISBN|978-3-86664-349-9}}</ref> Showing satin variations is prohibited by some cavy breeders' associations because of animal welfare reasons.\n\nAll cavy breeds have some shared general standards: the head profile should be rounded, with large eyes and large, smooth ears. The body should be strong and of compact build. Coat colour should in all variations be clearly defined and thorough from root to tip. These standards are best met by long established, commonly bred breeds, as their breeders have had enough time and animals to effectively breed for these qualities. The coat colour ideal of good definition and thoroughness is rarely met by other than the smooth-coated breeds, which have had well established, separate breeding lines for different colours.\n\n== American ==\n[[File:Guinea pig Lucas.JPG|thumb|An American [[guinea pig]].]]\nThe most common guinea pig breed, the American guinea pig, is a recognized breed by [[American Rabbit Breeders Association]] (ARBA). They are entered and shown in ARBA competitions in nineteen color classifications; [[Black]], [[Cream (colour)|Cream]], Red, White, Any Other Self (Beige, Chocolate, Lilac, Red-Eyed Orange), Brindle, Roan, Dilute Solid, Golden Solid, Silver Solid, Dilute Agouti, Golden Agouti, Silver Agouti, Dalmatian, Dutch, Himalayan, Tortoise Shell & White, Any Other Marked (Broken Color and Tortoise Shell), and Tan Pattern (Black Tan, Blue Tan, Chocolate Tan, Beige Tan, and Lilac Tan). The American guinea pig is to be posed with the hind feet under the animal and the front feet slightly ahead of the shoulders, and should not be forced into a cobby position or stretched out.\n\nThe American should have a broad shoulder, Roman nose, and full crown, and the coat is to be short and silky. The coat is faulted for feathering, harshness, or being thin or long. Contestants are disqualified for ridges, rosettes, side whiskers, or a Satin sheen, though this should not be confused with the natural luster of some varieties. The ears are to be drooping but not fallen, and the eyes are to be bold and bright.\n\nThe American is known for its sweet and docile personality, and is considered by many an excellent breed of cavy for new owners.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=08gvj-g6k1oC&pg=PA22&dq=American+guinea+pig&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiizcvvkJ7KAhVDzz4KHXAmBw8Q6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&q=American%2520guinea%2520pig&f=false|title=The Complete Guinea Pig Care Guide|last=Products|first=Cash Flow|publisher=CashFlowProducts.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== White Crested ==\n\nThe White Crested is similar to the American, but they have one white rosette on the forehead. The breed standards and ideals are nearly identical, with the exception that a White Crested cavy's crest should be completely of a color different from the rest of the animal.

The rosettes are worth 25 points by ARBA standard. The hair is coarse and harsh, shaped in precise rosettes over the body. There are 10 rosettes on a show cavy; four saddle, two shoulder, two hip, and two rump rosettes. Some judging bodies, such as the ANCC, consider shoulder rosettes optional but desired in show Abyssinians. The rosettes are to be round with pinpoint centers, and are to be faulted for guttering (elongated rosettes), double rosettes, and uneven placement.

Other hair disqualifications include a coat over 1.5 inches in length and a satin sheen (not to be confused by the natural luster of some varieties). Required head furnishings (5 points by ARBA standard) include a well formed mustache and an erect mane running down the head.\n\nAbyssinians are deemed by many as good pets for experienced owners of exotic animals but their excitable nature makes them not necessarily a good choice for first time cavy owners.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guineapighub.com/abyssinian-guinea-pig.html|title=The Abyssinian Guinea Pig Guide|website=www.guineapighub.com|access-date=2016-05-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507145816/http://www.guineapighub.com/abyssinian-guinea-pig.html|archive-date=2016-05-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Teddy ==\n\n[[Image:Teddy guinea pig.jpg|right|thumb|Teddy Guinea Pig]]\nA Teddy has a short, rough, very dense and springy coat that stands up all over the body. The hair typically grows to a moderate length and generally makes this breed resemble a soft toy more than any other.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guineapighub.com/teddy-guinea-pig.html|title=Teddy Guinea Pig - A Quick Guide|website=www.guineapighub.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}</ref> Another unique feature of the Teddies in the USA is the relatively long hair coating their bellies. The Teddy has a kinky, springy coat that is famous for its soft, cuddly quality, often compared to an old teddy bear. They come in Plush Coat and Harsh Coat, the plush coated animals having a softer coat, and the harsh coated with a coarser texture to the hair.\n\n== Hairless ==\nFew varieties of hairless Guinea pig exist, the most prevalent breeds being the [[Skinny pig]] and the Baldwin. They are two separate breeds, with different genetic factors rendering them hairless. Hairless cavies in general need warmer accommodation and more energy-rich food to compensate for the loss of body heat. They are also susceptible to draught, drying of the skin, and skin infections without careful husbandry.\n\n=== Skinny ===\n[[File:Skinny Pig.jpg|right|thumb|Skinny Pig]]\n{{Main|Skinny pig}}\nThe Skinny is a mostly hairless breed, with some short rough hair on the face and the feet. Pups are born nearly hairless.\n\nThe breed was developed from a hairless laboratory strain crossed with Teddies and other haired breeds.\n\n=== Baldwin ===\n{{Main|Baldwin guinea pig}}\nThe Baldwin is a nearly hairless breed. Baldwins are born with a full coat, which sheds out with age until only a little hair remains on the feet.\n\nThe breed was developed from spontaneously mutated pups born to American Crested parents of a single breeder.\n\n== Colourations ==\nCavies of various breeds have several colourations and patterns. For short-coated cavies, most colours constitute breed variations bred and shown separately from other colours. All colourations should be true throughout the coat, with the roots and tips being of same shade.\n\nIn case of broken-coloured cavies, i.e. any cavies with other than separately recognised combinations of colours, the colour is described in order of magnitude, i.e. a mostly lilac cavy with some cream and a speck of white would be called lilac-cream-and-white, while a mostly white cavy with a patch of red-black ticking would be white-and-golden-agouti.\n\n=== Self ===\n[[File:Satins.JPG|thumb|A black and a pink eyed white cavy. Both are Satin Short Hairs.]]\nA self cavy is uniformly of one colour, without any ticking or patterning. Self guinea pigs come in a variety of colours. The colours include black, chocolate, red, golden, buff, cream, white, lilac, beige, and slate.\n\n=== Ticked ===\n[[File:D\u00f6sendes Hausmeerschweinchen.JPG|thumb|A golden-agouti-and-golden cavy.]]\nTicked cavies have black series hairs with red series ticking, i.e. each individual hair has stripes of both a black and a red series colour. In case a ticked cavy also has the tortoiseshell pattern, the red series patches are uniformly coloured while the black series patch.\n\nAn agouti cavy has a solid coloured belly and is otherwise fully ticked. Two common variations are the golden agouti, with black and red, and the silver agouti, with black and white. Any other color combinations in the USA are called dilute agouti.\n\nSolid agouti \nA solid agouti is completely ticked. Its variations are referred to like normal agoutis, i.e. a solid agouti with black and red would be called a golden solid agouti, and so forth.\n\n=== Patterned ===\n[[File:A Guinea pig and its carrot.jpg|thumb|A black and buff brindle Abyssinian pet cavy.]]\n[[File:Cavia porcellus, 'black-and-tan' coloring.jpg|thumb|A black-and-tan cavy.]]\n;Brindle\nA brindle cavy has intermixed hairs of both black and red series colours throughout their coats, with no ticking. An ideal show brindle appears uniformly coloured, with both series appearing evenly all over.\n\n;Dutch\nA Dutch cavy has a specific white pattern: a blaze on the face, a wide white band around the neck, chest, and the belly, including the front paws, and white tips on the hind feet. The pattern is essentially the same as the Dutch pattern in rabbits, and was named after it.\n\n;Himalayan\nA Himalayan cavy has a white body with coloured points (face, ears, feet). It is an [[acromelanic]], i.e. temperature-responding colouration, and its degree of darkness depends on how cool or warm the cavy is kept in. Show Himalayans should have black or dark brown points with ruby, i.e. dark red, eyes. The darkest areas should be the face, paws, and the feet.\n\nA Himalayan cavy is born solid white, the points slowly gaining colour after a few weeks. These guinea pigs are thought{{by whom|date=June 2014}} to originate in southeast Asia, similar to the [[Himalayan (cat)|Himalayan]], [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]] and related cat breeds.\n\n;Magpie\nA magpie cavy is a particular form of brindle, with black for the black series and white for the red series. It can easily be confused with Roan, although in magpie the white hairs can appear anywhere on the cavy.\n\n;Tan, otter, fox\nA tan cavy is an otherwise solid black, with red ticking around the muzzle, around the eyes, in spots above the eyes, under the neck and the belly, and sparsely on the lower sides. Otter and fox cavies have yellow and white ticking, respectively. Different shades are named after the black series shade, for instance black otter, lilac-and-tan, and grey fox.\n\n;Tortoiseshell\nA tortoiseshell (\"tortie\" for short) cavy has patches of red and black. An ideal show tortoiseshell cavy has regular, well-defined patches of each colour on each side, and appears to have lengthwise \"seams\" on its back and belly. Diluted tortoiseshells are called '''broken colours''', and diluted tortoiseshell-and-whites '''tricolours'''. They follow the same pattern ideal.\n\n;Roan and Dalmatian\n{{Main|Roan (color)#Roan guinea pigs}}\nA roan cavy has white hairs evenly intermixed on their body, while a Dalmatian cavy has a white body with coloured spots. The latter is named after the spotted [[Dalmatian dog]], and is not actually from [[Dalmatia]]. The head and the rump are mostly coloured in both varieties. They are caused by the same gene, and whether a cavy appears roan or Dalmatian is defined by modifier factors. Many cavies have an intermediate roan/Dalmatian pattern, and these varieties are challenging to successfully breed in show quality.\n\nThe roan/Dalmatian factor, sometimes called the \"lethal white gene\" or simply \"lethal gene\", is an incomplete dominant. It is lethal when homozygous, resulting in full white pups with varying combinations of deafness, blindness, loss of smell, and deformities. Some homozygous pups may survive for some time, while others die soon after birth if not euthanised. Most roan/Dalmatian breeders breed roan/Dalmatian solely to non-carriers to avoid the 50% risk of homozygous pups for breeding carrier to carrier.\n\nWhile the roan/Dalmatian factor is consistently visible in heterozygous carriers that do not have other factors producing white hair, the pattern can be masked by extreme dilution (resulting in full white colouration) or extreme white spotting.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Cavia porcellus}}\n* [http://cavycouncil.org.au/ Home page for the Australian National Cavy Council Inc]\n* [http://www.zianet.com/nstcbbt/genetics.html Cavy genetics]\n* [http://www.acbaonline.com/breeds.html List of breeds from the American Cavy Breeders Association]\n*[https://myperkypet.com/guinea-pig-care/ Tips for a happy Cavy (GUIDE) - Guinea Pig Care]\n\n{{Breed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Guinea Pig Breeds}}\n[[Category:Guinea pigs|.]]\n[[Category:Lists of breeds]]\n[[Category:Mammal breeds|Guinea pig]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}\n[[File:Peruvian cavy.jpg|thumb|A prize-winning lilac-and-white Silkie]]\nThere are many '''[[breed]]s of [[Guinea pigs|guinea pig or cavy]]''' which have been developed since its [[domestication]] ca. 5000 BC. Breeds vary widely in appearance and purpose, ranging from  show breeds with long, flowing hair to those in use as [[model organisms]] by science. From ca. 1200 AD to the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]] in 1532, selective breeding by [[Indigenous peoples in South America|indigenous South American people]] resulted in many [[landrace]] varieties of domestic guinea pigs, which form the basis for some of the modern, formal breeds.<ref name=walker>{{cite book | last = Nowak | first = Ronald M. | title = Walker's Mammals of the World | url = https://archive.org/details/walkersmammalsof0002nowa | url-access = registration | edition = 6th | year = 1999 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/walkersmammalsof0002nowa/page/1667 1667\u20131669] | isbn = 0-8018-5789-9}}</ref>  Early Andean varieties were primarily kept as agricultural stock for food, and efforts at improving the guinea pig as a food source continue to the modern era.\n\nWith the export of guinea pigs to Europe in the 15th century, the goal in breeding shifted to focus on the development of appealing pets. To this end, various [[Animal fancy|competitive breeding]] organizations were founded by fanciers. The [[American Cavy Breeders Association]], an adjunct to the [[American Rabbit Breeders Association]], is the governing body in the United States and Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution |url=http://www.acbaonline.com/constitution.html |publisher=American Cavy Breeders Association |date=2006-09-29 |accessdate=2007-03-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405184705/http://www.acbaonline.com/constitution.html |archivedate=2007-04-05 }}</ref> The [[British Cavy Council]] governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom.

New breeds continue to emerge in the 21st century.\n\nThough there are many breeds of guinea pig, only a few breeds are commonly found on the show table as pets. Most guinea pigs found as pets were either found undesirable{{clarify|undesirable for showing or as pets?|date=March 2013}} by breeders or were bred to be pleasant pets regardless of how well they meet the breed standard of perfection. The English/American Short-haired, the Abyssinian (rough-coated), the Peruvian (long-coated), and the Sheltie (also known as Silkie, long-coated) breeds are those most frequently seen as pets, and the former three are the core breeds in the history of the competitive showing of guinea pigs. In addition to their standard form, nearly all breeds come in a Satin variant. Satins, due to their hollow hair shafts, possess coats of a special gloss and shine. However, there is growing evidence that the genes responsible for the satin coat also can cause severe bone problems, including [[osteodystrophy]] and [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]].<ref>Jordan, Julia.

The body should be strong and of compact build. Coat colour should in all variations be clearly defined and thorough from root to tip. These standards are best met by long established, commonly bred breeds, as their breeders have had enough time and animals to effectively breed for these qualities. The coat colour ideal of good definition and thoroughness is rarely met by other than the smooth-coated breeds, which have had well established, separate breeding lines for different colours.\n\n== American ==\n[[File:Guinea pig Lucas.JPG|thumb|An American [[guinea pig]].]]\nThe most common guinea pig breed, the American guinea pig, is a recognized breed by [[American Rabbit Breeders Association]] (ARBA). They are entered and shown in ARBA competitions in nineteen color classifications; [[Black]], [[Cream (colour)|Cream]], Red, White, Any Other Self (Beige, Chocolate, Lilac, Red-Eyed Orange), Brindle, Roan, Dilute Solid, Golden Solid, Silver Solid, Dilute Agouti, Golden Agouti, Silver Agouti, Dalmatian, Dutch, Himalayan, Tortoise Shell & White, Any Other Marked (Broken Color and Tortoise Shell), and Tan Pattern (Black Tan, Blue Tan, Chocolate Tan, Beige Tan, and Lilac Tan). The American guinea pig is to be posed with the hind feet under the animal and the front feet slightly ahead of the shoulders, and should not be forced into a cobby position or stretched out.\n\nThe American should have a broad shoulder, Roman nose, and full crown, and the coat is to be short and silky. The coat is faulted for feathering, harshness, or being thin or long. Contestants are disqualified for ridges, rosettes, side whiskers, or a Satin sheen, though this should not be confused with the natural luster of some varieties. The ears are to be drooping but not fallen, and the eyes are to be bold and bright.\n\nThe American is known for its sweet and docile personality, and is considered by many an excellent breed of cavy for new owners.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=08gvj-g6k1oC&pg=PA22&dq=American+guinea+pig&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiizcvvkJ7KAhVDzz4KHXAmBw8Q6AEIHzAB#v=onepage&q=American%2520guinea%2520pig&f=false|title=The Complete Guinea Pig Care Guide|last=Products|first=Cash Flow|publisher=CashFlowProducts.com|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== White Crested ==\n\nThe White Crested is similar to the American, but they have one white rosette on the forehead. The breed standards and ideals are nearly identical, with the exception that a White Crested cavy's crest should be completely of a color different from the rest of the animal. Most usually the crest is white, as necessitated by the ACBA standard. No other white hair should be present in the animal. By this standard, White Cresteds are not bred in colourations that have white anywhere on the body, such as Dutch, roan, and Dalmatian.\n\n== Satin versions ==\n\nThe satin is a variety with a characteristic satin-like, almost glassy sheen to its coat as its name suggests. The hair shaft on a true Satin cavy is to be hollow. The genetic factor for satin coat is recessive and found in all types of coat, long, rough, curly and short. Satin coat is linked to [[Osteodystrophy]] (OD), an incurable and potentially painful [[metabolic disease]] of the bones.

Required head furnishings (5 points by ARBA standard) include a well formed mustache and an erect mane running down the head.\n\nAbyssinians are deemed by many as good pets for experienced owners of exotic animals but their excitable nature makes them not necessarily a good choice for first time cavy owners.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guineapighub.com/abyssinian-guinea-pig.html|title=The Abyssinian Guinea Pig Guide|website=www.guineapighub.com|access-date=2016-05-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507145816/http://www.guineapighub.com/abyssinian-guinea-pig.html|archive-date=2016-05-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Teddy ==\n\n[[Image:Teddy guinea pig.jpg|right|thumb|Teddy Guinea Pig]]\nA Teddy has a short, rough, very dense and springy coat that stands up all over the body. The hair typically grows to a moderate length and generally makes this breed resemble a soft toy more than any other.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guineapighub.com/teddy-guinea-pig.html|title=Teddy Guinea Pig - A Quick Guide|website=www.guineapighub.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}</ref> Another unique feature of the Teddies in the USA is the relatively long hair coating their bellies. The Teddy has a kinky, springy coat that is famous for its soft, cuddly quality, often compared to an old teddy bear. They come in Plush Coat and Harsh Coat, the plush coated animals having a softer coat, and the harsh coated with a coarser texture to the hair.\n\n== Hairless ==\nFew varieties of hairless Guinea pig exist, the most prevalent breeds being the [[Skinny pig]] and the Baldwin. They are two separate breeds, with different genetic factors rendering them hairless. Hairless cavies in general need warmer accommodation and more energy-rich food to compensate for the loss of body heat. They are also susceptible to draught, drying of the skin, and skin infections without careful husbandry.\n\n=== Skinny ===\n[[File:Skinny Pig.jpg|right|thumb|Skinny Pig]]\n{{Main|Skinny pig}}\nThe Skinny is a mostly hairless breed, with some short rough hair on the face and the feet. Pups are born nearly hairless.\n\nThe breed was developed from a hairless laboratory strain crossed with Teddies and other haired breeds.\n\n=== Baldwin ===\n{{Main|Baldwin guinea pig}}\nThe Baldwin is a nearly hairless breed. Baldwins are born with a full coat, which sheds out with age until only a little hair remains on the feet.\n\nThe breed was developed from spontaneously mutated pups born to American Crested parents of a single breeder.\n\n== Colourations ==\nCavies of various breeds have several colourations and patterns. For short-coated cavies, most colours constitute breed variations bred and shown separately from other colours. All colourations should be true throughout the coat, with the roots and tips being of same shade.\n\nIn case of broken-coloured cavies, i.e. any cavies with other than separately recognised combinations of colours, the colour is described in order of magnitude, i.e. a mostly lilac cavy with some cream and a speck of white would be called lilac-cream-and-white, while a mostly white cavy with a patch of red-black ticking would be white-and-golden-agouti.\n\n=== Self ===\n[[File:Satins.JPG|thumb|A black and a pink eyed white cavy. Both are Satin Short Hairs.]]\nA self cavy is uniformly of one colour, without any ticking or patterning. Self guinea pigs come in a variety of colours. The colours include black, chocolate, red, golden, buff, cream, white, lilac, beige, and slate.\n\n=== Ticked ===\n[[File:D\u00f6sendes Hausmeerschweinchen.JPG|thumb|A golden-agouti-and-golden cavy.]]\nTicked cavies have black series hairs with red series ticking, i.e. each individual hair has stripes of both a black and a red series colour. In case a ticked cavy also has the tortoiseshell pattern, the red series patches are uniformly coloured while the black series patch.\n\nAn agouti cavy has a solid coloured belly and is otherwise fully ticked. Two common variations are the golden agouti, with black and red, and the silver agouti, with black and white. Any other color combinations in the USA are called dilute agouti.\n\nSolid agouti \nA solid agouti is completely ticked. Its variations are referred to like normal agoutis, i.e. a solid agouti with black and red would be called a golden solid agouti, and so forth.\n\n=== Patterned ===\n[[File:A Guinea pig and its carrot.jpg|thumb|A black and buff brindle Abyssinian pet cavy.]]\n[[File:Cavia porcellus, 'black-and-tan' coloring.jpg|thumb|A black-and-tan cavy.]]\n;Brindle\nA brindle cavy has intermixed hairs of both black and red series colours throughout their coats, with no ticking. An ideal show brindle appears uniformly coloured, with both series appearing evenly all over.\n\n;Dutch\nA Dutch cavy has a specific white pattern: a blaze on the face, a wide white band around the neck, chest, and the belly, including the front paws, and white tips on the hind feet. The pattern is essentially the same as the Dutch pattern in rabbits, and was named after it.\n\n;Himalayan\nA Himalayan cavy has a white body with coloured points (face, ears, feet). It is an [[acromelanic]], i.e. temperature-responding colouration, and its degree of darkness depends on how cool or warm the cavy is kept in. Show Himalayans should have black or dark brown points with ruby, i.e. dark red, eyes. The darkest areas should be the face, paws, and the feet.\n\nA Himalayan cavy is born solid white, the points slowly gaining colour after a few weeks. These guinea pigs are thought{{by whom|date=June 2014}} to originate in southeast Asia, similar to the [[Himalayan (cat)|Himalayan]], [[Siamese (cat)|Siamese]] and related cat breeds.\n\n;Magpie\nA magpie cavy is a particular form of brindle, with black for the black series and white for the red series. It can easily be confused with Roan, although in magpie the white hairs can appear anywhere on the cavy.\n\n;Tan, otter, fox\nA tan cavy is an otherwise solid black, with red ticking around the muzzle, around the eyes, in spots above the eyes, under the neck and the belly, and sparsely on the lower sides. Otter and fox cavies have yellow and white ticking, respectively. Different shades are named after the black series shade, for instance black otter, lilac-and-tan, and grey fox.\n\n;Tortoiseshell\nA tortoiseshell (\"tortie\" for short) cavy has patches of red and black. An ideal show tortoiseshell cavy has regular, well-defined patches of each colour on each side, and appears to have lengthwise \"seams\" on its back and belly. Diluted tortoiseshells are called '''broken colours''', and diluted tortoiseshell-and-whites '''tricolours'''. They follow the same pattern ideal.\n\n;Roan and Dalmatian\n{{Main|Roan (color)#Roan guinea pigs}}\nA roan cavy has white hairs evenly intermixed on their body, while a Dalmatian cavy has a white body with coloured spots. The latter is named after the spotted [[Dalmatian dog]], and is not actually from [[Dalmatia]]. The head and the rump are mostly coloured in both varieties. They are caused by the same gene, and whether a cavy appears roan or Dalmatian is defined by modifier factors. Many cavies have an intermediate roan/Dalmatian pattern, and these varieties are challenging to successfully breed in show quality.\n\nThe roan/Dalmatian factor, sometimes called the \"lethal white gene\" or simply \"lethal gene\", is an incomplete dominant. It is lethal when homozygous, resulting in full white pups with varying combinations of deafness, blindness, loss of smell, and deformities. Some homozygous pups may survive for some time, while others die soon after birth if not euthanised. Most roan/Dalmatian breeders breed roan/Dalmatian solely to non-carriers to avoid the 50% risk of homozygous pups for breeding carrier to carrier.\n\nWhile the roan/Dalmatian factor is consistently visible in heterozygous carriers that do not have other factors producing white hair, the pattern can be masked by extreme dilution (resulting in full white colouration) or extreme white spotting.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Cavia porcellus}}\n* [http://cavycouncil.org.au/ Home page for the Australian National Cavy Council Inc]\n* [http://www.zianet.com/nstcbbt/genetics.html Cavy genetics]\n* [http://www.acbaonline.com/breeds.html List of breeds from the American Cavy Breeders Association]\n*[https://myperkypet.com/guinea-pig-care/ Tips for a happy Cavy (GUIDE) - Guinea Pig Care]\n\n{{Breed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Guinea Pig Breeds}}\n[[Category:Guinea pigs|.]]\n[[Category:Lists of breeds]]\n[[Category:Mammal breeds|Guinea pig]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toBritain(link changed toUnited Kingdom) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_guinea_pig_breeds"}
