He was the son of and co-ruler with [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan II]], who was murdered in 1451 in a conspiracy organized by his brother and Stephen's uncle [[Peter Aaron|Peter III Aaron]] who took the throne. Stephen fled to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301\u20131526)|Hungary]], and later to  [[Wallachia]], but with the support of [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad III Dracula]], [[Voivode of Wallachia]], he returned to Moldavia, forcing Aaron to seek refuge in [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Poland]] in the summer of 1457. [[Teoctist I of Moldavia|Teoctist I]], [[Metropolis of Moldavia and Bukovina|Metropolitan of Moldavia]], [[Anointing|anointed]] Stephen prince. He attacked Poland and prevented [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], [[King of Poland]], from supporting Peter Aaron, but eventually acknowledged Casimir's suzerainty in 1459.\n\nStephen decided to recapture Chilia (now [[Kiliya]] in Ukraine), an important port on the Danube, which brought him into conflict with Hungary and Wallachia. He besieged the town during the Ottoman invasion of Wallachia in 1462, but was seriously wounded during the siege. Two years later, he captured the town. He promised support to the leaders of the [[Unio Trium Nationum|Three Nations of Transylvania]] against [[Matthias Corvinus]], [[King of Hungary]], in 1467. Corvinus invaded Moldavia, but Stephen defeated him in the [[Battle of Baia]]. Peter Aaron attacked Moldavia with Hungarian support in December 1470, but was also defeated by Stephen and executed, along with the [[Moldavian boyars]] who still endorsed him. Stephen restored old fortresses and built new ones, which improved Moldavia's defence system as well as strengthened central administration.\n\nOttoman expansion threatened Moldavian ports in the region of the [[Black Sea]]. In 1473, Stephen stopped paying tribute (''[[hara\u00e7]]'') to the [[Ottoman sultan]] and launched a [[Moldavian\u2013Ottoman Wars|series of campaigns against Wallachia]] in order to replace its rulers \u2013 who had accepted Ottoman suzerainty \u2013 with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. However, each prince who seized the throne with Stephen's support was soon forced to pay homage to the sultan. Stephen eventually defeated a large Ottoman army in the [[Battle of Vaslui]] in 1475. Stephen was referred to as ''[[Athleta Christi]]'' (\"Champion of Christ\") by [[Pope Sixtus IV]], even though Moldavia's hopes for military support went unfulfilled.\n\nThe following year, Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed II]] routed Stephen in the [[Battle of Valea Alb\u0103]], but the lack of provisions and the outbreak of a plague forced him to withdraw from Moldavia. Taking advantage of a truce with Matthias Corvinus, the Ottomans captured Chilia, their [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] allies Cetatea Alb\u0103 (now [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]] in Ukraine) in 1483. Although Corvinus granted two [[Transylvania]]n estates to Stephen, the Moldavian prince paid homage to Casimir, who promised to support him to regain Chilia and Cetatea Alb\u0103. Stephen's efforts to capture the two ports ended in failure. From 1486, he again paid a yearly tribute to the Ottomans. During the following years, dozens of stone churches and monasteries were built in Moldavia, which contributed to the development of a specific Moldavian architecture.\n\nCasimir IV's successor, [[John I Albert]], wanted to grant Moldavia to his younger brother, [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund]], but Stephen's diplomacy prevented him from invading Moldavia for years. John Albert attacked Moldavia in 1497, but Stephen and his Hungarian and Ottoman allies routed the Polish army in the [[Battle of the Cosmin Forest]]. Stephen again tried to recapture Chilia and Cetatea Alb\u0103, but had to acknowledge the loss of the two ports to the Ottomans in 1503. During his last years, his son and co-ruler [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed|Bogdan III]] played an active role in government. Stephen's long rule represented a period of stability in the history of Moldavia. From the 16th century onwards both his subjects and foreigners remembered him as a great ruler. Modern Romanians regard him as one of their greatest national heroes, although he also endures as a cult figure in [[Moldovenism]]. After the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] canonized him in 1992, he is venerated as \"Stephen the Great and Holy\" (''\u0218tefan cel Mare \u0219i Sf\u00e2nt'').\n\n== Early life ==\n\n[[File:Moldova1483.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A map depicting Moldavia bordered by the river Dniester, the Black Sea and the Carpathian Mountains|The [[Principality of Moldavia]] in 1483]]\n\nStephen was the son of [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan]], who was a son of [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander the Good]], [[Prince of Moldavia]].{{sfn|P\u0103un|2016|p=131}} Stephen's mother, Maria Oltea,{{sfn|P\u0103un|2016|p=131}}{{sfn|Iliescu|2006|p=79}}{{sfn|Demciuc|2004|p=4}} was most probably related to the princes of [[Wallachia]], according to historian [[Radu Florescu]].{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=66}} The date of Stephen's birth is unknown,{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Treptow|Popa|1996|p=190}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} though historians estimate that he was born between 1433 and 1440.{{sfn|Brezianu|Sp\u00e2nu|2007|p=338}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=220}} One church [[diptych]] records that he had five siblings: brothers Ioachim, Ioan, Christea; and sisters Sorea and Maria.{{sfn|Iliescu|2006|p=79}}{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|pp=39-40}} Some of Stephen's biographers hypothesize that C\u00e2rstea Arbore, father of the statesman [[Luca Arbore]], was the prince's fourth brother, or that C\u00e2rstea was the same as Ioachim.{{sfn|E\u0219anu|2013|p=136}} These links with the high-ranking [[Moldavian boyars]] are known to have been preserved through matrimonial connections: Maria, who died in 1486, was the wife of \u0218endrea, gatekeeper of [[Suceava]]; Stephen's other brother-in-law, Isaia, also held high office at his court.{{sfn|Demciuc|2004|pp=4, 8}}{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=40}}\n\nThe death of Alexander the Good in 1432 gave rise to a succession crisis that lasted more than two decades.{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=256}}{{sfn|Bolovan|Constantiniu|Michelson|Pop|1997|p=103}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} Stephen's father seized the throne in 1449 after defeating one of his relatives with the support of [[John Hunyadi]], Regent-Governor of Hungary.{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=256}}{{sfn|Ciobanu|1991|p=34}} Stephen was styled ''[[voivode]]'' in his father's charters, showing that he had been made his father's heir and co-ruler.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|p=18}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|pp=31, 212}} Bogdan acknowledged the suzerainty of Hunyadi in 1450.{{sfn|Ciobanu|1991|pp=34-35}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} Stephen fled to Hungary after [[Peter III Aaron]] (who was also Alexander the Good's son) murdered Bogdan in October 1451.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=66}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=59}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=212}}\n\nVlad Dracula (who had lived in Moldavia during Bogdan II's reign) invaded Wallachia and seized the throne with the support of Hunyadi in 1456.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|pp=58, 61}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} Stephen either accompanied Vlad to Wallachia during the military campaign or joined him after Vlad became the ruler of Wallachia.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=98}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} According to reports from the 1480s, Stephen spent part of that interval in [[Br\u0103ila]], where he fathered an illegitimate son, Mircea.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|pp=38, 40-41}} With the assistance of Vlad, Stephen stormed into Moldavia at the head of an army 6,000 strong in the spring of 1457.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=99}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|pp=18-19}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=34}} According to Moldavian chronicles, \"men from the Lower Country\" (the southern region of Moldavia) joined him.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=99}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Papacostea|1996|p=5}} The 17th-century [[Grigore Ureche]] wrote: \"Stephen routed Peter Aaron [[Battle of Dolje\u0219ti and Orbic|at Dolje\u0219ti]] on 12 April, but Peter Aaron left Moldavia for Poland only after Stephen inflicted a second defeat on him at Orbic.\"{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=212}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=99}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|pp=18-19}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Early campaigns ===\n\nOne widely accepted theory, based on Ureche, states that an assembly of boyars and Orthodox clergymen [[Acclamatio|acclaimed]] Stephen the ruler of Moldavia at Direptate, a meadow near Suceava. According to scholar Constantin Rezachievici, this elective custom has no precedent before the 17th century, and appears superfluous in Stephen's case; he argues that it was a legend fabricated by Ureche.{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|pp=17\u201318, 20\u201330}} While this election remains uncertain, various historians agree that [[Teoctist I of Moldavia|Teoctist I]], [[Metropolis of Moldavia and Bukovina|Metropolitan of Moldavia]], [[Anointing|anointed]] Stephen prince.{{sfn|Demciuc|2004|p=3}}{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|pp=25, 27}}{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=266}}{{sfn|Mure\u0219an|2008|pp=106-108, 138}} To emphasize the sacred nature of his rule, Stephen styled himself \"[[By the Grace of God]], ... Stephen voivode, lord (or ''[[hospodar]]'') of the Moldavian lands\" on 13 September 1457.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|pp=32-33}} His use of Christian devices for legitimization overlapped with a troubled context for Moldavian Orthodoxy: the [[Council of Florence|attempted Catholic\u2013Orthodox union]] had divided the [[Byzantine Rite]] churches into supporters and dissidents; likewise, the [[Fall of Constantinople]] had encouraged local bishops to consider themselves independent of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarchy]]. There is a long standing dispute about whether Teoctist was a dissenter, belonging to one of the several emancipated Orthodox jurisdictions, or a loyalist of [[Isidore II of Constantinople|Patriarch Isidore]].{{sfn|Mure\u0219an|2008}} Historian Dan Ioan Mure\u0219an argues that the evidence is for the latter option, because Moldavia appears on the list of Patriarchate jurisdictions, and because Stephen, though he tested the Patriarch by sometimes using imperial titles such as ''[[tsar]]'' by 1473, was never threatened with [[excommunication]].{{sfn|Mure\u0219an|2008|pp=102-180}}\n\nAs one of his earliest actions as prince, Stephen attacked Poland to prevent Casimir IV from supporting Peter Aaron in 1458.{{sfn|Demciuc|2004|p=3}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|pp=38, 213}} This first military campaign \"established his credentials as a military commander of stature\", according to historian Jonathan Eagles.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=38}} However, he wanted to avoid prolonged conflict with Poland, because the recapture of Chilia was his principal aim.{{sfn|Ciobanu|1991|p=43}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} Chilia was an important port on the Danube that [[Petru III of Moldavia|Peter II of Moldavia]]

Empire, expelling from Moldavia the [[Franciscans]], who were agitating for a united church and a crusade.{{sfn|Mure\u0219an|2008|p=110}} Stephen continued to pay the yearly tribute to the Ottoman

Initially, [[Censorship in Communist Romania|censorship]] toned down or removed references to his legacy in [[Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Bessarabia]] or [[Pokuttya]];{{sfn|Otu|2019|pp=66-67}} in the 1980s, however, official historians claimed that Stephen was literally a \"lord of all Romanians\".{{sfn|Boia|2001|pp=140, 222, 249-250}} Iorga's book has been republished several times, including on the 500th anniversary of Stephen's death.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|pp=88-89}} On the same anniversary, Stephen was presented as a symbol of \"national identity, independence and inter-ethnic harmony\" in the [[Republic of Moldova]],{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=89}} where he also endures as the symbol of \"Moldavian particularism\"{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=140}} or \"Moldovan patriotism\".{{sfn|Cojocari|2007|p=93}} Thus, Stephen was invoked by both the [[Popular Front of Moldova]], which favored Romanian identity, and the Moldovenist [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|Party of Communists]].{{sfn|Cojocari|2007|pp=90-97, 100-102}} The latter describes Stephen as \"the founder of Moldavian statehood\", claiming direct continuity from his principality to the present-day state.{{sfn|Cojocari|2007|pp=101-104}}\n\nAs Eagles notes, \"Stephen is an ever-present icon\" in both Romania and Moldova: \"statues of his image abound; politicians cite him as an exemplar; schools and [[\u0218tefan cel Mare University of Suceava|a university bear his name]]; villages and the main thoroughfares of towns and cities are named after him; there is a [[\u0218tefan cel Mare metro station]] in central Bucharest; and his crowned head has adorned ''every'' banknote in the [[Post-Soviet states|post-Soviet]] Moldovan republic\".{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=1}} According to a 1999 [[opinion poll]], more than 13% of the participants regarded Stephen the Great as the most important personality who had \"influenced the destiny of the Romanians for the better\".{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=17}} Seven years later, during a programme called the ''[[100 Greatest Romanians]]'' on [[Romanian Television]], he was voted \"the greatest Romanian of all time\".{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=83}}\n\n=== Holy ruler ===\n{{Infobox saint\n|name= Saint Stephen the Great\n|image=Tablou votiv Manastirea Dobrovat 1503.jpg\n|caption=Votive depiction of Stephen at [[Dobrov\u0103\u021b Monastery]]\n|feast_day=July 2\n|venerated_in= [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]\n|titles= Holy Voivode\n|canonized_date=July 12, 1992\n|canonized_place=[[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]\n|canonized_by=[[Romanian Orthodox Church]]\n|major_shrine=[[Putna Monastery]]\n|suppressed_date=\n|issues=\n}}\n\nIn [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] legends, Romanian stories, and Moldavian chronicles alike, Stephen's victories against the Ottomans and Hungarians were already regarded as God-inspired, or as placed under the direct patronage of various saints ([[Saint George|George]], [[Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Demetrius]], [[Procopius of Scythopolis|Procopius]], or [[Saint Mercurius|Mercurius]]).{{sfn|Cristea|2016|pp=316-340}}{{sfn|Schipor|2004|p=206}} Worship of Stephen himself was first recorded in the 1570s,{{sfn|Simon|2009|p=233}} but, according to Ureche, he had been regarded as a saint soon after his funeral: \"not on account of his soul ... for he was a man with sins ... but on account of the great deeds he accomplished\".{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=77}} The positive nuances of Ureche's report were also repeated by [[Miron Costin]].{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=77}} \n\nThe abbot of Putna Monastery, Artimon Bortnic, initiated the investigation of the tomb room of the monastery in 1851, referring to important shrines in Russia and Moldavia.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=110}} In 1857 (a year after Stephen's tomb was opened), the priest and journalist Iraclie Porumbescu already wrote of the \"holy bones of Putna\".{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=93}} In at least some legends attested by 1903, the voivode is depicted as an immortal [[King asleep in mountain|sleeping hero]], or, alternatively, as the ruler of heaven.{{sfn|Schipor|2004|p=202}} However, Stephen the Great was ignored when the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] canonized the first Romanian saints in the 1950s.{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=73}}\n\n[[Teoctist Ar\u0103pa\u0219u|Teoctist]], [[Patriarch of All Romania]], canonized Stephen along with 12 other saints at [[Saint Spyridon the New Church]] in Bucharest on 21 June 1992.{{sfn|Ramet|1998|p=195}} On this occasion, the patriarch emphasized that Stephen had been a defender of Christianity and protector of his people.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=78}} He also underlined that Stephen had built churches during his reign.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=78}} Stephen's feast day is July 2 (the day of his death) in the calendar of the Romanian Orthodox Church. On his first feast after his canonization, a new ceremony was held to celebrate Stephen the Great and Saint in Putna.{{sfn|Ramet|1998|p=195}} 15,000 people (including the [[President of Romania]] at the time, [[Ion Iliescu]], and two ministers) attended the event.{{sfn|Ramet|1998|p=196}} Patriarch Teoctist noted that \"God has brought us together under the same skies, just as Stephen rallied us under the same flag in the past.\"{{sfn|Ramet|1998|p=196}}\n\n==Arms==\nStephen's rule consolidated the usage of the [[coat of arms of Moldavia]], featuring the [[aurochs]] head (first attested in 1387), sometimes as a [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] atop his personal arms. He revived the elaborate design introduced under [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander the Good]], which also featured a [[Rose (heraldry)|rose]], [[crescent]], [[Sun (heraldry)|sun]] and star (often, but not always, [[Five-pointed star|five-pointed]]); its [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]] remain unknown.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=83-85, 98-120}} This arrangement was not familiar to heraldists in Western Europe. By the 1530s, they represented Moldavia with [[attributed arms]] featuring [[Maure]]s; these arms, though originally used for Wallachia, possibly echoed Stephen's victories over the Ottomans.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=77-81, 126}}\n\nThe personal arms and [[heraldic flag]]s used by Stephen have been the topic of additional scrutiny and debate. Stephen is known to have used a ''[[Division of the field|party per cross]]'' shield with one striped quarter, but the colors are uncertain: one prevailing interpretation is that the dominant tinctures were [[Or (heraldry)|or]] and [[Vert (heraldry)|vert]], although they may also have been [[gules]] and [[argent]]. These may derive from the colors used by the [[House of Basarab]] (which were possibly used by Stephen's in-law [[Radu the Fair]]), from the [[coat of arms of Hungary]], or from a purely Moldavian tradition.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=67-68, 107, 110}} The division and the striped pattern are possibly Hungarian; they survived in some of Stephen's seals even during his dispute with the Hungarian crown. He also continued to use the ''[[fleur-de-lis]]'', an [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] symbol, but altered it into a \"double-headed lily\", then renounced it altogether.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=109, 111-112, 119-120}} Similarly, he used the [[Cross of Lorraine]], [[Cross patt\u00e9e|patt\u00e9e]], possibly in reference to the [[Pahonia]]. Following his 1489 dispute with Poland, that charge was altered into a double [[cross fleury]].{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=118, 119}} \n\nStephen's heraldic symbols progressively merged with those attributed to the [[House of Mu\u0219at]], and were intensively used by all princes who claimed full or partial descent from Alexander the Good\u2014including [[Peter the Lame]], a Wallachian pretender to Moldavia's throne.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=96, 99-100, 102-108, 111-120}} The Putna tombstones of Stephen's two sons who died during his lifetime, Bogdan and Peter, already display the aurochs within the \"Mu\u0219at coat-of-arms\".{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=98-99}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|pp=102-103}} \n\nA Moldavian banner also survives in hand-colored versions illustrating [[Johannes de Thurocz]]'s ''[[Chronica Hungarorum]]'', with varying tinctures. These were first identified as Stephen's flags by [[Constantin Karadja]], and described by later authors as a version of the or-an-vert scheme in the coat of arms.{{sfn|Tiron|2012|pp=71-75}} Other clues suggest that the field was a solid one of or, charged with an aurochs of or, but also that the preferred \"single Moldavian\" color was gules.{{sfn|Tiron|2012|pp=76-80}} Gules is also the color of Stephen's alleged [[war flag]], defaced with an icon of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] and donated by the prince himself to [[Zograf monastery]]. However, scholar Petre \u0218. N\u0103sturel cautions that this may not be a heraldic object of any kind, but rather a [[votive offering]]. The \"war flag\", he notes, is to small to carry in battle, and does not match with images in either Thurocz or [[Marcin Bielski]], nor with the description in [[Alexander Guagnini]].{{sfn|N\u0103sturel|2005|pp=48-49}}\n\n<gallery class=center>\nFile:Moldavia's coat of Arms of 1481.jpg|alt=A coat of arms depicting the head of an aurochs with a crescent and a star over it|[[Coat of arms of Moldavia]] at [[Putna Monastery]]\nFile:Coa Romania Country History \u0218tefan cel Mare (1457-1504) v2.svg|alt=A coat of arms depicting stripes, a double cross, roses and sun|One variant of Stephen's personal coat of arms, with hypothetical [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]]\nFile:Moldavia - Ulrich von Richental.svg|alt=A coat of arms with three black heads|[[Attributed arms]] of Moldavia, with three [[Maure]]s\nFile:Battle Flag of Moldavia (1467) - 2nd version.svg|alt=Triangular flag with aurochs head and stripes|One possible rendition of the Moldavian flag, based on [[Johannes de Thurocz]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Neam\u021b Citadel]]\n*[[Borze\u0219ti Church]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, Arge\u0219]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, Bac\u0103u]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, Neam\u021b]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, Olt]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, Vaslui]]\n*[[Saligny, Constan\u021ba]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|18em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Achim |first=Viorel |year=2004 |title=The Roma in Romanian History |publisher=Central European University Press |isbn=963-9241-84-9 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bain |first=Robert Nisbet |authorlink=Robert Nisbet Bain |year=1908 |title=Slavonic Europe.

He was the son of and co-ruler with [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan II]], who was murdered in 1451 in a conspiracy organized by his brother and Stephen's uncle [[Peter Aaron|Peter III Aaron]] who took the throne. Stephen fled to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301\u20131526)|Hungary]], and later to  [[Wallachia]], but with the support of [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad III Dracula]], [[Voivode of Wallachia]], he returned to Moldavia, forcing Aaron to seek refuge in [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Poland]] in the summer of 1457. [[Teoctist I of Moldavia|Teoctist I]], [[Metropolis of Moldavia and Bukovina|Metropolitan of Moldavia]], [[Anointing|anointed]] Stephen prince. He attacked Poland and prevented [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], [[King of Poland]], from supporting Peter Aaron, but eventually acknowledged Casimir's suzerainty in 1459.\n\nStephen decided to recapture Chilia (now [[Kiliya]] in Ukraine), an important port on the Danube, which brought him into conflict with Hungary and Wallachia. He besieged the town during the Ottoman invasion of Wallachia in 1462, but was seriously wounded during the siege. Two years later, he captured the town. He promised support to the leaders of the [[Unio Trium Nationum|Three Nations of Transylvania]] against [[Matthias Corvinus]], [[King of Hungary]], in 1467. Corvinus invaded Moldavia, but Stephen defeated him in the [[Battle of Baia]]. Peter Aaron attacked Moldavia with Hungarian support in December 1470, but was also defeated by Stephen and executed, along with the [[Moldavian boyars]] who still endorsed him. Stephen restored old fortresses and built new ones, which improved Moldavia's defence system as well as strengthened central administration.\n\nOttoman expansion threatened Moldavian ports in the region of the [[Black Sea]]. In 1473, Stephen stopped paying tribute (''[[hara\u00e7]]'') to the [[Ottoman sultan]] and launched a [[Moldavian\u2013Ottoman Wars|series of campaigns against Wallachia]] in order to replace its rulers \u2013 who had accepted Ottoman suzerainty \u2013 with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. However, each prince who seized the throne with Stephen's support was soon forced to pay homage to the sultan. Stephen eventually defeated a large Ottoman army in the [[Battle of Vaslui]] in 1475. Stephen was referred to as ''[[Athleta Christi]]'' (\"Champion of Christ\") by [[Pope Sixtus IV]], even though Moldavia's hopes for military support went unfulfilled.\n\nThe following year, Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed II]] routed Stephen in the [[Battle of Valea Alb\u0103]], but the lack of provisions and the outbreak of a plague forced him to withdraw from Moldavia. Taking advantage of a truce with Matthias Corvinus, the Ottomans captured Chilia, their [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] allies Cetatea Alb\u0103 (now [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]] in Ukraine) in 1483. Although Corvinus granted two [[Transylvania]]n estates to Stephen, the Moldavian prince paid homage to Casimir, who promised to support him to regain Chilia and Cetatea Alb\u0103. Stephen's efforts to capture the two ports ended in failure. From 1486, he again paid a yearly tribute to the Ottomans. During the following years, dozens of stone churches and monasteries were built in Moldavia, which contributed to the development of a specific Moldavian architecture.\n\nCasimir IV's successor, [[John I Albert]], wanted to grant Moldavia to his younger brother, [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund]], but Stephen's diplomacy prevented him from invading Moldavia for years. John Albert attacked Moldavia in 1497, but Stephen and his Hungarian and Ottoman allies routed the Polish army in the [[Battle of the Cosmin Forest]]. Stephen again tried to recapture Chilia and Cetatea Alb\u0103, but had to acknowledge the loss of the two ports to the Ottomans in 1503. During his last years, his son and co-ruler [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed|Bogdan III]] played an active role in government. Stephen's long rule represented a period of stability in the history of Moldavia. From the 16th century onwards both his subjects and foreigners remembered him as a great ruler. Modern Romanians regard him as one of their greatest national heroes, although he also endures as a cult figure in [[Moldovenism]]. After the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] canonized him in 1992, he is venerated as \"Stephen the Great and Holy\" (''\u0218tefan cel Mare \u0219i Sf\u00e2nt'').\n\n== Early life ==\n\n[[File:Moldova1483.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A map depicting Moldavia bordered by the river Dniester, the Black Sea and the Carpathian Mountains|The [[Principality of Moldavia]] in 1483]]\n\nStephen was the son of [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan]], who was a son of [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander the Good]], [[Prince of Moldavia]].{{sfn|P\u0103un|2016|p=131}} Stephen's mother, Maria Oltea,{{sfn|P\u0103un|2016|p=131}}{{sfn|Iliescu|2006|p=79}}{{sfn|Demciuc|2004|p=4}} was most probably related to the princes of [[Wallachia]], according to historian [[Radu Florescu]].{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=66}} The date of Stephen's birth is unknown,{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Treptow|Popa|1996|p=190}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} though historians estimate that he was born between 1433 and 1440.{{sfn|Brezianu|Sp\u00e2nu|2007|p=338}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=220}} One church [[diptych]] records that he had five siblings: brothers Ioachim, Ioan, Christea; and sisters Sorea and Maria.{{sfn|Iliescu|2006|p=79}}{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|pp=39-40}} Some of Stephen's biographers hypothesize that C\u00e2rstea Arbore, father of the statesman [[Luca Arbore]], was the prince's fourth brother, or that C\u00e2rstea was the same as Ioachim.{{sfn|E\u0219anu|2013|p=136}} These links with the high-ranking [[Moldavian boyars]] are known to have been preserved through matrimonial connections: Maria, who died in 1486, was the wife of \u0218endrea, gatekeeper of [[Suceava]]; Stephen's other brother-in-law, Isaia, also held high office at his court.{{sfn|Demciuc|2004|pp=4, 8}}{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=40}}\n\nThe death of Alexander the Good in 1432 gave rise to a succession crisis that lasted more than two decades.{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=256}}{{sfn|Bolovan|Constantiniu|Michelson|Pop|1997|p=103}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} Stephen's father seized the throne in 1449 after defeating one of his relatives with the support of [[John Hunyadi]], Regent-Governor of Hungary.{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=256}}{{sfn|Ciobanu|1991|p=34}} Stephen was styled ''[[voivode]]'' in his father's charters, showing that he had been made his father's heir and co-ruler.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|p=18}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|pp=31, 212}} Bogdan acknowledged the suzerainty of Hunyadi in 1450.{{sfn|Ciobanu|1991|pp=34-35}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} Stephen fled to Hungary after [[Peter III Aaron]] (who was also Alexander the Good's son) murdered Bogdan in October 1451.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=66}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=59}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=212}}\n\nVlad Dracula (who had lived in Moldavia during Bogdan II's reign) invaded Wallachia and seized the throne with the support of Hunyadi in 1456.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|pp=58, 61}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} Stephen either accompanied Vlad to Wallachia during the military campaign or joined him after Vlad became the ruler of Wallachia.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=98}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} According to reports from the 1480s, Stephen spent part of that interval in [[Br\u0103ila]], where he fathered an illegitimate son, Mircea.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|pp=38, 40-41}} With the assistance of Vlad, Stephen stormed into Moldavia at the head of an army 6,000 strong in the spring of 1457.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=99}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|pp=18-19}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=34}} According to Moldavian chronicles, \"men from the Lower Country\" (the southern region of Moldavia) joined him.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=99}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Papacostea|1996|p=5}} The 17th-century [[Grigore Ureche]] wrote: \"Stephen routed Peter Aaron [[Battle of Dolje\u0219ti and Orbic|at Dolje\u0219ti]] on 12 April, but Peter Aaron left Moldavia for Poland only after Stephen inflicted a second defeat on him at Orbic.\"{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=212}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=99}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|pp=18-19}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Early campaigns ===\n\nOne widely accepted theory, based on Ureche, states that an assembly of boyars and Orthodox clergymen [[Acclamatio|acclaimed]] Stephen the ruler of Moldavia at Direptate, a meadow near Suceava. According to scholar Constantin Rezachievici, this elective custom has no precedent before the 17th century, and appears superfluous in Stephen's case; he argues that it was a legend fabricated by Ureche.{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|pp=17\u201318, 20\u201330}} While this election remains uncertain, various historians agree that [[Teoctist I of Moldavia|Teoctist I]], [[Metropolis of Moldavia and Bukovina|Metropolitan of Moldavia]], [[Anointing|anointed]] Stephen prince.{{sfn|Demciuc|2004|p=3}}{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|pp=25, 27}}{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=266}}{{sfn|Mure\u0219an|2008|pp=106-108, 138}} To emphasize the sacred nature of his rule, Stephen styled himself \"[[By the Grace of God]], ... Stephen voivode, lord (or ''[[hospodar]]'') of the Moldavian lands\" on 13 September 1457.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|pp=32-33}} His use of Christian devices for legitimization overlapped with a troubled context for Moldavian Orthodoxy: the [[Council of Florence|attempted Catholic\u2013Orthodox union]] had divided the [[Byzantine Rite]] churches into supporters and dissidents; likewise, the [[Fall of Constantinople]] had encouraged local bishops to consider themselves independent of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarchy]]. There is a long standing dispute about whether Teoctist was a dissenter, belonging to one of the several emancipated Orthodox jurisdictions, or a loyalist of [[Isidore II of Constantinople|Patriarch Isidore]].{{sfn|Mure\u0219an|2008}} Historian Dan Ioan Mure\u0219an argues that the evidence is for the latter option, because Moldavia appears on the list of Patriarchate jurisdictions, and because Stephen, though he tested the Patriarch by sometimes using imperial titles such as ''[[tsar]]'' by 1473, was never threatened with [[excommunication]].{{sfn|Mure\u0219an|2008|pp=102-180}}\n\nAs one of

\"established his credentials as a military commander of stature\", according to historian Jonathan Eagles.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=38}} However, he wanted to avoid prolonged conflict with Poland, because the recapture of Chilia was his principal aim.{{sfn|Ciobanu|1991|p=43}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} Chilia was an important port on the Danube that [[Petru III of Moldavia|Peter II of Moldavia]]

In Panu's works, Stephen appears as merely a \"Polish vassal\"; the one-time ''Junimist'' [[A. D. Xenopol]] also chided the voivode for his loss of Chilia and his supposed betrayal of Wallachia.{{sfn|Boia|2001|pp=57, 135, 189-190}}\n\nAnniversaries of the most important events of Stephen's life have been officially celebrated since the 1870s,{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=83}} including in 1871 the defiant show of solidarity at [[Putna, Suceava|Putna]]. This doubled as a protest against [[Austria-Hungary]], which had annexed Bukovina; it was organized by [[Teodor V. \u0218tefanelli]] and was notably attended by poet [[Mihai Eminescu]].{{sfn|C\u00e2ndea|1937|pp=7-10}} Nationalist interpretations still prevailed, particularly after 1881, when Eminescu dedicated his poem ''[[Doina (Eminescu)|Doina]]'' (written in the style of [[Doina|traditional Romanian song]]) to Stephen, calling upon him to leave his grave to again lead his people.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=80}}{{sfn|Boia|2001|pp=194-195, 213}}{{sfn|Papacostea|1996|p=80}} His statue was ultimately raised in [[Ia\u0219i]] in 1883.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=83}}{{sfn|Dima|Chi\u021bimia|Cornea|Todoran|1968|p=676}}\n\nOn the 400th anniversary of the voivode's death in 1904, ceremonies included the completion of a stone monument in [[B\u00e2rse\u0219ti]], by locals who claimed descent from Vr\u00e2ncioaia.{{sfn|H\u00e2rnea|1979|pp=57, 124, 135}}{{sfn|Iliescu|2006|pp=71-82}} Also then, [[Nicolae Iorga]] published Stephen's biography.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=89}} Against Xenopol's verdict, Iorga emphasized that Stephen's victories were to be attributed to the \"true unity of the whole people\" during his reign.{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=60}} Many more works of literature appeared in the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and other Romanian-inhabited regions, helping to consolidate Stephen's cultural legacy. One such contribution was the 1909 play ''[[Apus de soare]]'', by [[Barbu \u0218tef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]], including advice attributed, in the public's mind, to historical Stephen: \n{{Quote|Moldavia was not my ancestors', was not mine, and is not yours, but belongs to our descendants and our descendants' descendants to the end of time.{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=195}}}} \n\nDepicting Stephen as a dying sage, it was followed by two other Delavrancea plays, which insisted on the prince's pragmatic cruelty and the effects this had on his succession.{{sfn|Lovinescu|1998|pp=299-302}} By then, Stephen as a statesman had also become a point of reference and a benchmark for the long and stabilizing rule of [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], [[King of the Romanians]].{{sfn|Boia|2001|pp=201-203}} Over the following three decades, Stephen's deeds became the inspiration for literary works by Iorga, [[Mihail Codreanu]], and especially [[Mihail Sadoveanu]].{{sfn|Lovinescu|1998|pp=121, 178, 183, 323}} \n\nThe reading of Stephen as a [[Pan-Romanianism|pan-Romanian nationalist]] peaked during the late stages of [[Communist Romania]]. Initially, the regime looked down on Stephen's treatment of the peasantry, and only emphasized his connections with the [[East Slavs]] or his clampdown against boyardom.{{sfn|Boia|2001|pp=215, 219}} This stance was overturned by [[National communism in Romania|national communism]]. Initially, [[Censorship in Communist Romania|censorship]] toned down or removed references to his legacy in [[Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Bessarabia]] or [[Pokuttya]];{{sfn|Otu|2019|pp=66-67}} in the 1980s, however, official historians claimed that Stephen was literally a \"lord of all Romanians\".{{sfn|Boia|2001|pp=140, 222, 249-250}} Iorga's book has been republished several times, including on the 500th anniversary of Stephen's death.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|pp=88-89}} On the same anniversary, Stephen was presented as a symbol of \"national identity, independence and inter-ethnic harmony\" in the [[Republic of Moldova]],{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=89}} where he also endures as the symbol of \"Moldavian particularism\"{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=140}} or \"Moldovan patriotism\".{{sfn|Cojocari|2007|p=93}} Thus, Stephen was invoked by both the [[Popular Front of Moldova]], which favored Romanian identity, and the Moldovenist [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|Party of Communists]].{{sfn|Cojocari|2007|pp=90-97, 100-102}} The latter describes Stephen as \"the founder of Moldavian statehood\", claiming direct continuity from his principality to the present-day state.{{sfn|Cojocari|2007|pp=101-104}}\n\nAs Eagles notes, \"Stephen is an ever-present icon\" in both Romania and Moldova: \"statues of his image abound; politicians cite him as an exemplar; schools and [[\u0218tefan cel Mare University of Suceava|a university bear his name]]; villages and the main thoroughfares of towns and cities are named after him; there is a [[\u0218tefan cel Mare metro station]] in central Bucharest; and his crowned head has adorned ''every'' banknote in the [[Post-Soviet states|post-Soviet]] Moldovan republic\".{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=1}} According to a 1999 [[opinion poll]], more than 13% of the participants regarded Stephen the Great as the most important personality who had \"influenced the destiny of the Romanians for the better\".{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=17}} Seven years later, during a programme called the ''[[100 Greatest Romanians]]'' on [[Romanian Television]], he was voted \"the greatest Romanian of all time\".{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=83}}\n\n=== Holy ruler ===\n{{Infobox saint\n|name= Saint Stephen the Great\n|image=Tablou votiv Manastirea Dobrovat 1503.jpg\n|caption=Votive depiction of Stephen at [[Dobrov\u0103\u021b Monastery]]\n|feast_day=July 2\n|venerated_in= [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]\n|titles= Holy Voivode\n|canonized_date=July 12, 1992\n|canonized_place=[[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]\n|canonized_by=[[Romanian Orthodox Church]]\n|major_shrine=[[Putna Monastery]]\n|suppressed_date=\n|issues=\n}}\n\nIn [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] legends, Romanian stories, and Moldavian chronicles alike, Stephen's victories against the Ottomans and Hungarians were already regarded as God-inspired, or as placed under the direct patronage of various saints ([[Saint George|George]], [[Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Demetrius]], [[Procopius of Scythopolis|Procopius]], or [[Saint Mercurius|Mercurius]]).{{sfn|Cristea|2016|pp=316-340}}{{sfn|Schipor|2004|p=206}} Worship of Stephen himself was first recorded in the 1570s,{{sfn|Simon|2009|p=233}} but, according to Ureche, he had been regarded as a saint soon after his funeral: \"not on account of his soul ... for he was a man with sins ... but on account of the great deeds he accomplished\".{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=77}} The positive nuances of Ureche's report were also repeated by [[Miron Costin]].{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=77}} \n\nThe abbot of Putna Monastery, Artimon Bortnic, initiated the investigation of the tomb room of the monastery in 1851, referring to important shrines in Russia and Moldavia.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=110}} In 1857 (a year after Stephen's tomb was opened), the priest and journalist Iraclie Porumbescu already wrote of the \"holy bones of Putna\".{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=93}} In at least some legends attested by 1903, the voivode is depicted as an immortal [[King asleep in mountain|sleeping hero]], or, alternatively, as the ruler of heaven.{{sfn|Schipor|2004|p=202}} However, Stephen the Great was ignored when the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] canonized the first Romanian saints in the 1950s.{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=73}}\n\n[[Teoctist Ar\u0103pa\u0219u|Teoctist]], [[Patriarch of All Romania]], canonized Stephen along with 12 other saints at [[Saint Spyridon the New Church]] in Bucharest on 21 June 1992.{{sfn|Ramet|1998|p=195}} On this occasion, the patriarch emphasized that Stephen had been a defender of Christianity and protector of his people.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=78}} He also underlined that Stephen had built churches during his reign.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=78}} Stephen's feast day is July 2 (the day of his death) in the calendar of the Romanian Orthodox Church. On his first feast after his canonization, a new ceremony was held to celebrate Stephen the Great and Saint in Putna.{{sfn|Ramet|1998|p=195}} 15,000 people (including the [[President of Romania]] at the time, [[Ion Iliescu]], and two ministers) attended the event.{{sfn|Ramet|1998|p=196}} Patriarch Teoctist noted that \"God has brought us together under the same skies, just as Stephen rallied us under the same flag in the past.\"{{sfn|Ramet|1998|p=196}}\n\n==Arms==\nStephen's rule consolidated the usage of the [[coat of arms of Moldavia]], featuring the [[aurochs]] head (first attested in 1387), sometimes as a [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] atop his personal arms. He revived the elaborate design introduced under [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander the Good]], which also featured a [[Rose (heraldry)|rose]], [[crescent]], [[Sun (heraldry)|sun]] and star (often, but not always, [[Five-pointed star|five-pointed]]); its [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]] remain unknown.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=83-85, 98-120}} This arrangement was not familiar to heraldists in Western Europe. By the 1530s, they represented Moldavia with [[attributed arms]] featuring [[Maure]]s; these arms, though originally used for Wallachia, possibly echoed Stephen's victories over the Ottomans.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=77-81, 126}}\n\nThe personal arms and [[heraldic flag]]s used by Stephen have been the topic of additional scrutiny and debate. Stephen is known to have used a ''[[Division of the field|party per cross]]'' shield with one striped quarter, but the colors are uncertain: one prevailing interpretation is that the dominant tinctures were [[Or (heraldry)|or]] and [[Vert (heraldry)|vert]], although they may also have been [[gules]] and [[argent]]. These may derive from the colors used by the [[House of Basarab]] (which were possibly used by Stephen's in-law [[Radu the Fair]]), from the [[coat of arms of Hungary]], or from a purely Moldavian tradition.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=67-68, 107, 110}} The division and the striped pattern are possibly Hungarian; they survived in some of Stephen's seals even during his dispute with the Hungarian crown. He also continued to use the ''[[fleur-de-lis]]'', an [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] symbol, but altered it into a \"double-headed lily\", then renounced it altogether.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=109, 111-112, 119-120}} Similarly, he used the [[Cross of Lorraine]], [[Cross patt\u00e9e|patt\u00e9e]], possibly in reference to the [[Pahonia]]. Following his 1489 dispute with Poland, that charge was altered into a double [[cross fleury]].{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=118, 119}} \n\nStephen's heraldic symbols progressively merged with those attributed to the [[House of Mu\u0219at]], and were intensively used by all princes who claimed full or partial descent from Alexander the Good\u2014including [[Peter the Lame]], a Wallachian pretender to Moldavia's throne.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=96, 99-100, 102-108, 111-120}} The Putna tombstones of Stephen's two sons who died during his lifetime, Bogdan and Peter, already display the aurochs within the \"Mu\u0219at coat-of-arms\".{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=98-99}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|pp=102-103}} \n\nA Moldavian banner also survives in hand-colored versions illustrating [[Johannes de Thurocz]]'s ''[[Chronica Hungarorum]]'', with varying tinctures. These were first identified as Stephen's flags by [[Constantin Karadja]], and described by later authors as a version of the or-an-vert scheme in the coat of arms.{{sfn|Tiron|2012|pp=71-75}} Other clues suggest that the field was a solid one of or, charged with an aurochs of or, but also that the preferred \"single Moldavian\" color was gules.{{sfn|Tiron|2012|pp=76-80}} Gules is also the color of Stephen's alleged [[war flag]], defaced with an icon of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] and donated by the prince himself to [[Zograf monastery]].

Japan has a national holiday called [[Respect for the Aged Day]], but for many people it is merely another holiday. Buses and trains carry signs above especially reserved seats to remind people to give up their seats for elderly riders. Many older Japanese continued to live full lives that included gainful employment and close relationships with adult children.\n\nAlthough the standard [[retirement]] age in Japan throughout most of the postwar period was 55, people aged 65 and over in Japan were more likely to work than in any other developed country in the 1980s. In 1987 about 36% of men and 15% of women in this age-group were in the [[labor force]]. With better [[pension]] benefits and decreased opportunities for agricultural or other self-employed work, however, labor force participation by the elderly has been decreasing since 1960. In 1986 about 90% of Japanese surveyed said that they wished to continue working after age 65. They indicated both financial and health reasons for this choice. Other factors, such as a strong [[work ethic]] and the centering of men's social ties around the workplace, may also be relevant. Employment was not always available, however, and men and women who worked after retirement usually took substantial cuts in salary and prestige. Between 1981 and 1986, the proportion of people 60 and over who reported that a public pension was their major source of income increased from 35% to 53%, while those relying most on earnings for income fell from 31 to 25% and those relying on children decreased from 16 to 9%.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, there has been a trend toward a nuclear family instead of a three-generation household that leaves the elderly, who are accustomed to different values and who expected to live with their son\u2019s family during old age, by themselves.<ref name=\"Inger2014\">{{cite journal |last1=Inger |first1=Maleen B. |title=Aging in Urban Japan - Intergenerational Reading in Tokyo |journal=Working with Older People |date=2014 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=24\u201329 |doi=10.1108/WWOP-10-2013-0026 }}</ref> The proportion living with children decreased from 77% in 1970 to 65% in 1985, although this rate was still much higher than in other [[industrialized]] countries.

People living alone or only with spouses constituted 32% of the 65-and-over group. Less than half of those responding to a government survey believed that it was the duty of the eldest son to care for parents, but 63% replied that it was natural for children to take care of their elderly parents.

This project was started by a research team for Social Participation and Health Promotion of Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology (TMIG), and later was sponsored by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labor. The team was motivated to bring \u201cactive participation in society by senior citizens\u201d in Tokyo, while studying \u201chow intergenerational exchange between senior volunteers and children affect each other and what outcome it produces\u201d (Research of Productivity by Intergenerational Sympathy, 2013). After completion of three-week training workshop, volunteers visited public elementary schools and kindergartens and sometimes even senior high schools depending on demand for picture book reading sessions. The elders can decide the appropriate type of book for the respective age group they are going to read to, or sometimes, they can read old stories such as ancient Japanese myths or legends they enjoyed during their childhood. This encourages the older generations to pursue intellectual activities while transferring wisdom and contributing to the growth of the younger generations. Although the REPRINTS network relies heavily on demand of the schools and the initiative of the volunteers, the experience created has major impacts on both the young generation and the elderly themselves. While the students are having a refreshing change to their ordinary school day with exciting cultural stories, beneficial improvements in health were found among elders who volunteered intensively. Overall, the REPRINTS network has intergenerational activities that can be easily adopted and introduced to other communities while including senior citizens, helping them stay active and useful for the community.<ref name=\"Kingston2011p43\" />\n\nThis type of voluntary program can be a possible answer to promote society involvement, life fulfillment and healthy activities for the elderly population of Japan.\n\nAlso various robots have been developed to cater for increasing number of elderly persons. Examples include robots designed to elicit emotional responses or enhance communication such as robots [[Paro (robot)|Paro]] or [[Pepper (robot)|Pepper]] as well as physical assistant robots, mobile servant robots, and person carrier robots. Those robots that are specifically designed to assist elderly people are also known as carebots, and their development has been heavily funded by the Japanese government.<ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/japan-developing-carebots-for-elderly-care-2015-11 Japan is running out of people to take care of the elderly, so it's making robots instead], Business Insider, 20 November 2015</ref>\n\n==Aging and retirement of the labor force==\nAs Japan's population aged, so did its [[workforce]]. In 1990 about 20% of the work force was made up of workers aged 55 and over. The [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Labor]] predicted that by 2000 about 24% of the working population (almost one in four workers) would be in this age-group. This demographic shift brings about both [[macroeconomic]] and [[microeconomic]] problems. At the national level, Japan is having  financing the [[pension system]], and the future of the pension system was a major topic in the [[2005 Japan general election|2005 House of Representatives election]]. At the corporate level, problems include growing personnel costs and the shortage of senior positions.\n\nIn most Japanese companies, salaries rise with worker age. Because younger workers are paid less, they are more attractive to employers, and the difficulty in finding employment increases with age. This pattern is evidenced by the [[unemployment rate]]s for different age-groups and by the number of applicants per job vacancy for each age-group in openings handled by public employment offices. As the Japanese population ages, such trends may grow.\n\nMost Japanese companies require that employees retire upon reaching a specified age. During most of the postwar period, that age was 55. Because government social security payments normally begin at age 60, workers are forced to find reemployment to fill the five-year gap. However, in 1986 the [[Japanese Diet]] passed a law to provide various incentives for firms to raise their retirement age to 60. Many Japanese companies raised the retirement age they had set, partly in response to this legislation. And despite mandatory retirement policies, many Japanese companies allow their employees to continue working beyond the age of 60, although generally at reduced wages. People over 60 continue to work for varied reasons: to supplement inadequate pension incomes, to give meaning to their lives, or to keep in touch with society. Some companies, specifically small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) have incorporated various adaptations such as making workplaces barrier free, reallocating work tasks, and establishing \"elderly-oriented \u2018improvement systems\u2019\" [[kaizen]] in order \"to ensure the motivation and performance of elderly workers through various adaptations of their work content and environment\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Prolonging working life in Japan: Issues and practices for elderly employment in an aging society|journal=Contemporary Japan |date=2018 |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages = 227\u2013242|doi = 10.1080/18692729.2018.1504530|last1 = Martine|first1 = Julien|last2 = Jaussaud|first2 = Jacques}}</ref>\n\nAs Japan's population ages, the financial health of the public [[pension]] plan deteriorates. To avoid massive increases in premiums, the government reformed the system in 1986 by cutting benefit levels and raising the plan's specified age at which benefits began from 60 to 65. Under the revised system, contributions paid in equal share by employer and employee were expected to be equivalent to about 30% of wages, as opposed to 40% of wages under the old system. However, problems then arose in securing employment opportunities for the 60-to-65 age group.\n\nIn 1990 some 90% of companies paid retirement benefits to their employees in the form of lump-sum payments and pensions. Some companies based the payment amount on the employee's base pay, while others used formulas independent of base pay. Because the system was designed to reward long service, payment rose progressively with the number of years worked.\n\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aging of Japan]]\n*[[Respect for the Aged Day]]\n*[[Demographics of Japan]]\n*[[Ubasute]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{loc}} - [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/jptoc.html Japan]\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal|author=Yamauchi, Kanako<!--Yamauchi is the family name-->|author2=Isao Saito<!--Saito is the family name-->|author3=Tadahiro Kato<!--Kato is the family name-->|url=http://www.ed.ehime-u.ac.jp/~kiyou/2018/pdf/19.pdf|title=Depression in the elderly in rural areas of Japan and its impact on activities of daily living: a longitudinal survey over 10 years|publisher=[[Ehime University]]|work=Bulletin of the Faculty of Education<!--Japanese name: \u611b\u5a9b\u5927\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u90e8\u7d00\u8981 - English name from https://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/AA11987685 -->|date=2018-06-21|volume=65|pages=191-197}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=131 Another Tsunami Warning: Caring for Japan's Elderly] (NBR Expert Brief, April 2011)\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elderly People In Japan}}\n[[Category:Japanese society]]\n[[Category:Demographics of Japan]]\n[[Category:Old age in Japan]]\n", "text_old": "This article focuses on the situation of '''elderly people in Japan''' and the recent changes in society.\n\n[[Japan]]'s [[Aging of Japan|population is aging]].

This demographic shift brings about both [[macroeconomic]] and [[microeconomic]] problems. At the national level, Japan is having  financing the [[pension system]], and the future of the pension system was a major topic in the [[2005 Japan general election|2005 House of Representatives election]]. At the corporate level, problems include growing personnel costs and the shortage of senior positions.\n\nIn most Japanese companies, salaries rise with worker age. Because younger workers are paid less, they are more attractive to employers, and the difficulty in finding employment increases with age. This pattern is evidenced by the [[unemployment rate]]s for different age-groups and by the number of applicants per job vacancy for each age-group in openings handled by public employment offices. As the Japanese population ages, such trends may grow.\n\nMost Japanese companies require that employees retire upon reaching a specified age. During most of the postwar period, that age was 55. Because government social security payments normally begin at age 60, workers are forced to find reemployment to fill the five-year gap. However, in 1986 the [[Japanese Diet]] passed a law to provide various incentives for firms to raise their retirement age to 60. Many Japanese companies raised the retirement age they had set, partly in response to this legislation. And despite mandatory retirement policies, many Japanese companies allow their employees to continue working beyond the age of 60, although generally at reduced wages. People over 60 continue to work for varied reasons: to supplement inadequate pension incomes, to give meaning to their lives, or to keep in touch with society. Some companies, specifically small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) have incorporated various adaptations such as making workplaces barrier free, reallocating work tasks, and establishing \"elderly-oriented \u2018improvement systems\u2019\" [[kaizen]] in order \"to ensure the motivation and performance of elderly workers through various adaptations of their work content and environment\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Prolonging working life in Japan: Issues and practices for elderly employment in an aging society|journal=Contemporary Japan |date=2018 |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages = 227\u2013242|doi = 10.1080/18692729.2018.1504530|last1 = Martine|first1 = Julien|last2 = Jaussaud|first2 = Jacques}}</ref>\n\nAs Japan's population ages, the financial health of the public [[pension]] plan deteriorates. To avoid massive increases in premiums, the government reformed the system in 1986 by cutting benefit levels and raising the plan's specified age at which benefits began from 60 to 65. Under the revised system, contributions paid in equal share by employer and employee were expected to be equivalent to about 30% of wages, as opposed to 40% of wages under the old system. However, problems then arose in securing employment opportunities for the 60-to-65 age group.\n\nIn 1990 some 90% of companies paid retirement benefits to their employees in the form of lump-sum payments and pensions. Some companies based the payment amount on the employee's base pay, while others used formulas independent of base pay. Because the system was designed to reward long service, payment rose progressively with the number of years worked.\n\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aging of Japan]]\n*[[Respect for the Aged Day]]\n*[[Demographics of Japan]]\n*[[Ubasute]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{loc}} - [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/jptoc.html Japan]\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal|author=Yamauchi, Kanako<!--Yamauchi is the family name-->|author2=Isao Saito<!--Saito is the family name-->|author3=Tadahiro Kato<!--Kato is the family name-->|url=http://www.ed.ehime-u.ac.jp/~kiyou/2018/pdf/19.pdf|title=Depression in the elderly in rural areas of Japan and its impact on activities of daily living: a longitudinal survey over 10 years|publisher=[[Ehime University]]|work=Bulletin of the Faculty of Education<!--Japanese name: \u611b\u5a9b\u5927\u5b66\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u90e8\u7d00\u8981 - English name from https://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/AA11987685 -->|date=2018-06-21|volume=65|pages=191-197}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=131 Another Tsunami Warning: Caring for Japan's Elderly] (NBR Expert Brief, April 2011)\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elderly People In Japan}}\n[[Category:Japanese society]]\n[[Category:Demographics of Japan]]\n[[Category:Old age in Japan]]\n", "name_user": "JusticeForNamek445", "label": "safe", "comment": "Made it more legible for the elderly :)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elderly_people_in_Japan"}

In each game mode, teams work together to achieve a victory condition, typically destroying the core building (called the Nexus) in the enemy team's base after bypassing a line of defensive structures called turrets, or towers.\n\nIn all game modes, players control characters called champions, chosen or assigned every match, who each have a set of unique abilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/ |title=Champions : League of Legends |publisher=[[Riot Games]] |accessdate=February 25, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228160823/http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/ |archivedate=February 28, 2014 }}</ref> Champions begin every match at a low [[Experience point|level]],<!-- Not always level 1.--> and then gain experience over the course of the match to achieve a maximum level of 18. Gaining champion levels in matches allows players to unlock their champion's special abilities and augment them in a number of ways unique to each character. If a champion loses all their health, they are defeated but are automatically revived in their base after enough time passes. Players also begin each match with a low amount of gold, and can earn additional gold throughout the match in a variety of ways: by killing non-player characters known as minions and monsters; by killing or helping to kill enemy players; by destroying enemy structures; passively over time; and through unique item interactions or champion abilities. This gold can then be spent throughout the match to buy in-game items that further augment each champion's abilities and gameplay in a variety of ways. Champion experience, gold earned, and items bought are specific to each match and do not carry over to subsequent matches. Thus, all players begin each match on a more-or-less equal footing relative to their opposing team.\n\nAcross matches, players also earn rewards that are applied to their account. Player accounts begin at level one and progress onward with games played. Player level is separate from character level; both a level 30 account and a level 5 account would begin at character level 1 at the start of a new game. From 2009\u20132017, the maximum account level was 30, and as players progressed, they unlocked additional content and abilities. This system was reworked in November 2017, with the removal of the level 30 limit and removal of a Runes / Masteries system that gave in-game bonuses to players based on their account level.<ref>[https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/09/upcoming-changes-to-leveling-ip-rewards/ Upcoming Changes To Leveling, IP, & Rewards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107021307/https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/09/upcoming-changes-to-leveling-ip-rewards/ |date=November 7, 2017}}.

In the past, two other maps were featured as well, although they have since been discontinued.  Each map has different terrain, objectives as well as varied summoner spells and items.\n\n====Summoner's Rift====\n[[File:Map of MOBA.svg|thumb|240px|A simplified representation of Summoner's Rift. The yellow paths are the \"lanes\" where endless waves of troops known as minions march; blue and red dots are the defensive turrets that defend the lanes. Not pictured are the two turrets that flank each Nexus \u2013 the ultimate goal of the game, which are within each team's base in their corner. The dotted black line is the river that divides the sides.]]\n\nSummoner's Rift is the most popular map in ''League of Legends''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> On this map type, two teams of five players compete to destroy an enemy building called a Nexus, which is guarded by the enemy team and a number of defensive structures called turrets, or towers.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web |url=http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/summoners-rift/ |title=Summoner's Rift |work=leagueoflegends.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905055218/http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/summoners-rift/ |archivedate=September 5, 2015 }}</ref> One nexus is located in each enemy base on opposite sides of the map, in the lower-left and upper-right hand corners. These structures continually create weak non-player characters known as minions, which advance toward the enemy base along three paths: top, middle, and bottom lanes. Players compete to advance these waves of minions into the enemy base, which allows them to destroy enemy structures and ultimately win the match. Between lanes are neutral areas of the map known as the 'jungle', arrayed in four quadrants. A shallow river divides the map between the teams, but doesn't actually impede movement; all champions can wade through it no differently than dry land.\n\nEach team wishes to defend its own structures and destroy the other team's structures. These include:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boosteria.org/guides/league-legends-objectives-guide |title=League of Legends Objectives guide: Priority and Timers |work=boosteria.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305005126/https://boosteria.org/guides/league-legends-objectives-guide |archivedate=March 5, 2016 }}</ref>\n* Turrets \u2013 Each lane is guarded by powerful defensive structures called turrets. Turrets deal exceptionally high damage and will attack enemy minions and players that approach them. Turrets prioritize enemy minions in their vicinity, but will immediately attack enemy players if they attack allied players. Thus, by advancing an allied minion wave into the range of a turret, a player can do damage to the structure without themselves being attacked. When destroyed, turrets provide gold and experience. Turrets that are destroyed are destroyed permanently for that match and will not respawn. Some turrets, depending on location, will regenerate health over time if they are damaged but not destroyed.\n* Inhibitor \u2013 Each lane contains one inhibitor. A lane's inhibitor can be attacked after a team has destroyed the three turrets guarding its lane. Destroying an inhibitor will cause the allied Nexus to spawn Super Minions, more powerful Minions that provide a buff to surrounding Minions. If destroyed, inhibitors will respawn after five minutes.\n* Nexus \u2013 Each team has a Nexus that can only be damaged once all the turrets in a lane, that lane's inhibitor and the Nexus turrets are destroyed. Destruction of the enemy team's Nexus ends the game.\n\nSome objectives are 'neutral', meaning that they will not attack champions who pass by, but champions can choose to fight them if they wish to gain a reward at the cost of having to fight for it. They include:\n* Jungle monsters \u2013 Neutral monsters spawn at various intervals in the Jungle, and provides players with gold, experience, and sometimes other rewards for killing them. They are the most common neutral objective.<!-- Please do not add details about red buff and blue buff and their bonuses and transferring them. General overview, not specific.  -->\n* Elemental Drakes/Elder Dragon \u2013 Elemental drakes are powerful monsters located in the bottom half of the river. All members of the team that kills the drake are provided with buffs that last the entire game and accrue cumulatively. The drakes are flavored after the [[Classical element|Four Elements]], with each drake granting a thematically appropriate buff.  After a rework in 2019, three random different elemental drakes will spawn, with new ones coming six minutes after the previous one is killed.  After the third drake, all future drakes will be of that elemental type; once a team has slain 4 dragons, they get a \"Dragon Soul\" buff, and future dragon spawns are The Elder Dragon, which when killed provides a stronger buff than an individual elemental drake.\n* Rift Herald \u2013 The Rift Herald is a powerful enemy located in the upper side of the River. Killing the Rift Herald allows it to be summoned again as a battering ram to attack enemy towers.  From 2016&ndash;2019, it would not respawn after it is killed; after a rework in November 2019, it can potentially respawn once.<ref name=\"rift_herald2017\">[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/midseason-2017 Rift Herald] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706153609/http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/midseason-2017 |date=July 6, 2017}}</ref>\n* Baron Nashor \u2013 Baron Nashor is the most powerful neutral enemy, located in the upper side of the River. It will spawn after twenty minutes, replacing the Rift Herald. All living members of the team that kills Baron Nashor are given a buff which makes nearby minions more powerful. Baron Nashor will respawn seven minutes after it is killed.\n\nMany of the details have changed over time; ''League'' is not a static game, with mechanics being both introduced and removed since launch in 2009. For example, the Rift Herald was only added in 2016, and had its abilities reworked in 2017 and in late 2019;<ref>[https://na.leagueoflegends.com/na/site/2016-season-update/preseason.html 2016 Season Update] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107020148/https://na.leagueoflegends.com/na/site/2016-season-update/preseason.html |date=November 7, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"rift_herald2017\" /> Dragons gave gold rather than buffs from 2009\u20132014, and the dragons only became elementally flavored drakes in 2016; jungle monsters have been added and reworked; the length of time it took for inhibitors to respawn was 4 minutes rather than 5 minutes for a time; Baron Nashor gave a stronger buff to the statistics of champions but no buff to minions from 2009\u20132014; and so on.\n\n====Howling Abyss====\nThe Howling Abyss is used for \"ARAM\" (All Random All Mid) matches, and is five vs. five.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> The difference between the Abyss and the other maps is that there is only a single narrow lane of turrets and an inhibitor and no neutral jungle area. Thus, rather than skirmishes and hidden movement, the Abyss focuses exclusively on large team-fights in the sole middle lane. Players cannot return to their allied base to replenish health and mana or purchase items unless they have been killed.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> ARAM was launched as an official mode in September 2013.<ref name=\"escapistARAM\">[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/7.406935-League-Of-Legends-All-Random-All-Mid-Mode-Gets-Official League Of Legends' \"All Random All Mid\" Mode Gets Official] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629142319/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/7.406935-League-Of-Legends-All-Random-All-Mid-Mode-Gets-Official |date=June 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Twisted Treeline====\nIn the Twisted Treeline, two teams of three players compete to destroy the opposing team's Nexus, which is guarded enemy Towers.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web |url=http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/the-twisted-treeline/ |title=The Twisted Treeline |work=leagueoflegends.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702044249/http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/the-twisted-treeline/ |archivedate=July 2, 2015 }}</ref> It is conceptually similar to Summoner's Rift, but smaller to account for three vs. three rather than five vs. five.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Rather than Summoner's Rift 3 lanes of turrets and 3 inhibitors, Twisted Treeline has only 2 lanes and 2 inhibitors, with the jungle in between. The other differences are the addition of two \"Altars\", control of which grants the occupying team a variety of bonuses, and the replacement of Baron Nashor with Vilemaw, an evil spider deity. Living members of the team that slays Vilemaw are granted a temporary bonus, similar to the one granted by Baron Nashor.  Riot Games retired the mode in November 2019, due to declining playership.<ref>[https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/league-of-legends-twisted-treeline-will-be-retired-later-this-year League of Legends' Twisted Treeline will be retired later this year]</ref><ref name=\"tt-goodbye\" />\n\n====Crystal Scar====\nThe Crystal Scar was used for Dominion mode, a discontinued game format where teams of five players competed to capture control points and hold those points for the longest possible period of time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/the-crystal-scar |title=The Crystal Scar |work=leagueoflegends.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125153342/http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/the-crystal-scar/ |archivedate=January 25, 2014 }}</ref> The map consists of a circle with 5 control points. Each team controls a base known as a fountain, located at the bottom left and right-hand corners of the map. Each team scores points by capturing and owning more objectives than the other team over time, which is then reduced from the other team's \"life\" total. These points count down from an initial score of 200. The first team to reduce the other team to 0 points wins. Dominion was launched on September 26, 2011 and was retired on February 22, 2016, although the Crystal Scar is used for certain other rotating formats, such as Ascension.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-dominion-mode-launches/1100-6336613/ League of Legends: Dominion mode launches] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822014211/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-dominion-mode-launches/1100-6336613/ |date=August 22, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/retiring-dominion |title=Retiring Dominion |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316081135/http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/retiring-dominion |archivedate=March 16, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Games types===\n''League of Legends'' includes several game types players can select.<ref name=\"gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide |title=Matchmaking Guide |work=Riot Games Support |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906181359/https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide |archivedate=September 6, 2015 |access-date=September 18, 2015 }}</ref>\n* The Tutorial is the first game type available to new players. The tutorial is played on the Howling Abyss and is intended to teach new players the rules and gameplay of ''League''.\n* Co-op Vs. AI is available to new players after completing or opting out of the Tutorial. It is played on Summoner's Rift, Twisted Treeline, and (formerly) the Crystal Scar, and pits teams of human players against an opposing team of computer-controlled artificial intelligence champions.\n* Normal Matchmaking uses an automated matchmaking system to pair teams of similarly-skilled players against one another.\n* Ranked Matchmaking is available to players upon reaching account level 30. It uses a similar system as Normal Matchmaking; however, pre-made teams must be of comparable ELO strength, so expert players and weak players are not allowed to team together in Ranked. After playing 8 or more Ranked games, accounts are given a public \"rank\" that roughly correlates with their ELO ranking.\n* Custom Games allow players to play any map with any combination of player or AI teammates and opponents.\n\n''League of Legends'' also includes three ways teams may choose what champion they will play for a given match:\n* Blind Pick allows the two teams to select their champions simultaneously. The players only learn the champion selections of the opposing team when the match begins. It is available on Summoner's Rift, Twisted Treeline, and the Crystal Scar for Normal Matchmaking games and Co-op vs. AI, and for all modes in custom games.\n* Draft Pick allows each team to ban five champions each (a total of ten champions banned), removing them from the match. Teams then take turns selecting their champions while being able to see the selections of the other team. It is available on Summoner's Rift for matchmaking games, and for all modes in custom games.\n* Random Pick randomly assigns a champion to each player. Players accumulate re-rolls by playing multiple matches, which they can use to randomly select another champion for that match. It is available on Howling Abyss for ARAM (All Random All Mid) games, and for all modes in custom games.\n\n=== Champion types ===\nThere are currently 148 champions in ''League of Legends'' as of January 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/|title=Champions {{!}} League of Legends|website=na.leagueoflegends.com|access-date=2020-01-11}}</ref> ''League'' divides its champion types up a number of ways. The most salient difference is the type of damage a champion deals; some champions deal largely physical damage, which is resisted by the armor stat, and other champions deal largely magic damage, which is resisted by the magic resistance stat. Some champions deal with a combination of both and can choose which to emphasize; some rare abilities deal 'true' damage which is not mitigable by either armor or magic resistance. Riot Games has classified all champions as one of six types to aid beginners. Not all champions perfectly fit their type, of course. The official Riot classifications are as follows:\n* [[Glossary_of_video_game_terms#Damage_per_second|Marksman]]: Marksmen, also known as \"AD (attack damage) Carries\", are ranged champions that usually deal physical damage. These champions deal sustained damage over time rather than in a short burst, and are usually the best at destroying objectives like enemy turrets or elemental drakes. They tend to have weak defense in exchange for their high, exponentially scaling damage.\n* Mage: Mages, sometimes known as \"AP (ability power) Carries\", are champions with powerful magic damage and control skills, but weak defense and low mobility. Mages are a diverse set of champions. Some emphasize killing single champions from range very quickly; some specialize in area of effect damage to multiple targets whilst surviving in the middle of a fight; some specialize in immense range to attack enemies safely from afar. Some others blend up to two of these attributes. \n* Slayer: A champion who specializes in killing another champion quickly, most usually within melee range. These champions tend to go after the enemy's AD/AP Carry and other 'squishy' champions, but tend to have weak defenses themselves if caught. They are distinguished by having excellent mobility which allows them to reach and strike at priority targets. Slayers are divided between ''Assassins'' that flank and infiltrate enemies to select one target for death before escaping, and ''Skirmishers'' that rely more on strong sustained damage like a Marksman and unique defensive tools to remain in the fray.\n* [[Tank (gaming)|Tank]]: Champions who are hard to kill and soak up damage for their team. In exchange, they usually deal less damage but can compensate with useful \"crowd control\" abilities to distract or disable enemies or force enemies to fight through them first before they can attack the \"carries\". Tanks are divided between ''Vanguards'' that lead the charge into fights by disabling multiple enemies at once, and ''Wardens'' that are more concerned with protecting their own allies from enemy attacks.\n* Fighter: Champions that blend the attributes of a damage dealer and tank, combining moderate survivability with respectable damage. A common designation for close-range melee fighters, since they need to be able to survive long enough to close in on their target. There are two types of Fighters: ''Juggernauts'' that are largely immobile but have more extreme damage and survivability, and ''Divers'' that have more robust target selection at the cost of some survivability. \n* Controller: Champions whose skills are meant to directly aid the rest of the team by providing healing, buffing allies, debuffing the enemy team, disabling single targets, or a combination of the above. Typically referred to as \"support\" champions, controllers are often paired with another champion in the early laning phase of the game and focus on aiding their partner and harassing enemy champions rather than earning gold by slaying minions. Many different types of champions can serve as the \"support\", but tanks, healers, and certain types of mages are most common. Supports are expected to pay the most attention to the map as a whole, placing wards which grant vision and watching for surprise enemy movements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/3A5uuBw7-champion-subclass-list|title=Champion Subclass List|author=James \"Stattik\" Bach|date=January 2015}}</ref>\n\nItem choice plays an important role in the above and can shift the style of a champion. For example, if the champion Jarvan IV purchases all damage items, he functions something like an Assassin; he can kill enemies quickly but dies rapidly himself. If Jarvan buys all defensive items, he's a Tank focused on disruption and buffing his allies. Somewhere in-between, he's a Fighter. In the same way, champions like Morgana or and Lux can build item sets that are focused on high damage like a Mage, or item sets focused on disrupting enemies and aiding allies like a Controller. A handful of champions in the game offer unique playstyles that do not fit neatly into any particular class.\n\n=== Featured game modes ===\nRiot Games, starting in 2013, has released a number of special limited-time game modes.

RP can be used to purchase champions, champion skins, ward skins, summoner icons, emotes, and certain multi-game boosts. An additional currency, Blue Essence (BE) (known as Influence Points from 2009\u20132017), is earned by playing the game and leveling up. ''League of Legends'' is free-to-play and all in-game purchases with a material effect on game-play may be acquired by either RP or BE. The final currency, Orange Essence (OE), can be used to unlock champion skins, ward skins, summoner icons, and emotes via the \"Hextech Crafting\".\n\n==Setting and lore==\n''League of Legends'' takes place in the fictional world of Runeterra. In Runeterra, the champions of ''League of Legends'' are a collection of heroes and villains who have a variety of backstories, often related to the political struggles of the various countries of the main continent of Valoran. Additionally, some champions are extraplanar and come from worlds other than Runeterra, but are visiting for their own purposes. These champions sometimes clash with each other, roughly reflected in the gameplay of ''League of Legends''.\n\nThe setting has gone through two phases: the \"original\" setting that was canon from 2009\u20132014, and the rebooted setting from 2014\u2013present.<ref name=\"exploringruneterra\">{{cite web |url=http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/dev-blog-exploring-runeterra |title=Dev Blog: Exploring Runeterra |last=Gnox |first=Tommy |date=September 4, 2014 |publisher=Riot Games |access-date=December 3, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206170736/http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/dev-blog-exploring-runeterra/ |archivedate=December 6, 2016 }}</ref> The original setting was very focused on justifying the exact mechanics of a game of ''League'' in the world of Runeterra. The MOBA predecessor to ''League'', ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'', featured two warring sides with two separate hero rosters; however, in ''League'', any combination of champions was legal to create a team. To explain this, in the original setting, Valoran was functionally ruled by extremely powerful time mages who could intimidate the other nations into compliance with their whims. They created the \"Institute of War\", also known as the \"League of Legends\", to resolve disputes and act as something like an international sports league. In these disputes, \"Summoners\" (a.k.a. the game player) could control any of Runeterra's greatest heroes or villains in their struggles, thus justifying why a team of 5 characters who all hated each other might form. Additionally, these time mages would actually power-down the characters to \"level 1\" before each match to make things 'fair'; some character's backstories even involved them explicitly having their powers sealed by the Institute of War due to them being too powerful otherwise, such as the demigoddesses Kayle and Morgana. This explained why characters might participate in multiple matches and have to relearn the same skills each time. After a match, a \"Judgment\" would sometimes be handed down, with the winning Summoners able to give land and privileges to those they favored.\n\nThe narrative team at Riot eventually decided this setup was too constraining, and \"rebooted\" the story behind ''League of Legends'' in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-just-destroyed-its-lore-will-start-o-1630783950 |title=League Of Legends Just Destroyed Its Lore, Will Start Over |last=Plunkett |first=Luke |date=September 4, 2014 |website=Kotaku |access-date=December 3, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216134356/http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-just-destroyed-its-lore-will-start-o-1630783950 |archivedate=December 16, 2016 }}</ref> In essence, the original story put too much emphasis on the faceless player stand-in Summoners and the Time Mages of the Institute; \"the very idea of all-powerful Summoners made Champions little more than puppets manipulated by godlike powers.\"<ref name=\"exploringruneterra\" /> Any interesting champions the Narrative team created were rendered as secondary, mere servants to the Summoners, unable to influence their own destiny. Many champion's lore did not give them reason to join the Institute, such as serial killer fire spirit Brand or void monster Rek'Sai. Riot wished to let champions take the center stage and have stories of their own, pursuing their own unique goals. For example, Riot has since released a plotline about a lost empire in the Shurima desert<ref>[http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-takes-its-new-lore-for-a-test-drive-1633297077 http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-takes-its-new-lore-for-a-test-drive-1633297077] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220041007/http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-takes-its-new-lore-for-a-test-drive-1633297077 |date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> and a plotline about a clash between the pirate Gangplank and the pirate-hunter Miss Fortune in the city of Bilgewater,<ref>[http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-just-killed-off-a-champion-1720995935 League Of Legends Just Killed Off A Champion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220043825/http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-just-killed-off-a-champion-1720995935 |date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> both of which were driven by the champions of League of Legends, not Summoners.

However, the game's confusing launch was criticized: it was felt that the title was released too early, with some features missing and others to be removed. Finally, the reviewer noted that high level players in the game have \"little patience for newcomers\", though the reviewer believed that matchmaking (not implemented at the time of review) would solve the problem by matching players of similar level together.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/104/1042996p1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110061331/http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/104/1042996p1.html |title=League of Legends Review |work=IGN |author=Butts, Steve |archivedate=November 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 23, 2010 |quote=The strategy elements are sound, and it can be fun to just pick a lane and start chewing through minions as you work your way towards enemy towers and champions. But sometimes it feels like League of Legends throws too much at the player, both in terms of the number of champions and the general confusion of the larger battles. While that's not enough to dampen your enthusiasm of the game, the vague status of the launch and the more-than-occasional hostility of the community just might.}}</ref>\n\nLeah B.

Citing a dissatisfaction with their post-college careers and the business practices of contemporary video game developers, they decided to create their own company dedicated to making [[free-to-play]] games that constantly evolved and developed through player feedback. Beck and Merill recruited ''Defense of the Ancients'' veteran [[Steve Feak|Steve \"Guinsoo\" Feak]], as well as several other experienced developers, to help them build and refine the game that would later become ''League of Legends''. Development, originally under the name ''Onslaught'', was difficult, owing to technical limitations and Beck and Merill's conflicting visions with many publishers at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/13/12891656/the-past-present-and-future-of-league-of-legends-studio-riot-games |title=The past, present and future of League of Legends studio Riot Games |first=Phil |last=Kollar |date=September 13, 2016 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref> They eventually partnered with Chinese conglomerate [[Tencent]], which now fully owns the game and a majority share of the company's stock.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/17/league-of-legends-fully-owned-by-tencent/|title='League of Legends' is now fully owned by China's Tencent|first=Steve|last=Dent|date=December 17, 2015|website=[[Engadget]]|access-date=January 26, 2020}}</ref> Three years after the company's founding, ''League of Legends'' was released with 40 champions on October 27, 2009.

In each game mode, teams work together to achieve a victory condition, typically destroying the core building (called the Nexus) in the enemy team's base after bypassing a line of defensive structures called turrets, or towers.\n\nIn all game modes, players control characters called champions, chosen or assigned every match, who each have a set of unique abilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/ |title=Champions : League of Legends |publisher=[[Riot Games]] |accessdate=February 25, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228160823/http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/ |archivedate=February 28, 2014 }}</ref> Champions begin every match at a low [[Experience point|level]],<!-- Not always level 1.--> and then gain experience over the course of the match to achieve a maximum level of 18. Gaining champion levels in matches allows players to unlock their champion's special abilities and augment them in a number of ways unique to each character. If a champion loses all their health, they are defeated but are automatically revived in their base after enough time passes. Players also begin each match with a low amount of gold, and can earn additional gold throughout the match in a variety of ways: by killing non-player characters known as minions and monsters; by killing or helping to kill enemy players; by destroying enemy structures; passively over time; and through unique item interactions or champion abilities. This gold can then be spent throughout the match to buy in-game items that further augment each champion's abilities and gameplay in a variety of ways. Champion experience, gold earned, and items bought are specific to each match and do not carry over to subsequent matches. Thus, all players begin each match on a more-or-less equal footing relative to their opposing team.\n\nAcross matches, players also earn rewards that are applied to their account. Player accounts begin at level one and progress onward with games played. Player level is separate from character level; both a level 30 account and a level 5 account would begin at character level 1 at the start of a new game. From 2009\u20132017, the maximum account level was 30, and as players progressed, they unlocked additional content and abilities. This system was reworked in November 2017, with the removal of the level 30 limit and removal of a Runes / Masteries system that gave in-game bonuses to players based on their account level.<ref>[https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/09/upcoming-changes-to-leveling-ip-rewards/ Upcoming Changes To Leveling, IP, & Rewards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107021307/https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/09/upcoming-changes-to-leveling-ip-rewards/ |date=November 7, 2017}}.

In the past, two other maps were featured as well, although they have since been discontinued.  Each map has different terrain, objectives as well as varied summoner spells and items.\n\n====Summoner's Rift====\n[[File:Map of MOBA.svg|thumb|240px|A simplified representation of Summoner's Rift. The yellow paths are the \"lanes\" where endless waves of troops known as minions march; blue and red dots are the defensive turrets that defend the lanes. Not pictured are the two turrets that flank each Nexus \u2013 the ultimate goal of the game, which are within each team's base in their corner. The dotted black line is the river that divides the sides.]]\n\nSummoner's Rift is the most popular map in ''League of Legends''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> On this map type, two teams of five players compete to destroy an enemy building called a Nexus, which is guarded by the enemy team and a number of defensive structures called turrets, or towers.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web |url=http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/summoners-rift/ |title=Summoner's Rift |work=leagueoflegends.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905055218/http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/summoners-rift/ |archivedate=September 5, 2015 }}</ref> One nexus is located in each enemy base on opposite sides of the map, in the lower-left and upper-right hand corners. These structures continually create weak non-player characters known as minions, which advance toward the enemy base along three paths: top, middle, and bottom lanes. Players compete to advance these waves of minions into the enemy base, which allows them to destroy enemy structures and ultimately win the match. Between lanes are neutral areas of the map known as the 'jungle', arrayed in four quadrants. A shallow river divides the map between the teams, but doesn't actually impede movement; all champions can wade through it no differently than dry land.\n\nEach team wishes to defend its own structures and destroy the other team's structures. These include:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boosteria.org/guides/league-legends-objectives-guide |title=League of Legends Objectives guide: Priority and Timers |work=boosteria.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305005126/https://boosteria.org/guides/league-legends-objectives-guide |archivedate=March 5, 2016 }}</ref>\n* Turrets \u2013 Each lane is guarded by powerful defensive structures called turrets. Turrets deal exceptionally high damage and will attack enemy minions and players that approach them. Turrets prioritize enemy minions in their vicinity, but will immediately attack enemy players if they attack allied players. Thus, by advancing an allied minion wave into the range of a turret, a player can do damage to the structure without themselves being attacked. When destroyed, turrets provide gold and experience. Turrets that are destroyed are destroyed permanently for that match and will not respawn. Some turrets, depending on location, will regenerate health over time if they are damaged but not destroyed.\n* Inhibitor \u2013 Each lane contains one inhibitor. A lane's inhibitor can be attacked after a team has destroyed the three turrets guarding its lane. Destroying an inhibitor will cause the allied Nexus to spawn Super Minions, more powerful Minions that provide a buff to surrounding Minions. If destroyed, inhibitors will respawn after five minutes.\n* Nexus \u2013 Each team has a Nexus that can only be damaged once all the turrets in a lane, that lane's inhibitor and the Nexus turrets are destroyed. Destruction of the enemy team's Nexus ends the game.\n\nSome objectives are 'neutral', meaning that they will not attack champions who pass by, but champions can choose to fight them if they wish to gain a reward at the cost of having to fight for it. They include:\n* Jungle monsters \u2013 Neutral monsters spawn at various intervals in the Jungle, and provides players with gold, experience, and sometimes other rewards for killing them. They are the most common neutral objective.<!-- Please do not add details about red buff and blue buff and their bonuses and transferring them. General overview, not specific.  -->\n* Elemental Drakes/Elder Dragon \u2013 Elemental drakes are powerful monsters located in the bottom half of the river. All members of the team that kills the drake are provided with buffs that last the entire game and accrue cumulatively. The drakes are flavored after the [[Classical element|Four Elements]], with each drake granting a thematically appropriate buff.  After a rework in 2019, three random different elemental drakes will spawn, with new ones coming six minutes after the previous one is killed.  After the third drake, all future drakes will be of that elemental type; once a team has slain 4 dragons, they get a \"Dragon Soul\" buff, and future dragon spawns are The Elder Dragon, which when killed provides a stronger buff than an individual elemental drake.\n* Rift Herald \u2013 The Rift Herald is a powerful enemy located in the upper side of the River. Killing the Rift Herald allows it to be summoned again as a battering ram to attack enemy towers.  From 2016&ndash;2019, it would not respawn after it is killed; after a rework in November 2019, it can potentially respawn once.<ref name=\"rift_herald2017\">[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/midseason-2017 Rift Herald] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706153609/http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/midseason-2017 |date=July 6, 2017}}</ref>\n* Baron Nashor \u2013 Baron Nashor is the most powerful neutral enemy, located in the upper side of the River. It will spawn after twenty minutes, replacing the Rift Herald. All living members of the team that kills Baron Nashor are given a buff which makes nearby minions more powerful. Baron Nashor will respawn seven minutes after it is killed.\n\nMany of the details have changed over time; ''League'' is not a static game, with mechanics being both introduced and removed since launch in 2009. For example, the Rift Herald was only added in 2016, and had its abilities reworked in 2017 and in late 2019;<ref>[https://na.leagueoflegends.com/na/site/2016-season-update/preseason.html 2016 Season Update] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107020148/https://na.leagueoflegends.com/na/site/2016-season-update/preseason.html |date=November 7, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"rift_herald2017\" /> Dragons gave gold rather than buffs from 2009\u20132014, and the dragons only became elementally flavored drakes in 2016; jungle monsters have been added and reworked; the length of time it took for inhibitors to respawn was 4 minutes rather than 5 minutes for a time; Baron Nashor gave a stronger buff to the statistics of champions but no buff to minions from 2009\u20132014; and so on.\n\n====Howling Abyss====\nThe Howling Abyss is used for \"ARAM\" (All Random All Mid) matches, and is five vs. five.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> The difference between the Abyss and the other maps is that there is only a single narrow lane of turrets and an inhibitor and no neutral jungle area. Thus, rather than skirmishes and hidden movement, the Abyss focuses exclusively on large team-fights in the sole middle lane. Players cannot return to their allied base to replenish health and mana or purchase items unless they have been killed.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> ARAM was launched as an official mode in September 2013.<ref name=\"escapistARAM\">[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/7.406935-League-Of-Legends-All-Random-All-Mid-Mode-Gets-Official League Of Legends' \"All Random All Mid\" Mode Gets Official] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629142319/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/7.406935-League-Of-Legends-All-Random-All-Mid-Mode-Gets-Official |date=June 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Twisted Treeline====\nIn the Twisted Treeline, two teams of three players compete to destroy the opposing team's Nexus, which is guarded enemy Towers.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web |url=http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/the-twisted-treeline/ |title=The Twisted Treeline |work=leagueoflegends.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702044249/http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/the-twisted-treeline/ |archivedate=July 2, 2015 }}</ref> It is conceptually similar to Summoner's Rift, but smaller to account for three vs. three rather than five vs. five.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Rather than Summoner's Rift 3 lanes of turrets and 3 inhibitors, Twisted Treeline has only 2 lanes and 2 inhibitors, with the jungle in between. The other differences are the addition of two \"Altars\", control of which grants the occupying team a variety of bonuses, and the replacement of Baron Nashor with Vilemaw, an evil spider deity. Living members of the team that slays Vilemaw are granted a temporary bonus, similar to the one granted by Baron Nashor.  Riot Games retired the mode in November 2019, due to declining playership.<ref>[https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/league-of-legends-twisted-treeline-will-be-retired-later-this-year League of Legends' Twisted Treeline will be retired later this year]</ref><ref name=\"tt-goodbye\" />\n\n====Crystal Scar====\nThe Crystal Scar was used for Dominion mode, a discontinued game format where teams of five players competed to capture control points and hold those points for the longest possible period of time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/the-crystal-scar |title=The Crystal Scar |work=leagueoflegends.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125153342/http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/the-crystal-scar/ |archivedate=January 25, 2014 }}</ref> The map consists of a circle with 5 control points. Each team controls a base known as a fountain, located at the bottom left and right-hand corners of the map. Each team scores points by capturing and owning more objectives than the other team over time, which is then reduced from the other team's \"life\" total. These points count down from an initial score of 200. The first team to reduce the other team to 0 points wins. Dominion was launched on September 26, 2011 and was retired on February 22, 2016, although the Crystal Scar is used for certain other rotating formats, such as Ascension.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-dominion-mode-launches/1100-6336613/ League of Legends: Dominion mode launches] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822014211/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-dominion-mode-launches/1100-6336613/ |date=August 22, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/retiring-dominion |title=Retiring Dominion |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316081135/http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/retiring-dominion |archivedate=March 16, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Games types===\n''League of Legends'' includes several game types players can select.<ref name=\"gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide |title=Matchmaking Guide |work=Riot Games Support |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906181359/https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide |archivedate=September 6, 2015 |access-date=September 18, 2015 }}</ref>\n* The Tutorial is the first game type available to new players. The tutorial is played on the Howling Abyss and is intended to teach new players the rules and gameplay of ''League''.\n* Co-op Vs. AI is available to new players after completing or opting out of the Tutorial. It is played on Summoner's Rift, Twisted Treeline, and (formerly) the Crystal Scar, and pits teams of human players against an opposing team of computer-controlled artificial intelligence champions.\n* Normal Matchmaking uses an automated matchmaking system to pair teams of similarly-skilled players against one another.\n* Ranked Matchmaking is available to players upon reaching account level 30. It uses a similar system as Normal Matchmaking; however, pre-made teams must be of comparable ELO strength, so expert players and weak players are not allowed to team together in Ranked. After playing 8 or more Ranked games, accounts are given a public \"rank\" that roughly correlates with their ELO ranking.\n* Custom Games allow players to play any map with any combination of player or AI teammates and opponents.\n\n''League of Legends'' also includes three ways teams may choose what champion they will play for a given match:\n* Blind Pick allows the two teams to select their champions simultaneously. The players only learn the champion selections of the opposing team when the match begins. It is available on Summoner's Rift, Twisted Treeline, and the Crystal Scar for Normal Matchmaking games and Co-op vs. AI, and for all modes in custom games.\n* Draft Pick allows each team to ban five champions each (a total of ten champions banned), removing them from the match. Teams then take turns selecting their champions while being able to see the selections of the other team. It is available on Summoner's Rift for matchmaking games, and for all modes in custom games.\n* Random Pick randomly assigns a champion to each player. Players accumulate re-rolls by playing multiple matches, which they can use to randomly select another champion for that match. It is available on Howling Abyss for ARAM (All Random All Mid) games, and for all modes in custom games.\n\n=== Champion types ===\nThere are currently 148 champions in ''League of Legends'' as of January 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/|title=Champions {{!}} League of Legends|website=na.leagueoflegends.com|access-date=2020-01-11}}</ref> ''League'' divides its champion types up a number of ways. The most salient difference is the type of damage a champion deals; some champions deal largely physical damage, which is resisted by the armor stat, and other champions deal largely magic damage, which is resisted by the magic resistance stat. Some champions deal with a combination of both and can choose which to emphasize; some rare abilities deal 'true' damage which is not mitigable by either armor or magic resistance. Riot Games has classified all champions as one of six types to aid beginners. Not all champions perfectly fit their type, of course. The official Riot classifications are as follows:\n* [[Glossary_of_video_game_terms#Damage_per_second|Marksman]]: Marksmen, also known as \"AD (attack damage) Carries\", are ranged champions that usually deal physical damage. These champions deal sustained damage over time rather than in a short burst, and are usually the best at destroying objectives like enemy turrets or elemental drakes. They tend to have weak defense in exchange for their high, exponentially scaling damage.\n* Mage: Mages, sometimes known as \"AP (ability power) Carries\", are champions with powerful magic damage and control skills, but weak defense and low mobility. Mages are a diverse set of champions. Some emphasize killing single champions from range very quickly; some specialize in area of effect damage to multiple targets whilst surviving in the middle of a fight; some specialize in immense range to attack enemies safely from afar. Some others blend up to two of these attributes. \n* Slayer: A champion who specializes in killing another champion quickly, most usually within melee range. These champions tend to go after the enemy's AD/AP Carry and other 'squishy' champions, but tend to have weak defenses themselves if caught. They are distinguished by having excellent mobility which allows them to reach and strike at priority targets. Slayers are divided between ''Assassins'' that flank and infiltrate enemies to select one target for death before escaping, and ''Skirmishers'' that rely more on strong sustained damage like a Marksman and unique defensive tools to remain in the fray.\n* [[Tank (gaming)|Tank]]: Champions who are hard to kill and soak up damage for their team. In exchange, they usually deal less damage but can compensate with useful \"crowd control\" abilities to distract or disable enemies or force enemies to fight through them first before they can attack the \"carries\". Tanks are divided between ''Vanguards'' that lead the charge into fights by disabling multiple enemies at once, and ''Wardens'' that are more concerned with protecting their own allies from enemy attacks.\n* Fighter: Champions that blend the attributes of a damage dealer and tank, combining moderate survivability with respectable damage. A common designation for close-range melee fighters, since they need to be able to survive long enough to close in on their target. There are two types of Fighters: ''Juggernauts'' that are largely immobile but have more extreme damage and survivability, and ''Divers'' that have more robust target selection at the cost of some survivability. \n* Controller: Champions whose skills are meant to directly aid the rest of the team by providing healing, buffing allies, debuffing the enemy team, disabling single targets, or a combination of the above. Typically referred to as \"support\" champions, controllers are often paired with another champion in the early laning phase of the game and focus on aiding their partner and harassing enemy champions rather than earning gold by slaying minions. Many different types of champions can serve as the \"support\", but tanks, healers, and certain types of mages are most common. Supports are expected to pay the most attention to the map as a whole, placing wards which grant vision and watching for surprise enemy movements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/3A5uuBw7-champion-subclass-list|title=Champion Subclass List|author=James \"Stattik\" Bach|date=January 2015}}</ref>\n\nItem choice plays an important role in the above and can shift the style of a champion. For example, if the champion Jarvan IV purchases all damage items, he functions something like an Assassin; he can kill enemies quickly but dies rapidly himself. If Jarvan buys all defensive items, he's a Tank focused on disruption and buffing his allies. Somewhere in-between, he's a Fighter. In the same way, champions like Morgana or and Lux can build item sets that are focused on high damage like a Mage, or item sets focused on disrupting enemies and aiding allies like a Controller. A handful of champions in the game offer unique playstyles that do not fit neatly into any particular class.\n\n=== Featured game modes ===\nRiot Games, starting in 2013, has released a number of special limited-time game modes. These special modes would usually be accessible for two weeks, then retired. In 2016, Riot announced that \"Rotating Games Mode\" would be a recurring event, so that every weekend a previously released game mode would be made accessible again for that weekend.<ref>[https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210354503-Rotating-Game-Modes-FAQ ROTATING GAME MODES FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220160741/https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210354503-Rotating-Game-Modes-FAQ |date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> Game modes include Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) and All Random Ultra Rapid Fire (ARURF), Hexakill (Twisted Treeline), One For All (Summoner's Rift), Nemesis Draft, Nexus Blitz, Nexus Siege, Legend of the Poro King, Doom Bots of Doom, and Hunt of the Blood Moon, Ascension, One For All (Howling Abyss), Hexakill (Summoner's Rift), Black Market Brawlers, Definitely Not Dominion, and Snowdown Showdown.\n\nThe Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) mode was originally a 2014 [[April Fools' Day]] prank that proved so popular it became a proper rotating game mode; in URF, champion abilities have no resource cost and have their cooldowns reduced by 80%, double the normal cap of 40% that can be attained through items. Additionally, champions have increased movement speed, reduced healing, faster passive gold gain, and faster attacks.<ref>{{cite web |title=Riot Broke League Of Legends, And Fans Love It |url=http://kotaku.com/riot-broke-league-of-legends-and-fans-love-it-1557292936 |work=Kotaku |accessdate=April 3, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404073054/http://kotaku.com/riot-broke-league-of-legends-and-fans-love-it-1557292936 |archivedate=April 4, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=League of Legends Releases Ultra Rapid Fire Mode |url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/04/01/league-of-legends-releases-ultra-rapid-fire-mode |work=IGN |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Teamfight Tactics}}''Teamfight Tactics'' ===\n{{Main|Teamfight Tactics}}\n''Teamfight Tactics'' is an [[auto battler]] game mode implemented on June 26, 2019.<ref name=\"AutobattlerIGN\">{{cite web |last1=Gilroy |first1=Joab |title=An Introduction to Auto Chess, Teamfight Tactics and Dota Underlords |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/04/a-guide-to-auto-chess-tft-league-of-legends-teamfight-tactics-dota-underlords |website=IGN |accessdate=July 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ye |first1=Josh |title=Auto battlers started with Dota Auto Chess and now Valve and Riot Games are joining in |url=https://www.abacusnews.com/who-what/auto-battlers-started-dota-auto-chess-and-now-valve-and-riot-games-are-joining/article/3017888 |website=Abacus |accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref> Based on the ''[[Dota 2]]'' mod ''[[Dota Auto Chess]]'', the mode centers around a battlefield consisting of hexagons, which players may take turns to strategically place champions onto a game board.

RP can be used to purchase champions, champion skins, ward skins, summoner icons, emotes, and certain multi-game boosts. An additional currency, Blue Essence (BE) (known as Influence Points from 2009\u20132017), is earned by playing the game and leveling up. ''League of Legends'' is free-to-play and all in-game purchases with a material effect on game-play may be acquired by either RP or BE. The final currency, Orange Essence (OE), can be used to unlock champion skins, ward skins, summoner icons, and emotes via the \"Hextech Crafting\".\n\n==Setting and lore==\n''League of Legends'' takes place in the fictional world of Runeterra. In Runeterra, the champions of ''League of Legends'' are a collection of heroes and villains who have a variety of backstories, often related to the political struggles of the various countries of the main continent of Valoran. Additionally, some champions are extraplanar and come from worlds other than Runeterra, but are visiting for their own purposes. These champions sometimes clash with each other, roughly reflected in the gameplay of ''League of Legends''.\n\nThe setting has gone through two phases: the \"original\" setting that was canon from 2009\u20132014, and the rebooted setting from 2014\u2013present.<ref name=\"exploringruneterra\">{{cite web |url=http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/dev-blog-exploring-runeterra |title=Dev Blog: Exploring Runeterra |last=Gnox |first=Tommy |date=September 4, 2014 |publisher=Riot Games |access-date=December 3, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206170736/http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/dev-blog-exploring-runeterra/ |archivedate=December 6, 2016 }}</ref> The original setting was very focused on justifying the exact mechanics of a game of ''League'' in the world of Runeterra. The MOBA predecessor to ''League'', ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'', featured two warring sides with two separate hero rosters; however, in ''League'', any combination of champions was legal to create a team. To explain this, in the original setting, Valoran was functionally ruled by extremely powerful time mages who could intimidate the other nations into compliance with their whims. They created the \"Institute of War\", also known as the \"League of Legends\", to resolve disputes and act as something like an international sports league. In these disputes, \"Summoners\" (a.k.a. the game player) could control any of Runeterra's greatest heroes or villains in their struggles, thus justifying why a team of 5 characters who all hated each other might form. Additionally, these time mages would actually power-down the characters to \"level 1\" before each match to make things 'fair'; some character's backstories even involved them explicitly having their powers sealed by the Institute of War due to them being too powerful otherwise, such as the demigoddesses Kayle and Morgana. This explained why characters might participate in multiple matches and have to relearn the same skills each time. After a match, a \"Judgment\" would sometimes be handed down, with the winning Summoners able to give land and privileges to those they favored.\n\nThe narrative team at Riot eventually decided this setup was too constraining, and \"rebooted\" the story behind ''League of Legends'' in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-just-destroyed-its-lore-will-start-o-1630783950 |title=League Of Legends Just Destroyed Its Lore, Will Start Over |last=Plunkett |first=Luke |date=September 4, 2014 |website=Kotaku |access-date=December 3, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216134356/http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-just-destroyed-its-lore-will-start-o-1630783950 |archivedate=December 16, 2016 }}</ref> In essence, the original story put too much emphasis on the faceless player stand-in Summoners and the Time Mages of the Institute; \"the very idea of all-powerful Summoners made Champions little more than puppets manipulated by godlike powers.\"<ref name=\"exploringruneterra\" /> Any interesting champions the Narrative team created were rendered as secondary, mere servants to the Summoners, unable to influence their own destiny. Many champion's lore did not give them reason to join the Institute, such as serial killer fire spirit Brand or void monster Rek'Sai. Riot wished to let champions take the center stage and have stories of their own, pursuing their own unique goals. For example, Riot has since released a plotline about a lost empire in the Shurima desert<ref>[http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-takes-its-new-lore-for-a-test-drive-1633297077 http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-takes-its-new-lore-for-a-test-drive-1633297077] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220041007/http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-takes-its-new-lore-for-a-test-drive-1633297077 |date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> and a plotline about a clash between the pirate Gangplank and the pirate-hunter Miss Fortune in the city of Bilgewater,<ref>[http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-just-killed-off-a-champion-1720995935 League Of Legends Just Killed Off A Champion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220043825/http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-just-killed-off-a-champion-1720995935 |date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> both of which were driven by the champions of League of Legends, not Summoners.

The game has been distributed to Tencent's growing 300&nbsp;million Internet user base through its leading QQ Game portal. The deal was one of only a handful of partnerships to bring a U.S.-developed online game directly to China.\n\nIn Europe, Riot Games initially signed an international licensing partnership with GOA, the video games department of Orange's Content Division and Europe's largest gaming portal. On October 13, 2009, GOA and Riot announced that they would start channeling server access for players located in Europe to GOA's dedicated servers. This partnership did not last; on May 10, 2010, Riot Games announced that they would take over distribution and operation of the game in Europe. To do so, Riot Games established a European HQ in Dublin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idaireland.com/news-media/press-releases/riot-games-inc-establishe/ |title=Riot Games Inc establishes EMEA Headquarters in Dublin |publisher=[[IDA Ireland]] |date=July 15, 2010 |accessdate=July 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017043621/http://www.idaireland.com/news-media/press-releases/riot-games-inc-establishe/ |archivedate=October 17, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nOn July 16, 2010, Riot Games announced that [[Garena]] would publish the game in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eu.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=17947 |title=Riot Games Partners with Garena to bring League of Legends to Southeast Asia |publisher=[[Riot Games]] |date=July 16, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722171650/http://eu.leagueoflegends.com/board/showthread.php?t=17947 |archivedate=July 22, 2010 }}</ref> Additionally, Southeast Asian players had the ability \"transfer accounts\" to import their progress stored in North American or European servers into the Southeast Asian server.

However, the game's confusing launch was criticized: it was felt that the title was released too early, with some features missing and others to be removed. Finally, the reviewer noted that high level players in the game have \"little patience for newcomers\", though the reviewer believed that matchmaking (not implemented at the time of review) would solve the problem by matching players of similar level together.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/104/1042996p1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110061331/http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/104/1042996p1.html |title=League of Legends Review |work=IGN |author=Butts, Steve |archivedate=November 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 23, 2010 |quote=The strategy elements are sound, and it can be fun to just pick a lane and start chewing through minions as you work your way towards enemy towers and champions. But sometimes it feels like League of Legends throws too much at the player, both in terms of the number of champions and the general confusion of the larger battles. While that's not enough to dampen your enthusiasm of the game, the vague status of the launch and the more-than-occasional hostility of the community just might.}}</ref>\n\nLeah B. Jackson of IGN re-reviewed the game in 2014, changing IGN's score from 8.0 to 9.2.

As a result, his wife Soelastri ([[Ratna Asmara]]) travels to the capital, [[Jakarta]], to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her to not come back.

The last studio, the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rd Ariffien]]'s ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Struggle''; 1943)&nbsp;\u2013 six short films, and several [[newsreel]]s. All were [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|pro-Japanese propaganda]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=339\u2013343}}\n\nAfter the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, a number of [[native Indonesian]] employees of Nippon Eigasha formed [[Berita Film Indonesia]], which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] Indonesian government.{{sfn|Danujaya|Tjasmadi|1992|p=50}} During the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]], allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of [[newsreels]] at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce [[fictional film]]s. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]], a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], stars of the film\n\n| image1    = Ratna Asmara p298.JPG\n| alt1      = Ratna Asmara, pictured in 1940\n| width1    = 182\n\n| image2    = Ali Yugo in Djaoeh di Mata.jpg\n| alt2      = Ali Yugo, pictured in 1948\n| width2= 200\n}}\nSPFC hired [[Andjar Asmara]], a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct ''Djaoeh Dimata'';{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|p=247}} However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and [[dialogue coach]]; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A.

Starring [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], it follows a woman who goes to [[Jakarta]] to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident.

As a result, his wife Soelastri ([[Ratna Asmara]]) travels to the capital, [[Jakarta]], to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her to not come back. Soelastri becomes a singer, and&nbsp;\u2013 unknown to Asrad&nbsp;\u2013 soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, \"Djaoeh Dimata\", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad. When Asrad recognises his wife's voice, they are reconciled.<ref>{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}}; {{harvnb|''Het Dagblad'' 1949, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe first two years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the [[Dutch East Indies]], with over forty [[List of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestic productions]] released.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=385\u2013387}} Following the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rd Ariffien]]'s ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Struggle''; 1943)&nbsp;\u2013 six short films, and several [[newsreel]]s. All were [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|pro-Japanese propaganda]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=339\u2013343}}\n\nAfter the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, a number of [[native Indonesian]] employees of Nippon Eigasha formed [[Berita Film Indonesia]], which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] Indonesian government.{{sfn|Danujaya|Tjasmadi|1992|p=50}} During the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]], allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of [[newsreels]] at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce [[fictional film]]s. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]], a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], stars of the film\n\n| image1    = Ratna Asmara p298.JPG\n| alt1      = Ratna Asmara, pictured in 1940\n| width1    = 182\n\n| image2    = Ali Yugo in Djaoeh di Mata.jpg\n| alt2      = Ali Yugo, pictured in 1948\n| width2= 200\n}}\nSPFC hired [[Andjar Asmara]], a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct ''Djaoeh Dimata'';{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|p=247}} However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and [[dialogue coach]]; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A.
