It is often considered one of the three [[Canadian Prairies|prairie provinces]] (with [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]]) and is Canada's [[Population of Canada by province and territory|fifth-most populous]] province with its estimated 1.377 million people. Manitoba covers {{convert|649950|km2|-2}} with a widely varied landscape, stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States. The province is bordered by the provinces of [[Ontario]] to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of [[Nunavut]] to the north, and [[Northwest Territories]] to the northwest, and the [[U.S. state]]s of [[North Dakota]] and [[Minnesota]] to the south.\n\n[[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]] have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years. In the late 17th century, [[fur trade]]rs arrived on two major river systems, what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system. A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called [[Rupert's Land]]. During the next 200 years, communities continued to grow and evolve, with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg. The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba. There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis people]] against the [[Government of Canada]], a conflict known as the [[Red River Rebellion]]. The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the [[Parliament of Canada]] passing the ''[[Manitoba Act]]'' in 1870 that created the province.\n\nManitoba's [[capital city|capital]] and largest city, [[Winnipeg]], is the [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|eighth-largest]] census metropolitan area in Canada. Other [[List of census agglomerations in Manitoba|census agglomerations]] in the province are [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]], [[Steinbach, Manitoba|Steinbach]], [[Portage la Prairie, Manitoba|Portage la Prairie]], [[Winkler, Manitoba|Winkler]], and [[Thompson, Manitoba|Thompson]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Manitoba'' is believed to be derived from the [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Anishinaabe language|Ojibwe]] or [[Assiniboine language|Assiniboine]] languages. The name derives from Cree ''manitou-wapow'' or Ojibwa ''manidoobaa'', both meaning \"straits of [[Manitou]], the Great Spirit\", a place referring to what are now called The Narrows in the centre of [[Lake Manitoba]]. It may also be from the [[Assiniboine language|Assiniboine]] for \"Lake of the Prairie\".<ref>{{vcite web|url=http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/prov_e.php#mb|title=Manitoba|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|accessdate=28 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604204017/http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/prov_e.php#mb|archivedate=4 June 2008}}</ref> which is rendered in the language as ''minnetoba''.<ref>{{vcite book|title=Strange Empire, a Narrative of the Northwest|last=Howard|first=Joseph Kinsey|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0873512985|page=192}}</ref>\n\nThe lake was known to French explorers as ''Lac des Prairies.'' Thomas Spence chose the name to refer to a new republic he proposed for the area south of the lake. [[M\u00e9tis]] leader [[Louis Riel]] also chose the name, and it was accepted in Ottawa under the ''[[Manitoba Act]]'' of 1870.<ref>{{vcite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/louis_riel/pdf/origin_mb_name.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2013|publisher=Province of Manitoba|title=The Origin of the Name Manitoba|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319044125/http://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/louis_riel/pdf/origin_mb_name.pdf|archivedate=19 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Main|Geography of Manitoba}}\n{{See also|List of provincial parks in Manitoba|List of protected areas of Manitoba|List of lakes of Manitoba}}\n[[File:Canada Manitoba Density 2016.png|thumb|right|Population density of Manitoba]]\nManitoba is bordered by the provinces of [[Ontario]] to the east and [[Saskatchewan]] to the west, the territories of [[Nunavut]] to the north, and the [[US states]] of [[North Dakota]] and [[Minnesota]] to the south. The province possibly meets the [[Northwest Territories]] at the [[Four corners (Canada)|four corners]] [[quadripoint]] to the extreme northwest, though surveys have not been completed and laws are unclear about the exact location of the Nunavut\u2013NWT boundary. Manitoba adjoins [[Hudson Bay]] to the northeast, and is the only prairie province to have a saltwater coastline. The [[Port of Churchill]] is Canada's only Arctic deep-water port. [[Lake Winnipeg]] is the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world. Hudson Bay is the world's second-largest bay by area. Manitoba is at the heart of the giant Hudson Bay watershed, once known as [[Rupert's Land]].

It is often considered one of the three [[Canadian Prairies|prairie provinces]] (with [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]]) and is Canada's [[Population of Canada by province and territory|fifth-most populous]] province with its estimated 1.377 million people. Manitoba covers {{convert|649950|km2|-2}} with a widely varied landscape, stretching from the northern oceanic coastline to the southern border with the United States. The province is bordered by the provinces of [[Ontario]] to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of [[Nunavut]] to the north, and [[Northwest Territories]] to the northwest, and the [[U.S. state]]s of [[North Dakota]] and [[Minnesota]] to the south.\n\n[[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous peoples]] have inhabited what is now Manitoba for thousands of years. In the late 17th century, [[fur trade]]rs arrived on two major river systems, what is now called the Nelson in northern Manitoba and in the southeast along the Winnipeg River system. A Royal Charter in 1670 granted all the lands draining into Hudson's Bay to the British company and they administered trade in what was then called [[Rupert's Land]]. During the next 200 years, communities continued to grow and evolve, with a significant settlement of Michif in what is now Winnipeg. The assertion of M\u00e9tis identity and self-rule culminated in negotiations for the creation of the province of Manitoba. There are many factors that led to an armed uprising of the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis people]] against the [[Government of Canada]], a conflict known as the [[Red River Rebellion]]. The resolution of the assertion of the right to representation led to the [[Parliament of Canada]] passing the ''[[Manitoba Act]]'' in 1870 that created the province.\n\nManitoba's [[capital city|capital]] and largest city, [[Winnipeg]], is the [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|eighth-largest]] census metropolitan area in Canada. Other [[List of census agglomerations in Manitoba|census agglomerations]] in the province are [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]], [[Steinbach, Manitoba|Steinbach]], [[Portage la Prairie, Manitoba|Portage la Prairie]], [[Winkler, Manitoba|Winkler]], and [[Thompson, Manitoba|Thompson]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Manitoba'' is believed to be derived from the [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Anishinaabe language|Ojibwe]] or [[Assiniboine language|Assiniboine]] languages. The name derives from Cree ''manitou-wapow'' or Ojibwa ''manidoobaa'', both meaning \"straits of [[Manitou]], the Great Spirit\", a place referring to what are now called The Narrows in the centre of [[Lake Manitoba]]. It may also be from the [[Assiniboine language|Assiniboine]] for \"Lake of the Prairie\".<ref>{{vcite web|url=http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/prov_e.php#mb|title=Manitoba|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|accessdate=28 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604204017/http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/prov_e.php#mb|archivedate=4 June 2008}}</ref> which is rendered in the language as ''minnetoba''.<ref>{{vcite book|title=Strange Empire, a Narrative of the Northwest|last=Howard|first=Joseph Kinsey|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0873512985|page=192}}</ref>\n\nThe lake was known to French explorers as ''Lac des Prairies.''
