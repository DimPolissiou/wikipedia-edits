It is also known as an '''abaciscus''' or '''abaculus'''.\n\n==Historical tessera==\nThe oldest known tesserae dates to the 3rd millennium BCE, discovered in the ancient city of [[Shahdad]] in [[Kerman]] province, [[Iran]].{{Citation needed |date=February 2019}}\n\nIn [[Classical antiquity#Archaic period (8th to 6th centuries BC)|early antiquity]], [[mosaic]]s were formed from naturally formed colored [[pebble]]s. By roughly 200 BCE cut stone tesserae were being used in [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]]-[[Ancient Greek art#Mosaics|Greek mosaics]]. For instance, a large body of surviving material from the Hellenistic period can be found in the [[mosaics of Delos]], Greece, dating to the late 2nd century BCE. [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] decorative [[Roman mosaic|mosaic panels]] and [[floor mosaic]]s were also produced during the 2nd century BC, particularly at sites such as [[Pompeii]]. [[Marble]] or [[limestone]] were cut into small cubes and arranged into representational designs and geometric patterns. \n\nLater, tesserae were made from colored glass, or clear glass backed with metal foils.  The [[Byzantine]]s used tesserae with [[gold leaf]], in which case the glass pieces were flatter, with two glass pieces [[gold glass|sandwiching the gold]].  This produced a golden reflection emanating from in between the tesserae as well as their front, causing a far richer and more luminous effect than even plain gold leaf would create.\n\n==Contemporary tessera==\n[[File:st.peters.basilica.tesserae.closeup.arp.jpg|thumb|right|A close up of the bottom left corner of the picture above.

They are made by molten glass being poured into trays and fired. An imprint of grooves is made on their underside for help with adhesion to cement when fixing. \n;'''Ceramic tesserae''':\nThese are the cheapest range of bought materials and can be glazed or unglazed.  The glazed ceramic tiles have the color painted onto the top of the clay and then fired to a high temperature in a kiln.  The unglazed or body glazed version has the color mixed into the wet clay so the color runs through them. They vary in size.\n;'''Smalti''':\nThis is the classic mosaic material. It is opaque glass fired in large slabs in a kiln and then hand cut with a hammer and hardy chisel into small cubes. Their irregular finish makes them a wonderful reflector of light and this material is best used working straight into cement. It is produced in Venice and sold by colour and weight.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/homes-and-gardens/design/small-tiles-big-tales/article5639010.ece | title=Small tiles, big tales | publisher=The Hindu | accessdate=25 September 2015 | author=Govind, Ranjani}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://blog.mozaico.net/stones-mosaic-tiles/ | title=Numerous Tiles and Tesserae Making Mosaics | publisher=Mozaico | date=24 June 2015 | accessdate=25 September 2015 | author=Menhem, Chantal | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925164439/http://blog.mozaico.net/stones-mosaic-tiles/ | archivedate=25 September 2015 }}</ref>\n;'''Gold smalti''':\nThis tile is made with real gold and silver leaf sandwiched between two layers of glass and fired twice in the kiln to embed in the metal.\n;'''[[Mirror]]''':\nMirror adds great depth and sparkle to a mosaic.

It is also known as an '''abaciscus''' or '''abaculus'''.\n\n==Historical tessera==\nThe oldest known tesserae dates to the 3rd millennium BCE, discovered in the ancient city of [[Shahdad]] in [[Kerman]] province, [[Iran]].{{Citation needed |date=February 2019}}\n\nIn [[Classical antiquity#Archaic period (8th to 6th centuries BC)|early antiquity]], [[mosaic]]s were formed from naturally formed colored [[pebble]]s. By roughly 200 BCE cut stone tesserae were being used in [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic]]-[[Ancient Greek art#Mosaics|Greek mosaics]]. For instance, a large body of surviving material from the Hellenistic period can be found in the [[mosaics of Delos]], Greece, dating to the late 2nd century BCE. [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] decorative [[Roman mosaic|mosaic panels]] and [[floor mosaic]]s were also produced during the 2nd century BC, particularly at sites such as [[Pompeii]]. [[Marble]] or [[limestone]] were cut into small cubes and arranged into representational designs and geometric patterns. \n\nLater, tesserae were made from colored glass, or clear glass backed with metal foils.  The [[Byzantine]]s used tesserae with [[gold leaf]], in which case the glass pieces were flatter, with two glass pieces [[gold glass|sandwiching the gold]].  This produced a golden reflection emanating from in between the tesserae as well as their front, causing a far richer and more luminous effect than even plain gold leaf would create.\n\n==Contemporary tessera==\n[[File:st.peters.basilica.tesserae.closeup.arp.jpg|thumb|right|A close up of the bottom left corner of the picture above.

They are made by molten glass being poured into trays and fired. An imprint of grooves is made on their underside for help with adhesion to cement when fixing. \n;'''Ceramic tesserae''':\nThese are the cheapest range of bought materials and can be glazed or unglazed.  The glazed ceramic tiles have the color painted onto the top of the clay and then fired to a high temperature in a kiln.  The unglazed or body glazed version has the color mixed into the wet clay so the color runs through them. They vary in size.\n;'''Smalti''':\nThis is the classic mosaic material. It is opaque glass fired in large slabs in a kiln and then hand cut with a hammer and hardy chisel into small cubes. Their irregular finish makes them a wonderful reflector of light and this material is best used working straight into cement. It is produced in Venice and sold by colour and weight.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/homes-and-gardens/design/small-tiles-big-tales/article5639010.ece | title=Small tiles, big tales | publisher=The Hindu | accessdate=25 September 2015 | author=Govind, Ranjani}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://blog.mozaico.net/stones-mosaic-tiles/ | title=Numerous Tiles and Tesserae Making Mosaics | publisher=Mozaico | date=24 June 2015 | accessdate=25 September 2015 | author=Menhem, Chantal | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925164439/http://blog.mozaico.net/stones-mosaic-tiles/ | archivedate=25 September 2015 }}</ref>\n;'''Gold smalti''':\nThis tile is made with real gold and silver leaf sandwiched between two layers of glass and fired twice in the kiln to embed in the metal.\n;'''[[Mirror]]''':\nMirror adds great depth and sparkle to a mosaic.

It is normally used to measure the height of horses in some English-speaking countries, including Australia,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.equestrian.org.au/site/equestrian/national/downloads/content/attachments/rules/02%20Mch-Nat%20Measuring%20Rules.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826125716/http://www.equestrian.org.au/site/equestrian/national/downloads/content/attachments/rules/02%20Mch-Nat%20Measuring%20Rules.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 August 2006 |title=Equestrian Federation of Australia National Measuring Scheme Effective from 1 January 2002 and amended in March 2002 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=March 2002 |website=www.equestrian.org.au/ |publisher=Equestrian Federation of Australia |accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref> Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States.\n\n===Light-nanosecond===\nThe light-nanosecond is defined as exactly 29.9792458 [[centimetre|cm]]. It was popularized as a unit of distance by [[Grace Hopper]] as the distance which a photon could travel in one billionth of a second (roughly 30 [[centimetre|cm]] or one [[foot (unit)|foot]]): \"The [[speed of light]] is one foot per nanosecond.\" In her speaking engagements, she was well known for passing out light-nanoseconds of wire to the audience, and contrasting it with light-microseconds (a coil of wire 1,000 times as long) and light-picoseconds (the size of ground [[black pepper]]). Over the course of her life, she found many uses for this visual aid, including demonstrating the waste of sub-optimal programming, illustrating advances in computer speed, and simply giving young scientists and policy makers the ability to conceptualize the magnitude of very large and small numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/tap/Files/hopper-story.html |title=Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper|date=4 May 2006 |publisher=US Navy}}</ref>\n\n===Metric foot===\nA [[metric foot]] (defined as 300&nbsp;mm, or about 11.8 inches) has been used occasionally in the UK<ref>{{cite web |  title=BBC TV Centre | website=History of Television Studios in London | url=http://www.tvstudiohistory.co.uk/tv%20centre%20history.htm | quote=Measurements are in metric feet (30cm)...}}</ref> but has never been an official unit.\n\n===Horse===\n{{main|Horse length}}\nHorses are used to measure distances in [[horse racing]] \u2013 a ''horse length'' (shortened to merely a ''length'' when the context makes it obvious) equals roughly {{convert|8|ft|m|1|abbr=off|disp=or}}.

The length of a [[Eight (rowing)|rowing eight]] is about {{convert|62|ft|m}}. A shorter distance is the ''[[Glossary of rowing terms#canvas|canvas]]'', which is the length of the covered part of the boat between the bow and the bow oarsman. The [[Racing Rules of Sailing]] also makes heavy use of boat lengths.\n\n===Football field (length)===\n<!--American football field (unit) redirects here.

The usual size of a football pitch is {{convert|105|x|68|m|yd|abbr=on}}, the dimensions used for matches in the [[UEFA Champions League]].\n\n===Block===\nA [[city block]] (in most US cities) is between {{convert|1/16|and|1/8|mi|m|abbr=on}}. In [[Manhattan]], the measurement \"block\" usually refers to a north\u2013south block, which is  {{convert|1/20|mi|m|abbr=on}}. Sometimes people living in places (like Manhattan)  with a regularly spaced street grid will speak of ''long blocks'' and ''short blocks''. Within a typical large North American city, it is often only possible to travel along east\u2013west and north\u2013south streets, so travel distance between two points is often given in the number of blocks east\u2013west plus the number north\u2013south (known to mathematicians as the ''[[taxicab geometry|Manhattan Metric]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html|title=Manhattan distance}}</ref>\n\n===The Earth's circumference===\nThe circumference of a [[great circle]] of the [[Earth]] (about {{convert|40000|km|mi nmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is often compared to large distances. For example, one might say that a large number of objects laid end-to-end at the equator \"would circle the Earth four and a half times\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D7153FF934A3575AC0A96F948260|title=Enough Burnt Sienna to Circle the Globe|date=7 September 1989}}</ref> According to [[World Geodetic System|WGS-84]], the circumference of a circle through the poles (twice the length of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]) is {{convert|40007862.917|m|yd}} and the length of the [[equator]] is {{convert|40075016.686|m|yd}}. Despite the fact that the difference (0.17%) between the two is insignificant at the low precision that these quantities are typically given to, it is nevertheless often specified as being at the equator.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nThe definitions of both the [[nautical mile]] and the [[kilometre]] were originally derived from the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. The nautical mile was defined as a [[minute of arc]] of [[latitude]] measured along any meridian. A circle has 360 degrees, and each degree is 60 minutes, so the nautical mile was defined as {{frac|1|21,600}} of the Earth's circumference, or about 1,852.22 [[metre]]s. However, by international agreement, it is now defined to be exactly {{convert|1852|m|ft}}.\n\nThe metre was originally defined as {{frac|1|10,000,000}} of the distance from a pole to the equator, or as {{frac|1|40,000,000}} of the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. This standard made the historical metre 0.0197% longer than the modern standard metre, which is calculated based on the distance covered by light in a vacuum in a set amount of time.\n\n===Earth-to-Moon distance===\nThe distance between the Earth's and the Moon's surfaces is, on average, approximately {{convert|380000|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=or}}.

In dynastic China, the [[k\u00e8]] was a unit that represented {{frac|1|100}} of a day (it has since been refined to {{frac|1|96}} of a day, or 15 minutes). In France, a decimal time system in place from 1793 to 1805 divided the day into 10 hours, each divided into 100 minutes, in turn each divided into 100 seconds; the [[French Republican Calendar]] further extended this by assembling days into ten-day \"weeks\". [[Ordinal date]]s and [[Julian day]]s, the latter of which has seen use in astronomy as it is not subject to [[leap year]] complications) allow for the expression of a decimal portion of the day.<ref>See, for instance, the [http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/daterdnm.sh current Mean Julian Day] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606205531/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/daterdnm.sh |date=6 June 2011 }}, precise to 6 decimal place, from the [[United States Naval Observatory]].</ref> In the mid-1960s, to defeat the advantage of the recently introduced computers for the then popular rally racing in the Midwest, competition lag times in a few events were given in centids ({{frac|1|100}} day, 864 seconds, 14.4 minutes), millids ({{frac|1|1,000}} day, 86.4 seconds) and centims ({{frac|1|100}} minute, 0.6 seconds) the latter two looking and sounding a bit like the related units of minutes and seconds.

NASA's Martian timekeeping system (instead of breaking down the sol into 25\u00d753\u00d767 or 25\u00d767\u00d753 SI second divisions) slows down clocks so that the 24-hour day is stretched to the length of that on Mars; Martian hours, minutes and seconds are thus 2.75% longer than their SI-compatible counterparts.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/spotlight/spirit/a3_20040108.html |title=Watchmaker With Time to Lose |website=JPL Mars Exploration Rovers |year=2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.space.com/20243-mars-rover-curiosity-discoveries-grotzinger.html |title=After Finding Mars Was Habitable, Curiosity Keeps Roving |first=Nola Taylor |last=Redd |website=space.com |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Darian calendar]] is an arrangement of sols into a Martian year.

Most dogs are sexually mature by 1 year old, which corresponds to perhaps 13 years old in humans. [[Giant dog breed]]s and [[bulldog]]s tend to have the strongest linear correspondence to human aging, with longer adolescences and shorter overall lifespans; such breeds typically age about nine times as fast as humans throughout their lives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610035254/http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archivedate=10 June 2009|title=Sexual Maturity&nbsp;\u2014 Spay and Neuter|publisher=Buffalo.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Galactic year===\n{{Main|Galactic year}}\nThe galactic year, GY, is the time it takes the solar system to revolve once around the galactic core, approximately 250 million years ([[megaannum]] or \"Ma\").

Each Kermit is equivalent to 14.4 minutes; the derivative math of (24 hours x 60 minutes/hour )/100. More precise time can be counted by dividing by 1000 or even 10000. The name Kermit came from a combination of the surname of the president of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] in 1983 (Dr. [[Larkin Kerwin]]). The original working model of KerMetric time as conceived by W. Thayer of NRC was assembled by the designated Clock Construction Team of John Phillips, Ron Hawkins, Les Moore and Willie Thayer in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.csgnetwork.com/timemetricdispcalc3.html|title=KerMetric Time Display Calculator|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Moment ===\nA '''[[Moment (time)|moment]]''' '''was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] unit of time'''. The movement of a shadow on a [[sundial]] covered 40 moments in a [[Solar time|solar hour]]. An hour in this case meant one twelfth of the period between [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]]. The length of a [[Solar time|solar hour]] depended on the length of the day, which in turn varied with the [[season]], so the length of a [[Moment (time)|moment]] in modern [[Second|seconds]] was not fixed, but '''on [[average]], a [[Moment (time)|moment]] corresponded to 90 seconds.'''\n\n===Thirds, Fourths===\n\nThe term \"[[Minute]]\" usually means {{frac|1|60}} of an [[hour]], coming from \"a minute division of an hour\". The term \"[[Second]]\" comes from \"the [[Second#Sexagesimal_divisions_of_calendar_time_and_day|second minute division]] of an hour\", as it's {{frac|1|60}} of a minute, or {{frac|1|60}} of {{frac|1|60}} of an hour. While usually sub-second units are represented with [[International_System_of_Units|SI]] prefixes on the second (e.g., [[millisecond|milliseconds]]), this system can be extrapolated further, such that a \"Third\" would mean {{frac|1|60}} of a second, and a \"Fourth\" would mean {{frac|1|60}} of a third, etc. These units are occasionally used in astronomy to denote angles.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Herschel |first=William |authorlink= |year=1785 |title=Catalogue of Double Stars |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] |volume=75 |issue= |pages=40\u2013126 |jstor=106749 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1785.0006 }}</ref>\n\n==Angular measure==\n===Furman===\nThe Furman is a unit of angular measure equal to {{frac|1|65,536}} of a circle, or just under 20 [[arcsecond]]s.

There is no consensus as to its name, but it has been called the 8-Bit Furman, the Small Furman, the Furboy and more recently, the miFurman, (milli-binary-Furman). These units are convenient because they form cycles: for the 8-bit unit, the value overflows from 255 to 0 when a full circle has been traversed, so binary addition and subtraction work as expected. Measures are often made using a [[Gray code]], which is trivially converted into more conventional notation. Its value is equivalent to [[Turn_(angle)#Tau_proposals|Tau]]/256 radians, or about 0.0245436926 radians.\n\n===Grade ''(also grad, gradian, gon)''===\n{{Main|Grad (angle)}}\nCoordinates were measured in grades on official French terrestrial ordnance charts from the French revolution well into the 20th century. 1 grade ''(or in modern symbology 1 gon)'' = 0.9\u00b0 or 0.01 right angle. One advantage of this measure is that the distance between latitude lines 0.01 gon apart at the equator is almost exactly 1 kilometer ''(and would be exactly 1&nbsp;km if the original definition of 1 meter = {{frac|1|10,000}} quarter-meridian had been adhered to)''. One disadvantage is that common angles like 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are expressed by fractional values (33{{frac|1|3}} and 66{{frac|2|3}} respectively) so this \"decimal\" unit failed to displace the \"sexagesimal\" units equilateral-vertex \u2013 degree \u2013 minute \u2013 second invented by Babylonian astronomers.{{POV inline|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Milliradian===\n[[File:mil estimation.jpg|thumb|upright|Estimating milliradian by hand]]\nThe [[milliradian]] (mrad) is an SI derived unit defined as one thousandth of a [[radian]], and has many useful purposes for measuring small angles.

The gallon gasoline equivalent is defined as 33.7 kWh,<ref name=EPAstudy10>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/label/420r10909.pdf|title=Environmental Protection Agency Fuel Economy Label \u2013 Final Report|authors=Office of Transportation and Air Quality, EPA, and [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]], Us DoT|publisher=[[US Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=September 2010|accessdate=20 February 2011}}</ref> or about 1.213{{e|8}} joules.\n\nEfficiency or fuel economy can be given as [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]].\n\n===Tons of TNT equivalent===\n{{Main|TNT equivalent|Richter magnitude scale#Examples}}\nThe energy of various amounts of the explosive [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (kiloton, megaton, gigaton) is often used as a unit of [[explosion]] energy, and sometimes of asteroid impacts and violent explosive volcanic eruptions. One ton of TNT produces 4.184{{e|9}} joules, or (by arbitrary definition) exactly {{10^|9}} [[calorie|thermochemical calories]] (approximately 3.964{{e|6}} BTU). This definition is only loosely based on the actual physical properties of TNT.\n\n===Hiroshima bomb and Halifax explosion===\n[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima - NARA 542192 - Edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Hiroshima bomb explosion]]\n[[File:Halifax Explosion blast cloud.jpg|thumb|upright|Halifax explosion]]\n{{Main|Moment magnitude scale#Nuclear explosions}}\nThe energy released by the [[Little Boy|Hiroshima bomb]] explosion (about 15&nbsp;kt TNT equivalent, or 6{{e|13}}&nbsp;J) is often used by [[geologist]]s as a unit when describing the energy of [[earthquake]]s, [[volcanic eruption]]s, and [[impact event|asteroid impact]]s.\n\nPrior to the detonation of the Hiroshima bomb, the size of the [[Halifax Explosion]] (about 3&nbsp;kt TNT equivalent, or 1.26{{e|13}}&nbsp;J), was the standard for this type of relative measurement. Each explosion had been the largest known artificial detonation to date.<ref name=TimeDisaster>{{cite book |title=Time: Disasters that Shook the World|publisher=Time Home Entertainment|location=New York City|date=2012|page=56|isbn=978-1-60320-247-3}}</ref>\n\n===Quad===\nA [[Quad (unit)|quad]] is a unit of energy equal to 1 Q = {{10^|15}}&nbsp;[[British thermal unit|BTUs]], or approximately 1.055{{e|18}}&nbsp;J (slightly over one exajoule).  It is suitably large to quantify energy usage by nations or by the planet as whole using everyday numbers.  For example, in 2004, US energy consumption was about 100 Q/year, while demand worldwide was about 400 Q/year.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Basic Choices and Constraints on Long-Term Energy Supplies|date=July 2004 |journal=Physics Today|volume=57|issue=7|pages=47\u201352|doi=10.1063/1.1784302|last1=Weisz|first1=Paul B.|bibcode=2004PhT....57g..47W|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Foe===\nA [[Foe (unit)|foe]] is a unit of energy equal to {{10^|44}}&nbsp;[[joule]]s (\u22489.478{{e|40}} [[British thermal unit|BTU]]) that was coined by physicist Gerry Brown of [[Stony Brook University]]. To measure the staggeringly immense amount of energy produced by a [[supernova]], specialists occasionally use the \"foe\", an acronym derived from the phrase [ten to the power of] '''f'''ifty-'''o'''ne '''e'''rgs, or {{10^|51}}&nbsp;[[erg]]s. This unit of measure is convenient because a supernova typically releases about one foe of observable energy in a very short period of time (which can be measured in seconds).\n\n==Other metric-compatible scales==\n===Power: Ton of refrigeration===\n{{Main|Ton of refrigeration}}\nThe rate at which heat is removed by melting {{convert|1|ST|kg|spell=in}} of ice over twenty-four hours is referred to as a ton of refrigeration, or sometimes a ton of cooling. This unit of refrigeration capacity came from the days when large blocks of ice were used for cooling, and is still used to describe the heat-removal capabilities of refrigerators and chillers today. One ton of refrigeration is equal to 12,000 BTU/h exactly, or 3.517&nbsp;kW.\n\n===Flow: Amazon River===\nThe volume of discharge of the [[Amazon River]] sometimes used to describe large volumes of water flow such as ocean currents. The unit is equivalent to 216,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s ([[cumec]]s).<ref>{{cite web | title=Amazon River \u2013 Facts, History, Animals, & Map | website=Encyclopedia Britannica | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River | access-date=10 August 2019}}.</ref>\n\n=== Flow: Sverdrup ===\nOne [[Sverdrup]] (Sv) is equal to 1,000,000 cubic metres per second (264,000,000 USgal/s). It is used almost exclusively in [[oceanography]] to measure the volumetric rate of transport of [[ocean current]]s.\n\n===Energy intensity===\nThe [[langley (unit)|langley]] (symbol Ly) is used to measure solar radiation or [[insolation]]. It is equal to one thermochemical [[calorie]] per square centimetre (4.184{{e|4}}&nbsp;J/m<sup>2</sup> or \u22483.684 BTU/sq&nbsp;ft) and was named after [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]]. Its symbol should not be confused with that for the light-year, ly.\n\n===Kinematic viscosity===\nOne of the few [[centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] units to see wider use, one [[kinematic viscosity|stokes]] (symbol S or St) is a unit of [[kinematics|kinematic]] [[viscosity]], defined as 1&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>/s, i.e., 10<sup>\u22124</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>/s (\u22481.08\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup>&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft/s).\n\n===Angular velocity===\n'''MERU''' (Milli Earth Rate Unit), an [[angular velocity]] equal to {{frac|1|1000}} of Earth's rotation rate: 1 MERU = 0.015 degrees/hour \u2248 0.072921 microradian/second. Sometimes used to measure the angular drift rate of an [[inertial navigation system]].<ref>''Fundamentals of High Accuracy Inertial Navigation,'' Averil B. Chatfield, [American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics], 1997, p.32</ref>\n\n===Electromagnetic flux===\nIn [[radio astronomy]], the unit of [[flux|electromagnetic flux]] is the [[jansky]] (symbol Jy), equivalent to 10<sup>\u221226</sup> [[watt]]s per square metre per [[hertz]] (= 10<sup>\u221226</sup>&nbsp;kg/s<sup>2</sup> in base units, about 8.8\u00d710<sup>\u221231</sup>&nbsp;BTU/ft<sup>2</sup>). It is named after the pioneering radio astronomer [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]]. The brightest natural radio sources have flux densities of the order of one to one hundred jansky.\n\n===Metre of water equivalent===\n{{main|Meter water equivalent}}\nA material-dependent unit used in [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]] and engineering to measure the thickness of shielding, for example around a [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]], [[particle accelerator]], or [[particle detector|radiation or particle detector]]. 1 mwe of a material is the thickness of that material that provides the equivalent shielding of one metre (\u224839.4&nbsp;in) of water.\n\nThis unit is commonly used in underground science to express the extent to which the [[overburden]] (usually rock) shields an underground space or laboratory from [[cosmic ray]]s. The actual thickness of overburden through which cosmic rays must traverse to reach the underground space varies as a function of direction due to the shape of the overburden, which may be a mountain, or a flat plain, or something more complex like a cliff side. To express the depth of an underground space in mwe (or kmwe for deep sites) as a single number, the convention is to use the depth beneath a flat overburden at [[sea level]] that gives the same overall cosmic ray [[muon]] flux in the underground location.\n\n===Strontium unit: radiation dose===\nThe [[strontium unit]], formerly known as the Sunshine Unit (symbol S.U.), is a unit of biological contamination by radioactive substances (specifically [[strontium-90]]). It is equal to one [[Curie|picocurie]] of Sr-90 per [[gram]] of body [[calcium]]. Since about 2% of the human body mass is calcium, and Sr-90 has a [[half-life]] of 28.78 years, releasing 6.697+2.282 [[electronvolt|MeV]] per disintegration, this works out to about 1.065{{e|-12}}&nbsp;[[gray (unit)|gray]]s per second. The permissible body burden was established at 1,000&nbsp;S.U.\n\n===Banana equivalent dose===\n[[File:Bananen Frucht.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.5|A banana contains [[naturally occurring radioactive material]] in the form of [[potassium-40]]]]\nBananas, like most organic material, naturally contain a certain amount of radioactive isotopes\u2014even in the absence of any artificial pollution or contamination. The [[banana equivalent dose]], defined as the additional dose a person will absorb from eating one banana, expresses the severity of exposure to radiation, such as resulting from nuclear weapons or medical procedures, in terms that would make sense to most people. This is approximately 78 nano[[sievert]]s \u2013 in informal publications one often sees this estimate rounded up to 0.1 \u03bcSv.\n\n===Molar mass of cellulose===\nIn the [[pulp and paper]] industry, [[molar mass]] is traditionally measured with a method where the [[intrinsic viscosity]] (dL/g) of the pulp sample is measured in cupriethylenediamine (Cuen). The intrinsic viscosity [\u03b7] is related to the weight-average molar mass (in [[atomic mass unit|dalton]]s) by the [[Mark-Houwink equation]]: [\u03b7] = 0.070 M<sub>w</sub><sup>0.70</sup>.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.chroma.2013.01.038|pmid = 23398992|title = A re-investigation of the Mark\u2013Houwink\u2013Sakurada parameters for cellulose in Cuen: A study based on size-exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle light scattering and viscometry|journal = Journal of Chromatography A|volume = 1281|pages = 32\u201337|year = 2013|last1 = Kes|first1 = M\u00fcr\u015fide|last2 = Christensen|first2 = Bj\u00f8rn E.}}</ref> However, it is typical to cite [\u03b7] values directly in dL/g, as the \"viscosity\" of the cellulose, confusingly as it is not a viscosity.\n\n===Iodine, bromine and kappa number===\nIn measuring unsaturation in fatty acids, the traditional method is the [[iodine value|iodine number]]. Iodine adds stoichiometrically to double bonds, so their amount is reported in grams of iodine spent per 100 grams of oil. The standard unit is a dimensionless stoichiometry ratio of moles double bonds to moles fatty acid. A similar quantity, [[bromine number]], is used in gasoline analysis.\n\nIn pulp and paper industry, a similar [[kappa number]] is used to measure how much [[bleaching]] a pulp requires. [[Potassium permanganate]] is added to react with the unsaturated compounds (lignin and uronic acids) in the pulp and back-titrated. Originally with [[Bleaching of wood pulp#Chlorine and hypochlorite|chlorine bleaching]] the required quantity of [[chlorine]] could be then calculated, although modern methods use multiple stages. Since the oxidizable compounds are not exclusively lignin and the partially pulped lignin does not have a single stoichiometry, the relation between the kappa number and the precise [[amount of substance|amount]] of lignin is inexact.\n\n==Demography and epidemiology==\n[[Demography]] and quantitative [[epidemiology]] are [[statistical]] fields that deal with [[count data|counts]] or proportions of people, or rates of change in these. [[Count data|Counts]] and proportions are technically [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]], and so have no [[units of measurement]], although identifiers such as \"people\", \"births\", \"infections\" and the like are used for clarity. Rates of change are [[rate (mathematics)|counts per unit of time]] and strictly have inverse time dimensions (per unit of time). In [[demography#Common Rates and Ratios|demography]] and epidemiology expressions such as [[Mortality rate|\"deaths per year\"]] are used to clarify what is being measured.\n\n[[Prevalence]], a common measure in [[epidemiology]] is strictly a type of [[denominator data]], a dimensionless ratio or proportion. [[Prevalence]] may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage or as the number of cases per 1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 in the population of interest.\n\n===Micromort===\n{{Main|Micromort}}\nA micromort is a unit of [[risk]] measuring a one-in-a-million [[probability]] of [[death]] (from [[micro-]] and [[Wikt:mortality|mortality]]). Micromorts can be used to measure riskiness of various day-to-day activities. A microprobability is a one-in-a million chance of some event; thus a micromort is the microprobability of death. For example, smoking 1.4 cigarettes increases one's death risk by one micromort, as does traveling {{convert|230|mi|abbr=in|order=flip}} by car.\n\n===Numbers of people: Stadium capacities===\n[[File:AFL Grand Final 2010 on the Melbourne Cricket Ground.jpg|thumb|To make large numbers of people comprehensible, the capacity of large stadiums is often used. Here the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) is in the process of filling with 100,016 spectators on [[2010 AFL Grand Final|AFL grand final day in 2010]].]]\nThe large numbers of people involved in [[demography]] are often difficult to comprehend. A useful visualisation tool is the audience capacity of large sports stadiums (often about 100,000). Often the capacity of the largest stadium in a region serves as a unit for a large number of people.

Among the ~300 million people in the United States, there are ~300 people struck by lightning annually and ~30 killed, making a lightning strike a one in a million event and a death a one in ten million event; given a mean life expectancy of slightly over 75 years, the chances of an American ever being struck in their lifetime is about 1 in 13,000.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Weather Service|title=NWS Lightning Safety Home Page|url=http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml|accessdate=27 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308162344/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml|archive-date=8 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nFor example: \"A person is about 15 times more likely to be struck by lightning in a given year than to be killed by a stranger with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or chronic psychosis\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gun Violence and Mental Illness|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26341929-gun-violence-and-mental-illness?from_search=true|accessdate=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Computer and information science==\nThe growth of computing has necessitated the creation of many new units, several of which are based on unusual foundations.\n\n===Data volume===\n[[File:Print vs. bytes.jpg|thumb|A CD-ROM can easily store the entirety of a paper encyclopedia's words and images, plus audio and video clips]]\nVolume or capacity of data is often compared to various famous works of literature or to large collections of writing. Popular units include bibles, encyclopaediae, [[complete works of Shakespeare|the complete works of Shakespeare]], and the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nWhen the [[Compact Disc]] began to be used as a [[data storage device]], the [[CD-ROM]], journalists had to compare the disc capacity (650 [[megabyte]]s) to something everyone could imagine. Since many Western households had a Christian [[Bible]], and the [[Bible]] is a comparatively long [[book]], it was often chosen for this purpose. The [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version of the Bible]] in uncompressed plain 8-bit text contains about 4.5 million characters,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10|title=The Bible, Old and New Testaments, King James Version \u2013 Project Gutenberg|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref> so a [[CD-ROM]] can store about 150 [[Bible]]s.\n\nThe print version of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' is another common data volume metric. It contains approximately 300 million characters,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/business/44-million-words-strong-britannica-to-join-internet.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|author=John Markoff|title=44 Million Words Strong, Britannica to Join Internet|accessdate=7 December 2011|date=8 February 1994|work=The New York Times}}</ref> so two copies would fit onto a [[CD-ROM]] and still have 50 megabytes (or about 11 bibles) left over.\n\nThe term ''Library of Congress'' is often used as an unusual unit of measurement to represent an impressively large quantity of [[data (computing)|data]] when discussing [[computer data storage|digital storage]] or [[computer network|networking technologies]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} It refers to the US [[Library of Congress]]. Information researchers have estimated that the entire print collections of the [[Library of Congress]] represent roughly 10 [[terabyte]]s of uncompressed [[text file|textual data]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info/how-much-info.pdf#page=110|author=Peter Lyman|author2=Hal R.

The nibble is used to describe the amount of memory used to store a digit of a number stored in [[binary-coded decimal]] format, or to represent a single hexadecimal digit. Less commonly, 'nibble' may be used for any contiguous portion of a byte of specified length, e.g. \"6-bit nibble\"; this usage is most likely to be encountered in connection with a hardware architecture in which the word length is not a multiple of 8, such as older 36-bit minicomputers.\n\n===FLOPS===\n{{Main|FLOPS}}\nIn [[computing]], FLOPS (''FL''oating point ''O''perations ''P''er ''S''econd) is a measure of a computer's computing power. It is also common to see measurements of kilo, mega, giga, and teraFLOPS.\n\nIt is also used to compare the performance of computers in practice.<ref>{{cite web |title=TOP500 LIST November 2018 |url=https://top500.org/lists/2018/11/ |website=Top 500 |publisher=Top 500 |accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== BogoMips ===\n{{Main|BogoMips}}\nA measure to determine the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] speed. It was invented by [[Linus Torvalds]] and is nowadays present on every [[Linux]] operating system. However, it is not a meaningful measure to assess the actual [[Central processing unit|CPU]] performance.\n\n===KLOC: computer program length===\nA computer programming expression, the [[source lines of code|K-LOC]] or KLOC, pronounced ''kay-lok'', standing for \"kilo-[[source lines of code|lines of code]]\", i.e., thousand lines of code. The unit was used, especially by [[IBM]] managers,<ref>{{cite web | title=Triumph of the Nerds: The Transcripts, Part II | website=PBS | url=https://www.pbs.org/nerds/part2.html | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> to express the amount of work required to develop a piece of software. Given that estimates of 20 lines of functional code per day per programmer were often used, it is apparent that 1 K-LOC could take one programmer as long as 50 working days, or 10 working weeks. This measure is no longer in widespread use because different computer languages require different numbers of lines to achieve the same result (occasionally the measure \"assembly equivalent lines of code\" is used, with appropriate conversion factors from the language actually used to assembly language).\n\nError rates in programming are also measured in \"Errors per K-LOC\", which is called the ''defect density''. NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center#Software Assurance Technology Center|SATC]] is one of the few organisations to claim zero defects in a large (>500K-LOC) project, for the space shuttle software.\n\nAn alternative measurement was defined by [[Pegasus Mail]] author [[David Harris (software developer)|David Harris]]: the \"WaP\" is equivalent to 71,500 lines of program code, because that number of lines is the length of one edition of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=April 2017 \u2013 \"How many WaPs is that?\" | website=Pegasus Mail and Mercury | date=30 November 2011 | url=http://www.pmail.com/devnews_archive.htm | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Ticks===\nThe \"tick\" is the amount of time between timer [[interrupt]]s generated by the timer circuit of a CPU.

The length of a [[Eight (rowing)|rowing eight]] is about {{convert|62|ft|m}}. A shorter distance is the ''[[Glossary of rowing terms#canvas|canvas]]'', which is the length of the covered part of the boat between the bow and the bow oarsman.

The usual size of a football pitch is {{convert|105|x|68|m|yd|abbr=on}}, the dimensions used for matches in the [[UEFA Champions League]].\n\n===Block===\nA [[city block]] (in most US cities) is between {{convert|1/16|and|1/8|mi|m|abbr=on}}. In [[Manhattan]], the measurement \"block\" usually refers to a north\u2013south block, which is  {{convert|1/20|mi|m|abbr=on}}. Sometimes people living in places (like Manhattan)  with a regularly spaced street grid will speak of ''long blocks'' and ''short blocks''. Within a typical large North American city, it is often only possible to travel along east\u2013west and north\u2013south streets, so travel distance between two points is often given in the number of blocks east\u2013west plus the number north\u2013south (known to mathematicians as the ''[[taxicab geometry|Manhattan Metric]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html|title=Manhattan distance}}</ref>\n\n===The Earth's circumference===\nThe circumference of a [[great circle]] of the [[Earth]] (about {{convert|40000|km|mi nmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is often compared to large distances.

Despite the fact that the difference (0.17%) between the two is insignificant at the low precision that these quantities are typically given to, it is nevertheless often specified as being at the equator.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nThe definitions of both the [[nautical mile]] and the [[kilometre]] were originally derived from the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. The nautical mile was defined as a [[minute of arc]] of [[latitude]] measured along any meridian. A circle has 360 degrees, and each degree is 60 minutes, so the nautical mile was defined as {{frac|1|21,600}} of the Earth's circumference, or about 1,852.22 [[metre]]s. However, by international agreement, it is now defined to be exactly {{convert|1852|m|ft}}.\n\nThe metre was originally defined as {{frac|1|10,000,000}} of the distance from a pole to the equator, or as {{frac|1|40,000,000}} of the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. This standard made the historical metre 0.0197% longer than the modern standard metre, which is calculated based on the distance covered by light in a vacuum in a set amount of time.\n\n===Earth-to-Moon distance===\nThe distance between the Earth's and the Moon's surfaces is, on average, approximately {{convert|380000|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=or}}. This distance is sometimes used in the same manner as the circumference of the Earth; that is, one might say that a large number of objects laid end-to-end \"would reach all the way to the Moon and back two-and-a-half times\".\n\nThe abbreviation for the Earth-to-Moon distance is \"LD\" which stands for \"[[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Lunar Distance]]\", used in astronomy to express close approaches of Earth by [[minor planet]]s.\n\n===Siriometer===\nThe [[siriometer]] is a rarely used astronomical measure equal to one million [[astronomical unit]]s, i.e., one million times the average distance between the Sun and Earth. This distance is equal to about 15.8&nbsp;[[light-year]]s, 149.6&nbsp;[[peta-|P]]m or 4.8&nbsp;[[parsec]]s, and is about twice the distance from Earth to the star [[Sirius]].<!--Google test prefers US spelling-->\n\n=== Pistol Shot ===\nCaptain Phillip chose a deep cove \"where ships could anchor at a half pistol shot from the shore.\"\n\n==Area==\n===Barn===\n{{Main|Barn (unit)}}\nOne barn is 10<sup>\u221228</sup> square metres, about the cross-sectional area of a uranium nucleus.

The amount of material that, say, an aircraft could carry into the air is often visualised as the number of bags of cement that it could lift.

In case of planet orbiting a star, ''M<sub>total</sub>'' can be approximated to mean the mass of the central object. More specifically in the case of Sun and Earth the numbers reduce to ''M<sub>total</sub>'' ~ 1, ''a'' ~ 1 and ''T'' ~ 1.\n\n==Time==\n<!-- Please keep these sorted in ascending order -->\n\n===Light-distance===\n[[George Gamow]] discussed measurements of time such as the \"light-mile\" and \"light-foot\", the time taken for light to travel the specified unit distance, defined by \"reversing the procedure\" used in defining a light-year.<ref>{{cite book |author=George Gamow|title=One Two Three ...

A sidereal day is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0905 SI seconds.\n\n===Decimal time systems===\n{{main|Decimal time}}\n[[File:Decimal_Time_Clock.jpeg|thumb|Decimal Time clock reading 2.50 DT equivalent to 6 AM standard time]]\nThe measurement of time is unique in SI in that while the [[second]] is the base unit, and measurements of time smaller than a second use prefixed units smaller than a second (e.g. microsecond, nanosecond, etc.), measurements larger than a second instead use traditional divisions, including the [[sexagesimal]]-based ''[[minute]]'' and ''[[hour]]'' as well as the less regular ''[[day]]'' and ''[[year]]'' units.\n\nSI allows for the use of larger prefixed units based on the second, a system known as [[metric time]], but this is seldom used, since the number of seconds in a day (86,400 or, [[leap second|in rare cases, 86,401]]) negate one of the metric system's primary advantages: easy conversion by multiplying or dividing by powers of ten.\n\nThere have been numerous proposals and usage of [[decimal time]], most of which were based on the day as the base unit, such that the number of units between any two events that happen at the same time of day would be equal to the number of days between them multiplied by some integer power of ten. In dynastic China, the [[k\u00e8]] was a unit that represented {{frac|1|100}} of a day (it has since been refined to {{frac|1|96}} of a day, or 15 minutes). In France, a decimal time system in place from 1793 to 1805 divided the day into 10 hours, each divided into 100 minutes, in turn each divided into 100 seconds; the [[French Republican Calendar]] further extended this by assembling days into ten-day \"weeks\". [[Ordinal date]]s and [[Julian day]]s, the latter of which has seen use in astronomy as it is not subject to [[leap year]] complications) allow for the expression of a decimal portion of the day.<ref>See, for instance, the [http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/daterdnm.sh current Mean Julian Day] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606205531/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/daterdnm.sh |date=6 June 2011 }}, precise to 6 decimal place, from the [[United States Naval Observatory]].</ref> In the mid-1960s, to defeat the advantage of the recently introduced computers for the then popular rally racing in the Midwest, competition lag times in a few events were given in centids ({{frac|1|100}} day, 864 seconds, 14.4 minutes), millids ({{frac|1|1,000}} day, 86.4 seconds) and centims ({{frac|1|100}} minute, 0.6 seconds) the latter two looking and sounding a bit like the related units of minutes and seconds. Decimal time proposals are frequently used in fiction, often in [[futurism|futuristic]] works.\n\nIn addition to decimal time, there also exist [[binary clock]]s and [[hexadecimal time]].\n\n===Sol===\n{{main|Sol (day on Mars)}}\n{{further|Timekeeping on Mars}}\nThe United States-based [[NASA]], when conducting missions to the planet [[Mars (planet)|Mars]], has typically used a time of day system calibrated to the mean solar day on that planet (known as a \"sol\"), training those involved on those missions to acclimate to that length of day, which is 88,775 SI seconds, or 2,375 seconds (about 39 minutes) longer than the mean solar day on Earth. NASA's Martian timekeeping system (instead of breaking down the sol into 25\u00d753\u00d767 or 25\u00d767\u00d753 SI second divisions) slows down clocks so that the 24-hour day is stretched to the length of that on Mars; Martian hours, minutes and seconds are thus 2.75% longer than their SI-compatible counterparts.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/spotlight/spirit/a3_20040108.html |title=Watchmaker With Time to Lose |website=JPL Mars Exploration Rovers |year=2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.space.com/20243-mars-rover-curiosity-discoveries-grotzinger.html |title=After Finding Mars Was Habitable, Curiosity Keeps Roving |first=Nola Taylor |last=Redd |website=space.com |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Darian calendar]] is an arrangement of sols into a Martian year. It maintains a seven-sol week (retaining Sunday through Saturday naming customs), with four weeks to a month and 24 months to a Martian year, which contains 668 or 669 sols depending on [[leap year]]s. The last Saturday of every six months is skipped over in the Darian calendar.\n\n===Dog year===\n[[File:10 yr old Mastiff.JPG|thumb|A 10-year-old [[Neapolitan Mastiff]]]]\nThere are two diametrically opposed definitions of the ''dog year'', primarily used to approximate the equivalent age of [[dog]]s and other animals with similar life spans. Both are based upon a [[List of common misconceptions|popular myth]] regarding the [[aging in dogs|aging of dogs]] that states that a dog ages seven years in the time it takes a human to age one year.\n*One seventh of a year, or approximately 52 days.<ref name=dogyear>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110612143355/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43339983/ns/today-today_pets_and_animals Multimillionaire pooch dies at age 12 (84 in dog years)].

Most dogs are sexually mature by 1 year old, which corresponds to perhaps 13 years old in humans. [[Giant dog breed]]s and [[bulldog]]s tend to have the strongest linear correspondence to human aging, with longer adolescences and shorter overall lifespans; such breeds typically age about nine times as fast as humans throughout their lives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610035254/http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archivedate=10 June 2009|title=Sexual Maturity&nbsp;\u2014 Spay and Neuter|publisher=Buffalo.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Galactic year===\n{{Main|Galactic year}}\nThe galactic year, GY, is the time it takes the solar system to revolve once around the galactic core, approximately 250 million years ([[megaannum]] or \"Ma\").

Each Kermit is equivalent to 14.4 minutes; the derivative math of (24 hours x 60 minutes/hour )/100. More precise time can be counted by dividing by 1000 or even 10000. The name Kermit came from a combination of the surname of the president of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] in 1983 (Dr. [[Larkin Kerwin]]). The original working model of KerMetric time as conceived by W. Thayer of NRC was assembled by the designated Clock Construction Team of John Phillips, Ron Hawkins, Les Moore and Willie Thayer in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.csgnetwork.com/timemetricdispcalc3.html|title=KerMetric Time Display Calculator|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Moment ===\nA '''[[Moment (time)|moment]]''' '''was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] unit of time'''. The movement of a shadow on a [[sundial]] covered 40 moments in a [[Solar time|solar hour]]. An hour in this case meant one twelfth of the period between [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]]. The length of a [[Solar time|solar hour]] depended on the length of the day, which in turn varied with the [[season]], so the length of a [[Moment (time)|moment]] in modern [[Second|seconds]] was not fixed, but '''on [[average]], a [[Moment (time)|moment]] corresponded to 90 seconds.'''\n\n===Thirds, Fourths===\n\nThe term \"[[Minute]]\" usually means {{frac|1|60}} of an [[hour]], coming from \"a minute division of an hour\". The term \"[[Second]]\" comes from \"the [[Second#Sexagesimal_divisions_of_calendar_time_and_day|second minute division]] of an hour\", as it's {{frac|1|60}} of a minute, or {{frac|1|60}} of {{frac|1|60}} of an hour. While usually sub-second units are represented with [[International_System_of_Units|SI]] prefixes on the second (e.g., [[millisecond|milliseconds]]), this system can be extrapolated further, such that a \"Third\" would mean {{frac|1|60}} of a second, and a \"Fourth\" would mean {{frac|1|60}} of a third, etc. These units are occasionally used in astronomy to denote angles.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Herschel |first=William |authorlink= |year=1785 |title=Catalogue of Double Stars |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] |volume=75 |issue= |pages=40\u2013126 |jstor=106749 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1785.0006 }}</ref>\n\n==Angular measure==\n===Furman===\nThe Furman is a unit of angular measure equal to {{frac|1|65,536}} of a circle, or just under 20 [[arcsecond]]s.

There is no consensus as to its name, but it has been called the 8-Bit Furman, the Small Furman, the Furboy and more recently, the miFurman, (milli-binary-Furman). These units are convenient because they form cycles: for the 8-bit unit, the value overflows from 255 to 0 when a full circle has been traversed, so binary addition and subtraction work as expected. Measures are often made using a [[Gray code]], which is trivially converted into more conventional notation. Its value is equivalent to [[Turn_(angle)#Tau_proposals|Tau]]/256 radians, or about 0.0245436926 radians.\n\n===Grade ''(also grad, gradian, gon)''===\n{{Main|Grad (angle)}}\nCoordinates were measured in grades on official French terrestrial ordnance charts from the French revolution well into the 20th century. 1 grade ''(or in modern symbology 1 gon)'' = 0.9\u00b0 or 0.01 right angle. One advantage of this measure is that the distance between latitude lines 0.01 gon apart at the equator is almost exactly 1 kilometer ''(and would be exactly 1&nbsp;km if the original definition of 1 meter = {{frac|1|10,000}} quarter-meridian had been adhered to)''. One disadvantage is that common angles like 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are expressed by fractional values (33{{frac|1|3}} and 66{{frac|2|3}} respectively) so this \"decimal\" unit failed to displace the \"sexagesimal\" units equilateral-vertex \u2013 degree \u2013 minute \u2013 second invented by Babylonian astronomers.{{POV inline|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Milliradian===\n[[File:mil estimation.jpg|thumb|upright|Estimating milliradian by hand]]\nThe [[milliradian]] (mrad) is an SI derived unit defined as one thousandth of a [[radian]], and has many useful purposes for measuring small angles.

The unit is equivalent to 216,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s ([[cumec]]s).<ref>{{cite web | title=Amazon River \u2013 Facts, History, Animals, & Map | website=Encyclopedia Britannica | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River | access-date=10 August 2019}}.</ref>\n\n=== Flow: Sverdrup ===\nOne [[Sverdrup]] (Sv) is equal to 1,000,000 cubic metres per second (264,000,000 USgal/s). It is used almost exclusively in [[oceanography]] to measure the volumetric rate of transport of [[ocean current]]s.\n\n===Energy intensity===\nThe [[langley (unit)|langley]] (symbol Ly) is used to measure solar radiation or [[insolation]]. It is equal to one thermochemical [[calorie]] per square centimetre (4.184{{e|4}}&nbsp;J/m<sup>2</sup> or \u22483.684 BTU/sq&nbsp;ft) and was named after [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]]. Its symbol should not be confused with that for the light-year, ly.\n\n===Kinematic viscosity===\nOne of the few [[centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] units to see wider use, one [[kinematic viscosity|stokes]] (symbol S or St) is a unit of [[kinematics|kinematic]] [[viscosity]], defined as 1&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>/s, i.e., 10<sup>\u22124</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>/s (\u22481.08\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup>&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft/s).\n\n===Angular velocity===\n'''MERU''' (Milli Earth Rate Unit), an [[angular velocity]] equal to {{frac|1|1000}} of Earth's rotation rate: 1 MERU = 0.015 degrees/hour \u2248 0.072921 microradian/second. Sometimes used to measure the angular drift rate of an [[inertial navigation system]].<ref>''Fundamentals of High Accuracy Inertial Navigation,'' Averil B. Chatfield, [American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics], 1997, p.32</ref>\n\n===Electromagnetic flux===\nIn [[radio astronomy]], the unit of [[flux|electromagnetic flux]] is the [[jansky]] (symbol Jy), equivalent to 10<sup>\u221226</sup> [[watt]]s per square metre per [[hertz]] (= 10<sup>\u221226</sup>&nbsp;kg/s<sup>2</sup> in base units, about 8.8\u00d710<sup>\u221231</sup>&nbsp;BTU/ft<sup>2</sup>). It is named after the pioneering radio astronomer [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]]. The brightest natural radio sources have flux densities of the order of one to one hundred jansky.\n\n===Metre of water equivalent===\n{{main|Meter water equivalent}}\nA material-dependent unit used in [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]] and engineering to measure the thickness of shielding, for example around a [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]], [[particle accelerator]], or [[particle detector|radiation or particle detector]]. 1 mwe of a material is the thickness of that material that provides the equivalent shielding of one metre (\u224839.4&nbsp;in) of water.\n\nThis unit is commonly used in underground science to express the extent to which the [[overburden]] (usually rock) shields an underground space or laboratory from [[cosmic ray]]s. The actual thickness of overburden through which cosmic rays must traverse to reach the underground space varies as a function of direction due to the shape of the overburden, which may be a mountain, or a flat plain, or something more complex like a cliff side. To express the depth of an underground space in mwe (or kmwe for deep sites) as a single number, the convention is to use the depth beneath a flat overburden at [[sea level]] that gives the same overall cosmic ray [[muon]] flux in the underground location.\n\n===Strontium unit: radiation dose===\nThe [[strontium unit]], formerly known as the Sunshine Unit (symbol S.U.), is a unit of biological contamination by radioactive substances (specifically [[strontium-90]]). It is equal to one [[Curie|picocurie]] of Sr-90 per [[gram]] of body [[calcium]]. Since about 2% of the human body mass is calcium, and Sr-90 has a [[half-life]] of 28.78 years, releasing 6.697+2.282 [[electronvolt|MeV]] per disintegration, this works out to about 1.065{{e|-12}}&nbsp;[[gray (unit)|gray]]s per second. The permissible body burden was established at 1,000&nbsp;S.U.\n\n===Banana equivalent dose===\n[[File:Bananen Frucht.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.5|A banana contains [[naturally occurring radioactive material]] in the form of [[potassium-40]]]]\nBananas, like most organic material, naturally contain a certain amount of radioactive isotopes\u2014even in the absence of any artificial pollution or contamination. The [[banana equivalent dose]], defined as the additional dose a person will absorb from eating one banana, expresses the severity of exposure to radiation, such as resulting from nuclear weapons or medical procedures, in terms that would make sense to most people. This is approximately 78 nano[[sievert]]s \u2013 in informal publications one often sees this estimate rounded up to 0.1 \u03bcSv.\n\n===Molar mass of cellulose===\nIn the [[pulp and paper]] industry, [[molar mass]] is traditionally measured with a method where the [[intrinsic viscosity]] (dL/g) of the pulp sample is measured in cupriethylenediamine (Cuen). The intrinsic viscosity [\u03b7] is related to the weight-average molar mass (in [[atomic mass unit|dalton]]s) by the [[Mark-Houwink equation]]: [\u03b7] = 0.070 M<sub>w</sub><sup>0.70</sup>.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.chroma.2013.01.038|pmid = 23398992|title = A re-investigation of the Mark\u2013Houwink\u2013Sakurada parameters for cellulose in Cuen: A study based on size-exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle light scattering and viscometry|journal = Journal of Chromatography A|volume = 1281|pages = 32\u201337|year = 2013|last1 = Kes|first1 = M\u00fcr\u015fide|last2 = Christensen|first2 = Bj\u00f8rn E.}}</ref> However, it is typical to cite [\u03b7] values directly in dL/g, as the \"viscosity\" of the cellulose, confusingly as it is not a viscosity.\n\n===Iodine, bromine and kappa number===\nIn measuring unsaturation in fatty acids, the traditional method is the [[iodine value|iodine number]]. Iodine adds stoichiometrically to double bonds, so their amount is reported in grams of iodine spent per 100 grams of oil. The standard unit is a dimensionless stoichiometry ratio of moles double bonds to moles fatty acid. A similar quantity, [[bromine number]], is used in gasoline analysis.\n\nIn pulp and paper industry, a similar [[kappa number]] is used to measure how much [[bleaching]] a pulp requires. [[Potassium permanganate]] is added to react with the unsaturated compounds (lignin and uronic acids) in the pulp and back-titrated. Originally with [[Bleaching of wood pulp#Chlorine and hypochlorite|chlorine bleaching]] the required quantity of [[chlorine]] could be then calculated, although modern methods use multiple stages. Since the oxidizable compounds are not exclusively lignin and the partially pulped lignin does not have a single stoichiometry, the relation between the kappa number and the precise [[amount of substance|amount]] of lignin is inexact.\n\n==Demography and epidemiology==\n[[Demography]] and quantitative [[epidemiology]] are [[statistical]] fields that deal with [[count data|counts]] or proportions of people, or rates of change in these. [[Count data|Counts]] and proportions are technically [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]], and so have no [[units of measurement]], although identifiers such as \"people\", \"births\", \"infections\" and the like are used for clarity. Rates of change are [[rate (mathematics)|counts per unit of time]] and strictly have inverse time dimensions (per unit of time). In [[demography#Common Rates and Ratios|demography]] and epidemiology expressions such as [[Mortality rate|\"deaths per year\"]] are used to clarify what is being measured.\n\n[[Prevalence]], a common measure in [[epidemiology]] is strictly a type of [[denominator data]], a dimensionless ratio or proportion. [[Prevalence]] may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage or as the number of cases per 1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 in the population of interest.\n\n===Micromort===\n{{Main|Micromort}}\nA micromort is a unit of [[risk]] measuring a one-in-a-million [[probability]] of [[death]] (from [[micro-]] and [[Wikt:mortality|mortality]]). Micromorts can be used to measure riskiness of various day-to-day activities. A microprobability is a one-in-a million chance of some event; thus a micromort is the microprobability of death. For example, smoking 1.4 cigarettes increases one's death risk by one micromort, as does traveling {{convert|230|mi|abbr=in|order=flip}} by car.\n\n===Numbers of people: Stadium capacities===\n[[File:AFL Grand Final 2010 on the Melbourne Cricket Ground.jpg|thumb|To make large numbers of people comprehensible, the capacity of large stadiums is often used. Here the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) is in the process of filling with 100,016 spectators on [[2010 AFL Grand Final|AFL grand final day in 2010]].]]\nThe large numbers of people involved in [[demography]] are often difficult to comprehend. A useful visualisation tool is the audience capacity of large sports stadiums (often about 100,000). Often the capacity of the largest stadium in a region serves as a unit for a large number of people. For example, Uruguay's [[Estadio Centenario]] is often used in [[Uruguay]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Ahora la borrachera es \"previa\" a la fiesta | website=elpais.com.uy | date=15 October 2009 | url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/091011/pciuda-447246/ciudades/ahora-la-borrachera-es-previa-a-la-fiesta | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015002051/http://www.elpais.com.uy/091011/pciuda-447246/ciudades/ahora-la-borrachera-es-previa-a-la-fiesta | archive-date=15 October 2009 | url-status=dead | language=es | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The unemployed would fill three and a half Centennial Stadiums (Spanish) | website=LARED21 | date=7 November 2002 | url=http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/97129-los-desocupados-colmarian-tres-y-medio-estadios-centenarios | language=es | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> while in parts of the United States, [[Michigan Stadium]] is used in this manner.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In Australia, the capacity of the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (about 100,000) is often cited in this manner.

Among the ~300 million people in the United States, there are ~300 people struck by lightning annually and ~30 killed, making a lightning strike a one in a million event and a death a one in ten million event; given a mean life expectancy of slightly over 75 years, the chances of an American ever being struck in their lifetime is about 1 in 13,000.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Weather Service|title=NWS Lightning Safety Home Page|url=http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml|accessdate=27 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308162344/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml|archive-date=8 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nFor example: \"A person is about 15 times more likely to be struck by lightning in a given year than to be killed by a stranger with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or chronic psychosis\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gun Violence and Mental Illness|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26341929-gun-violence-and-mental-illness?from_search=true|accessdate=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Computer and information science==\nThe growth of computing has necessitated the creation of many new units, several of which are based on unusual foundations.\n\n===Data volume===\n[[File:Print vs. bytes.jpg|thumb|A CD-ROM can easily store the entirety of a paper encyclopedia's words and images, plus audio and video clips]]\nVolume or capacity of data is often compared to various famous works of literature or to large collections of writing. Popular units include bibles, encyclopaediae, [[complete works of Shakespeare|the complete works of Shakespeare]], and the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nWhen the [[Compact Disc]] began to be used as a [[data storage device]], the [[CD-ROM]], journalists had to compare the disc capacity (650 [[megabyte]]s) to something everyone could imagine. Since many Western households had a Christian [[Bible]], and the [[Bible]] is a comparatively long [[book]], it was often chosen for this purpose. The [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version of the Bible]] in uncompressed plain 8-bit text contains about 4.5 million characters,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10|title=The Bible, Old and New Testaments, King James Version \u2013 Project Gutenberg|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref> so a [[CD-ROM]] can store about 150 [[Bible]]s.\n\nThe print version of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' is another common data volume metric. It contains approximately 300 million characters,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/business/44-million-words-strong-britannica-to-join-internet.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|author=John Markoff|title=44 Million Words Strong, Britannica to Join Internet|accessdate=7 December 2011|date=8 February 1994|work=The New York Times}}</ref> so two copies would fit onto a [[CD-ROM]] and still have 50 megabytes (or about 11 bibles) left over.\n\nThe term ''Library of Congress'' is often used as an unusual unit of measurement to represent an impressively large quantity of [[data (computing)|data]] when discussing [[computer data storage|digital storage]] or [[computer network|networking technologies]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} It refers to the US [[Library of Congress]]. Information researchers have estimated that the entire print collections of the [[Library of Congress]] represent roughly 10 [[terabyte]]s of uncompressed [[text file|textual data]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info/how-much-info.pdf#page=110|author=Peter Lyman|author2=Hal R.

The nibble is used to describe the amount of memory used to store a digit of a number stored in [[binary-coded decimal]] format, or to represent a single hexadecimal digit. Less commonly, 'nibble' may be used for any contiguous portion of a byte of specified length, e.g. \"6-bit nibble\"; this usage is most likely to be encountered in connection with a hardware architecture in which the word length is not a multiple of 8, such as older 36-bit minicomputers.\n\n===FLOPS===\n{{Main|FLOPS}}\nIn [[computing]], FLOPS (''FL''oating point ''O''perations ''P''er ''S''econd) is a measure of a computer's computing power. It is also common to see measurements of kilo, mega, giga, and teraFLOPS.\n\nIt is also used to compare the performance of computers in practice.<ref>{{cite web |title=TOP500 LIST November 2018 |url=https://top500.org/lists/2018/11/ |website=Top 500 |publisher=Top 500 |accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== BogoMips ===\n{{Main|BogoMips}}\nA measure to determine the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] speed. It was invented by [[Linus Torvalds]] and is nowadays present on every [[Linux]] operating system. However, it is not a meaningful measure to assess the actual [[Central processing unit|CPU]] performance.\n\n===KLOC: computer program length===\nA computer programming expression, the [[source lines of code|K-LOC]] or KLOC, pronounced ''kay-lok'', standing for \"kilo-[[source lines of code|lines of code]]\", i.e., thousand lines of code. The unit was used, especially by [[IBM]] managers,<ref>{{cite web | title=Triumph of the Nerds: The Transcripts, Part II | website=PBS | url=https://www.pbs.org/nerds/part2.html | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> to express the amount of work required to develop a piece of software. Given that estimates of 20 lines of functional code per day per programmer were often used, it is apparent that 1 K-LOC could take one programmer as long as 50 working days, or 10 working weeks. This measure is no longer in widespread use because different computer languages require different numbers of lines to achieve the same result (occasionally the measure \"assembly equivalent lines of code\" is used, with appropriate conversion factors from the language actually used to assembly language).\n\nError rates in programming are also measured in \"Errors per K-LOC\", which is called the ''defect density''. NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center#Software Assurance Technology Center|SATC]] is one of the few organisations to claim zero defects in a large (>500K-LOC) project, for the space shuttle software.\n\nAn alternative measurement was defined by [[Pegasus Mail]] author [[David Harris (software developer)|David Harris]]: the \"WaP\" is equivalent to 71,500 lines of program code, because that number of lines is the length of one edition of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=April 2017 \u2013 \"How many WaPs is that?\" | website=Pegasus Mail and Mercury | date=30 November 2011 | url=http://www.pmail.com/devnews_archive.htm | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Ticks===\nThe \"tick\" is the amount of time between timer [[interrupt]]s generated by the timer circuit of a CPU.

[[James D. Hardy]], [[Herbert G. Wolff]], and [[Helen Goodell]] of [[Cornell University]] proposed the unit based on their studies of pain during the 1940s and 1950s. They defined one dol to equal to \"just noticeable differences\" ([[jnd]]'s) in pain. The unit never came into widespread use and other methods are now used to assess the level of pain experienced by patients.\n\nThe Schmidt sting pain index and Starr sting pain index are [[pain scale]]s rating the relative pain caused by different [[hymenoptera]]n stings. Schmidt has refined his [[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]] (scaled from 1 to 4) with extensive anecdotal experience, culminating in a paper published in 1990 which classifies the stings of 78 species and 41 genera of Hymenoptera.

Traffic of one erlang refers to a single [[resource (project management)|resource]] being in continuous use, or two [[channel (communications)|channel]]s being at fifty percent use, and so on, [[wikt:pro rata|pro rata]]. Much telecommunications management and forecasting software uses this.\n\n===Waffle House Index ===\n{{Main|Waffle House Index}}\n[[Waffle House Index]] is used by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) to determine the impact of a storm and the likely scale of assistance required for disaster recovery. The measure is based on the reputation of the [[Waffle House]] restaurant chain for staying open during extreme weather. This term was coined by FEMA Administrator [[Craig Fugate]].\n\n===X-ray intensity===\n{{Main|Crab (unit)}}\nThe crab is defined as the intensity of X-rays emitted from the [[Crab Nebula]] at a given photon energy up to 30 kilo[[electronvolts]]. The Crab Nebula is often used for calibration of X-ray telescopes.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there.
