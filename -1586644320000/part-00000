BTWHS-EC aims to prepare students to pursue post-secondary education at some of the top universities and colleges in the U.S.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlantapublicschools.us/domain/11274|title=Early College / Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=http|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the core program of study, students are required to take the following classes to meet the requirements of the Early College School:\n* Early College Seminar\n* Early College Math\n* Early College English\n* Early College Social Studies\n* Early College Science\n\n===Washington Banking, Finance, and Investment===\nThe Booker T. Washington High School Banking, Finance and Investment Small School (BFI) gives BTW high school students an opportunity to learn about and prepare for college careers in business and finance. Emphasis is placed on a college preparatory curriculum that is directly linked to the business world.\n\nThis school prepares students for careers in business and finance with challenging courses. It focuses on broad, transferable skills, with an emphasis on financial industry elements such as accounting, financial planning, management, banking, credit, economics, money management, technology, investments, and insurance. In addition to their required courses, BFI students take one or two specialized courses each semester and a college-level course in their senior year. Students also participate in job shadowing experiences and paid internships.\n\nBFI is a part of the National Academy Foundation's Academy of Finance. This foundation assists in establishing an ongoing relationship that involves corporate executives, school personnel, parents, and students, and results in paid internships, scholarships, and employment opportunities. Students are provided opportunities to enter into paid internships with local financial service companies during the summer of their senior year, and many offers of part-time employment during the school year are provided.  BFI also has the Institute of Student Achievement (ISA) as its intermediary partner. This organization supports the school's planning process, curriculum development, leadership development, and overall development of the small learning communities.\n\n===Washington Health, Science, and Nutrition===\nThe Booker T. Washington High School of Health Science and Nutrition (BTWHSN) provides an interdisciplinary curriculum with a healthcare and nutrition concentration through in-depth investigation, hands-on discovery, experimentation, and inquiry-based learning. Through a four-year program of study, students have the opportunity to:\n\n* Undergo a rigorous and relevant curriculum and receive in-depth instruction designed to ensure that all students meet the graduation requirements of the Atlanta Public Schools system while affording them multiple opportunities for postsecondary study.\n* Gain college credit through dual enrollment and advanced placement courses.\n* Explore career interest in various nutrition and healthcare-related fields.\n* Gain invaluable knowledge, skills, and experiences through medical seminars, internships, and health science field trips.\n* Partake in an array of shadowing opportunities and hands-on modules.\n\nBooker T.

Washington High School-Early College is one of the newest early college small schools in the Atlanta Public School System.  The premise behind the early college concept is to afford students the opportunity to obtain college credits while going to high school.  BTWHS-EC aims to prepare students to pursue post secondary education at some of the top universities and colleges in the U.S.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlantapublicschools.us/domain/11274|title=Early College / Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=http|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the core program of study, students are required to take the following classes to meet the requirements of the Early College School:\n* Early College Seminar\n* Early College Math\n* Early College English\n* Early College Social Studies\n* Early College Science\n\n===Washington Banking, Finance, and Investment===\nThe Booker T. Washington High School Banking, Finance and Investment Small School (BFI) gives BTW high school students an opportunity to learn about and prepare for college careers in business and finance. Emphasis is placed on a college preparatory curriculum that is directly linked to the business world.\n\nThis school prepares students for careers in business and finance with challenging courses. It focuses on broad, transferable skills, with an emphasis on financial industry elements such as accounting, financial planning, management, banking, credit, economics, money management, technology, investments, and insurance. In addition to their required courses, BFI students take one or two specialized courses each semester and a college level course in their senior year. Students also participate in job shadowing experiences and paid internships.\n\nBFI is a part of the National Academy Foundation's Academy of Finance. This foundation assists in establishing an ongoing relationship that involves corporate executives, school personnel, parents, and students, and results in paid internships, scholarships, and employment opportunities. Students are provided opportunities to enter into paid internships with local financial service companies during the summer of their senior year, and many offers of part-time employment during the school year are provided.  BFI also has the Institute of Student Achievement (ISA) as its intermediary partner. This organization supports the school's planning process, curriculum development, leadership development, and overall development of the small learning communities.\n\n===Washington Health, Science, and Nutrition===\nThe Booker T. Washington High School of Health Science and Nutrition (BTWHSN) provides an interdisciplinary curriculum with a healthcare and nutrition concentration through in-depth investigation, hands-on discovery, experimentation, and inquiry-based learning. Through a four-year program of study, students have the opportunity to:\n\n* Undergo a rigorous and relevant curriculum and receive in-depth instruction designed to ensure that all students meet the graduation requirements of the Atlanta Public Schools system while affording them multiple opportunities for postsecondary study.\n* Gain college credit through dual enrollment and advanced placement courses.\n* Explore career interest in various nutrition and health care-related fields.\n* Gain invaluable knowledge, skills, and experiences through medical seminars, internships, and health science field trips.\n* Partake in an array of shadowing opportunities and hands-on modules.\n\nBooker T.

He also had a prominent place in the ceremonies for [[Russian tsar#Russia|Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]'s coronation and later had several private meetings with the Tsar. After the Bolshevik revolution, Finland declared its independence but was soon embroiled in [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]] between the pro-Bolshevik \"[[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic|Reds]]\" and the \"[[Whites (Finland)|Whites]]\", who were the troops of the [[Senate of Finland]], supported by troops of the [[German Empire]]. Mannerheim was appointed the military chief of the Whites.

The Finnish parliament appointed [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]] to lead the newly-independent grand duchy's [[interregnum]] government. In January 1918, a Military committee was charged with bolstering the Finnish army, then not much more than some locally organised [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]]. Mannerheim was appointed to the committee, but soon resigned to protest its indecision. On 13 January he was given command of the army.{{hsp}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Screen |first1=J. E.

His raw recruits had few arms. Nonetheless he marched them to [[Vaasa]], which was garrisoned by 42,500 Russians.{{hsp}}<ref>Mannerheim 1954, p. 138.</ref> He surrounded the Russian garrison with a mass of men; the defenders could not see that only the front rank was armed, so they surrendered, providing badly needed arms.

Mannerheim's rapport with the Allies was recognized in October 1918 when the Finnish government sent him to Britain and France to attempt to gain Britain's and the United States's recognition of Finland's independence. In December, he was summoned back to Finland; Frederick Charles had renounced the throne, and in his stead, Mannerheim had been elected [[Regent]] of the nascent kingdom. As Regent, Mannerheim often signed official documents using ''Kustaa'', the Finnish form of his Christian name, to emphasize his Finnishness to those who were suspicious of his background in the Russian armed forces, and his difficulties with the Finnish language{{hsp}}{{sfnp|Jagerskiold|1986}} Mannerheim disliked his last Christian name, Emil, and wrote his signature as C.G.

This was largely due to his being seen by many politicians of the centre and left as a controversial figure for his ruthless battle with the [[Bolshevik]]s, his supposed desire for Finnish intervention on the side of the [[White Army|Whites]] during the [[Russian Civil War]], and the Finnish socialists' antipathy toward him. They saw him as the [[bourgeois]] \"White General\". Mannerheim doubted that modern party-based politics would produce principled and high-quality leaders in Finland or elsewhere.

In 1933, Mannerheim received the rank of [[Field Marshal (Finland)|Field Marshal]] (''sotamarsalkka'', ''f\u00e4ltmarskalk''). By this time, Mannerheim had come to be seen by the public, including some former socialists, less as a \"White General\" and more as a nonpartisan figure, enhanced by his public statements urging reconciliation between the opposing sides in the Civil War and the need to focus on national unity and defence: \"we need not ask where a man stood fifteen years ago\".{{hsp}}<ref>Screen 2000, p. 112.</ref> Mannerheim supported Finland's military industry and sought in vain to obtain a military defence union with [[Sweden]].

They retook the Finnish territories annexed by the Soviet Union after the Winter War{{hsp}},<ref>Mannerheim 1954, p. 456.</ref> and went further occupying [[Finnish conquest of East Karelia (1941)|East Karelia]]. Finnish troops didn't take part in the [[Siege of Leningrad]], which lasted 872 days.\n\n==Visit by Adolf Hitler== <!-- Downfall (film) links here -->\n[[File:Hitler Mannerheim Ryti.jpg|thumb|right|Discussion with Hitler, [[Field Marshal (Finland)|Marshal]] Mannerheim and President [[Risto Ryti|Ryti]]. Hitler visited Mannerheim on his 75th birthday.]]\n\nMannerheim's 75th birthday, 4 June 1942, was a national celebration. The government granted him the unique title of [[Marshal of Finland]] (''Suomen Marsalkka'' in Finnish, ''Marskalk av Finland'' in Swedish). So far he is the only person to receive the title. A surprise birthday visit by Hitler occurred on the day as he wished to visit the \"brave Finns (''die tapferen Finnen'')\" and their leader Mannerheim.{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Virkkunen\" />{{sfnp|Turtola|1994}} Mannerheim did not want to meet him at his headquarters or in Helsinki, as then it would seem like an official state visit. The meeting took place near [[Imatra]], in south-eastern Finland, and was arranged in secrecy.{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/> From [[Immola Airfield]], Hitler, accompanied by President Ryti, was driven to where [[Baron]] Mannerheim was waiting at a railway siding. A speech from Hitler was followed by a birthday meal and negotiations between him and Mannerheim. Overall, Hitler spent about five hours in Finland; he reportedly asked the Finns to step up military operations against the Soviets, but apparently made no specific demands.{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/>\n\nDuring the visit, an engineer of the Finnish broadcasting company [[YLE]], Thor Damen, succeeded in recording the first eleven minutes of [[Hitler and Mannerheim recording|Hitler's and Mannerheim's private conversation]]. This had to be done secretly, as Hitler never allowed off-guard recordings. Damen was assigned to record the official birthday speeches and Mannerheim's response and therefore placed microphones in some of the railway cars. However, Mannerheim and his guests chose to go to a car that did not have a microphone in it. Damen acted quickly, pushing a microphone through one of the car windows onto a net shelf just above where Hitler and Mannerheim were sitting. After eleven minutes of Hitler's and Mannerheim's private conversation, Hitler's [[Begleitkommando-SS|SS bodyguards]] spotted the cords coming out of the window and realized that the Finnish engineer was recording the conversation. They gestured to him to stop recording immediately, and he complied. The SS bodyguards demanded that the tape be destroyed, but YLE was allowed to keep the reel after promising to keep it in a sealed container. It was given to [[Kustaa Vilkuna]], head of the state censors' office, and in 1957 returned to [[Yle|YLE]]. It was released to the public a few years later. It is the only known recording of Hitler conversing.{{hsp}}<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/1076153999513 Helsingin Sanomat International Web-Edition] \u2013 \"Conversation secretly recorded in Finland helped a German actor prepare for Hitler role\" Helsingin Sanomat / First published in print 15 September 2004 in Finnish.</ref><ref>Recording available [[YLE]]'s [http://www.yle.fi/elavaarkisto/?s=s&g=1&ag=3&t=22&a=376 web-archive]</ref>\n\nThere is an unsubstantiated story that while conversing with Hitler, Mannerheim lit a cigar. Mannerheim expected that Hitler would ask Finland for more help against the [[Soviet Union]], which Mannerheim was unwilling to give. When Mannerheim lit up, all in attendance gasped, for [[Anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany|Hitler's aversion to smoking]] was well known. Nevertheless, Hitler continued the conversation calmly, with no comment. By this test, Mannerheim could judge if Hitler was speaking from a position of strength or weakness. He refused Hitler, knowing that Hitler was in a weak position, and could not dictate to him.{{hsp}}<ref name=Virkkunen />{{sfnp|Turtola|1994}}\n\nShortly thereafter, Mannerheim returned the visit, traveling to Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia.{{hsp}}<ref>Mannerheim 1954, pp. 454\u2013455.</ref>\n\n===End of war and presidency===\n[[File:Mannerheim Leaving Presidents Residence.png|thumb|left|[[Marshal of Finland|Marshal]] [[Baron]] Mannerheim leaves the [[Presidential Palace, Helsinki|Presidential Palace]] in [[Helsinki]] on 4 March 1946 after his short presidency]]\n\nIn June 1944, Baron Gustaf Mannerheim, to ensure German support while a major Soviet offensive was threatening Finland, thought it necessary to agree to the pact the German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] demanded. But even then Mannerheim distanced himself from the pact, and it fell to President [[Risto Ryti]] to sign it, so it came to be known as the [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement]]. This allowed Mannerheim to revoke the agreement upon the resignation of President Ryti at the start of August 1944. Mannerheim succeeded Ryti as president.<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/><ref name=Zetterberg>Seppo Zetterberg et al., eds., \"A Small Giant of Finnish History\" ''(Suomen historian pikkuj\u00e4ttil\u00e4inen),'' 2003</ref>\n\nWhen Germany was deemed sufficiently weakened, and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s summer offensive was fought to a standstill (see [[Battle of Tali-Ihantala]]) thanks to the June agreement with the Germans, Finland's leaders saw a chance to reach a peace with the Soviet Union.{{hsp}}<ref>Screen 2000, p. 205.</ref> At first, attempts were made to persuade Mannerheim to become prime minister, but he rejected them because of his age and lack of experience running a civil government. The next suggestion was to elect him [[Head of State]]. Risto Ryti would resign as President, and parliament would appoint Mannerheim as Regent. The use of the title \"Regent\" would have reflected the exceptional circumstances of Mannerheim's election. Mannerheim and Ryti both agreed, and Ryti submitted a notice of resignation on 1 August. The [[Parliament of Finland]] passed a special act conferring the presidency on Mannerheim on 4 August 1944. He took the oath of office the same day.<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/><ref name=\"Zetterberg\"/>\n\nA month after Mannerheim took office, the [[Continuation War]] was concluded on harsh terms, but ultimately far less harsh than those imposed on the other states bordering the [[Soviet Union]]. Finland retained its sovereignty, its parliamentary democracy, and its market economy. Territorial losses were considerable; all [[Karelia]] and [[Petsamo Province|Petsamo]] were lost. Numerous [[Karelia]]n refugees needed to be relocated. The war reparations were very heavy. Finland also had to fight the [[Lapland War]] against withdrawing German troops in the north, and at the same time demobilize its own army, making it harder to expel the Germans.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C68xN5lTN6EC&pg=PA87 | author=Kinnunen et al, eds.| title=Finland in World War II: History, Memory, Interpretations |year=2011 | page=87 | accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref> It is widely agreed that only Mannerheim could have guided Finland through these difficult times, when the Finnish people had to come to terms with the severe conditions of the armistice, their implementation by a Soviet-dominated [[Allied Control Commission]], and the task of post-war reconstruction.<ref name=\"Zetterberg\"/>\n\nBefore deciding to accept the Soviet demands, Mannerheim wrote a missive directly to Hitler:<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nenye|first1=Vesa|last2=Munter|first2=Peter|last3=Wirtanen|first3=Toni|last4=Birks|first4=Chris|title=Finland at War: the Continuation and Lapland Wars 1941\u201345|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zb6gCwAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=1472815262}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Our German brothers-in-arms will forever remain in our hearts. The Germans in Finland were certainly not the representatives of foreign despotism but helpers and brothers-in-arms. But even in such cases foreigners are in difficult positions requiring such tact. I can assure you that during the past years nothing whatsoever happened that could have induced us to consider the German troops intruders or oppressors. I believe that the attitude of the German Army in northern Finland towards the local population and authorities will enter our history as a unique example of a correct and cordial relationship ... I deem it my duty to lead my people out of the war. I cannot and I will not turn the arms which you have so liberally supplied us against Germans. I harbour the hope that you, even if you disapprove of my attitude, will wish and endeavour like myself and all other Finns to terminate our former relations without increasing the gravity of the situation.}}\n\nMannerheim's term as president was difficult for him. Although he was elected for a full six-year term, he was 77 years old in 1944 and had accepted the office reluctantly after being urged to do so. The situation was exacerbated by frequent periods of ill-health, the demands of the Allied Control Commission, and the [[War-responsibility trials in Finland|war responsibility trials]]. He was afraid throughout most of his presidency that the commission would request that he be prosecuted for [[crimes against peace]]. This never happened. One of the reasons for this was Stalin's respect for and admiration of the Marshal. Stalin told a Finnish delegation in Moscow in 1947 that the Finns owe much to their old Marshal. Due to Mannerheim, Finland was not occupied.{{sfnp|Meri|1990|page=397}} Despite Mannerheim's criticisms of some of the demands of the Control Commission, he worked hard to carry out Finland's armistice obligations. He also emphasised the necessity of further work on reconstruction in Finland after the war.<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/><ref name=\"Zetterberg\"/>\n\nMannerheim was troubled by recurring health problems during 1945, and was absent on medical leave from his duties as president from November until February 1946. He spent six weeks in Portugal to restore his health. After the announcement of the verdicts in the war crimes trials in February, Mannerheim decided to resign. He believed that he had accomplished the duties he had been elected to carry out: The war was ended, the armistice obligations carried out, and war responsibility trials finished.\n\nMannerheim resigned as president on 11 March 1946, giving as his reason his declining health and his view that the tasks he had been selected to carry out had been accomplished. Even the Finnish communists, his enemies in 1918, appreciated his efforts and his role in maintaining the unity of the country during a difficult period.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} He was succeeded as president by the conservative Prime Minister [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi]].{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Zetterberg\"/>\n\n==Final days and death==\n[[File:Mannerheims funeral parade Helsinki.png|thumb|Mannerheim's funeral parade in Helsinki [[Helsinki Senate Square|Senate Square]] on 4 February 1951.]]\nAfter his resignation, [[Marshal of Finland|Marshal]] [[Baron]] Mannerheim bought Kirkniemi Manor in [[Lohja]], intending to spend his retirement there. In June 1946, he underwent an operation for a perforated [[peptic ulcer]], and in October of that year he was diagnosed with a [[duodenal ulcer]]. In early 1947, it was recommended that he should travel to the Valmont Sanatorium in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]], to recuperate and write his memoirs. Valmont was to be Mannerheim's main residence for the remainder of his life, although he regularly returned to Finland, and also visited Sweden, France and Italy.<ref>Screen 2000, p. 245.</ref>\n\nBecause Mannerheim was old and sickly, he personally wrote only certain passages of his memoirs. Some other parts he dictated. The remaining parts were written from his recollections by Mannerheim's various assistants, such as Colonel Alad\u00e1r Paasonen; General Erik Heinrichs; Generals Grandell, Olenius and Martola; and Colonel Viljanen, a war historian. As long as Mannerheim was able to read, he proofread the typewritten drafts of his memoirs. He was almost totally silent about his private life, and focused instead on Finland's history, especially between 1917 and 1944. When Mannerheim suffered a fatal [[bowel obstruction]] in January 1951,{{hsp}}<ref>Screen 2000, p. 252.</ref> his memoirs were not yet in their finished form. They were published after his death.{{hsp}}{{sfnp|J\u00e4gerski\u00f6ld|1983}}\n\nMannerheim died on 27 January 1951 (28 January Finland time), in the Cantonal Hospital in [[Lausanne]] ({{Lang-fr|L'H\u00f4pital cantonal \u00e0 Lausanne}}; modern [[Lausanne University Hospital]]{{hsp}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chuv.ch/fr/chuv-home/en-bref/historique/|title=Historique|website=Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois|access-date=2018-02-24}}</ref>), Switzerland. He was buried on 4 February 1951 in the [[Hietaniemi Cemetery]] in [[Helsinki]] in a [[state funeral]] with full military honours.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Mannerheimin aukio.jpg|thumb|right|Mannerheim Square in Helsinki with an [[equestrian statue]] of Mannerheim.]]\nToday, Mannerheim retains respect as Finland's greatest [[wikt:statesman|statesman]]. This may be partly due to his refusal to enter partisan politics (although his sympathies were more right-wing than left-wing), his claim always to serve the fatherland without selfish motives, his personal courage in visiting the frontlines, his ability to work diligently into his late seventies, and his foreign political farsightedness in preparing for the Soviet invasion of Finland years before it occurred.<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/>\n\nMannerheim's birthday, 4 June, is celebrated as Flag Day by the [[Finnish Defence Forces]]. This decision was made by the Finnish government on the occasion of his 75th birthday in 1942, when he was also granted the title of [[Field marshal (Finland)|Marshal of Finland]]. Flag Day is celebrated with a national parade, and rewards and promotions for members of the defence forces. The life and times of Mannerheim are memorialized in the [[Mannerheim Museum]].<ref name=Museum/> The most prominent boulevard in the Finnish capital was renamed [[Mannerheimintie]] (Mannerheim Road) in the Marshal's honour during his lifetime.\n\nVarious landmarks across Finland honor Mannerheim, including most famously the [[Equestrian statue of Marshal Mannerheim|Equestrian statue]] located on Helsinki's Mannerheimintie in front of the later-built [[Kiasma]] museum of modern art. Turku's Mannerheim Park includes a statue of him. Tampere's Mannerheim statue depicting the victorious Civil War general of the Whites was eventually placed in the forest some kilometres outside the city (in part due to lingering controversy over Mannerheim's Civil War role). Other statues, for examples, were erected in Mikkeli and Lahti.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=625 | title=Mannerheim, Gustaf (1867\u20131951) President of Finland, Marshal of Finland | author=Matti Klinge, transl.

The Finnish parliament appointed [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud]] to lead the newly-independent grand duchy's [[interregnum]] government. In January 1918, a Military committee was charged with bolstering the Finnish army, then not much more than some locally organised [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]]. Mannerheim was appointed to the committee, but soon resigned to protest its indecision. On 13 January he was given command of the army.{{hsp}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Screen |first1=J. E.

The Finnish red guard had 30,000 men and there were 70,000 Russian troops in Finland. His army was financed by a fifteen million mark line of credit provided by the bankers. His raw recruits had few arms. Nonetheless he marched them to [[Vaasa]], which was garrisoned by 42,500 Russians.{{hsp}}<ref>Mannerheim 1954, p. 138.</ref> He surrounded the Russian garrison with a mass of men; the defenders could not see that only the front rank was armed, so they surrendered, providing badly needed arms. Further weapons were purchased from Germany. Eighty-four Swedish officers and 200 Swedish NCOs served in the [[Finnish Civil War]] (or War of Liberty, as it was known among the \"Whites\"). Other officers were Finns who had been trained by the Germans as a J\u00e4ger Battalion. In March 1918 they were aided by German troops landing in Finland and occupying [[Helsinki]].\n\nAfter the Whites' victory in the bitterly fought [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]], during which both sides employed ruthless terror tactics, Mannerheim resigned as commander-in-chief.

Mannerheim's rapport with the Allies was recognized in October 1918 when the Finnish government sent him to Britain and France to attempt to gain Britain's and the United States's recognition of Finland's independence. In December, he was summoned back to Finland; Frederick Charles had renounced the throne, and in his stead, Mannerheim had been elected [[Regent]] of the nascent kingdom. As Regent, Mannerheim often signed official documents using ''Kustaa'', the Finnish form of his Christian name, to emphasize his Finnishness to those who were suspicious of his background in the Russian armed forces, and his difficulties with the Finnish language{{hsp}}{{sfnp|Jagerskiold|1986}} Mannerheim disliked his last Christian name, Emil, and wrote his signature as C.G.

In July 1919, after he had confirmed a new, [[Republicanism|republican]] constitution, Mannerheim stood as a candidate in [[1919 Finnish presidential election|the first presidential election]], with parliament as the electors. He was supported by the [[National Coalition Party]] and the [[Swedish People's Party (Finland)|Swedish People's Party]]. He finished second to [[Kaarlo Juho St\u00e5hlberg]], and withdrew from public life.{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Putensen\"/>\n\n===Interwar period===\nIn the interwar years, Mannerheim held no public office. This was largely due to his being seen by many politicians of the centre and left as a controversial figure for his ruthless battle with the [[Bolshevik]]s, his supposed desire for Finnish intervention on the side of the [[White Army|Whites]] during the [[Russian Civil War]], and the Finnish socialists' antipathy toward him. They saw him as the [[bourgeois]] \"White General\". Mannerheim doubted that modern party-based politics would produce principled and high-quality leaders in Finland or elsewhere. In his gloomy opinion, the fatherland's interests were too often sacrificed by the democratic politicians for partisan benefit.{{hsp}}<ref>{{cite book |last1=Virkkunen |first1=Sakari |title=Mannerheimin k\u00e4\u00e4nt\u00f6puoli |date=1992 |publisher=Otava |location=Helsingiss\u00e4}}</ref>{{hsp}}{{sfnp|J\u00e4gerski\u00f6ld|1983}}\n\nHe kept busy heading the Finnish [[Red Cross]] (Chairman 1919\u20131951), was a member of the board of the International Red Cross, and founded the Mannerheim League for Child Welfare.

In 1933, Mannerheim received the rank of [[Field Marshal (Finland)|Field Marshal]] (''sotamarsalkka'', ''f\u00e4ltmarskalk''). By this time, Mannerheim had come to be seen by the public, including some former socialists, less as a \"White General\" and more as a nonpartisan figure, enhanced by his public statements urging reconciliation between the opposing sides in the Civil War and the need to focus on national unity and defence: \"we need not ask where a man stood fifteen years ago\".{{hsp}}<ref>Screen 2000, p. 112.</ref> Mannerheim supported Finland's military industry and sought in vain to obtain a military defence union with [[Sweden]]. However, rearming the Finnish army did not occur as swiftly or as well as he hoped, and he was not enthusiastic about a war. He had many disagreements with various Cabinets, and signed many letters of resignation.{{hsp}}<ref name=Virkkunen >Sakari Virkkunen, \"Presidents of Finland II\" ''(Suomen presidentit II)'', published in Finland in 1994</ref>{{hsp}}{{sfnp|Turtola|1994}}\n\n===Commander-in-Chief===\n{{See also|Winter War|Continuation War|Lapland War}}\n[[File:Talvisoda marski-2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Field Marshal (Finland)|Field Marshal]] [[Baron]] Mannerheim in 1940]]\n\nWhen negotiations with the Soviet Union failed in 1939, Mannerheim withdrew his resignation on 17 October.

Hitler visited Mannerheim on his 75th birthday.]]\n\nMannerheim's 75th birthday, 4 June 1942, was a national celebration. The government granted him the unique title of [[Marshal of Finland]] (''Suomen Marsalkka'' in Finnish, ''Marskalk av Finland'' in Swedish). So far he is the only person to receive the title. A surprise birthday visit by Hitler occurred on the day as he wished to visit the \"brave Finns (''die tapferen Finnen'')\" and their leader Mannerheim.{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Virkkunen\" />{{sfnp|Turtola|1994}} Mannerheim did not want to meet him at his headquarters or in Helsinki, as then it would seem like an official state visit. The meeting took place near [[Imatra]], in south-eastern Finland, and was arranged in secrecy.{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/> From [[Immola Airfield]], Hitler, accompanied by President Ryti, was driven to where [[Baron]] Mannerheim was waiting at a railway siding. A speech from Hitler was followed by a birthday meal and negotiations between him and Mannerheim. Overall, Hitler spent about five hours in Finland; he reportedly asked the Finns to step up military operations against the Soviets, but apparently made no specific demands.{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/>\n\nDuring the visit, an engineer of the Finnish broadcasting company [[YLE]], Thor Damen, succeeded in recording the first eleven minutes of [[Hitler and Mannerheim recording|Hitler's and Mannerheim's private conversation]]. This had to be done secretly, as Hitler never allowed off-guard recordings. Damen was assigned to record the official birthday speeches and Mannerheim's response and therefore placed microphones in some of the railway cars. However, Mannerheim and his guests chose to go to a car that did not have a microphone in it. Damen acted quickly, pushing a microphone through one of the car windows onto a net shelf just above where Hitler and Mannerheim were sitting. After eleven minutes of Hitler's and Mannerheim's private conversation, Hitler's [[Begleitkommando-SS|SS bodyguards]] spotted the cords coming out of the window and realized that the Finnish engineer was recording the conversation. They gestured to him to stop recording immediately, and he complied. The SS bodyguards demanded that the tape be destroyed, but YLE was allowed to keep the reel after promising to keep it in a sealed container. It was given to [[Kustaa Vilkuna]], head of the state censors' office, and in 1957 returned to [[Yle|YLE]]. It was released to the public a few years later. It is the only known recording of Hitler conversing.{{hsp}}<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/1076153999513 Helsingin Sanomat International Web-Edition] \u2013 \"Conversation secretly recorded in Finland helped a German actor prepare for Hitler role\" Helsingin Sanomat / First published in print 15 September 2004 in Finnish.</ref><ref>Recording available [[YLE]]'s [http://www.yle.fi/elavaarkisto/?s=s&g=1&ag=3&t=22&a=376 web-archive]</ref>\n\nThere is an unsubstantiated story that while conversing with Hitler, Mannerheim lit a cigar. Mannerheim expected that Hitler would ask Finland for more help against the [[Soviet Union]], which Mannerheim was unwilling to give. When Mannerheim lit up, all in attendance gasped, for [[Anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany|Hitler's aversion to smoking]] was well known. Nevertheless, Hitler continued the conversation calmly, with no comment. By this test, Mannerheim could judge if Hitler was speaking from a position of strength or weakness. He refused Hitler, knowing that Hitler was in a weak position, and could not dictate to him.{{hsp}}<ref name=Virkkunen />{{sfnp|Turtola|1994}}\n\nShortly thereafter, Mannerheim returned the visit, traveling to Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia.{{hsp}}<ref>Mannerheim 1954, pp. 454\u2013455.</ref>\n\n===End of war and presidency===\n[[File:Mannerheim Leaving Presidents Residence.png|thumb|left|[[Marshal of Finland|Marshal]] [[Baron]] Mannerheim leaves the [[Presidential Palace, Helsinki|Presidential Palace]] in [[Helsinki]] on 4 March 1946 after his short presidency]]\n\nIn June 1944, Baron Gustaf Mannerheim, to ensure German support while a major Soviet offensive was threatening Finland, thought it necessary to agree to the pact the German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] demanded. But even then Mannerheim distanced himself from the pact, and it fell to President [[Risto Ryti]] to sign it, so it came to be known as the [[Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement]]. This allowed Mannerheim to revoke the agreement upon the resignation of President Ryti at the start of August 1944. Mannerheim succeeded Ryti as president.<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/><ref name=Zetterberg>Seppo Zetterberg et al., eds., \"A Small Giant of Finnish History\" ''(Suomen historian pikkuj\u00e4ttil\u00e4inen),'' 2003</ref>\n\nWhen Germany was deemed sufficiently weakened, and the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s summer offensive was fought to a standstill (see [[Battle of Tali-Ihantala]]) thanks to the June agreement with the Germans, Finland's leaders saw a chance to reach a peace with the Soviet Union.{{hsp}}<ref>Screen 2000, p. 205.</ref> At first, attempts were made to persuade Mannerheim to become prime minister, but he rejected them because of his age and lack of experience running a civil government. The next suggestion was to elect him [[Head of State]]. Risto Ryti would resign as President, and parliament would appoint Mannerheim as Regent. The use of the title \"Regent\" would have reflected the exceptional circumstances of Mannerheim's election. Mannerheim and Ryti both agreed, and Ryti submitted a notice of resignation on 1 August.

Numerous [[Karelia]]n refugees needed to be relocated. The war reparations were very heavy.

Although he was elected for a full six-year term, he was 77 years old in 1944 and had accepted the office reluctantly after being urged to do so. The situation was exacerbated by frequent periods of ill-health, the demands of the Allied Control Commission, and the [[War-responsibility trials in Finland|war responsibility trials]]. He was afraid throughout most of his presidency that the commission would request that he be prosecuted for [[crimes against peace]]. This never happened. One of the reasons for this was Stalin's respect for and admiration of the Marshal. Stalin told a Finnish delegation in Moscow in 1947 that the Finns owe much to their old Marshal. Due to Mannerheim, Finland was not occupied.{{sfnp|Meri|1990|page=397}} Despite Mannerheim's criticisms of some of the demands of the Control Commission, he worked hard to carry out Finland's armistice obligations.

As long as Mannerheim was able to read, he proofread the typewritten drafts of his memoirs.

He was buried on 4 February 1951 in the [[Hietaniemi Cemetery]] in [[Helsinki]] in a [[state funeral]] with full military honours.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Mannerheimin aukio.jpg|thumb|right|Mannerheim Square in Helsinki with an [[equestrian statue]] of Mannerheim.]]\nToday, Mannerheim retains respect as Finland's greatest [[wikt:statesman|statesman]]. This may be partly due to his refusal to enter partisan politics (although his sympathies were more right-wing than left-wing), his claim always to serve the fatherland without selfish motives, his personal courage in visiting the frontlines, his ability to work diligently into his late seventies, and his foreign political farsightedness in preparing for the Soviet invasion of Finland years before it occurred.<ref name=\"Virkkunen\"/>\n\nMannerheim's birthday, 4 June, is celebrated as Flag Day by the [[Finnish Defence Forces]]. This decision was made by the Finnish government on the occasion of his 75th birthday in 1942, when he was also granted the title of [[Field marshal (Finland)|Marshal of Finland]]. Flag Day is celebrated with a national parade, and rewards and promotions for members of the defence forces. The life and times of Mannerheim are memorialized in the [[Mannerheim Museum]].<ref name=Museum/> The most prominent boulevard in the Finnish capital was renamed [[Mannerheimintie]] (Mannerheim Road) in the Marshal's honour during his lifetime.\n\nVarious landmarks across Finland honor Mannerheim, including most famously the [[Equestrian statue of Marshal Mannerheim|Equestrian statue]] located on Helsinki's Mannerheimintie in front of the later-built [[Kiasma]] museum of modern art. Turku's Mannerheim Park includes a statue of him. Tampere's Mannerheim statue depicting the victorious Civil War general of the Whites was eventually placed in the forest some kilometres outside the city (in part due to lingering controversy over Mannerheim's Civil War role). Other statues, for examples, were erected in Mikkeli and Lahti.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=625 | title=Mannerheim, Gustaf (1867\u20131951) President of Finland, Marshal of Finland | author=Matti Klinge, transl.

and in 1960 the United States honoured Mannerheim as the \"Liberator of Finland\" with regular first-class envelope domestic and international stamps (at the time four cents and eight cents respectively) as part of its Champions of Liberty series that included other notable figures such as [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Simon Bolivar]].{{hsp}}<ref name=\"Mannerheim.fi Stamps Special Topics\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mannerheim.fi/13_erity/e_postim.htm|title=MANNERHEIM \u2013 Special Topics \u2013 Stamps|website=www.mannerheim.fi}}</ref><ref name=\"Arago People, Postage and the Post \u2013 Rod Juell\">{{cite web | url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=1&cmd=1&tid=2035645 | title=8-cent Mannerheim | date=12 December 2008 | accessdate=18 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Gandhi Philately Study Circle\">{{cite web | url=http://gandhiphilately.blogspot.com/2011/03/50th-anniversary-of-usa-mahatma-gandhi.html | title=50th Anniversary USA Champions of Liberty Mahatma Gandhi Stamp | date=9 March 2011 | accessdate=18 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Military ranks==\n[[File:Mannerheim-50p-1941.jpg|thumb|120px|Finnish postal stamp 1941]]\n\n===Ranks===\n\n====In the Russian Army====\n* 1888: [[Non-commissioned officer]]\n* 1889: [[Cornet (rank)|Cornet]]\n* 1891: Cornet of the Guard\n* 1893: Lieutenant of the Guard\n* 1902: Captain of the Guard\n* 1904: [[Lieutenant Colonel]]\n* 1905: [[Colonel]]\n* 1911: [[Major General]]\n* 1917: [[Lieutenant General]]\n\n====In the Finnish Army====\n* 1918: General of Cavalry\n* 1933: [[Field Marshal (Finland)|Field Marshal]]\n* 1942: [[Marshal of Finland]]\n<!---===Postings===\n* 1889: 15th ''Alexandrijski'' Dragoon Regiment [1889\u20131891]\n* 1891: Her Majesty Maria Feodorovna's Chevalier Guards [1891\u20131904]\n* 1897: Imperial Court Stables Administration [1897\u20131903]\n* 1903: Squadron Commander of the Demonstration Squadron of the Cavalry School [1903\u20131904]\n* 1904: 52nd ''Nezhin'' Dragoon Regiment [1904\u20131909]\n* 1909: Commander, 13th ''Vladimir'' Lancer Regiment\n* 1911: Commander, His Majesty's Life Guard Lancer Regiment\n* 1913: Commander, the Separate Guards Cavalry Brigade\n* 1917: Commander, 12th Cavalry Division\n* 1917: Commander, 6th Cavalry Corps--->\n\n===Supreme Command===\n* 1918: [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guard]]: from January to May 1918\n* 1918: Commander-in-Chief of the [[Finnish Defence Forces]]: from December 1918 to July 1919\n* 1931: Chairman of the Defence Council: from 1931 to 1939\n* 1939: Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defence Forces [''bis'']: from 1939 to 1946\n\n==Awards==\n{{Infobox coat of arms\n|name             = Coat of Arms of Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim\n|image            =Freiherr Mannerheim coat of arms.svg\n|alt              = \n|image_width      = \n|middle           = \n|middle_width     =90\n|middle_caption   = \n|lesser           =\n|lesser_alt       = \n|lesser_width     =45\n|lesser_caption   = Coat of arms\n|image2           = \n|image2_alt       = \n|image2_width     = \n|image2_caption   = \n|image3           = \n|image3_alt       = \n|image3_width     = \n|image3_caption   = \n|armiger          = Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim\n|year_adopted     =\n|crest            = \n|torse            = \n|shield           = \n|supporters       = \n|compartment      = \n|motto            = ''\"Candida pro causa ense candido\"<ref>http://www.mannerheim-museo.fi/gustaf-mannerheim-3/</ref>(\"With an honourable sword for an honourable cause\")\n|orders           = \n|other_elements   = \n|earlier_versions = \n|use              = \n|notes            = \n}}\nIn the course of his lifetime, Mannerheim received 82 military and civilian decorations.<ref>[http://www.mannerheim.fi/13_erity/kunnmerk.htm Mannerheim Internetprojekti, kunniamerkit valokuvineen] (Finnish)</ref>\n\n[[File:Mannerheim on US stamp, Champion of Liberty.jpg|thumb|upright|Mannerheim was honoured by the US Mail with a postage stamp]]\n\n;Finland\n* {{flagicon|Finland}} Commander Grand Cross with Swords and Diamonds of the [[Order of the Cross of Liberty]] (1940;

After his forces left the [[Papal States]], Charles V [[Siege of Vienna (1529)|defended Vienna]] from the Turks and obtained the coronation as [[King of Italy|King in Italy]] by [[Pope Clement VII]]. In 1535, he annexed the vacant [[Duchy of Milan]] and [[Conquest of Tunis (1535)|captured Tunis]]. Nevertheless, the [[Algiers expedition (1541)|Algiers expedition]] and the [[Siege of Buda (1541)|loss of Buda]] in the early 40s frustrated his anti-Ottoman policies. Meanwhile, Charles V had come to an agreement with [[Pope Paul III]] for the organisation of the [[Council of Trent]] (1545). The refusal of the Lutheran [[Schmalkaldic League]] to recognize the Council's validity led to [[Schmalkaldic War|a war]], won by Charles V with the imprisonment of the Protestant princes.

At the death of Philip in 1506, Charles was recognized [[Lord of the Netherlands]] with the title of ''Charles II of Burgundy''. During Charles's childhood and teen years, [[William de Cro\u00ff]] (later prime minister) and Adrian of Utrecht (later [[Pope Adrian VI]]) served as his tutors. The culture and courtly life of the Low Countries played an important part in the development of Charles's beliefs. As a member of the Burgundian [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] in his infancy, and later its grandmaster, Charles was educated to the ideals of the medieval knights and the desire for Christian unity to fight the infidel.<ref>{{cite book| last=Heath| first=Richard| title=Charles V: Duty and Dynasty \u2013 The Emperor and his Changing World 1500\u20131558| year=2018|page=23| isbn=978-1-725-85278-5}}</ref> The Low Countries were very rich during his reign, both [[History of capitalism|economically]] and [[Flemish art|culturally]]. Charles was very attached to his homeland and spent much of his life in [[Brussels]].\n\n[[File:Jakob Seisenegger 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[Jakob Seisenegger]], 1533]]\n\nThe Spanish inheritance, resulting from a [[dynastic union]] of the crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]], included [[Spain]] as well as the Castilian [[West Indies]] and the Aragonese [[Two Sicilies]]. Joanna inherited these territories in 1516 in a condition of mental illness. Charles, therefore, claimed the crowns for himself ''[[jure matris]]'', thus becoming co-monarch of Joanna with the title of ''Charles I of Castile and Aragon'' or ''Charles I of Spain''.  Castile and Aragon together formed the largest of Charles's personal possessions, and they also provided a great number of generals and [[tercios]] (the formidable Spanish infantry of the time). However, at his accession to the throne, Charles was viewed as a foreign prince. Two rebellions, the [[revolt of the Germanies]] and the [[revolt of the comuneros]], contested Charles's rule in the 1520s. Following these revolts, Charles placed Spanish counselors in a position of power and spent a considerable part of his life in Castile, including his final years in a monastery. Indeed, Charles's motto, ''[[Plus Ultra (motto)|Plus Ultra]]'' (''Further Beyond''), became the national motto of Spain and his heir, later Philip II, was born and raised in Castile. Nonetheless, many Spaniards believed that their resources (largely consisting of flows of silver from the Americas) were being used to sustain Imperial-Habsburg policies that were not in the country's interest.<ref>History of Spain, Joseph Perez</ref>\n\nCharles inherited the [[Austrian hereditary lands]] in 1519, as ''Charles I of Austria'', and obtained the election as Holy Roman Emperor against the candidacy of the French King. Since the Imperial election, he was known as ''Emperor Charles V'' even outside of Germany and the ''[[A.E.I.O.U.]]'' motto of the House of Austria acquired political significance. Despite the fact that he was elected as a German prince, Charles's staunch Catholicism in contrast to the growth of Lutheranism alienated him from various German princes who finally fought against him. Charles's presence in Germany was often marked by the organization of [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|imperial diet]]s to maintain religious unity. He was frequently in Northern Italy, often taking part in complicated negotiations with the [[Pope]]s to address the rise of Protestantism. It is important to note, though, that the German Catholics supported the Emperor. Charles had a close relationship with important German families, like the [[House of Nassau]], many of which were represented at his court in Brussels. Several German princes or noblemen accompanied him in his military campaigns against France or the Ottomans, and the bulk of his army was generally composed of German troops, especially the Imperial [[Landsknechte]].<ref>''Charles V'', Pierre Chaunu</ref><ref>''Germany in the Holy Roman Empire'', Whaley</ref>\n\nIt is said that Charles spoke several languages. He was fluent in [[French language|French]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], his native languages.

For the regency and governorship of the Austrian hereditary lands, Charles named his brother [[Ferdinand]] Archduke in the Austrian lands under his authority at the [[Diet of Worms]] (1521). Charles also agreed to favor the election of Ferdinand as [[King of the Romans]] in Germany, which took place [[Imperial election, 1531|in 1531]].

The latter territories lied within the Holy Roman Empire and its borders, but were formally divided between fiefs of the [[German kingdom]] and French fiefs such as Charles's birthplace of Flanders, a last remnant of what had been a powerful player in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. As he was a minor, his aunt [[Margaret of Austria (1480-1530)|Margaret of Austria]] (born as Archduchess of Austria and in both her marriages as the Dowager Princess of Asturias and Dowager Duchess of Savoy) acted as regent, as appointed by Emperor Maximilian until 1515. She soon found herself at war with France over the question of Charles's requirement to pay homage to the French king for Flanders, as his father had done. The outcome was that France relinquished its ancient claim on Flanders in 1528.\n\nFrom 1515 to 1523, Charles's government in the Netherlands also had to contend with the rebellion of [[Arumer Zwarte Hoop|Frisian peasants]] (led by [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] and [[Wijard Jelckama]]). The rebels were initially successful but after a series of defeats, the remaining leaders were captured and decapitated in 1523.\n\nCharles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of [[Tournaisis|Tournai]], [[County of Artois|Artois]], [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], and [[Guelders]]. The [[Seventeen Provinces]] had been unified by Charles's Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were [[fief]]s of either France or the Holy Roman Empire. In 1549, Charles issued a [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549|Pragmatic Sanction]], declaring the Low Countries to be a unified entity of which his family would be the heirs.<ref name=\"Kamen\">{{cite book| last = Kamen| first = Henry| year = 2005| title = Spain, 1469\u20131714: a society of conflict| edition = 3rd| publisher = Pearson Education| url = https://archive.org/details/spain14691714soc00kame| location = Harlow, United Kingdom| isbn = 0-582-78464-6| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Low Countries held an important place in the Empire. For Charles V personally, they were his home, the region where he was born and spent his childhood. Because of trade and industry and the wealth of the region's cities, the Low Countries also represented an important income for the Imperial treasury.\n\nThe Burgundian territories were generally loyal to Charles throughout his reign. The important city of Ghent [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)|rebelled]] in 1539 due to heavy tax payments demanded by Charles.

With Charles, government became more absolute, even though until his mother's death in 1555 Charles did not hold the full kingship of the country.\n\nSoon resistance to the Emperor arose because of heavy taxation to support foreign wars in which Castilians had little interest, and because Charles tended to select Flemings for high offices in Castile and America, ignoring Castilian candidates. The resistance culminated in the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]], which Charles suppressed. Immediately after crushing the Castilian revolt, Charles was confronted again with the hot issue of Navarre when King [[Henry II of Navarre|Henry II]] attempted to [[Spanish conquest of Navarre#1521 French-Navarrese expedition|reconquer the kingdom]]. Main military operations lasted until 1524, when [[Hondarribia]] surrendered to Charles's forces, but frequent cross-border clashes in the western Pyrenees only stopped in 1528 (Treaties of Madrid and Cambrai).\n\nAfter these events, Navarre remained a matter of domestic and international litigation still for a century (a French dynastic claim to the throne did not end until the [[July Revolution]] in 1830). Charles wanted his son and heir [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] to marry the heiress of Navarre, [[Jeanne d'Albret]]. Jeanne was instead forced to marry [[William, Duke of Julich-Cleves-Berg]], but that childless marriage was annulled after four years. She next married [[Antoine de Bourbon]], and both she and their son would oppose [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] in the French Wars of Religion.\n\nCastile became integrated into Charles's empire, and provided the bulk of the empire's financial resources as well as very effective military units.

As Holy Roman Emperor, Charles was sovereign in several states of northern Italy and had a claim to the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] (obtained in 1530). The [[Duchy of Milan]], however, was under French control. [[Early Modern France|France]] took Milan from the [[House of Sforza]] after victory against Switzerland at the [[Battle of Marignano]] in 1515. Imperial-Papal troops succeeded in re-installing the Sforza in Milan in 1521, in the context of an alliance between Charles V and Pope Leo X. A Franco-Swiss army was finally expelled from Lombardy at [[Battle of Bicocca|Bicocca]] a year later. Yet in 1524 Francis I of France retook the initiative, crossing into Lombardy where Milan, along with a number of other cities, once again fell to his attack. [[Pavia]] alone held out, and on 24 February 1525 (Charles's twenty-fifth birthday), Charles's forces led by [[Charles de Lannoy]] captured Francis and crushed his army in the [[Battle of Pavia]]. In 1535, [[Francesco II Sforza]] died without heirs and Charles V annexed the territory as a vacant Imperial state. Charles successfully held on to all of its Italian territories, though they were invaded again on multiple occasions during the [[Italian Wars]].\n\nIn addition, Habsburg trade in the Mediterranean was consistently disrupted by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1538 a [[Holy League (1538)|Holy League]] consisting of all the Italian states and the Spanish kingdoms was formed to drive the Ottomans back, but it was defeated at the [[Battle of Preveza (1538)|Battle of Preveza]]. Decisive naval victory eluded Charles; it would not be achieved until after Charles's death, at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571.\n\n===America===\nDuring Charles's reign, the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Castilian territories in the Americas]] were considerably extended by ''[[conquistador]]es'' like [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]]. They conquered the large [[Aztec]] and [[Inca]] empires and incorporated them into the Empire as the Viceroyalties of [[New Spain]] and [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] between 1519 and 1542. Combined with the circumnavigation of the globe by the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan expedition]] in 1522, these successes convinced Charles of his divine mission to become the leader of [[Christendom]], which still perceived a significant threat from Islam. The conquests also helped solidify Charles's rule by providing the state treasury with enormous amounts of [[bullion]]. As the conquistador [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]] observed, \"We came to serve God and his Majesty, to give light to those in darkness, and also to acquire that wealth which most men covet.\"<ref name=\"Prescott\">{{cite book| last =  Prescott| first =  William Hickling| year = 1873| title = History of the Conquest of Mexico, with a Preliminary View of Ancient Mexican Civilization, and the Life of the Conqueror, Hernando Cortes| edition = 3rd| publisher = Electronic Text Center, University of Virginia Library| url = http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/PreConq.html| isbn = 1-152-29570-5}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 August 1518 Charles issued a charter authorising the transportation of slaves direct from Africa to the Americas.

He was also the natural candidate of the [[Prince-elector|electors]] to succeed his grandfather as Holy Roman Emperor. After having paid huge bribes to the electors, he defeated the candidacies of [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], [[Francis I of France|Francis I, King of France]], and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII, King of England]]. The electors gave Charles the crown on 28 June 1519. On 26 October 1520 he was crowned in Germany and some ten years later, on [[Coronation of Charles V|22 February 1530]], he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Pope Clement VII]] in [[Bologna]], the last emperor to receive a papal coronation.<ref>William Maltby, ''The Reign of Charles V'' (St. Martin's Press, 2002)</ref><ref>Claims that he gained the imperial crown through bribery have been questioned.

They gained a strong foothold in the Empire's territories, and Charles was determined not to let this happen in the Netherlands. An [[inquisition]] was established as early as 1522. In 1550, the death penalty was introduced for all cases of unrepentant heresy. Political dissent was also firmly controlled, most notably in his place of birth, where Charles, assisted by the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]], personally suppressed the [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)|Revolt of Ghent]] in mid-February 1540.<ref name=\"Kamen\"/>\n\nCharles abdicated as emperor in 1556 in favour of his brother Ferdinand; however, due to lengthy debate and bureaucratic procedure, the Imperial Diet did not accept the abdication (and thus make it legally valid) until 24 February 1558. Up to that date, Charles continued to use the title of Emperor.\n\n====Wars with France====\n[[File:Truce of Nice 1538.jpg|thumb|Francis I and Charles V made peace at the [[Truce of Nice]] in 1538. Francis actually refused to meet Charles in person, and the treaty was signed in separate rooms.]]\n\nMuch of Charles's reign was taken up by conflicts with France, which found itself encircled by Charles's empire while it still maintained ambitions in Italy.  In 1520, Charles visited [[England]], where his aunt, [[Catherine of Aragon]], urged her husband, Henry VIII, to ally himself with the emperor. In 1508 Charles was nominated by Henry VII to the [[Order of the Garter]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Royal Collection \u2013 The Knights of the Garter under Henry VIII|url = http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/microsites/knightsofthegarter/MicroObject.asp?row=21&themeid=455&item=22|archive-url = https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20111206134156/http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/microsites/knightsofthegarter/MicroObject.asp?row=21&themeid=455&item=22|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2011-12-06|website = www.royalcollection.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}</ref> His [[Garter stall plate]] survives in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|Saint George's Chapel]].\n\nThe [[Italian War of 1521|first war]] with Charles's great nemesis [[Francis I of France]] began in 1521. Charles allied with England and [[Pope Leo X]] against the French and the Venetians, and was highly successful, driving the French out of [[Milan]] and defeating and capturing Francis at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525. To gain his freedom, Francis ceded [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to Charles in the [[Treaty of Madrid (1526)|Treaty of Madrid]], as well as renouncing his support of Henry II's claim over [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]].\n\n[[File:Emperor Charles V seated (Titian).jpg|thumb|left|Portrait, 1548, by [[Lambert Sustris]] (formerly attributed to [[Titian]])]]\n\nWhen he was released, however, Francis had the Parliament of Paris denounce the treaty because it had been signed under [[duress]]. France then joined the [[War of the League of Cognac|League of Cognac]] that [[Pope Clement VII]] had formed with Henry VIII of England, the Venetians, the Florentines, and the Milanese to resist imperial domination of Italy. In the ensuing war, Charles's [[sack of Rome (1527)]] and virtual imprisonment of Pope Clement VII in 1527 prevented the Pope from [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulling]] the marriage of Henry VIII of England and Charles's aunt [[Catherine of Aragon]], so Henry eventually broke with Rome, thus leading to the [[English Reformation]].<ref name=Holmes1993a>Holmes (1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BsV-qSRKAnAC&pg=PA192 p. 192]</ref><ref name=Froude1891a>Froude (1891), [https://books.google.com/books?id=n-Ecc8SnlC0C&pg=PA480 p. 35, pp. 90\u201391, pp. 96\u201397] Note: the link goes to page 480, then click the View All option</ref> In other respects, the war was inconclusive. In the [[Treaty of Cambrai]] (1529), called the \"Ladies' Peace\" because it was negotiated between Charles's aunt and Francis' mother, Francis renounced his claims in Italy but retained control of Burgundy.\n\nA [[Italian War of 1536\u201338|third war]] erupted in 1536. Following the death of [[Francesco II Sforza|the last Sforza Duke of Milan]], Charles installed his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]] in the duchy, despite Francis' claims on it. This war too was inconclusive. Francis failed to conquer Milan, but he succeeded in conquering most of the lands of Charles's ally, the [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]], including his capital [[Turin]]. A truce at [[Nice]] in 1538 on the basis of ''[[uti possidetis]]'' ended the war but lasted only a short time. [[Italian War of 1542\u201346|War resumed in 1542]], with Francis now allied with Ottoman Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] and Charles once again allied with Henry VIII. Despite the conquest of Nice by a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|Franco-Ottoman fleet]], the French could not advance toward Milan, while a joint Anglo-Imperial invasion of northern France, led by Charles himself, won some successes but was ultimately abandoned, leading to another peace and restoration of the ''status quo ante bellum'' in 1544.\n\nA [[Italian War of 1551\u20131559|final war]] erupted with Francis' son and successor, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], in 1551. Henry won early success in [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], where he captured [[Metz]], but French offensives in Italy failed. Charles abdicated midway through this conflict, leaving further conduct of the war to his son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], and his brother, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\n====Conflicts with the Ottoman Empire====\n{{Further|Protestantism and Islam|Habsburg-Persian alliance|Conquest of Tunis (1534)|conquest of Tunis (1535)}}\n\nCharles fought continually with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its sultan, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. The defeat of Hungary at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526 \"sent a wave of terror over Europe.\"<ref>Quoted from: [[Bryan W. Ball]]. ''A Great Expectation''.

However, by 1541, central and southern Hungary fell under Turkish control.\n\nSuleiman won the contest for mastery of the Mediterranean, in spite of Christian victories such as the [[Conquest of Tunis (1535)|conquest of Tunis]] in 1535. The regular Ottoman fleet came to dominate the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] after its victories at [[Battle of Preveza|Preveza]] in 1538 and [[Battle of Djerba|Djerba]] in 1560 (shortly after Charles's death), which severely decimated the Spanish marine arm. At the same time, the Muslim [[Barbary corsairs]], acting under the general authority and supervision of the sultan, regularly devastated the Spanish and Italian coasts, crippling Spanish trade and chipping at the foundations of Habsburg power.\n\nIn 1536 [[Francis I of France]] allied himself with Suleiman against Charles. While Francis was persuaded to sign a peace treaty in 1538, he again allied himself with the Ottomans in 1542 in a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]]. In 1543 Charles allied himself with Henry VIII and forced Francis to sign the [[Peace of Cr\u00e9py|Truce of Cr\u00e9py-en-Laonnois]]. Later, in 1547, Charles signed a humiliating<ref name=\"treaty\">In particular, in this [[Truce of Adrianople (1547)]] Charles was only referred to as \"King of Spain\" instead of by his extensive titulature.

The text on the left was on the reverse side.]]\n\nThe issue of the [[Protestant Reformation]] was first brought to the imperial attention under Charles V. As [[Holy Roman Emperor]], Charles called [[Martin Luther]] to the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, promising him safe conduct if he would appear. After Luther defended the [[The Ninety-Five Theses]] and his writings, the Emperor commented: \"that monk will never make me a heretic\". Charles V relied on religious unity to govern his various realms, [[Personal union|otherwise unified only in his person]], and perceived Luther's teachings as a disruptive form of [[heresy]]. He outlawed Luther and issued the [[Edict of Worms]], declaring: \n\n{{quote|You know that I am a descendant of the Most Christian Emperors of the great German people, of the Catholic Kings of Spain, of the Archdukes of Austria, and of the Dukes of Burgundy. All of these, their whole life long, were faithful sons of the Roman Church\u2026After their deaths they left, by natural law and heritage, these holy catholic rites, for us to live and die by, following their example. And so until now I have lived as a true follower of these our ancestors. I am therefore resolved to maintain everything which these my forebears have established to the present.\"|}}\n\nNonetheless, Charles V kept his word and let Martin Luther free to leave the city. Frederick the Wise, [[elector of Saxony]] and protector of Luther, lamented the outcome of the Diet. On the road back from Worms, Luther was kidnapped by Frederick's men and hidden in a far away castle in [[Wartburg]]. There, he began to work on his German translation of the bible. The spread of Lutheranism led to two major revolts: that of the knights in 1522-1523 and that of the paesants led by [[Thomas Muntzer]] in 1524\u20131525. While the pro-Imperial [[Swabian League]], in conjunction with Protestant princes afraid of social revolts, restored order, Charles V used the instrument of pardon to maintain peace.\n\nThereafter, Charles V took a tolerant approach and pursued a policy of reconciliation with the Lutherans. At the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530, Luther's assistant [[Philip Melanchthon]] went even further and presented to Charles V the Lutheran [[Augsburg confession]]. The emperor strongly rejected it, and in 1531 the [[Schmalkaldic League]] was formed by Protestant princes. In 1532, Charles V recognized the League and effectively suspended the Edict of Worms with the ''standstill of [[Nuremberg]]''. The ''standstill'' required the Protestants to continue to take part in the Imperial wars against the Turks and the French, and postponed religious affairs until an [[ecumenical council]] of the [[Catholic Church]] was called by the Pope to solve the issue.\n\nDue to Papal delays in organizing a general council, Charles V decided to organize a German summit and presided over the ''[[Regensburg]] talks'' between Catholics and Lutherans in 1541, but no compromise was achieved. In 1545, the [[Council of Trent]] was finally opened and the [[Counter-Reformation]] began. The Catholic initiative was supported by a number of the princes of the Holy Roman Empire. However, the Schmalkaldic League refused to recognize the validity of the council and occupied territories of catholic princes. Thus Charles V outlawed the Schmalkaldic League and opened hostilities against it in 1546 (the year of Luther's death). The next year his forces drove the League's troops out of southern Germany, and defeated [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony]] and [[Philip I of Hesse|Philip of Hesse]] at the [[Battle of M\u00fchlberg]], capturing both. At the [[Augsburg Interim]] in 1548, he created a solution giving certain allowances to Protestants until the Council of Trent would restore unity. However, members of both sides resented the Interim and some actively opposed it. \n\nThe Council was re-opened in 1550 with the participation of Lutherans, and Charles V set up the Imperial court in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, sufficiently close to Trent for him to follow the evolution of the debates. In 1552 Protestant princes, in alliance with [[Henry II of France]], [[Second Schmalkaldic War|rebelled again]] and the second Schmalkaldic War began. [[Maurice of Saxony]], instrumental for the Imperial victory in the first conflict, switched side to the Protestant cause and bypassed the Imperial army by marching directly into Innsbruck with the goal of capturing the Emperor. Charles V was forced to flee the city during an attack of [[gout]] and barely made it alive to [[Villach]] in a state of semi-consciousness carried in a [[litter (vehicle)|litter]]. After failing to recapture [[Metz]] from the French, Charles V returned to the Low Countries for the last years of his emperorship. In 1555, he instructed his brother Ferdinand to sign the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in his name. The agreements led to the religious division of Germany between Catholic and Protestant princedoms.\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:La emperatriz Isabel de Portugal, por Tiziano.jpg|thumb|left|Isabella of Portugal, Charles's wife. Portrait by [[Titian]], 1548]]\nDuring his lifetime, Charles V had several mistresses, his step-grandmother, [[Germaine de Foix]] among them. These liaisons occurred during his bachelorhood and only once during his widowhood; there are no records of his having any extramarital affairs during his marriage.\n\nOn 21 December 1507, Charles was betrothed to 11-year old [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]], the daughter of King [[Henry VII of England]] and younger sister to the future King [[Henry VIII of England]], who was to take the throne in two years. However, the engagement was called off in 1513, on the advice of [[Thomas Wolsey]], and Mary was instead married to King [[Louis XII of France]] in 1514.\n\nAfter his ascension to the Spanish thrones, negotiations for Charles's marriage began shortly after his arrival in Castile, with the Castilian nobles expressing their wishes for him to marry his first cousin [[Isabella of Portugal]], the daughter of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and Charles's aunt [[Maria of Aragon, Queen of Portugal|Maria of Aragon]]. The nobles desired Charles's marriage to a princess of Castilian blood, and a marriage to Isabella would have secured an alliance between Castile and Portugal. However, the 18-year-old King was in no hurry to marry and ignored the nobles' advice. Instead of marrying Isabella, he sent his sister [[Eleanor of Austria|Eleanor]] to marry Isabella's widowed father, King Manuel, in 1518. In 1521, on the advice of his Flemish counselors, especially [[William de Cro\u00ff]], Charles became engaged to his other first cousin, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], daughter of his aunt, [[Catherine of Aragon]], and King Henry VIII, in order to secure an alliance with England. However, this engagement was very problematic because Mary was only 6 years old at the time, sixteen years Charles's junior, which meant that he would have to wait for her to be old enough to marry.\n\nBy 1525, Charles was no longer interested in an alliance with England and could not wait any longer to have legitimate children and heirs. Following his victory in the [[Battle of Pavia]], Charles abandoned the idea of an English alliance, cancelled his engagement to Mary and decided to marry Isabella and form an alliance with Portugal. He wrote to Isabella's brother, King [[John III of Portugal]], making a double marriage contract \u2013 Charles would marry Isabella and John would marry Charles's youngest sister, [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal|Catherine]]. A marriage to Isabella was more beneficial for Charles, as she was closer to him in age, was fluent in Spanish and provided him with a very handsome dowry of 900,000 Portuguese cruzados or Castilian folds that would help to solve the financial problems brought on by the Italian Wars.\n\n[[File:Charles V and Empress Isabella of Portugal, by Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Charles V and Empress Isabella. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] after [[Titian]], 17th century]]\n\nOn 10 March 1526, Charles and Isabella met at the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville|Alc\u00e1zar Palace]] in [[Seville]]. The marriage was originally a political arrangement, but on their first meeting, the couple fell deeply in love: Isabella captivated the Emperor with her beauty and charm. They were married that very same night in a quiet ceremony in the Hall of Ambassadors, just after midnight. Following their wedding, Charles and Isabella spent a long and happy honeymoon at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]]. Charles began the construction of the [[Palace of Charles V]] in 1527, wishing to establish a permanent residence befitting an emperor and empress in the Alhambra palaces. However, the palace was not completed during their lifetimes and remained roofless until the late 20th century.<ref>[http://www.alhambra.org/eng/index.asp?secc=/alhambra/history_alhambra/palacio_carlos_v Palace of Charles V] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924081126/http://www.alhambra.org/eng/index.asp?secc=%2Falhambra%2Fhistory_alhambra%2Fpalacio_carlos_v |date=24 September 2016 }}, Alhambra.org</ref>\n\nDespite the Emperor's long absences due to political affairs abroad, the marriage was a happy one, as both partners were always devoted and faithful to each other.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kamen |date=1997-05-29 |first=H. |title=Philip of Spain |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-07081-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/philipofspain00kame/page/2 2] |authorlink=Henry Kamen |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/philipofspain00kame/page/2 }}</ref> The Empress acted as regent of Spain during her husband's absences, and she proved herself to be a good politician and ruler, thoroughly impressing the Emperor with many of her political accomplishments and decisions.\n\nThe marriage lasted for thirteen years, until Isabella's death in 1539. The Empress contracted a fever during the third month of her seventh pregnancy, which resulted in antenatal complications that caused her to miscarry a stillborn son. Her health further deteriorated due to an infection, and she died two weeks later on 1 May 1539, aged 35. Charles was left so grief-stricken by his wife's death that for two months he shut himself up in a monastery, where he prayed and mourned for her in solitude.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|pp=6\u20137}} Charles never recovered from Isabella's death, dressing in black for the rest of his life to show his eternal mourning, and, unlike most kings of the time, he never remarried.

Although Papal coronation was not necessary to confirm the Imperial title, Charles V [[Coronation of Charles V|was crowned]] in the city of Bologna by [[Pope Clement VII]] in the medieval fashion. \n\nCharles V accumulated a large number of titles due to his vast inheritance of Burgundian, Spanish, and Austrian realms. Following the pacts of Worms (21 April 1521) and Brussels (7 February 1522), he secretely gave the Austrian lands to his younger brother [[Emperor Ferdinand I|Ferdinand]] and elevated him to the status of Archduke. Nevertheless, according to the agreements, Charles continued to style himself as Archduke of Austria and maintained that Ferdinand acted as his vassal and vicar.<ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=5OcgAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA210&dq=Ferdinand+younger+brother+vassal+of+Charles&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6iISg79flAhXssaQKHbGvA9YQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Ferdinand%20younger%20brother%20vassal%20of%20Charles&f=false]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=5T6uAAAAMAAJ&q=Ferdinand+lieutenant+1521&dq=Ferdinand+lieutenant+1521&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIyfvozcjlAhWMDuwKHY7eCiAQ6AEITzAF]</ref> Furthermore, the pacts of 1521-1522 imposed restrictions on the governorship and regency of Ferdinand. For example, all of Ferdinand's letters to Charles V were signed \"your obedient brother and servant\".<ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=vZVHAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA487&dq=Ferdinand+Charles+v+muy+poderoso&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjWxdSv5IzmAhVByqQKHXQ5BJEQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Ferdinand%20Charles%20v%20muy%20poderoso&f=false]</ref> Nonetheless, the same agreements promised Ferdinand the designation as future emperor and the transfer of hereditary rights over Austria at the imperial succession.\n\nFollowing the death of [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II, King of Hungary and Bohemia]] at the [[Battle of Mohacs]] in 1526, Charles V favored the election of Ferdinand as king of Hungary (and Croatia and Dalmatia) and Bohemia. Despite this, Charles also styled himself as king of Hungary and Bohemia and retained this titular use in official acts (such as his testament) as in the case of the Austrian lands. As a consequence, cartographers and historians have described those kingdoms both as realms of Charles V and as possessions of Ferdinand, not without confusion. Others, such as the Venetian enoys, reported that the states of Ferdinand were \"all held in common with the Emperor\".<ref>''Relazione di Germania 1526'' in ''Relazioni degli ambasciatori Veneti al Senato: Germania''</ref > \n\nTherefore, although he had agreed on the future division of the dynasty between Ferdinand and [[Philip II of Spain]], during his own reign Charles V conceived the existence of a single \"House of Austria\" of which he was the sole head.<ref> https://books.google.it/books?id=XsQeBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA53&dq=Martyn+Rady+one+house+of+Austria&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL_qrej5foAhXB4KQKHUXQCB8Q6AEIPzAD#v=onepage&q=House%20of%20Austria&f=false</ref> In the abdications of 1554\u20131556, Charles left his personal possessions to Philip II and the Imperial title to Ferdinand. The titles of King of Hungary, of Dalmatia, Croatia, etc., were also nominally left to the Spanish line (in particular to [[Don Carlos, Prince of Asturias]] and son of Philip II). However, Charles's Imperial abdication marked the beginning of Ferdinand's [[suo jure]] rule in Austria and his other lands: despite the claims of Philip and his descendants, Hungary and Bohemia were left under the nominal and substantial rule of Ferdinand and his successors. Formal disputes between the two lines over Hungary and Bohemia will be solved with the [[Onate treaty]] of 1617.\n\nCharles's full titulature went as follows:\n\n''Charles, [[by the grace of God]], Emperor of the Romans, forever [[Augustus (honorific)|August]], King of Germany, King of Italy, King of all Spains, of Castile, Aragon, Le\u00f3n, of Hungary, of Dalmatia, of Croatia, Navarra, Grenada, Toledo, Valencia, Galicia, Majorca, Sevilla, Cordova, Murcia, Ja\u00e9n, Algarves, Algeciras, Gibraltar, the Canary Islands, King of Two Sicilies, of Sardinia, Corsica, King of Jerusalem, King of the Indies, of the Islands and Mainland of the Ocean Sea, Archduke of Austria, Duke of Burgundy, Brabant, Lorraine, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, Limburg, Luxembourg, Gelderland, Neopatria, W\u00fcrttemberg, Landgrave of Alsace, Prince of Swabia, Asturia and Catalonia, Count of Flanders, Habsburg, Tyrol, Gorizia, Barcelona, Artois, Burgundy Palatine, Hainaut, Holland, Seeland, Ferrette, Kyburg, Namur, Roussillon, Cerdagne, Drenthe, Zutphen, Margrave of the Holy Roman Empire, Burgau, [[Oristano]] and [[Gociano]], Lord of Frisia, [[Windic March|the Wendish March]], Pordenone, Biscay, Molin, Salins, Tripoli and Mechelen.''{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[File:Carlos V en M\u00fchlberg, by Titian, from Prado in Google_Earth.jpg|thumb|right|Charles&nbsp;V on horseback in M\u00fchlberg.

Conversely, in [[Charles De Coster]]'s masterpiece ''[[The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak|Thyl Ulenspiegel]]'' (1867), after his death Charles V is consigned to Hell as punishment for the acts of the [[Inquisition]] under his rule, his punishment being that he would feel the pain of anyone tortured by the Inquisition. De Coster's book also mentions the story on the spectacles in the coat of arms of [[Oudenaarde]], the one about a paysant of [[Berchem]] in ''Het geuzenboek'' (1979) by [[Louis Paul Boon]], while {{Interlanguage link multi|Abraham Hans|nl}} (1882\u20131939) included both tales in ''De liefdesavonturen van keizer Karel in Vlaanderen''.\n* [[Lord Byron]]'s ''Ode to [[Napoleon Buonaparte]]'' refers to Charles as \"The Spaniard\".\n[[File:Escutcheon of Charles V of Spain MET DT287185.jpg|thumb|right|''Escutcheon of Charles V'', watercolour, [[John Singer Sargent]], 1912.

In Act 4 Scene 1 of the A Text, Faustus attends Court by the Emperor's request and with the assistance of [[Mephistopheles]] conjures up spirits representing [[Alexander the Great]] and his paramour as a demonstration of his magical powers.\n\n===Opera===\n* [[Ernst Krenek]]'s opera ''[[Karl V]]'' (opus 73, 1930) examines the title character's career via flashbacks.\n* In the third act of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Ernani]]'', the election of Charles as Holy Roman Emperor is presented. Charles (Don Carlo in the opera) prays before the tomb of [[Charlemagne]].

Meanwhile, Charles V had come to an agreement with [[Pope Paul III]] for the organisation of the [[Council of Trent]] (1545).

Dynastic accidents eventually brought in the person of ''Charles of Ghent'', as he was known at his birth, the four inheritances of Burgundy, Castile, Aragon, and Austria. \n\nThe Burgundian inheritance included the [[Habsburg Netherlands]], which consisted of a large number of the lordships that formed the [[Low Countries]] and covered modern-day [[Belgium]], [[Holland]] and [[Luxembourg]]. It excluded [[Burgundy|Burgundy proper]], annexed by France in 1477, with the exception of [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]]. Charles was born in the Low Countries and his name was chosen in honor of his ancestor [[Charles the Bold|Charles ''the Bold'' of Burgundy]]. At the death of Philip in 1506, Charles was recognized [[Lord of the Netherlands]] with the title of ''Charles II of Burgundy''. During Charles's childhood and teen years, [[William de Cro\u00ff]] (later prime minister) and Adrian of Utrecht (later [[Pope Adrian VI]]) served as his tutors. The culture and courtly life of the Low Countries played an important part in the development of Charles's beliefs. As a member of the Burgundian [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] in his infancy, and later its grandmaster, Charles was educated to the ideals of the medieval knights and the desire for Christian unity to fight the infidel.<ref>{{cite book| last=Heath| first=Richard| title=Charles V: Duty and Dynasty \u2013 The Emperor and his Changing World 1500\u20131558| year=2018|page=23| isbn=978-1-725-85278-5}}</ref> The Low Countries were very rich during his reign, both [[History of capitalism|economically]] and [[Flemish art|culturally]]. Charles was very attached to his homeland and spent much of his life in [[Brussels]].\n\n[[File:Jakob Seisenegger 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[Jakob Seisenegger]], 1533]]\n\nThe Spanish inheritance, resulting from a [[dynastic union]] of the crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]], included [[Spain]] as well as the Castilian [[West Indies]] and the Aragonese [[Two Sicilies]]. Joanna inherited these territories in 1516 in a condition of mental illness. Charles, therefore, claimed the crowns for himself ''[[jure matris]]'', thus becoming co-monarch of Joanna with the title of ''Charles I of Castile and Aragon'' or ''Charles I of Spain''.  Castile and Aragon together formed the largest of Charles's personal possessions, and they also provided a great number of generals and [[tercios]] (the formidable Spanish infantry of the time). However, at his accession to the throne, Charles was viewed as a foreign prince. Two rebellions, the [[revolt of the Germanies]] and the [[revolt of the comuneros]], contested Charles's rule in the 1520s. Following these revolts, Charles placed Spanish counselors in a position of power and spent a considerable part of his life in Castile, including his final years in a monastery. Indeed, Charles's motto, ''[[Plus Ultra (motto)|Plus Ultra]]'' (''Further Beyond''), became the national motto of Spain and his heir, later Philip II, was born and raised in Castile. Nonetheless, many Spaniards believed that their resources (largely consisting of flows of silver from the Americas) were being used to sustain Imperial-Habsburg policies that were not in the country's interest.<ref>History of Spain, Joseph Perez</ref>\n\nCharles inherited the [[Austrian hereditary lands]] in 1519, as ''Charles I of Austria'', and obtained the election as Holy Roman Emperor against the candidacy of the French King. Since the Imperial election, he was known as ''Emperor Charles V'' even outside of Germany and the ''[[A.E.I.O.U.]]'' motto of the House of Austria acquired political significance. Despite the fact that he was elected as a German prince, Charles's staunch Catholicism in contrast to the growth of Lutheranism alienated him from various German princes who finally fought against him. Charles's presence in Germany was often marked by the organization of [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|imperial diet]]s to maintain religious unity. He was frequently in Northern Italy, often taking part in complicated negotiations with the [[Pope]]s to address the rise of Protestantism. It is important to note, though, that the German Catholics supported the Emperor. Charles had a close relationship with important German families, like the [[House of Nassau]], many of which were represented at his court in Brussels. Several German princes or noblemen accompanied him in his military campaigns against France or the Ottomans, and the bulk of his army was generally composed of German troops, especially the Imperial [[Landsknechte]].<ref>''Charles V'', Pierre Chaunu</ref><ref>''Germany in the Holy Roman Empire'', Whaley</ref>\n\nIt is said that Charles spoke several languages.

For the regency and governorship of the Austrian hereditary lands, Charles named his brother [[Ferdinand]] Archduke in the Austrian lands under his authority at the [[Diet of Worms]] (1521). Charles also agreed to favor the election of Ferdinand as [[King of the Romans]] in Germany, which took place [[Imperial election, 1531|in 1531]].

The latter territories lied within the Holy Roman Empire and its borders, but were formally divided between fiefs of the [[German kingdom]] and French fiefs such as Charles's birthplace of Flanders, a last remnant of what had been a powerful player in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. As he was a minor, his aunt [[Margaret of Austria (1480-1530)|Margaret of Austria]] (born as Archduchess of Austria and in both her marriages as the Dowager Princess of Asturias and Dowager Duchess of Savoy) acted as regent, as appointed by Emperor Maximilian until 1515. She soon found herself at war with France over the question of Charles's requirement to pay homage to the French king for Flanders, as his father had done. The outcome was that France relinquished its ancient claim on Flanders in 1528.\n\nFrom 1515 to 1523, Charles's government in the Netherlands also had to contend with the rebellion of [[Arumer Zwarte Hoop|Frisian peasants]] (led by [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] and [[Wijard Jelckama]]). The rebels were initially successful but after a series of defeats, the remaining leaders were captured and decapitated in 1523.\n\nCharles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of [[Tournaisis|Tournai]], [[County of Artois|Artois]], [[Bishopric of Utrecht|Utrecht]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], and [[Guelders]]. The [[Seventeen Provinces]] had been unified by Charles's Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were [[fief]]s of either France or the Holy Roman Empire. In 1549, Charles issued a [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549|Pragmatic Sanction]], declaring the Low Countries to be a unified entity of which his family would be the heirs.<ref name=\"Kamen\">{{cite book| last = Kamen| first = Henry| year = 2005| title = Spain, 1469\u20131714: a society of conflict| edition = 3rd| publisher = Pearson Education| url = https://archive.org/details/spain14691714soc00kame| location = Harlow, United Kingdom| isbn = 0-582-78464-6| url-status = dead| df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Low Countries held an important place in the Empire.

On Charles's accession to the Spanish thrones, the Parliament of Navarre (''Cortes'') required him to attend the coronation ceremony (to become Charles IV of Navarre), but this demand fell on deaf ears, and the Parliament kept piling up grievances.\n\nCharles was accepted as sovereign, even though the Spanish felt uneasy with the Imperial style. Spanish kingdoms varied in their traditions. Castile had become an authoritarian, highly centralized kingdom, where the monarch's own will easily overrode legislative and justice institutions.<ref>{{cite book | author1 = Monreal, Gregorio| author2 = Jimeno, Roldan|year = 2012 | title = Conquista e Incorporaci\u00f3n de Navarra a Castilla| publisher = Pamiela | location=Pamplona-Iru\u00f1a| isbn = 978-84-7681-736-0|pages = 37-43}}</ref> By contrast, in the crown of Aragon, and especially in the Pyrenean kingdom of Navarre, law prevailed, and the monarchy was seen as [[Basque fuero|a contract with the people]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQioAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA104&dq=navarre,+law+prevailed,+and+the+monarchy+was+a+contract+with+the+people&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjsyKOXj8zlAhWExVkKHR6HDBQQ6AEwAnoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=navarre,%20law%20prevailed,%20and%20the%20monarchy%20was%20a%20contract%20with%20the%20people&f=false|title=The Albany Law Journal: A Monthly Record of the Law and the Lawyers|date=1899|publisher=Weed, Parsons|language=en}}</ref> This became an inconvenience and a matter of dispute for Charles V and later kings, since realm-specific traditions limited their absolute power. With Charles, government became more absolute, even though until his mother's death in 1555 Charles did not hold the full kingship of the country.\n\nSoon resistance to the Emperor arose because of heavy taxation to support foreign wars in which Castilians had little interest, and because Charles tended to select Flemings for high offices in Castile and America, ignoring Castilian candidates. The resistance culminated in the [[Revolt of the Comuneros]], which Charles suppressed. Immediately after crushing the Castilian revolt, Charles was confronted again with the hot issue of Navarre when King [[Henry II of Navarre|Henry II]] attempted to [[Spanish conquest of Navarre#1521 French-Navarrese expedition|reconquer the kingdom]]. Main military operations lasted until 1524, when [[Hondarribia]] surrendered to Charles's forces, but frequent cross-border clashes in the western Pyrenees only stopped in 1528 (Treaties of Madrid and Cambrai).\n\nAfter these events, Navarre remained a matter of domestic and international litigation still for a century (a French dynastic claim to the throne did not end until the [[July Revolution]] in 1830). Charles wanted his son and heir [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] to marry the heiress of Navarre, [[Jeanne d'Albret]]. Jeanne was instead forced to marry [[William, Duke of Julich-Cleves-Berg]], but that childless marriage was annulled after four years. She next married [[Antoine de Bourbon]], and both she and their son would oppose [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] in the French Wars of Religion.\n\nCastile became integrated into Charles's empire, and provided the bulk of the empire's financial resources as well as very effective military units. The enormous budget deficit accumulated during Charles's reign, along with the [[Spanish price revolution|inflation that affected the kingdom]], resulted in declaring bankruptcy during the reign of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]].<ref>Elliot, J.H.

As Holy Roman Emperor, Charles was sovereign in several states of northern Italy and had a claim to the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] (obtained in 1530). The [[Duchy of Milan]], however, was under French control. [[Early Modern France|France]] took Milan from the [[House of Sforza]] after victory against Switzerland at the [[Battle of Marignano]] in 1515. Imperial-Papal troops succeeded in re-installing the Sforza in Milan in 1521, in the context of an alliance between Charles V and Pope Leo X. A Franco-Swiss army was finally expelled from Lombardy at [[Battle of Bicocca|Bicocca]] a year later. Yet in 1524 Francis I of France retook the initiative, crossing into Lombardy where Milan, along with a number of other cities, once again fell to his attack. [[Pavia]] alone held out, and on 24 February 1525 (Charles's twenty-fifth birthday), Charles's forces led by [[Charles de Lannoy]] captured Francis and crushed his army in the [[Battle of Pavia]]. In 1535, [[Francesco II Sforza]] died without heirs and Charles V annexed the territory as a vacant Imperial state. Charles successfully held on to all of its Italian territories, though they were invaded again on multiple occasions during the [[Italian Wars]].\n\nIn addition, Habsburg trade in the Mediterranean was consistently disrupted by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1538 a [[Holy League (1538)|Holy League]] consisting of all the Italian states and the Spanish kingdoms was formed to drive the Ottomans back, but it was defeated at the [[Battle of Preveza (1538)|Battle of Preveza]]. Decisive naval victory eluded Charles; it would not be achieved until after Charles's death, at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571.\n\n===America===\nDuring Charles's reign, the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Castilian territories in the Americas]] were considerably extended by ''[[conquistador]]es'' like [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]]. They conquered the large [[Aztec]] and [[Inca]] empires and incorporated them into the Empire as the Viceroyalties of [[New Spain]] and [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] between 1519 and 1542. Combined with the circumnavigation of the globe by the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan expedition]] in 1522, these successes convinced Charles of his divine mission to become the leader of [[Christendom]], which still perceived a significant threat from Islam. The conquests also helped solidify Charles's rule by providing the state treasury with enormous amounts of [[bullion]]. As the conquistador [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]] observed, \"We came to serve God and his Majesty, to give light to those in darkness, and also to acquire that wealth which most men covet.\"<ref name=\"Prescott\">{{cite book| last =  Prescott| first =  William Hickling| year = 1873| title = History of the Conquest of Mexico, with a Preliminary View of Ancient Mexican Civilization, and the Life of the Conqueror, Hernando Cortes| edition = 3rd| publisher = Electronic Text Center, University of Virginia Library| url = http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/PreConq.html| isbn = 1-152-29570-5}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 August 1518 Charles issued a charter authorising the transportation of slaves direct from Africa to the Americas. Up until that point (since at least 1510), African slaves had usually been transported to Castile or Portugal and had then been transhipped to the Caribbean.

After having paid huge bribes to the electors, he defeated the candidacies of [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], [[Francis I of France|Francis I, King of France]], and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII, King of England]]. The electors gave Charles the crown on 28 June 1519. On 26 October 1520 he was crowned in Germany and some ten years later, on [[Coronation of Charles V|22 February 1530]], he was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by [[Pope Clement VII]] in [[Bologna]], the last emperor to receive a papal coronation.<ref>William Maltby, ''The Reign of Charles V'' (St. Martin's Press, 2002)</ref><ref>Claims that he gained the imperial crown through bribery have been questioned.

They gained a strong foothold in the Empire's territories, and Charles was determined not to let this happen in the Netherlands. An [[inquisition]] was established as early as 1522. In 1550, the death penalty was introduced for all cases of unrepentant heresy. Political dissent was also firmly controlled, most notably in his place of birth, where Charles, assisted by the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]], personally suppressed the [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)|Revolt of Ghent]] in mid-February 1540.<ref name=\"Kamen\"/>\n\nCharles abdicated as emperor in 1556 in favour of his brother Ferdinand; however, due to lengthy debate and bureaucratic procedure, the Imperial Diet did not accept the abdication (and thus make it legally valid) until 24 February 1558. Up to that date, Charles continued to use the title of Emperor.\n\n====Wars with France====\n[[File:Truce of Nice 1538.jpg|thumb|Francis I and Charles V made peace at the [[Truce of Nice]] in 1538. Francis actually refused to meet Charles in person, and the treaty was signed in separate rooms.]]\n\nMuch of Charles's reign was taken up by conflicts with France, which found itself encircled by Charles's empire while it still maintained ambitions in Italy.  In 1520, Charles visited [[England]], where his aunt, [[Catherine of Aragon]], urged her husband, Henry VIII, to ally himself with the emperor. In 1508 Charles was nominated by Henry VII to the [[Order of the Garter]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Royal Collection \u2013 The Knights of the Garter under Henry VIII|url = http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/microsites/knightsofthegarter/MicroObject.asp?row=21&themeid=455&item=22|archive-url = https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20111206134156/http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/microsites/knightsofthegarter/MicroObject.asp?row=21&themeid=455&item=22|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2011-12-06|website = www.royalcollection.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}</ref> His [[Garter stall plate]] survives in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|Saint George's Chapel]].\n\nThe [[Italian War of 1521|first war]] with Charles's great nemesis [[Francis I of France]] began in 1521. Charles allied with England and [[Pope Leo X]] against the French and the Venetians, and was highly successful, driving the French out of [[Milan]] and defeating and capturing Francis at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525. To gain his freedom, Francis ceded [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to Charles in the [[Treaty of Madrid (1526)|Treaty of Madrid]], as well as renouncing his support of Henry II's claim over [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]].\n\n[[File:Emperor Charles V seated (Titian).jpg|thumb|left|Portrait, 1548, by [[Lambert Sustris]] (formerly attributed to [[Titian]])]]\n\nWhen he was released, however, Francis had the Parliament of Paris denounce the treaty because it had been signed under [[duress]]. France then joined the [[War of the League of Cognac|League of Cognac]] that [[Pope Clement VII]] had formed with Henry VIII of England, the Venetians, the Florentines, and the Milanese to resist imperial domination of Italy. In the ensuing war, Charles's [[sack of Rome (1527)]] and virtual imprisonment of Pope Clement VII in 1527 prevented the Pope from [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulling]] the marriage of Henry VIII of England and Charles's aunt [[Catherine of Aragon]], so Henry eventually broke with Rome, thus leading to the [[English Reformation]].<ref name=Holmes1993a>Holmes (1993), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BsV-qSRKAnAC&pg=PA192 p. 192]</ref><ref name=Froude1891a>Froude (1891), [https://books.google.com/books?id=n-Ecc8SnlC0C&pg=PA480 p. 35, pp. 90\u201391, pp. 96\u201397] Note: the link goes to page 480, then click the View All option</ref> In other respects, the war was inconclusive. In the [[Treaty of Cambrai]] (1529), called the \"Ladies' Peace\" because it was negotiated between Charles's aunt and Francis' mother, Francis renounced his claims in Italy but retained control of Burgundy.\n\nA [[Italian War of 1536\u201338|third war]] erupted in 1536. Following the death of [[Francesco II Sforza|the last Sforza Duke of Milan]], Charles installed his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]] in the duchy, despite Francis' claims on it. This war too was inconclusive. Francis failed to conquer Milan, but he succeeded in conquering most of the lands of Charles's ally, the [[Charles III, Duke of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]], including his capital [[Turin]]. A truce at [[Nice]] in 1538 on the basis of ''[[uti possidetis]]'' ended the war but lasted only a short time. [[Italian War of 1542\u201346|War resumed in 1542]], with Francis now allied with Ottoman Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] and Charles once again allied with Henry VIII. Despite the conquest of Nice by a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|Franco-Ottoman fleet]], the French could not advance toward Milan, while a joint Anglo-Imperial invasion of northern France, led by Charles himself, won some successes but was ultimately abandoned, leading to another peace and restoration of the ''status quo ante bellum'' in 1544.\n\nA [[Italian War of 1551\u20131559|final war]] erupted with Francis' son and successor, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], in 1551. Henry won early success in [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], where he captured [[Metz]], but French offensives in Italy failed. Charles abdicated midway through this conflict, leaving further conduct of the war to his son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], and his brother, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\n====Conflicts with the Ottoman Empire====\n{{Further|Protestantism and Islam|Habsburg-Persian alliance|Conquest of Tunis (1534)|conquest of Tunis (1535)}}\n\nCharles fought continually with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its sultan, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].

However, by 1541, central and southern Hungary fell under Turkish control.\n\nSuleiman won the contest for mastery of the Mediterranean, in spite of Christian victories such as the [[Conquest of Tunis (1535)|conquest of Tunis]] in 1535. The regular Ottoman fleet came to dominate the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] after its victories at [[Battle of Preveza|Preveza]] in 1538 and [[Battle of Djerba|Djerba]] in 1560 (shortly after Charles's death), which severely decimated the Spanish marine arm. At the same time, the Muslim [[Barbary corsairs]], acting under the general authority and supervision of the sultan, regularly devastated the Spanish and Italian coasts, crippling Spanish trade and chipping at the foundations of Habsburg power.\n\nIn 1536 [[Francis I of France]] allied himself with Suleiman against Charles. While Francis was persuaded to sign a peace treaty in 1538, he again allied himself with the Ottomans in 1542 in a [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]]. In 1543 Charles allied himself with Henry VIII and forced Francis to sign the [[Peace of Cr\u00e9py|Truce of Cr\u00e9py-en-Laonnois]].

The text on the left was on the reverse side.]]\n\nThe issue of the [[Protestant Reformation]] was first brought to the imperial attention under Charles V. As [[Holy Roman Emperor]], Charles called [[Martin Luther]] to the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, promising him safe conduct if he would appear. After Luther defended the [[The Ninety-Five Theses]] and his writings, the Emperor commented: \"that monk will never make me a heretic\". Charles V relied on religious unity to govern his various realms, [[Personal union|otherwise unified only in his person]], and perceived Luther's teachings as a disruptive form of [[heresy]]. He outlawed Luther and issued the [[Edict of Worms]], declaring: \n\n{{quote|You know that I am a descendant of the Most Christian Emperors of the great German people, of the Catholic Kings of Spain, of the Archdukes of Austria, and of the Dukes of Burgundy. All of these, their whole life long, were faithful sons of the Roman Church\u2026After their deaths they left, by natural law and heritage, these holy catholic rites, for us to live and die by, following their example. And so until now I have lived as a true follower of these our ancestors. I am therefore resolved to maintain everything which these my forebears have established to the present.\"|}}\n\nNonetheless, Charles V kept his word and let Martin Luther free to leave the city. Frederick the Wise, [[elector of Saxony]] and protector of Luther, lamented the outcome of the Diet. On the road back from Worms, Luther was kidnapped by Frederick's men and hidden in a far away castle in [[Wartburg]]. There, he began to work on his German translation of the bible. The spread of Lutheranism led to two major revolts: that of the knights in 1522-1523 and that of the paesants led by [[Thomas Muntzer]] in 1524\u20131525. While the pro-Imperial [[Swabian League]], in conjunction with Protestant princes afraid of social revolts, restored order, Charles V used the instrument of pardon to maintain peace.\n\nThereafter, Charles V took a tolerant approach and pursued a policy of reconciliation with the Lutherans. At the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530, Luther's assistant [[Philip Melanchthon]] went even further and presented to Charles V the Lutheran [[Augsburg confession]]. The emperor strongly rejected it, and in 1531 the [[Schmalkaldic League]] was formed by Protestant princes. In 1532, Charles V recognized the League and effectively suspended the Edict of Worms with the ''standstill of [[Nuremberg]]''. The ''standstill'' required the Protestants to continue to take part in the Imperial wars against the Turks and the French, and postponed religious affairs until an [[ecumenical council]] of the [[Catholic Church]] was called by the Pope to solve the issue.\n\nDue to Papal delays in organizing a general council, Charles V decided to organize a German summit and presided over the ''[[Regensburg]] talks'' between Catholics and Lutherans in 1541, but no compromise was achieved. In 1545, the [[Council of Trent]] was finally opened and the [[Counter-Reformation]] began. The Catholic initiative was supported by a number of the princes of the Holy Roman Empire. However, the Schmalkaldic League refused to recognize the validity of the council and occupied territories of catholic princes. Thus Charles V outlawed the Schmalkaldic League and opened hostilities against it in 1546 (the year of Luther's death). The next year his forces drove the League's troops out of southern Germany, and defeated [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony]] and [[Philip I of Hesse|Philip of Hesse]] at the [[Battle of M\u00fchlberg]], capturing both. At the [[Augsburg Interim]] in 1548, he created a solution giving certain allowances to Protestants until the Council of Trent would restore unity. However, members of both sides resented the Interim and some actively opposed it. \n\nThe Council was re-opened in 1550 with the participation of Lutherans, and Charles V set up the Imperial court in [[Innsbruck]], Austria, sufficiently close to Trent for him to follow the evolution of the debates. In 1552 Protestant princes, in alliance with [[Henry II of France]], [[Second Schmalkaldic War|rebelled again]] and the second Schmalkaldic War began. [[Maurice of Saxony]], instrumental for the Imperial victory in the first conflict, switched side to the Protestant cause and bypassed the Imperial army by marching directly into Innsbruck with the goal of capturing the Emperor. Charles V was forced to flee the city during an attack of [[gout]] and barely made it alive to [[Villach]] in a state of semi-consciousness carried in a [[litter (vehicle)|litter]]. After failing to recapture [[Metz]] from the French, Charles V returned to the Low Countries for the last years of his emperorship. In 1555, he instructed his brother Ferdinand to sign the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in his name. The agreements led to the religious division of Germany between Catholic and Protestant princedoms.\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:La emperatriz Isabel de Portugal, por Tiziano.jpg|thumb|left|Isabella of Portugal, Charles's wife. Portrait by [[Titian]], 1548]]\nDuring his lifetime, Charles V had several mistresses, his step-grandmother, [[Germaine de Foix]] among them. These liaisons occurred during his bachelorhood and only once during his widowhood; there are no records of his having any extramarital affairs during his marriage.\n\nOn 21 December 1507, Charles was betrothed to 11-year old [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary]], the daughter of King [[Henry VII of England]] and younger sister to the future King [[Henry VIII of England]], who was to take the throne in two years. However, the engagement was called off in 1513, on the advice of [[Thomas Wolsey]], and Mary was instead married to King [[Louis XII of France]] in 1514.\n\nAfter his ascension to the Spanish thrones, negotiations for Charles's marriage began shortly after his arrival in Castile, with the Castilian nobles expressing their wishes for him to marry his first cousin [[Isabella of Portugal]], the daughter of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] and Charles's aunt [[Maria of Aragon, Queen of Portugal|Maria of Aragon]]. The nobles desired Charles's marriage to a princess of Castilian blood, and a marriage to Isabella would have secured an alliance between Castile and Portugal. However, the 18-year-old King was in no hurry to marry and ignored the nobles' advice. Instead of marrying Isabella, he sent his sister [[Eleanor of Austria|Eleanor]] to marry Isabella's widowed father, King Manuel, in 1518. In 1521, on the advice of his Flemish counselors, especially [[William de Cro\u00ff]], Charles became engaged to his other first cousin, [[Mary I of England|Mary]], daughter of his aunt, [[Catherine of Aragon]], and King Henry VIII, in order to secure an alliance with England. However, this engagement was very problematic because Mary was only 6 years old at the time, sixteen years Charles's junior, which meant that he would have to wait for her to be old enough to marry.\n\nBy 1525, Charles was no longer interested in an alliance with England and could not wait any longer to have legitimate children and heirs. Following his victory in the [[Battle of Pavia]], Charles abandoned the idea of an English alliance, cancelled his engagement to Mary and decided to marry Isabella and form an alliance with Portugal. He wrote to Isabella's brother, King [[John III of Portugal]], making a double marriage contract \u2013 Charles would marry Isabella and John would marry Charles's youngest sister, [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal|Catherine]]. A marriage to Isabella was more beneficial for Charles, as she was closer to him in age, was fluent in Spanish and provided him with a very handsome dowry of 900,000 Portuguese cruzados or Castilian folds that would help to solve the financial problems brought on by the Italian Wars.\n\n[[File:Charles V and Empress Isabella of Portugal, by Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Charles V and Empress Isabella. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] after [[Titian]], 17th century]]\n\nOn 10 March 1526, Charles and Isabella met at the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville|Alc\u00e1zar Palace]] in [[Seville]]. The marriage was originally a political arrangement, but on their first meeting, the couple fell deeply in love: Isabella captivated the Emperor with her beauty and charm. They were married that very same night in a quiet ceremony in the Hall of Ambassadors, just after midnight. Following their wedding, Charles and Isabella spent a long and happy honeymoon at the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]]. Charles began the construction of the [[Palace of Charles V]] in 1527, wishing to establish a permanent residence befitting an emperor and empress in the Alhambra palaces. However, the palace was not completed during their lifetimes and remained roofless until the late 20th century.<ref>[http://www.alhambra.org/eng/index.asp?secc=/alhambra/history_alhambra/palacio_carlos_v Palace of Charles V] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160924081126/http://www.alhambra.org/eng/index.asp?secc=%2Falhambra%2Fhistory_alhambra%2Fpalacio_carlos_v |date=24 September 2016 }}, Alhambra.org</ref>\n\nDespite the Emperor's long absences due to political affairs abroad, the marriage was a happy one, as both partners were always devoted and faithful to each other.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kamen |date=1997-05-29 |first=H. |title=Philip of Spain |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-07081-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/philipofspain00kame/page/2 2] |authorlink=Henry Kamen |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/philipofspain00kame/page/2 }}</ref> The Empress acted as regent of Spain during her husband's absences, and she proved herself to be a good politician and ruler, thoroughly impressing the Emperor with many of her political accomplishments and decisions.\n\nThe marriage lasted for thirteen years, until Isabella's death in 1539. The Empress contracted a fever during the third month of her seventh pregnancy, which resulted in antenatal complications that caused her to miscarry a stillborn son. Her health further deteriorated due to an infection, and she died two weeks later on 1 May 1539, aged 35. Charles was left so grief-stricken by his wife's death that for two months he shut himself up in a monastery, where he prayed and mourned for her in solitude.{{sfn|Kamen|1997|pp=6\u20137}} Charles never recovered from Isabella's death, dressing in black for the rest of his life to show his eternal mourning, and, unlike most kings of the time, he never remarried.

Upon Charles's abdication of Naples on 25 July, Philip was invested with the kingdom (officially \"Naples and Sicily\") on 2 October by [[Pope Julius III]].

Although Papal coronation was not necessary to confirm the Imperial title, Charles V [[Coronation of Charles V|was crowned]] in the city of Bologna by [[Pope Clement VII]] in the medieval fashion. \n\nCharles V accumulated a large number of titles due to his vast inheritance of Burgundian, Spanish, and Austrian realms. Following the pacts of Worms (21 April 1521) and Brussels (7 February 1522), he secretely gave the Austrian lands to his younger brother [[Emperor Ferdinand I|Ferdinand]] and elevated him to the status of Archduke. Nevertheless, according to the agreements, Charles continued to style himself as Archduke of Austria and maintained that Ferdinand acted as his vassal and vicar.<ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=5OcgAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA210&dq=Ferdinand+younger+brother+vassal+of+Charles&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6iISg79flAhXssaQKHbGvA9YQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Ferdinand%20younger%20brother%20vassal%20of%20Charles&f=false]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=5T6uAAAAMAAJ&q=Ferdinand+lieutenant+1521&dq=Ferdinand+lieutenant+1521&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIyfvozcjlAhWMDuwKHY7eCiAQ6AEITzAF]</ref> Furthermore, the pacts of 1521-1522 imposed restrictions on the governorship and regency of Ferdinand.

Despite this, Charles also styled himself as king of Hungary and Bohemia and retained this titular use in official acts (such as his testament) as in the case of the Austrian lands. As a consequence, cartographers and historians have described those kingdoms both as realms of Charles V and as possessions of Ferdinand, not without confusion. Others, such as the Venetian enoys, reported that the states of Ferdinand were \"all held in common with the Emperor\".<ref>''Relazione di Germania 1526'' in ''Relazioni degli ambasciatori Veneti al Senato: Germania''</ref > \n\nTherefore, although he had agreed on the future division of the dynasty between Ferdinand and [[Philip II of Spain]], during his own reign Charles V conceived the existence of a single \"House of Austria\" of which he was the sole head.<ref> https://books.google.it/books?id=XsQeBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA53&dq=Martyn+Rady+one+house+of+Austria&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL_qrej5foAhXB4KQKHUXQCB8Q6AEIPzAD#v=onepage&q=House%20of%20Austria&f=false</ref> In the abdications of 1554\u20131556, Charles left his personal possessions to Philip II and the Imperial title to Ferdinand. The titles of King of Hungary, of Dalmatia, Croatia, etc., were also nominally left to the Spanish line (in particular to [[Don Carlos, Prince of Asturias]] and son of Philip II). However, Charles's Imperial abdication marked the beginning of Ferdinand's [[suo jure]] rule in Austria and his other lands: despite the claims of Philip and his descendants, Hungary and Bohemia were left under the nominal and substantial rule of Ferdinand and his successors. Formal disputes between the two lines over Hungary and Bohemia will be solved with the [[Onate treaty]] of 1617.\n\nCharles's full titulature went as follows:\n\n''Charles, [[by the grace of God]], Emperor of the Romans, forever [[Augustus (honorific)|August]], King of Germany, King of Italy, King of all Spains, of Castile, Aragon, Le\u00f3n, of Hungary, of Dalmatia, of Croatia, Navarra, Grenada, Toledo, Valencia, Galicia, Majorca, Sevilla, Cordova, Murcia, Ja\u00e9n, Algarves, Algeciras, Gibraltar, the Canary Islands, King of Two Sicilies, of Sardinia, Corsica, King of Jerusalem, King of the Indies, of the Islands and Mainland of the Ocean Sea, Archduke of Austria, Duke of Burgundy, Brabant, Lorraine, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, Limburg, Luxembourg, Gelderland, Neopatria, W\u00fcrttemberg, Landgrave of Alsace, Prince of Swabia, Asturia and Catalonia, Count of Flanders, Habsburg, Tyrol, Gorizia, Barcelona, Artois, Burgundy Palatine, Hainaut, Holland, Seeland, Ferrette, Kyburg, Namur, Roussillon, Cerdagne, Drenthe, Zutphen, Margrave of the Holy Roman Empire, Burgau, [[Oristano]] and [[Gociano]], Lord of Frisia, [[Windic March|the Wendish March]], Pordenone, Biscay, Molin, Salins, Tripoli and Mechelen.''{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[File:Carlos V en M\u00fchlberg, by Titian, from Prado in Google_Earth.jpg|thumb|right|Charles&nbsp;V on horseback in M\u00fchlberg.

Conversely, in [[Charles De Coster]]'s masterpiece ''[[The Legend of Thyl Ulenspiegel and Lamme Goedzak|Thyl Ulenspiegel]]'' (1867), after his death Charles V is consigned to Hell as punishment for the acts of the [[Inquisition]] under his rule, his punishment being that he would feel the pain of anyone tortured by the Inquisition. De Coster's book also mentions the story on the spectacles in the coat of arms of [[Oudenaarde]], the one about a paysant of [[Berchem]] in ''Het geuzenboek'' (1979) by [[Louis Paul Boon]], while {{Interlanguage link multi|Abraham Hans|nl}} (1882\u20131939) included both tales in ''De liefdesavonturen van keizer Karel in Vlaanderen''.\n* [[Lord Byron]]'s ''Ode to [[Napoleon Buonaparte]]'' refers to Charles as \"The Spaniard\".\n[[File:Escutcheon of Charles V of Spain MET DT287185.jpg|thumb|right|''Escutcheon of Charles V'', watercolour, [[John Singer Sargent]], 1912. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n* Charles V is a notable character in [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s ''[[All Men Are Mortal]]''.\n* In ''[[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|The Maltese Falcon]]'', the title object is said to have been an intended gift to Charles V.\n\n===Plays===\n* Charles V appears as a character in the play ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' by the Elizabethan playwright [[Christopher Marlowe]]. In Act 4 Scene 1 of the A Text, Faustus attends Court by the Emperor's request and with the assistance of [[Mephistopheles]] conjures up spirits representing [[Alexander the Great]] and his paramour as a demonstration of his magical powers.\n\n===Opera===\n* [[Ernst Krenek]]'s opera ''[[Karl V]]'' (opus 73, 1930) examines the title character's career via flashbacks.\n* In the third act of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Ernani]]'', the election of Charles as Holy Roman Emperor is presented. Charles (Don Carlo in the opera) prays before the tomb of [[Charlemagne]]. With the announcement that he is elected as Carlo Quinto he declares an amnesty including the eponymous bandit Ernani who had followed him there to murder him as a rival for the love of Elvira. The opera, based on the [[Victor Hugo]] play ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'', portrays Charles as a callous and cynical adventurer whose character is transformed by the election into a responsible and clement ruler.\n* In another Verdi opera, ''[[Don Carlo]]'', the final scene implies that it is Charles V, now living the last years of his life as a hermit, who rescues his grandson, Don Carlo, from his father [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and the Inquisition, by taking Carlo with him to his hermitage at the monastery in Yuste.\n\n===Food===\n* A Flemish legend about Charles being served a beer at the village of [[Olen, Belgium|Olen]], as well as the emperor's lifelong preference of beer above wine, led to the naming of several beer varieties in his honor. The ''Haacht'' Brewery of [[Boortmeerbeek]] produces Charles Quint, while [[Het Anker Brewery]] in [[Mechelen]] produces Gouden Carolus, including a Grand Cru of the Emperor, brewed once a year on Charles V's birthday.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Charles V\n|publisher=Global Beer Network, Santa Barbara, California, U.S.A.\n|url=http://www.pilaarbijter.com/body_pages/Texts/History&Beer/CharlesV.html\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927080724/http://www.pilaarbijter.com/body_pages/Texts/History%26Beer/CharlesV.html\n|url-status=dead\n|archive-date=27 September 2007\n|accessdate=18 July 2007\n|df=dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|title=Charles Quint Golden Blond\n|publisher=Haacht Brewery\n|url=http://www.haacht.com/en/Merken/Beers/Keizer%20Karel%20Goud%20Blond\n|accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|title=Charles Quint Ruby Red\n|publisher=Haacht Brewery\n|url=http://www.haacht.com/en/Merken/Beers/Keizer%20Karel%20Robijn%20Rood\n|accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Beers by Het Anker\n |publisher   = Brewery Het Anker\n |url         = http://www.hetanker.be/pag_en/index_nl.html\n |accessdate  = 18 July 2007\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070702132119/http://www.hetanker.be/pag_en/index_nl.html\n |archivedate = 2 July 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |df          = dmy\n}}</ref> Grupo Cruzcampo brews Legado De Yuste in honor of Charles and attributes the inspiration to his Flemish origin and his last days at the monastery of Yuste.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n* [[Carlos V (candy bar)|Carlos V]] is the name of a popular chocolate bar in Mexico.
