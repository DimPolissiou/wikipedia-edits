Parts of it were completed, but the project was by and large abandoned, and with the advent of faster road transport, consigned to oblivion. Along with the [[Thiruvananthapuram\u2013Shoranur canal]] which now forms the spine of the modern waterway project in Kerala, the AVM canal network would have formed a formidable water route linking the northern parts of Kerala to Kanyakumari paving way for a continuous waterway along west coast from Kasaragod to Kanyakumari.\n\nThe canal was named after Lord Ananthapadmanabha - the tutelary deity - Queen Victoria and [[Marthanda Varma]], the AVM Canal was literally a 'golden' project, its inauguration having been performed with a golden spade. But the spade also was lost.\n\nThe AVM canal was meant to link Kovalam with Nagercoil in phase one. <nowiki>''</nowiki>In phase two, the canal was to be extended to Kanyakumari. In fact, work was started in different places, but the canal was never completed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/2018/apr/23/golden-canal-abandoned-in-keralas-waterway-development-1805043.html|title='Golden canal' abandoned in Kerala's waterway development|website=The New Indian Express|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The reach between Colachel and Poovar was reportedly completed by 1867 and a shorter reach linking Thiruvananthapuram and Thiruvallam was finished a few years later.\n\nThe [[Anantha Victoria Marthandam Canal]] was formed to connect the extreme south of then [[Thiruvithamkoor]] princely state with its northern parts and trade centers such as [[Alappuzha]] and [[Kollam]]. The canal passed through coastal villages numbering more than 20, including, [[Pozhiyoor]], Marthandamthurai, [[Thengapattanam]], [[Colachel]], and [[Mandaikadu]], they all depended upon this for most of their needs, including agriculture and [[navigation]], but today the purpose is no longer served due to expansion of road ways.\n\nFormer Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa was in favour of the revival. A project also was drawn up. But it went in limbo.\n\nThe [[National Waterways Act, 2016]] declared AVM canal as the [[List of National Waterways in India|National Waterways 13 of India]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=199871|title=Promoting Inland Waterways in The Country|website=pib.gov.in|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n== Potential ==\nThe completion of [[Kovalam]] Port and [[Enayam International Seaport]] will make this canal as an inland waterway facilitating connection between both ports.

'''A.V.M. Canal''' was conceived as a 'water link' between Thiruvananthapuram and Kanyakumari in July 1860 during the reign of Uthradam Thirunal Marthanda Varma Maharaja of [[Travancore]] state. Today it is the [[List of National Waterways in India|National Waterway 13 of India]].\n\n== History ==\nThe A.V.M. Canal was conceived as a 'water link' between Thiruvananthapuram and Kanyakumari in July 1860 during the reign of Uthradam Thirunal Marthanda Varma Maharaja of [[Travancore]] state.. Parts of it were completed, but the project was by and large abandoned, and with the advent of faster road transport, consigned to oblivion. Along with the [[Thiruvananthapuram\u2013Shoranur canal]] which now forms the spine of the modern waterway project in Kerala, the AVM canal network would have formed a formidable water route linking the northern parts of Kerala to Kanyakumari paving way for a continuous waterway along west coast from Kasaragod to Kanyakumari.\n\nThe canal was named after Lord Ananthapadmanabha - the tutelary deity - Queen Victoria and [[Marthanda Varma]], the AVM Canal was literally a 'golden' project, its inauguration having been performed with a golden spade. But the spade also was lost.\n\nThe AVM canal was meant to link Kovalam with Nagercoil in phase one. <nowiki>''</nowiki>In phase two, the canal was to be extended to Kanyakumari. In fact, work was started in different places, but the canal was never completed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/2018/apr/23/golden-canal-abandoned-in-keralas-waterway-development-1805043.html|title='Golden canal' abandoned in Kerala's waterway development|website=The New Indian Express|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The reach between Colachel and Poovar was reportedly completed by 1867 and a shorter reach linking Thiruvananthapuram and Thiruvallam was finished a few years later.\n\nThe [[Anantha Victoria Marthandam Canal]] was formed to connect the extreme south of then [[Thiruvithamkoor]] princely state with it's northern parts and trade centers such as [[Alappuzha]] and [[Kollam]]. The canal passed through coastal villages numbering more than 20, including, [[Pozhiyoor]], Marthandamthurai, [[Thengapattanam]], [[Colachel]], and [[Mandaikadu]], they all depended upon this for most of their needs, including agriculture and [[navigation]], but today the purpose is no longer served due to expansion of road ways.\n\nFormer Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa was in favour of the revival. A project also was drawn up. But it went in limbo.\n\nThe [[National Waterways Act, 2016]] declared AVM canal as the [[List of National Waterways in India|National Waterways 13 of India]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=199871|title=Promoting Inland Waterways in The Country|website=pib.gov.in|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n== Potential ==\nThe completion of [[Kovalam]] Port and [[Enayam International Seaport]] will make this canal as an inland waterway facilitating connection between both ports.
