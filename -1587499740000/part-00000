He defined the thought process, and how it reaches the status of conviction or concepts. He discussed the internal working of thoughts, convictions, and concepts in shaping the Nafs or emotions and sentiments. Delving into the internal workings of how people reach conclusions & the psychology behind the process derives itself from Taqiuddin al-Nabhani's roots in non-Ascetic legalistic Sufism from his first teacher and maternal grandfather Ismail al-Nabhani.\n\nAl-Nabhani's definitions of thought have been used in the study of Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and information processing research discussed in the Addison-Wesley published book \"Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine (Systems Programming Series)\" and used in London South Bank University's information systems department.\n\nAfter many philosophical discussions on the nature of thoughts and emotions, Nabhani concludes that the only way to bring about change is via discussion, refutation, and revival of the relevant thoughts and emotions. It is from this philosophical basis that he argued that force does not work to change peoples' ideas. He also argued that a decline in the Muslims' thought, emotions and concepts led to their decline & the eventual destruction of the Khilafah. He believed the first major step towards a decline in the Muslims was confusion about, and dealing with new foreign ideas, mainly Greek, Persian & eastern philosophy.\n\nHe argued the Islamic World did not know how to tackle & contextualise these ideas because they became insular and complacent of preserving & keeping relevant their own Islamic thoughts or philosophy to a world in flux. The heavy emphasis on pinpointing, defining and changing peoples thoughts, convictions, or emotions, via stronger thoughts, diagnosis, and refutation of the process an individual uses to reach their particular 'incorrect' view, is the method of Hizb ut-Tahrir's argumentation on almost every issue.\n\n===Faith vs. rational belief===\nNabhani claimed Islam is founded on the rational belief and not blind faith, being very similar to Ghazali's Kalam Argument. However, both Nabhani and Ghazali argued that after belief (Aqeeda) is established, divine laws in the Quran are beyond question due to the 'mind' of God being beyond human comprehension. Nabhani loosely affirmed rationalism (not that of the [[Mu'tazili]]) but argued that it can establish belief in a God just like Ghazali and Ghazali's teacher al-Juwayni in his book [4], contrary to the common western notion of rationalism. He tried to outline materialist arguments and axioms to prove that one unlimited creator of the universe, God ([[Allah]]) can be proven by rational deduction. He believed that the dependency of, and limited physical nature of every tangible thing within human perception point ultimately to an unlimited creator that is beyond need and dependency, an Absolute Infinite.\n\n==Books==\n*''Saving Palestine'' - 1950<ref>[http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/who-is-ht/prominent-members/sheikh-muhammad-taqiuddin-al-nabhani.html Sheikh Muhammad Taqiuddin al-Nabhani] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819200236/http://www.hizb.org.uk/hizb/who-is-ht/prominent-members/sheikh-muhammad-taqiuddin-al-nabhani.html |date=2010-08-19 }}, [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]].</ref>\n*''The Message of the Arabs'' - 1950\n*''The System for Society'' - 1950\n*''The Ruling System in Islam'' - 1953\n*''[[The Economic System In Islam]]'' - 1953\n*''The Social System in Islam'' -1953\n*''The Party Structure'' -1953\n*''The Concepts of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1953\n*''The Islamic State'' - 1953\n*''The Islamic Personality'' (in three volumes) - 1960\n*''Political Concepts of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1969\n*''Political View of Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1972\n*''Introduction to the Constitution or the Reasons That Make it Obligatory'' - 1963\n*''The Khilafah'' - 1967\n*''Presence of Mind'' - 1976\n*''A Burning Call to the Muslims from Hizb ut-Tahrir'' - 1965\n*''Thinking'' - 1973\n*''The Jurisprudence of Prayer''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{More footnotes|date=November 2010}}\n\n* {{Cite journal\n |magazine    = Al-Waie Magazine\n |issue       = 234-235\n |date        = August\u2013September 2006\n |language    = Arabic\n |title       = \u0628\u0632\u0648\u063a \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0642\u0635\u0649: \u0627\u0646\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0645\u0633\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u062d\u0632\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631\n |url         = http://www.al-waie.org/issues/234-235/article.php?id=396_0_31_0_C\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209002225/http://www.al-waie.org/issues/234-235/article.php?id=396_0_31_0_C\n |archivedate = 2015-02-09\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n |title       = An-Nabhani: Palestinian Intellectual\n |work        = [[Islamic Da'wah Foundation Malaysia]]\n |url         = http://www.yadim.com.my/english/Ulama/UlamaFull.asp?Id=75\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101219055210/http://www.yadim.com.my/english/Ulama/UlamaFull.asp?Id=75\n |archivedate = 2010-12-19\n}}\n* {{Citation |last=Watt|first=Montgomery|title=The Faith and Practice of Al-Ghazali (Translation of al-Munqid min al-Dalal)|year=2004|place=Oxford|publisher=OneWorld Publications}}\n* {{Citation |last=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=The System of Islam Nidham al-Islam|year=2002|publication-place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n* {{Citation|surname=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=Thought al-Tafkeer|year=2004|place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n* {{Citation|surname=Nabhani|given=Taqi al-Din|title=Islamic Personality al-Shaksiyyah al-Islamiyyah|year=2005|place=London|publisher=al-Khilafah Publications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nabhani, Taqiuddin}}\n[[Category:1929 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n[[Category:Arab people in British Palestine]]\n[[Category:Palestinian Islamists]]\n[[Category:Members of Hizb ut-Tahrir]]\n[[Category:Al-Azhar University alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=April 2020}}\n{{Copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n{{Tone|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n'''Kamal al-Din al-Nabhani''' (January 3, 1929 \u2013 December 31, 2006) was one of the founders of the Islamist political party [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and was a son of Sheikh [[Taqi al-Din al-Nabhani]].\n\n== Early Life ==\nKamal al-Din al-Nabhani was born on January 3, 1929, in Beirut, Lebanon.\n\n== Thought ==\n\n=== Philosophy and Theology ===\n\nNabhani in his books 'Thought' and 'System of Islam 2' after his father [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]] placed heavy emphasis on discussing modes and models of the psychology behind human thought, and concepts.

He appears in all mainline games in the series, comics that are published by [[Dynamite Entertainment]], and two live action films. The character first appeared in ''[[Hitman: Codename 47]]'' (2000) and most recently in [[Hitman 2 (2018 video game)|''Hitman 2'']] (2018).\n\n47 is a paid assassin (a [[hitman]]) and a [[Human cloning|clone]]. He gets his name from being the forty-seventh clone created from the [[DNA]] of five different men. These clones were made to be perfect assassins who could easily maintain peak physicality and intelligence, while easily being controlled by whoever they were devoted to, usually a [[Agent handling|handler]]. As 47, the player gets to travel the world and execute hits on individuals, while trying to be as stealthy as possible. This includes taking disguises, using aliases, and using silenced weaponry.\n \nThe character of Agent 47 has been well received by critics and has become a well known video game character since his inception in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/50-most-iconic-video-game-characters-of-the-21st-century-193057/46-tommy-vercetti-104218/|title=50 Most Iconic Video Game Characters of the 21st Century|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2019-02-28|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Concept and creation==\nAccording to Jacob Andersen, lead designer of ''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin'', Agent 47 went from being \"a mean old hairy guy\" to having \"hi-tech glasses\" before getting to his current design. More inspiration came from \"comic books, Hong Kong movies,\" and other similar media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamershell.com/articles/488.html|title=Hitman 2 Interview|work=Gamershell.com|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002754/http://www.gamershell.com/articles/488.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to game director Rasmus H\u00f8jengaard (Hoejengaard), the idea of a clone whose future is decided by the people that created him, intrigued the Hitman team. Hojengaard felt the idea of creating the \"ultimate assassin\" by cloning \"evolved with the character before the first Hitman game was done\".\n\nThe character of 47 is voiced in the video game series by [[David Bateson]], who was also the basis for 47's appearance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxpe_1YD40A|title=David Bateson Agent 47 Interview|work=YouTube|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n47 is a genetically-enhanced clone, the culmination of decades of secret research into gene augmentation. His creation was funded by a cabal of criminal masterminds who donated their own DNA to the project.\n\nIn the 1950s, five men of various nationalities served in the same unit of the [[French Foreign Legion]]. After their time with the Legion was finished, four of those men returned to their respective countries and constructed their own criminal empires. The remaining one, Dr. Otto Ort-Meyer, ran a mental institution which he used as a cover for genetic experiments. In exchange for research funding, Ort-Meyer provided his former comrades with donor organs harvested from clone bodies, those organs significantly extending their longevity.\n\nThe men whose DNA contributed to 47's creation are often referred to within the series as the \"Five Fathers\", consisting of Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer, Lee Hong, Pablo Ochoa, Franz Fuchs and Arkadij Jegorov. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer is a discredited German scientist living in Romania, whose radical theories were deemed insane by his peers. Ort-Meyer believed that genetic recombination and human cloning could be used to produce a perfected version of the human species, superior in strength and mind and unburdened by conscience. His ultimate goal, unbeknownst to his associates, was to create an army of flawless and unquestioningly obedient supermen. When Ort-Meyer's associates become suspicious of his motives, he employs 47 to systematically eliminate each of them. When 47 discovers Ort-Meyer's plans, he manages to eliminate Ort-Meyer.\n\nOrt-Meyer's research produced many failed attempts, including a clone named Mr. 17, but ultimately he managed to perfect the process enough to produce an assembly line of genetically augmented clones. 47 belonged to Ort-Meyer's fourth series of clones, possessing a 47th chromosome which, combined with DNA harvested from the world's most dangerous criminals, endowed him with levels of strength, speed, stamina, and intelligence significantly above the human norm.\n\nIn ''Hitman: Blood Money'', it is explained that American interests had repeatedly attempted to replicate Ort-Meyer's success, but were largely unsuccessful. 47 is the only successful healthy cloned specimen, and nothing has yet come to parallel him; while other attempts have come close, they were plagued by problems such as albinism and extremely short lifespans (eighteen months). Ort-Meyer's research was distributed among many covert cloning labs, but is insufficient; a sample of 47's bone marrow is needed to fill in the DNA gaps, making him an extremely valuable specimen.\n\nHowever, during  events of ''Hitman'' and ''Hitman 2'', it is revealed that 47 had one final brother, Agent 6, who escaped from the asylum and fled to America under the assumed name of Lucas Grey. Grey has created a domestic terror cell with the expressed purpose of hunting down Providence, the secret society which funded and benefited from Ort-Meyer's experiments. Although 47 is initially assigned to hunt Grey, he soon remembers that he and 6 made a blood pact as children to hunt down those responsible for their creation. With his memory restored, 47 secretly aides in 6's crusade.\n\n==Biography==\nAgent 47's typical attire consists of a black suit, black [[Gloves#Leather gloves|leather gloves]], white dress shirt and a red tie. As the ''Hitman'' video game series allows players the option of engaging in stealth-based strategy to avoid conflict, Agent 47 has the ability to exchange his stock costume (a costume assigned to Agent 47 at the beginning of a level or displayed in a cut scene) with various characters in the game to avoid detection. There are a wide variety of costumes to choose from including police, military, medical and culinary uniforms that are all made available by incapacitating non-player characters and \"stealing\" their clothing.\n\nIn addition to the signature suit, alternative stock costumes are occasionally provided. In ''[[Hitman: Codename 47|Codename 47]]'', he is seen wearing a guerrilla camouflage in the jungle, while in ''Silent Assassin'' Agent 47 wears a protective [[anorak]] in the Japanese mountains and a blue turban in Afghanistan. At the end of [[Hitman: Blood Money|''Blood Money'']], Agent 47 wears a white suit and white gloves while he is placed into a coffin during his funeral.\n\nIn addition to clothing, Agent 47's distinctive choice of weaponry plays an important role in his appearance. He prefers to use a pair of silver customized [[AMT Hardballer]]s, a [[M1911]] clone, nicknamed \"Silverballers.\" Following the third video game in the series, ''[[Hitman: Contracts]]'', the ''Hitman'' symbol replaces the Silverballer logos that are typically printed on the side of the pistol's slide. Throughout the franchise, the Silverballers serve as Agent 47's signature weapon, along with his fiber wire black [[garrote]], appearing in every game of the series.\n\n[[File:Hitmancodigo.png|thumb|left|47's barcode as based on images from Dr. Ort-Meyer's journal.]]Agent 47 is completely bald with very pale skin and blue eyes with dark eyebrows. His [[International Contract Agency]] (ICA) file from ''[[Hitman: Absolution]]'' states his height as {{height|m=1.88}}.<ref>Hitman: Absolution: Trailer \u201eICA File 5 \u2013 Agent 47\u201c; ([http://cdn-thumbs.viddler.com/thumbnail_2_6d7486f4_v3.jpg photo 1 from trailer], [http://i1-games.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/Hitman-Absolution-Agent-47-ICA-File-Trailer_1.jpg photo 2 from trailer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233801/http://i1-games.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/Hitman-Absolution-Agent-47-ICA-File-Trailer_1.jpg |date=2013-12-30 }}).</ref> In ''[[Hitman: Enemy Within]]'', his weight is given as {{convert|85|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref>William C. Dietz: ''Hitman: Enemy Within'', 2007, Del Rey Books, {{ISBN|978-0-345-47132-1}}, page 12.</ref> It is apparent that 47 grows older, evident by the added wrinkles through the course of the first four games. He significantly aged in Absolution, with many wrinkles on his face, him performing certain actions slower and other reduced abilities. This is retconned in ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|HITMAN\u2122]]'' as 47 appears much younger, with him looking exactly the same in the game's main sections and prologue which takes place 20 years ago, when he was inducted into the ICA. A medical report on 47 in-game states that although 47 is in his 50s, his body is still in peak condition as if he is 20\u201330 years old, and he has no possibilities of developing a disease. Since players of the video game series control the character from a third person perspective, the barcode that is tattooed on the back of his head is starkly prominent, although in ''Hitman: Absolution'', he has the tattoo covered by a bandage for most of the game, after he removes it in an attempt to disguise himself.\n\nHis barcode acts as a security key to access areas of the facility where he was created and trained. 47's barcode is implied to be in [[Code 39]]; according to Dr. Ort-Meyer's journal, the barcode was added to the tattoo in 1975, one year after the code was developed. Curiously, the other characters in the games appear oblivious to the conspicuous tattoo. A newspaper's description of 47 in ''Hitman: Blood Money'' fails to mention the barcode as a notable characteristic. The barcode is however referenced in ''Hitman: Absolution'' as the only distinguishing feature 47 has, and that while others do notice it, the description of a bald man in a suit with a barcode tattoo is simply too vague to be useful to law enforcement.\n\n===Early life===\nFrom ages five to seven, 47 was quiet and showed little social interaction. His only display of affection was towards a runaway laboratory rabbit he adopted on August 21, 1970, displeasing Dr. Ort-Meyer. However it died on May 2, 1972. Ort-Meyer noticed 47 crying and was surprised, as he'd never seen any of his clones do so before. Five years later, he also showed affection to a pet mouse. He cared for the mouse for about a month, until it was killed by a fellow clone as a cruel prank.\n\n47 was bullied by another clone in 1977, which was part of the 6 series. They were both 12 years old. After watching a [[kickboxing]] tournament held by Ort-Meyer for his friends and colleagues, he killed the clone in a toilet stall by choking him to death and left his face submerged in the toilet. To escape the asylum, he made a fiber wire out of a windowsill and broken parts of a broom, oiled squeaky door hinges to sneak out, and stashed a bow and arrow to kill a guard dog before he jumped the gate.\n\nHe hitchhiked his way into a Romanian town, without money. He first noticed luxury clothing stores. Later, an asylum doctor found him at a bus stop and rewarded him with a pancake breakfast. He explained to 47 that he was right to kill that series 6 clone and had done a good job of it, but should in the future only kill when instructed to do so.\n\nBetween ages thirteen and twenty-three (1978\u20131987), 47 began a fairly negative relationship with the asylum staff, attributed to his chronic uneasiness stemming from his regular medical checkups and frequent injections. On one occasion, 47 stabbed a doctor repeatedly with several needles, thus, prompting Dr. Ort-Meyer to assign more security for 47.\n\n===Training===\nAlong with the other clones, 47 was trained from youth to become a silent assassin. He was instructed in the use of firearms, military hardware, unarmed combat, the use of disguises, and the use of more classical tools of assassination like the infamous fiber wire and poisons. During his training in Romania, he was noted for his exceptional marksmanship, as well as for attacking the asylum staff with homemade slingshots, all of which were promptly confiscated. Along with learning how to use the tools of an assassin, 47 was trained to analyze and adapt to his surroundings when planning an assassination, allowing him to see multiple paths for which he could eliminate his targets silently and efficiently. He also shot smiley faces into targets when he was bored. This is one of the only possible examples of 47 being exposed to pop culture, although all of the clones were sufficiently educated about the outside world by using traditional school textbooks.\n\n===Escape===\nOn September 5, 1989, Dr. Ort-Meyer went so far as to remember 47's twenty-fifth birthday in his journal, although 47 himself didn't, along with comments that he had become \"mature\" and stopped many of his bad habits. In 1993 he stated that 47, now almost thirty, had passed every test he can think of and is his most skilled clone.\n\nAs Dr. Ort-Meyer's friends grew weary of funding him with little results, relations between them soured. Dr. Ort-Meyer sometimes blatantly hinted that he would use the clones against them if he felt necessary. Ort-Meyer initiated this plan by purposely creating a gap in the asylum's security for 47 to escape. Having watched 47's every move, Dr. Ort-Meyer was very pleased with 47's performance (despite the fact that 47 killed one of his security guards for a disguise) and concluded that his training was complete.\n\n===Employment===\nAccording to 47's ICA file from the ''[[Hitman: Absolution]]'' trailers, the International Contract Agency first took an interest in 47's activities in 1998 and enrolled him in 2000. [[Hitman (2016 video game)|''Hitman'' (2016)]] chronicles how 47 came to join the ICA \u2013 they had been impressed by his previous work as a freelance assassin, and requested to \"test\" and audition him. Agent 47 arrived at an ICA training facility and was greeted by fellow trainee Diana Burnwood. 47 went through and passed rigorous training programs, psychological evaluations, and a thorough background check, although they found very little about 47's previous life.\n\nWhile Burnwood believed that 47 would be an invaluable asset to the ICA, Erich Soders, the facility's training director, was very reluctant to recruit 47 because of how little they knew about him, telling Diana, \"Frankly, it's as if the earth just spat him out.\" Soders suspected 47 of lying about coming from a Romanian asylum, because 47 covered his tracks perfectly.\n\nSoders grew displeased with this lack of information on Agent 47's background, there was nothing from 47's past that ICA could use as leverage against him, and administered the strictest possible tests on 47 in hopes of being able to reject him. Learning of this plot Diana also chooses to \"bend the rules\" and assists 47 to pass his audition. 47 was then made a full agent of ICA and Diana Burnwood was assigned to him as his handler.\n\nWith a lifetime of training and genetically augmented physical abilities, Agent 47 swiftly rose to become the Agency's most efficient, and most requested assassin. Immediately after the success of his first contract kill, he was later awarded the rank Gamma. As he has little to no memory of his background, he dedicated his life to be a skilled assassin which provided him with a lifestyle of adventure and luxury.\n\nDespite the threat however, he continued with the I.C.A. until the events of ''[[Hitman: Blood Money]]'', during which the organization is destroyed. At the end of that game the I.C.A. is rebuilt. The last scene depicts Agent 47 walking into a shop, using a fake name and asking what they have to sell \"preferably in the back,\" suggesting that he has resumed his career at either the I.C.A. or a competing organized criminal organization.\n\nIn  ''[[Hitman: Absolution]]'' it is confirmed that he is still an employee of the ICA, but his employment was put on hiatus once again. He is hunted by ICA official Benjamin Travis and his men, who labeled 47 and Diana as traitors because the latter took Victoria, product of his cloning project. At the end of the game, it is revealed that Travis was corrupt and acting without his superior's orders and 47 kills him, everything turns out to be an elaborate plot of Diana trying to rid Travis\u2019 influence as well as his clone project. 47 and Diana then resumed their career at the ICA.\n\nIt is shown in  ''Hitman'' (2016) that he and Diana still serve with the ICA.\n\n===Personality===\nHis absolute highest priority is completing his contract. He will sacrifice innocents if he must, but he will kill the target (although it remains a part of his dedication to professionalism to avoid any unnecessary collateral). He is emotionally closed off to the suffering of others when appropriate on a contract, even if they remind him of himself at a younger age. He is very quiet and monotone to the point of being socially awkward, which is perhaps the biggest of his very few weaknesses. Nevertheless, he can blend into the crowd and play the role of a regular person very effectively and efficiently. He is content with being alone, but has a deep if unexpressed admiration for the few people he becomes close to, especially Diana Burnwood, Father Emilio Vittorio, Helen McAdams, Victoria and Tommy Clemenza. Agent 47 also shows uncharacteristic sensitivity towards animals that he keeps as pets, such as his childhood rabbit and mouse he found from the asylum itself, and the yellow canary in ''[[Hitman: Blood Money]]'' (though he is not hesitant to kill it in the cut-scene before ''Requiem'' in order to avoid giving his position away). He very rarely shows the same care towards human beings, though notable exceptions include Mei Ling, Father Vittorio and Victoria (whom 47 and Diana treat sort of like a daughter). He also expressed his disgust at exploiting innocent people, as mentioned during the briefing in Death Factory, when he lamented at how Travis and Blake Dexter used \"children as weapons\".\n\nAgent 47 approaches his assassinations with professionalism but will, however, not show any hesitation or remorse when it comes to killing or silencing witnesses and other potential threats to his mission. Agent 47 generally speaks in a monotone, proper, non-threatening tone, rarely swearing, or even raising his voice. 47 also has a blank and somewhat sinister facial expression, often scanning the scene with his eyes; the only other facial expression 47 has been known to show is pain. He also occasionally smirks in the 2007 movie adaptation. Agent 47 seems to also be an accomplished conversationalist despite the fact he's extremely reserved, often able to fool and manipulate people with convincing lies and bluffs. ''Hitman: Enemy Within'' shows that he has the capability to act far out of his normal personality to imitate people, such as a cocky womanizing biker.\n\nBoth ''Hitman'' novels as well as some portions of ''Hitman: Absolution'' show a side of 47 he rarely shows. When out of his element or not on assignment, 47 occasionally shows behavior similar to ordinary people. In ''Hitman: Enemy Within'', he is shown cursing when under frustration, as well as rarely sharing jokes with Diana. But more often than not, he prefers to share little words and keeps to himself.\n\nGiven his fee, Agent 47 would have to be a multi-millionaire from his contract earnings but never stops going for new contracts. He only spends his money on simple things like food, suits, gear, and shelter, although he is also known to donate some of it to Father Vittorio. He does have a particular taste for expensive clothing (it is implied in ''Blood Money'' and ''Absolution'' that all his suits are custom-tailored) and fine dining.\n\nKnowing this it can be determined that 47 does his work as a hitman for more than just money, but for purpose in life. This is further demonstrated when he did not retrieve the ten million dollar ransom suitcase Blake Dexter had, when he eliminated him but instead let Victoria dump the money on Dexter's body and fly off into the breeze. It is stated that he has to work as a hitman, since trying to live a \"normal\" life will endanger those around him, such as what happened in the second game, showing he does show concern to other human beings.\n\n===Morality===\nEven though 47 is a relatively emotionless assassin, he shows signs of morality. In ''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin'', he is seen confessing his sins to Father Vittorio. Subsequently, he is also depressed at the apparent loss of his spiritual guide that he agrees to take on the \"suicide mission\" of killing Deewana Ji. The novels often have him pondering the question of his own morality and values. In ''Hitman: Absolution'', 47 initially goes through with his contract to eliminate his former handler Diana Burnwood after she exposed the ICA and went into hiding, shooting her before she has the chance to explain herself. Watching her wounded on the ground, 47 hesitated to finish her and demanded how she could do such a thing. Telling him that she needed to take the young clone Victoria away from the doctors, 47 agrees to keep Victoria safe.\n\n===Abilities===\nAs a class one type clone, 47 was genetically enhanced in order to perform physical tasks much more efficiently than an average human. He has heightened combat skills, speed, reflexes, strength and stamina (he is apparently able to run 10&nbsp;km (6.2 miles) in 36 minutes and 39 seconds) in as well as an effective metabolism and some form of limited healing power. His healing powers are efficient enough to help him recover from a gunshot in a few hours despite him needing some medical attention in order to have the bullet removed and the pain suppressed with some painkillers, as seen in ''Hitman: Contracts''. 47 has mastered the art of stealth, being able to terminate multiple enemies in the same area one at a time and sneak up on almost anybody and quietly neutralize them. 47 also has an expert level understanding in the use of disguises in order to access unauthorized areas of a location. He is physically strong even when compared to adult males of his size and build in peak condition; being able to climb pipes, move, drag and dispose of bodies, snap necks, knock opponents unconscious, and jump from balcony to balcony with minimum effort. It is evident that 47 is a very skilled driver, judging from how well he managed to maneuver Dr. Ort-Meyer's car past a police blockade (in rainy conditions) at the end of 'Asylum Aftermath', the first mission in ''Hitman: Contracts''. 47's driving skill is also manifested in his ability to drive specialist motor vehicles, such as a bus and a large truck at the end of the mission 'Amendment XXV' in ''Blood Money'' and 'The Meat King's Party' in ''Contracts'', respectively. 47's vehicular skills are not just limited to cars: he is seen flying helicopters and planes and driving boats numerous times throughout the series. To keep in his physical condition and also keep his skills in balance, 47 practices his combat, shooting, assassination, and stealth skills whenever he is not on an assignment.\n\nTrained extensively in armed and unarmed combat and in the use of improvised weapons, such as explosives, sniper rifles, automatic weapons and bladed weapons, 47 is fully adept at surveying his environment and using it to his advantage. Highlighted in ''Hitman: Enemy Within'' and ''Hitman: Absolution'', 47 is an expert in hand-to-hand combat. From a young age, 47 was trained with his fellow clones to master kickboxing. 47 was an above average fighter, losing only to clone number 6. In ''Hitman: Blood Money'', he can disarm trained and armed soldiers with ease, as well as render people unconscious with minimal effort. In ''Hitman: Absolution'', he is skilled enough to engage several armed enemies unarmed and survive. He also shows his skill in martial arts when he is able to beat a genetically altered giant Sanchez in a one on one fight. He is also resourceful enough to maintain anonymity by avoiding leaving forensic evidence for law enforcement agencies to discover through various methods. 47 is skilled in infiltration, as seen in the trailer for ''Hitman: Absolution'' when he must enter Diana Burnwood's mansion to kill her, ex-filtration, and evasion, as well as the traditional art of assassination as seen when carrying out contracts. On site, he can slip past guards without arousing too much suspicion. He is a perfect marksman, so well that the newspaper in ''Hitman: Blood Money'' called him \"Legendary Agent 47\".\n\n47 also has a detailed understanding of human anatomy and human nature, shown through his use of poisons, and sedatives, as well as striking vital points when strangling targets silently or using hand-to-hand combat. He also knows how best to move throughout an area without catching the attention of civilians or armed guards. He knows exactly what parts of the human body to shoot that would be a survivable shot, a fatal shot or even a slow painful shot which 47 has used to interrogate one of his victims. He is also able to face multiple enemies unarmed and survive the encounter unharmed.\n\nWhatever the odds, 47 never panics. He always keeps his composure and clear mind to the point of being perfectly aware of all his surroundings and constantly calculates his every action, never losing focus.\n\n===Reputation===\nOver the years, 47 had gained a near mythical reputation of being the world's deadliest hit man, with most people believing that he actually doesn't exist. Due to his successful track record, 47 is usually given the Agency's largest, most complex and most difficult assignments. He completes all of his assignments with unwavering accuracy, fulfilling all of his objectives and unfailingly eliminating his targets. 47's stealth and cunning are so perfect that 47's existence in the I.C.A. became legendary; he is regarded by the world as an [[urban legend]] of a \"mysterious assassin\", and very few know of his appearance (fewer people even know that he exists). He is also given the gamma status by the ICA for his accomplishments as an assassin.\nThe degree of 47's professionalism is such that in the trailer sequence that plays on the title screen of ''Blood Money'', the speaker states that once a client has contracted 47 to perform an assassination, he cannot be called off and will fulfill the contract through to the end no matter the difficulty or the victim itself, even if the client changes their mind, meaning that the client must be absolutely certain of their desire to have the contract fulfilled before they request 47 themselves from the Agency. It also has been noted that 47 is the most expensive assassin offered by the I.C.A., and that his assignments have been among the Agency's most lucrative.\n\n===Living quarters===\n47's hideout is unknown, and it's unknown where it is, or actually how many hideouts he owns. They are often portrayed to be run-down buildings. He operated out of Father Vittorio's church in ''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin''. In ''Hitman: Contracts'', while the game is predominately flashbacks, 47 is staying at a hotel in Paris, where he is recuperating after being shot. In ''Hitman: Blood Money'', his primary hideout seemed to be in a sewer, with a single laptop to maintain contact with the I.C.A., a shooting range and an armory, and a single rusty bed.\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2012, [[GamesRadar+]] ranked Agent 47 as 47th \"most memorable, influential, and badass\" protagonist in video games.<ref>[http://www.gamesradar.com/top-100-video-game-heroes/ Agent 47 - 100 best heroes in video games] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Cjs4P0ou?url=http://www.gamesradar.com/top-100-video-game-heroes/ |date=2012-12-07 }}, GamesRadar, October 19, 2012</ref> He is regarded by GamesRadar+, ''[[FHM]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', ''[[Play (UK magazine)|Play]]'', and [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] as one of the best assassins in video games.<ref>Gelo Gonzales, [http://www.fhm.com.ph/entertainment/games/the-5-most-memorable-hitmen-in-gaming The 5 most memorable hitmen in gaming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129165441/http://www.fhm.com.ph/entertainment/games/the-5-most-memorable-hitmen-in-gaming |date=2014-11-29 }}, ''FHM'', November 26, 2009</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-top-7-assassins/?page=2 |title=The Top 7...

He appears in all mainline games in the series, comics that are published by [[Dynamite Entertainment]], and two live action films. The character first appeared in ''[[Hitman: Codename 47]]'' (2000) and most recently in [[Hitman 2 (2018 video game)|''Hitman 2'']] (2018).\n\n47 is a paid assassin (a [[hitman]]) and a [[Human cloning|clone]]. He gets his name from being the forty-seventh clone created from the [[DNA]] of five different men. These clones were made to be perfect assassins who could easily maintain peak physicality and intelligence, while easily being controlled by whoever they were devoted to, usually a [[Agent handling|handler]]. As 47, the player gets to travel the world and execute hits on individuals, while trying to be as stealthy as possible. This includes taking disguises, using aliases, and using silenced weaponry.\n \nThe character of Agent 47 has been well received by critics and has become a well known video game character since his inception in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-lists/50-most-iconic-video-game-characters-of-the-21st-century-193057/46-tommy-vercetti-104218/|title=50 Most Iconic Video Game Characters of the 21st Century|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2019-02-28|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Concept and creation==\nAccording to Jacob Andersen, lead designer of ''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin'', Agent 47 went from being \"a mean old hairy guy\" to having \"hi-tech glasses\" before getting to his current design. More inspiration came from \"comic books, Hong Kong movies,\" and other similar media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamershell.com/articles/488.html|title=Hitman 2 Interview|work=Gamershell.com|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002754/http://www.gamershell.com/articles/488.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to game director Rasmus H\u00f8jengaard (Hoejengaard), the idea of a clone whose future is decided by the people that created him, intrigued the Hitman team. Hojengaard felt the idea of creating the \"ultimate assassin\" by cloning \"evolved with the character before the first Hitman game was done\".\n\nThe character of 47 is voiced in the video game series by [[David Bateson]], who was also the basis for 47's appearance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxpe_1YD40A|title=David Bateson Agent 47 Interview|work=YouTube|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n47 is a genetically-enhanced clone, the culmination of decades of secret research into gene augmentation. His creation was funded by a cabal of criminal masterminds who donated their own DNA to the project.\n\nIn the 1950s, five men of various nationalities served in the same unit of the [[French Foreign Legion]]. After their time with the Legion was finished, four of those men returned to their respective countries and constructed their own criminal empires. The remaining one, Dr. Otto Ort-Meyer, ran a mental institution which he used as a cover for genetic experiments. In exchange for research funding, Ort-Meyer provided his former comrades with donor organs harvested from clone bodies, those organs significantly extending their longevity.\n\nThe men whose DNA contributed to 47's creation are often referred to within the series as the \"Five Fathers\", consisting of Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer, Lee Hong, Pablo Ochoa, Franz Fuchs and Arkadij Jegorov. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer is a discredited German scientist living in Romania, whose radical theories were deemed insane by his peers. Ort-Meyer believed that genetic recombination and human cloning could be used to produce a perfected version of the human species, superior in strength and mind and unburdened by conscience. His ultimate goal, unbeknownst to his associates, was to create an army of flawless and unquestioningly obedient supermen. When Ort-Meyer's associates become suspicious of his motives, he employs 47 to systematically eliminate each of them. When 47 discovers Ort-Meyer's plans, he manages to eliminate Ort-Meyer.\n\nOrt-Meyer's research produced many failed attempts, including a clone named Mr. 17, but ultimately he managed to perfect the process enough to produce an assembly line of genetically augmented clones. 47 belonged to Ort-Meyer's fourth series of clones, possessing a 47th chromosome which, combined with DNA harvested from the world's most dangerous criminals, endowed him with levels of strength, speed, stamina, and intelligence significantly above the human norm.\n\nIn ''Hitman: Blood Money'', it is explained that American interests had repeatedly attempted to replicate Ort-Meyer's success, but were largely unsuccessful. 47 is the only successful healthy cloned specimen, and nothing has yet come to parallel him; while other attempts have come close, they were plagued by problems such as albinism and extremely short lifespans (eighteen months). Ort-Meyer's research was distributed among many covert cloning labs, but is insufficient; a sample of 47's bone marrow is needed to fill in the DNA gaps, making him an extremely valuable specimen.\n\nHowever, during  events of ''Hitman'' and ''Hitman 2'', it is revealed that 47 had one final brother, Agent 6, who escaped from the asylum and fled to America under the assumed name of Lucas Grey. Grey has created a domestic terror cell with the expressed purpose of hunting down Providence, the secret society which funded and benefited from Ort-Meyer's experiments. Although 47 is initially assigned to hunt Grey, he soon remembers that he and 6 made a blood pact as children to hunt down those responsible for their creation. With his memory restored, 47 secretly aides in 6's crusade.\n\n==Biography==\nAgent 47's typical attire consists of a black suit, black [[Gloves#Leather gloves|leather gloves]], white dress shirt and a red tie. As the ''Hitman'' video game series allows players the option of engaging in stealth-based strategy to avoid conflict, Agent 47 has the ability to exchange his stock costume (a costume assigned to Agent 47 at the beginning of a level or displayed in a cut scene) with various characters in the game to avoid detection. There are a wide variety of costumes to choose from including police, military, medical and culinary uniforms that are all made available by incapacitating non-player characters and \"stealing\" their clothing.\n\nIn addition to the signature suit, alternative stock costumes are occasionally provided. In ''[[Hitman: Codename 47|Codename 47]]'', he is seen wearing a guerrilla camouflage in the jungle, while in ''Silent Assassin'' Agent 47 wears a protective [[anorak]] in the Japanese mountains and a blue turban in Afghanistan. At the end of [[Hitman: Blood Money|''Blood Money'']], Agent 47 wears a white suit and white gloves while he is placed into a coffin during his funeral.\n\nIn addition to clothing, Agent 47's distinctive choice of weaponry plays an important role in his appearance. He prefers to use a pair of silver customized [[AMT Hardballer]]s, a [[M1911]] clone, nicknamed \"Silverballers.\" Following the third video game in the series, ''[[Hitman: Contracts]]'', the ''Hitman'' symbol replaces the Silverballer logos that are typically printed on the side of the pistol's slide. Throughout the franchise, the Silverballers serve as Agent 47's signature weapon, along with his fiber wire black [[garrote]], appearing in every game of the series.\n\n[[File:Hitmancodigo.png|thumb|left|47's barcode as based on images from Dr. Ort-Meyer's journal.]]Agent 47 is completely bald with very pale skin and blue eyes with dark eyebrows. His [[International Contract Agency]] (ICA) file from ''[[Hitman: Absolution]]'' states his height as {{height|m=1.88}}.<ref>Hitman: Absolution: Trailer \u201eICA File 5 \u2013 Agent 47\u201c; ([http://cdn-thumbs.viddler.com/thumbnail_2_6d7486f4_v3.jpg photo 1 from trailer], [http://i1-games.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/Hitman-Absolution-Agent-47-ICA-File-Trailer_1.jpg photo 2 from trailer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233801/http://i1-games.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/Hitman-Absolution-Agent-47-ICA-File-Trailer_1.jpg |date=2013-12-30 }}).</ref> In ''[[Hitman: Enemy Within]]'', his weight is given as {{convert|85|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref>William C. Dietz: ''Hitman: Enemy Within'', 2007, Del Rey Books, {{ISBN|978-0-345-47132-1}}, page 12.</ref> It is apparent that 47 grows older, evident by the added wrinkles through the course of the first four games. He significantly aged in Absolution, with many wrinkles on his face, him performing certain actions slower and other reduced abilities. This is retconned in ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|HITMAN\u2122]]'' as 47 appears much younger, with him looking exactly the same in the game's main sections and prologue which takes place 20 years ago, when he was inducted into the ICA. A medical report on 47 in-game states that although 47 is in his 50s, his body is still in peak condition as if he is 20\u201330 years old, and he has no possibilities of developing a disease. Since players of the video game series control the character from a third person perspective, the barcode that is tattooed on the back of his head is starkly prominent, although in ''Hitman: Absolution'', he has the tattoo covered by a bandage for most of the game, after he removes it in an attempt to disguise himself.\n\nHis barcode acts as a security key to access areas of the facility where he was created and trained. 47's barcode is implied to be in [[Code 39]]; according to Dr. Ort-Meyer's journal, the barcode was added to the tattoo in 1975, one year after the code was developed. Curiously, the other characters in the games appear oblivious to the conspicuous tattoo. A newspaper's description of 47 in ''Hitman: Blood Money'' fails to mention the barcode as a notable characteristic. The barcode is however referenced in ''Hitman: Absolution'' as the only distinguishing feature 47 has, and that while others do notice it, the description of a bald man in a suit with a barcode tattoo is simply too vague to be useful to law enforcement.\n\n===Early life===\nFrom ages five to seven, 47 was quiet and showed little social interaction. His only display of affection was towards a runaway laboratory rabbit he adopted on August 21, 1970, displeasing Dr. Ort-Meyer. However it died on May 2, 1972. Ort-Meyer noticed 47 crying and was surprised, as he'd never seen any of his clones do so before. Five years later, he also showed affection to a pet mouse. He cared for the mouse for about a month, until it was killed by a fellow clone as a cruel prank.\n\n47 was bullied by another clone in 1977, which was part of the 6 series. They were both 12 years old. After watching a [[kickboxing]] tournament held by Ort-Meyer for his friends and colleagues, he killed the clone in a toilet stall by choking him to death and left his face submerged in the toilet. To escape the asylum, he made a fiber wire out of a windowsill and broken parts of a broom, oiled squeaky door hinges to sneak out, and stashed a bow and arrow to kill a guard dog before he jumped the gate.\n\nHe hitchhiked his way into a Romanian town, without money. He first noticed luxury clothing stores. Later, an asylum doctor found him at a bus stop and rewarded him with a pancake breakfast. He explained to 47 that he was right to kill that series 6 clone and had done a good job of it, but should in the future only kill when instructed to do so.\n\nBetween ages thirteen and twenty-three (1978\u20131987), 47 began a fairly negative relationship with the asylum staff, attributed to his chronic uneasiness stemming from his regular medical checkups and frequent injections. On one occasion, 47 stabbed a doctor repeatedly with several needles, thus, prompting Dr. Ort-Meyer to assign more security for 47.\n\n===Training===\nAlong with the other clones, 47 was trained from youth to become a silent assassin. He was instructed in the use of firearms, military hardware, unarmed combat, the use of disguises, and the use of more classical tools of assassination like the infamous fiber wire and poisons. During his training in Romania, he was noted for his exceptional marksmanship, as well as for attacking the asylum staff with homemade slingshots, all of which were promptly confiscated. Along with learning how to use the tools of an assassin, 47 was trained to analyze and adapt to his surroundings when planning an assassination, allowing him to see multiple paths for which he could eliminate his targets silently and efficiently. He also shot smiley faces into targets when he was bored. This is one of the only possible examples of 47 being exposed to pop culture, although all of the clones were sufficiently educated about the outside world by using traditional school textbooks.\n\n===Escape===\nOn September 5, 1989, Dr. Ort-Meyer went so far as to remember 47's twenty-fifth birthday in his journal, although 47 himself didn't, along with comments that he had become \"mature\" and stopped many of his bad habits. In 1993 he stated that 47, now almost thirty, had passed every test he can think of and is his most skilled clone.\n\nAs Dr. Ort-Meyer's friends grew weary of funding him with little results, relations between them soured. Dr. Ort-Meyer sometimes blatantly hinted that he would use the clones against them if he felt necessary. Ort-Meyer initiated this plan by purposely creating a gap in the asylum's security for 47 to escape. Having watched 47's every move, Dr. Ort-Meyer was very pleased with 47's performance (despite the fact that 47 killed one of his security guards for a disguise) and concluded that his training was complete.\n\n===Employment===\nAccording to 47's ICA file from the ''[[Hitman: Absolution]]'' trailers, the International Contract Agency first took an interest in 47's activities in 1998 and enrolled him in 2000. [[Hitman (2016 video game)|''Hitman'' (2016)]] chronicles how 47 came to join the ICA \u2013 they had been impressed by his previous work as a freelance assassin, and requested to \"test\" and audition him. Agent 47 arrived at an ICA training facility and was greeted by fellow trainee Diana Burnwood. 47 went through and passed rigorous training programs, psychological evaluations, and a thorough background check, although they found very little about 47's previous life.\n\nWhile Burnwood believed that 47 would be an invaluable asset to the ICA, Erich Soders, the facility's training director, was very reluctant to recruit 47 because of how little they knew about him, telling Diana, \"Frankly, it's as if the earth just spat him out.\" Soders suspected 47 of lying about coming from a Romanian asylum, because 47 covered his tracks perfectly.\n\nSoders grew displeased with this lack of information on Agent 47's background, there was nothing from 47's past that ICA could use as leverage against him, and administered the strictest possible tests on 47 in hopes of being able to reject him. Learning of this plot Diana also chooses to \"bend the rules\" and assists 47 to pass his audition. 47 was then made a full agent of ICA and Diana Burnwood was assigned to him as his handler.\n\nWith a lifetime of training and genetically augmented physical abilities, Agent 47 swiftly rose to become the Agency's most efficient, and most requested assassin. Immediately after the success of his first contract kill, he was later awarded the rank Gamma. As he has little to no memory of his background, he dedicated his life to be a skilled assassin which provided him with a lifestyle of adventure and luxury.\n\nDespite the threat however, he continued with the I.C.A. until the events of ''[[Hitman: Blood Money]]'', during which the organization is destroyed. At the end of that game the I.C.A. is rebuilt. The last scene depicts Agent 47 walking into a shop, using a fake name and asking what they have to sell \"preferably in the back,\" suggesting that he has resumed his career at either the I.C.A. or a competing organized criminal organization.\n\nIn  ''[[Hitman: Absolution]]'' it is confirmed that he is still an employee of the ICA, but his employment was put on hiatus once again. He is hunted by ICA official Benjamin Travis and his men, who labeled 47 and Diana as traitors because the latter took Victoria, product of his cloning project. At the end of the game, it is revealed that Travis was corrupt and acting without his superior's orders and 47 kills him, everything turns out to be an elaborate plot of Diana trying to rid Travis\u2019 influence as well as his clone project. 47 and Diana then resumed their career at the ICA.\n\nIt is shown in  ''Hitman'' (2016) that he and Diana still serve with the ICA.\n\n===Personality===\nHis absolute highest priority is completing his contract. He will sacrifice innocents if he must, but he will kill the target (although it remains a part of his dedication to professionalism to avoid any unnecessary collateral). He is emotionally closed off to the suffering of others when appropriate on a contract, even if they remind him of himself at a younger age. He is very quiet and monotone to the point of being socially awkward, which is perhaps the biggest of his very few weaknesses. Nevertheless, he can blend into the crowd and play the role of a regular person very effectively and efficiently. He is content with being alone, but has a deep if unexpressed admiration for the few people he becomes close to, especially Diana Burnwood, Father Emilio Vittorio, Helen McAdams, Victoria and Tommy Clemenza. Agent 47 also shows uncharacteristic sensitivity towards animals that he keeps as pets, such as his childhood rabbit and mouse he found from the asylum itself, and the yellow canary in ''[[Hitman: Blood Money]]'' (though he is not hesitant to kill it in the cut-scene before ''Requiem'' in order to avoid giving his position away). He very rarely shows the same care towards human beings, though notable exceptions include Mei Ling, Father Vittorio and Victoria (whom 47 and Diana treat sort of like a daughter). He also expressed his disgust at exploiting innocent people, as mentioned during the briefing in Death Factory, when he lamented at how Travis and Blake Dexter used \"children as weapons\".\n\nAgent 47 approaches his assassinations with professionalism but will, however, not show any hesitation or remorse when it comes to killing or silencing witnesses and other potential threats to his mission. Agent 47 generally speaks in a monotone, proper, non-threatening tone, rarely swearing, or even raising his voice. 47 also has a blank and somewhat sinister facial expression, often scanning the scene with his eyes; the only other facial expression 47 has been known to show is pain. He also occasionally smirks in the 2007 movie adaptation. Agent 47 seems to also be an accomplished conversationalist despite the fact he's extremely reserved, often able to fool and manipulate people with convincing lies and bluffs. ''Hitman: Enemy Within'' shows that he has the capability to act far out of his normal personality to imitate people, such as a cocky womanizing biker.\n\nBoth ''Hitman'' novels as well as some portions of ''Hitman: Absolution'' show a side of 47 he rarely shows. When out of his element or not on assignment, 47 occasionally shows behavior similar to ordinary people. In ''Hitman: Enemy Within'', he is shown cursing when under frustration, as well as rarely sharing jokes with Diana. But more often than not, he prefers to share little words and keeps to himself.\n\nGiven his fee, Agent 47 would have to be a multi-millionaire from his contract earnings but never stops going for new contracts. He only spends his money on simple things like food, suits, gear, and shelter, although he is also known to donate some of it to Father Vittorio. He does have a particular taste for expensive clothing (it is implied in ''Blood Money'' and ''Absolution'' that all his suits are custom-tailored) and fine dining.\n\nKnowing this it can be determined that 47 does his work as a hitman for more than just money, but for purpose in life. This is further demonstrated when he did not retrieve the ten million dollar ransom suitcase Blake Dexter had, when he eliminated him but instead let Victoria dump the money on Dexter's body and fly off into the breeze. It is stated that he has to work as a hitman, since trying to live a \"normal\" life will endanger those around him, such as what happened in the second game, showing he does show concern to other human beings.\n\n===Morality===\nEven though 47 is a relatively emotionless assassin, he shows signs of morality. In ''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin'', he is seen confessing his sins to Father Vittorio. Subsequently, he is also depressed at the apparent loss of his spiritual guide that he agrees to take on the \"suicide mission\" of killing Deewana Ji. The novels often have him pondering the question of his own morality and values. In ''Hitman: Absolution'', 47 initially goes through with his contract to eliminate his former handler Diana Burnwood after she exposed the ICA and went into hiding, shooting her before she has the chance to explain herself. Watching her wounded on the ground, 47 hesitated to finish her and demanded how she could do such a thing. Telling him that she needed to take the young clone Victoria away from the doctors, 47 agrees to keep Victoria safe.\n\n===Abilities===\nAs a class one type clone, 47 was genetically enhanced in order to perform physical tasks much more efficiently than an average human. He has heightened combat skills, speed, reflexes, strength and stamina (he is apparently able to run 10&nbsp;km (6.2 miles) in 36 minutes and 39 seconds) in as well as an effective metabolism and some form of limited healing power. His healing powers are efficient enough to help him recover from a gunshot in a few hours despite him needing some medical attention in order to have the bullet removed and the pain suppressed with some painkillers, as seen in ''Hitman: Contracts''. 47 has mastered the art of stealth, being able to terminate multiple enemies in the same area one at a time and sneak up on almost anybody and quietly neutralize them. 47 also has an expert level understanding in the use of disguises in order to access unauthorized areas of a location. He is physically strong even when compared to adult males of his size and build in peak condition; being able to climb pipes, move, drag and dispose of bodies, snap necks, knock opponents unconscious, and jump from balcony to balcony with minimum effort. It is evident that 47 is a very skilled driver, judging from how well he managed to maneuver Dr. Ort-Meyer's car past a police blockade (in rainy conditions) at the end of 'Asylum Aftermath', the first mission in ''Hitman: Contracts''. 47's driving skill is also manifested in his ability to drive specialist motor vehicles, such as a bus and a large truck at the end of the mission 'Amendment XXV' in ''Blood Money'' and 'The Meat King's Party' in ''Contracts'', respectively. 47's vehicular skills are not just limited to cars: he is seen flying helicopters and planes and driving boats numerous times throughout the series. To keep in his physical condition and also keep his skills in balance, 47 practices his combat, shooting, assassination, and stealth skills whenever he is not on an assignment.\n\nTrained extensively in armed and unarmed combat and in the use of improvised weapons, such as explosives, sniper rifles, automatic weapons and bladed weapons, 47 is fully adept at surveying his environment and using it to his advantage. Highlighted in ''Hitman: Enemy Within'' and ''Hitman: Absolution'', 47 is an expert in hand-to-hand combat. From a young age, 47 was trained with his fellow clones to master kickboxing. 47 was an above average fighter, losing only to clone number 6. In ''Hitman: Blood Money'', he can disarm trained and armed soldiers with ease, as well as render people unconscious with minimal effort. In ''Hitman: Absolution'', he is skilled enough to engage several armed enemies unarmed and survive. He also shows his skill in martial arts when he is able to beat a genetically altered giant Sanchez in a one on one fight. He is also resourceful enough to maintain anonymity by avoiding leaving forensic evidence for law enforcement agencies to discover through various methods. 47 is skilled in infiltration, as seen in the trailer for ''Hitman: Absolution'' when he must enter Diana Burnwood's mansion to kill her, ex-filtration, and evasion, as well as the traditional art of assassination as seen when carrying out contracts. On site, he can slip past guards without arousing too much suspicion. He is a perfect marksman, so well that the newspaper in ''Hitman: Blood Money'' called him \"Legendary Agent 47\".\n\n47 also has a detailed understanding of human anatomy and human nature, shown through his use of poisons, and sedatives, as well as striking vital points when strangling targets silently or using hand-to-hand combat. He also knows how best to move throughout an area without catching the attention of civilians or armed guards. He knows exactly what parts of the human body to shoot that would be a survivable shot, a fatal shot or even a slow painful shot which 47 has used to interrogate one of his victims. He is also able to face multiple enemies unarmed and survive the encounter unharmed.\n\nWhatever the odds, 47 never panics. He always keeps his composure and clear mind to the point of being perfectly aware of all his surroundings and constantly calculates his every action, never losing focus.\n\n===Reputation===\nOver the years, 47 had gained a near mythical reputation of being the world's deadliest hit man, with most people believing that he actually doesn't exist. Due to his successful track record, 47 is usually given the Agency's largest, most complex and most difficult assignments. He completes all of his assignments with unwavering accuracy, fulfilling all of his objectives and unfailingly eliminating his targets. 47's stealth and cunning are so perfect that 47's existence in the I.C.A. became legendary; he is regarded by the world as an [[urban legend]] of a \"mysterious assassin\", and very few know of his appearance (fewer people even know that he exists). He is also given the gamma status by the ICA for his accomplishments as an assassin.\nThe degree of 47's professionalism is such that in the trailer sequence that plays on the title screen of ''Blood Money'', the speaker states that once a client has contracted 47 to perform an assassination, he cannot be called off and will fulfill the contract through to the end no matter the difficulty or the victim itself, even if the client changes their mind, meaning that the client must be absolutely certain of their desire to have the contract fulfilled before they request 47 themselves from the Agency. It also has been noted that 47 is the most expensive assassin offered by the I.C.A., and that his assignments have been among the Agency's most lucrative.\n\n===Living quarters===\n47's hideout is unknown, and it's unknown where it is, or actually how many hideouts he owns. They are often portrayed to be run-down buildings. He operated out of Father Vittorio's church in ''Hitman 2: Silent Assassin''. In ''Hitman: Contracts'', while the game is predominately flashbacks, 47 is staying at a hotel in Paris, where he is recuperating after being shot. In ''Hitman: Blood Money'', his primary hideout seemed to be in a sewer, with a single laptop to maintain contact with the I.C.A., a shooting range and an armory, and a single rusty bed.\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2012, [[GamesRadar+]] ranked Agent 47 as 47th \"most memorable, influential, and badass\" protagonist in video games.<ref>[http://www.gamesradar.com/top-100-video-game-heroes/ Agent 47 - 100 best heroes in video games] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Cjs4P0ou?url=http://www.gamesradar.com/top-100-video-game-heroes/ |date=2012-12-07 }}, GamesRadar, October 19, 2012</ref> He is regarded by GamesRadar+, ''[[FHM]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', ''[[Play (UK magazine)|Play]]'', and [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] as one of the best assassins in video games.<ref>Gelo Gonzales, [http://www.fhm.com.ph/entertainment/games/the-5-most-memorable-hitmen-in-gaming The 5 most memorable hitmen in gaming] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129165441/http://www.fhm.com.ph/entertainment/games/the-5-most-memorable-hitmen-in-gaming |date=2014-11-29 }}, ''FHM'', November 26, 2009</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-top-7-assassins/?page=2 |title=The Top 7...

In this action the 2nd Battalion undertook a fierce rear-guard defence out-manned and out-gunned by superior numbers of enemy. The 2nd Battalion held their defensive position despite losing their commanding officer, Lt. Col. C.A.H. Brett DSO, at the commencement of the action and their second in command, Maj. E.C.

At length an overwhelming force rushed the 2nd Battalion from the rear, bringing down all resistance and the 2nd's defence of Le Cateau was at an end.

This fight-to-the-last-man defence at Le Cateau was later recognised as a key factor in preventing the German occupation of Paris. The battalion, due to the casualties sustained, was transferred to GHQ Troops before, on 25 October, transferring to the [[8th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|8th Brigade]] of the [[3rd Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]] and, almost a year later, transferred to [[76th Brigade (United Kingdom)|76th Brigade]] of the same division, where they were to remain for the rest of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/3div.htm|title=The 3rd Division in 1914-1918|publisher=The Long, Long Trail|accessdate=24 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Territorial Force====\n\nThe 1/4th Battalion landed at Le Havre as part of the [[3rd (Lahore) Division|Jullundur Brigade]] of the [[3rd (Lahore) Division]] in November 1914 for service on the Western Front.<ref name=trail/> The 1/5th Battalion landed at [[Suvla|Suvla Bay]] as part of the [[163rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|163rd (1/1st Norfolk and Suffolk) Brigade]] in the [[54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division|54th (East Anglian) Division]] in August 1915; it was evacuated from [[Gallipoli]] in December 1915 and moved to Egypt and saw action again at [[First Battle of Gaza]] in March 1917.<ref name=trail/>\n\n====Hostilities-only battalions====\n[[File:The British Army on the Western Front, 1914-1918 Q6097.jpg|thumb|right|Men of the 7th (Service) Battalion, Suffolk Regiment, in the ruins of the church in Tilloy, France, 18 October 1917.]]\n[[File:Miniature of Captain Vesey O'Davoren presented January 15 1916 by the artist John Morley.jpg|thumb|Miniature portrait of the 7th Battalion's Captain [[Vesey Alfred Davoren|Vesey Davoren]] (1888-1989), in uniform, presented to him on January 15 1916, by the artist John Morley.]]\nThe 7th (Service) Battalion landed at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] as part of the [[35th Brigade (United Kingdom)|35th Brigade]] in the [[12th (Eastern) Division]] in May 1915 for action on the Western Front.<ref>''War Diary - 7th Battalion Suffolk Regiment, 13 October 1915'', reporting on action (machine-gun carnage) on the [[Hohenzollern Redoubt]] on October 11th: \nOfficers Killed: Major Currey (Vere Fortrey), (\"an unsurpassed linguist\", killed commanding \u2018B\u2019 Company in the first attack upon the south side of the \u201cHair-pin\u201d); Captain Cobbold (Charles Augustus), a pre-war director of the brewing magnates [[Allied Breweries|Ind, Coope and Co.]]; [[Charles Sorley|Captain Sorley]] (Charles Hamilton); Lt Gedge (Peter); Lt Wood (Geoffrey Dayrell), (played one 1st class cricket match, Oxford v MCC); 2/Lt Hartopp (Charles William Liddell); 2/Lt Lee (Richard); severely wounded: 2/Lt Smith (Donald Claude) died that day.

The next four years were spent training in the [[United Kingdom]] for the [[invasion of Normandy]] in 1944, otherwise known as [[Normandy landings|D-Day]]. The 1st Battalion, under the command of [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Richard Elton Goodwin|Richard E.

Both battalions were assigned to the [[54th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|54th Infantry Brigade]], which included the 4th [[Royal Norfolk Regiment]], assigned to the [[18th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|18th Infantry Division]], a 2nd Line duplicate of the [[54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division]]. Despite being a 2nd Line formation, the 18th Division contained many 1st Line units. The division spent the early years of the war in the defence of England and guarding against a possible [[Operation Sea Lion|German invasion]] after the bulk of the British Army was [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated at Dunkirk]]. In late 1941 the 18th Division, the 4th and 5th Suffolks included, were originally to be sent to Egypt but instead were sent to Singapore to help strengthen the garrison there after Japan entered the war in December 1941. In early 1942, both the 4th and 5th battalions fought briefly in the [[Battle of Singapore|defence of Singapore]] against the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese]], with the 18th Division, before British Commonwealth forces on that island surrendered on 15 February 1942 under the orders of Lieutenant-General [[Arthur Percival]].

In November 1941, with the threat of invasion reduced due to the oncoming winter, the battalion was converted to a regiment in the [[Royal Armoured Corps]], becoming [[142nd Regiment Royal Armoured Corps]] (142 RAC) and joined [[25th Army Tank Brigade]].

In this action the 2nd Battalion undertook a fierce rear-guard defence out-manned and out-gunned by superior numbers of enemy. The 2nd Battalion held their defensive position despite losing their commanding officer, Lt. Col. C.A.H. Brett DSO, at the commencement of the action and their second in command, Maj. E.C.

At length an overwhelming force rushed the 2nd Battalion from the rear, bringing down all resistance and the 2nd's defence of Le Cateau was at an end.

In late 1941 the 18th Division, the 4th and 5th Suffolks included, were originally to be sent to Egypt but instead were sent to Singapore to help strengthen the garrison there after Japan entered the war in December 1941. In early 1942, both the 4th and 5th battalions fought briefly in the [[Battle of Singapore|defence of Singapore]] against the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese]], with the 18th Division, before British Commonwealth forces on that island surrendered on 15 February 1942 under the orders of Lieutenant-General [[Arthur Percival]].

In November 1941, with the threat of invasion reduced due to the oncoming winter, the battalion was converted to a regiment in the [[Royal Armoured Corps]], becoming [[142nd Regiment Royal Armoured Corps]] (142 RAC) and joined [[25th Army Tank Brigade]].

As part of the [[British Invasion]], his [[hit record|hit]] song \"[[You Turn Me On (song)|You Turn Me On]]\" reached number 8 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1965.\n\nHe wrote several books on [[popular music]], beginning with ''[[After the Ball: Pop Music from Rag to Rock|After the Ball]]'', published by [[Penguin Books]] (Britain) and [[Simon & Schuster]] (United States) in 1972. He accompanied his singing by playing the [[ukulele]] and, through his [[gramophone record|records]], concerts, and film work, helped to stimulate the revival of interest in the instrument. His re-creation of the music played aboard the {{RMS|Titanic}} in [[Titanic (1997 film)|the film of that name]] won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1998 for package design and a nomination for Whitcomb's liner notes (''Titanic: Music as Heard on the Fateful Voyage'').\n\n==Early life==\nWhitcomb was born in [[Woking]], Surrey, England, and spent his childhood years in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[Thorpeness]] and [[Putney]].<ref name=auto>[https://www.picklehead.com/ian/bio.htm  Ian Whitcomb Biography, ''Picklehead.com'']. Retrieved 20 April 2020</ref>  His father, Pat, worked for his father's film company British Screen Classics in the 1920s, eventually co-starring in ''Mr. Nobody'' (released by Fox in 1929). His father was a trained pianist and encouraged Whitcomb to also play piano. Growing up, Whitcomb's chief musical inspirations were [[Phil Harris]], [[Johnnie Ray]], [[Guy Mitchell]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]]. He was sent away to boarding school in 1949 (Newlands, Seaford, [[Sussex]]) at age 8 and there he soon formed a [[tissue paper-and-comb]] band to entertain staff and boys with current hits such as \"[[(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend|Riders in the Sky]]\".\n\n==Music and writing career==\nAt [[Bryanston School|Bryanston]], a [[independent school (UK)|public school]] in Dorset, England, Whitcomb began writing comic and other songs.  He started a [[skiffle]] group in 1957 and then a [[rock and roll]] band in 1959. After leaving school, he worked at [[Harrods]], and then as an assistant at film studios.<ref name=auto/>  With his younger brother Robin on drums, he formed a band, The Ragtime Suwanee Six, that played at parties in the Surrey area and was managed by [[Denny Cordell]], later to produce records by [[Procol Harum]] and [[Joe Cocker]]. Robin went on to play [[tambourine]] on [[Sonny & Cher]]'s hit \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" (1965).\n\nAround 1963, while studying history at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], Ian Whitcomb became a founding member and lead vocalist of Dublin's early [[rhythm and blues]] band, Bluesville.  After some unreleased early recordings, Whitcomb travelled to [[Seattle]], where he performed and was signed to record for [[Jerden Records]].  After returning to Dublin, he recorded \"This Sporting Life\", written by [[Brownie McGhee]] and previously recorded as a skiffle number by [[Chas McDevitt]].  Whitcomb's recording was then licensed to the [[Tower Records (record label)|Tower]] label, a subsidiary of [[Capitol Records]], for release in the US.  It reached number 100 for one week on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]].<ref name=irishrock>[https://www.irishrock.org/irodb/bands/bluesville.html  Ian Whitcomb & Bluesville, ''IrishRock.org''].

He returned to Dublin for his history finals and received a BA [[academic degree|degree]]. In 1966 he turned to early popular song: his version of a 1916 [[Al Jolson]] comedy number, \"Where Did Robinson Crusoe Go with Friday on Saturday Night?\" was a West Coast hit, reviving the ukulele before the emergence of [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]].<ref name=Tranquada>{{cite book|last=Tranquada|first=Jim|title=The Ukulele \u2013 A History|year=2012|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-3634-4|pages=154\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAfter making four albums for the Tower label, Whitcomb retired as a pop performer, later writing that he \"wanted no part of the growing pretentiousness of rock with its mandatory drugs and wishy-washy spiritualism and its increasing loud and metallic guitar sounds.\"<ref name=auto/>  However, in 1969 he produced [[Mae West]] on her album called ''[[Great Balls Of Fire (Mae West album)|Great Balls of Fire]]'' for [[MGM Records]].  Whitcomb then returned to the UK, and was commissioned by [[Penguin Books]] to write a history of pop music.  This was ''[[After the Ball: Pop Music from Rag to Rock|After the Ball]]'', published  in 1972.   He appeared on several BBC TV show and was an early presenter of the BBC TV show ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'' in 1971.<ref name=auto/>\n\nWhitcomb settled in California in the late 1970s.  He starred in and wrote ''L.A.\u2013My Home Town'' (BBC TV; 1976) and ''Tin Pan Alley'' (PBS; 1974).  He wrote ''Tin Pan Alley, A Pictorial History'' (1919\u20131939) and a novel, ''Lotusland: A Story of Southern California'', published in 1979.   He also provided the music for a documentary film, ''Bugs Bunny: Superstar'' (UA), which was narrated by [[Orson Welles]]. For Play-Rite Music he cut 18 piano rolls that were included in an album, ''Pianomelt''. His other albums reflected his research into the genres of [[ragtime]], [[Tin Pan Alley]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]]. These, beginning with ''Under the Ragtime Moon''  (1972), were released on several [[record label]]s including [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[United Artists]], and [[Decca Records]]. During that time he also wrote and produced singles for Warner Bros.' country division, most notably \"Hands\", a [[massage parlour]] story, and \"A Friend of a Friend of Mine\".\n\nIn the 1980s Whitcomb published ''Rock Odyssey: A Chronicle of the Sixties: Ian Whitcomb'', a memoir of the 1960s and described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as the best personal account of this period. He also published ''Ragtime America'' (Limelight Editions, 1988), followed by a memoir of life as a British expatriate living in Los Angeles, ''Resident Alien'' (Century, 1990).   He wrote extensively on music, culture, and books for a diverse range of magazines including ''[[Radio Times]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'',  ''[[The London Magazine]]''.  He produced a British documentary on black music, ''Legends of Rhythm and Blues'' (part of the series ''Repercussions'', made by Third Eye Productions for [[Channel Four]] in 1984).<ref name=auto/> During this time he also hosted a [[radio show]] in Los Angeles for fifteen years, taking the program from [[KROQ-FM]] to [[KCRW]] and finally to [[KPCC-FM]].<ref>[http://www.laradio.com/wherew.htm Profile], Laradio.com; accessed 7 July 2015.</ref> \n\nHe continued to make recordings, producing a series of CD collections of old songs as ''Treasures of Tin Pan Alley'', and also curated albums of [[Al Jolson]] songs and the collection ''Titanic- Music As Heard On The Fateful\nVoyage''.  Whitcomb's liner notes were nominated for a [[Grammy]].  His songs are heard in the films ''Bloody Movie'' (1987), ''[[Cold Sassy Tree]]'' (1989), ''[[Encino Man]]'' (1992), ''[[Grass (1999 film)|Grass]]'' (1999), '' [[Man of the Century]]'' (1999), ''Stanley's Gig'' (2000), ''After the Storm'' (2001), ''[[The Cat's Meow]]'' (2002), ''[[Last Call (2002 film)|Last Call]]'' (2002), ''Sleep Easy, Hutch Rimes'' (2002), ''[[Lonesome Jim]]'' (2005), and ''[[Fido (film)|Fido]]'' (2006).\n\n==Later life==\nWhitcomb lived in [[Southern California]] with his wife, Regina, and their dog, Tobey.

19 April 2020) was an English entertainer, singer-songwriter, record producer, writer, broadcaster and actor. As part of the [[British Invasion]], his [[hit record|hit]] song \"[[You Turn Me On (song)|You Turn Me On]]\" reached number 8 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] in 1965.\n\nHe wrote several books on [[popular music]], beginning with ''[[After the Ball: Pop Music from Rag to Rock|After the Ball]]'', published by [[Penguin Books]] (Britain) and [[Simon & Schuster]] (United States) in 1972. He accompanied his singing by playing the [[ukulele]] and, through his [[gramophone record|records]], concerts, and film work, helped to stimulate the revival of interest in the instrument. His re-creation of the music played aboard the {{RMS|Titanic}} in [[Titanic (1997 film)|the film of that name]] won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1998 for package design and a nomination for Whitcomb's liner notes (''Titanic: Music as Heard on the Fateful Voyage'').\n\n==Early life==\nWhitcomb was born in [[Woking]], Surrey, England, and spent his childhood years in [[Scarborough]], [[Thorpeness]] and [[Putney]].<ref name=auto>[https://www.picklehead.com/ian/bio.htm  Ian Whitcomb Biography, ''Picklehead.com'']. Retrieved 20 April 2020</ref>  His father, Pat, worked for his father's film company British Screen Classics in the 1920s, eventually co-starring in ''Mr. Nobody'' (released by Fox in 1929). His father was a trained pianist and encouraged Whitcomb to also play piano. Growing up, Whitcomb's chief musical inspirations were [[Phil Harris]], [[Johnnie Ray]], [[Guy Mitchell]], [[Elvis Presley]], and [[George Formby, Jr.|George Formby]]. He was sent away to boarding school in 1949 (Newlands, Seaford, [[Sussex]]) at age 8 and there he soon formed a [[tissue paper-and-comb]] band to entertain staff and boys with current hits such as \"[[(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend|Riders in the Sky]]\".\n\n==Music and writing career==\nAt [[Bryanston School|Bryanston]], a [[independent school (UK)|public school]] in Dorset, England, Whitcomb began writing comic and other songs.  He started a [[skiffle]] group in 1957 and then a [[rock and roll]] band in 1959. After leaving school, he worked at [[Harrods]], and then as an assistant at film studios.<ref name=auto/>  With his younger brother Robin on drums, he formed a band, The Ragtime Suwanee Six, that played at parties in the Surrey area and was managed by [[Denny Cordell]], later to produce records by [[Procol Harum]] and [[Joe Cocker]]. Robin went on to play [[tambourine]] on [[Sonny & Cher]]'s hit \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" (1965).\n\nAround 1963, while studying history at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], Ian Whitcomb became a founding member and lead vocalist of Dublin's early [[rhythm and blues]] band, Bluesville.  After some unreleased early recordings, Whitcomb travelled to [[Seattle]], where he performed and was signed to record for [[Jerden Records]].  After returning to Dublin, he recorded \"This Sporting Life\", written by [[Brownie McGhee]] and previously recorded as a skiffle number by [[Chas McDevitt]].  Whitcomb's recording was then licensed to the [[Tower Records (record label)|Tower]] label, a subsidiary of [[Capitol Records]], for release in the US.  It reached number 100 for one week on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]].<ref name=irishrock>[https://www.irishrock.org/irodb/bands/bluesville.html  Ian Whitcomb & Bluesville, ''IrishRock.org''].

Whitcomb played the [[Hollywood Bowl]] with [[The Beach Boys]] in 1965 and then toured with [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Kinks]], and [[Sam the Sham]] and the Pharaohs.<ref name=auto/>\n\n\"N-E-R-V-O-U-S!\", Whitcomb's next release, was recorded in Hollywood and reached No. 59 in Billboard and No. 47 in Cash Box. He returned to Dublin for his history finals and received a BA [[academic degree|degree]]. In 1966 he turned to early popular song: his version of a 1916 [[Al Jolson]] comedy number, \"Where Did Robinson Crusoe Go with Friday on Saturday Night?\" was a West Coast hit, reviving the ukulele before the emergence of [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]].<ref name=Tranquada>{{cite book|last=Tranquada|first=Jim|title=The Ukulele \u2013 A History|year=2012|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|isbn=978-0-8248-3634-4|pages=154\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAfter making four albums for the Tower label, Whitcomb retired as a pop performer, later writing that he \"wanted no part of the growing pretentiousness of rock with its mandatory drugs and wishy-washy spiritualism and its increasing loud and metallic guitar sounds.\"<ref name=auto/>  However, in 1969 he produced [[Mae West]] on her album called ''[[Great Balls Of Fire (Mae West album)|Great Balls of Fire]]'' for [[MGM Records]].  Whitcomb then returned to the UK, and was commissioned by [[Penguin Books]] to write a history of pop music.  This was ''[[After the Ball: Pop Music from Rag to Rock|After the Ball]]'', published  in 1972.   He appeared on several BBC TV show and was an early presenter of the BBC TV show ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'' in 1971.<ref name=auto/>\n\nWhitcomb settled in California in the late 1970s.  He starred in and wrote ''L.A.\u2013My Home Town'' (BBC TV; 1976) and ''Tin Pan Alley'' (PBS; 1974).  He wrote ''Tin Pan Alley, A Pictorial History'' (1919\u20131939) and a novel, ''Lotusland: A Story of Southern California'', published in 1979.   He also provided the music for a documentary film, ''Bugs Bunny: Superstar'' (UA), which was narrated by [[Orson Welles]]. For Play-Rite Music he cut 18 piano rolls that were included in an album, ''Pianomelt''. His other albums reflected his research into the genres of [[ragtime]], [[Tin Pan Alley]], [[vaudeville]], and [[music hall]]. These, beginning with ''Under the Ragtime Moon''  (1972), were released on several [[record label]]s including [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[United Artists]], and [[Decca Records]]. During that time he also wrote and produced singles for Warner Bros.' country division, most notably \"Hands\", a [[massage parlour]] story, and \"A Friend of a Friend of Mine\".\n\nIn the 1980s Whitcomb published ''Rock Odyssey: A Chronicle of the Sixties: Ian Whitcomb'', a memoir of the 1960s and described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as the best personal account of this period. He also published ''Ragtime America'' (Limelight Editions, 1988), followed by a memoir of life as a British expatriate living in Los Angeles, ''Resident Alien'' (Century, 1990).   He wrote extensively on music, culture, and books for a diverse range of magazines including ''[[Radio Times]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'',  ''[[The London Magazine]]''.  He produced a British documentary on black music, ''Legends of Rhythm and Blues'' (part of the series ''Repercussions'', made by Third Eye Productions for [[Channel Four]] in 1984).<ref name=auto/> During this time he also hosted a [[radio show]] in Los Angeles for fifteen years, taking the program from [[KROQ-FM]] to [[KCRW]] and finally to [[KPCC-FM]].<ref>[http://www.laradio.com/wherew.htm Profile], Laradio.com; accessed 7 July 2015.</ref> \n\nHe continued to make recordings, producing a series of CD collections of old songs as ''Treasures of Tin Pan Alley'', and also curated albums of [[Al Jolson]] songs and the collection ''Titanic- Music As Heard On The Fateful\nVoyage''.  Whitcomb's liner notes were nominated for a [[Grammy]].
