It supports 11 to 30-year-olds who are unemployed and those struggling at school and at risk of exclusion. Many of the young people helped by The Trust are in or leaving care, facing issues such as homelessness or mental health problems, or have been in trouble with the law.\n\nIt runs a range of training programmes, providing practical and financial support to build young people's confidence and motivation. Each year they work with about 60,000 young people; with three in four moving on to employment, education, volunteering or training.\n\nIn 1999, the numerous Trust charities were brought together as The Prince's Trust and was acknowledged by [[Queen Elizabeth II|The Queen]] at a ceremony in [[Buckingham Palace]] where she granted it a [[Royal Charter]].

The process begins each summer when staff, volunteers, partners and supporters nominate the exceptional young people they\u2019ve met. In each of the regions and countries, judging panels select finalists in seven award categories.\n\nThroughout the autumn The Trust holds 11 Oscar-style regional award ceremonies across the country before hosting a national final in London where the red carpet is rolled out.\n\nHosted by [[Ant and Dec]] and attended by a range of celebrity ambassadors, including Thierry Henry, Gemma Arterton and Emilia Fox, it recognises the Young Achiever of the Year, Young Ambassador of the Year and many more.\n\n==Generating income==\nThe Prince's Trust obtains money from two main sources. Firstly, there is the income received as a result of the charitable activities it undertakes, and secondly it raises voluntary income. 87p in every \u00a31 donated to The Prince's Trust is spent on charitable activities. \n\n===Income from charitable activities===\nThis totalled nearly \u00a316&nbsp;million in 2007/8 and was mostly contract payments for courses, training, mentoring and other services. Of the \u00a316&nbsp;million, nearly \u00a32&nbsp;million came from local and national government, over \u00a39&nbsp;million from other public sector sources, nearly \u00a34&nbsp;million from the European Union and \u00a3753,000 from the Community Fund.\n\nThe \"other\" public sector sources included:\n\nRegional Dev.

Previously much of the EU money for the Prince's Trust came from the European Social Fund (ESF) and could only be spent to help young people who are Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esf.gov.uk/ |accessdate=15 April 2008|title=European Social Fund in England 2007\u20132013}}</ref> Some of the ESF money went directly to the Prince's Trust (\u00a3816,000 2006/7), but mostly it went to the [[Learning and Skills Council]] (LSC) who \"doubled it up\" with government money that then had the same restrictions placed on it. Some LSC money was given directly to the Prince's Trust (\u00a31.3&nbsp;million 2006/7) but the majority went to the regional LSC offices who took out contracts with the regional Prince's Trust offices to provide services for unemployed young people. The ESF money was channelled through so many routes it is difficult to determine how much it amounted to, but in 2006 the funding provided by the LSC to the Prince's Trust in total came to approximately \u00a311&nbsp;million, although clearly these figures have decreased somewhat in recent years.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=15 April 2008|title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers 11 Jan 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Voluntary income===\nThe voluntary income raised in 2007-8 was more than \u00a320&nbsp;million, consisting of \u00a35.2&nbsp;million from [[charitable trust]]s, \u00a34.7&nbsp;million in corporate donations, \u00a34.5 in individual donations and \u00a32.1&nbsp;million donations in kind.\n\n====Individual donations====\nLeadership Groups are an important part of the trust's fundraising from individuals. These groups are made up of successful (i.e. rich) individuals within certain business sectors, such as the Technology and Construction sectors. The aim with these groups is that the individuals not only give donations, but also that they encourage employee donations and volunteering from within their organisations.\n\n====Fundraising events====\nThe trust still has some fundraising events, including a Rock Gala that aired on 25 December 2010 on [[DirecTV]].

It supports 11 to 30-year-olds who are unemployed and those struggling at school and at risk of exclusion. Many of the young people helped by The Trust are in or leaving care, facing issues such as homelessness or mental health problems, or have been in trouble with the law.\n\nIt runs a range of training programmes, providing practical and financial support to build young people's confidence and motivation. Each year they work with about 60,000 young people; with three in four moving on to employment, education, volunteering or training.\n\nIn 1999, the numerous Trust charities were brought together as The Prince's Trust and was acknowledged by [[Queen Elizabeth II|The Queen]] at a ceremony in [[Buckingham Palace]] where she granted it a [[Royal Charter]]. The following year it devolved in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and other English regions but overall control remained in London. The Prince's Trust fundraising and campaign events are often hosted and feature entertainers from around the world.

Agencies (One North East) \u00a3775,000\nEast Midlands Development Agency \u00a3730,000\nThe Big Lottery Fund \u00a3660,000\nDepartment for Education & Skills \u00a3158,000\n\nIt is unclear how much money in total came from the European Union (EU), as although some money (\u00a34 million) is declared as coming directly, other money can be channelled indirectly through other organisations. Previously much of the EU money for the Prince's Trust came from the European Social Fund (ESF) and could only be spent to help young people who are Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esf.gov.uk/ |accessdate=15 April 2008|title=European Social Fund in England 2007\u20132013}}</ref> Some of the ESF money went directly to the Prince's Trust (\u00a3816,000 2006/7), but mostly it went to the [[Learning and Skills Council]] (LSC) who \"doubled it up\" with government money that then had the same restrictions placed on it. Some LSC money was given directly to the Prince's Trust (\u00a31.3&nbsp;million 2006/7) but the majority went to the regional LSC offices who took out contracts with the regional Prince's Trust offices to provide services for unemployed young people. The ESF money was channelled through so many routes it is difficult to determine how much it amounted to, but in 2006 the funding provided by the LSC to the Prince's Trust in total came to approximately \u00a311&nbsp;million, although clearly these figures have decreased somewhat in recent years.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=15 April 2008|title=House of Commons Hansard Written Answers 11 Jan 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Voluntary income===\nThe voluntary income raised in 2007-8 was more than \u00a320&nbsp;million, consisting of \u00a35.2&nbsp;million from [[charitable trust]]s, \u00a34.7&nbsp;million in corporate donations, \u00a34.5 in individual donations and \u00a32.1&nbsp;million donations in kind.\n\n====Individual donations====\nLeadership Groups are an important part of the trust's fundraising from individuals. These groups are made up of successful (i.e. rich) individuals within certain business sectors, such as the Technology and Construction sectors. The aim with these groups is that the individuals not only give donations, but also that they encourage employee donations and volunteering from within their organisations.\n\n====Fundraising events====\nThe trust still has some fundraising events, including a Rock Gala that aired on 25 December 2010 on [[DirecTV]]. In 2012, the Prince's Trust was one of the main beneficiaries of [[Bob Finch]] and Michael Holland's Oil Aid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oilaid.org/|title=Welcome to Oil Aid 2012}}</ref>\n\n==The Prince's Trust Group==\nThe [https://www.princes-trust.org.uk/about-the-trust/princes-trust-group Prince\u2019s Trust Group]\u2019s mission is to transform lives and build sustainable communities across the world.

However, many users report that the three families have subjectively different qualities in the \"feel\" of the experience, which are difficult to describe. At lower doses, these include sensory alterations, such as the warping of surfaces, shape suggestibility, and color variations.

Though it must not be understood that his talent is merely descriptive. There is a philosophic and also a romantic strain in it..... There is scarcely a poem of Mr. Scott's from which one could not cull some memorable descriptive passage.... As a rule Mr. Scott's workmanship is careful and highly finished. He is before everything a colourist. He paints in lines of a peculiar and vivid translucency. But he is also a metrist of no mean skill, and an imaginative thinker of no common capacity.<ref name=garvin/>}}\n\nThe Government of Canada biography of him says that: <blockquote>Although the quality of Scott's work is uneven, he is at his best when describing the Canadian wilderness and Indigenous peoples. Although they constitute a small portion of his total output, Scott's widely recognized and valued 'Indian poems' cemented his literary reputation. In these poems, the reader senses the conflict that Scott felt between his role as an administrator committed to an assimilation policy for Canada's Native peoples and his feelings as a poet, saddened by the encroachment of European civilization on the Indian way of life.<ref name=\"cpascott\"/></blockquote>\n\n\"There is not a really bad poem in the book,\" [[literary critic]] Desmond Pacey said of Scott's first book,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Tracy |last=Ware |title=William Cyril Desmond Pacey |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada |edition=online |date=April 10, 2008 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/william-cyril-desmond-pacey/ |access-date=September 22, 2015}}</ref> ''The Magic House and Other Poems'', \"and there are a number of extremely good ones.\" The 'extremely good ones' include the strange, dream-like sonnets of \"In the House of Dreams.\" \"Probably the best known poem from the collection is 'At the Cedars,' a grim narrative about the death of a young man and his sweetheart during a log-jam on the Ottawa River.

The lengthy title poem makes dreary reading.... Of greater interest is his growing willingness to experiment with stanza form, variations in line length, use of partial rhyme, and lack of rhyme.\" Notable new poems included \"The Cup\" and the sonnet \"The Onandaga Madonna.\" But arguably \"the most memorable poem in the new collection\" was the fantasy, \"The Piper of Arll.\" One person who long remembered that poem was future British [[Poet Laureate]] [[John Masefield]], who read \"The Piper of Arll\" as a teenager and years later wrote to Scott:{{quote|I had never (till that time) cared very much for poetry, but your poem impressed me deeply, and set me on fire.

Aside from his poetry, Scott made his mark in Canadian history as the head of the [[Department of Indian Affairs]] from 1913 to 1932.\n \nEven before Confederation, the Canadian government had adopted a policy of assimilation under the [[Gradual Civilization Act|Gradual Civilization Act 1857]]. One biographer of Scott states that:{{quote|The Canadian government\u2019s Indian policy had already been set before Scott was in a position to influence it, but he never saw any reason to question its assumption that the 'red' man ought to become just like the 'white' man. Shortly after he became Deputy Superintendent, he wrote approvingly: 'The happiest future for the Indian race is absorption into the general population, and this is the object and policy of our government.'... Assimilation, so the reasoning went, would solve the 'Indian problem,' and wrenching children away from their parents to 'civilize' them in residential schools until they were eighteen was believed to be a sure way of achieving the government\u2019s goal. Scott ... would later pat himself on the back: 'I was never unsympathetic to aboriginal ideals, but there was the law which I did not originate and which I never tried to amend in the direction of severity.'<ref name=adams/>}}\nwhile Scott himself wrote: {{quote|I want to get rid of the Indian problem. I do not think as a matter of fact, that the country ought to continuously protect a class of people who are able to stand alone\u2026 Our objective is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic and there is no Indian question, and no Indian Department, that is the whole object of this Bill.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Indian Problem |website=Primary Source:Residential Schools |location=National Archives of Canada, Record Group 10, vol 6810, file 470-2-3, vol 7, pp. 55 (L-3) and 63 (N-3) |url=http://tc2.ca/sourcedocs/uploads/images/HD%20Sources%20(text%20thumbs)/Aboriginal%20History/Residential%20Schools/Residential-Schools%2010.pdf |access-date=September 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite report |title=The Historical Development of the Indian Act |edition=second |location=Ottawa |publisher=Treaties and Historical Research Centre, P.R.E.

Attendance at a residential school was made compulsory. Although a reading of Bill 14 states that no particular kind of school was stipulated. Scott was in favour of residential schooling for aboriginal children, as he believed removing them from the influences of home and reserve would hasten the cultural and economic transformation of the whole aboriginal population. In cases where a residential school was the only kind available, residential enrollment did become mandatory, and aboriginal children were compelled to leave their homes, their families and their culture, with or without their parents' consent. However, in 1901, 226 of the 290 Indian schools across Canada were day schools, and by 1961, the 377 day schools far outnumbered the 56 residential institutions.<ref>Dominion Bureau of Statistics, 1963</ref>\n\n[[File:Duncan Campbell Scott DEC 1921 Letter.jpg|thumb|Letter from Duncan Campbell Scott of Canada Department Of Indian Affairs To Staff]] In December 1921 Scott authored a letter to agents under his supervision that clearly condescends and derides Indian people and activities in such a way that fully outlayed Scott's authoritative approach and negative opinion on indigenous customs, social activities and hygiene. \"It is observed with alarm that the holding of dances by the Indians on their reserves is on the increase, and that these practices tend to disorganize the efforts which the Department is putting forth to make them self-supporting,\" Scott wrote. \"I have, therefore, to direct you to use your utmost endeavours to dissuade the Indians from excessive indulgence in the practice of dancing. You should suppress any dances which cause waste of time, interfere with the occupations of the Indians, unsettle them for serious work, injure their health or encourage them in sloth and idleness.\" He goes on to add agents should use tact to \"obtain control and keep it\" and prevent Indians from attending \"fairs, exhibitions etc\". \"It is realized that reasonable amusement and recreation should be enjoyed by Indians, but they should not be allowed to dissipate their energies and abandon themselves to demoralizing amusements.\" <ref>{{cite web |title=Racism writ large: a 1921 letter from Duncan Campbell Scott |date= December 15, 1921 |url=https://www.straight.com/news/927721/racism-writ-large-1921-letter-duncan-campbell-scott |access-date=June 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Duncan Campbell Scott.jpg|thumb|left|Duncan Campbell Scott]]\nCBC has reported that \"In all, about 150,000 aboriginal, Inuit and M\u00e9tis children were removed from their communities and forced to attend the schools.\"<ref name=cbc>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2008/05/16/f-faqs-residential-schools.html |title=A history of residential schools in Canada |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=January 7, 2014 |access-date=September 23, 2015}}</ref> The 150,000 enrollment figure is an estimate not disputed by Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, but it is not clear what percentage were \"removed from their communities and forced to attend the schools.\" A percentage of the residential schools were in or close by the children's communities. Moreover, while many aboriginal parents distrusted the residential schools or preferred to raise and educate their children in a traditional manner, other parents willingly enrolled their children, partly from a belief that the schooling of the \"white man\" would benefit them, and partly from a knowledge that schools would provide shelter, food and clothing which dire conditions on the reserve could not provide. Harsh criticism has been leveled at Scott and the residential school system, as children who attended some of the more poorly maintained or administered schools lived in terrible conditions; in some cases the mortality rate exceeded fifty percent due to the spread of infectious disease.<ref>{{cite news |first=DeNeen L. |last=Brown |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/11/AR2008061100419.html |title=Canadian Government Apologizes For Abuse of Indigenous People |work=Washington Post |date=June 12, 2008 |access-date=September 23, 2015}}</ref>  Furthermore, Scott continued with his advocacy knowing that death from illness (such as influenza and tuberculosis) and suicide was common. This situation was made worse by the federal policy that tied funding to enrollment numbers, which resulted in some schools enrolling sick children in order to boost their numbers. Echoing Scott's desire to absorb aboriginals into the wider Canadian population, many residential and day schools strongly discouraged students from speaking their native language, and harsh punishments were administered.<ref name=cbc/> Corporal punishment was sometimes justified by the belief that it was the only way to \"save souls\", \"civilize\" the native children and, in the residential schools, punish runaways who might make the school responsible for injury or death while trying to return home. Many reports of physical, sexual and psychological abuse in the residential schools have surfaced over the years.<ref>{{cite news |author=Akile Ch\u2019oh |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=7e574538-75e8-4e6e-9337-fae5c797599f |title=From apology to action: A response to the Residential Schools Apology |work=Vancouver Sun |access-date=September 23, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924142612/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=7e574538-75e8-4e6e-9337-fae5c797599f |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Exact numbers are unknown, as the government at the time did not see fit to keep track of such things. Because any kind of scandal coming out of the residential schools would have caused Indian Affairs, the churches and the government of the day much embarrassment, incidents of abuse were often discounted or covered up. However, based on survivor's accounts, as many as 75% of the children in particularly awful schools may have been sexually assaulted. He clearly condoned the policy of removing the children's cultural identity, praising practices such as referring to students only by a number and beating them when they dared to speak their own language.\n\nWhen Scott retired, his \"policy of assimilating the Indians had been so much in keeping with the thinking of the time that he was widely praised for his capable administration.\"<ref name=adams/> At the time, Scott was able to point to evidence of success in increasing enrollment and attendance, as the number of First Nations children enrolled in any school rose from 11,303 in 1912 to 17,163 in 1932. Residential school enrollment during the same period rose from 3,904 to 8,213. Actual attendance figures from all schools had also risen sharply, going from 64% of enrollment in 1920 to 75% in 1930, and Scott attributed this rise partly to Bill 14's section on compulsory attendance but also to a more positive attitude among First Nations people toward education.<ref>{{cite book |last=Titley |first=E.

In these poems, the reader senses the conflict that Scott felt between his role as an administrator committed to an assimilation policy for Canada's Native peoples and his feelings as a poet, saddened by the encroachment of European civilization on the Indian way of life.<ref name=\"cpascott\"/></blockquote>\n\n\"There is not a really bad poem in the book,\" [[literary critic]] Desmond Pacey said of Scott's first book,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Tracy |last=Ware |title=William Cyril Desmond Pacey |work=The Canadian Encyclopedia |publisher=Historica Canada |edition=online |date=April 10, 2008 |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/william-cyril-desmond-pacey/ |access-date=September 22, 2015}}</ref> ''The Magic House and Other Poems'', \"and there are a number of extremely good ones.\" The 'extremely good ones' include the strange, dream-like sonnets of \"In the House of Dreams.\" \"Probably the best known poem from the collection is 'At the Cedars,' a grim narrative about the death of a young man and his sweetheart during a log-jam on the Ottawa River.

Aside from his poetry, Scott made his mark in Canadian history as the head of the [[Department of Indian Affairs]] from 1913 to 1932.\n \nEven before Confederation, the Canadian government had adopted a policy of assimilation under the [[Gradual Civilization Act|Gradual Civilization Act 1857]]. One biographer of Scott states that:{{quote|The Canadian government\u2019s Indian policy had already been set before Scott was in a position to influence it, but he never saw any reason to question its assumption that the 'red' man ought to become just like the 'white' man. Shortly after he became Deputy Superintendent, he wrote approvingly: 'The happiest future for the Indian race is absorption into the general population, and this is the object and policy of our government.'... Assimilation, so the reasoning went, would solve the 'Indian problem,' and wrenching children away from their parents to 'civilize' them in residential schools until they were eighteen was believed to be a sure way of achieving the government\u2019s goal. Scott ... would later pat himself on the back: 'I was never unsympathetic to aboriginal ideals, but there was the law which I did not originate and which I never tried to amend in the direction of severity.'<ref name=adams/>}}\nwhile Scott himself wrote: {{quote|I want to get rid of the Indian problem. I do not think as a matter of fact, that the country ought to continuously protect a class of people who are able to stand alone\u2026 Our objective is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic and there is no Indian question, and no Indian Department, that is the whole object of this Bill.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Indian Problem |website=Primary Source:Residential Schools |location=National Archives of Canada, Record Group 10, vol 6810, file 470-2-3, vol 7, pp. 55 (L-3) and 63 (N-3) |url=http://tc2.ca/sourcedocs/uploads/images/HD%20Sources%20(text%20thumbs)/Aboriginal%20History/Residential%20Schools/Residential-Schools%2010.pdf |access-date=September 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite report |title=The Historical Development of the Indian Act |edition=second |location=Ottawa |publisher=Treaties and Historical Research Centre, P.R.E.

Attendance at a residential school was made compulsory. Although a reading of Bill 14 states that no particular kind of school was stipulated. Scott was in favour of residential schooling for aboriginal children, as he believed removing them from the influences of home and reserve would hasten the cultural and economic transformation of the whole aboriginal population. In cases where a residential school was the only kind available, residential enrollment did become mandatory, and aboriginal children were compelled to leave their homes, their families and their culture, with or without their parents' consent. However, in 1901, 226 of the 290 Indian schools across Canada were day schools, and by 1961, the 377 day schools far outnumbered the 56 residential institutions.<ref>Dominion Bureau of Statistics, 1963</ref>\n\n[[File:Duncan Campbell Scott DEC 1921 Letter.jpg|thumb|Letter from Duncan Campbell Scott of Canada Department Of Indian Affairs To Staff]] In December 1921 Scott authored a letter to agents under his supervision that clearly condescends and derides Indian people and activities in such a way that fully outlayed Scott's authoritative approach and negative opinion on indigenous customs, social activities and hygiene. \"It is observed with alarm that the holding of dances by the Indians on their reserves is on the increase, and that these practices tend to disorganize the efforts which the Department is putting forth to make them self-supporting,\" Scott wrote. \"I have, therefore, to direct you to use your utmost endeavours to dissuade the Indians from excessive indulgence in the practice of dancing. You should suppress any dances which cause waste of time, interfere with the occupations of the Indians, unsettle them for serious work, injure their health or encourage them in sloth and idleness.\" He goes on to add agents should use tact to \"obtain control and keep it\" and prevent Indians from attending \"fairs, exhibitions etc\". \"It is realized that reasonable amusement and recreation should be enjoyed by Indians, but they should not be allowed to dissipate their energies and abandon themselves to demoralizing amusements.\" <ref>{{cite web |title=Racism writ large: a 1921 letter from Duncan Campbell Scott |date= December 15, 1921 |url=https://www.straight.com/news/927721/racism-writ-large-1921-letter-duncan-campbell-scott |access-date=June 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Duncan Campbell Scott.jpg|thumb|left|Duncan Campbell Scott]]\nCBC has reported that \"In all, about 150,000 aboriginal, Inuit and M\u00e9tis children were removed from their communities and forced to attend the schools.\"<ref name=cbc>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2008/05/16/f-faqs-residential-schools.html |title=A history of residential schools in Canada |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=January 7, 2014 |access-date=September 23, 2015}}</ref> The 150,000 enrollment figure is an estimate not disputed by Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, but it is not clear what percentage were \"removed from their communities and forced to attend the schools.\" A percentage of the residential schools were in or close by the children's communities. Moreover, while many aboriginal parents distrusted the residential schools or preferred to raise and educate their children in a traditional manner, other parents willingly enrolled their children, partly from a belief that the schooling of the \"white man\" would benefit them, and partly from a knowledge that schools would provide shelter, food and clothing which dire conditions on the reserve could not provide. Harsh criticism has been leveled at Scott and the residential school system, as children who attended some of the more poorly maintained or administered schools lived in terrible conditions; in some cases the mortality rate exceeded fifty percent due to the spread of infectious disease.<ref>{{cite news |first=DeNeen L. |last=Brown |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/11/AR2008061100419.html |title=Canadian Government Apologizes For Abuse of Indigenous People |work=Washington Post |date=June 12, 2008 |access-date=September 23, 2015}}</ref>  Furthermore, Scott continued with his advocacy knowing that death from illness (such as influenza and tuberculosis) and suicide was common. This situation was made worse by the federal policy that tied funding to enrollment numbers, which resulted in some schools enrolling sick children in order to boost their numbers. Echoing Scott's desire to absorb aboriginals into the wider Canadian population, many residential and day schools strongly discouraged students from speaking their native language, and harsh punishments were administered.<ref name=cbc/> Corporal punishment was sometimes justified by the belief that it was the only way to \"save souls\", \"civilize\" the native children and, in the residential schools, punish runaways who might make the school responsible for injury or death while trying to return home. Many reports of physical, sexual and psychological abuse in the residential schools have surfaced over the years.<ref>{{cite news |author=Akile Ch\u2019oh |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=7e574538-75e8-4e6e-9337-fae5c797599f |title=From apology to action: A response to the Residential Schools Apology |work=Vancouver Sun |access-date=September 23, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924142612/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=7e574538-75e8-4e6e-9337-fae5c797599f |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Exact numbers are unknown, as the government at the time did not see fit to keep track of such things. Because any kind of scandal coming out of the residential schools would have caused Indian Affairs, the churches and the government of the day much embarrassment, incidents of abuse were often discounted or covered up. However, based on survivor's accounts, as many as 75% of the children in particularly awful schools may have been sexually assaulted. He clearly condoned the policy of removing the children's cultural identity, praising practices such as referring to students only by a number and beating them when they dared to speak their own language.\n\nWhen Scott retired, his \"policy of assimilating the Indians had been so much in keeping with the thinking of the time that he was widely praised for his capable administration.\"<ref name=adams/> At the time, Scott was able to point to evidence of success in increasing enrollment and attendance, as the number of First Nations children enrolled in any school rose from 11,303 in 1912 to 17,163 in 1932. Residential school enrollment during the same period rose from 3,904 to 8,213. Actual attendance figures from all schools had also risen sharply, going from 64% of enrollment in 1920 to 75% in 1930, and Scott attributed this rise partly to Bill 14's section on compulsory attendance but also to a more positive attitude among First Nations people toward education.<ref>{{cite book |last=Titley |first=E.

Moreover, over the long history of the residential system, only a minority of all enrolled students went beyond the elementary grades, and many former students found themselves lacking the skills that would enable them to find employment on or off the reserve.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn 2015, the plaque beside his grave at Ottawa's Beechwood cemetery was revised to read \n{{quote|As Deputy Superintendent, Scott oversaw the assimilationist Indian Residential School system for Aboriginal children, stating his goal was 'to get rid of the Indian problem'\" ... \"In its 2015 report, Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission said that the Indian Residential School system amounted to cultural genocide.<ref>http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/duncan-campbell-scott-plaque-updated-1.3299062</ref>}}\n\n===Reputation as an assimilationist===\n\nIn 2003, Scott's Indian Affairs legacy came under attack from Neu and Therrien:{{quote|[Scott] took a romantic interest in Native traditions, he was after all a poet of some repute (a member of the Royal Society of Canada), as well as being an accountant and a bureaucrat.

Bomman spends most of his time with Manickam and earns his livelihood by hiring it out for festivals in temples and wedding celebrations. Meanwhile, in a village dominated by old principles, a rogue elephant (Komban) ravages crops and ambushes its people. Frustrated by this and without any help from the forest officers, their leader decides to bring a kumki elephant to tame Komban. Bomman and his crew reach the village as placeholders to stay for a couple of days until the real mahout and kumki elephant arrive. Life begins to change for Bomman when he falls in love with Alli ([[Lakshmi Menon (actress)|Lakshmi Menon]]), the daughter of the village leader. She is at first reluctant keeping in mind the village's principles but she soon starts to fall for Bomman. Life goes on smoothly, until Komban starts attacking the village. Komban kills Kothali and Undiyal and injures Bomman. In the ensuing fight between Manickam and Komban, Manickam kills Komban but suffers serious injuries and dies. Bomman then cries out loud, regretting that his love had led to the death of his crew and Manickam. Alli's father then recognizes that Alli and Bomman are in love. The film then ends abruptly, leaving Bomman's fate to the viewer's imagination.\n\n==Cast==\n{{quote box\n| quote = My son surprised me by his performance in ''Kumki''.

Bomman spends most of his time with Manickam and earns his livelihood by hiring it out for festivals in temples and wedding celebrations. Meanwhile, in a village dominated by old principles, a rogue elephant (Komban) ravages crops and ambushes its people. Frustrated by this and without any help from the forest officers, their leader decides to bring a kumki elephant to tame Komban. Bomman and his crew reach the village as placeholders to stay for a couple of days until the real mahout and kumki elephant arrive. Life begins to change for Bomman when he falls in love with Alli ([[Lakshmi Menon (actress)|Lakshmi Menon]]), the daughter of the village leader. She is at first reluctant keeping in mind the village's principles but she soon starts to fall for Bomman. Life goes on smoothly, until Komban starts attacking the village. Komban kills Kothali and Undiyal and injures Bomman. In the ensuing fight between Manickam and Komban, Manickam kills Komban but suffers serious injuries and dies. Bomman then cries out loud, regretting that his love had led to the death of his crew and Manickam. Alli's father then recognizes that Alli and Bomman are in love. The film then ends abruptly, leaving Bomman's fate to the viewer's imagination.\n\n==Cast==\n{{quote box\n| quote = My son surprised me by his performance in ''Kumki''.

Kuehn was raised on the South side of [[Chicago, Illinois]]. He attended the [[University of Miami]], produced a local radio show and worked as a floor manager for a local sports television show. In 1961, Kuehn started working with [[National Screen Service]], which was the predominate, if not singular, provider of motion picture trailers to Hollywood. At the time, their trailers typically featured a great deal of copy, slowly paced editing, bold graphic treatment of titles and cast information, and a presentational style borrowed from circus pitchmen and carnival barkers.<ref>[http://www.ajkfoundation.org Ajkfoundation.org]</ref>\n\n==Move to Hollywood==\nTapped by [[MGM]] to come to Hollywood, he contributed to the success of such important films such as ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'', and ''[[Blowup]]'',\" and in 1964, Andrew J. Kuehn distributed his independently produced trailer for ''[[The Night of the Iguana (film)|Night of the Iguana]]'', using stark, high-contrast photography, fast-paced editing and a provocative narration by a young [[James Earl Jones]]. His format was so successful, he began producing this new form of trailer with partner Dan Davis.\n\nKuehn opened the West Coast office of Kaleidoscope Films in 1968 and Kuehn and his company became a major player in the trailer industry for the next three decades. As Hollywood began to produce bigger blockbuster films and invest more money in marketing them, directors like [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Oliver Stone]] and [[Barbra Streisand]] began to depend on Kuehn and Kaleidoscope for their ability to create the best trailers theater-goers could see. Kuehn alumni include leading trailer makers and marketing creatives.\n\nMr. Kuehn developed trailers for films including the original ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', the ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' trilogy, ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', ''[[Schindler's List]]'', ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', ''[[The Sting]]'',  ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Top Gun]]'', ''[[Back to the Future]]'', ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', and ''[[Witness]].''<ref name=NYT/>\n\n\"A trailer is two or three minutes long - about the length of a song - and I think of trailers as songs,\" said Kuehn, who was noted for his clever writing, use of music and sharp editing. \"One of the hardest things to do when looking at a movie is to determine the overall tone, tempo, mood, pacing and rhythm of the trailer. They may not be the same as the tone and rhythms of the picture itself.\"<ref name=TI>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/andrew-j-kuehn-549394.html The Independent]</ref>\n\nIn a trade interview, Kuehn said, \"A trailer has but one goal: to draw audiences out of their houses and into a theater. To do that you have to set up a sense of urgency. In the process of arriving at that forced pace, we advanced the style of editing. We really pushed the envelope in terms of what audiences would accept.\"<ref name=V/>\n\n\"Andy was a kaleidoscope, never repetitious, always visually original, and above all, he was a lovely man: fun to be with, fun to work with. Andy understood the rhythms of editing and the important role music plays in telling a story. He never relied on the same creative idea twice. I also treasured that there were so many other dimensions to him as a person that enriched our time together.

Andy did it by building relationship with filmmakers, he did it by setting high standards of creativity, and he did it because he had good taste.

Michael Camp headed the trailer department at [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Tom Kennedy (producer)|Tom Kennedy]] at [[MGM]], Jeff Werner and Vince Arcaro all started their own successful trailer companies and Bob Harper began his career as a messenger at Kaleidoscope before becoming a producer and quickly Vice-Chairman of [[20th Century Fox|Fox Filmed Entertainment]] and, in 2007, Chairman of Regency Entertainment.

His passion for his art, his passion for his country, and for life in general, will be very sorely missed.\" - [[Barbra Streisand]]<ref>[http://www.ajkfoundation.org/ajkbio12.asp Ajkfoundation.org]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n\"...Over the years, they worked on so many of the films that I directed or produced, and I remember not just with ET or Schindler\u00b4s list, but also the times when the campaigns may have even been better than some the films I produced, and that\u00b4s as much a salute to Andy\u00b4s talent as his long list of tremendously successful pictures. Andy did it by building relationship with filmmakers, he did it by setting high standards of creativity, and he did it because he had good taste.
