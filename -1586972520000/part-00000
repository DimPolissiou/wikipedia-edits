Her real name is '''Mysa Nal''', although her name was given as '''Xola Aq''' in [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Legion stories in ''[[Adventure Comics]]''; the revelation that her name was actually Mysa Nal was a later [[retcon]]. She is the sister of fellow Legionnaire [[Nura Nal|Dream Girl]] and daughter of former High Seer of [[Naltor]] Kiwa Nal. Like Dream Girl, she is a native of the planet Naltor, where nearly everyone has the power of [[precognition]]; however, unlike most Naltorians, Mysa cannot foresee the future.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nTo compensate for her inability to see the future, Mysa trained in the mystic arts on the planet [[Sorcerers' World|Zerox]], known as the 'Sorcerer's World', under the tutelage of five instructors (each having their own specialty - Air, Earth, Fire, Light and Water) and became an accomplished [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] instead. Mysa showed a remarkable aptitude for magic and easily excelled in her studies \u2014 much to the chagrin of the envious Mordru. Originally, she had red hair, but as she trained in magic, her hair and skin became chalk white and her eyes bright red. This change happened gradually after Dream Girl freed her from the \"Hag\" guise.\n\nShe first appeared in ''Adventure Comics'' #350 as the Hag, an apparently ancient magic user and an agent of the villainous [[Prince Evillo]]. When the Legion fought Evillo, two mysterious \"new\" members, \"Sir Prize\" and \"Miss Terious\", (actually [[Star Boy]] and Dream Girl) cast a spell that restored her to her true form. It was later revealed that this transformation had been worked by the villainous wizard [[Mordru]].\n\nShe joined the Legion after helping them defeat [[Darkseid]] in the famous Legion story, the [[Great Darkness Saga]]. Mysa proved herself a valuable member, often coming to member's aid with a handy spell or two. One feature that set the White Witch apart from the typical comic book sorcerer was a specific limitation on her spell-casting ability; she could only memorize a few spells at a time. Unlike characters like Dr. Fate, Mysa required study before casting a spell.\n\nThe White Witch played a prominent part in the so-called \"Magic Wars\", which concluded ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 3).\n\nSome years later, after leaving the Legion, she married the presumedly-reformed Mordru and lived with him on the planet Tharn, which was, at that point, subdued and invaded by Mordru's magics. She was subjected to mystical imprisonment and manipulation during this period until the Legionnaires returned looking for her and their comrade Rond Vidar. Mysa was also a physical vessel for the disembodied soul of [[Amethyst (comics)|Amethyst]], one of the [[Lords of Order]] who is currently active in the present day DC Universe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} It was this incarnation of the Legion's near defeat that led Mysa to take up arms against her husband, and she later rejoined the group. Right before [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], she was de-aged by Glorith to a teenager and appeared happy with the change. She assumed the codename Jewel and went underground with her fellow Legionnaires.\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Reboot version===\nIn post-''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' continuity, Mysa was no longer Dream Girl's sister from Naltor, but rather, the daughter of Mordru.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe only survivor of a group of sorcerers who imprisoned Mordru, she spent a century preparing for his return, including planting the seeds for [[Kinetix|Zoe Saugin]]'s powers and manipulating much of the girl's life to make her an ally against Mordru's next rise.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} After Mordru rose again, Mysa (who resembled the pre-''Zero Hour'' Hag at this point) was reverted to the age at which she first defeated him and helped the Legion imprison him once more.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nMysa settled on Sorcerer's World and fell in love with [[Dragonmage]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Threeboot version===\nIn the \"[[Legion of Super-Heroes#\"Threeboot\" continuity (2004\u20132009)|Threeboot]]\" continuity, White Witch has appeared as a member of [[Lightning Lord|Mekt Ranzz]]'s [[Wanderers (comics)|Wanderers]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Her home planet is listed as \"unknown\".\n\n===Post-Infinite Crisis===\nIn ''[[Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' storyarc, featuring a group of Legionnaires based on the original, pre-''Crisis'' incarnation, [[Spider Girl]] traded Mysa to [[Mordru]] in return for not attacking Earth.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #860</ref> At the conclusion of the story, [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]] comments to [[Superman]] that [[Dawnstar]] has a lock on Mysa's location, while [[Chameleon Girl]] assures [[Superman]] that the Legion will find their remaining lost teammates.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #863</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Legion of Three Worlds]]'' limited series, the White Witch is imprisoned on Sorcerer's World by Mordru until she is freed by members of the Legion, including [[Blok (comics)|Blok]].<ref name=\"final2\">''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #2</ref> It is revealed at this point that Blok and Mysa are in a relationship. Their escape, however, is thwarted by Mordru, and then [[Superboy-Prime]]'s [[Legion of Super-Villains]]. Mysa uses [[Dawnstar]]'s tracking ability to open a portal directly to Legion headquarters. Fellow Legionnaire, Green Lantern Rond Vidar, forces his teammates through the portal to prevent the LSV from following. Back at Legion headquarters, Mysa attempts another portal to rescue Rond but is too late as he is killed by Superboy-Prime.<ref name=\"final2\"/>\n\nBrainiac 5 then enlists the White Witch to cast a seance spell on an old Justice League space-time crystal ball to bring the \"Reboot\" and \"Threeboot\" Legions to aid in their battle against Superboy-Prime.<ref>''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #3</ref>\n\nIn the midst of battle, \"Reboot\" Legionnaire [[Kinetix]], who possesses magic-based powers, is killed by Superboy-Prime while Mordru absorbs her life-force and all of her magical powers. Because her home reality was destroyed during the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Kinetix also possessed all of that universe's magic energies, now passed on to Mordru.<ref>''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #4</ref> Mordru began using his vastly increased powers in the villains' favor and launches a brutal attack on Blok to draw out Mysa. She reluctantly attacks Mordru with one of his own dark spells that allows her to steal his life-force and magics in a bright blaze of light. Mysa re-emerges as the '''Black Witch''' with a black costume and hair, using her increased powers to defeat most of the villains single-handedly.<ref name=\"final5\">''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #5</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of the story, the Black Witch remains a member of the Legion. However, Blok senses great trouble with his love's transformation. His concern increases as she returns to Sorcerer's World and claims Mordru's throne, vowing a vigilance against evil.<ref name=\"final5\"/>\n\nLater, Blok again reaches the [[Sorcerers' World]], only to find the Black Witch sitting on a throne in front of several spellcasters imprisoned in the stone behind her. Poking out of the wall are the faces of [[Alan Scott]], the Green Lantern wizard [[List of Green Lanterns#Torquemada|Torquemada]], [[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]], [[Zatanna]], [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] and [[Kid Devil]]. Later, both she and Blok cement their relationship, hoping to use Mordru's dark powers for the good of the planet.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #8</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\nAs a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] she is provided a [[Legion Flight Ring]]. It allows her to fly and protects her from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments.\n\n==In other media==\nThe White Witch appeared in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' episode \"Trials\", not as a Legionnaire, but as an illusionary/holographic guide within an enchanted bracelet. She would direct the banished wizard Zyx in his attempt to regain his magic through certain trials.

Her real name is '''Mysa Nal''', although her name was given as '''Xola Aq''' in [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Legion stories in ''[[Adventure Comics]]''; the revelation that her name was actually Mysa Nal was a later [[retcon]]. She is the sister of fellow Legionnaire [[Nura Nal|Dream Girl]] and daughter of former High Seer of [[Naltor]] Kiwa Nal. Like Dream Girl, she is a native of the planet Naltor, where nearly everyone has the power of [[precognition]]; however, unlike most Naltorians, Mysa cannot foresee the future.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nTo compensate for her inability to see the future, Mysa trained in the mystic arts on the planet [[Sorcerers' World|Zerox]], known as the 'Sorcerer's World', under the tutelage of five instructors (each having their own specialty - Air, Earth, Fire, Light and Water) and became an accomplished [[magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] instead. Mysa showed a remarkable aptitude for magic and easily excelled in her studies \u2014 much to the chagrin of the envious Mordru. Originally, she had red hair, but as she trained in magic, her hair and skin became chalk white and her eyes bright red. This change happened gradually after Dream Girl freed her from the \"Hag\" guise.\n\nShe first appeared in ''Adventure Comics'' #350 as the Hag, an apparently ancient magic user and an agent of the villainous [[Prince Evillo]]. When the Legion fought Evillo, two mysterious \"new\" members, \"Sir Prize\" and \"Miss Terious\", (actually [[Star Boy]] and Dream Girl) cast a spell that restored her to her true form. It was later revealed that this transformation had been worked by the villainous wizard [[Mordru]].\n\nShe joined the Legion after helping them defeat [[Darkseid]] in the famous Legion story, the [[Great Darkness Saga]]. Mysa proved herself a valuable member, often coming to member's aid with a handy spell or two. One feature that set the White Witch apart from the typical comic book sorcerer was a specific limitation on her spell-casting ability; she could only memorize a few spells at a time. Unlike characters like Dr. Fate, Mysa required study before casting a spell.\n\nThe White Witch played a prominent part in the so-called \"Magic Wars\", which concluded ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 3).\n\nSome years later, after leaving the Legion, she married the presumedly-reformed Mordru and lived with him on the planet Tharn, which was, at that point, subdued and invaded by Mordru's magics. She was subjected to mystical imprisonment and manipulation during this period until the Legionnaires returned looking for her and their comrade Rond Vidar. Mysa was also a physical vessel for the disembodied soul of [[Amethyst (comics)|Amethyst]], one of the [[Lords of Order]] who is currently active in the present day DC Universe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} It was this incarnation of the Legion's near defeat that led Mysa to take up arms against her husband, and she later rejoined the group. Right before [[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]], she was de-aged by Glorith to a teenager and appeared happy with the change. She assumed the codename Jewel and went underground with her fellow Legionnaires.\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Reboot version===\nIn post-''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' continuity, Mysa was no longer Dream Girl's sister from Naltor, but rather, the daughter of Mordru.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe only survivor of a group of sorcerers who imprisoned Mordru, she spent a century preparing for his return, including planting the seeds for [[Kinetix|Zoe Saugin]]'s powers and manipulating much of the girl's life to make her an ally against Mordru's next rise.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} After Mordru rose again, Mysa (who resembled the pre-''Zero Hour'' Hag at this point) was reverted to the age at which she first defeated him and helped the Legion imprison him once more.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nMysa settled on Sorcerer's World and fell in love with [[Dragonmage]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Threeboot version===\nIn the \"[[Legion of Super-Heroes#\"Threeboot\" continuity (2004\u20132009)|Threeboot]]\" continuity, White Witch has appeared as a member of [[Lightning Lord|Mekt Ranzz]]'s [[Wanderers (comics)|Wanderers]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Her home planet is listed as \"unknown\".\n\n===Post-Infinite Crisis===\nIn ''[[Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' storyarc, featuring a group of Legionnaires based on the original, pre-''Crisis'' incarnation, [[Spider Girl]] traded Mysa to [[Mordru]] in return for not attacking Earth.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #860</ref> At the conclusion of the story, [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]] comments to [[Superman]] that [[Dawnstar]] has a lock on Mysa's location, while [[Chameleon Girl]] assures [[Superman]] that the Legion will find their remaining lost teammates.<ref>''Action Comics'' (vol. 1) #863</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Legion of Three Worlds]]'' limited series, the White Witch is imprisoned on Sorcerer's World by Mordru until she is freed by members of the Legion, including [[Blok (comics)|Blok]].<ref name=\"final2\">''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #2</ref> It is revealed at this point that Blok and Mysa are in a relationship. Their escape, however, is thwarted by Mordru, and then [[Superboy-Prime]]'s [[Legion of Super-Villains]]. Mysa uses [[Dawnstar]]'s tracking ability to open a portal directly to Legion headquarters. Fellow Legionnaire, Green Lantern Rond Vidar, forces his teammates through the portal to prevent the LSV from following. Back at Legion headquarters, Mysa attempts another portal to rescue Rond but is too late as he is killed by Superboy-Prime.<ref name=\"final2\"/>\n\nBrainiac 5 then enlists the White Witch to cast a seance spell on an old Justice League space-time crystal ball to bring the \"Reboot\" and \"Threeboot\" Legions to aid in their battle against Superboy-Prime.<ref>''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #3</ref>\n\nIn the midst of battle, \"Reboot\" Legionnaire [[Kinetix]], who possesses magic-based powers, is killed by Superboy-Prime while Mordru absorbs her life-force and all of her magical powers. Because her home reality was destroyed during the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Kinetix also possessed all of that universe's magic energies, now passed on to Mordru.<ref>''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #4</ref> Mordru began using his vastly increased powers in the villains' favor and launches a brutal attack on Blok to draw out Mysa. She reluctantly attacks Mordru with one of his own dark spells that allows her to steal his life-force and magics in a bright blaze of light. Mysa re-emerges as the '''Black Witch''' with a black costume and hair, using her increased powers to defeat most of the villains single-handedly.<ref name=\"final5\">''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #5</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of the story, the Black Witch remains a member of the Legion. However, Blok senses great trouble with his love's transformation. His concern increases as she returns to Sorcerer's World and claims Mordru's throne, vowing a vigilance against evil.<ref name=\"final5\"/>\n\nLater, Blok again reaches the [[Sorcerers' World]], only to find the Black Witch sitting on a throne in front of several spellcasters imprisoned in the stone behind her. Poking out of the wall are the faces of [[Alan Scott]], the Green Lantern wizard [[List of Green Lanterns#Torquemada|Torquemada]], [[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]], [[Zatanna]], [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] and [[Kid Devil]]. Later, both she and Blok cement their relationship, hoping to use Mordru's dark powers for the good of the planet.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #8</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\nAs a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] she is provided a [[Legion Flight Ring]]. It allows her to fly and protects her from the vacuum of space and other dangerous environments.\n\n==In other media==\nThe White Witch appeared in the ''[[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' episode \"Trials\", not as a Legionnaire, but as an illusionary/holographic guide within an enchanted bracelet. She would direct the banished wizard Zyx in his attempt to regain his magic through certain trials.

The French planned to land 5,000-6,000 soldiers in North-East [[Scotland]] to support a rising by local [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], that would restore [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] to the throne of Great Britain. \n\nDespite French commander [[Claude de Forbin]] warning the chances of evading the [[Royal Navy]] long enough to land his troops were extremely limited, his fleet of small [[privateers]] reached Scotland in March 1708. As he had forecast, he was unable to disembark the troops and returned home, narrowly escaping a pursuing British naval force.\n\nSuch attempts reflected a fundamental and continuing divergence of objectives; while the Stuarts wanted to regain their throne, for the French, they were a simple and low-cost way to absorb British resources. Much of the [[Royal Navy]] was occupied chasing de Forbin, while troops were diverted from Ireland and Southern England. This made it successful for France, but a failure for the Jacobites. \n\n==Background==\n{{Main|War of the Spanish Succession}}\n[[File:Claude de Forbin.jpg|thumb|left|French Admiral [[Claude de Forbin]] (1656-1733); he had little faith in the expedition from the start]]\nUnder the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], [[Louis XIV]] withdrew support from the exiled [[James II]], and recognised [[William III of England|William III]] as legitimate monarch. However, when James died on 16 September 1701, he reneged on this, and proclaimed his son [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] King of England and Scotland. The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began soon after; William died in March 1702 and was succeeded by the last Stuart monarch, James' Protestant daughter [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]].{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=340}}\n\nBy the end of 1707, the war had reached stalemate; despite victories in [[Flanders]], the Allies had been unable to break French border defences, or place their candidate on the Spanish throne. Both sides attempted to use internal conflicts to break the deadlock; Britain supported the [[Camisard|Camisard rebels]] in South-West France, with the Jacobites serving a similar function for the French.{{sfn|Owen|1938|p=238}}\n\nJacobite agent [[Nathaniel Hooke (Jacobite)|Nathaniel Hooke]] convinced Louis there was an opportunity for a Scottish rising, which would divert British troops from Europe. The [[Acts of Union 1707|1707 Act of Union]] was widely unpopular in Scotland, while French [[privateer]]s caused enormous losses for their maritime trade, and the coastal fishing industry.{{sfn|Whatley|2011|p=55}} Protecting Scottish shipping was not a priority for the [[Royal Navy]], which faced multiple demands on its resources for escorting merchant convoys.{{sfn|Journal of the House of Lords|1708|pp=405\u2013423}}\n\nHooke visited Scotland in 1707, meeting supporters like the [[Charles Hay, 13th Earl of Erroll|Earl of Erroll]], while elderly Jacobite [[Thomas Buchan]] provided reports on bases at [[Fort William, Highland|Fort William]] and [[Inverness]].{{sfn|Hopkins|2004}} Senior nobles like the Dukes of [[John_Murray,_1st_Duke_of_Atholl|Atholl]] and [[James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton|Hamilton]] refused to commit, partly due to an attempt in 1703 by [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Simon Fraser, later Lord Lovat]], to implicate them in a Jacobite plot as part of a personal feud.{{sfn|Lord|2004|p=34}} However, Hooke obtained a letter of support signed by Erroll, the [[James Maule, 4th Earl of Panmure|Earl of Panmure]] and six others, promising 25,000 men, and requesting 8,000 French troops, weapons, money, artillery, ammunition and \u2018majors, lieutenants and serjeants to discipline\u2019 the Scots army.{{sfn|Sinclair-Stevenson|1971}}\n\nIn addition, supposed Jacobite Presbyterian [[John Ker]] claimed some [[Cameronian|radical Presbyterians or Cameronians]] supported the Stuarts since 'they are persuaded (Union) will bring an infinite number of calamities upon this nation, and render the Scots slaves to the English.'{{sfn|Sinclair-Stevenson|1971}} This was because they viewed union as a threat to Presbyterian [[Church of Scotland]], despite the [[Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707|Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act]].{{sfn|Bowie|2003|p=229}} While the Cameronians were certainly considering this as an option, Ker was a government agent, whose role was to persuade them not to do so.{{sfn|Douglas|2008}}\n\nLouis decided there was enough support to begin planning in November 1707; this was supervised by the [[Louis Ph\u00e9lypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain|Comte de Pontchartrain]], who had been involved with previous attempts in 1692 and 1696. [[Claude de Forbin]] was appointed commander of the naval squadron, with the [[Charles-Auguste de Goyon|Comte de Gac\u00e9]] in charge of the landing force.{{sfn|Sinclair-Stevenson|1971}}\n\n==The Expedition==\n[[File:George Byng (1663-1733), 1st Viscount Torrington.jpg|thumb|right|British commander [[George Byng, 1st Viscount Torrington|Sir George Byng]] (1663-1733); ca 1700.]]\nAs the [[Royal Navy]] patrolled exits from the French Channel ports, naval operations often took place during the winter months, when wind and tides made it harder to enforce a blockade. However, it also increased risks from the weather; conditions off North-East Scotland were well-known to French privateers and de Forbin's biggest concern was lack of a confirmed landing place. He later recorded 'the Minister did not mention any port in a condition to receive us, ...or where our fleet might anchor and... troops disembark in safety.'{{sfn|Sinclair-Stevenson|1971}}\n\nBased on information supplied by French captains, de Forbin told Pontchartrain and Louis XIV the expedition had no chance of success, but planning continued. The fleet assembled at [[Dunkirk]], a major privateer base for centuries, since ships could reach the [[River Thames|Thames]] in a single tide, allowing them to reach as far north as the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]].{{sfn|Bromley|1987|p=233}} By the end of February, 5,000 - 6,000 troops were ready to embark, joined by James himself on 9 March.{{sfn|Owen|1938|p=238}}\n\nRather than slow-moving transports, de Forbin insisted on using a larger number of small but fast privateers, many of which reduced their crews and offloaded guns to accommodate the troops. While this improved their chances of avoiding the Royal Navy, they could not hope to defeat them in a naval battle.{{sfn|Owen|1938|p=250}}\n\nThe British had been monitoring French preparations, and a squadron under [[George Byng, 1st Viscount Torrington|Sir George Byng]] now arrived off the nearby port of [[Gravelines]]. This prevented the French departure and since James was ill with measles, the troops were disembarked while he recovered. After a week, Byng returned to port for resupply; James and the soldiers were re-loaded, and on 17 March the French force of 30 privateers and five warships left Dunkirk.{{sfn|Lenman|1980|p=88}}\n[[File:Confiance Kent fight.jpg|thumb|left|Merchant ship (left), battling a much smaller [[privateer]] (right); these small but fast vessels formed the bulk of [[Claude de Forbin]]'s fleet]]\nAlthough their departure was immediately delayed by a two day gale, it forced Byng to take shelter, enabling the French to make for the [[Firth of Forth]]. Rather than following the coastline, de Forbin kept out to sea to avoid being spotted, and ended up north of the proposed landing site. On 25 March, the French anchored near [[Fife Ness]], then spent the next day searching for a landing place, allowing Byng to catch up with them. Despite James' protests, the French privateers could not face the British in battle and headed north; they then spent two days attempting to enter the [[Moray Firth]] before giving up. Most of them made it back to Dunkirk, despite being pursued by the British around the north of Scotland and west of Ireland, but sustained severe damage to both ships and men.{{sfn|Owen|1938|pp=255-263}}\n\nHearing news of the French fleet, some of the Jacobite gentry, including James Stirling of [[Keir House]] and four others, gathered at [[Brig o' Turk]]. They were arrested, imprisoned in [[Newgate Prison]] in London, then later transferred to [[Edinburgh Castle]] where they were tried for [[high treason]].{{sfn|Mitchell|1905|=87}} They were acquitted of this charge, as the evidence against them proved only that they had drunk to James' health.{{sfn|Cobbett|1828|p=1395}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nPerceptions of the expedition's value reflect a fundamental divergence of objectives between France and their Jacobite allies.

The French planned to land 5,000-6,000 soldiers in North-East [[Scotland]] to support a rising by local [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], that would restore [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] to the throne of Great Britain. \n\nDespite French commander [[Claude de Forbin]] warning the chances of evading the [[Royal Navy]] long enough to land his troops were extremely limited, his fleet of small [[privateers]] reached Scotland in March 1708. As he had forecast, he was unable to disembark the troops and returned home, narrowly escaping a pursuing British naval force.\n\nSuch attempts reflected a fundamental and continuing divergence of objectives; while the Stuarts wanted to regain their throne, for the French, they were a simple and low-cost way to absorb British resources. Much of the [[Royal Navy]] was occupied chasing de Forbin, while troops were diverted from Ireland and Southern England. This made it successful for France, but a failure for the Jacobites. \n\n==Background==\n{{Main|War of the Spanish Succession}}\n[[File:Claude de Forbin.jpg|thumb|left|French Admiral [[Claude de Forbin]] (1656-1733); he had little faith in the expedition from the start]]\nUnder the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], [[Louis XIV]] withdrew support from the exiled [[James II]], and recognised [[William III of England|William III]] as legitimate monarch. However, when James died on 16 September 1701, he reneged on this, and proclaimed his son [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] King of England and Scotland. The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began soon after; William died in March 1702 and was succeeded by the last Stuart monarch, James' Protestant daughter [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]].{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=340}}\n\nBy the end of 1707, the war had reached stalemate; despite victories in [[Flanders]], the Allies had been unable to break French border defences, or place their candidate on the Spanish throne. Both sides attempted to use internal conflicts to break the deadlock; Britain supported the [[Camisard|Camisard rebels]] in South-West France, with the Jacobites serving a similar function for the French.{{sfn|Owen|1938|p=238}}\n\nJacobite agent [[Nathaniel Hooke (Jacobite)|Nathaniel Hooke]] convinced Louis there was an opportunity for a Scottish rising, which would divert British troops from Europe. The [[Acts of Union 1707|1707 Act of Union]] was widely unpopular in Scotland, while French [[privateer]]s caused enormous losses for their maritime trade, and the coastal fishing industry.{{sfn|Whatley|2011|p=55}} Protecting Scottish shipping was not a priority for the [[Royal Navy]], which faced multiple demands on its resources for escorting merchant convoys.{{sfn|Journal of the House of Lords|1708|pp=405\u2013423}}\n\nHooke visited Scotland in 1707, meeting supporters like the [[Charles Hay, 13th Earl of Erroll|Earl of Erroll]], while elderly Jacobite [[Thomas Buchan]] provided reports on bases at [[Fort William, Highland|Fort William]] and [[Inverness]].{{sfn|Hopkins|2004}} Senior nobles like the Dukes of [[John_Murray,_1st_Duke_of_Atholl|Atholl]] and [[James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton|Hamilton]] refused to commit, partly due to an attempt in 1703 by [[Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat|Simon Fraser, later Lord Lovat]], to implicate them in a Jacobite plot as part of a personal feud.{{sfn|Lord|2004|p=34}} However, Hooke obtained a letter of support signed by Erroll, the [[James Maule, 4th Earl of Panmure|Earl of Panmure]] and six others, promising 25,000 men, and requesting 8,000 French troops, weapons, money, artillery, ammunition and \u2018majors, lieutenants and serjeants to discipline\u2019 the Scots army.{{sfn|Sinclair-Stevenson|1971}}\n\nIn addition, supposed Jacobite Presbyterian [[John Ker]] claimed some [[Cameronian|radical Presbyterians or Cameronians]] supported the Stuarts since 'they are persuaded (Union) will bring an infinite number of calamities upon this nation, and render the Scots slaves to the English.'{{sfn|Sinclair-Stevenson|1971}} This was because they viewed union as a threat to Presbyterian [[Church of Scotland]], despite the [[Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707|Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act]].{{sfn|Bowie|2003|p=229}} While the Cameronians were certainly considering this as an option, Ker was a government agent, whose role was to persuade them not to do so.{{sfn|Douglas|2008}}\n\nLouis decided there was enough support to begin planning in November 1707; this was supervised by the [[Louis Ph\u00e9lypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain|Comte de Pontchartrain]], who had been involved with previous attempts in 1692 and 1696. [[Claude de Forbin]] was appointed commander of the naval squadron, with the [[Charles-Auguste de Goyon|Comte de Gac\u00e9]] in charge of the landing force.{{sfn|Sinclair-Stevenson|1971}}\n\n==The Expedition==\n[[File:George Byng (1663-1733), 1st Viscount Torrington.jpg|thumb|right|British commander [[George Byng, 1st Viscount Torrington|Sir George Byng]] (1663-1733); ca 1700.]]\nAs the [[Royal Navy]] patrolled exits from the French Channel ports, naval operations often took place during the winter months, when wind and tides made it harder to enforce a blockade. However, it also increased risks from the weather; conditions off North-East Scotland were well-known to French privateers and de Forbin's biggest concern was lack of a confirmed landing place. He later recorded 'the Minister did not mention any port in a condition to receive us, ...or where our fleet might anchor and... troops disembark in safety.'{{sfn|Sinclair-Stevenson|1971}}\n\nBased on information supplied by French captains, de Forbin told Pontchartrain and Louis XIV the expedition had no chance of success, but planning continued. The fleet assembled at [[Dunkirk]], a major privateer base for centuries, since ships could reach the [[River Thames|Thames]] in a single tide, allowing them to reach as far north as the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]].{{sfn|Bromley|1987|p=233}} By the end of February, 5,000 - 6,000 troops were ready to embark, joined by James himself on 9 March.{{sfn|Owen|1938|p=238}}\n\nRather than slow-moving transports, de Forbin insisted on using a larger number of small but fast privateers, many of which reduced their crews and offloaded guns to accommodate the troops. While this improved their chances of avoiding the Royal Navy, they could not hope to defeat them in a naval battle.{{sfn|Owen|1938|p=250}}\n\nThe British had been monitoring French preparations, and a squadron under [[George Byng, 1st Viscount Torrington|Sir George Byng]] now arrived off the nearby port of [[Gravelines]]. This prevented the French departure and since James was ill with measles, the troops were disembarked while he recovered. After a week, Byng returned to port for resupply; James and the soldiers were re-loaded, and on 17 March the French force of 30 privateers and five warships left Dunkirk.{{sfn|Lenman|1980|p=88}}\n[[File:Confiance Kent fight.jpg|thumb|left|Merchant ship (left), battling a much smaller [[privateer]] (right); these small but fast vessels formed the bulk of [[Claude de Forbin]]'s fleet]]\nAlthough their departure was immediately delayed by a two day gale, it forced Byng to take shelter, enabling the French to make for the [[Firth of Forth]]. Rather than following the coastline, de Forbin kept out to sea to avoid being spotted, and ended up north of the proposed landing site. On 25 March, the French anchored near [[Fife Ness]], then spent the next day searching for a landing place, allowing Byng to catch up with them. Despite James' protests, the French privateers could not face the British in battle and headed north; they then spent two days attempting to enter the [[Moray Firth]] before giving up. Most of them made it back to Dunkirk, despite being pursued by the British around the north of Scotland and west of Ireland, but sustained severe damage to both ships and men.{{sfn|Owen|1938|pp=255-263}}\n\nHearing news of the French fleet, some of the Jacobite gentry, including James Stirling of [[Keir House]] and four others, gathered at [[Brig o' Turk]]. They were arrested, imprisoned in [[Newgate Prison]] in London, then later transferred to [[Edinburgh Castle]] where they were tried for [[high treason]].{{sfn|Mitchell|1905|=87}} They were acquitted of this charge, as the evidence against them proved only that they had drunk to James' health.{{sfn|Cobbett|1828|p=1395}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nPerceptions of the expedition's value reflect a fundamental divergence of objectives between France and their Jacobite allies. The Stuarts wanted to regain their throne; for the French, they were a useful, low-cost means of absorbing British resources but a Stuart restoration would not change the threat posed by British expansion.{{sfn|Macinnes|1984}}\n\nThe 1708 attempt was a response to the dire military situation France faced as a result of [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Marlborough's]] victories in [[Flanders]].{{sfn|Szechi|1994|p=56}} It occupied large elements of the British and Dutch navies for several months, with Byng ordered to remain in Scotland even after its defeat, while troops were diverted from Ireland and Southern England.
