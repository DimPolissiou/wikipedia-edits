Bromberg'''''<nowiki/>'<nowiki/>''<ref name=ibdb/> and '''Joseph Bromberg''', he performed secondary roles in 35 Broadway productions and 53 motion pictures until 1951. For two decades, Bromberg was highly regarded in the New York theatrical world and was a founding member of the [[Civic Repertory Theatre]] (1928\u20131930) and of the [[Group Theatre (New York)|Group Theatre]] (1931\u20131940).\n\nBromberg made his screen debut in 1936 under contract to [[Twentieth Century-Fox]]. The versatile actor played a wide variety of roles ranging from a ruthless New York newspaper editor (in ''Charlie Chan on Broadway'') to a despotic Arabian sheik (in ''Mr. Moto Takes a Chance''). Although he spoke with no trace of an accent, he was often called upon to play humble immigrants of various nationalities. When [[Warner Oland]], the actor who played [[Charlie Chan]], died in 1938, Fox considered Bromberg as a suitable replacement, but the role ultimately went to [[Sidney Toler]].<ref name=\"baf\" /> Fox began loaning Bromberg to other studios in 1939 and finally dropped him from the roster in 1941. He kept working for various producers, including a stint at [[Universal Pictures]] in the mid-1940s.\n\nBromberg's most outstanding attribute was his facility with sensitive character roles; he could take a standard, undistinguished supporting part and make it unforgettably sympathetic. In ''Hollywood Cavalcade'' he portrays [[Don Ameche]]'s friend who knows he will never get the girl; in ''Three Sons'' he is the lowly business associate who longs to be given a partnership; in ''Easy to Look At'' he is the once-great couturier now reduced to night watchman.\n\nIn September 1950, the anti-communist magazine ''[[Red Channels]]'' accused Bromberg of being a member of the [[American Communist Party]]. Subpoenaed to testify before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] in June 1951, Bromberg refused to answer any questions in accordance with his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights. As a result, he was [[blacklisted]] from working in Hollywood. He suffered enormous stress from the ordeal; friends, such as [[Lee Grant]], noted that he aged considerably in a very short time. \n\n==Death==\nIn 1951 Bromberg sought work in [[England]], but died within the year of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while working in the [[London]] play ''The Biggest Thief in Town''. He was just a few weeks short of his 48th birthday.\n\nIn 1952, he and seven other Group Theater members were named by [[Elia Kazan]] as Communist Party members in testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee.\n\n==Broadway roles==\n{{div col|colwidth=26em}}\n* ''Princess Turandot'' (1926) - Tartaglia and as Ishmael\n* ''[[House of Connelly]]'' (1931) - Duffy\n* ''[[Night Over Taos]]'' (1932) - Pablo Montoya\n* ''[[Both Your Houses]]'' (1933) - Wingblatt\n* ''[[Men in White (play)|Men in White]]'' (1933) - Dr. Hochberg\n* ''[[Gold Eagle Guy]]'' (1934) - Guy Button\n* ''[[Awake and Sing!]]'' (1935) - Uncle Morty\n* ''Jacobowsky and the Colonel'' (1945) - Szabuniewicz \n* ''The Big Knife'' (1949) - Marcus Hoff\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Partial filmography==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* ''[[Under Two Flags (1936 film)|Under Two Flags]]'' (1936) - Col, Ferol\n* ''[[Sins of Man]]'' (1936) - Anton Engel\n* ''[[The Crime of Dr. Forbes]]'' (1936) - Dr. Eric Godfrey\n* ''[[Girls' Dormitory]]'' (1936) - Dr. Spindler\n* ''[[Star for a Night (film)|Star for a Night]]'' (1936) - Doctor Spelimeyer\n* ''[[Ladies in Love]]'' (1936) - Franz Brenner\n* ''[[Reunion (1936 film)|Reunion]]'' (1936) - Charles Renard\n* ''[[Stowaway (1936 film)|Stowaway]]'' (1936) - Judge Booth\n* ''Fair Warning'' (1937) - Matthew Jericho\n* ''[[Seventh Heaven (1937 film)|Seventh Heaven]]'' (1937) - Aristide the Astrologer\n* ''[[That I May Live]]'' (1937) - Tex Shapiro\n* ''[[Charlie Chan on Broadway]]'' (1937) - Murdock\n* ''[[Second Honeymoon (1937 film)|Second Honeymoon]]'' (1937) - Herbie\n* ''[[The Baroness and the Butler]]'' (1938) - Zorda\n* ''[[Sally, Irene and Mary (1938 film)|Sally, Irene and Mary]]'' (1938) - Pawnbroker\n* ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' (1938) - Dr. Hill\n* ''[[Four Men and a Prayer]]'' (1938) - General Torres\n* ''[[One Wild Night (film)|One Wild Night]]'' (1938) - Norman\n* ''[[Mr. Moto Takes a Chance]]'' (1938) - Rajah Ali\n* ''[[I'll Give a Million (1938 film)|I'll Give a Million]]'' (1938) - Editor\n* ''[[Suez (film)|Suez]]'' (1938) - Prince Said\n* ''[[Jesse James (1939 film)|Jesse James]]'' (1939) - Mr. Runyan\n* ''[[Wife, Husband and Friend]]'' (1939) - Rossi\n* ''[[Three Sons]]'' (1939) - Abe Ullman\n* ''[[Hollywood Cavalcade]]'' (1939) - Dave Spingold\n* ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940) - Flaubert\n* ''[[The Return of Frank James]]'' (1940) - George Runyan\n* ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1940) - Don Luis Quintero\n* ''[[Dance Hall (1941 film)|Dance Hall]]'' (1941) - Max Brandon\n* ''[[Hurricane Smith (1941 film)|Hurricane Smith]]'' (1941) - 'Eggs' Bonelli\n* ''[[The Devil Pays Off]]'' (1941) - Arnold DeBrock\n* ''[[Pacific Blackout]]'' (1941) - Pickpocket\n* ''[[Invisible Agent]]'' (1942) - Karl Heiser\n* ''[[Halfway to Shanghai]]'' (1942) - Major Vinpore\n* ''[[Life Begins at Eight-Thirty]]'' (1942) - Sid Gordon\n* ''[[Reunion in France]]'' (1942) - Durand\n* ''[[Tennessee Johnson]]'' (1942) - Coke\n* ''[[Lady of Burlesque]]'' (1943) - S.B.

DVDs are only one of a number of ways of viewing home video.]]\n'''Home video''' is pre-recorded [[video]] media that is either sold, [[video rental shop|rented at a video rental store]] or [[video streaming|streamed]] for home entertainment. It is a type of home media. The term originates from the [[VHS]]/[[Betamax]] era, when the predominant medium was [[videotape]], but has carried over into [[optical disc]] formats like [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] and, since the 2000s, into methods of [[digital distribution]] such as [[Netflix]], [[Hulu]], [[Disney+]], [[Amazon Prime Video]] and others.\n\nThe home video business distributes [[film]]s, [[telemovie]]s, [[television series]] and other audiovisual content in the form of [[video]]s in various formats to the public. These are either bought or rented and then watched privately in consumers' homes. Most theatrically released films are now released on \ndigital media, both optical (DVD and Blu-ray) and download-based, replacing the largely obsolete VHS (Video Home System) medium. The [[Video CD]] format remains popular in Asia, although DVDs are gradually gaining popularity.\n\n==History==\n{{multiple issues|\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n{{weasel words|date=December 2015}}\n}}\nPrior to the arrival of home video as a popular medium, most feature films were essentially inaccessible to the public after their original theatrical runs were over. Some very popular films were given occasional theatrical re-releases in urban [[revival house]]s and the screening rooms of a handful of archives and museums, and beginning in the 1950s, most could be expected to turn up on television eventually. During this era, it was also the norm that [[television]] programs could only be viewed at the time of [[broadcasting|broadcast]]. Viewers were accustomed to the fact that there was no normal way to record TV shows at home and watch them whenever desired.\n\nIt was possible to purchase a [[16 mm film|16&nbsp;mm]] or [[8 mm film|8&nbsp;mm]] film projector and rent or buy home-use prints of some cartoons, short comedies and brief \"highlights\" reels edited from feature films. In the case of the 16&nbsp;mm format, most of these were available with an optical [[soundtrack]], and even some entire feature films in 16&nbsp;mm could be rented or bought. 8&nbsp;mm films almost never ran longer than ten minutes and only a few were available with a magnetic soundtrack late in the life of the format. The [[Super 8 film]] format, introduced in 1965,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://motion.kodak.com/motion/products/production/spotlight_on_super_8/super_8mm_history/index.htm|title=Super 8mm Film History {{!}} Motion Picture Film|website=motion.kodak.com|accessdate=7 June 2016}}</ref> was marketed for making home movies but it also boosted the popularity of show-at-home films. Eventually, longer, edited-down versions of feature films were issued, increasingly with a magnetic soundtrack and in color. But, these were quite expensive and served only a small niche market of very dedicated or affluent film lovers.\n\nThe [[Betamax]] and [[VHS]] home [[videocassette]] formats were introduced in 1975 and 1976<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2006/06/article_0003.html|title=50 Years of the Video Cassette Recorder|website=[[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]]|accessdate=7 June 2016}}</ref> respectively, taking several years and reducing in cost before they started to become a widespread household fixture. Film studios and video distributors assumed that consumers would not want to buy prerecorded videocassettes, just rent them. They also felt that virtually all of the sales would be to [[video rental stores]], setting prices appropriate to this as a business model. The shift to home viewing also changed the movie industry's revenue streams, because home renting created an additional window of time in which a film could make money. In some cases, films that did only modestly in their theater releases went on to have strong performance in the rental market (e.g., [[cult films]]).\n\nMovie rental stores became a popular way to watch home video. Video rental shops are a [[Brick and mortar|physical]] [[retail]] business that rents home videos such as movies, prerecorded TV shows, [[video game]] discs and other content. Typically, a rental shop conducts business with customers under conditions and terms agreed upon in a [[rental agreement]] or [[contract]], which may be implied, explicit, or written. Many video rental stores also sell previously-viewed movies and/or new, lots of unopened movies. \n\nIn the 1980s, video rental stores rented [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] tapes of movies, although most stores dropped Beta tapes when VHS won the [[Videotape format war|format war]] late in the decade. \n\n[[File:Videothek innenraum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Movie boxes on display at a [[video rental store]].]]\nEventually it was realized that many people did want to build their own video libraries as well as rent [[law of demand|if the price was right]], and found that a title which had sold a few hundred copies at $99 might sell tens or even hundreds of thousands of copies at $19.99 or $9.99. The first company to duplicate and distribute home video was [[Magnetic Video]] in 1977. Magnetic Video was established in 1968 as an audio and video duplication service for professional audio and television corporations in [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]], United States, although [[Avco]]'s 1972 [[Cartrivision]] system preceded Magnetic Vision's expansion into home video by a few years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/alternate-magnetic-video-corporation-licensees.313493/|title=Alternate Magnetic Video Corporation Licensees|website=Alternate History Discussion|accessdate=7 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Special-interest video production===\nUntil the mid-1980s feature film theatrical releases such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' were the mainstay of video marketing and helmed by large studios like [[Universal Studios|Universal]], [[20th Century Fox]] and [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney]]. At that time, not many consumers owned a [[VCR]], and those who did tended to rent rather than buy videos. Toward the end of that decade, a rise of smaller companies began creating special interest videos, also known as \"non-theatrical programming\" and \"alternative programming,\" and \"selling-through\" to the consumer.\n<blockquote>\n\"limitations within the video marketplace may be gone tomorrow. More people are finding innovative ways to create visually stimulating entertainment and information for the video tape player... Like contemporary book publishing, you can produce and distribute yourself to very narrow markets or seek broad-based distributors for mass-oriented appeal\"<ref name=\"PMA1\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nSpecial interest video widened the number of topics and audiences to include \"...dog handling videos, back pain videos and cooking videos\", which were not previously thought of as marketable. Next, even \"golf and skiing tapes* started selling. Contemporary sources noted that \"new technology has changed the territory\" of the home video market.<ref name=\"PMA2\"/>\n\n===Decline of videotape and ride of DVDs===\n[[File:Fate of videotape ubt.JPG|thumb|right|200px|By the 2000s decade, home video consumers moved away from videotapes, increasingly preferring DVDs. Pictured is a cart of used videotape movies on sale at a secondhand market.]]\n\nIn the early 2000s (decade) in the prerecorded video market, VHS began to be displaced by [[DVD]]. The DVD format has several advantages over VHS tape. A DVD is much better able to take repeated viewings than VHS tape, which can crack or break, which makes DVDs a better format from a rental store's perspective. As well, whereas a VHS tape can be erased if it is exposed to a rapidly changing magnetic field of sufficient strength, DVDs and other optical discs are not affected by magnetic fields. \n\nEven though DVDs do not have the problems of tapes, such as breakage of the tape or the cassette mechanism, DVDs can still be damaged by scratches. Another factor for movie rental stores is that DVDs are smaller and take less space to store. DVDs offer a number of advantages for the viewer: DVDs can support both standard 4x3 and widescreen 16x9 screen aspect ratios and DVDs can provide twice the video resolution of VHS. As well, a viewer who wants to skip ahead to the end of a movie can do so much faster with a DVD than with a VHS tape (which has to be rewound). \n\nDVDs can have interactive menus, multiple language tracks, audio commentaries, Closed Captioning and subtitling (with the option of turning the subtitles on or off, or selecting subtitles in several languages). Moreover, a DVD can be played on a computer.\n\nDue to these advantages, by the mid-2000s, DVDs were the dominant form of prerecorded video movies in both the rental film and new movie markets. In the early 2000s, video rental stores began renting mostly [[DVD]]s, a digital format with higher resolution than VHS. In the late 2000s, stores began selling Blu-ray discs, a format that supports [[High-definition television|High Definition]].\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, though, consumers continued to use VCRs to record over-the-air TV shows, because consumers could not make home recordings onto DVDs. This last barrier to DVD domination was broken in the late 2000s, with the advent of inexpensive DVD recorders and other [[digital video recorder]]s (DVRs). DVR devices, which record shows onto a hard disk or flash storage, can be purchased from electronics stores or rented from cable or satellite TV providers. \n\nDespite the mainstream dominance of DVD, VHS continues to have a minor role. The conversion to DVD has led to the marketplace being flooded with used VHS films, which are available at pawnshops and second-hand stores, typically for a much lower price than the equivalent film on a used DVD. As well, due to the large number of VHS players in schools and libraries, VHS tapes are still produced for the educational market.  {{As of|2014|11}}, at least one Public Library in the Detroit, Michigan area has discontinued lending out VHS prerecorded movies. In July 2016, the last known manufacturer of VCRs, [[Funai]], announced that it was ceasing VCR production.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/22/technology/vcr-funai-last/index.html|title=The last VCR will be manufactured this month|last=Sun|first=Yazhou|date=2016-07-22|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2018-01-22|last2=Yan|first2=Sophia}}</ref>\n===Blu-ray===\n[[File:4K Blu Ray early Best Buy release.jpg|thumb|Early 4K Blu-ray release at [[Best Buy]]. A 4K Blu-ray Disc player was also released.]]\n\n[[Blu-ray]] is a [[digital media|digital]] [[optical disc]] [[data storage]] format. It was designed to supersede the [[DVD]] format, and is capable of storing several hours of video in [[HD TV|high-definition]] (HDTV 720p and 1080p). The main application of Blu-ray is as a medium for video material such as [[feature film]]s and for the physical distribution of video games. The name \"Blu-ray\" refers to the [[blue laser]] (which is actually a [[Violet (color)|violet]] laser) used to read the disc, which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is possible with the longer-wavelength red laser used for DVDs.\n\nThe plastic disc is the same size as DVDs and [[Compact disc|CDs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rda-jsc.org/docs/6JSC-ALA-16-LC-response.pdf |title=6JSC/ALA/16/LC response |date=September 13, 2012 |accessdate=January 29, 2014 |publisher=rda-jsc.org |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014091133/http://www.rda-jsc.org/docs/6JSC-ALA-16-LC-response.pdf |archive-date=October 14, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Conventional or pre-BD-XL Blu-ray Discs contain 25&nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]] per layer, with dual-layer discs (50&nbsp;GB) being the industry standard for feature-length video discs. \nHigh-definition (HD) video may be stored on Blu-ray Discs with up to 1920\u00d71080 pixel resolution, at 24 progressive, or 50/60 interlaced, [[Frame rate|frames per second]].

DVDs are only one of a number of ways of viewing home video.]]\n'''Home video''' is pre-recorded [[video]] media that is either sold, [[video rental shop|rented at a video rental store]] or [[video streaming|streamed]] for home entertainment. It is a type of home media. The term originates from the [[VHS]]/[[Betamax]] era, when the predominant medium was [[videotape]], but has carried over into [[optical disc]] formats like [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] and, since the 2000s, into methods of [[digital distribution]] such as [[Netflix]], [[Hulu]], [[Disney+]], [[Amazon Prime Video]] and others.\n\nThe home video business distributes [[film]]s, [[telemovie]]s, [[television series]] and other audiovisual content in the form of [[video]]s in various formats to the public. These are either bought or rented and then watched privately in consumers' homes. Most theatrically released films are now released on \ndigital media, both optical (DVD and Blu-ray) and download-based, replacing the largely obsolete VHS (Video Home System) medium. The [[Video CD]] format remains popular in Asia, although DVDs are gradually gaining popularity.\n\n==History==\n{{multiple issues|\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n{{weasel words|date=December 2015}}\n}}\nPrior to the arrival of home video as a popular medium, most feature films were essentially inaccessible to the public after their original theatrical runs were over. Some very popular films were given occasional theatrical re-releases in urban [[revival house]]s and the screening rooms of a handful of archives and museums, and beginning in the 1950s, most could be expected to turn up on television eventually. During this era, it was also the norm that [[television]] programs could only be viewed at the time of [[broadcasting|broadcast]]. Viewers were accustomed to the fact that there was no normal way to record TV shows at home and watch them whenever desired.\n\nIt was possible to purchase a [[16 mm film|16&nbsp;mm]] or [[8 mm film|8&nbsp;mm]] film projector and rent or buy home-use prints of some cartoons, short comedies and brief \"highlights\" reels edited from feature films. In the case of the 16&nbsp;mm format, most of these were available with an optical [[soundtrack]], and even some entire feature films in 16&nbsp;mm could be rented or bought. 8&nbsp;mm films almost never ran longer than ten minutes and only a few were available with a magnetic soundtrack late in the life of the format. The [[Super 8 film]] format, introduced in 1965,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://motion.kodak.com/motion/products/production/spotlight_on_super_8/super_8mm_history/index.htm|title=Super 8mm Film History {{!}} Motion Picture Film|website=motion.kodak.com|accessdate=7 June 2016}}</ref> was marketed for making home movies but it also boosted the popularity of show-at-home films. Eventually, longer, edited-down versions of feature films were issued, increasingly with a magnetic soundtrack and in color. But, these were quite expensive and served only a small niche market of very dedicated or affluent film lovers.\n\nThe [[Betamax]] and [[VHS]] home [[videocassette]] formats were introduced in 1975 and 1976<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2006/06/article_0003.html|title=50 Years of the Video Cassette Recorder|website=[[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]]|accessdate=7 June 2016}}</ref> respectively, taking several years and reducing in cost before they started to become a widespread household fixture. Film studios and video distributors assumed that consumers would not want to buy prerecorded videocassettes, just rent them. They also felt that virtually all of the sales would be to [[video rental stores]], setting prices appropriate to this as a business model. The shift to home viewing also changed the movie industry's revenue streams, because home renting created an additional window of time in which a film could make money. In some cases, films that did only modestly in their theater releases went on to have strong performance in the rental market (e.g., [[cult films]]).\n\nMovie rental stores became a popular way to watch home video. Video rental shops are a [[Brick and mortar|physical]] [[retail]] business that rents home videos such as movies, prerecorded TV shows, [[video game]] discs and other content. Typically, a rental shop conducts business with customers under conditions and terms agreed upon in a [[rental agreement]] or [[contract]], which may be implied, explicit, or written. Many video rental stores also sell previously-viewed movies and/or new, lots of unopened movies. \n\nIn the 1980s, video rental stores rented [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] tapes of movies, although most stores dropped Beta tapes when VHS won the [[Videotape format war|format war]] late in the decade. \n\n[[File:Videothek innenraum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Movie boxes on display at a [[video rental store]].]]\nEventually it was realized that many people did want to build their own video libraries as well as rent [[law of demand|if the price was right]], and found that a title which had sold a few hundred copies at $99 might sell tens or even hundreds of thousands of copies at $19.99 or $9.99. The first company to duplicate and distribute home video was [[Magnetic Video]] in 1977. Magnetic Video was established in 1968 as an audio and video duplication service for professional audio and television corporations in [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]], United States, although [[Avco]]'s 1972 [[Cartrivision]] system preceded Magnetic Vision's expansion into home video by a few years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/alternate-magnetic-video-corporation-licensees.313493/|title=Alternate Magnetic Video Corporation Licensees|website=Alternate History Discussion|accessdate=7 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Special-interest video production===\nUntil the mid-1980s feature film theatrical releases such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' were the mainstay of video marketing and helmed by large studios like [[Universal Studios|Universal]], [[20th Century Fox]] and [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney]]. At that time, not many consumers owned a [[VCR]], and those who did tended to rent rather than buy videos. Toward the end of that decade, a rise of smaller companies began creating special interest videos, also known as \"non-theatrical programming\" and \"alternative programming,\" and \"selling-through\" to the consumer.\n<blockquote>\n\"limitations within the video marketplace may be gone tomorrow. More people are finding innovative ways to create visually stimulating entertainment and information for the video tape player... Like contemporary book publishing, you can produce and distribute yourself to very narrow markets or seek broad-based distributors for mass-oriented appeal\"<ref name=\"PMA1\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nSpecial interest video widened the number of topics and audiences to include \"...dog handling videos, back pain videos and cooking videos\", which were not previously thought of as marketable. Next, even \"golf and skiing tapes* started selling. Contemporary sources noted that \"new technology has changed the territory\" of the home video market.<ref name=\"PMA2\"/>\n\n===Decline of videotape and ride of DVDs===\n[[File:Fate of videotape ubt.JPG|thumb|right|200px|By the 2000s decade, home video consumers moved away from videotapes, increasingly preferring DVDs. Pictured is a cart of used videotape movies on sale at a secondhand market.]]\n\nIn early 2000's (decade) in the prerecorded video market, VHS began to be displaced by [[DVD]]. The DVD format has several advantages over VHS tape. A DVD is much better able to take repeated viewings than VHS tape, which can crack or break, which makes DVDs a better format from a rental store's perspective. As well, whereas a VHS tape can be erased if it is exposed to a rapidly changing magnetic field of sufficient strength, DVDs and other optical discs are not affected by magnetic fields. \n\nEven though DVDs do not have the problems of tapes, such as breakage of the tape or the cassette mechanism, DVDs can still be damaged by scratches. Another factor for movie rental stores is that DVDs are smaller and take less space to store. DVDs offer a number of advantages for the viewer: DVDs can support both standard 4x3 and widescreen 16x9 screen aspect ratios and DVDs can provide twice the video resolution of VHS. As well, a viewer who wants to skip ahead to the end of a movie can do so much faster with a DVD than with a VHS tape (which has to be rewound). \n\nDVDs can have interactive menus, multiple language tracks, audio commentaries, Closed Captioning and subtitling (with the option of turning the subtitles on or off, or selecting subtitles in several languages). Moreover, a DVD can be played on a computer.\n\nDue to these advantages, by the mid-2000s, DVDs were the dominant form of prerecorded video movies in both the rental film and new movie markets. In the early 2000s, video rental stores began renting mostly [[DVD]]s, a digital format with higher resolution than VHS. In the late 2000s, stores began selling Blu-ray discs, a format that supports [[High-definition television|High Definition]].\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, though, consumers continued to use VCRs to record over-the-air TV shows, because consumers could not make home recordings onto DVDs. This last barrier to DVD domination was broken in the late 2000s, with the advent of inexpensive DVD recorders and other [[digital video recorder]]s (DVRs). DVR devices, which record shows onto a hard disk or flash storage, can be purchased from electronics stores or rented from cable or satellite TV providers. \n\nDespite the mainstream dominance of DVD, VHS continues to have a minor role. The conversion to DVD has led to the marketplace being flooded with used VHS films, which are available at pawnshops and second-hand stores, typically for a much lower price than the equivalent film on a used DVD. As well, due to the large number of VHS players in schools and libraries, VHS tapes are still produced for the educational market.  {{As of|2014|11}}, at least one Public Library in the Detroit, Michigan area has discontinued lending out VHS prerecorded movies. In July 2016, the last known manufacturer of VCRs, [[Funai]], announced that it was ceasing VCR production.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/22/technology/vcr-funai-last/index.html|title=The last VCR will be manufactured this month|last=Sun|first=Yazhou|date=2016-07-22|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2018-01-22|last2=Yan|first2=Sophia}}</ref>\n===Blu-ray===\n[[File:4K Blu Ray early Best Buy release.jpg|thumb|Early 4K Blu-ray release at [[Best Buy]].

It was designed to supersede the [[DVD]] format, and is capable of storing several hours of video in [[HD TV|high-definition]] (HDTV 720p and 1080p). The main application of Blu-ray is as a medium for video material such as [[feature film]]s and for the physical distribution of video games. The name \"Blu-ray\" refers to the [[blue laser]] (which is actually a [[Violet (color)|violet]] laser) used to read the disc, which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is possible with the longer-wavelength red laser used for DVDs.\n\nThe plastic disc is the same size as DVDs and [[Compact disc|CDs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rda-jsc.org/docs/6JSC-ALA-16-LC-response.pdf |title=6JSC/ALA/16/LC response |date=September 13, 2012 |accessdate=January 29, 2014 |publisher=rda-jsc.org |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014091133/http://www.rda-jsc.org/docs/6JSC-ALA-16-LC-response.pdf |archive-date=October 14, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Conventional or pre-BD-XL Blu-ray Discs contain 25&nbsp;[[gigabyte|GB]] per layer, with dual-layer discs (50&nbsp;GB) being the industry standard for feature-length video discs. \nHigh-definition (HD) video may be stored on Blu-ray Discs with up to 1920\u00d71080 pixel resolution, at 24 progressive, or 50/60 interlaced, [[Frame rate|frames per second]].

Rowling]] and the seventh and final novel of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. It was released on 21 July 2007 in the United Kingdom by [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], in the United States by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], and in Canada by [[Raincoast Books]]. The novel chronicles the events directly following ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' (2005) and the final confrontation between the wizards [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and [[Lord Voldemort]].\n\n''Deathly Hallows'' shattered sales records upon release, surpassing marks set by previous titles of the ''Harry Potter'' series. It holds the [[Guinness World Record]] for most novels sold within 24 hours of release, with 8.3 million sold in the US and 2.65 million in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/books/22cnd-potter.html|title=Record First-Day Sales for Last \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 Book|work=The New York Times|date=22 July 2007|accessdate=15 December 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216034954/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/books/22cnd-potter.html|archivedate=16 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Guinness Book of World Records\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/Search/Details/Fastestsellingbook-of-fiction-in-24-hours/53237.htm|title=Fastest selling book of fiction in 24 hours|work=Guinness Book of World Records|date=21 July 2007|accessdate=5 February 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919082714/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/Search/Details/Fastestsellingbook-of-fiction-in-24-hours/53237.htm|archivedate=19 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Generally well received by critics, the book won the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award, and the American Library Association named it the \"Best Book for Young Adults\". A film adaptation of the novel was released in two parts: ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1]]'' in November 2010 and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2|Part 2]]'' in July 2011.\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Background===\nThroughout the six previous novels in the [[Harry Potter|series]], the main character [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] has struggled with the difficulties of adolescence along with being famous as the only person ever to survive the [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unforgivable Curses|Killing Curse]], Avada Kedavra. What the wizarding community found most impressive was that he was just a baby when this curse was inflicted. The curse was cast by the evil [[Tom Riddle]], better known as [[Lord Voldemort]], a powerful evil wizard who murdered Harry's parents and attempted to kill Harry as a baby in the belief this would frustrate a [[prophecy]] that Harry would become his equal. [[Lord Voldemort]] had not heard the full [[prophecy]], so he did not know attacking [[Harry Potter]] would transfer power to him. As an [[orphan]], Harry was placed in the care of his [[Muggle]] (non-magical) relatives [[Petunia Dursley]] and [[Vernon Dursley]].\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|The Philosopher's Stone]]'', Harry re-enters the wizarding world at age 11 and enrolls in [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He makes friends with fellow students [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] and is [[mentor]]ed by the school's headmaster, [[Albus Dumbledore]]. He also meets Professor [[Severus Snape]], who intensely dislikes and bullies him. Harry fights Voldemort several times while at school as the wizard tries to regain a physical form. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]]'', Harry is mysteriously entered in a dangerous magical competition called the Triwizard Tournament, which he discovers is a trap designed to allow the return of Lord Voldemort to full strength. During ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]'', Harry and several of his friends face off against Voldemort's [[Death Eaters]], a group of Dark witches and wizards, and narrowly defeat them. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]]'', Harry learns that Voldemort has divided his soul into several parts, creating \"[[Horcrux]]es\" from various unknown objects to contain them. In this way, he has ensured his immortality as long as at least one of the Horcruxes still exists.<ref>Rowling (2005), ''et al''. p. 503.</ref> Two of these had already been destroyed: a diary destroyed by Harry in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]]'' and a ring destroyed by Dumbledore shortly before the events of ''Half-Blood Prince''. Dumbledore takes Harry along in the attempt to destroy a third Horcrux contained in a [[locket]]. However, the Horcrux had been taken by an unknown wizard, and upon their return, Dumbledore is ambushed and disarmed by [[Draco Malfoy]], although Draco cannot bring himself to kill Dumbledore. Dumbledore is subsequently killed by Snape, who finishes what Malfoy started.\n\n===Summary===\nFollowing Albus Dumbledore's death, Voldemort consolidates support and power, including by attempting to take control of the Ministry of Magic. Meanwhile, Harry is about to turn seventeen, at which time he will lose the protection of his home. Members of the [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] explain the situation to the Dursleys and move them to a new location for protection. Using several of Harry's peers and friends as decoys, the Order plans to move Harry to the Burrow under protection. However, the Death Eaters have been tipped off about this plan, and the group is attacked upon departure. In the ensuing battle, [[Alastor Moody|\"Mad-Eye\" Moody]] and Hedwig are killed and [[George Weasley]] severely wounded. Voldemort himself arrives to kill Harry, but Harry's wand fends him off of its own accord.\n\nAt the Burrow, Harry, Ron, and Hermione make preparations to abandon Hogwarts and hunt down Voldemort's four remaining [[Horcrux]]es but have few clues as to their identities and locations. They also inherit strange bequests from among Dumbledore's possessions: a [[Golden Snitch]] for Harry, a [[Deluminator]] for Ron, and a book of short tales collectively called [[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]] for Hermione. During Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding, the [[Ministry of Magic]] finally falls to Voldemort, with a Death Eater assuming the position of Minister for Magic, and the wedding is attacked by Death Eaters. Harry, Ron, and Hermione flee to 12 Grimmauld Place in London, the family home of [[Sirius Black]] that Harry inherited a year before. \n\nWith the help of house-elf Kreacher, they identify R.A.B. as Sirius's deceased brother Regulus and learn that Slytherin's locket was stolen from the house and ultimately seized by [[Dolores Umbridge]] of the Ministry of Magic. They infiltrate the Ministry in disguise and steal back the locket but accidentally break the protection of 12 Grimmauld Place during their escape, forcing them to go on the run in the countryside. With no way to destroy the locket, they argue frequently under the object's evil influence, culminating in Ron abandoning Harry and Hermione. Meanwhile, Harry has visions of Voldemort visiting wand shops and torturing wandmakers, attempting to understand the reason behind Harry's wand's abilities while also mysteriously seeking another wand.\n\nHarry and Hermione continue the quest for the Horcruxes, discovering more about Dumbledore's past, including the death of Dumbledore's younger sister and his connection to the dark wizard [[Gellert Grindelwald]]. They travel to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace, and meet the elderly magical historian Bathilda Bagshot. However, they discover that the real Bathilda has been killed, and it is instead [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] in disguise. The snake attacks, and they barely escape to [[Forest of Dean]], but Harry's wand is damaged beyond repair in the fight. A mysterious silver doe [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] guides Harry to a pond containing the [[Godric Gryffindor's Sword|Sword of Hogwarts co-founder Godric Gryffindor]], one of the few objects able to destroy Horcruxes. When Harry tries to recover the sword, the locket Horcrux tries to kill him. Ron, who was guided back to Harry and Hermione by the Deluminator, saves him and destroys the locket using the sword. \n\nHermione identifies in Dumbledore's book a symbol also worn at Bill and Fleur's wedding by [[Xenophilius Lovegood]], the father of fellow Hogwarts student [[Luna Lovegood]]. They visit Xenophilius and are told the symbol represents the mythical [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]], three objects from an old [[fairy tale]] titled ''[[The Tale of the Three Brothers]]'': the [[Elder Wand]], an unbeatable wand; the Resurrection Stone, which is able to summon the dead; and an infallible Invisibility Cloak. Although Ron and Hermione are skeptical, Harry believes the Hallows are real and suspects Voldemort is hunting the Elder Wand, believing it to be in Dumbledore's possession after defeating Grindelwald. The description of the third Hallow also matches that of his own inherited Invisibility Cloak. Harry's suspicions are confirmed when he has a vision of Voldemort breaking open Dumbledore's tomb and stealing the Elder Wand.\n\nThe trio are captured by Snatchers and taken to [[Malfoy]] Manor. Ron and Harry are imprisoned, and Bellatrix tortures Hermione, believing they stole Gryffindor's sword from her vault at [[Gringotts]]. With the help of [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|Dobby]] the house-elf, they escape to Bill and Fleur's house along with fellow prisoners [[Luna Lovegood]], wandmaker [[Mr. Ollivander]], Dean Thomas, and the goblin [[Griphook]]. During the escape, [[Peter Pettigrew (character)|Peter Pettigrew]] is strangled by his own silver hand after Harry reminds him of his debts, and Dobby is killed by Bellatrix. At Bill and Fleur's, they devise a plan to break into Bellatrix's vault at Gringotts, believing another Horcrux to be hidden there as well. With Griphook's help, they succeed in breaking in, retrieving Hufflepuff's golden cup, and escape on a dragon that was guarding Bellatrix's vault. In the chaos, Griphook steals the Sword of Gryffindor from them. Harry has another vision of Voldemort and sees that Voldemort now understands their plan and intends to protect the Horcruxes even further but also confirms the unidentified Horcrux is at Hogwarts.\n\nThey enter the school through a secret entrance in the [[Hog's Head]], a bar in [[Hogsmeade]] owned by Dumbledore's brother [[Aberforth]]. Harry alerts the teachers that Voldemort is planning an assault on the school, and they mobilize the student body to defend Hogwarts and buy Harry time to locate the Horcrux. After speaking with the ghost of Ravenclaw, Rowena Ravenclaw's daughter, Harry confirms that the Horcrux is Ravenclaw's lost [[diadem]], and he recalls such a diadem being hidden in the [[Room of Requirement]]. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione destroy Hufflepuff's cup with [[basilisk]] fangs taken from the [[Chamber of Secrets]] as Voldemort and his army besiege the castle. They find the diadem but are ambushed by Draco Malfoy and his friends [[Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle|Goyle]]. Crabbe tries to kill them using Fiendfyre, a cursed fire, but is unable to control it; the fire destroys the diadem and kills Crabbe. Meanwhile, many are killed in the Battle of Hogwarts, including [[Remus Lupin]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Colin Creevey]], and [[Fred Weasley]].\n\nIn his encampment, Voldemort feels the Elder Wand is not performing as he expected. Reasoning that Snape, having killed Dumbledore is the true owner of the Elder Wand, Voldemort murders Snape. Harry arrives as Snape is dying, and Snape passes him memories to view in the [[Pensieve]]. They reveal Snape had a lifelong love for Harry's mother, and despite hating Harry's father, he agreed at Dumbledore's request to act as a [[double agent]] against Voldemort. He had been watching over the trio as they searched for the Horcruxes, conjuring the doe Patronus. It is also revealed that Dumbledore was slowly dying after mishandling the ring Horcrux, and his \"murder\" by Snape was planned to prove Snape's allegiance to Voldemort. The memories also explain that Harry himself is a Horcrux, and therefore he must die at Voldemort's hands if Voldemort is to become mortal, which Voldemort does not know. Harry accepts his death and gives himself up to Voldemort, telling [[Neville Longbottom]] that Voldemort's snake Nagini, another Horcrux, must be killed. On the way, he finally manages to open the Snitch and uses the Resurrection Stone within to seek comfort and courage from his dead loved ones. Voldemort uses the [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unforgivable Curses|Killing Curse]], and Harry does not defend himself.\n\nHarry awakens in a dreamlike location resembling [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] and is greeted by Dumbledore. He explains that Voldemort's original Killing Curse left a fragment of Voldemort's soul in Harry, which caused the connection they felt and made Harry an unintended Horcrux. The fragment had been destroyed by the Killing Curse, allowing Harry the choice to return to life or to \"go on.\" Dumbledore also admits some of his mysterious history, in which his friendship with Gellert Grindelwald resulted in the murder of his younger sister Ariana and estrangement from Aberforth. Harry chooses to return to life and feigns death. Voldemort calls for a truce at Hogwarts and displays Harry's body, offering to spare most of the defenders if they surrender. Neville, however, pulls the Sword of Gryffindor out of the Sorting Hat and uses it to behead Nagini, leaving Voldemort unprotected by Horcruxes. \n\nHarry escapes under his cloak as the battle resumes. In a final onslaught, [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] is killed by [[Molly Weasley]], and Harry reveals himself to Voldemort. He explains to Voldemort the Elder Wand's loyalty transfers upon the defeat, not necessarily the killing, of its previous master. Harry also reveals that Snape had never been the Elder Wand's master because Draco Malfoy had disarmed Dumbledore before Snape arrived to kill him, and Harry had disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor weeks prior. Voldemort attempts one final Killing Curse on Harry, but the Elder Wand refuses to act against its true master and the spell rebounds, killing Voldemort. Harry uses the Elder Wand to repair his original wand, intending to return the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's tomb, where its power will vanish if Harry dies undefeated. However, he plans to keep the Invisibility Cloak he inherited. The wizarding world returns to peace once more.\n\n;Epilogue\nIn an epilogue set in [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] 19 years later, the primary characters are seeing their own children off to Hogwarts. Harry and [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] have three children: [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#James Potter|James Sirius]], [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]], and [[Lily Luna Potter|Lily Luna]]. Ron and Hermione also have two children, [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]]. Harry's godson [[Teddy Lupin]] is found kissing [[Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]'s daughter [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]]; [[Neville Longbottom]] is now a Hogwarts professor; and [[Draco Malfoy]] and his wife are also at the station to send off their son, [[Scorpius Malfoy|Scorpius]]. Albus is departing for his first year at Hogwarts and worries he will be placed in Slytherin House.

Other retail chains then also offered the book at discounted prices. At these prices the book became a [[loss leader]]. This caused uproar from traditional UK booksellers who argued they had no hope of competing in those conditions. Independent shops protested loudest, but even [[Waterstone's]], the UK's largest dedicated chain bookstore, could not compete with the supermarket price. Some small bookstores hit back by buying their stock from the supermarkets rather than their wholesalers. Asda attempted to counter this by imposing a limit of two copies per customer to prevent bulk purchases. Philip Wicks, a spokesman for the [[UK Booksellers Association]], said, \"It is a war we can't even participate in. We think it's a crying shame that the supermarkets have decided to treat it as a loss-leader, like a can of baked beans.\" Michael Norris, an analyst at Simba Information, said: \"You are not only lowering the price of the book.

It was released on 21 July 2007 in the United Kingdom by [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], in the United States by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], and in Canada by [[Raincoast Books]]. The novel chronicles the events directly following ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' (2005) and the final confrontation between the wizards [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and [[Lord Voldemort]].\n\n''Deathly Hallows'' shattered sales records upon release, surpassing marks set by previous titles of the ''Harry Potter'' series. It holds the [[Guinness World Record]] for most novels sold within 24 hours of release, with 8.3 million sold in the US and 2.65 million in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/books/22cnd-potter.html|title=Record First-Day Sales for Last \u2018Harry Potter\u2019 Book|work=The New York Times|date=22 July 2007|accessdate=15 December 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216034954/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/books/22cnd-potter.html|archivedate=16 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Guinness Book of World Records\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/Search/Details/Fastestsellingbook-of-fiction-in-24-hours/53237.htm|title=Fastest selling book of fiction in 24 hours|work=Guinness Book of World Records|date=21 July 2007|accessdate=5 February 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919082714/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/Search/Details/Fastestsellingbook-of-fiction-in-24-hours/53237.htm|archivedate=19 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Generally well received by critics, the book won the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award, and the American Library Association named it the \"Best Book for Young Adults\".

What the wizarding community found most impressive was that he was just a baby when this curse was inflicted. The curse was cast by the evil [[Tom Riddle]], better known as [[Lord Voldemort]], a powerful evil wizard who murdered Harry's parents and attempted to kill Harry as a baby in the belief this would frustrate a [[prophecy]] that Harry would become his equal. [[Lord Voldemort]] had not heard the full [[prophecy]], so he did not know attacking [[Harry Potter]] would transfer power to him. As an [[orphan]], Harry was placed in the care of his [[Muggle]] (non-magical) relatives [[Petunia Dursley]] and [[Vernon Dursley]].\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|The Philosopher's Stone]]'', Harry re-enters the wizarding world at age 11 and enrolls in [[Hogwarts|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He makes friends with fellow students [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] and is [[mentor]]ed by the school's headmaster, [[Albus Dumbledore]]. He also meets Professor [[Severus Snape]], who intensely dislikes and bullies him. Harry fights Voldemort several times while at school as the wizard tries to regain a physical form. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]]'', Harry is mysteriously entered in a dangerous magical competition called the Triwizard Tournament, which he discovers is a trap designed to allow the return of Lord Voldemort to full strength. During ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]'', Harry and several of his friends face off against Voldemort's [[Death Eaters]], a group of Dark witches and wizards, and narrowly defeat them. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]]'', Harry learns that Voldemort has divided his soul into several parts, creating \"[[Horcrux]]es\" from various unknown objects to contain them. In this way, he has ensured his immortality as long as at least one of the Horcruxes still exists.<ref>Rowling (2005), ''et al''. p. 503.</ref> Two of these had already been destroyed: a diary destroyed by Harry in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]]'' and a ring destroyed by Dumbledore shortly before the events of ''Half-Blood Prince''. Dumbledore takes Harry along in the attempt to destroy a third Horcrux contained in a [[locket]]. However, the Horcrux had been taken by an unknown wizard, and upon their return, Dumbledore is ambushed and disarmed by [[Draco Malfoy]], although Draco cannot bring himself to kill Dumbledore. Dumbledore is subsequently killed by Snape, who finishes what Malfoy started.\n\n===Summary===\nFollowing Albus Dumbledore's death, Voldemort consolidates support and power, including by attempting to take control of the Ministry of Magic. Meanwhile, Harry is about to turn seventeen, at which time he will lose the protection of his home. Members of the [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] explain the situation to the Dursleys and move them to a new location for protection. Using several of Harry's peers and friends as decoys, the Order plans to move Harry to the Burrow under protection. However, the Death Eaters have been tipped off about this plan, and the group is attacked upon departure. In the ensuing battle, [[Alastor Moody|\"Mad-Eye\" Moody]] and Hedwig are killed and [[George Weasley]] severely wounded. Voldemort himself arrives to kill Harry, but Harry's wand fends him off of its own accord.\n\nAt the Burrow, Harry, Ron, and Hermione make preparations to abandon Hogwarts and hunt down Voldemort's four remaining [[Horcrux]]es but have few clues as to their identities and locations. They also inherit strange bequests from among Dumbledore's possessions: a [[Golden Snitch]] for Harry, a [[Deluminator]] for Ron, and a book of short tales collectively called [[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]] for Hermione. During Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding, the [[Ministry of Magic]] finally falls to Voldemort, with a Death Eater assuming the position of Minister for Magic, and the wedding is attacked by Death Eaters. Harry, Ron, and Hermione flee to 12 Grimmauld Place in London, the family home of [[Sirius Black]] that Harry inherited a year before. \n\nWith the help of house-elf Kreacher, they identify R.A.B. as Sirius's deceased brother Regulus and learn that Slytherin's locket was stolen from the house and ultimately seized by [[Dolores Umbridge]] of the Ministry of Magic. They infiltrate the Ministry in disguise and steal back the locket but accidentally break the protection of 12 Grimmauld Place during their escape, forcing them to go on the run in the countryside. With no way to destroy the locket, they argue frequently under the object's evil influence, culminating in Ron abandoning Harry and Hermione. Meanwhile, Harry has visions of Voldemort visiting wand shops and torturing wandmakers, attempting to understand the reason behind Harry's wand's abilities while also mysteriously seeking another wand.\n\nHarry and Hermione continue the quest for the Horcruxes, discovering more about Dumbledore's past, including the death of Dumbledore's younger sister and his connection to the dark wizard [[Gellert Grindelwald]]. They travel to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace, and meet the elderly magical historian Bathilda Bagshot. However, they discover that the real Bathilda has been killed, and it is instead [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] in disguise. The snake attacks, and they barely escape to [[Forest of Dean]], but Harry's wand is damaged beyond repair in the fight. A mysterious silver doe [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] guides Harry to a pond containing the [[Godric Gryffindor's Sword|Sword of Hogwarts co-founder Godric Gryffindor]], one of the few objects able to destroy Horcruxes. When Harry tries to recover the sword, the locket Horcrux tries to kill him. Ron, who was guided back to Harry and Hermione by the Deluminator, saves him and destroys the locket using the sword. \n\nHermione identifies in Dumbledore's book a symbol also worn at Bill and Fleur's wedding by [[Xenophilius Lovegood]], the father of fellow Hogwarts student [[Luna Lovegood]]. They visit Xenophilius and are told the symbol represents the mythical [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]], three objects from an old [[fairy tale]] titled ''[[The Tale of the Three Brothers]]'': the [[Elder Wand]], an unbeatable wand; the Resurrection Stone, which is able to summon the dead; and an infallible Invisibility Cloak. Although Ron and Hermione are skeptical, Harry believes the Hallows are real and suspects Voldemort is hunting the Elder Wand, believing it to be in Dumbledore's possession after defeating Grindelwald. The description of the third Hallow also matches that of his own inherited Invisibility Cloak. Harry's suspicions are confirmed when he has a vision of Voldemort breaking open Dumbledore's tomb and stealing the Elder Wand.\n\nThe trio are captured by Snatchers and taken to [[Malfoy]] Manor. Ron and Harry are imprisoned, and Bellatrix tortures Hermione, believing they stole Gryffindor's sword from her vault at [[Gringotts]]. With the help of [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|Dobby]] the house-elf, they escape to Bill and Fleur's house along with fellow prisoners [[Luna Lovegood]], wandmaker [[Mr. Ollivander]], Dean Thomas, and the goblin [[Griphook]]. During the escape, [[Peter Pettigrew (character)|Peter Pettigrew]] is strangled by his own silver hand after Harry reminds him of his debts, and Dobby is killed by Bellatrix. At Bill and Fleur's, they devise a plan to break into Bellatrix's vault at Gringotts, believing another Horcrux to be hidden there as well. With Griphook's help, they succeed in breaking in, retrieving Hufflepuff's golden cup, and escape on a dragon that was guarding Bellatrix's vault. In the chaos, Griphook steals the Sword of Gryffindor from them. Harry has another vision of Voldemort and sees that Voldemort now understands their plan and intends to protect the Horcruxes even further but also confirms the unidentified Horcrux is at Hogwarts.\n\nThey enter the school through a secret entrance in the [[Hog's Head]], a bar in [[Hogsmeade]] owned by Dumbledore's brother [[Aberforth]]. Harry alerts the teachers that Voldemort is planning an assault on the school, and they mobilize the student body to defend Hogwarts and buy Harry time to locate the Horcrux. After speaking with the ghost of Ravenclaw, Rowena Ravenclaw's daughter, Harry confirms that the Horcrux is Ravenclaw's lost [[diadem]], and he recalls such a diadem being hidden in the [[Room of Requirement]]. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione destroy Hufflepuff's cup with [[basilisk]] fangs taken from the [[Chamber of Secrets]] as Voldemort and his army besiege the castle. They find the diadem but are ambushed by Draco Malfoy and his friends [[Vincent Crabbe|Crabbe]] and [[Gregory Goyle|Goyle]]. Crabbe tries to kill them using Fiendfyre, a cursed fire, but is unable to control it; the fire destroys the diadem and kills Crabbe. Meanwhile, many are killed in the Battle of Hogwarts, including [[Remus Lupin]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Colin Creevey]], and [[Fred Weasley]].\n\nIn his encampment, Voldemort feels the Elder Wand is not performing as he expected. Reasoning that Snape, having killed Dumbledore is the true owner of the Elder Wand, Voldemort murders Snape. Harry arrives as Snape is dying, and Snape passes him memories to view in the [[Pensieve]]. They reveal Snape had a lifelong love for Harry's mother, and despite hating Harry's father, he agreed at Dumbledore's request to act as a [[double agent]] against Voldemort. He had been watching over the trio as they searched for the Horcruxes, conjuring the doe Patronus. It is also revealed that Dumbledore was slowly dying after mishandling the ring Horcrux, and his \"murder\" by Snape was planned to prove Snape's allegiance to Voldemort. The memories also explain that Harry himself is a Horcrux, and therefore he must die at Voldemort's hands if Voldemort is to become mortal, which Voldemort does not know. Harry accepts his death and gives himself up to Voldemort, telling [[Neville Longbottom]] that Voldemort's snake Nagini, another Horcrux, must be killed. On the way, he finally manages to open the Snitch and uses the Resurrection Stone within to seek comfort and courage from his dead loved ones. Voldemort uses the [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unforgivable Curses|Killing Curse]], and Harry does not defend himself.\n\nHarry awakens in a dreamlike location resembling [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] and is greeted by Dumbledore. He explains that Voldemort's original Killing Curse left a fragment of Voldemort's soul in Harry, which caused the connection they felt and made Harry an unintended Horcrux. The fragment had been destroyed by the Killing Curse, allowing Harry the choice to return to life or to \"go on.\" Dumbledore also admits some of his mysterious history, in which his friendship with Gellert Grindelwald resulted in the murder of his younger sister Ariana and estrangement from Aberforth. Harry chooses to return to life and feigns death. Voldemort calls for a truce at Hogwarts and displays Harry's body, offering to spare most of the defenders if they surrender. Neville, however, pulls the Sword of Gryffindor out of the Sorting Hat and uses it to behead Nagini, leaving Voldemort unprotected by Horcruxes. \n\nHarry escapes under his cloak as the battle resumes. In a final onslaught, [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]] is killed by [[Molly Weasley]], and Harry reveals himself to Voldemort. He explains to Voldemort the Elder Wand's loyalty transfers upon the defeat, not necessarily the killing, of its previous master. Harry also reveals that Snape had never been the Elder Wand's master because Draco Malfoy had disarmed Dumbledore before Snape arrived to kill him, and Harry had disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor weeks prior. Voldemort attempts one final Killing Curse on Harry, but the Elder Wand refuses to act against its true master and the spell rebounds, killing Voldemort. Harry uses the Elder Wand to repair his original wand, intending to return the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's tomb, where its power will vanish if Harry dies undefeated. However, he plans to keep the Invisibility Cloak he inherited. The wizarding world returns to peace once more.\n\n;Epilogue\nIn an epilogue set in [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] 19 years later, the primary characters are seeing their own children off to Hogwarts. Harry and [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] have three children: [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#James Potter|James Sirius]], [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]], and [[Lily Luna Potter|Lily Luna]]. Ron and Hermione also have two children, [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley|Hugo]]. Harry's godson [[Teddy Lupin]] is found kissing [[Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]]'s daughter [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]]; [[Neville Longbottom]] is now a Hogwarts professor; and [[Draco Malfoy]] and his wife are also at the station to send off their son, [[Scorpius Malfoy|Scorpius]]. Albus is departing for his first year at Hogwarts and worries he will be placed in Slytherin House. Harry reassures him by telling his son he is named after two Hogwarts headmasters, one of them a Slytherin and \"the bravest man he had ever met,\" and that the [[Sorting Hat]] could also take account of personal preferences as it did for Harry. Harry also notes that his scar has not hurt in nineteen years and all is well.\n\n==Background==\n===Franchise===\n''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' was published by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]], the publisher of all ''Harry Potter'' books in the United Kingdom, on 30 June 1997.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/820885.stm|title=The Potter phenomenon|date=18 February 2003|work=BBC News|accessdate=27 September 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123221520/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/820885.stm|archivedate=23 November 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was released in the United States on 1 September 1998 by [[Scholastic Press|Scholastic]]\u2014the American publisher of the books\u2014as ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/07022007/news/nationalnews/wild_about_harry_nationalnews_.htm |title=Wild about Harry |work=New York Post |accessdate=27 September 2008 |date=2 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517123016/http://www.nypost.com/seven/07022007/news/nationalnews/wild_about_harry_nationalnews_.htm |archivedate=17 May 2008 }}</ref> after Rowling had received US$105,000 for the American rights\u2014an unprecedented amount for a children's book by a then-unknown author.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/21/business/web21interview.html|title=A Brief Walk Through Time at Scholastic|last=Rozhon|first=Tracie|work=The New York Times|date=21 April 2007|accessdate=21 April 2007|page=C3|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416133919/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/21/business/web21interview.html|archivedate=16 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The second book, ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998, and in the US on 2 June 1999.

Other retail chains then also offered the book at discounted prices. At these prices the book became a [[loss leader]]. This caused uproar from traditional UK booksellers who argued they had no hope of competing in those conditions.

However, they did not recognize the national rights of other nationalities which lived in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary in that time, so Serbs of Vojvodina took action to separate from the Kingdom of Hungary (which was at that time part of Habsburg Austria).\n\nWishing to express their national individuality and confronted with new Hungarian authorities, [[Serbs]] declared the constitution of the ''Serbian Vojvodina'' (Serbian Duchy) at the [[May Assembly]] in [[Sremski Karlovci]] (May 13\u201315, 1848). The Serbian Vojvodina consisted of [[Srem (region)|Srem]] (Syrmia), [[Ba\u010dka]] (Batschka), [[Banat]], and [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]] (Branau) regions.\n\nThe Serbs also formed a political alliance with the Kingdom of [[Croatia]] \"based on freedom and perfect equality\". They also recognized the [[Romanians|Romanian]] nationality. The [[metropolitan of Sremski Karlovci]], [[Josif Raja\u010di\u0107]], was elected for [[patriarch]], while [[Stevan \u0160upljikac]] for the first [[duke]] ([[Voivode|voivod]]). A National committee was formed as the new government of ''Serbian Vojvodina''. Instead of the old feudal regime, a new reign was founded based on the national boards with the Head [[Serbian National Board]] presiding.\n\nBy 1840 data, Serbs formed relative majority of 49.1% in Vojvodina (compared to absolute majority of 51.1% in 1828). Besides Serbs, these areas were also populated by some other ethnic groups such as Hungarians, Germans, Romanians and Croats. The new Hungarian government replied to the Serb political actions by the use of force: on June 12, 1848, a war between Serbs and Hungarians started. Austria took the side of the Kingdom of Hungary at first, while Serbs were aided by volunteers from the [[Principality of Serbia]]. A consequence of this war was the expansion of the conservative factions.\n\nIn early 1849, when the Austrian army lost battle to the Hungarian [[hussar]]s, the feudal and clerical circles of Vojvodina formed an alliance with Austria. Serb troops from Vojvodina then joined the Habsburg army and helped in crushing the revolution in Hungary. With the help of [[Imperial Russia]], the forces of reaction smothered the revolution in the summer of 1849, defeating Hungarian national movement in the Habsburg monarchy.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Hungarian revolution, by a decision of the Austrian [[emperor]], in November 1849, an Austrian crownland known as ''[[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]]'' was formed as the successor of Serbian Vojvodina. However, Serbs were not fully satisfied with the new voivodeship, which was more ethnically mixed and included ethnic Romanian eastern parts of Banat, but excluded some areas with Serb majority.\n\n==Capitals==\n\nThe first capital of Serbian Vojvodina was in [[Sremski Karlovci]]. It was later moved to [[Zemun]], [[Zrenjanin|Veliki Be\u010dkerek]] (today known as Zrenjanin), and [[Timi\u0219oara|Temi\u0161var]] (Timi\u0219oara).\n\n==Flag and coat-of-arms==\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}\nThe coat-of-arms of the Serbian Vojvodina was essentially the Austrian Habsburg imperial arms, with the coat-of-arms of the [[Serbs]] ([[Serbian cross]], with four [[Cyrillic]] letters \"S\", on the chests of the black eagle. The bearer of the Serbian arms was the Austrian black eagle, instead of the Serbian white one, in order to show the fidelity of the newly established Voivodship to the Imperial Court in Vienna. The coat-of-arms was simply added to the Serbian national tricolour.

Cattle were driven up from Texas to this point, and then shipped to major markets. Often cowboys had the run of the town. In 1875 Kansas Pacific closed its cattle pens, moving to another location. The cattle trade dwindled to almost nothing by the mid-1880s.\n\nDuring the late 1860s into the 1870s, Ellsworth was known for being one of the \"wickedest\" cattle towns, the scene of numerous killings following shootouts between drunken [[cowboy]]s.

Scharff, ''Fairbairn Then and Now'' (1998), a text by David Celani which is an application of Fairbairn's model  to domestic violence, ''The Illusion of Love:Why The Battered Woman Returns to Her Abuser'' (1994) , and a second text by Celani on the application of  Fairbairn's model to the treatment of severe personality disorders,  ''Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting'', (2010).\n\n===Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality (1952)===\n\n''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'' (1952) is a collection of papers previously published in different psychoanalytic journals. The book is divided into three parts, the first being mostly theoretical, the second one clinical, and the third one concerning more general problems. The first four articles contain most of Fairbairn's innovative concepts.  Fairbairn's work was a direct challenge to Freud's model of psychoanalysis, including his theory of psychological development, the functions and dynamics of personality, the origins of psychopathology, and the treatment of disordered individuals. In short, his goal was to replace Freudian metapsychology with his own model as noted by Greenberg and Mitchell: <blockquote>In a series of dense and fertile papers written during the  early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref>.</blockquote>Freud's psychoanalytic model is a drive/structure  model  in that it  proposes that  human beings are born with innate, biological drives (sex and aggression) that are contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating)  comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society there is immediate conflict. A new structure has to emerge from the Id  to insure that the drives continue to be expressed in a way permitted by society. Thus the unconscious Id, which is Freud's metaphor for the package  of the (assumed)  biological  drives, is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of the ego. This second structure has the task of mediating  between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development the child internalizes the values of his parents and these internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures; The Id, Ego and Super Ego mature, and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make the morally correct  choices.         \n\nFairbairn's model is a relational/structure model  in that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, and an not from the pressure exerted by the from the Id (which does not exist in Fairbairn's metapsychology). The human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. Internal ego structures can be understood to be packages of  memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to them. Fairbairn's structural theory develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child' under developed central ego to remember.  Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy his necessary illusion that he was loves and cherished. In primitive families where punishment is frequent, the child can be overwhelmed by parental aggression and faces the loss of his sense of self, as described Bromberg in the following quote.     <blockquote>Psychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. ..At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n\n     </blockquote>Over time, these dissociated events, including those where the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process). Thus the human psyche is structured over time based on split off traumas that are unavailable to the individuals central ego. This is a very different structural model when compared to Freud's. In Fairbairn's model the  unconscious is ''developed'' (not inherited) from parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.        \n\n=== Schizoid Factors in the Personality  (1940) ===\nFairbairn's first paper introduced his observation that many of his patient's appeared to be \"schizoid\" a condition that he defined as being a direct result of having splits in their ego structure. He noted that these patients had three observable characteristics.<blockquote>These are (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality....So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn,1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref>      </blockquote>He noted that the schizoid condition was do to split off (dissociated) interpersonal experiences which were unknown to the conscious \"central ego\".  The schizoid style of relating (or rather, non-relating) to others was originated from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love during his developmental years. The schizoid was raised by a mother who was unable  to relate to her child  with tender, loving  emotions  and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world which is safer, but ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out in bold and uncompromising manner as the following quote illustrates.<blockquote>Regressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation  giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a bad object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that...he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (C) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious, (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18)<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>Thus, Fairbairn saw that the lack of love in a young child's life was traumatic, and also caused splits in his ego. Typically, Fairbairn waited until later in his writing to inform the reader how and why certain material was deleted from the child's memory by dissociation, as the first four papers exposed his thought processes as he worked on and developed his full theory.  \n\n=== A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941) ===\nFairbairn gradually formed his model in these first four papers. He  challenged Freud drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless,it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress,the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, this shift in focus was to great for the analytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model  was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian, there were no other options, and Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From his point on, his model was seen as an interesting intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become more powerful than Libido Theory.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentation (separation) from the parent because of he development of a mature, reality based central ego in the child.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" />\n<br /></blockquote>\nThus, the developmental process requires that the individual no longer sees himself as part of his mother, but rather as an independent, fully functioning person.The problem lies in the reality that many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily,as Fairbairn noted in one of his most famous quotes.<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person,and to have his love accepted is the greatest trauma that a child can experience (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n</blockquote>\nFairbairn's language is a bit overwrought, but in essence he says that the dependent child cannot mature with being sure that his parents love and support him, which gives him enough courage to let them go and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, or nearby,  trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Innovative concepts==\n\n===The object-seeking libido===\nOne of the most important contributions of Fairbairn to the psychoanalytic paradigm is proposing an alternative viewpoint regarding the libido. Whereas [[Freud]] assumed that the [[libido]] is pleasure seeking, Fairbairn thought of the libido as object seeking.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Peter Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Peter | title=Introduction to \"Psychoanalysis and after\" | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fairbairn|first=W.

The first connections a child makes are with his parents. Through diverse forms of contact between the child and his parents, a bond between them is formed. When the bond is formed, the child becomes strongly attached to his parents. This early relationship shapes the emotional life of the child in such a strong way that it determines the emotional experiences that the child will have later on in life, because the early libidinal objects become the prototypes for all later experience of connection with others.\n\n===Internal object relations===\nFairbairn states that the [[object relations]] a child has very early on in life become the child's prototypes for all later experiences regarding connections with others. The internal [[object relations|object relation]] describes a relation which exists in the person's mind. In the normal situation, healthy parenting results in a child with an outward orientation towards real people, who can give real contact and exchange. When the needs of the child are not met by the parents (e.g. [[dependency need]]s and the need for affirmative interactions) a pathological turning away from external reality takes place. Instead of actual exchange with others, fantasised, private presences are established, the so-called internal objects. To these internal objects the child relates in fantasised connections, the internal object relations.\n\n===The splitting of the ego===\n{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}\nFairbairn recognized that  children are  totally and absolutely dependent on their parents. Because of this dependency they cannot tolerate \"knowing\" that their parents are indifferent, abandoning, and perhaps even abusive. They solve the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. The defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn had worked in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>as one of his part-time appointments and his experiences with children separated from their families alerted him to the reality that the child's extreme dependency on their parents makes any abandonment a major trauma. The powerful defense called dissociation was needed to erase the event from their consciousness. The memory of the rejecting parent, along with the  memory of the child's response to that parent, are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the child to continue loving a parent that he sees as completely supportive. Once dissociated, these memories of the child in relationship to the parent become internal ego structures over time. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent must be dissociated for if the child were to \"see\" this reality it would destroy his dependency relationship on the parent and he would face an abandonment crisis. In addition to the memories of the rejecting parent (The Rejecting Object in Fairbairn's model) the child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions. Fairbairn called the ego structure that develops from the dissociated memories of  the child's  self  as he reacted to the parent's rejection of him and his legitimate needs, the Antilibidinal Ego. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized rejecting object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden (2018); \n\n\" Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on.The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|chapter=Why read Fairbairn? *|date=2018-03-08|pages=131\u2013146|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8|doi=10.4324/9780429474538-12|title=Fairbairn and the Object Relations Tradition}}</ref>  \n\nWithin the child's inner world (his unconscious) the Antilibidinal Ego relates only to the \"Rejecting Object\", and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious Central Ego that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent (the Ideal Object) and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity  to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating of a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis) perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents. These rare supportive interactions are enhanced by fantasy and become a second unconscious view of the parent as loving and supportive. This potentially loving fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the Exciting Object by Fairbairn, and the child's self  that relates to it was called the Libidinal Ego (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly. the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets- the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it,  while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is  always out of reach. \n\nThese two unconscious pairs (The Antilibidinal Ego that relates to the Rejecting Object, and the Libidinal Ego that relates only to the Exciting Object) are unknown to each other and to the Central Ego. Splitting allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole Object. Thus, the individual  never develops \"object constancy\" which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved and the individual functions at an earlier stage of development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects as if they were two different people. When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  Libidinal Ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage and minutes later says \"I love you Mommy\". There is no memory of the other ego state. Equally importantly, powerful, emotional filled memories are dissociated which impoverishes, and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref>\n\n'''Fairbairn's Structural Model'''\n\nEmotional deprivation and the resulting fear of abandonment leads to splitting of the ego and the split ego eventuates into Fairbairn's s Structural Theory. As just described, the psyche is split into three pairs of selves that relate to three separate objects. The three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are unaware of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however it never develops beyond this steady state. As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious central ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's central ego through  daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop  new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with other who see aspects of himself that his parent's have not discovered. \n\nIn  less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance  is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his central ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time,  his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego is losing sight the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  The ratio of conscious to unconscious structures shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the libidinal ego seeking the key to the love that it assumes (incorrectly) is stored in their parent. This powerful unconscious influences the weakened central ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> When any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior  and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html Structural Model]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fairbairn, Ronald}}\n[[Category:1889 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:British psychoanalysts]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychologists]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychiatrists]]\n[[Category:People educated at Merchiston Castle School]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:People from Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Scottish soldiers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:Analysands of Sigmund Freud]]\n[[Category:Object relations theorists]]\n[[Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Illusion Of Love: Why The Battered Woman Returns To Her Abuser|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0231100373|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n{{psychoanalysis}}\n[[File:The Red House, Cluny Gardens.jpg|thumb|Fairbairn's birthplace - The Red House, Cluny Gardens]]\n[[File:Ronald Fairbairn's grave, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|235px|Ronald Fairbairn's grave, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh]]\n'''William Ronald Dodds Fairbairn''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|f|\u025b\u0259r|b|\u025b\u0259r|n}}) [[FRSE]] (11 August 1889 \u2013 31 December 1964) was a Scottish psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and a central figure in the development of the [[object relations theory]] of psychoanalysis.\n\n==Life==\nRonald Fairbairn was born at the Red House, Cluny Gardens,<ref>Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1889-90</ref> in [[Morningside, Edinburgh]] in 1889, the only child of Cecilia Leefe and Thomas Fairbairn, a chartered surveyor, and President of the Edinburgh Architectural Association.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40312|title=Fairbairn, (William) Ronald Dodds (1889\u20131964), psychiatrist and psychoanalyst|last=|first=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/40312}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783\u20132002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref> He was educated at [[Merchiston Castle School]] and at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he studied for three years in [[divinity]] and [[Hellenic Greek]] studies, graduating MA in 1911.\n\nIn the [[First World War]] he joined the [[Royal Engineers]] and served under [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestinian campaign]], and then the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]].\n\nOn his return to home he began medical training, probably inspired by his war experience.

The book is divided into three parts, the first being mostly theoretical, the second one clinical, and the third one concerning more general problems. The first four articles contain most of Fairbairn's innovative concepts.  Fairbairn's work was a direct challenge to Freud's model of psychoanalysis, including his theory of psychological development, the functions and dynamics of personality, the origins of psychopathology, and the treatment of disordered individuals. In short, his goal was to replace Freudian metapsychology with his own model as noted by Greenberg and Mitchell: <blockquote>In a series of dense and fertile papers written during the  early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref>.</blockquote>Freud's psychoanalytic model is a drive/structure  model  in that it  proposes that  human beings are born with innate, biological drives (sex and aggression) that are contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the context. When they come into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society there is immediate conflict. A new structure has to emerge from the Id  to insure that the drives continue to be expressed in a way permitted by society. Thus the unconscious Id, which is Freud's metaphor for the package  of the (assumed)  biological  drives, is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of the ego. This second structure has the task of mediating  between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development the child internalizes the values of his parents and these internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures; The Id, Ego and Super Ego mature, and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make the morally correct  choices.     \n\nFairbairn's model is a relational/structure model  in that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, and an not from the pressure exerted by the from the Id (which does not exist in Fairbairn's metapsychology). The human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. Internal ego structures can be understood to be packages of  memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to them. Fairbairn's structural theory develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child' developing central ego to remember.  Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy his necessary illusion that he was loves and cherished. In primitive families where punishment is frequent, the child can be overwhelmed by parental aggression and faces the loss of his sense of self, as described Bromberg in the following quote.     <blockquote>Psychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. ..At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n\n     </blockquote>Over time, these dissociated events, including those where the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process). Thus the human psyche is structured over time based on split off traumas that are unavailable to the individuals central ego. This is a very different structural model when compared to Freud's. In Fairbairn's model the  unconscious is ''developed'' (not inherited) from parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.        \n\n=== Schizoid Factors in the Personality  (1940) ===\nFairbairn's first paper introduced his observation that many of his patient's appeared to be \"schizoid\" a condition that he defined as being a direct result of having splits in their ego structure. He noted that these patients had three observable characteristics.<blockquote>These are (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality....So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn,1952, p:6-7).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref>      </blockquote>He noted that the schizoid condition was do to split off (dissociated) parts of the ego which were unknown to the conscious \"central ego\". This style of behavior was provoked by rejection of the child need for love during his developmental years. The schizoid was raised by a mother who was unable  to relate to her child  with tender, loving  emotions  and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world which is safer, but ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out in bold and uncompromising manner as the following quote illustrates.<blockquote>Regressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation  giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a bad object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that...he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (C) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious, (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18)</blockquote>Thus, Fairbairn saw that the lack of love in a young child's life was traumatic, and also caused splits in his ego. Typically, Fairbairn waited until later in his writing to inform the reader how and why certain material was deleted from the child's memory by dissociation, as the first four papers exposed his thought processes as he worked on and developed his full theory.  \n\n=== A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941) ===\nFairbairn gradually formed his model in these first four papers. He made a direct challenge to Freud's drive theory in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless,it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress,the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fairairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=31}}</ref>  Unfortunately, this shift in focus was to great for the analytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model  was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian, there were no other options, and Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From his point on, his model was seen as an interesting intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become more powerful than Libido Theory.\n\n\nHis text; Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality (1952) contained the following chapters;\n\n# Chapter I: Schizoid Factors in the Personality (1940)\t\n# Chapter II: A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses (1941)\n# Chapter III: The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (with special reference to the \u2018War Neuroses) (1943)\n# Chapter IV: Endopsychic Structure Considered in Terms of Object-Relationships (1944)\n#Chapter V: Object-Relationships and Dynamic Structure (1946)\t\n#Chapter VI: Steps in the Development of an Object-Relations Theory of the Personality1 (1949)\t\n#Chapter VII: A Synopsis of the Development of the Author's Views Regarding the Structure of the Personality (1951)\n* Part Two: Clinical Papers\t\n#Chapter I: Notes on the Religious Phantasies of a Female Patient (1927)\t\n#Chapter II: Features in the Analysis of a Patient with a Physical Genital Abnormality (1931)\t\n#Chapter III: The Effect of a King's Death Upon Patients Undergoing Analysis (1936)\t\n* Part Three: Miscellaneous Papers\n#Chapter I: The Sociological Significance of Communism Considered in the Light of Psychoanalysis (1935)\t\n#Chapter II: Psychology as a Prescribed and as a Proscribed Subject (1939)\t\n#Chapter III: The War Neuroses\u2014Their Nature and Significance (1943)\t\n#Chapter IV: The Treatment and Rehabilitation of Sexual Offenders (1946)\n\n==Innovative concepts==\n\n===The object-seeking libido===\nOne of the most important contributions of Fairbairn to the psychoanalytic paradigm is proposing an alternative viewpoint regarding the libido. Whereas [[Freud]] assumed that the [[libido]] is pleasure seeking, Fairbairn thought of the libido as object seeking.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Peter Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Peter | title=Introduction to \"Psychoanalysis and after\" | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fairbairn|first=W.

The first connections a child makes are with his parents. Through diverse forms of contact between the child and his parents, a bond between them is formed. When the bond is formed, the child becomes strongly attached to his parents. This early relationship shapes the emotional life of the child in such a strong way that it determines the emotional experiences that the child will have later on in life, because the early libidinal objects become the prototypes for all later experience of connection with others.\n\n===Internal object relations===\nFairbairn states that the [[object relations]] a child has very early on in life become the child's prototypes for all later experiences regarding connections with others. The internal [[object relations|object relation]] describes a relation which exists in the person's mind. In the normal situation, healthy parenting results in a child with an outward orientation towards real people, who can give real contact and exchange. When the needs of the child are not met by the parents (e.g. [[dependency need]]s and the need for affirmative interactions) a pathological turning away from external reality takes place. Instead of actual exchange with others, fantasised, private presences are established, the so-called internal objects. To these internal objects the child relates in fantasised connections, the internal object relations.\n\n===The splitting of the ego===\n{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}\nFairbairn recognized that  children are  totally and absolutely dependent on their parents. Because of this dependency they cannot tolerate \"knowing\" that their parents are indifferent, abandoning, and perhaps even abusive. They solve the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. The defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn had worked in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>as one of his part-time appointments and his experiences with children separated from their families alerted him to the reality that the child's extreme dependency on their parents makes any abandonment a major trauma. The powerful defense called dissociation was needed to erase the event from their consciousness. The memory of the rejecting parent, along with the  memory of the child's response to that parent, are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the child to continue loving a parent that he sees as completely supportive. Once dissociated, these memories of the child in relationship to the parent become internal ego structures over time. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent must be dissociated for if the child were to \"see\" this reality it would destroy his dependency relationship on the parent and he would face an abandonment crisis. In addition to the memories of the rejecting parent (The Rejecting Object in Fairbairn's model) the child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions. Fairbairn called the ego structure that develops from the dissociated memories of  the child's  self  as he reacted to the parent's rejection of him and his legitimate needs, the Antilibidinal Ego. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized rejecting object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden (2018); \n\n\" Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on.The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|chapter=Why read Fairbairn? *|date=2018-03-08|pages=131\u2013146|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8|doi=10.4324/9780429474538-12|title=Fairbairn and the Object Relations Tradition}}</ref>  \n\nWithin the child's inner world (his unconscious) the Antilibidinal Ego relates only to the \"Rejecting Object\", and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious Central Ego that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent (the Ideal Object) and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity  to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating of a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis) perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents. These rare supportive interactions are enhanced by fantasy and become a second unconscious view of the parent as loving and supportive. This potentially loving fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the Exciting Object by Fairbairn, and the child's self  that relates to it was called the Libidinal Ego (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly. the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets- the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it,  while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is  always out of reach. \n\nThese two unconscious pairs (The Antilibidinal Ego that relates to the Rejecting Object, and the Libidinal Ego that relates only to the Exciting Object) are unknown to each other and to the Central Ego. Splitting allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole Object. Thus, the individual  never develops \"object constancy\" which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved and the individual functions at an earlier stage of development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects as if they were two different people. When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  Libidinal Ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage and minutes later says \"I love you Mommy\". There is no memory of the other ego state. Equally importantly, powerful, emotional filled memories are dissociated which impoverishes, and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref>\n\n'''Fairbairn's Structural Model'''\n\nEmotional deprivation and the resulting fear of abandonment leads to splitting of the ego and the split ego eventuates into Fairbairn's s Structural Theory. As just described, the psyche is split into three pairs of selves that relate to three separate objects. The three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are unaware of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however it never develops beyond this steady state. As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious central ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's central ego through  daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop  new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with other who see aspects of himself that his parent's have not discovered. \n\nIn  less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance  is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his central ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time,  his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego is losing sight the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  The ratio of conscious to unconscious structures shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the libidinal ego seeking the key to the love that it assumes (incorrectly) is stored in their parent. This powerful unconscious influences the weakened central ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> When any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior  and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html Structural Model]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fairbairn, Ronald}}\n[[Category:1889 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:British psychoanalysts]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychologists]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychiatrists]]\n[[Category:People educated at Merchiston Castle School]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:People from Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Scottish soldiers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:Analysands of Sigmund Freud]]\n[[Category:Object relations theorists]]\n[[Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "David Celani", "label": "safe", "comment": "I added a section on Fairbairn's 1941 paper and removed the table of contents of his (19520 book, which added nothing to the discussion of his model", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fairbairn"}

It was formed in October&nbsp;1944 at [[Tilburg]], with the original 1st&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Personnel Carrier Squadron as its core. It was the only Canadian regiment to be both formed and disbanded overseas. The new regiment's purpose was to serve as a specialized armoured unit equipped with modified tanks used to carry infantry safely to their objectives. The concept of such [[armoured personnel carriers]] was an entirely new innovation, and it was through the 1CACR's efforts that their effectiveness was proven, revolutionizing the tactical handling of infantry in battle.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=x}}\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:IWM-BU-2956-Ram-Kangaroo-Ochtrup-19450403.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Infantry of the [[53rd (Welsh) Division]] in a Ram Kangaroo on the outskirts of [[Ochtrup]], Germany, 3&nbsp;April 1945]]\n\nThe decision to convert redundant tanks into personnel carriers was inspired by Allied experiences during the [[D-Day]] landings, where British and Canadian forces experienced much lower casualty rates by leading attacks on German lines with armour than did the Americans, who led with an infantry assault.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|pp=1\u20132}} To General [[Guy Simonds]], who was ordered to follow up the D-Day attacks with an assault on Falaise, this experience suggested both the usefulness of such armour-first tactics, as well as the further benefits of using armoured vehicles to transport troops, leading him to stress the issue while planning his assault, deeming it essential \"...that the infantry must be carried in bullet-proof and splinter-proof vehicles to the actual objectives.\"{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=2}} No such vehicles existed at that time, and this idea thus marked the advent of what are now called armoured personnel carriers. Carriers were made on the spot from extra [[M7 Priest]] {{cvt|105|mm}} self-propelled guns by removing the guns and welding steel plates across the gaps this left in the armour.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=3}} These modified tanks were entitled \"[[Kangaroo (armoured personnel carrier)|Kangaroos]]\" partially after the codename of the Army Workshops Detachment that produced them, and partially because of the idea that infantry would be carried in the belly of the tank as safely as a young kangaroo in its mother's pouch.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=2}}\n\nThe order to convert 72&nbsp;Priests into carriers by the commencement of [[Operation Totalize]] on August&nbsp;9 was given on July&nbsp;31 by Brigadier C. M. Grant, the Deputy Director of Mechanical Engineering at Headquarters.{{sfn|Grodzinski|1995|pp=43\u201350}} Ultimately, 78 would be converted prior to the first engagement, in spite of the fact that the operation's start date had been advanced to August&nbsp;7\u2014an impressive feat, as just one part of the conversion process was generally a seven-day operation.{{sfn|Grodzinski|1995|p=43}} The drivers for the new vehicles were swiftly and secretly recruited from the Armoured Corps reinforcements, artillery units, and the [[Elgin Regiment (RCAC)|Elgin Regiment]], and were rushed into service with almost no training, first seeing action during the attack on [[Falaise pocket|Falaise]] on the night of August 7\u20138, 1944.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=4}}\n\nThe attack on Falaise was carried out successfully, resulting in the capture of 200&nbsp;tanks, 60&nbsp;assault guns, 250&nbsp;towed guns, and 2500&nbsp;motored vehicles from the Germans, as well as an unhindered six-day advance.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=8}}  The lead brigades of the assault had all been carried in the new Kangaroos, allowing them to move swiftly and providing the following results regarding the comparative casualties of the seven Canadian infantry battalions involved:{{sfn|Grodzinski|1995|pp=44\u201345}}\n::::::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Mounted || [[The Royal Regiment of Canada]] || 3 killed || 25 wounded\n|-\n|  || [[The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry]] || 1 killed || 14 wounded\n|-\n|  || [[The Essex Scottish Regiment]] || 3 killed || 7 wounded\n|-\n| Marching || [[The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada]] || 30 killed || 96 wounded\n|-\n|  || [[Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal]] || 8 killed || 17 wounded\n|-\n|  || [[The South Saskatchewan Regiment]] || 16 killed || 42 wounded\n|-\n|  || [[The Calgary Highlanders]] || 14 killed || 37 wounded\n|}\nImpressed by the carriers' performance, General Simonds began petitioning for the formation of a permanent carrier unit.\n\n==Formation==\nOn August&nbsp;28, 1944, General Simonds' requests were granted, and the 1st&nbsp;Armoured Carrier Squadron was formed. The unit was established as four troops of 25&nbsp;carriers (though only 55&nbsp;vehicles were then available), with personnel consisting of one commanding officer, four troop commanders, and 100&nbsp;drivers, and was attached to the 25th&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Delivery Regiment (The Elgin Regiment) for administrative purposes.{{sfn|Grodzinski|1995|p=45}} When engaged in an operation, it would come \"under command of various Infantry Brigades in turn.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1945}} Each carrier had a .50-inch Browning machine gun, and approximately 60% of the vehicles were equipped with radios, however, there was no co-driver to fire the gun or operate the wireless set.{{sfn|Churchill|1945}}\n\nAfter several months of operation, 21st&nbsp;Army Group concluded that the 1st&nbsp;Armoured Carrier Squadron was the best means to seize objectives and reduce infantry casualties, leading to their decision to form two armoured personnel carrier regiments\u2014the British [[49th Armoured Personnel Carrier Regiment]], and the 1st&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Personnel Carrier Regiment, both of which would belong to the [[79th&nbsp;Armoured Division]], with the 1CAPCR serving as the only Canadian regiment in the division.{{sfn|Grodzinski|1995|p=46}} Official recognition of the change was delivered via the following proclamation:\n:: \"By authority of the GOC First Canadian Army, 19 October 1944, the 1st Canadian Armoured Personnel Carrier Squadron ceased to exist as a separate entity and became a squadron of the newly-created I Canadian Armoured Personnel Carrier Regiment.

Churchill, formerly 25th Canadian Armoured Delivery Regiment (Elgin Regiment) and 10 Canadian Armoured Regiment (Fort Garry Horse) with Major F.K. Bingham, Sherbrooke Fusiliers and First Hussars as Second-in-Command. Regimental Headquarters to be at 83 Van Ryswich St., Antwerp.\"{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=19}}\n\nDue to the inclusion of the 1CAPCR in the 79th, known for its wide array of speciality vehicles, the regiment was also included in the 79th's classification as a secret operation\u2014a principal reason for the scarcity of information regarding its activities.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=ix}}\n\nAfter further petitioning on the part of Lieutenant Colonel Churchill, the regiment was given its final title of the 1st&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Carrier Regiment on January&nbsp;1, 1945.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=45}} The regiment was both formed and ultimately disbanded in the Netherlands, without attachment to any regimental home, city, or province, and its personnel were drawn from all over Canada. In spite of its lack of a personal history, however, the regiment's high degree of success quickly moulded them into a cohesive unit of high morale.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=x}}\n\n==Disbandment==\nThe secret, foreign-born Canadian regiment that few would ever hear of ended its short history in the Canadian Army as of 11:59pm (2359 hours) on June&nbsp;20, 1945.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=186}}\n\n==Battle honours==\nIn spite of their brief existence, the Kangaroos were granted the right to display the following battle honours:{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=198}}\n\n::*The [[Meuse|Lower Maas]]\n::*The [[Roer]]\n::*The [[Rhineland]]\n::*[[Klever Reichswald|The Reichswald]]\n::*Moyland Wood\n::*[[Goch]]-Calcar Road\n::*[[Operation Blockbuster|The Hochwald]]\n::*The [[Rhine]]\n::*[[Groningen]]\n::*North-West Europe, 1944\u20131945\n::*[[Le Havre]]\n::*[[Boulogne]], 1944\n::*[[Xanten]]\n\nThe presentation of their regimental (replica) [[Guidon (heraldic flag)|guidon]]  was finally presented on September 10, 2011, at a drum head ceremony at the Elgin Regiment Armoury, [[St. Thomas, Ontario]], Canada.

The removal of the turret, turret basket, and master gun produced an ideal low profiled, lighter weight carrier with low track pressure that allowed for superior manoeuvrability on soft ground. The addition of two .30-inch Browning machine guns also transformed the Rams into mobile machine gun nests, allowing them to force the enemy to keep their heads down until the transported infantry could debark. On occasion, by the time the Rams made it into position they found the enemy already ready to surrender without further engagement.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|pp=15\u201316}}  Each carrier could hold 11&nbsp;infantry and a two-man crew.{{sfn|Grodzinski|1995|p=46}}\n\n==Attached organizations==\nThe 123&nbsp;Light Aid Detachment (LAD), [[Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]], under the command of Captain E.

It was formed in October&nbsp;1944 at [[Tilburg]], with the original 1st&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Personnel Carrier Squadron as its core. It was the only Canadian regiment to be both formed and disbanded overseas. The new regiment's purpose was to serve as a specialized armoured unit equipped with modified tanks used to carry infantry safely to their objectives. The concept of such [[armoured personnel carriers]] was an entirely new innovation, and it was through the 1CACR's efforts that their effectiveness was proven, revolutionizing the tactical handling of infantry in battle.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=x}}\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:IWM-BU-2956-Ram-Kangaroo-Ochtrup-19450403.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Infantry of the [[53rd (Welsh) Division]] in a Ram Kangaroo on the outskirts of [[Ochtrup]], Germany, 3&nbsp;April 1945]]\n\nThe decision to convert redundant tanks into personnel carriers was inspired by Allied experiences during the [[D-Day]] landings, where British and Canadian forces experienced much lower casualty rates by leading attacks on German lines with armour than did the Americans, who led with an infantry assault.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|pp=1\u20132}} To General [[Guy Simonds]], who was ordered to follow up the D-Day attacks with an assault on Falaise, this experience suggested both the usefulness of such armour-first tactics, as well as the further benefits of using armoured vehicles to transport troops, leading him to stress the issue while planning his assault, deeming it essential \"...that the infantry must be carried in bullet-proof and splinter-proof vehicles to the actual objectives.\"{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=2}} No such vehicles existed at that time, and this idea thus marked the advent of what are now called armoured personnel carriers. Carriers were made on the spot from extra [[M7 Priest]] {{cvt|105|mm}} self-propelled guns by removing the guns and welding steel plates across the gaps this left in the armour.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=3}} These modified tanks were entitled \"[[Kangaroo (armoured personnel carrier)|Kangaroos]]\" partially after the codename of the Army Workshops Detachment that produced them, and partially because of the idea that infantry would be carried in the belly of the tank as safely as a young kangaroo in its mother's pouch.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=2}}\n\nThe order to convert 72&nbsp;Priests into carriers by the commencement of [[Operation Totalize]] on August&nbsp;9 was given on July&nbsp;31 by Brigadier C. M. Grant, the Deputy Director of Mechanical Engineering at Headquarters.{{sfn|Grodzinski|1995|pp=43\u201350}} Ultimately, 78 would be converted prior to the first engagement, in spite of the fact that the operation's start date had been advanced to August&nbsp;7\u2014an impressive feat, as just one part of the conversion process was generally a seven-day operation.{{sfn|Grodzinski|1995|p=43}} The drivers for the new vehicles were swiftly and secretly recruited from the Armoured Corps reinforcements, artillery units, and the [[Elgin Regiment (RCAC)|Elgin Regiment]], and were rushed into service with almost no training, first seeing action during the attack on [[Falaise pocket|Falaise]] on the night of August 7\u20138, 1944.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=4}}\n\nThe attack on Falaise was carried out successfully, resulting in the capture of 200&nbsp;tanks, 60&nbsp;assault guns, 250&nbsp;towed guns, and 2500&nbsp;motored vehicles from the Germans, as well as an unhindered six-day advance.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=8}}  The lead brigades of the assault had all been carried in the new Kangaroos, allowing them to move swiftly and providing the following results regarding the comparative casualties of the seven Canadian infantry battalions involved:{{sfn|Grodzinski|1995|pp=44\u201345}}\n::::::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Mounted || [[The Royal Regiment of Canada]] || 3 killed || 25 wounded\n|-\n|  || [[The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry]] || 1 killed || 14 wounded\n|-\n|  || [[The Essex Scottish Regiment]] || 3 killed || 7 wounded\n|-\n| Marching || [[The Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada]] || 30 killed || 96 wounded\n|-\n|  || [[Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal]] || 8 killed || 17 wounded\n|-\n|  || [[The South Saskatchewan Regiment]] || 16 killed || 42 wounded\n|-\n|  || [[The Calgary Highlanders]] || 14 killed || 37 wounded\n|}\nImpressed by the carriers' performance, General Simonds began petitioning for the formation of a permanent carrier unit.\n\n==Formation==\nOn August&nbsp;28, 1944, General Simonds' requests were granted, and the 1st&nbsp;Armoured Carrier Squadron was formed. The unit was established as four troops of 25&nbsp;carriers (though only 55&nbsp;vehicles were then available), with personnel consisting of one commanding officer, four troop commanders, and 100&nbsp;drivers, and was attached to the 25th&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Delivery Regiment (The Elgin Regiment) for administrative purposes.{{sfn|Grodzinski|1995|p=45}} When engaged in an operation, it would come \"under command of various Infantry Brigades in turn.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1945}} Each carrier had a .50-inch Browning machine gun, and approximately 60% of the vehicles were equipped with radios, however, there was no co-driver to fire the gun or operate the wireless set.{{sfn|Churchill|1945}}\n\nAfter several months of operation, 21st&nbsp;Army Group concluded that the 1st&nbsp;Armoured Carrier Squadron was the best means to seize objectives and reduce infantry casualties, leading to their decision to form two armoured personnel carrier regiments\u2014the British [[49th Armoured Personnel Carrier Regiment]], and the 1st&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Personnel Carrier Regiment, both of which would belong to the [[79th&nbsp;Armoured Division]], with the 1CAPCR serving as the only Canadian regiment in the division.{{sfn|Grodzinski|1995|p=46}} Official recognition of the change was delivered via the following proclamation:\n:: \"By authority of the GOC First Canadian Army, 19 October 1944, the 1st Canadian Armoured Personnel Carrier Squadron ceased to exist as a separate entity and became a squadron of the newly-created I Canadian Armoured Personnel Carrier Regiment. The Regiment to be commanded by Lieut. Col. Gordon M. Churchill, formerly 25th Canadian Armoured Delivery Regiment (Elgin Regiment) and 10 Canadian Armoured Regiment (Fort Garry Horse) with Major F.K. Bingham, Sherbrooke Fusiliers and First Hussars as Second-in-Command. Regimental Headquarters to be at 83 Van Ryswich St., Antwerp.\"{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=19}}\n\nDue to the inclusion of the 1CAPCR in the 79th, known for its wide array of speciality vehicles, the regiment was also included in the 79th's classification as a secret operation\u2014a principal reason for the scarcity of information regarding its activities.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=ix}}\n\nAfter further petitioning on the part of Lieutenant Colonel Churchill, the regiment was given its final title of the 1st&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Carrier Regiment on January&nbsp;1, 1945.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=45}} The regiment was both formed and ultimately disbanded in the Netherlands, without attachment to any regimental home, city, or province, and its personnel were drawn from all over Canada. In spite of its lack of a personal history, however, the regiment's high degree of success quickly moulded them into a cohesive unit of high morale.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=x}}\n\n==Disbandment==\nThe secret, foreign-born Canadian regiment that few would ever hear of ended its short history in the Canadian Army as of 11:59pm (2359 hours) on June&nbsp;20, 1945.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=186}}\n\n==Battle honours==\nIn spite of their brief existence, the Kangaroos were granted the right to display the following battle honours:{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|p=198}}\n\n::*The [[Meuse|Lower Maas]]\n::*The [[Roer]]\n::*The [[Rhineland]]\n::*[[Klever Reichswald|The Reichswald]]\n::*Moyland Wood\n::*[[Goch]]-Calcar Road\n::*[[Operation Blockbuster|The Hochwald]]\n::*The [[Rhine]]\n::*[[Groningen]]\n::*North-West Europe, 1944\u20131945\n::*[[Le Havre]]\n::*[[Boulogne]], 1944\n::*[[Xanten]]\n\nThe presentation of their regimental (replica) [[Guidon (heraldic flag)|guidon]]  was finally presented on September 10, 2011, at a drum head ceremony at the Elgin Regiment Armoury, [[St. Thomas, Ontario]], Canada. The guidon shows these battle honours:\n\n::*Le Havre\n::*The Roer\n::*The Rhineland\n::*The Reichswald\n::*Cleve\n::*Goch-Calcar Road\n::*The Hochwald\n::*The Rhine\n::*Groningen\n::*North-West Europe, 1944\u20131945\n\n==Equipment==\n[[Image:IWM-NA-24043-Priest-Kangaroo-Conselice-19450413.jpg|300px|thumb|A Priest Kangaroo in Italy, April 1945]]\n*Modified US 105mm [[M7 Priest]] Self-Propelling Guns: \"modifications included the removal of the 105 mm gun, mount and [[Mantlet|mantelet]] (which led to the sobriquet \"defrocked Priests,\" later replaced by \"Kangaroos\"), overhauling the radial engine, checking the serviceability of the transmission and the controlled differential brake lining and running gear. \u2026 Armour plate was placed over the gun mantelet opening and added to the vehicle sides.\"{{sfn|Grodzinski|1995|p=43}}\n*Modified [[Ram Tank]]: The Canadian-designed and built Ram was largely considered a failure as a tank, being both underpowered and undergunned, but proved easy to modify into a superior personnel carrier. The removal of the turret, turret basket, and master gun produced an ideal low profiled, lighter weight carrier with low track pressure that allowed for superior manoeuvrability on soft ground. The addition of two .30-inch Browning machine guns also transformed the Rams into mobile machine gun nests, allowing them to force the enemy to keep their heads down until the transported infantry could debark. On occasion, by the time the Rams made it into position they found the enemy already ready to surrender without further engagement.{{sfn|Ramsden|1997|pp=15\u201316}}  Each carrier could hold 11&nbsp;infantry and a two-man crew.{{sfn|Grodzinski|1995|p=46}}\n\n==Attached organizations==\nThe 123&nbsp;Light Aid Detachment, (LAD) [[Royal Canadian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]], under the command of Captain E.

Meanwhile, [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] center on details of the individual survivors' lives prior to the plane crash.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{Main|Lost (season 2)}}\nSeason 2 follows the growing conflict between the survivors and the Others and continues the theme of the clash between faith and science, while resolving old mysteries and posing new ones. The four survivors in the raft are ambushed by the Others, and they take [[Walt Lloyd|Walt]], [[Michael Dawson (Lost)|Michael]]'s son. The survivors are forced to return to the island, where they find the tail-section survivors (the \"Tailies\"). A power struggle between Jack and [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]] over control of the guns and medicine located in the hatch develops, resolved in \"[[The Long Con]]\" by [[James \"Sawyer\" Ford|Sawyer]] when he gains control of them. The hatch is revealed to be a research station built some thirty years earlier by the [[Dharma Initiative]], a scientific research project that involved conducting experiments on the island. A man named [[Desmond Hume]] had been living in the hatch for three years, activating a computer program every 108 minutes to prevent an unknown catastrophic event from occurring. To recover his son, Michael betrays the survivors, and Jack, Sawyer, and [[Kate Austen|Kate]] are captured. Michael is given a boat and leaves the island with his son, while John destroys the computer in the hatch, whereupon an electromagnetic event shakes the island. This causes the island to be detected by scientists working for [[Penelope Widmore]], and it is revealed that it was a similar event that caused the breakup of the plane.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{Main|Lost (season 3)}}\nIn Season 3, the crash survivors learn more about the Others and their long history on the mysterious island, along with the fate of the Dharma Initiative. The leader of the Others, [[Benjamin Linus]], is introduced as well and defections from both sides pave the way for conflict between the two. [[Time travel]] elements also begin to appear in the series, as Desmond is forced to turn the fail-safe key in the hatch to stop the electromagnetic event, and this sends his mind eight years to the past. When he returns to the present, he is able to see the future. Kate and Sawyer escape the Others, while Jack stays after Ben promises that Jack will be able to leave the island in a submarine if he operates on Ben, who has cancer. Jack does, but the submarine is destroyed by John. Jack is left behind with [[Juliet Burke|Juliet]], an Other, who also seeks to leave the island, while John joins the Others. A helicopter carrying Naomi crashes near the island. Naomi says her freighter, ''Kahana'', is near and was sent by [[Penelope Widmore]], Desmond's ex-girlfriend. Desmond has a vision in which [[Charlie Pace|Charlie]] will drown after shutting down a signal that prevents communication with the exterior world. His vision comes true, but Charlie speaks with Penelope, who says she does not know any Naomi. Before drowning, Charlie writes on his hand \"Not Penny's Boat\" so Desmond can read it. Meanwhile, the survivors make contact with a rescue team aboard the freighter. In the [[Through the Looking Glass (Lost)|season's finale]], apparent flashbacks show a depressed Jack going to an unknown person's funeral. In the final scene, these are revealed to be \"flash forwards\", and Kate and Jack are revealed to have escaped the island. Jack, however, is desperate to go back.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{Main|Lost (season 4)}}\nSeason 4 focuses on the survivors dealing with the arrival of people from the freighter, who have been sent to the island to reclaim it from Benjamin. \"Flash forwards\" continue, in which it is seen how six survivors, dubbed the \"Oceanic Six\", live their lives after escaping the island. The \"Oceanic Six\" are Jack, Kate, Hurley, Sayid, Sun, and Aaron. In the present, four members of the freighter arrive and team up with the survivors to escape the island, since the people of the freighter have orders to kill everyone who stays.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben travels with John to see [[Jacob (Lost)|Jacob]], the island's leader. John enters his house but finds Jack's dead father, [[Christian Shephard|Christian]], who says he can speak on Jacob's behalf, and orders John to \"move\" the island. Ben takes John to an underground station in which time travel was researched. John becomes the new leader of the Others, while Ben moves the island by turning a giant frozen wheel, after which he is transported to the [[Sahara]]. The six survivors escape in a helicopter as they watch the island disappear and are subsequently rescued by Penelope.\n\nIn the season finale, it is revealed that the funeral Jack went to in the \"flash forwards\" was that of John Locke, who had been seeking out the Oceanic Six in his efforts to convince them to return to the island.\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{Main|Lost (season 5)}}\nSeason 5 follows two timelines. The first timeline takes place on the island where the survivors who were left behind erratically jump forward and backward through time. In one of these time periods, John speaks with [[Richard Alpert (Lost)|Richard Alpert]], one of the Others, who says that to save the island, he must bring everyone back. John goes to the same underground station Ben went to. After moving the wheel himself, John is transported to the Sahara in 2007, as the time shifts on the island stop and the survivors are stranded with the [[Dharma Initiative]] in 1974. In 2007, John contacts the Oceanic Six, but no one wants to return. The last one of the Oceanic Six he finds is a depressed Jack. John tells Jack his father is alive on the island. This seriously affects Jack, and he begins taking flights, hoping to crash on the island again. Ben finds John and kills him. After John's death, the Oceanic Six are told to board the Ajira Airways Flight 316 to return to the island and in order to go back, they have to take John Locke's body in the plane. They take the flight, but some land in 1977, where they meet with the other survivors who are now part of the Dharma Initiative, and others land in 2007. The survivors in 1977 are told by [[Daniel Faraday]] that if they detonate a nuclear bomb at the hatch's construction site, the electromagnetic energy below it will be negated, and, thus, the hatch would never be built and, thus, their future could be changed. In 2007, John Locke apparently comes back to life. He instructs Richard Alpert to speak with a time-traveling John and tell him that he must bring everyone back to the island. After this, he goes to speak with Jacob. The season finale reveals that John Locke is still dead and another entity has taken over his form just to make Ben kill Jacob. In 1977, Juliet detonates the fission core taken from the hydrogen bomb.\n\n=== Season 6 ===\n{{Main|Lost (season 6)}}\nSeason 6, the final season, follows two timelines. In the first timeline, the survivors are sent to the present day, as the death of Jacob allows for his brother, the [[Man in Black (Lost)|Man in Black]], the human alter-ego of the [[Mythology of Lost#The Man in Black/The Monster|Smoke Monster]], to take over the island. Having assumed the form of John Locke, the Smoke Monster seeks to escape the island and forces a final war between the forces of good and evil.\n\nThe second timeline, called the \"flash-sideways\" narrative, follows the lives of the main characters in a setting where Oceanic 815 never crashed, though additional changes are revealed as other characters are shown living completely different lives than they did. In the final episodes, a [[Across the Sea (Lost)|flashback to the distant past]] shows the origins of the island's power and of the conflict between Jacob and the Man in Black, who are revealed to be twin brothers, with Jacob desperate to keep his brother from leaving the island after he is [[transmogrified]] by the power of the island and becomes the Smoke Monster.\n\nIn this season, Jacob's machinations are revealed: everyone was pushed by fate and his manipulation to be on the Oceanic flight as many of the members of the flight were deemed \"candidates\" by Jacob to be the new protector of the island after his passing. The Man in Black's mission since the beginning of the series: kill all of the candidates, thereby allowing him to leave the island once and for all. The ghost of Jacob appears to the last-of-the-surviving candidates, and Jack is appointed as the new protector. Jack catches up with The Man In Black, who says that he wants to go to the \"heart of the island\" to turn it off and, therefore, finally leave the island. They reach the place, but after doing this, The Man In Black becomes mortal. The Man In Black is killed by Kate, but Jack is seriously injured. [[Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes|Hurley]], one of the survivors, becomes the new caretaker of the island. Several of the survivors die in the conflict or stay on the island, and the remaining escape in the Ajira Plane once and for all. Jack returns to the \"heart of the island\" and turns it on again, saving it. Hurley, as the new protector, asks Ben to help him in his new job, which he agrees to do. After having saved the island, Jack dies peacefully in the same place in which he woke up when he arrived on the island.\n\nThe [[The End (Lost)|series finale]] reveals that the flash-sideways timeline is actually a form of [[limbo]] in the afterlife, where some of the survivors and other characters from the island are reunited after having died. In the last scene, the survivors are all reunited in a church where they \"move on\" together.\n\n=== Mythology and interpretations ===\n{{Main|Mythology of Lost}}\n<!--This is a general summary only; the specific references should go to the main Mythology article.-->\nEpisodes of ''Lost'' include a number of mysterious elements ascribed to science fiction or supernatural phenomena.

[[Cindy Chandler (Lost)|Cindy]] ([[Kimberley Joseph]]), an Oceanic flight attendant who first appeared in the pilot, survived the crash and, subsequently, became one of the Others.

Desmond is in love with Widmore's daughter [[Characters of Lost#Penelope \"Penny\" Widmore|Penelope \"Penny\" Widmore]] ([[Sonya Walger]]).

The main character Jack was originally going to die in the pilot, and the role was planned for [[Michael Keaton]]. However, ABC executives were adamant that Jack live.<ref name=\"DVD\">{{cite video | title = Before They Were Lost | medium = Documentary | location = ''Lost: The Complete First Season'' | publisher = [[Buena Vista Distribution|Buena Vista Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> Before it was decided that Jack would live, Kate was to emerge as the leader of the survivors; she was originally conceived as a middle-aged businesswoman whose husband had apparently died in the crash, a role later fulfilled by the recurring character Rose. Dominic Monaghan auditioned for the role of Sawyer, who at the time was supposed to be a slick suit-wearing city con man. The producers enjoyed Monaghan's performance and changed the character of Charlie, originally an over-the-hill former rock star, to fit him. Jorge Garcia also auditioned for Sawyer, and the part of Hurley was written for him. When Josh Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked the edge he brought to the character (he reportedly kicked a chair when he forgot his lines and got angry in the audition) and his [[Southern American English|southern accent]], so they changed Sawyer to fit Holloway's acting. Yunjin Kim auditioned for Kate, but the producers wrote the character of Sun for her and the character of Jin, portrayed by Daniel Dae Kim, to be her husband. Sayid, played by Naveen Andrews, was also not in the original script. Locke and Michael were written with their actors in mind. Emilie de Ravin, who played Claire, was originally cast in what was supposed to be a recurring role.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> In the second season, Michael Emerson was contracted to play Ben (\"Henry Gale\") for three episodes. His role was extended to eight episodes because of his acting skills and eventually, for the whole of season three and later seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/tv/michael-emerson-takes-charge-of-others-in-3rd-season-of-lost-453117/ |author=Song, Jaymes |title=Michael Emerson takes charge of Others in 3rd season of 'Lost' |publisher=The Associated Press |date=October 3, 2006 |accessdate=March 21, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729215525/http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/tv/michael-emerson-takes-charge-of-others-in-3rd-season-of-lost-453117/ |archivedate=July 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Jack Bender by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|alt=Jack Bender sitting at a microphone.|Jack Bender directed the most episodes of the series and also served as an executive producer.]]\n''Lost'' was filmed on [[Panavision]] [[35mm format|35 mm]] cameras almost entirely on the Hawaiian island of [[Oahu]] given the easily accessible, wide diversity of filming locations.

A final soundtrack, featuring music from series finale, was released on October 11, 2010.\n\nThe series uses pop culture songs sparingly, and has a mainly orchestral score (consisting usually of divided strings, percussion, harp, and three trombones). When it features pop songs, they often originate from a [[Source cue|diegetic]] source. Examples include the various songs played on Hurley's portable CD player throughout the first season (until its batteries died in the episode \"[[...In Translation]]\", which featured Damien Rice's \"Delicate\") or the use of the record player in the second season, which included [[Cass Elliot]]'s \"[[Make Your Own Kind of Music (song)|Make Your Own Kind of Music]]\" and [[Petula Clark]]'s \"[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]\" in the second and third-season premieres respectively. Two episodes show Charlie on a street corner playing guitar and singing the [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] song \"[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]\". In the third season's finale, Jack drives down the street listening to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"Scentless Apprentice\", right before he arrives to the Hoffs/Drawlar Funeral Parlor, and in the parallel scene in the fourth season's finale, he arrives listening to \"[[Gouge Away]]\" by [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]]. The third season also used [[Three Dog Night]]'s \"[[Shambala (song)|Shambala]]\" on two occasions in the van. The only two pop songs that have ever been used without an on-screen source (i.e., non-[[diegetic]]) are [[Ann-Margret]]'s \"Slowly\", in the episode \"[[I Do (Lost)|I Do]]\" and \"I Shall Not Walk Alone\", written by [[Ben Harper]] and covered by [[The Blind Boys of Alabama]] in the episode \"[[Confidence Man (Lost)|Confidence Man]].\" Alternate music is used in several international broadcasts. For example, in the Japanese broadcast of ''Lost'', the [[Theme music|theme song]] used varies by season: season one uses \"Here I Am\" by [[Chemistry (band)|Chemistry]], season two uses \"[[Losin']]\" by [[Yuna Ito]], and season three uses \"Lonely Girl\" by [[Crystal Kay]].\n\n== Reception and impact ==\n=== Critical reception ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; text-align:center; margin:10px\"\n|+ [[Rotten Tomatoes]] ratings per season<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/lost|title=Lost|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=September 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{Graph:Chart\n| width = 400\n| height = 200\n| type = line\n| x = 1,2,3,4,5,6\n| y = 93,100,83,93,90,82\n| xAxisMin = 1\n| xAxisMax = 6\n| xType = string\n| yAxisMin = 50\n| yAxisMax = 100\n| xAxisTitle = Season\n| yAxisTitle = Rating\n| showSymbols = true\n}}\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|\n! scope=col | {{small|[[Lost (season 1)|Season 1]]}}\n! scope=col | {{small|[[Lost (season 2)|Season 2]]}}\n! scope=col | {{small|[[Lost (season 3)|Season 3]]}}\n! scope=col | {{small|[[Lost (season 4)|Season 4]]}}\n! scope=col | {{small|[[Lost (season 5)|Season 5]]}}\n! scope=col | {{small|[[Lost (season 6)|Season 6]]}}\n|-\n! scope=row | Rating\n| 93%\n| 100%\n| 83%\n| 93%\n| 90%\n| 82%\n|}\n|}\n\n''Lost'' has been described by numerous critics as being among the greatest television series of all time.<ref name=\"Time 100\">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2007/09/06/the-100-best-tv-shows-of-all-time/slide/lost-2/ |title=The 100 Best TV Shows of All-''TIME'' |first=James |last=Poniewozik |authorlink=James Poniewozik |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 6, 2007 |accessdate=October 23, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022172014/http://entertainment.time.com/2007/09/06/the-100-best-tv-shows-of-all-time/slide/lost-2/ |archivedate=October 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://empireonline.com/50greatesttv/default.asp?tv=5 |title=Empire: Features |work=Empire |date=December 5, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106185602/http://www.empireonline.com/50greatesttv/default.asp?tv=5 |archivedate=January 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=The New Classics: TV |url=https://ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207339,00.html |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=June 18, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020093840/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C20207339%2C00.html |archivedate=October 20, 2012}}</ref> Bill Carter, television reporter of ''[[The New York Times]]'', defined ''Lost'' as \"the show with perhaps the most compelling continuing story line in television history.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Carter |first=Bill |title=Tropical Teaser: 'Lost' Clues Decoded |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/arts/television/30lost.html |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 30, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209072605/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/arts/television/30lost.html |archivedate=December 9, 2013}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' put the show on its end-of-the-decade, \"best-of\" list, saying, \"Name another network drama that can so wondrously turn a ? into a !\"<ref>Geier, Thom; Jensen, Jeff; Jordan, Tina; Lyons, Margaret; Markovitz, Adam; Nashawaty, Chris; Pastorek, Whitney; Rice, Lynette; Rottenberg, Josh; Schwartz, Missy; Slezak, Michael; Snierson, Dan; Stack, Tim; Stroup, Kate; Tucker, Ken; Vary, Adam B.; Vozick-Levinson, Simon; Ward, Kate (December 11, 2009), \"THE 100 Greatest MOVIES, TV SHOWS, ALBUMS, BOOKS, CHARACTERS, SCENES, EPISODES, SONGS, DRESSES, MUSIC VIDEOS, AND TRENDS THAT ENTERTAINED US OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS.\" Entertainment Weekly.

''Finding Lost: The Unofficial Guide'' ({{ISBN|1-55022-743-2}}) by Nikki Stafford and published by [[ECW Press]] is a book detailing the show for fans and those new to the show. ''What Can Be Found in Lost?'' ({{ISBN|0-7369-2121-4}}) by John Ankerberg and Dillon Burrough, published by Harvest House is the first book dedicated to an investigation of the spiritual themes of the series from a Christian perspective.

The book explores the show's strange engagement with the contemporary experiences of war, (mis)information, and terrorism and argues that the audience functions as a character in the narrative. The author also writes a blog column<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/blog/author/joley-wood/ |title=''Lost'' blog by J.

Each post discusses the previous episode's literary, historical, philosophical, and narrative connections.\n\nThe show's networks and producers have made extensive use of the Internet in expanding the background of the story. For example, during the first season, a fictional diary by an unseen survivor called \"Janelle Granger\" was presented on the ABC web site for the series. Likewise, a tie-in website about the fictional [[Oceanic Airlines]] appeared during the first season, which included several [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter eggs]] and clues about the show. Another tie-in website was launched after the airing of \"[[Orientation (Lost)|Orientation]]\" about the Hanso Foundation. In the UK, the interactive back-stories of several characters were included in \"Lost Untold\", a section of [[Channel 4]]'s ''Lost'' website.

The show contains elements of [[supernatural fiction|supernatural]] and [[science fiction]], and follows the survivors of a commercial [[jet airliner]] flying between [[Sydney]] and [[Los Angeles]], after the plane crashes on a mysterious [[Mythology of Lost#The Island|island]] somewhere in the [[South Pacific Ocean]]. The story is told in a heavily serialized manner. Episodes typically feature a primary storyline set on the island, augmented by [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] or [[flashforward]] sequences which provide additional insight into the involved characters.\n\n''Lost'' was created by [[Jeffrey Lieber]], [[J.

[[Jack Shephard (Lost)|Jack Shephard]], a spinal surgeon, becomes their leader. Their survival is threatened by a number of mysterious entities, including polar bears, an unseen creature that roams the jungle (the \"Smoke Monster\"), and the island's malevolent inhabitants known as [[List of Lost characters#The Others|\"The Others\"]]. They encounter a French woman named [[Danielle Rousseau]], who was shipwrecked on the island 16 years before the main story and is desperate for news of her daughter, Alex. They also find a mysterious metal hatch buried in the ground. While two survivors, Locke and Boone, try to force the hatch open, four others, Michael, Jin, Walt, and Sawyer attempt to leave on a raft that they have built. Meanwhile, [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] center on details of the individual survivors' lives prior to the plane crash.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{Main|Lost (season 2)}}\nSeason 2 follows the growing conflict between the survivors and the Others and continues the theme of the clash between faith and science, while resolving old mysteries and posing new ones. The four survivors in the raft are ambushed by the Others, and they take [[Walt Lloyd|Walt]], [[Michael Dawson (Lost)|Michael]]'s son. The survivors are forced to return to the island, where they find the tail-section survivors (the \"Tailies\"). A power struggle between Jack and [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]] over control of the guns and medicine located in the hatch develops, resolved in \"[[The Long Con]]\" by [[James \"Sawyer\" Ford|Sawyer]] when he gains control of them. The hatch is revealed to be a research station built some thirty years earlier by the [[Dharma Initiative]], a scientific research project that involved conducting experiments on the island. A man named [[Desmond Hume]] had been living in the hatch for three years, activating a computer program every 108 minutes to prevent an unknown catastrophic event from occurring. To recover his son, Michael betrays the survivors, and Jack, Sawyer, and [[Kate Austen|Kate]] are captured. Michael is given a boat and leaves the island with his son, while John destroys the computer in the hatch, whereupon an electromagnetic event shakes the island. This causes the island to be detected by scientists working for [[Penelope Widmore]], and it is revealed that it was a similar event that caused the breakup of the plane.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{Main|Lost (season 3)}}\nIn Season 3, the crash survivors learn more about the Others and their long history on the mysterious island, along with the fate of the Dharma Initiative. The leader of the Others, [[Benjamin Linus]], is introduced as well and defections from both sides pave the way for conflict between the two. [[Time travel]] elements also begin to appear in the series, as Desmond is forced to turn the fail-safe key in the hatch to stop the electromagnetic event, and this sends his mind eight years to the past. When he returns to the present, he is able to see the future. Kate and Sawyer escape the Others, while Jack stays after Ben promises that Jack will be able to leave the island in a submarine if he operates on Ben, who has cancer. Jack does, but the submarine is destroyed by John. Jack is left behind with [[Juliet Burke|Juliet]], an Other, who also seeks to leave the island, while John joins the Others. A helicopter carrying Naomi crashes near the island. Naomi says her freighter, ''Kahana'', is near and was sent by [[Penelope Widmore]], Desmond's ex-girlfriend. Desmond has a vision in which [[Charlie Pace|Charlie]] will drown after shutting down a signal that prevents communication with the exterior world. His vision comes true, but Charlie speaks with Penelope, who says she does not know any Naomi. Before drowning, Charlie writes on his hand \"Not Penny's Boat\" so Desmond can read it. Meanwhile, the survivors make contact with a rescue team aboard the freighter. In the [[Through the Looking Glass (Lost)|season's finale]], apparent flashbacks show a depressed Jack going to an unknown person's funeral. In the final scene, these are revealed to be \"flash forwards\", and Kate and Jack are revealed to have escaped the island. Jack, however, is desperate to go back.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{Main|Lost (season 4)}}\nSeason 4 focuses on the survivors dealing with the arrival of people from the freighter, who have been sent to the island to reclaim it from Benjamin. \"Flash forwards\" continue, in which it is seen how six survivors, dubbed the \"Oceanic Six\", live their lives after escaping the island. The \"Oceanic Six\" are Jack, Kate, Hurley, Sayid, Sun, and Aaron. In the present, four members of the freighter arrive and team up with the survivors to escape the island, since the people of the freighter have orders to kill everyone who stays.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben travels with John to see [[Jacob (Lost)|Jacob]], the island's leader. John enters his house but finds Jack's dead father, [[Christian Shephard|Christian]], who says he can speak on Jacob's behalf, and orders John to \"move\" the island. Ben takes John to an underground station in which time travel was researched. John becomes the new leader of the Others, while Ben moves the island by turning a giant frozen wheel, after which he is transported to the [[Sahara]]. The six survivors escape in a helicopter as they watch the island disappear and are subsequently rescued by Penelope.\n\nIn the season finale, it is revealed that the funeral Jack went to in the \"flash forwards\" was that of John Locke, who had been seeking out the Oceanic Six in his efforts to convince them to return to the island.\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{Main|Lost (season 5)}}\nSeason 5 follows two timelines. The first timeline takes place on the island where the survivors who were left behind erratically jump forward and backward through time. In one of these time periods, John speaks with [[Richard Alpert (Lost)|Richard Alpert]], one of the Others, who says that to save the island, he must bring everyone back. John goes to the same underground station Ben went to. After moving the wheel himself, John is transported to the Sahara in 2007, as the time shifts on the island stop and the survivors are stranded with the [[Dharma Initiative]] in 1974. In 2007, John contacts the Oceanic Six, but no one wants to return. The last one of the Oceanic Six he finds is a depressed Jack. John tells Jack his father is alive on the island. This seriously affects Jack, and he begins taking flights, hoping to crash on the island again. Ben finds John and kills him. After John's death, the Oceanic Six are told to board the Ajira Airways Flight 316 to return to the island and in order to go back, they have to take John Locke's body in the plane. They take the flight, but some land in 1977, where they meet with the other survivors who are now part of the Dharma Initiative, and others land in 2007. The survivors in 1977 are told by [[Daniel Faraday]] that if they detonate a nuclear bomb at the hatch's construction site, the electromagnetic energy below it will be negated, and, thus, the hatch would never be built and, thus, their future could be changed. In 2007, John Locke apparently comes back to life. He instructs Richard Alpert to speak with a time-traveling John and tell him that he must bring everyone back to the island. After this, he goes to speak with Jacob. The season finale reveals that John Locke is still dead and another entity has taken over his form just to make Ben kill Jacob. In 1977, Juliet detonates the fission core taken from the hydrogen bomb.\n\n=== Season 6 ===\n{{Main|Lost (season 6)}}\nSeason 6, the final season, follows two timelines. In the first timeline, the survivors are sent to the present day, as the death of Jacob allows for his brother, the [[Man in Black (Lost)|Man in Black]], the human alter-ego of the [[Mythology of Lost#The Man in Black/The Monster|Smoke Monster]], to take over the island. Having assumed the form of John Locke, the Smoke Monster seeks to escape the island and forces a final war between the forces of good and evil.\n\nThe second timeline, called the \"flash-sideways\" narrative, follows the lives of the main characters in a setting where Oceanic 815 never crashed, though additional changes are revealed as other characters are shown living completely different lives than they did. In the final episodes, a [[Across the Sea (Lost)|flashback to the distant past]] shows the origins of the island's power and of the conflict between Jacob and the Man in Black, who are revealed to be twin brothers, with Jacob desperate to keep his brother from leaving the island after he is [[transmogrified]] by the power of the island and becomes the Smoke Monster.\n\nIn this season, Jacob's machinations are revealed: everyone was pushed by fate and his manipulation to be on the Oceanic flight as many of the members of the flight were deemed \"candidates\" by Jacob to be the new protector of the island after his passing. The Man in Black's mission since the beginning of the series: kill all of the candidates, thereby allowing him to leave the island once and for all. The ghost of Jacob appears to the last-of-the-surviving candidates, and Jack is appointed as the new protector. Jack catches up with The Man In Black, who says that he wants to go to the \"heart of the island\" to turn it off and, therefore, finally leave the island. They reach the place, but after doing this, The Man In Black becomes mortal. The Man In Black is killed by Kate, but Jack is seriously injured. [[Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes|Hurley]], one of the survivors, becomes the new caretaker of the island. Several of the survivors die in the conflict or stay on the island, and the remaining escape in the Ajira Plane once and for all. Jack returns to the \"heart of the island\" and turns it on again, saving it. Hurley, as the new protector, asks Ben to help him in his new job, which he agrees to do. After having saved the island, Jack dies peacefully in the same place in which he woke up when he arrived on the island.\n\nThe [[The End (Lost)|series finale]] reveals that the flash-sideways timeline is actually a form of [[limbo]] in the afterlife, where some of the survivors and other characters from the island are reunited after having died. In the last scene, the survivors are all reunited in a church where they \"move on\" together.\n\n=== Mythology and interpretations ===\n{{Main|Mythology of Lost}}\n<!--This is a general summary only; the specific references should go to the main Mythology article.-->\nEpisodes of ''Lost'' include a number of mysterious elements ascribed to science fiction or supernatural phenomena.

The second season also introduces Dr. Pierre Chang ([[Francois Chau]]), a member of the mysterious [[Dharma Initiative]] who appears in the orientation films for its numerous stations located throughout the island. Corporate magnate [[Charles Widmore]] ([[Alan Dale]]) has connections to both Ben and Desmond. Desmond is in love with Widmore's daughter [[Characters of Lost#Penelope \"Penny\" Widmore|Penelope \"Penny\" Widmore]] ([[Sonya Walger]]).

In the third season, [[Characters of Lost#Naomi Dorrit|Naomi Dorrit]] ([[Marsha Thomason]]), the team leader of a group hired by Widmore to find Ben Linus, parachutes onto the island. One member of her team includes the ruthless mercenary [[Martin Keamy]] ([[Kevin Durand]]). In the finale episode \"[[The End (Lost)|The End]]\", recurring guest stars [[Sam Anderson]]; [[L.

The mysterious black smoke cloud-like entity, known as \"[[Man in Black (Lost)|the Monster]]\", appeared in human form during season five and six as a middle-aged man dressed in black robes, who was played by [[Titus Welliver]], and in season six, it appears in the form of John Locke played by O'Quinn in a [[dual role]].

The producers enjoyed Monaghan's performance and changed the character of Charlie, originally an over-the-hill former rock star, to fit him. Jorge Garcia also auditioned for Sawyer, and the part of Hurley was written for him. When Josh Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked the edge he brought to the character (he reportedly kicked a chair when he forgot his lines and got angry in the audition) and his [[Southern American English|southern accent]], so they changed Sawyer to fit Holloway's acting. Yunjin Kim auditioned for Kate, but the producers wrote the character of Sun for her and the character of Jin, portrayed by Daniel Dae Kim, to be her husband. Sayid, played by Naveen Andrews, was also not in the original script. Locke and Michael were written with their actors in mind. Emilie de Ravin, who played Claire, was originally cast in what was supposed to be a recurring role.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> In the second season, Michael Emerson was contracted to play Ben (\"Henry Gale\") for three episodes.

A final soundtrack, featuring music from series finale, was released on October 11, 2010.\n\nThe series uses pop culture songs sparingly, and has a mainly orchestral score (consisting usually of divided strings, percussion, harp, and three trombones). When it features pop songs, they often originate from a [[Source cue|diegetic]] source. Examples include the various songs played on Hurley's portable CD player throughout the first season (until its batteries died in the episode \"[[...In Translation]]\", which featured Damien Rice's \"Delicate\") or the use of the record player in the second season, which included [[Cass Elliot]]'s \"[[Make Your Own Kind of Music (song)|Make Your Own Kind of Music]]\" and [[Petula Clark]]'s \"[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]\" in the second and third-season premieres respectively. Two episodes show Charlie on a street corner playing guitar and singing the [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] song \"[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]\". In the third season's finale, Jack drives down the street listening to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"Scentless Apprentice\", right before he arrives to the Hoffs/Drawlar Funeral Parlor, and in the parallel scene in the fourth season's finale, he arrives listening to \"[[Gouge Away]]\" by [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]]. The third season also used [[Three Dog Night]]'s \"[[Shambala (song)|Shambala]]\" on two occasions in the van. The only two pop songs that have ever been used without an on-screen source (i.e., non-[[diegetic]]) are [[Ann-Margret]]'s \"Slowly\", in the episode \"[[I Do (Lost)|I Do]]\" and \"I Shall Not Walk Alone\", written by [[Ben Harper]] and covered by [[The Blind Boys of Alabama]] in the episode \"[[Confidence Man (Lost)|Confidence Man]].\" Alternate music is used in several international broadcasts. For example, in the Japanese broadcast of ''Lost'', the [[Theme music|theme song]] used varies by season: season one uses \"Here I Am\" by [[Chemistry (band)|Chemistry]], season two uses \"[[Losin']]\" by [[Yuna Ito]], and season three uses \"Lonely Girl\" by [[Crystal Kay]].\n\n== Reception and impact ==\n=== Critical reception ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; text-align:center; margin:10px\"\n|+ [[Rotten Tomatoes]] ratings per season<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/lost|title=Lost|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=September 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|{{Graph:Chart\n| width = 400\n| height = 200\n| type = line\n| x = 1,2,3,4,5,6\n| y = 93,100,83,93,90,82\n| xAxisMin = 1\n| xAxisMax = 6\n| xType = string\n| yAxisMin = 50\n| yAxisMax = 100\n| xAxisTitle = Season\n| yAxisTitle = Rating\n| showSymbols = true\n}}\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|\n! scope=col | {{small|[[Lost (season 1)|Season 1]]}}\n! scope=col | {{small|[[Lost (season 2)|Season 2]]}}\n! scope=col | {{small|[[Lost (season 3)|Season 3]]}}\n! scope=col | {{small|[[Lost (season 4)|Season 4]]}}\n! scope=col | {{small|[[Lost (season 5)|Season 5]]}}\n! scope=col | {{small|[[Lost (season 6)|Season 6]]}}\n|-\n! scope=row | Rating\n| 93%\n| 100%\n| 83%\n| 93%\n| 90%\n| 82%\n|}\n|}\n\n''Lost'' has been described by numerous critics as being among the greatest television series of all time.<ref name=\"Time 100\">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2007/09/06/the-100-best-tv-shows-of-all-time/slide/lost-2/ |title=The 100 Best TV Shows of All-''TIME'' |first=James |last=Poniewozik |authorlink=James Poniewozik |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 6, 2007 |accessdate=October 23, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022172014/http://entertainment.time.com/2007/09/06/the-100-best-tv-shows-of-all-time/slide/lost-2/ |archivedate=October 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://empireonline.com/50greatesttv/default.asp?tv=5 |title=Empire: Features |work=Empire |date=December 5, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106185602/http://www.empireonline.com/50greatesttv/default.asp?tv=5 |archivedate=January 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=The New Classics: TV |url=https://ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207339,00.html |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=June 18, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020093840/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C20207339%2C00.html |archivedate=October 20, 2012}}</ref> Bill Carter, television reporter of ''[[The New York Times]]'', defined ''Lost'' as \"the show with perhaps the most compelling continuing story line in television history.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Carter |first=Bill |title=Tropical Teaser: 'Lost' Clues Decoded |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/arts/television/30lost.html |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 30, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209072605/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/arts/television/30lost.html |archivedate=December 9, 2013}}</ref> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' put the show on its end-of-the-decade, \"best-of\" list, saying, \"Name another network drama that can so wondrously turn a ? into a !\"<ref>Geier, Thom; Jensen, Jeff; Jordan, Tina; Lyons, Margaret; Markovitz, Adam; Nashawaty, Chris; Pastorek, Whitney; Rice, Lynette; Rottenberg, Josh; Schwartz, Missy; Slezak, Michael; Snierson, Dan; Stack, Tim; Stroup, Kate; Tucker, Ken; Vary, Adam B.; Vozick-Levinson, Simon; Ward, Kate (December 11, 2009), \"THE 100 Greatest MOVIES, TV SHOWS, ALBUMS, BOOKS, CHARACTERS, SCENES, EPISODES, SONGS, DRESSES, MUSIC VIDEOS, AND TRENDS THAT ENTERTAINED US OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS.\" Entertainment Weekly.

Three [[novelization]]s have been released by [[Hyperion Books]], a publisher owned by [[Disney]], ABC's parent company. They are ''Endangered Species'' ({{ISBN|0-7868-9090-8}}) and ''Secret Identity'' ({{ISBN|0-7868-9091-6}}) both by Cathy Hapka and ''Signs of Life'' ({{ISBN|0-7868-9092-4}}) by Frank Thompson. Additionally, Hyperion published a [[metafictional]] book titled ''Bad Twin'' ({{ISBN|1-4013-0276-9}}), written by Laurence Shames,<ref>{{cite news|last=Zeitchik |first=Steven |url=https://variety.com/article/VR1117945504?categoryId=14&cs=1 |title=Inside Move: It's a Shames |work=Variety |date=June 18, 2006 |accessdate=June 19, 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011102556/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117945504?categoryId=14&cs=1 |archivedate=October 11, 2011}}</ref> and credited to fictitious author \"[[Gary Troup (Lost)|Gary Troup]]\", who ABC's marketing department claimed was a passenger on Oceanic Flight 815.\n\nSeveral unofficial books relating to the show have also been published. ''Finding Lost: The Unofficial Guide'' ({{ISBN|1-55022-743-2}}) by Nikki Stafford and published by [[ECW Press]] is a book detailing the show for fans and those new to the show. ''What Can Be Found in Lost?'' ({{ISBN|0-7369-2121-4}}) by John Ankerberg and Dillon Burrough, published by Harvest House is the first book dedicated to an investigation of the spiritual themes of the series from a Christian perspective. ''Living Lost: Why We're All Stuck on the Island'' ({{ISBN|1-891053-02-7}}) by J. Wood,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gcpress.com/lost/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804000429/http://www.gcpress.com/lost/|archivedate=August 4, 2008 |title=Living Lost: Why We're All Stuck on the Island |publisher=Garrett County Press |accessdate=July 24, 2010}}</ref> published by the Garett County Press, is the first work of cultural criticism based on the series. The book explores the show's strange engagement with the contemporary experiences of war, (mis)information, and terrorism and argues that the audience functions as a character in the narrative. The author also writes a blog column<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/blog/author/joley-wood/ |title=''Lost'' blog by J. Wood |publisher=Powells.com |accessdate=July 24, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903093341/http://www.powells.com/blog/author/joley-wood/ |archivedate=September 3, 2011}}</ref> during the second part of the third season for [[Powell's Books]]. Each post discusses the previous episode's literary, historical, philosophical, and narrative connections.\n\nThe show's networks and producers have made extensive use of the Internet in expanding the background of the story. For example, during the first season, a fictional diary by an unseen survivor called \"Janelle Granger\" was presented on the ABC web site for the series. Likewise, a tie-in website about the fictional [[Oceanic Airlines]] appeared during the first season, which included several [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter eggs]] and clues about the show. Another tie-in website was launched after the airing of \"[[Orientation (Lost)|Orientation]]\" about the Hanso Foundation. In the UK, the interactive back-stories of several characters were included in \"Lost Untold\", a section of [[Channel 4]]'s ''Lost'' website. Similarly, beginning in November 2005, ABC produced an official [[podcast]], hosted by series writers and executive producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse. The podcast typically features a discussion about the weekly episode, interviews with cast members, and questions from viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index?pn=podcast |title=Lost: Podcasts |publisher=ABC |accessdate=July 24, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811055443/http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index?pn=podcast |archivedate=August 11, 2009}}</ref> [[Sky1]] also hosted a podcast presented by [[Iain Lee]] on their website, which analyzed each episode after it aired in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sky1.sky.com/the-lost-initiative |title=The Lost Initiative from Sky1 HD |publisher=Sky1 |accessdate=October 23, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813213502/http://sky1.sky.com/the-lost-initiative |archivedate=August 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe foray into the online realm culminated in the ''[[Lost Experience]]'', an Internet-based alternate reality game produced by Channel 7 (Australia), ABC (America), and Channel Four (UK), which began in early May 2006.
