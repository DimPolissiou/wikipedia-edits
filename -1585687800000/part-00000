Hysteroscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis.<ref name=pmid3381869/> Imaging by [[sonohysterography]] or [[hysterosalpingography]] will reveal the extent of the scar formation. Ultrasound is not a reliable method of diagnosing Asherman's Syndrome. Hormone studies show normal levels consistent with reproductive function.\n=== Classification ===\n\nVarious classification systems were developed to describe Asherman\u2019s syndrome (citations to be added), some taking into account the amount of functioning residual endometrium, menstrual pattern, obstetric history and other factors which are thought to play a role in determining the prognoses. With the advent of techniques which allow visualization of the uterus, classification systems were developed to take into account the location and severity of adhesions inside the uterus. This is useful as mild cases with adhesions restricted to the cervix may present with amenorrhea and infertility, showing that symptoms alone do not necessarily reflect severity. Other patients may have no adhesions but amenorrhea and infertility due to a sclerotic atrophic endometrium. The latter form has the worst prognosis.\n\n==Prevention==\nA 2013 [[scientific review|review]] concluded that there were no studies reporting on the link between intrauterine adhesions and long-term reproductive outcome after miscarriage, while similar pregnancy outcomes were reported subsequent to surgical management (e.g. D&C), medical management or conservative management (that is, [[watchful waiting]]).<ref name=pmid24082042/> There is an association between surgical intervention in the uterus and the development of intrauterine adhesions, and between intrauterine adhesions and pregnancy outcomes, but there is still no clear evidence of any method of prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes.<ref name=pmid24082042/>\n\nIn theory, the recently pregnant uterus is particularly soft under the influence of hormones and hence, easily injured. D&C (including dilation and curettage, dilation and evacuation/suction curettage and manual vacuum aspiration) is a blind, invasive procedure, making it difficult to avoid endometrial trauma. Medical alternatives to D&C for evacuation of retained placenta/products of conception exist including [[misoprostol]] and [[mifepristone]]. Studies show this less invasive and cheaper method to be an efficacious, safe and an acceptable alternative to surgical management for most women.<ref name=pmid16120856>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang J, Gilles JM, Barnhart K, Creinin MD, Westhoff C, Frederick MM | title = A comparison of medical management with misoprostol and surgical management for early pregnancy failure | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 353 | issue = 8 | pages = 761\u20139 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16120856 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa044064 }}</ref><ref name=pmid16135584>{{cite journal | vauthors = Weeks A, Alia G, Blum J, Winikoff B, Ekwaru P, Durocher J, Mirembe F | title = A randomized trial of misoprostol compared with manual vacuum aspiration for incomplete abortion | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 106 | issue = 3 | pages = 540\u20137 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16135584 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000173799.82687.dc }}</ref> It was suggested as early as in 1993<ref name=pmid8473464/> that the incidence of IUA might be lower following medical evacuation (e.g. Misoprostol) of the uterus, thus avoiding any intrauterine instrumentation.

This would enable the surgeon to end scraping the lining when all retained tissue has been removed, avoiding injury.\n\nEarly monitoring during pregnancy to identify miscarriage can prevent the development of, or as the case may be, the recurrence of AS, as the longer the period after fetal death following D&C, the more likely adhesions may be to occur.<ref name=pmid8473464/> Therefore, immediate evacuation following fetal death may prevent IUA.\n\nThe use of hysteroscopic surgery instead of D&C to remove retained products of conception or placenta is another alternative that could theoretically improve future pregnancy outcomes, although it could be less effective if tissue is abundant. Also, hysteroscopy is not a widely or routinely used technique and requires expertise.\n\nThere is no data to indicate that suction D&C is less likely than sharp curette to result in Asherman's.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is necessary in the presence of mechanical barriers to reduce the risk of possible infections. A common pharmacological method for preventing reformation of adhesions is sequential hormonal therapy with [[estrogen]] followed by a progestin to stimulate endometrial growth and prevent opposing walls from fusing together.<ref name=pmid8730623/> However, there have been no [[randomized controlled trials]] (RCTs) comparing post-surgical adhesion reformation with and without hormonal treatment and the ideal dosing regimen or length of estrogen therapy is not known. The absence of prospective RCTs comparing treatment methods makes it difficult to recommend optimal treatment protocols. Furthermore, diagnostic severity and outcomes are assessed according to different criteria (e.g. menstrual pattern, adhesion reformation rate, conception rate, live birth rate). Clearly, more comparable studies are needed in which reproductive outcome can be analysed systematically.\n\nFollow-up tests (HSG, hysteroscopy or SHG) are necessary to ensure that adhesions have not reformed. Further surgery may be necessary to restore a normal uterine cavity. According to a recent study among 61 patients, the overall rate of adhesion recurrence was 27.9% and in severe cases this was 41.9%.<ref name=pmid17681324>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu D, Li TC, Xia E, Huang X, Liu Y, Peng X | title = Factors affecting reproductive outcome of hysteroscopic adhesiolysis for Asherman's syndrome | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 715\u201322 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 17681324 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.03.070 }}</ref> Another study found that postoperative adhesions reoccur in close to 50% of severe AS and in 21.6% of moderate cases.<ref name=pmid3381869/> Mild IUA, unlike moderate to severe synechiae, do not appear to reform.\n\n== Prognosis ==\n[[File:Amniotic sheet.jpg|thumb|amniotic sheet on ultrasound]]\n\nThe extent of adhesion formation is critical.

Extensive obliteration of the uterine cavity or fallopian tube openings ([[Ostium of Fallopian tube|ostia]]) and deep endometrial or myometrial trauma may require several surgical interventions and/or hormone therapy or even be uncorrectable.

[[Menstrual]] anomalies are often but not always correlated with severity: adhesions restricted to only the [[cervix]] or lower [[uterus]] may block [[menstruation]].

This lining is composed of two layers, the [[Endometrium#Histology|functional layer]] (adjacent to the uterine cavity) which is shed during [[menstruation]] and an [[Endometrium#Histology|underlying basal layer]] (adjacent to the myometrium), which is necessary for regenerating the [[Endometrium#Histology|functional layer]]. Trauma to the basal layer, typically after a [[dilation and curettage]] (D&C) performed after a [[miscarriage]], or [[childbirth|delivery]], or for surgical termination of pregnancy, can lead to the development of intrauterine scars resulting in [[adhesions]] that can obliterate the cavity to varying degrees. In the extreme, the whole cavity can be scarred and occluded.

Hysteroscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis.<ref name=pmid3381869/> Imaging by [[sonohysterography]] or [[hysterosalpingography]] will reveal the extent of the scar formation. Ultrasound is not a reliable method of diagnosing Asherman's Syndrome. Hormone studies show normal levels consistent with reproductive function.\n=== Classification ===\n\nVarious classification systems were developed to describe Asherman\u2019s syndrome (citations to be added), some taking into account the amount of functioning residual endometrium, menstrual pattern, obstetric history and other factors which are thought to play a role in determining the prognoses. With the advent of techniques which allow visualization of the uterus, classification systems were developed to take into account the location and severity of adhesions inside the uterus. This is useful as mild cases with adhesions restricted to the cervix may present with amenorrhea and infertility, showing that symptoms alone do not necessarily reflect severity. Other patients may have no adhesions but amenorrhea and infertility due to a sclerotic atrophic endometrium. The latter form has the worst prognosis.\n\n==Prevention==\nA 2013 [[scientific review|review]] concluded that there were no studies reporting on the link between intrauterine adhesions and long-term reproductive outcome after miscarriage, while similar pregnancy outcomes were reported subsequent to surgical management (e.g. D&C), medical management or conservative management (that is, [[watchful waiting]]).<ref name=pmid24082042/> There is an association between surgical intervention in the uterus and the development of intrauterine adhesions, and between intrauterine adhesions and pregnancy outcomes, but there is still no clear evidence of any method of prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes.<ref name=pmid24082042/>\n\nIn theory, the recently pregnant uterus is particularly soft under the influence of hormones and hence, easily injured. D&C (including dilation and curettage, dilation and evacuation/suction curettage and manual vacuum aspiration) is a blind, invasive procedure, making it difficult to avoid endometrial trauma. Medical alternatives to D&C for evacuation of retained placenta/products of conception exist including [[misoprostol]] and [[mifepristone]]. Studies show this less invasive and cheaper method to be an efficacious, safe and an acceptable alternative to surgical management for most women.<ref name=pmid16120856>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang J, Gilles JM, Barnhart K, Creinin MD, Westhoff C, Frederick MM | title = A comparison of medical management with misoprostol and surgical management for early pregnancy failure | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 353 | issue = 8 | pages = 761\u20139 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16120856 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa044064 }}</ref><ref name=pmid16135584>{{cite journal | vauthors = Weeks A, Alia G, Blum J, Winikoff B, Ekwaru P, Durocher J, Mirembe F | title = A randomized trial of misoprostol compared with manual vacuum aspiration for incomplete abortion | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 106 | issue = 3 | pages = 540\u20137 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16135584 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000173799.82687.dc }}</ref> It was suggested as early as in 1993<ref name=pmid8473464/> that the incidence of IUA might be lower following medical evacuation (e.g. Misoprostol) of the uterus, thus avoiding any intrauterine instrumentation.

This would enable the surgeon to end scraping the lining when all retained tissue has been removed, avoiding injury.\n\nEarly monitoring during pregnancy to identify miscarriage can prevent the development of, or as the case may be, the recurrence of AS, as the longer the period after fetal death following D&C, the more likely adhesions may be to occur.<ref name=pmid8473464/> Therefore, immediate evacuation following fetal death may prevent IUA.\n\nThe use of hysteroscopic surgery instead of D&C to remove retained products of conception or placenta is another alternative that could theoretically improve future pregnancy outcomes, although it could be less effective if tissue is abundant. Also, hysteroscopy is not a widely or routinely used technique and requires expertise.\n\nThere is no data to indicate that suction D&C is less likely than sharp curette to result in Asherman's.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is necessary in the presence of mechanical barriers to reduce the risk of possible infections. A common pharmacological method for preventing reformation of adhesions is sequential hormonal therapy with [[estrogen]] followed by a progestin to stimulate endometrial growth and prevent opposing walls from fusing together.<ref name=pmid8730623/> However, there have been no [[randomized controlled trials]] (RCTs) comparing post-surgical adhesion reformation with and without hormonal treatment and the ideal dosing regimen or length of estrogen therapy is not known. The absence of prospective RCTs comparing treatment methods makes it difficult to recommend optimal treatment protocols. Furthermore, diagnostic severity and outcomes are assessed according to different criteria (e.g. menstrual pattern, adhesion reformation rate, conception rate, live birth rate). Clearly, more comparable studies are needed in which reproductive outcome can be analysed systematically.\n\nFollow-up tests (HSG, hysteroscopy or SHG) are necessary to ensure that adhesions have not reformed. Further surgery may be necessary to restore a normal uterine cavity. According to a recent study among 61 patients, the overall rate of adhesion recurrence was 27.9% and in severe cases this was 41.9%.<ref name=pmid17681324>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu D, Li TC, Xia E, Huang X, Liu Y, Peng X | title = Factors affecting reproductive outcome of hysteroscopic adhesiolysis for Asherman's syndrome | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 715\u201322 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 17681324 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.03.070 }}</ref> Another study found that postoperative adhesions reoccur in close to 50% of severe AS and in 21.6% of moderate cases.<ref name=pmid3381869/> Mild IUA, unlike moderate to severe synechiae, do not appear to reform.\n\n== Prognosis ==\n[[File:Amniotic sheet.jpg|thumb|amniotic sheet on ultrasound]]\n\nThe extent of adhesion formation is critical. Mild to moderate adhesions can usually be treated with success.

St. Joseph was founded in 1835 on the shores of [[St. Joseph Bay]]. A brief period of prosperity was ended by a yellow fever epidemic in 1841, and the abandoned remnants of the town were destroyed by a storm surge in 1844. The town site is in [[Gulf County, Florida]], near the city of [[Port St. Joe, Florida|Port St. Joe]].\n\n==Background==\nThe creation of St. Joseph grew out of a land dispute in [[Apalachicola, Florida]]. Early in the 19th century [[John Forbes and Company]], a Scottish-owned trading company authorized by the [[Spanish Florida#Second Spanish period|Spanish government of Florida]] to trade with Indians, had pressured [[Creek people|Creeks]] and [[Seminole]]s to settle their debts with the company by transferring title to large tracts of land in Florida. The transfers were confirmed as grants by the Spanish government. The biggest block of land, amounting to {{convert|1200000|acre|ha}} between the [[St. Marks River|St. Marks]] and [[Apalachicola River]]s, became known as the Forbes Purchase, or Forbes Grant.

By the time that ownership of the Forbes Purchase by the Apalachicola Land Company had been confirmed in court in 1835, the town of Apalachicola had grown up on the west side of the mouth of the Apalachicola River. The land company offered to sell title to the occupied lots in town, but at prices that drove many residents to abandon their homes and move west to the shores of St. Joseph Bay.{{sfn|Turner|2008|p=37}}\n\n==Growth and prosperity==\n[[File:Map of Calhoun County, Florida in 1842.jpg|thumb|Map of Calhoun County, Florida in 1842 showing the county seat of St. Joseph, Apalachicola (in Franklin County), and the rail lines of the Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Railroad, running from St. Joseph to Lake Wimico (which is unlabeled) and from St. Joseph to the Apalachicola River at Iola]]\nSt. Joseph Bay is a good natural harbor, while large ships had to anchor {{convert|16|mile}} from Apalachicola, with cargo being [[Lightering|transferred by barge between ships and the shore]].

The settlers of St. Joseph intended to divert cargo moving down the Apalachicola River, principally cotton and lumber, to the bay, bypassing Apalachicola. The [[Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal and Railroad Company|Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal Company]] was chartered by the [[Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida]] in 1835 to dig a canal between St. Joseph and [[Lake Wimico]], which was connected to the Apalachicola River by the Jackson River. Before excavation of the canal began, the company decided to connect Lake Wimico and St. Joseph with a railroad, and work was started on the roadbed. In 1836, the legislative council amended the company's charter (which become the Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal and Railroad Company) to allow it to build a railroad from any point on the Apalachicola River to St. Joseph.

By the time that ownership of the Forbes Purchase by the Apalachicola Land Company had been confirmed in court in 1835, the town of Apalachicola had grown up on the west side of the mouth of the Apalachicola River. The land company offered to sell title to the occupied lots in town, but at prices that drove many residents to abandon their homes and move west to the shores of St. Joseph Bay.{{sfn|Turner|2008|p=37}}\n\n==Growth and prosperity==\n[[File:Map of Calhoun County, Florida in 1842.jpg|thumb|Map of Calhoun County, Florida in 1842 showing the county seat of St. Joseph, Apalachicola (in Franklin County), and the rail lines of the Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Railroad, running from St. Joseph to Lake Wimico (which is unlabeled) and from St. Joseph to the Apalachicola River at Iola]]\nSt. Joseph Bay is a good natural harbor, while large ships had to anchor {{convert|16|mile}} from Apalachicola, with cargo being [[Lightering|transferred by barge between ships and the shore]].

The settlers of St. Joseph intended to divert cargo moving down the Apalachicola River, principally cotton and lumber, to the bay, bypassing Apalachicola. The [[Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal and Railroad Company|Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal Company]] was chartered by the [[Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida]] in 1835 to dig a canal between St. Joseph and [[Lake Wimico]], which was connected to the Apalachicola River by the Jackson River. Before excavation of the canal began, the company decided to connect Lake Wimico and St. Joseph with a railroad, and work was started on the roadbed. In 1836, the legislative council amended the company's charter (which become the Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal and Railroad Company) to allow it to build a railroad from any point on the Apalachicola River to St. Joseph. An {{convert|8|mile}} long rail line from St. Joseph to Lake Wimico was completed in March, 1836, and the town became a shipping port.<ref name=greattide>{{Cite news|url=http://www.starfl.com/news/20160908/deaths-angel-great-tide-of-1844|title=Death's Angel: The 'Great Tide' of 1844|last=Jones|first=Herman|date=September 8, 2016|work=The (Port St. Joe) Star|access-date=October 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy 1837 St. Joseph had become the most populous place in Florida, with an reported population between 4,000<ref name=fhs>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=July 1909|title=St. Joseph|journal=Publications of the Florida Historical Society|volume=2|issue=2|pages=23\u201326|jstor=30138240}}</ref> and 12,000<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twoegg.tv/2018/05/stjoe/|title=Remember St. Joseph: is yellow fever returning to Florida|date=May 7, 2018|website=Two Egg TV|access-date=October 15, 2018}}</ref> inhabitants.

A hurricane, \"[[1840\u201349 Atlantic hurricane seasons#1842#Hurricane Two|The Late Gale at St. Joseph]]\" hit the town on September 14, 1841, destroying the wharf, but with the collapse of trade, no ships were in port. A forest fire later that year burned part of the town. In 1843 residents of Apalachicola moved many abandoned houses to Apalachicola.

Some patients may also have an elevation of ammonia, a toxic chemical, which can affect the nervous system. Argininosuccinic aciduria may become evident in the first few days of life because of high blood ammonia, or later in life presenting with \"sparse\" or \"brittle\" hair, developmental delay, and tremors.\n\nAn infant with argininosuccinic aciduria may seem lethargic or be unwilling to eat, have poorly controlled [[breathing rate]] or [[body temperature]], experience [[seizure]]s or unusual body movements, or go into a [[coma]]. Complications from argininosuccinic aciduria may include developmental delay and [[mental retardation]]. Progressive liver damage, skin lesions, and brittle hair may also be seen. Immediate treatment and lifelong management (following a strict diet and using appropriate supplements) may prevent many of these complications.\n\nOccasionally, an individual may inherit a mild form of the disorder in which ammonia accumulates in the bloodstream only during periods of illness or other stress.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[Mutation]]s in the [[ASL (gene)|ASL]] [[gene]] cause argininosuccinic aciduria. Argininosuccinic aciduria belongs to a class of genetic diseases called [[urea cycle disorder]]s. The urea cycle is a sequence of reactions in the cells of the [[liver]]. It processes excess [[nitrogen]], generated when [[protein]] is used by the body, to make a compound called [[urea]] that is excreted by the [[kidney]]s.\n\nIn argininosuccinic aciduria, the enzyme argininosuccinate lyase, involved in the conversion of arginino succinate to arginine within the urea cycle, is damaged or missing. The urea cycle cannot proceed normally, and nitrogen accumulates in the bloodstream in the form of ammonia.\n\nAmmonia is especially damaging to the nervous system, so argininosuccinic aciduria causes neurological problems as well as eventual damage to the liver.\n\nThis condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder.\n==Diagnosis==\n\nDiagnosis is based mainly on clinical findings and laboratory test results. Plasma concentrations of ammonia (>150 \u03bcmol/L) and citrulline (200-300 \u03bcmol/L) are elevated. Elevated levels of argininosuccinic acid (5-110 \u03bcmol/L) in the plasma or urine are diagnostic. Molecular genetic testing confirms diagnosis. Newborn screening for ASA is available in the U.S. and parts of Australia, and is considered in several European countries\n\n==Treatment==\n\nDuring an acute hyperammonemic episode, oral proteins must be avoided and intravenous (I.V.) lipids, glucose and insulin (if needed) should be given to promote anabolism. I.V. nitrogen scavenging therapy (with sodium benzoate and/or sodium phenylacetate) should normalize ammonia levels, but if unsuccessful, hemodialysis is recommended. Long-term management involves dietary protein restriction as well as arginine supplementation. In those with frequent episodes of metabolic decompensation or with hyperammonemia even when following a protein-restricted diet, daily oral nitrogen scavenging therapy may be successful. Orthotopic liver transplantation offers long-term relief of hyperammonemia but does not seem to sufficiently correct neurological complications. Arterial hypertension can be treated by restoring nitric oxide deficiency\n\n== Prognosis ==\nDue to the rarity of the disease, it is hard to estimate mortality rates or life expectancy. One 2003 study which followed 88 cases receiving two different kinds of treatment found that very few persons lived beyond age 20 and none beyond age 30.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bachmann|first=Claude|date=2003-11-21|title=Long-term outcome of patients with urea cycle disorders and the question of neonatal screening|journal=European Journal of Pediatrics|language=en|volume=162|issue=1|pages=S29\u2013S33|doi=10.1007/s00431-003-1347-z|pmid=14634803|issn=0340-6199|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/312123/files/431_2003_Article_1347.pdf}}</ref>\n==Incidence==\nArgininosuccinic aciduria occurs in approximately 1 in 70,000 live births.

Arterial hypertension can be treated by restoring nitric oxide deficiency\n\n== Prognosis ==\nDue to the rarity of the disease, it is hard to estimate mortality rates or life expectancy. One 2003 study which followed 88 cases receiving two different kinds of treatment found that very few persons lived beyond age 20 and none beyond age 30.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bachmann|first=Claude|date=2003-11-21|title=Long-term outcome of patients with urea cycle disorders and the question of neonatal screening|journal=European Journal of Pediatrics|language=en|volume=162|issue=1|pages=S29\u2013S33|doi=10.1007/s00431-003-1347-z|pmid=14634803|issn=0340-6199|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/312123/files/431_2003_Article_1347.pdf}}</ref>\n==Incidence==\nArgininosuccinic aciduria occurs in approximately 1 in 70,000 live births.

{"title_page": "FEMA camps conspiracy theory", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}\nThe FEMA camps conspiracy theory holds that the United States [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) is planning to imprison US citizens in [[concentration camp]]s.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}{{R|\"Potok2014\"}}{{R|\"Lewis2008\"}} This is typically described as following the imposition of [[martial law]] in the United States after a major disaster or crisis. In some versions of the theory, only suspected dissidents will be imprisoned. In more extreme versions, large numbers of US citizens will be imprisoned for the purposes of extermination as a [[New World Order New World Order]] is established.\n\nThe theory has existed since the late 1970s, but it has picked up greatly in popularity with the advent of the internet and [[social media]] platforms.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}\n\n== About FEMA ==\n{{Main|Federal Emergency Management Agency}}\n\nFEMA is a United States government agency tasked with the effective management of major emergencies within the country, including ensuring the [[continuity of government]] during a large-scale disaster such as a [[nuclear war]]. It provides federal relief to areas afflicted by natural disasters.{{R|\"Graff2017\"}}\n\nThe precursor agency to FEMA was the [[Federal Civil Defense Administration]] established by [[President Harry S Truman]] in 1950 pursuant to executive order #10186.{{R|\"#10186\"}}\n\nFEMA was established in 1979 under executive order by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]. It was established to coordinate the response to a major disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms local and state authorities.{{R|\"#12127\"}}\n\nIn 2002 it was finally codified into law and made a component of the [[Department of Homeland Security]]. As well as providing large-scale emergency-management, FEMA is also the largest flood-insurer in the United States, mainly because most private insurance companies don't offer flood-insurance.{{R|\"Flood\"}}\n\nProponents of the conspiracy theory argue FEMA's mission is a cover up for real purpose \u2014 to assume control of the United States following a major disaster or threat \u2014 and that the organization is 'the [[executive (government)|executive]] arm of the coming [[police state]]'.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}\n\n== Variations ==\n\nThe theory in general states that once a disaster or threat of one comes into being, martial law will be declared and FEMA's emergency powers will come into operation, and it will effectively become the [[government]]. {{R|\"Knight2003\"}} The [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] will be suspended, and citizens will be moved into camps.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}{{RP|251}}\n\nIn many versions, 'dissidents' (typically defined as constitutionalists/[[patriot movement|patriots]] etc...) will merely be imprisoned.{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}} Others have gone so far as to argue that they will be sent to these camps to be murdered.{{R|\"Lewis2008\"}}\n\nExtreme versions state that plans are in place to imprison and kill apolitical American citizens in camps as part of a '[[human population control|population control]]' plot.{{R|\"Lewis2008\"}} In April 2014 Snopes posted a claim that FEMA was marking houses by political affiliation to round people up for these camps. In reality the bright, color coded stickers serve varying purposes for newspaper and mail delivery personnel.{{R|\"Mikkelson2014\"}}\n\nAlthough they do not mention FEMA specifically, the [[Oath Keepers]] list of 10 \"Orders We Will Not Obey,\" contains many of the fears shared by proponents of FEMA conspiracies.{{R|\"Williams2016\"}}\n\nProponents often play into [[racism|racial]] fear, asserting that FEMA will use 'urban gangs' as [[auxiliaries]] to ensure order.{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}}\n\nFEMA conspiracies are often worked in larger conspiracy narratives about ushering in a 'New World Order', meaning a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[world government|global government]].{{R|\"Pipes1997\"}}\n\n==History==\nOne of the first known references to FEMA concentration camps comes from a newsletter issued by [[Posse Comitatus (organization)|Posse Comitatus]] in 1982, with the warning that 'hardcore patriots' were to be detained in them.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}} The prevalence of the conspiracy theory increased in line with the rise of the [[militia movement]] in the 1990s.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}\n\nThe conspiracy was part of the rhetoric of the now largely disbanded [[Militia of Montana]]. The self-styled congressional analyst David Fletcher was their spokesman and brought it up in meetings, even pointing out \"[[United Nations]] Reserves\" that the government was building concentration camps for in the [[Cascade Range|Northern Cascades]].{{R|\"Neiwert2009\"}}\n\nA supposed FEMA camp was featured in [[Linda Thompson (attorney)|Linda Thompson's]] 1994 film ''America Under Siege'' (in reality, the 'FEMA camp' was an [[Amtrak]] repair facility).{{R|\"PM\"}}{{R|\"Amtrak\"}} She accused the government of using \"[[black helicopter]]s\" against patriots to prevent them from interfering with plans to establish a \"[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]\".{{R|\"Goodrick-Clarke\"}}{{R|\"Vest\"}}{{R|\"PartyFear\"}}\n\nFollowing the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]], the conspiracy theory was discussed by the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Domestic Terrorism.{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}}\n\nThe theory's inclusion in the plot of the 1998 [[The X-Files (film)|''X-Files'' movie]] showed its growing reach.{{R|\"Knight2003\"}}\n\nFears of FEMA declined in the early 2000s as foreign terrorists were perceived as the major threat but the [[Great Recession|late-2000s recession]] and the election of [[Barack Obama]] had renewed opposition among conservatives to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. Obama's election also enabled the theory to reach more mainstream right-wing circles whereas it had previously been confined to the fringes. There was a resurgence in the militia movement and with it a resurgence of the FEMA camps conspiracy theory{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}} and a corresponding boom in the \"[[prepper]]\" economy.{{R|\"Blake2013\"}}\n\nEmails from the magazine ''[[National Review]]'' have also promoted the theory.{{R|\"Potok2014\"}}\n\nCongresswoman [[Michele Bachmann]] alluded to the theory while in office,{{R|\"Amato2009\"}} as have other [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] politicians.{{R|\"Montgomery2014\"}}\n\nIn December 2011 [[Camille Marino]] of the hard-left animal liberation website Negotiation is Over posted an alert on her website titled \"Military Now Recruiting Guards for FEMA Domestic Detainment/Internment Camps.\" containing the usual warnings about the end of civil liberties and the announcement that the [[U.S. Army]] is looking for \"a Few Good Totalitarians\" to herd dissenters into camps.{{R|\"Nelson2011\"}}\n\nIn 2015, fears of the FEMA roundup beginning surfaced with the announcement of a domestic [[military training]] operation called [[Jade Helm 15]]. County and state officials in [[Texas]] denounced the fears{{R|\"Reinhard2015\"}} and the exercise was completed with no one being placed into an [[internment camp]].{{R|\"Smith2015\"}}\n\nAlso in 2015 additional speculation about the theory was stoked by retired general [[Wesley Clark]] when he called for World War II-style internment camps to be revived to combat Muslim extremism. He stated, \"If these people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States as a matter of principle, fine, that's their right. It\u2019s our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the conflict.\"{{R|\"Salon2015\"}}\n\nWith the end of Obama's presidency and the 2016 election approaching conspiracy theories (including the FEMA death camp idea) were heavily promoted by many on the right, from [[Alex Jones]] to [[Donald Trump]].{{R|\"Burleigh2016\"}}\n\nAccording to the [[Las Vegas Police Department]] and witnesses in the weeks leading up to the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]] gunman [[Stephen Paddock]] reportedly espoused right-wing anti-government and conspiratorial views, including FEMA conspiracies. He reportedly told a friend that \"sometimes, sacrifices have to be made\" in order to encourage the American public to arm themselves.{{R|\"Raymond2018\"}}{{R|\"Wilson2018\"}}\n\n== Evidence ==\n\n''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' has published a debunking of some of the various claims proponents of the theory make{{R|\"PM\"}} and [[FOX News]] personality [[Glenn Beck]] did a 2009 interview with James Meigs, editor-in-chief there, where he walked through a debunking of one purported camp.{{R|\"Beck2009\"}} \"This video,\" Meigs said, \"actually dates from about 1995. But like so many of these conspiracy theories, it gets re-cut and re-edited and circulated around the Internet.\"{{R|\"Salon2015\"}}\n\nBloggers at the [[Skeptic]] Project have posted detailed lists where they claim to debunk many of the FEMA camp locations in the U.S. elsewhere.{{R|\"Winston2009\"}}\n\n[[Newsweek]] emailed FEMA to inquire about the FEMA camps rumors. Press Secretary Alexa Lopez replied, \"We are currently focusing our efforts on providing assistance to disaster survivors, and the ongoing response and recovery efforts in Louisiana. As to your first question, over the years there have been many myths or rumors surrounding FEMA, and I am glad I have the chance to set the record straight with you. There is absolutely no truth to these rumors\u2014they are nothing more than conspiracy theories.\"{{R|\"Burleigh2016\"}}\n\nHowever, an internal FEMA memo shows the management understands the nature of trying to quell the conspiracies, \"Most people know us as the agency that responds to natural disasters. Others believe we have a somewhat sinister role. For the latter, it is not realistic to think that we can convince them otherwise and it is advisable not to enter into debate on the subject.\"{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}}\n\nProponents have cited a [[contingency plan]] ([[Rex 84]]) drafted in part by [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] Colonel [[Oliver North]] calling for the suspension of the Constitution and the detainment of citizens in the event of a national crisis.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}} This was aimed at left-wing activists, not the [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and right-wingers generally associated with FEMA theories.{{R|\"PRA\"}}  This has been linked to a 1970 document by [[Louis O. Giuffrida|Louis Giuffrida]] (years later, the director of FEMA) calling for the establishment of martial law in the event of an uprising by [[African American]] militants and the internment of millions of African Americans.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}\n\nConspiracy theorists have used the actual [[internment of Japanese Americans]] during [[World War II]] in specifically constructed camps as evidence that such a scenario at least has historic precedent.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}} Similarly, the forced [[Indian removal|removal]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] from their lands is an earlier precedent.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Graff2017\">{{cite web |last1=Graff |first1=Garret M. |title=THE SECRET HISTORY OF FEMA |url=https://www.wired.com/story/the-secret-history-of-fema/ |website=wired.com |accessdate=6 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Wilson2018\">{{cite news |last1=Wilson |first1=Jason |title=New documents suggest Las Vegas shooter was conspiracy theorist \u2013 what we know |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/19/stephen-paddock-las-vegas-shooter-conspiracy-theories-documents-explained |accessdate=6 June 2018 |publisher=The Guardian |date=19 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Raymond2018>{{cite news|last1=Raymond|first1=Adam|title=Witnesses: Stephen Paddock Ranted About a Government Plot to Seize Guns Prior to Las Vegas Shooting|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/05/witnesses-vegas-shooter-ranted-about-govt-gun-grabbing-plot.html|accessdate=6 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Burleigh2016\">{{cite web |last1=Burleigh |first1=Nina |title=DONALD TRUMP AND THE FEMA CAMPS CROWD |url=http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-fema-camps-crowd-491841 |website=newsweek.com |accessdate=6 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Nelson2011\">{{cite web |last1=Nelson |first1=Leah |title=COMING FULL CIRCLE: FEMA CAMP THEORY GAINS TRACTION ON FAR LEFT |url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2011/12/20/coming-full-circle-fema-camp-theory-gains-traction-far-left |website=splcenter.org |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=6 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Williams2016\">{{cite web |last1=Williams |first1=Jennifer |title=The Oath Keepers, the far-right group answering Trump's call to watch the polls, explained |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/7/13489640/oath-keepers-donald-trump-voter-fraud-intimidation-rigged |website=vox.com |accessdate=6 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Neiwert2009\">{{cite web |last1=Neiwert |first1=David |title=FEMA Concentration Camps?

It was established to coordinate the response to a major disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms local and state authorities.{{R|\"#12127\"}}\n\nIn 2002 it was finally codified into law and made a component of the [[Department of Homeland Security]]. As well as providing large-scale emergency-management, FEMA is also the largest flood-insurer in the United States, mainly because most private insurance companies don't offer flood-insurance.{{R|\"Flood\"}}\n\nProponents of the conspiracy theory argue FEMA's mission is a cover up for real purpose \u2014 to assume control of the United States following a major disaster or threat \u2014 and that the organization is 'the [[executive (government)|executive]] arm of the coming [[police state]]'.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}\n\n== Variations ==\n\nThe theory in general states that once a disaster or threat of one comes into being, martial law will be declared and FEMA's emergency powers will come into operation, and it will effectively become the [[government]]. {{R|\"Knight2003\"}} The [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] will be suspended, and citizens will be moved into camps.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}{{RP|251}}\n\nIn many versions, 'dissidents' (typically defined as constitutionalists/[[patriot movement|patriots]] etc...) will merely be imprisoned.{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}} Others have gone so far as to argue that they will be sent to these camps to be murdered.{{R|\"Lewis2008\"}}\n\nExtreme versions state that plans are in place to imprison and kill apolitical American citizens in camps as part of a '[[human population control|population control]]' plot.{{R|\"Lewis2008\"}} In April 2014 Snopes posted a claim that FEMA was marking houses by political affiliation to round people up for these camps. In reality the bright, color coded stickers serve varying purposes for newspaper and mail delivery personnel.{{R|\"Mikkelson2014\"}}\n\nAlthough they do not mention FEMA specifically, the [[Oath Keepers]] list of 10 \"Orders We Will Not Obey,\" contains many of the fears shared by proponents of FEMA conspiracies.{{R|\"Williams2016\"}}\n\nProponents often play into [[racism|racial]] fear, asserting that FEMA will use 'urban gangs' as [[auxiliaries]] to ensure order.{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}}\n\nFEMA conspiracies are often worked in larger conspiracy narratives about ushering in a 'New World Order', meaning a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[world government|global government]].{{R|\"Pipes1997\"}}\n\n==History==\nOne of the first known references to FEMA concentration camps comes from a newsletter issued by [[Posse Comitatus (organization)|Posse Comitatus]] in 1982, with the warning that 'hardcore patriots' were to be detained in them.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}} The prevalence of the conspiracy theory increased in line with the rise of the [[militia movement]] in the 1990s.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}\n\nThe conspiracy was part of the rhetoric of the now largely disbanded [[Militia of Montana]]. The self-styled congressional analyst David Fletcher was their spokesman and brought it up in meetings, even pointing out \"[[United Nations]] Reserves\" that the government was building concentration camps for in the [[Cascade Range|Northern Cascades]].{{R|\"Neiwert2009\"}}\n\nA supposed FEMA camp was featured in [[Linda Thompson (attorney)|Linda Thompson's]] 1994 film ''America Under Siege'' (in reality, the 'FEMA camp' was an [[Amtrak]] repair facility).{{R|\"PM\"}}{{R|\"Amtrak\"}} She accused the government of using \"[[black helicopter]]s\" against patriots to prevent them from interfering with plans to establish a \"[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]\".{{R|\"Goodrick-Clarke\"}}{{R|\"Vest\"}}{{R|\"PartyFear\"}}\n\nFollowing the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]], the conspiracy theory was discussed by the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Domestic Terrorism.{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}}\n\nThe theory's inclusion in the plot of the 1998 [[The X-Files (film)|''X-Files'' movie]] showed its growing reach.{{R|\"Knight2003\"}}\n\nFears of FEMA declined in the early 2000s as foreign terrorists were perceived as the major threat but the [[Great Recession|late-2000s recession]] and the election of [[Barack Obama]] had renewed opposition among conservatives to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. Obama's election also enabled the theory to reach more mainstream right-wing circles whereas it had previously been confined to the fringes. There was a resurgence in the militia movement and with it a resurgence of the FEMA camps conspiracy theory{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}} and a corresponding boom in the \"[[prepper]]\" economy.{{R|\"Blake2013\"}}\n\nEmails from the magazine ''[[National Review]]'' have also promoted the theory.{{R|\"Potok2014\"}}\n\nCongresswoman [[Michele Bachmann]] alluded to the theory while in office,{{R|\"Amato2009\"}} as have other [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] politicians.{{R|\"Montgomery2014\"}}\n\nIn December 2011 [[Camille Marino]] of the hard-left animal liberation website Negotiation is Over posted an alert on her website titled \"Military Now Recruiting Guards for FEMA Domestic Detainment/Internment Camps.\" containing the usual warnings about the end of civil liberties and the announcement that the [[U.S. Army]] is looking for \"a Few Good Totalitarians\" to herd dissenters into camps.{{R|\"Nelson2011\"}}\n\nIn 2015, fears of the FEMA roundup beginning surfaced with the announcement of a domestic [[military training]] operation called [[Jade Helm 15]]. County and state officials in [[Texas]] denounced the fears{{R|\"Reinhard2015\"}} and the exercise was completed with no one being placed into an [[internment camp]].{{R|\"Smith2015\"}}\n\nAlso in 2015 additional speculation about the theory was stoked by retired general [[Wesley Clark]] when he called for World War II-style internment camps to be revived to combat Muslim extremism. He stated, \"If these people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States as a matter of principle, fine, that's their right. It\u2019s our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the conflict.\"{{R|\"Salon2015\"}}\n\nWith the end of Obama's presidency and the 2016 election approaching conspiracy theories (including the FEMA death camp idea) were heavily promoted by many on the right, from [[Alex Jones]] to [[Donald Trump]].{{R|\"Burleigh2016\"}}\n\nAccording to the [[Las Vegas Police Department]] and witnesses in the weeks leading up to the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]] gunman [[Stephen Paddock]] reportedly espoused right-wing anti-government and conspiratorial views, including FEMA conspiracies. He reportedly told a friend that \"sometimes, sacrifices have to be made\" in order to encourage the American public to arm themselves.{{R|\"Raymond2018\"}}{{R|\"Wilson2018\"}}\n\n== Evidence ==\n\n''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' has published a debunking of some of the various claims proponents of the theory make{{R|\"PM\"}} and [[FOX News]] personality [[Glenn Beck]] did a 2009 interview with James Meigs, editor-in-chief there, where he walked through a debunking of one purported camp.{{R|\"Beck2009\"}} \"This video,\" Meigs said, \"actually dates from about 1995. But like so many of these conspiracy theories, it gets re-cut and re-edited and circulated around the Internet.\"{{R|\"Salon2015\"}}\n\nBloggers at the [[Skeptic]] Project have posted detailed lists where they claim to debunk many of the FEMA camp locations in the U.S. elsewhere.{{R|\"Winston2009\"}}\n\n[[Newsweek]] emailed FEMA to inquire about the FEMA camps rumors. Press Secretary Alexa Lopez replied, \"We are currently focusing our efforts on providing assistance to disaster survivors, and the ongoing response and recovery efforts in Louisiana. As to your first question, over the years there have been many myths or rumors surrounding FEMA, and I am glad I have the chance to set the record straight with you. There is absolutely no truth to these rumors\u2014they are nothing more than conspiracy theories.\"{{R|\"Burleigh2016\"}}\n\nHowever, an internal FEMA memo shows the management understands the nature of trying to quell the conspiracies, \"Most people know us as the agency that responds to natural disasters. Others believe we have a somewhat sinister role. For the latter, it is not realistic to think that we can convince them otherwise and it is advisable not to enter into debate on the subject.\"{{R|\"Zaitchik2010\"}}\n\nProponents have cited a [[contingency plan]] ([[Rex 84]]) drafted in part by [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] Colonel [[Oliver North]] calling for the suspension of the Constitution and the detainment of citizens in the event of a national crisis.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}} This was aimed at left-wing activists, not the [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and right-wingers generally associated with FEMA theories.{{R|\"PRA\"}}  This has been linked to a 1970 document by [[Louis O. Giuffrida|Louis Giuffrida]] (years later, the director of FEMA) calling for the establishment of martial law in the event of an uprising by [[African American]] militants and the internment of millions of African Americans.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}}\n\nConspiracy theorists have used the actual [[internment of Japanese Americans]] during [[World War II]] in specifically constructed camps as evidence that such a scenario at least has historic precedent.{{R|\"Keller2011\"}} Similarly, the forced [[Indian removal|removal]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] from their lands is an earlier precedent.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Graff2017\">{{cite web |last1=Graff |first1=Garret M. |title=THE SECRET HISTORY OF FEMA |url=https://www.wired.com/story/the-secret-history-of-fema/ |website=wired.com |accessdate=6 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Wilson2018\">{{cite news |last1=Wilson |first1=Jason |title=New documents suggest Las Vegas shooter was conspiracy theorist \u2013 what we know |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/19/stephen-paddock-las-vegas-shooter-conspiracy-theories-documents-explained |accessdate=6 June 2018 |publisher=The Guardian |date=19 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Raymond2018>{{cite news|last1=Raymond|first1=Adam|title=Witnesses: Stephen Paddock Ranted About a Government Plot to Seize Guns Prior to Las Vegas Shooting|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/05/witnesses-vegas-shooter-ranted-about-govt-gun-grabbing-plot.html|accessdate=6 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Burleigh2016\">{{cite web |last1=Burleigh |first1=Nina |title=DONALD TRUMP AND THE FEMA CAMPS CROWD |url=http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-fema-camps-crowd-491841 |website=newsweek.com |accessdate=6 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Nelson2011\">{{cite web |last1=Nelson |first1=Leah |title=COMING FULL CIRCLE: FEMA CAMP THEORY GAINS TRACTION ON FAR LEFT |url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2011/12/20/coming-full-circle-fema-camp-theory-gains-traction-far-left |website=splcenter.org |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |accessdate=6 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Williams2016\">{{cite web |last1=Williams |first1=Jennifer |title=The Oath Keepers, the far-right group answering Trump's call to watch the polls, explained |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/7/13489640/oath-keepers-donald-trump-voter-fraud-intimidation-rigged |website=vox.com |accessdate=6 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Neiwert2009\">{{cite web |last1=Neiwert |first1=David |title=FEMA Concentration Camps?

{"title_page": "Salamander letter", "text_new": "The '''salamander letter''' was a controversial document about the history of the [[Latter-day Saint movement]] that later proved to be a forgery.\n\nThe letter was one of hundreds of documents concerning the history of LDS movement that surfaced in the early 1980s. The salamander letter presented a view of Latter-day Saint founder [[Joseph Smith]]'s life that stood sharply at odds with the commonly accepted version of the early progression of the church Smith established.\n\nInitially accepted by some document experts and collectors, and rejected by others,<ref>{{Harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2005}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}</ref> the salamander letter generated much discussion and debate inside and outside the Latter-day Saint movement. [[Kenneth W. Rendell]], a prominent dealer of historical papers, lent credence to the salamander letter by stating that the ink, paper and postmark were all consistent with the period; he concluded that \"there is no indication that the document is a forgery.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2005|pp=169\u201370}}</ref>  The document was later demonstrated to be a forgery created by [[Mark Hofmann]], who had been responsible for the \"discovery\" of many other notable documents.  Rendell then recast his conclusion, stating that while there was \"the absence of any indication of forgery in the letter itself, there was also no evidence that it was genuine.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Rendell|1994|p=130}}</ref>\n\n==Contents==\nThe contents of the letter implied a [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] aspect to Smith's life, a controversial subject debated amongst scholars of Latter-day Saint history. The salamander letter was supposedly written by [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] to [[William Wines Phelps]], an early convert in the Latter-day Saint movement. Harris served for a short period of time as scribe for the translation of the [[golden plates]], and assisted in the financing of the first printing of the [[Book of Mormon]]. A statement by Harris appears in the front of the [[Book of Mormon]] concerning stating that he was shown by an angel the golden plates from which the book was translated.\n\nThe letter presented a version of the recovery of the golden plates which contrasted with the \"orthodox\" version of events as related by Joseph Smith and the Latter-day Saint movement, which would have, if true, confirmed some controversial aspects of Smith's life. Smith had been accused of \"treasure digging\" and use of a \"[[Seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seer stone]]\".\n\nAccording to this letter, when Smith dug up the plates a \"salamander\" appeared, which transformed itself into a spirit that refused to give Smith the plates unless his brother [[Alvin Smith (Mormon)|Alvin Smith]] was also present. This would have been very difficult, as Alvin was dead at the time of the alleged appearance.  This reference may have been an attempt by Hofmann to associate the recovery of the gold plates to a rumor that Alvin's grave was dug up by Smith's family to use Alvin's remains in a magical ceremony.\n\nHofmann's use of a [[salamander]] drew upon legends about certain animals having supernatural powers. Hofmann may have been inspired by an early anti-Mormon work ''[[Mormonism Unvailed]]''  (1834), which claimed that a toad-like animal was rumored to have appeared to Smith in conjunction with the recovery of the plates.\n\n===Text of the Salamander Letter===\n{{Copy section to Wikisource}}\n:Palmyra October 23d 1830\n\n:Dear Sir\n\n:Your letter of yesterday is received & I hasten to answer as fully as I can--Joseph Smith Jr first come to my notice in the year 1824 in the summer of that year I contracted with his father to build a fence on my property in the corse {sic} of that work I approach Joseph & ask how it is in a half day you put up what requires your father & 2 brothers a full day working together he says I have not been with out assistance but can not say more only you better find out the next day I take the older Smith by the arm & he says Joseph can see any thing he wishes by looking at a stone Joseph often sees Spirits here with great kettles of coin money it was Spirits who brought up rock because Joseph made no attempt on their money I latter dream I converse with spirits which let me count their money when I awake I have in my hand a dollar coin which I take for a sign Joseph describes what I seen in every particular says he the spirits are grieved so I through {sic} back the dollar in the fall of the year 1827 I hear Joseph found a gold bible I take Joseph aside & he says it is true I found it 4 years ago with my stone but only just got it because of the enchantment the old spirit come to me 3 times in the same dream & says dig up the gold but when I take it up the next morning the spirit transfigured himself from a white salamander in the bottom of the hole & struck me 3 times & held the treasure & would not let me have it because I lay it down to cover over the hole when the spirit says do not lay it down Joseph says when can I have it the spirit says one year from to day if you obay {sic} me look to the stone after a few days he looks the spirit says bring your brother Alvin Joseph says he is dead shall I bring what remains but the spirit is gone Joseph goes to get the gold bible but the spirit says you did not bring your brother you can not have it look to the stone Joseph looks but can not see who to bring the spirit says I tricked you again look to the stone Joseph looks & sees his wife on the 22d day of Sept 1827 they get the gold bible--I give Joseph $50 to move him down to Pa Joseph says when you visit me I will give you a sign he gives me some hiroglyphics I take then to Utica Albany & New York in the last place Dr Mitchel gives me an introduction to Professor Anthon says he they are short hand Egyption {sic} the same what was used in ancient times bring me the old book & I will translate says I it is made of precious gold & is sealed from view says he I can not read a sealed book--Joseph found some giant silver spectacles with the plates he puts them in an old hat & in the darkness reads the words & in this way it is all translated & written down--about the middle of June 1829 Joseph takes me together with Oliver Cowdery & David Whitmer to have a view of the plates our names are appended to the book of Mormon which I had printed with my own money--space and time both prevent me from writing more at present if there is any thing further you wish to inquire I shall attend to it\n\n:Yours Respectfully\n:Martin Harris\n(sic)\n\n==Authenticity==\nThe letter was deemed authentic by experienced document examiners, a testimony to Hofmann's superior forgery techniques. The letter also seemed to support the opinions of [[Reed Durham]], [[D. Michael Quinn]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=330}}</ref> and others regarding \"magical\" aspects of Smith's religious experiences.\n\n==Purchase and publicity==\n[[File:1860 Utah $10 gold piece.jpeg|thumb|A Mormon gold piece]]\nThe letter was initially offered to [[Don Schmidt]] of the [[Church Historical Department]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) on January 3, 1984, by Lyn Jacobs, who wanted to trade it for a $10 Mormon gold piece. Jacobs told Schmidt that he got the letter from a collector in the east, referred by Mark Hofmann. Jacobs later changed his offer to a trade for a copy of a [[Book of Commandments]]. This offer was also rejected. Jacobs also suggested that Brent Ashworth might have an interest in it, although Hofmann had already showed a transcript of it to him and he had declared it to be fake.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The contents of the letter also seemed too similar to Howe's ''[[Mormonism Unvailed]]'' to others in the church Historical Department. The letter was also offered to other interested parties, including [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]], prominent critics of Mormonism. Although the letter seemingly bolstered the Tanners' claims against the church, they expressed doubts as to its authenticity. A deal with the LDS Church was never reached. Hofmann finally sold the letter to Steven F. Christensen on January 6, 1984, for $40,000. Christensen wanted to try to authenticate it and then donate it to the LDS Church.\n\nIn ''[[Church News]]'' on April 28, 1985, the LDS Church revealed the contents of the salamander letter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turley|1992|p=99}}</ref> At about this same time, the church also released a letter to its high school [[Seminary (LDS Church)|seminary]] program for youth, suggesting that seminary teachers not encourage debate about the salamander letter, but that they should tactfully answer genuine questions on the subject. [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies|FARMS]] (a research group composed of LDS scholars, but which at the time had no formal connection to the LDS Church) published several articles which examined the Salamander Letter, such as \"Why Might a Person in 1830 Connect an Angel With a Salamander?\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanner|1987|loc=Appendix A}}</ref>\n\n==Suspicion and resolution==\nHofmann drew suspicion for discovering so many astounding documents that others had missed, including the so-called \"[[Oath of a Freeman]]\", which he was attempting to sell to the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nBy early 1984, Jerald Tanner concluded there was significant doubt as to the salamander letter's authenticity.  He even went as far as to publish an attack on the document, which surprised many scholars and students since this and other \"discoveries\" of important Mormon documents by Hofmann often appeared to bolster the Tanners' own arguments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schindler|1987}}</ref> By late 1984, Jerald Tanner questioned the authenticity of most if not all of Hofmann's \"discoveries\", based in large part on their unproven provenance. The Tanners did concur with Hofmann in contending that the LDS Church's apparent inability to discern the forged documents was evidence against church leadership being [[Revelation|divinely inspired]].

In 1985, when he learned that the pedigree of the salamander letter was under widespread suspicion, he produced and a placed a number of bombs as a diversionary tactic. They were detonated with a [[mercury switch]], but without a safety switch. Two people were killed: Christensen at his office, the main target; and Kathleen Sheets at her home. That bomb was intended as a diversion, to draw off investigators. Hofmann himself was subsequently injured when a third bomb went off prematurely in his car. That bomb exploded in a way that most of the blast did not hit Hofmann. The police investigated these bombings, and during a search of Hofmann's home found a studio in the basement where he could create counterfeited documents as well as a semi-automatic carbine which had been converted to full automatic fire.  Many of the documents Hofmann sold or donated were proven to be forgeries by a new forensic technique developed by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], chiefly to detect his forgeries. The [[Salt Lake City Police Department]] used Utah State special agent and forensic examiner George Throckmorton and Arizona document examiner William Flynn to examine a poem supposedly written by Harris and placed in his old [[Book of Common Prayer]] and determined it had actually been created by Hofmann.  Hofmann used the poem to authenticate the writing in the salamander letter.  Although this was enough proof by itself that the letter was a forgery, Throckmorton and Flynn bolstered their case by getting in touch with Frances Magee, the widow of a descendant of Robert Harris.  Magee's family had owned the book for many years, and Magee told investigators that she'd never seen the poem before.  She suspected someone had planted it there after she sold the book.  Hofmann ultimately pleaded guilty to his forgeries and murders, and was sentenced to life in prison.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lindsey|1988}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}</ref>\n\nChurch leaders, especially [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] member [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], continued to field criticism for some time for \"being duped\" and being \"unable to discern the evil intentions of a man like Hofmann\". Hinckley later noted: \"I accepted him to come into my office on a basis of trust .... I frankly admit that Hofmann tricked us. He also tricked experts from New York to Utah, however .... I am not ashamed to admit that we were victimized. It is not the first time the Church has found itself in such a position. Joseph Smith was victimized again and again. The Savior was victimized. I am sorry to say that sometimes it happens.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Dew|1996|p=432}}</ref>\n\n==Lasting effects==\n\nMore than twenty years later, effects of the letter still lingered. The letter was referenced in research by both Mormons and critics of Mormonism alike.  Resulting publications that include conclusions based on the presumption that the letter was authentic are still available and may influence the opinions of those seeking information on \"deep Mormon doctrine\" or evidence to support a naturalistic or magical historical view of Mormonism or Joseph Smith. In addition, Hofmann produced and sold several other documents relating to significant events in Latter Day Saint history which were fake.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n[[Grant H. Palmer]], author of the book ''[[An Insider's View of Mormon Origins]]'' stated that his work was influenced in part by his original acceptance of the salamander letter as being valid and supportive of his view.<ref>{{Harvnb|Midgley|2003}}</ref> Palmer stated that the \"salamander letter\" caused him to explore Joseph Smith's \"mystical mindset\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Palmer|2010}}</ref>\n\nThe salamander letter also influenced the content of the film ''[[The God Makers II (Film)|The God Makers II]]'', an alleged expos\u00e9 of Mormonism. The film suggests that Joseph Smith was required to dig up his brother Alvin's body and bring a part of it with him to the hill [[Cumorah]] in order to obtain the [[golden plates]] from which the [[Book of Mormon]] was said to be translated.  Jerald and Sandra Tanner refuted this suggestion, and determined that the only known source of such a requirement would have been the salamander letter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanner|Tanner|1993|p=7}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Salamander (legendary creature)]]\n*[[Treasure guardians in folklore]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*{{Citation\n | last        = Anderson\n | first       = Richard Lloyd \n | author-link = Richard Lloyd Anderson\n | title       = The Alvin Smith Story: Fact and Fiction \n | journal     = [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]\n | date        = August 1987 \n | url         = https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1987/08/the-alvin-smith-story-fact-and-fiction?lang=eng\n }}.\n*{{Citation\n | last= Dew\n | first= Sheri\n | authorlink= Sheri Dew\n | title= Go Forward with Faith: The Biography of Gordon B.

The salamander letter presented a view of Latter-day Saint founder [[Joseph Smith]]'s life that stood sharply at odds with the commonly accepted version of the early progression of the church Smith established.\n\nInitially accepted by some document experts and collectors, and rejected by others,<ref>{{Harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2005}}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}</ref> the salamander letter generated much discussion and debate inside and outside the Latter-day Saint movement. [[Kenneth W. Rendell]], a prominent dealer of historical papers, lent credence to the salamander letter by stating that the ink, paper and postmark were all consistent with the period; he concluded that \"there is no indication that the document is a forgery.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Naifeh|Smith|2005|pp=169\u201370}}</ref>  The document was later demonstrated to be a forgery created by [[Mark Hofmann]], who had been responsible for the \"discovery\" of many other notable documents.  Rendell then recast his conclusion, stating that while there was \"the absence of any indication of forgery in the letter itself, there was also no evidence that it was genuine.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Rendell|1994|p=130}}</ref>\n\n==Contents==\nThe contents of the letter implied a [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] aspect to Smith's life, a controversial subject debated amongst scholars of Latter-day Saint history. The salamander letter was supposedly written by [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] to [[William Wines Phelps]], an early convert in the Latter-day Saint movement. Harris served for a short period of time as scribe for the translation of the [[golden plates]], and assisted in the financing of the first printing of the [[Book of Mormon]]. A statement by Harris appears in the front of the [[Book of Mormon]] concerning his involvement in its translation.\n\nThe letter presented a version of the recovery of the golden plates which contrasted with the \"orthodox\" version of events as related by Joseph Smith and the Latter-day Saint movement, which would have, if true, confirmed some controversial aspects of Smith's life. Smith had been accused of \"treasure digging\" and use of a \"[[Seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seer stone]]\".\n\nAccording to this letter, when Smith dug up the plates a \"salamander\" appeared, which transformed itself into a spirit that refused to give Smith the plates unless his brother [[Alvin Smith (Mormon)|Alvin Smith]] was also present. This would have been very difficult, as Alvin was dead at the time of the alleged appearance.  This reference may have been an attempt by Hofmann to associate the recovery of the gold plates to a rumor that Alvin's grave was dug up by Smith's family to use Alvin's remains in a magical ceremony.\n\nHofmann's use of a [[salamander]] drew upon legends about certain animals having supernatural powers. Hofmann may have been inspired by an early anti-Mormon work ''[[Mormonism Unvailed]]''  (1834), which claimed that a toad-like animal was rumored to have appeared to Smith in conjunction with the recovery of the plates.\n\n===Text of the Salamander Letter===\n{{Copy section to Wikisource}}\n:Palmyra October 23d 1830\n\n:Dear Sir\n\n:Your letter of yesterday is received & I hasten to answer as fully as I can--Joseph Smith Jr first come to my notice in the year 1824 in the summer of that year I contracted with his father to build a fence on my property in the corse {sic} of that work I approach Joseph & ask how it is in a half day you put up what requires your father & 2 brothers a full day working together he says I have not been with out assistance but can not say more only you better find out the next day I take the older Smith by the arm & he says Joseph can see any thing he wishes by looking at a stone Joseph often sees Spirits here with great kettles of coin money it was Spirits who brought up rock because Joseph made no attempt on their money I latter dream I converse with spirits which let me count their money when I awake I have in my hand a dollar coin which I take for a sign Joseph describes what I seen in every particular says he the spirits are grieved so I through {sic} back the dollar in the fall of the year 1827 I hear Joseph found a gold bible I take Joseph aside & he says it is true I found it 4 years ago with my stone but only just got it because of the enchantment the old spirit come to me 3 times in the same dream & says dig up the gold but when I take it up the next morning the spirit transfigured himself from a white salamander in the bottom of the hole & struck me 3 times & held the treasure & would not let me have it because I lay it down to cover over the hole when the spirit says do not lay it down Joseph says when can I have it the spirit says one year from to day if you obay {sic} me look to the stone after a few days he looks the spirit says bring your brother Alvin Joseph says he is dead shall I bring what remains but the spirit is gone Joseph goes to get the gold bible but the spirit says you did not bring your brother you can not have it look to the stone Joseph looks but can not see who to bring the spirit says I tricked you again look to the stone Joseph looks & sees his wife on the 22d day of Sept 1827 they get the gold bible--I give Joseph $50 to move him down to Pa Joseph says when you visit me I will give you a sign he gives me some hiroglyphics I take then to Utica Albany & New York in the last place Dr Mitchel gives me an introduction to Professor Anthon says he they are short hand Egyption {sic} the same what was used in ancient times bring me the old book & I will translate says I it is made of precious gold & is sealed from view says he I can not read a sealed book--Joseph found some giant silver spectacles with the plates he puts them in an old hat & in the darkness reads the words & in this way it is all translated & written down--about the middle of June 1829 Joseph takes me together with Oliver Cowdery & David Whitmer to have a view of the plates our names are appended to the book of Mormon which I had printed with my own money--space and time both prevent me from writing more at present if there is any thing further you wish to inquire I shall attend to it\n\n:Yours Respectfully\n:Martin Harris\n(sic)\n\n==Authenticity==\nThe letter was deemed authentic by experienced document examiners, a testimony to Hofmann's superior forgery techniques. The letter also seemed to support the opinions of [[Reed Durham]], [[D. Michael Quinn]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=330}}</ref> and others regarding \"magical\" aspects of Smith's religious experiences.\n\n==Purchase and publicity==\n[[File:1860 Utah $10 gold piece.jpeg|thumb|A Mormon gold piece]]\nThe letter was initially offered to [[Don Schmidt]] of the [[Church Historical Department]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) on January 3, 1984, by Lyn Jacobs, who wanted to trade it for a $10 Mormon gold piece. Jacobs told Schmidt that he got the letter from a collector in the east, referred by Mark Hofmann. Jacobs later changed his offer to a trade for a copy of a [[Book of Commandments]]. This offer was also rejected. Jacobs also suggested that Brent Ashworth might have an interest in it, although Hofmann had already showed a transcript of it to him and he had declared it to be fake.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The contents of the letter also seemed too similar to Howe's ''[[Mormonism Unvailed]]'' to others in the church Historical Department. The letter was also offered to other interested parties, including [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]], prominent critics of Mormonism. Although the letter seemingly bolstered the Tanners' claims against the church, they expressed doubts as to its authenticity. A deal with the LDS Church was never reached. Hofmann finally sold the letter to Steven F. Christensen on January 6, 1984, for $40,000. Christensen wanted to try to authenticate it and then donate it to the LDS Church.\n\nIn ''[[Church News]]'' on April 28, 1985, the LDS Church revealed the contents of the salamander letter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turley|1992|p=99}}</ref> At about this same time, the church also released a letter to its high school [[Seminary (LDS Church)|seminary]] program for youth, suggesting that seminary teachers not encourage debate about the salamander letter, but that they should tactfully answer genuine questions on the subject. [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies|FARMS]] (a research group composed of LDS scholars, but which at the time had no formal connection to the LDS Church) published several articles which examined the Salamander Letter, such as \"Why Might a Person in 1830 Connect an Angel With a Salamander?\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanner|1987|loc=Appendix A}}</ref>\n\n==Suspicion and resolution==\nHofmann drew suspicion for discovering so many astounding documents that others had missed, including the so-called \"[[Oath of a Freeman]]\", which he was attempting to sell to the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nBy early 1984, Jerald Tanner concluded there was significant doubt as to the salamander letter's authenticity.  He even went as far as to publish an attack on the document, which surprised many scholars and students since this and other \"discoveries\" of important Mormon documents by Hofmann often appeared to bolster the Tanners' own arguments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Schindler|1987}}</ref> By late 1984, Jerald Tanner questioned the authenticity of most if not all of Hofmann's \"discoveries\", based in large part on their unproven provenance. The Tanners did concur with Hofmann in contending that the LDS Church's apparent inability to discern the forged documents was evidence against church leadership being [[Revelation|divinely inspired]]. John Tvedtnes, an LDS scholar, responded with Joseph Smith's statement that \"a prophet was a prophet only when he was acting as such,\" and that purchasing historical materials is a business activity rather than a prophetic undertaking.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tvedtnes|1994|p=210}}</ref> It is also asserted that the LDS leaders do not claim [[infallibility]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Faust |first1=James E. |title=Continuous Revelation |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1989/10/continuous-revelation?lang=eng |date=October 1989 |quote=We make no claim of infallibility or perfection in the prophets, seers, and revelators.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/enrichment-f-as-if-from-mine-own-mouth-the-role-of-prophets-in-the-church?lang=eng |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |pages=389\u201392 |date=2002 |quote=No claim is put forth by the prophets of God to suggest that they are infallible, that everything they say and do is what the Lord would say and do.

Jerald and Sandra Tanner refuted this suggestion, and determined that the only known source of such a requirement would have been the salamander letter.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanner|Tanner|1993|p=7}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Salamander (legendary creature)]]\n*[[Treasure guardians in folklore]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*{{Citation\n | last        = Anderson\n | first       = Richard Lloyd \n | author-link = Richard Lloyd Anderson\n | title       = The Alvin Smith Story: Fact and Fiction \n | journal     = [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]\n | date        = August 1987 \n | url         = https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1987/08/the-alvin-smith-story-fact-and-fiction?lang=eng\n }}.\n*{{Citation\n | last= Dew\n | first= Sheri\n | authorlink= Sheri Dew\n | title= Go Forward with Faith: The Biography of Gordon B.

Both the strengths and weaknesses of the horse's visual abilities should be taken into consideration when training the animal, as an understanding of the horse's eye can help to discover why the animal behaves the way it does in various situations.\n\n==The anatomy of the equine eye==\nThe equine eye includes the eyeball and the surrounding muscles and structures, termed the [[Accessory visual structures|adnexa]].\n\n===The eyeball===\nThe eyeball of the horse is not perfectly spherical, but rather is flattened anterior to posterior. However, research has found the horse does not have a ramped retina, as was once thought.<ref name=\"Sivak JG 1356\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0042-6989(75)90189-3 | last1 = Sivak | first1 = JG | last2 = Allen | first2 = DB. |name-list-format=vanc | year = 1975 | title = An evaluation of the ramp retina on the horse eye | url = | journal = Vision Res | volume = 15 | issue = 12| pages = 1353\u20131356 | pmid = 1210017 }}</ref>\n\nThe wall of the eye is made up of three layers: the internal or nervous tunic, the vascular tunic, and the fibrous tunic.\n* The '''nervous tunic''' (or [[retina]]) is made up of cells which are extensions of the brain, coming off the optic nerve. These receptors are light-sensitive, and include [[cone cell|cones]], which are less light-sensitive, but allow the eye to see color and provide visual acuity, and [[rod cells]], which are more light-sensitive, providing night vision, but only seeing light and dark differences. Since only two-thirds of the eye can receive light, the receptor cells do not need to cover the entire interior of the eye, and line only the area from [[pupil]] to the [[optic disk]]. The part of the retina covered by light-sensitive cells is therefore termed the pars-optica retinae, and the blind part of the eye is termed the pars-ceaca retinae. The optic disk of the eye, however, does not contain any of these light-sensitive cells, as it is where the optic nerve leaves to the brain, so is a blind spot within the eye.<ref name=\"Riegal, Ronald J 2000\">Riegal, Ronald J.

Copyright 2000.</ref>\n* The '''vascular tunic''' (or [[uvea]]) is made up of the [[choroid]], the [[ciliary body]], and the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]]. The choroid has a great deal of pigment, and is almost entirely made of blood vessels. It forms the [[tapetum lucidum]] when it crosses over the [[fundus (eye)|fundus]] of the eye, causing the yellowish-green eye shine when light is directed into the animal's eyes at night. The tapetum lucidum reflects light back onto the retina, allowing for greater absorption in dark conditions. The iris lies between the cornea and the [[lens (anatomy)|lens]], and not only gives the eye its color, (''see \"eye color,\" below'') but also allows varying amounts of light to pass through its center hole, the [[pupil]].<ref name=\"Riegal, Ronald J 2000\"/> <!-- Line breaks break bulleted lists\n -->\n* The '''fibrous tunic''' consists of the [[sclera]] and [[cornea]] and protects the eye. The sclera (white of the eye) is made up of [[elastin]] and [[collagen]]. The cornea (clear covering on the front of the eye) is made up of connective tissue and bathed in lacrimal fluid and aqueous humor, which provides it nutrition, as it does not have access to blood vessels.<ref name=\"Riegal, Ronald J 2000\"/>\n*The [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] of the eye lies posterior to the iris, and is held suspended by the ciliary suspensory ligament and the ciliary muscle, which allows for \"accommodation\" of the eye: it allows the lens to change shape to focus on different objects. The lens is made up of onion-like layers of tissue.<ref name=\"Riegal, Ronald J 2000\"/>\n\n====Eye color====\n[[Image:Creamvswhite-eyes.JPG|right|thumb|Homozygous cream dilutes (\"double-dilutes\") have pale blue eyes, while the blue eyes associated with white markings (bottom) are a clearer, deeper color.]]\nAlthough usually dark brown, the iris may be a variety of colors, including blue, hazel, amber, and green.

The opening between the two lids forms the palpebral tissue. The upper eyelid is larger and can move more than the lower lid. Unlike humans, horses also have a third eyelid ([[nictitating membrane]]) to protect the cornea. It lies on the inside corner of the eye, and closes diagonally over it.\n\nThe [[lacrimal apparatus]] produces tears, providing nutrition and moisture to the eye, as well as helping to remove any debris that may have entered. The apparatus includes the lacrimal gland and the accessory lacrimal gland, which produce the tears. Blinking spreads the fluid over the eye, before it drains via the [[nasolacrimal duct]], which carries the lacrimal fluid into the nostril of the horse.<ref name=\"Riegal, Ronald J 2000\"/>\n\nThe ocular muscles allow the eye to move within the skull.\n\n==Visual capacity of the horse==\n===Visual field===\n[[Image:Horse360.png|thumb|The range of a horse's monocular vision, blind spots are in shaded areas]]\n[[Image:DistanceHorse.png|thumb|A horse can use binocular vision to focus on distant objects by raising its head.]]\n[[Image:CollectedVision.png|thumb|A horse with the head held vertically will have binocular focus on objects near its feet.<ref>Miller, Robert W. ''Western Horse Behavior and Training.'' Main Street Books, 1975. {{ISBN|0-385-08181-2}} {{ISBN|978-0-385-08181-8}}</ref>]]\nHorse eyes are among the largest of any land mammal, and are positioned on the sides of the head (that is, they are positioned [[Lateral (anatomy)|laterally]]).<ref name=\"Hartley 2016\" /> This means horses have a range of vision of about 350\u00b0, with approximately 65\u00b0 of this being [[binocular vision]] and the remaining 285\u00b0 [[monocular vision]].<ref name=\"Sellnow, Happy Trails, p. 46\">Sellnow, ''Happy Trails'', p. 46</ref>\n\nThis provides a horse with the best chance to spot predators.  The horse's wide range of monocular vision has two \"blind spots,\" or areas where the animal cannot see: in front of the face, making a cone that comes to a point at about 90\u2013120&nbsp;cm (3\u20134&nbsp;ft) in front of the horse, and right behind its head, which extends over the back and behind the tail when standing with the head facing straight forward. Therefore, as a horse jumps an obstacle, it briefly disappears from sight right before the horse takes off.\n\nThe wide range of monocular vision has a trade-off:  The placement of the horse's eyes decreases the possible range of binocular vision to around 65\u00b0 on a horizontal plane, occurring in a triangular shape primarily in front of the horse's face.  Therefore, the horse has a smaller field of depth perception than a human.<ref name=\"animaleyecare.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.animaleyecare.com/animalvision.html#vision |title=Animal Eye Care. \"About animal vision.\" Accessed March 11, 2010 |access-date=July 11, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428084014/http://www.animaleyecare.com/animalvision.html#vision |archive-date=April 28, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The horse uses its binocular vision by looking straight at an object, raising its head when it looks at a distant predator or focuses on an obstacle to jump.  To use binocular vision on a closer object near the ground, such as a snake or threat to its feet, the horse drops its nose and looks downward with its neck somewhat arched.\n\nA horse will raise or lower its head to increase its range of binocular vision.  A horse's visual field is lowered when it is asked to go \"on the bit\" with the head held perpendicular to the ground. This makes the horse's binocular vision focus less on distant objects and more on the immediate ground in front of the horse, suitable for arena distances, but less adaptive to a cross-country setting.  Riders who ride with their horses \"deep\", \"behind the vertical\", or in a [[rollkur]] frame decrease the range of the horse's distance vision even more, focusing only a few feet ahead of the front feet.  Riders of [[Show jumping|jumpers]]  take their horses' use of distance vision into consideration, allowing their horses to raise their heads a few strides before a jump, so the animals are able to assess the jumps and the proper take-off spots.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.horsewyse.com.au/howhorsessee.html |title=Horsewyse: How horses see.

Horse vision and the explanation of visual behaviour originally explained by the \u2018ramp retina\u2019. Equine Vet J 1999; 31(5):384\u2013390.</ref> Horses have better acuity when the objects they are looking at fall in this region. They therefore will tilt or raise their heads, to help place the objects within the area of the visual streak.\n\nThe horse is very sensitive to motion, as motion is usually the first alert that a predator is approaching.

Since only two-thirds of the eye can receive light, the receptor cells do not need to cover the entire interior of the eye, and line only the area from [[pupil]] to the [[optic disk]]. The part of the retina covered by light-sensitive cells is therefore termed the pars-optica retinae, and the blind part of the eye is termed the pars-ceaca retinae. The optic disk of the eye, however, does not contain any of these light-sensitive cells, as it is where the optic nerve leaves to the brain, so is a blind spot within the eye.<ref name=\"Riegal, Ronald J 2000\">Riegal, Ronald J.

The choroid has a great deal of pigment, and is almost entirely made of blood vessels. It forms the [[tapetum lucidum]] when it crosses over the [[fundus (eye)|fundus]] of the eye, causing the yellowish-green eye shine when light is directed into the animal's eyes at night. The tapetum lucidum reflects light back onto the retina, allowing for greater absorption in dark conditions. The iris lies between the cornea and the [[lens (anatomy)|lens]], and not only gives the eye its color, (''see \"eye color,\" below'') but also allows varying amounts of light to pass through its center hole, the [[pupil]].<ref name=\"Riegal, Ronald J 2000\"/> <!-- Line breaks break bulleted lists\n -->\n* The '''fibrous tunic''' consists of the [[sclera]] and [[cornea]] and protects the eye. The sclera (white of the eye) is made up of [[elastin]] and [[collagen]].

The opening between the two lids forms the palpebral tissue. The upper eyelid is larger and can move more than the lower lid. Unlike humans, horses also have a third eyelid ([[nictitating membrane]]) to protect the cornea. It lies on the inside corner of the eye, and closes diagonally over it.\n\nThe [[lacrimal apparatus]] produces tears, providing nutrition and moisture to the eye, as well as helping to remove any debris that may have entered. The apparatus includes the lacrimal gland and the accessory lacrimal gland, which produce the tears. Blinking spreads the fluid over the eye, before it drains via the [[nasolacrimal duct]], which carries the lacrimal fluid into the nostril of the horse.<ref name=\"Riegal, Ronald J 2000\"/>\n\nThe ocular muscles allow the eye to move within the skull.\n\n==Visual capacity of the horse==\n===Visual field===\n[[Image:Horse360.png|thumb|The range of a horse's monocular vision, blind spots are in shaded areas]]\n[[Image:DistanceHorse.png|thumb|A horse can use binocular vision to focus on distant objects by raising its head.]]\n[[Image:CollectedVision.png|thumb|A horse with the head held vertically will have binocular focus on objects near its feet.<ref>Miller, Robert W.

The horse's wide range of monocular vision has two \"blind spots,\" or areas where the animal cannot see: in front of the face, making a cone that comes to a point at about 90\u2013120&nbsp;cm (3\u20134&nbsp;ft) in front of the horse, and right behind its head, which extends over the back and behind the tail when standing with the head facing straight forward. Therefore, as a horse jumps an obstacle, it briefly disappears from sight right before the horse takes off.\n\nThe wide range of monocular vision has a trade-off:  The placement of the horse's eyes decreases the possible range of binocular vision to around 65\u00b0 on a horizontal plane, occurring in a triangular shape primarily in front of the horse's face.  Therefore, the horse has a smaller field of depth perception than a human.<ref name=\"animaleyecare.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.animaleyecare.com/animalvision.html#vision |title=Animal Eye Care. \"About animal vision.\" Accessed March 11, 2010 |access-date=July 11, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428084014/http://www.animaleyecare.com/animalvision.html#vision |archive-date=April 28, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The horse uses its binocular vision by looking straight at an object, raising its head when it looks at a distant predator or focuses on an obstacle to jump.  To use binocular vision on a closer object near the ground, such as a snake or threat to its feet, the horse drops its nose and looks downward with its neck somewhat arched.\n\nA horse will raise or lower its head to increase its range of binocular vision.  A horse's visual field is lowered when it is asked to go \"on the bit\" with the head held perpendicular to the ground. This makes the horse's binocular vision focus less on distant objects and more on the immediate ground in front of the horse, suitable for arena distances, but less adaptive to a cross-country setting.  Riders who ride with their horses \"deep\", \"behind the vertical\", or in a [[rollkur]] frame decrease the range of the horse's distance vision even more, focusing only a few feet ahead of the front feet.  Riders of [[Show jumping|jumpers]]  take their horses' use of distance vision into consideration, allowing their horses to raise their heads a few strides before a jump, so the animals are able to assess the jumps and the proper take-off spots.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.horsewyse.com.au/howhorsessee.html |title=Horsewyse: How horses see.

In the more narrow sense it refers to spinal [[osteoarthritis]], the age-related wear and tear of the spinal column, which is the most common cause of spondylosis. The degenerative process in osteoarthritis chiefly affects the vertebral bodies, the [[neural foramen|neural foramina]] and the [[facet joint]]s ([[facet syndrome]]). If severe, it may cause pressure on the [[spinal cord]] or [[nerve|nerve roots]] with subsequent [[sensory system|sensory]] or [[motor system|motor]] disturbances, such as [[pain]], [[paresthesia]], [[Balance (ability)|imbalance]], and [[muscle weakness]] in the limbs.\n\nWhen the space between two adjacent vertebrae narrows, compression of a nerve root emerging from the [[spinal cord]] may result in [[radiculopathy]] (sensory and motor disturbances, such as severe pain in the [[neck]], shoulder, arm, back, or leg, accompanied by muscle weakness).  Less commonly, direct pressure on the spinal cord (typically in the cervical spine) may result in [[myelopathy]], characterized by global weakness, gait dysfunction, loss of balance, and loss of bowel or bladder control. The patient may experience shocks (paresthesia) in hands and legs because of nerve compression and [[Ischemia|lack of blood flow]]. If vertebrae of the neck are involved it is labelled [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical]] spondylosis. Lower back spondylosis is labeled [[lumbar vertebrae|lumbar]] spondylosis. The term is from Ancient Greek \u03c3\u03c0\u03cc\u03bd\u03b4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 ''sp\u00f3ndylos'', \"a vertebra\", in plural \"vertebrae \u2013 the backbone\".\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n===Complications===\nA rare but severe complication of this disease is [[vertebrobasilar insufficiency]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Denis|first=Daniel|last2=Shedid|first2=Daniel|year=2014|title=Cervical spondylosis: a rare and curable cause of vertebrobasilar insufficiency|url=|journal=Eur Spine J|volume=23|pages=206\u201313|doi=10.1007/s00586-013-2983-2|pmid=24000075}}</ref> This is a result of the vertebral artery becoming occluded as it passes up in the transverse foramen. The spinal joints become stiff in cervical spondylosis. Thus the [[chondrocytes]] which maintain the disc become deprived of nutrition and die. Secondary [[osteophyte]]s may cause stenosis for [[spinal nerve]]s, manifesting as [[radiculopathy]].\n\n==Causes==\nSpondylosis is caused from years of constant abnormal pressure, caused by joint subluxation, stress induced by sports, acute and/or repetitive trauma, or poor posture, being placed on the vertebrae and the discs between them.  The abnormal stress causes the body to form new bone in order to compensate for the new weight distribution.  This abnormal weight bearing from bone displacement will cause spondylosis to occur.  Poor postures and loss of the normal spinal curves can lead to spondylosis as well.  Spondylosis can affect a person at any age; however, older people are more susceptible.<ref>Newman & Santiago, 2013{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:CT of spondylosis causing radiculopathy.png|thumb|[[CT scan]] of a man presenting with [[radiculopathy]] of the left [[cervical spinal nerve 7]].

The elimination format was the same as in the traditional competition: each week the worst couples were eliminated, the jury retained some of them, and in the finale the last two remaining went to the public vote.\n\nThe first show of the season  aired on August 24, 2009 as part of the original show, ''[[Showmatch]]'', broadcast on [[Canal 13 (Argentina)|El Trece]] and hosted by [[Marcelo Tinelli]]. 22 teams competed over a period of 18 weeks. The winner was revealed on the season finale, on December 17, 2009:  the dancer and model Silvina Escudero.\n\nThe panel of judges were the model, actress and [[vedette (cabaret)|vedette]] [[Graciela Alfano]], the director and choreographer [[Anibal Pachano]], actress and dancer [[Reina Reech]], and the singer [[Valeria Lynch]].\n\n== Contestants ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin:auto;\" font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!

In place of the traditional format of couples, each celebrity danced, sang and acted with a team of 5 dancers and one professional dancer. Each week they had to portray a different theme (love, fantasy, etc.). The elimination format was the same as in the traditional competition: each week the worst couples were eliminated, the jury retained some of them, and in the finale the last two remaining went to the public vote.\n\nThe first show of the season  aired on August 24, 2009 as part of the original show, ''[[Showmatch]]'', broadcast on [[Canal 13 (Argentina)|El Trece]] and hosted by [[Marcelo Tinelli]]. 22 teams competed over a period of 18 weeks. The winner was revealed on the season finale, on December 17, 2009:  the dancer and model Silvina Escudero.\n\nThe panel of judges were the model, actress and [[vedette (cabaret)|vedette]] [[Graciela Alfano]], the director and choreographer [[Anibal Pachano]], actress and dancer [[Reina Reech]], and the singer [[Valeria Lynch]].\n\n== Contestants ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin:auto;\" font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!
