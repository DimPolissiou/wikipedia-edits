In general, content was generated dynamically, allowing readers to comment directly on pages in a way that was not common previously.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nSome Web 2.0 capabilities were present in the days of Web 1.0, but were implemented differently.

During Web 1.0, server performance and bandwidth had to be considered\u2014lengthy comment threads on multiple pages could potentially slow down an entire site.

The Web will be understood not as screenfuls of text and graphics but as a transport mechanism, the ether through which interactivity happens. It will [...] appear on your computer screen, [...] on your TV set [...] your car dashboard [...] your cell phone [...] hand-held game machines [...] maybe even your microwave oven.\n}}\nWriting when [[Palm Inc.]] introduced its first web-capable [[personal digital assistant]] (supporting Web access with [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]]), DiNucci saw the Web \"fragmenting\" into a future that extended beyond the browser/PC combination it was identified with. She focused on how the basic information structure and hyper-linking mechanism introduced by [[HTTP]] would be used by a variety of devices and platforms. As such, her \"2.0\" designation refers to the next version of the Web that does not directly relate to the term's current use.\n\nThe term Web 2.0 did not resurface until 2002.<ref>Idehen, Kingsley. 2003.

The year of Web services. CIO, December 15.</ref> Kinsley and Eric focus on the concepts currently associated with the term where, as Scott Dietzen puts it, \"the Web becomes a universal, standards-based integration platform\".<ref name=\"Knorr, Eric 2003\"/> In 2004, the term began to popularize when O'Reilly Media and MediaLive hosted the first Web 2.0 conference. In their opening remarks, [[John Battelle]] and Tim O'Reilly outlined their definition of the \"Web as Platform\", where software applications are built upon the Web as opposed to upon the desktop. The unique aspect of this migration, they argued, is that \"customers are building your business for you\".<ref name=\"O'Reilly, Tim 2004\">O'Reilly, Tim, and John Battelle. 2004. Opening Welcome: State of the Internet Industry. In San Francisco, California, October 5.</ref> They argued that the activities of users generating content (in the form of ideas, text, videos, or pictures) could be \"harnessed\" to create value. O'Reilly and Battelle contrasted Web 2.0 with what they called \"Web 1.0\". They associated this term with the business models of [[Netscape]] and the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]. For example,\n{{quote|Netscape framed \"the web as platform\" in terms of the old software [[paradigm]]: their flagship product was the web browser, a desktop application, and their strategy was to use their dominance in the browser market to establish a market for high-priced server products. Control over standards for displaying content and applications in the browser would, in theory, give Netscape the kind of market power enjoyed by Microsoft in the PC market. Much like the \"horseless carriage\" framed the automobile as an extension of the familiar, Netscape promoted a \"webtop\" to replace the desktop, and planned to populate that webtop with information updates and applets pushed to the webtop by information providers who would purchase Netscape servers.<ref>O\u2019Reilly, T., 2005.</ref>}} In short, Netscape focused on creating software, releasing updates and bug fixes, and distributing it to the end users. O'Reilly contrasted this with [[Google]], a company that did not, at the time, focus on producing end-user software, but instead on providing a service based on data, such as the links that Web page authors make between sites. Google exploits this user-generated content to offer Web searches based on reputation through its \"[[PageRank]]\" algorithm. Unlike software, which undergoes scheduled releases, such services are constantly updated, a process called \"the [[perpetual beta]]\". A similar difference can be seen between the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] and [[Wikipedia]] \u2013 while the Britannica relies upon experts to write articles and release them periodically in publications, Wikipedia relies on trust in (sometimes anonymous) community members to constantly write and edit content. Wikipedia editors are not required to have educational credentials, such as degrees, in the subjects in which they are editing. Wikipedia is not based on subject-matter expertise, but rather on an adaptation of the [[Open-source software|open source]] software adage [[Linus' Law|\"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\"]]. This maxim is stating that if enough users are able to look at a software product's code (or a website), then these users will be able to fix any \"[[Bug (computing)|bugs]]\" or other problems. The Wikipedia volunteer editor community produces, edits, and updates articles constantly. O'Reilly's Web 2.0 conferences have been held every year since 2004, attracting [[entrepreneur]]s, representatives from large companies, tech experts and technology reporters.\n\nThe popularity of Web 2.0 was acknowledged by [[You (Time Person of the Year)|2006 ''TIME magazine'' Person of The Year]] (''You'').<ref>Grossman, Lev. 2006.

By increasing emphasis on these already-extant capabilities, they encourage users to rely more on their browser for [[user interface]], [[application software]] (\"apps\") and [[file storage]] facilities. This has been called \"network as platform\" computing.<ref name=\"oreilly\" /> Major features of Web 2.0 include [[social networking]] websites, self-publishing platforms (e.g., [[WordPress]]' easy-to-use blog and website creation tools), [[Tag (metadata)|\"tagging\"]] (which enables users to label websites, videos or photos in some fashion), [[Like button|\"like\" buttons]] (which enable a user to indicate that they are pleased by online content), and [[social bookmarking]].  \n\nUsers can provide the data and exercise some control over what they share on a Web 2.0 site.<ref name=\"oreilly\" /><ref name=\"hinchcliffe\">{{cite web\n|url=http://web2.wsj2.com/the_state_of_web_20.htm\n|title=The State of Web 2.0\n|publisher=Web Services\n|first = Dion | last = Hinchcliffe\n|date=2006-04-02\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515032339/http://web2.wsj2.com/the_state_of_web_20.htm\n|archivedate=2007-05-15\n|accessdate=2006-08-06\n}}</ref> These sites may have an \"architecture of participation\" that encourages users to add value to the application as they use it.<ref name=\"graham\" /><ref name=\"oreilly\" /> Users can add value in many ways, such as by commenting on news stories on a news website, by uploading a relevant photo on a travel website, or by adding a link to a video or [[TED talk]] which is pertinent to the subject being discussed on a website. Some scholars argue that [[cloud computing]] is an example of Web 2.0 because it is simply an implication of computing on the Internet.<ref>[SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=732483 Wireless Communications and Computing at a Crossroads: New Paradigms and Their Impact on Theories Governing the Public's Right to Spectrum Access], Patrick S.

Site users also typically create [[user-generated content]] for others to see (e.g., [[Wikipedia]], an online encyclopedia that anyone can write articles for or edit)\n# [[Software as a service]] (SaaS) \u2013 Web 2.0 sites developed [[API]]s to allow automated usage, such as by a [[Web app|Web \"app\"]] ([[software application]]) or a [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]]\n# [[Eternal September|Mass participation]] \u2013 near-universal web access leads to differentiation of concerns, from the traditional Internet user base (who tended to be [[hacker]]s and computer hobbyists) to a wider variety of users\n\n==Technologies==\nThe [[client-side]] ([[Web browser]]) technologies used in Web 2.0 development include [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] and [[JavaScript library|JavaScript frameworks]]. Ajax programming uses [[JavaScript]] and the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) to update selected regions of the page area without undergoing a full page reload. To allow users to continue interacting with the page, communications such as data requests going to the server are separated from data coming back to the page ([[Asynchronous communication|asynchronously]]). \n\nOtherwise, the user would have to routinely wait for the data to come back before they can do anything else on that page, just as a user has to wait for a page to complete the reload. This also increases the overall performance of the site, as the sending of requests can complete quicker independent of blocking and queueing required to send data back to the client. The data fetched by an Ajax request is typically formatted in [[XML]] or [[JSON]] (JavaScript Object Notation) format, two widely used [[structured data]] formats. Since both of these formats are natively understood by JavaScript, a programmer can easily use them to transmit structured data in their Web application. \n\nWhen this data is received via Ajax, the JavaScript program then uses the Document Object Model to dynamically update the Web page based on the new data, allowing for rapid and interactive user experience. In short, using these techniques, web designers can make their pages function like desktop applications. For example, [[Google Docs]] uses this technique to create a Web-based word processor.\n\nAs a widely available plug-in independent of [[W3C]] standards (the World Wide Web Consortium is the governing body of Web standards and protocols), [[Adobe Flash]] is capable of doing many things that were not possible pre-[[HTML5]]. Of Flash's many capabilities, the most commonly used is its ability to integrate streaming multimedia into HTML pages. With the introduction of HTML5 in 2010 and the growing concerns with Flash's security, the role of Flash is decreasing. \n\nIn addition to Flash and Ajax, JavaScript/Ajax frameworks have recently become a very popular means of creating Web 2.0 sites. At their core, these frameworks use the same technology as JavaScript, Ajax, and the DOM. However, frameworks smooth over inconsistencies between Web browsers and extend the functionality available to developers. Many of them also come with customizable, prefabricated '[[Software widget|widgets]]' that accomplish such common tasks as picking a date from a calendar, displaying a data chart, or making a tabbed panel. \n\nOn the [[Server side|server-side]], Web 2.0 uses many of the same technologies as Web 1.0. Languages such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], as well as [[J2EE|Enterprise Java (J2EE)]] and [[.NET Framework|Microsoft.NET Framework]], are used by developers to output data dynamically using information from files and databases. This allows websites and web services to share [[Machine-readable data|machine readable]] formats such as [[XML]] ([[Atom (standard)|Atom]], [[RSS]], etc.) and [[JSON]]. When data is available in one of these formats, another website can use it to [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|integrate a portion of that site's functionality]].\n\n==Concepts==\n[[File:Qualitydimensions.png|thumb|alt=Quality dimensions of web 2.0 portals, encyclopedias and Wikipedia|Quality dimensions of web 2.0 portals, [[encyclopedia|encyclopedias]] and [[Wikipedia]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lewoniewski |first1=W\u0142odzimierz |last2=W\u0119cel |first2=Krzysztof |last3=Abramowicz |first3=Witold |date=2019 |title=Multilingual Ranking of Wikipedia Articles with Quality and Popularity Assessment in Different Topics |journal=Computers |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=60 |doi=10.3390/computers8030060 }}</ref>]]\nWeb 2.0 can be described in three parts:\n* [[Rich Internet application]] (RIA)&nbsp;\u2014 defines the experience brought from desktop to browser, whether it is \"rich\" from a graphical point of view or a usability/interactivity or features point of view.\n* [[Web-oriented architecture]] (WOA)&nbsp;\u2014 defines how Web 2.0 applications expose their functionality so that other applications can leverage and integrate the functionality providing a set of much richer applications. Examples are [[Web feed|feeds]], [[RSS feed]]s, [[web services]], [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]].\n* [[Social Web]]&nbsp;\u2014 defines how Web 2.0 websites tend to interact much more with the end user and make the end user an integral part of the website, either by adding his or her profile, adding comments on content, uploading new content, or adding [[user-generated content]] (e.g., personal [[digital photo]]s).\n\nAs such, Web 2.0 draws together the capabilities of [[Client (computing)|client]]- and [[Server (computing)|server]]-side software, [[content syndication]] and the use of [[List of network protocols|network protocols]]. Standards-oriented Web browsers may use [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] and software extensions to handle the content and user interactions. Web 2.0 sites provide users with [[Computer data storage|information storage]], creation, and dissemination capabilities that were not possible in the environment known as \"Web 1.0\".\n\nWeb 2.0 sites include the following features and techniques, referred to as the acronym [[SLATES]] by Andrew McAfee:<ref>McAfee, A.

For example, in the Talis white paper \"Library 2.0: The Challenge of Disruptive Innovation\", [[Paul Miller (journalist)|Paul Miller]] argues\n\n<blockquote>Blogs, wikis and RSS are often held up as exemplary manifestations of Web 2.0. A reader of a blog or a wiki is provided with tools to add a comment or even, in the case of the wiki, to edit the content. This is what we call the Read/Write web. Talis believes that [[Library 2.0]] means harnessing this type of participation so that libraries can benefit from increasingly rich collaborative cataloging efforts, such as including contributions from partner libraries as well as adding rich enhancements, such as book jackets or movie files, to records from publishers and others.<ref>Miller 10\u201311</ref></blockquote>\n\nHere, Miller links Web 2.0 technologies and the culture of participation that they engender to the field of library science, supporting his claim that there is now a \"Library 2.0\". Many of the other proponents of new 2.0s mentioned here use similar methods. The meaning of Web 2.0 is role dependent. For example, some use Web 2.0 to establish and maintain relationships through social networks, while some marketing managers might use this promising technology to \"end-run traditionally unresponsive I.T. department[s].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web2.sys-con.com/node/207411 |title=i-Technology Viewpoint: It's Time to Take the Quotation Marks Off \"Web 2.0\" &#124; Web 2.0 Journal |publisher=Web2.sys-con.com |accessdate=2011-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216062850/http://web2.sys-con.com/node/207411 |archive-date=2011-02-16 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\nThere is a debate over the use of Web 2.0 technologies in mainstream education.

A growing number of marketers are using Web 2.0 tools to collaborate with consumers on product development, [[customer service]] enhancement, product or service improvement and promotion. Companies can use Web 2.0 tools to improve collaboration with both its business partners and consumers. Among other things, company employees have created wikis\u2014Web sites that allow users to add, delete, and edit content&nbsp;\u2014 to list answers to frequently asked questions about each product, and consumers have added significant contributions. \n\nAnother marketing Web 2.0 lure is to make sure consumers can use the online community to network among themselves on topics of their own choosing.<ref>\n{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122884677205091919 | title=The Secrets of Marketing in a Web 2.0 World | last=Parise | first=Salvatore | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date=2008-12-16 | access-date=2017-08-08 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710043624/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122884677205091919 | archive-date=2017-07-10 | url-status=live }}\n</ref> Mainstream media usage of Web 2.0 is increasing.

The brand of tourist destinations can be built through marketing campaigns on social media and by engaging with customers. For example, the \u201cSnow at First Sight\u201d campaign launched by the [[Colorado|State of Colorado]] aimed to bring brand awareness to Colorado as a winter destination. The campaign used social media platforms, for example, Facebook and Twitter, to promote this competition, and requested the participants to share experiences, pictures and videos on social media platforms. As a result, Colorado enhanced their image as a winter destination and created a campaign worth about $2.9 million.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe tourism organisation can earn brand royalty from interactive marketing campaigns on social media with engaging passive communication tactics. For example, \u201cMoms\u201d advisors of the [[Walt Disney World]] are responsible for offering suggestions and replying to questions about the family trips at Walt Disney World. Due to its characteristic of expertise in Disney, \u201cMoms\u201d was chosen to represent the campaign.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Simon|last2=Thal|first2=Karen|date=2013-01-01|title=The Impact of Social Media on the Consumer Decision Process: Implications for Tourism Marketing|journal=Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing|volume=30|issue=1\u20132|pages=156\u2013160|doi=10.1080/10548408.2013.751276|issn=1054-8408}}</ref> Social networking sites, such as Facebook, can be used as a platform for providing detailed information about the marketing campaign, as well as real-time online communication with customers.

[[WYSIWYG]] [[wiki]] and [[blog]]ging sites replicate many features of PC authoring applications. Several browser-based services have emerged, including [[EyeOS]]<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=https://techcrunch.com/2006/11/27/eyeos-open-source-webos-for-the-masses/\n|title=Can eyeOS Succeed Where Desktop.com Failed?\n|work=www.techcrunch.com\n|accessdate=2007-12-12\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212023338/http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/27/eyeos-open-source-webos-for-the-masses/\n|archive-date=2007-12-12\n|url-status=live\n}}\n</ref> and [[YouOS]].(No longer active.)<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2006/03/hey_youos.html\n|title=Tech Beat Hey YouOS!&nbsp;\u2013 BusinessWeek\n|publisher=www.businessweek.com\n|accessdate=2007-12-12\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217040221/http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2006/03/hey_youos.html\n|archive-date=2007-12-17\n|url-status=live\n}}\n</ref> Although named [[operating systems]], many of these services are application platforms. They mimic the user experience of desktop operating systems, offering features and applications similar to a PC environment, and are able to run within any modern browser. However, these so-called \"operating systems\" do not directly control the hardware on the client's computer. Numerous web-based application services appeared during the [[dot-com bubble]] of 1997\u20132001 and then vanished, having failed to gain a critical mass of customers.\n\n==Distribution of media==\n\n===XML and RSS===\nMany regard syndication of site content as a Web 2.0 feature. Syndication uses standardized protocols to permit end-users to make use of a site's data in another context (such as another Web site, a [[browser plugin]], or a separate desktop application). Protocols permitting syndication include [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] (really simple syndication, also known as Web syndication), [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] (as in RSS 1.1), and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]], all of which are [[XML]]-based formats. Observers have started to refer to these technologies as [[Web feed]]s. Specialized protocols such as [[FOAF (software)|FOAF]] and [[XHTML Friends Network|XFN]] (both for social networking) extend the functionality of sites and permit end-users to interact without centralized Web sites.\n\n===Web APIs===\n{{Main|Web API}}\nWeb 2.0 often uses machine-based interactions such as [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] and [[SOAP]]. Servers often expose proprietary [[Application programming interface]]s (API), but standard APIs (for example, for posting to a blog or notifying a blog update) have also come into use. Most communications through APIs involve XML or [[JSON]] payloads. REST APIs, through their use of self-descriptive messages and [[HATEOAS|hypermedia as the engine of application state]], should be self-describing once an entry [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] is known. [[Web Services Description Language]] (WSDL) is the standard way of publishing a SOAP Application programming interface and there are [[List of web service specifications|a range of Web service specifications]].\n\n==Criticism==\nCritics of the term claim that \"Web 2.0\" does not represent a new version of the [[World Wide Web]] at all, but merely continues to use so-called \"Web 1.0\" technologies and concepts.<ref name=\"developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee\" /> First, techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] do not replace underlying protocols like [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], but add a layer of abstraction on top of them. Second, many of the ideas of Web 2.0 were already featured in implementations on networked systems well before the term \"Web 2.0\" emerged. [[Amazon.com]], for instance, has allowed users to write reviews and consumer guides since its launch in 1995, in a form of self-publishing. Amazon also opened its API to outside developers in 2002.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Amazon Web Services API\n|work=O'Reilly Network\n|url=http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1707?wlg=yes\n|authorlink=Tim O'Reilly|first=Tim|last=O'Reilly\n|date=2002-06-18\n|accessdate=2006-05-27\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613235806/http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1707?wlg=yes\n|archivedate=2006-06-13\n}}</ref> Previous developments also came from research in [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning|computer-supported collaborative learning]] and [[computer supported cooperative work]] (CSCW) and from established products like [[Lotus Notes]] and [[Lotus Domino]], all phenomena that preceded Web 2.0. [[Tim Berners-Lee]], who developed the initial technologies of the Web, has been an outspoken critic of the term, while supporting many of the elements associated with it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2006/09/7650/|title=Tim Berners-Lee on Web 2.0: \"nobody even knows what it means\"|quote=He's big on blogs and wikis, and has nothing but good things to say about AJAX, but Berners-Lee faults the term \"Web 2.0\" for lacking any coherent meaning.|date=September 2006|access-date=2017-06-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708091023/https://arstechnica.com/business/2006/09/7650/|archive-date=2017-07-08|url-status=live}}</ref> In [[CERN|the environment where the Web originated]], each workstation had a [[dedicated IP address]] and always-on connection to the Internet.

For many people who work in software, version numbers like 2.0 and 3.0 are for [[software versioning]] or hardware versioning only, and to assign 2.0 arbitrarily to many technologies with a variety of real version numbers has no meaning.  The web does not have a version number.  For example, in a 2006 interview with [[IBM]] [[developerWorks]] podcast editor Scott Laningham, Tim Berners-Lee described the term \"Web 2.0\" as a jargon:<ref name=\"developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/dwi/cm-int082206txt.html |title=DeveloperWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee |date=2006-07-28 |accessdate=2012-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821185101/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/dwi/cm-int082206txt.html |archive-date=2012-08-21 |url-status=live }}\n</ref>\n<blockquote>\"Nobody really knows what it means... If Web 2.0 for you is blogs and wikis, then that is people to people. But that was what the Web was supposed to be all along... Web 2.0, for some people, it means moving some of the thinking [to the] client side, so making it more immediate, but the idea of the Web as interaction between people is really what the Web is. That was what it was designed to be... a collaborative space where people can interact.\"</blockquote> Other critics labeled Web 2.0 \"a second bubble\" (referring to the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 1997\u20132000), suggesting that too many Web 2.0 companies attempt to develop the same product with a lack of [[business model]]s. For example, ''[[The Economist]]'' has dubbed the mid- to late-2000s focus on Web companies as \"Bubble 2.0\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Bubble 2.0 |work=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_QQNVDDS |date=2005-12-22 |accessdate=2006-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119042722/http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_QQNVDDS |archive-date=2006-11-19 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n<!-- ... -->\n<!-- I commented this out as it has been proved invalid, actually wrong, due to subsequent events.

Keen's 2007 book, ''[[Cult of the Amateur]]'', argues that the core assumption of Web 2.0, that all opinions and user-generated content are equally valuable and relevant, is misguided. Additionally, ''[[Sunday Times]]'' reviewer John Flintoff has characterized Web 2.0 as \"creating an endless digital forest of mediocrity: uninformed political commentary, unseemly home videos, embarrassingly amateurish music, unreadable poems, essays and novels...

For instance, Twitter offers online tools for users to create their own tweet, in a way the users are doing all the work when it comes to producing media content. At the heart of Web 2.0's participatory culture is an inherent disregard for privacy, although it was not much of an issue for giant platforms like Facebook and Google, as users are discovering and exploring the internet because they want users to participate and create more content. More importantly, because user participation creates fresh content and profile data that are useful for third parties such as advertising corporates and national security. Therefore, suppression of privacy is built into the business model of Web 2.0 and one should not be too tied up to the optimistic notion of Web 2.0 being the next evolutionary step for digital media.\n\n==Trademark==\nIn November 2004, [[CMP Media]] applied to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] for a [[service mark]] on the use of the term \"WEB 2.0\" for live events.<ref name=\"uspto\">{{cite web |url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78322306 |title=USPTO serial number 78322306 |publisher=Tarr.uspto.gov |accessdate=2011-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113155427/http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78322306 |archive-date=2011-01-13 |url-status=live }}</ref> On the basis of this application, CMP Media sent a [[cease and desist|cease-and-desist]] demand to the Irish non-profit organisation IT@Cork on May 24, 2006,<ref>{{cite web |title=O'Reilly and CMP Exercise Trademark on 'Web 2.0' |work=Slashdot |url=http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/05/26/1238245 |date=2006-05-26 |accessdate=2006-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511040244/http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F05%2F26%2F1238245 |archive-date=2009-05-11 |url-status=live }}</ref> but retracted it two days later.<ref>{{cite web | title=O'Reilly's coverage of Web 2.0 as a service mark | work=O'Reilly Radar | url=http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/05/more_on_our_web_20_service_mar.html | first = Nathan | last = Torkington | date=2006-05-26 | accessdate=2006-06-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115224430/http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/05/more_on_our_web_20_service_mar.html|archivedate=15 January 2008}}</ref> The \"WEB 2.0\" service mark registration passed final PTO Examining Attorney review on May 10, 2006, and was registered on June 27, 2006.<ref name=\"uspto\"/> The [[European Union]] application (which would confer unambiguous status in Ireland)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oami.europa.eu/CTMOnline/RequestManager/en_Result?transition=ResultsDetailed&ntmark=&application=CTMOnline&bAdvanced=0&language=en&deno=&source=search_basic.jsp&idappli=004972212#|title=Application number 004972212|year=2007|access-date=2010-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512034116/http://oami.europa.eu/CTMOnline/RequestManager/en_Result?transition=ResultsDetailed&ntmark=&application=CTMOnline&bAdvanced=0&language=en&deno=&source=search_basic.jsp&idappli=004972212|archive-date=2013-05-12|url-status=live}}</ref> was declined on May 23, 2007.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Cloud computing]]\n* [[Collective intelligence]]\n* [[Connectivity (media)|Connectivity]] of social media\n* [[Crowd computing]]\n* [[Enterprise social software]]\n* [[Mass collaboration]]\n* [[New media]]\n* [[Office suite]]\n* [[Open source governance]]\n* [[Privacy issues of social networking sites]]\n* [[Social commerce]]\n* [[Social shopping]]\n* [[Web 2.0 for development]] (web2fordev)\n* [[Semantic Web#Web 3.0|Web 3.0]]\n* [[You (Time Person of the Year)]]\n* [[Libraries in Second Life]]\n* [[List of free software for Web 2.0 Services]]\n* [[Cute cat theory of digital activism]]\n\n; Application domains\n* [[Sci-Mate]]\n* [[Business 2.0]]\n* [[Learning 2.0|E-learning 2.0]]\n* [[e-Government]] (Government 2.0)\n* [[Health 2.0]]\n* [[Science 2.0]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Wikiversity-inline}}\n{{Scholia}}\n* {{cite book | title=Web 2.0 / Social Media / Social Networks|year=2017| publisher=MultiMedia| location=Charleston, South Carolina, SUA| isbn=978-1-544-63831-7}}\n\n{{Semantic Web}}\n\n[[Category:Web 2.0| ]]\n[[Category:2000s in computer science]]\n[[Category:Brand management]]\n[[Category:Cloud applications]]\n[[Category:Internet ages]]\n[[Category:Internet culture]]\n[[Category:New media]]\n[[Category:Social information processing]]\n[[Category:Technology neologisms]]\n[[Category:Web 2.0 neologisms| ]]\n[[Category:Web services]]\n[[Category:Words coined in the 2000s]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|World Wide Web sites that use technology beyond the static pages of earlier Web sites}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n\n[[File:Web 2.0 Map.svg|thumb|300px|A [[tag cloud]] (a typical Web 2.0 phenomenon in itself) presenting Web 2.0 themes]]\n\n'''Web 2.0''' (also known as '''Participative (or Participatory)'''<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blank|first=Grant|last2=Reisdorf|first2=Bianca|date=2012-05-01|title=The Participatory Web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263266131|journal=Information|volume=15|issue=4|pages=537\u2013554|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2012.665935}}</ref> and '''Social Web''')<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27960/web-10|title=What is Web 1.0?

She focused on how the basic information structure and hyper-linking mechanism introduced by [[HTTP]] would be used by a variety of devices and platforms. As such, her \"2.0\" designation refers to the next version of the Web that does not directly relate to the term's current use.\n\nThe term Web 2.0 did not resurface until 2002.<ref>Idehen, Kingsley. 2003.

The year of Web services. CIO, December 15.</ref> Kinsley and Eric focus on the concepts currently associated with the term where, as Scott Dietzen puts it, \"the Web becomes a universal, standards-based integration platform\".<ref name=\"Knorr, Eric 2003\"/> In 2004, the term began to popularize when O'Reilly Media and MediaLive hosted the first Web 2.0 conference. In their opening remarks, [[John Battelle]] and Tim O'Reilly outlined their definition of the \"Web as Platform\", where software applications are built upon the Web as opposed to upon the desktop. The unique aspect of this migration, they argued, is that \"customers are building your business for you\".<ref name=\"O'Reilly, Tim 2004\">O'Reilly, Tim, and John Battelle. 2004. Opening Welcome: State of the Internet Industry. In San Francisco, California, October 5.</ref> They argued that the activities of users generating content (in the form of ideas, text, videos, or pictures) could be \"harnessed\" to create value. O'Reilly and Battelle contrasted Web 2.0 with what they called \"Web 1.0\". They associated this term with the business models of [[Netscape]] and the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]. For example,\n{{quote|Netscape framed \"the web as platform\" in terms of the old software [[paradigm]]: their flagship product was the web browser, a desktop application, and their strategy was to use their dominance in the browser market to establish a market for high-priced server products. Control over standards for displaying content and applications in the browser would, in theory, give Netscape the kind of market power enjoyed by Microsoft in the PC market. Much like the \"horseless carriage\" framed the automobile as an extension of the familiar, Netscape promoted a \"webtop\" to replace the desktop, and planned to populate that webtop with information updates and applets pushed to the webtop by information providers who would purchase Netscape servers.<ref>O\u2019Reilly, T., 2005.</ref>}} In short, Netscape focused on creating software, releasing updates and bug fixes, and distributing it to the end users. O'Reilly contrasted this with [[Google]], a company that did not, at the time, focus on producing end-user software, but instead on providing a service based on data, such as the links that Web page authors make between sites. Google exploits this user-generated content to offer Web searches based on reputation through its \"[[PageRank]]\" algorithm. Unlike software, which undergoes scheduled releases, such services are constantly updated, a process called \"the [[perpetual beta]]\". A similar difference can be seen between the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] and [[Wikipedia]] \u2013 while the Britannica relies upon experts to write articles and release them periodically in publications, Wikipedia relies on trust in (sometimes anonymous) community members to constantly write and edit content. Wikipedia editors are not required to have educational credentials, such as degrees, in the subjects in which they are editing. Wikipedia is not based on subject-matter expertise, but rather on an adaptation of the [[Open-source software|open source]] software adage [[Linus' Law|\"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\"]]. This maxim is stating that if enough users are able to look at a software product's code (or a website), then these users will be able to fix any \"[[Bug (computing)|bugs]]\" or other problems. The Wikipedia volunteer editor community produces, edits, and updates articles constantly. O'Reilly's Web 2.0 conferences have been held every year since 2004, attracting [[entrepreneur]]s, representatives from large companies, tech experts and technology reporters.\n\nThe popularity of Web 2.0 was acknowledged by [[You (Time Person of the Year)|2006 ''TIME magazine'' Person of The Year]] (''You'').<ref>Grossman, Lev. 2006.

Some websites require users to contribute user-generated content to have access to the website, to discourage \"free riding\".[[File:Mass Effect Wiki Collaboration.png|thumb|A list of ways that people can volunteer to improve Mass Effect Wiki, an example of content generated by users working collaboratively.]]The key features of Web 2.0 include:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n# [[Folksonomy]] \u2013 free classification of information; allows users to collectively classify and find information (e.g. [[Tag (metadata)|\"tagging\"]] of websites, images, videos or links)\n# Rich [[user experience]] \u2013 dynamic content that is responsive to user input (e.g., a user can \"click\" on an image to enlarge it or find out more information)\n# [[Crowdsourcing|User participation]] \u2013 information flows two ways between the site owner and site users by means of evaluation, review, and online commenting. Site users also typically create [[user-generated content]] for others to see (e.g., [[Wikipedia]], an online encyclopedia that anyone can write articles for or edit)\n# [[Software as a service]] (SaaS) \u2013 Web 2.0 sites developed [[API]]s to allow automated usage, such as by a [[Web app|Web \"app\"]] ([[software application]]) or a [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]]\n# [[Eternal September|Mass participation]] \u2013 near-universal web access leads to differentiation of concerns, from the traditional Internet user base (who tended to be [[hacker]]s and computer hobbyists) to a wider variety of users\n\n==Technologies==\nThe [[client-side]] ([[Web browser]]) technologies used in Web 2.0 development include [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] and [[JavaScript library|JavaScript frameworks]]. Ajax programming uses [[JavaScript]] and the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) to update selected regions of the page area without undergoing a full page reload. To allow users to continue interacting with the page, communications such as data requests going to the server are separated from data coming back to the page ([[Asynchronous communication|asynchronously]]). \n\nOtherwise, the user would have to routinely wait for the data to come back before they can do anything else on that page, just as a user has to wait for a page to complete the reload. This also increases the overall performance of the site, as the sending of requests can complete quicker independent of blocking and queueing required to send data back to the client. The data fetched by an Ajax request is typically formatted in [[XML]] or [[JSON]] (JavaScript Object Notation) format, two widely used [[structured data]] formats. Since both of these formats are natively understood by JavaScript, a programmer can easily use them to transmit structured data in their Web application. \n\nWhen this data is received via Ajax, the JavaScript program then uses the Document Object Model to dynamically update the Web page based on the new data, allowing for rapid and interactive user experience. In short, using these techniques, web designers can make their pages function like desktop applications. For example, [[Google Docs]] uses this technique to create a Web-based word processor.\n\nAs a widely available plug-in independent of [[W3C]] standards (the World Wide Web Consortium is the governing body of Web standards and protocols), [[Adobe Flash]] is capable of doing many things that were not possible pre-[[HTML5]]. Of Flash's many capabilities, the most commonly used is its ability to integrate streaming multimedia into HTML pages. With the introduction of HTML5 in 2010 and the growing concerns with Flash's security, the role of Flash is decreasing. \n\nIn addition to Flash and Ajax, JavaScript/Ajax frameworks have recently become a very popular means of creating Web 2.0 sites. At their core, these frameworks use the same technology as JavaScript, Ajax, and the DOM. However, frameworks smooth over inconsistencies between Web browsers and extend the functionality available to developers. Many of them also come with customizable, prefabricated '[[Software widget|widgets]]' that accomplish such common tasks as picking a date from a calendar, displaying a data chart, or making a tabbed panel. \n\nOn the [[Server side|server-side]], Web 2.0 uses many of the same technologies as Web 1.0. Languages such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], as well as [[J2EE|Enterprise Java (J2EE)]] and [[.NET Framework|Microsoft.NET Framework]], are used by developers to output data dynamically using information from files and databases. This allows websites and web services to share [[Machine-readable data|machine readable]] formats such as [[XML]] ([[Atom (standard)|Atom]], [[RSS]], etc.) and [[JSON]]. When data is available in one of these formats, another website can use it to [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|integrate a portion of that site's functionality]].\n\n==Concepts==\n[[File:Qualitydimensions.png|thumb|alt=Quality dimensions of web 2.0 portals, encyclopedias and Wikipedia|Quality dimensions of web 2.0 portals, [[encyclopedia|encyclopedias]] and [[Wikipedia]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lewoniewski |first1=W\u0142odzimierz |last2=W\u0119cel |first2=Krzysztof |last3=Abramowicz |first3=Witold |date=2019 |title=Multilingual Ranking of Wikipedia Articles with Quality and Popularity Assessment in Different Topics |journal=Computers |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=60 |doi=10.3390/computers8030060 }}</ref>]]\nWeb 2.0 can be described in three parts:\n* [[Rich Internet application]] (RIA)&nbsp;\u2014 defines the experience brought from desktop to browser, whether it is \"rich\" from a graphical point of view or a usability/interactivity or features point of view.\n* [[Web-oriented architecture]] (WOA)&nbsp;\u2014 defines how Web 2.0 applications expose their functionality so that other applications can leverage and integrate the functionality providing a set of much richer applications. Examples are [[Web feed|feeds]], [[RSS feed]]s, [[web services]], [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]].\n* [[Social Web]]&nbsp;\u2014 defines how Web 2.0 websites tend to interact much more with the end user and make the end user an integral part of the website, either by adding his or her profile, adding comments on content, uploading new content, or adding [[user-generated content]] (e.g., personal [[digital photo]]s).\n\nAs such, Web 2.0 draws together the capabilities of [[Client (computing)|client]]- and [[Server (computing)|server]]-side software, [[content syndication]] and the use of [[List of network protocols|network protocols]]. Standards-oriented Web browsers may use [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] and software extensions to handle the content and user interactions. Web 2.0 sites provide users with [[Computer data storage|information storage]], creation, and dissemination capabilities that were not possible in the environment known as \"Web 1.0\".\n\nWeb 2.0 sites include the following features and techniques, referred to as the acronym [[SLATES]] by Andrew McAfee:<ref>McAfee, A.

[[Wiki]] users may extend, undo, redo and edit each other's work. Comment systems allow readers to contribute their viewpoints.\n; '''T'''ags\n: Categorization of content by users adding \"tags\"&nbsp;\u2014 short, usually one-word or two-word descriptions&nbsp;\u2014 to facilitate searching. For example, a user can tag a metal song as \"[[death metal]]\". Collections of tags created by many users within a single system may be referred to as \"folksonomies\" (i.e., [[Folk taxonomy|folk]] [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]]).\n; '''E'''xtensions\n: Software that makes the Web an [[application platform]] as well as a document server. Examples include [[Adobe Reader]], [[Adobe Flash]], [[Microsoft Silverlight]], [[ActiveX]], [[Java programming language|Oracle Java]], [[QuickTime]], and [[Windows Media]].\n; Signals\n: The use of syndication technology, such as [[RSS]] feeds to notify users of content changes.\n\nWhile SLATES forms the basic framework of Enterprise 2.0, it does not contradict all of the higher level Web 2.0 design patterns and business models. It includes discussions of self-service IT, the long tail of enterprise IT demand, and many other consequences of the Web 2.0 era in enterprise uses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=71 |title=Web 2.0 definition updated and Enterprise 2.0 emerges |last=Hinchcliffe |first=Dion |date=November 5, 2006 |website=ZDNet blogs |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129225858/http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=71 |archivedate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nDocuments of Web 2.0 can be assessed by [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]] related to such [[data quality|quality]] dimension as [[Web accessibility|accessibility]], [[Completeness (knowledge bases)|completeness]], [[credibility]], involvement, [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]], [[readability]], [[relevance]], [[reputation]], [[Writing style|style]], timeliness, uniqueness and usefulness<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lewoniewski |first1=W\u0142odzimierz |date=2019-01-03 |title=Measures for Quality Assessment of Articles and Infoboxes in Multilingual Wikipedia |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330087836 |journal=Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing |volume=339 |issue= |pages=619\u2013633 |doi=10.1007/978-3-030-04849-5_53|isbn=978-3-030-04848-8 }}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nA third important part of Web 2.0 is the [[social web]]. The social Web consists of a number of online tools and platforms where people share their perspectives, opinions, thoughts and experiences.

For example, in the Talis white paper \"Library 2.0: The Challenge of Disruptive Innovation\", [[Paul Miller (journalist)|Paul Miller]] argues\n\n<blockquote>Blogs, wikis and RSS are often held up as exemplary manifestations of Web 2.0. A reader of a blog or a wiki is provided with tools to add a comment or even, in the case of the wiki, to edit the content. This is what we call the Read/Write web. Talis believes that [[Library 2.0]] means harnessing this type of participation so that libraries can benefit from increasingly rich collaborative cataloging efforts, such as including contributions from partner libraries as well as adding rich enhancements, such as book jackets or movie files, to records from publishers and others.<ref>Miller 10\u201311</ref></blockquote>\n\nHere, Miller links Web 2.0 technologies and the culture of participation that they engender to the field of library science, supporting his claim that there is now a \"Library 2.0\". Many of the other proponents of new 2.0s mentioned here use similar methods. The meaning of Web 2.0 is role dependent. For example, some use Web 2.0 to establish and maintain relationships through social networks, while some marketing managers might use this promising technology to \"end-run traditionally unresponsive I.T. department[s].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web2.sys-con.com/node/207411 |title=i-Technology Viewpoint: It's Time to Take the Quotation Marks Off \"Web 2.0\" &#124; Web 2.0 Journal |publisher=Web2.sys-con.com |accessdate=2011-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216062850/http://web2.sys-con.com/node/207411 |archive-date=2011-02-16 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\nThere is a debate over the use of Web 2.0 technologies in mainstream education.

A growing number of marketers are using Web 2.0 tools to collaborate with consumers on product development, [[customer service]] enhancement, product or service improvement and promotion. Companies can use Web 2.0 tools to improve collaboration with both its business partners and consumers. Among other things, company employees have created wikis\u2014Web sites that allow users to add, delete, and edit content&nbsp;\u2014 to list answers to frequently asked questions about each product, and consumers have added significant contributions. \n\nAnother marketing Web 2.0 lure is to make sure consumers can use the online community to network among themselves on topics of their own choosing.<ref>\n{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122884677205091919 | title=The Secrets of Marketing in a Web 2.0 World | last=Parise | first=Salvatore | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date=2008-12-16 | access-date=2017-08-08 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710043624/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122884677205091919 | archive-date=2017-07-10 | url-status=live }}\n</ref> Mainstream media usage of Web 2.0 is increasing.

The brand of tourist destinations can be built through marketing campaigns on social media and by engaging with customers. For example, the \u201cSnow at First Sight\u201d campaign launched by the [[Colorado|State of Colorado]] aimed to bring brand awareness to Colorado as a winter destination. The campaign used social media platforms, for example, Facebook and Twitter, to promote this competition, and requested the participants to share experiences, pictures and videos on social media platforms. As a result, Colorado enhanced their image as a winter destination and created a campaign worth about $2.9 million.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe tourism organisation can earn brand royalty from interactive marketing campaigns on social media with engaging passive communication tactics. For example, \u201cMoms\u201d advisors of the [[Walt Disney World]] are responsible for offering suggestions and replying to questions about the family trips at Walt Disney World. Due to its characteristic of expertise in Disney, \u201cMoms\u201d was chosen to represent the campaign.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Simon|last2=Thal|first2=Karen|date=2013-01-01|title=The Impact of Social Media on the Consumer Decision Process: Implications for Tourism Marketing|journal=Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing|volume=30|issue=1\u20132|pages=156\u2013160|doi=10.1080/10548408.2013.751276|issn=1054-8408}}</ref> Social networking sites, such as Facebook, can be used as a platform for providing detailed information about the marketing campaign, as well as real-time online communication with customers.

[[WYSIWYG]] [[wiki]] and [[blog]]ging sites replicate many features of PC authoring applications. Several browser-based services have emerged, including [[EyeOS]]<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=https://techcrunch.com/2006/11/27/eyeos-open-source-webos-for-the-masses/\n|title=Can eyeOS Succeed Where Desktop.com Failed?\n|work=www.techcrunch.com\n|accessdate=2007-12-12\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212023338/http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/27/eyeos-open-source-webos-for-the-masses/\n|archive-date=2007-12-12\n|url-status=live\n}}\n</ref> and [[YouOS]].(No longer active.)<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2006/03/hey_youos.html\n|title=Tech Beat Hey YouOS!&nbsp;\u2013 BusinessWeek\n|publisher=www.businessweek.com\n|accessdate=2007-12-12\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217040221/http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2006/03/hey_youos.html\n|archive-date=2007-12-17\n|url-status=live\n}}\n</ref> Although named [[operating systems]], many of these services are application platforms. They mimic the user experience of desktop operating systems, offering features and applications similar to a PC environment, and are able to run within any modern browser. However, these so-called \"operating systems\" do not directly control the hardware on the client's computer. Numerous web-based application services appeared during the [[dot-com bubble]] of 1997\u20132001 and then vanished, having failed to gain a critical mass of customers.\n\n==Distribution of media==\n\n===XML and RSS===\nMany regard syndication of site content as a Web 2.0 feature. Syndication uses standardized protocols to permit end-users to make use of a site's data in another context (such as another Web site, a [[browser plugin]], or a separate desktop application). Protocols permitting syndication include [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] (really simple syndication, also known as Web syndication), [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] (as in RSS 1.1), and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]], all of which are [[XML]]-based formats. Observers have started to refer to these technologies as [[Web feed]]s. Specialized protocols such as [[FOAF (software)|FOAF]] and [[XHTML Friends Network|XFN]] (both for social networking) extend the functionality of sites and permit end-users to interact without centralized Web sites.\n\n===Web APIs===\n{{Main|Web API}}\nWeb 2.0 often uses machine-based interactions such as [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] and [[SOAP]]. Servers often expose proprietary [[Application programming interface]]s (API), but standard APIs (for example, for posting to a blog or notifying a blog update) have also come into use. Most communications through APIs involve XML or [[JSON]] payloads. REST APIs, through their use of self-descriptive messages and [[HATEOAS|hypermedia as the engine of application state]], should be self-describing once an entry [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] is known. [[Web Services Description Language]] (WSDL) is the standard way of publishing a SOAP Application programming interface and there are [[List of web service specifications|a range of Web service specifications]].\n\n==Criticism==\nCritics of the term claim that \"Web 2.0\" does not represent a new version of the [[World Wide Web]] at all, but merely continues to use so-called \"Web 1.0\" technologies and concepts.<ref name=\"developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee\" /> First, techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] do not replace underlying protocols like [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], but add a layer of abstraction on top of them. Second, many of the ideas of Web 2.0 were already featured in implementations on networked systems well before the term \"Web 2.0\" emerged. [[Amazon.com]], for instance, has allowed users to write reviews and consumer guides since its launch in 1995, in a form of self-publishing. Amazon also opened its API to outside developers in 2002.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Amazon Web Services API\n|work=O'Reilly Network\n|url=http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1707?wlg=yes\n|authorlink=Tim O'Reilly|first=Tim|last=O'Reilly\n|date=2002-06-18\n|accessdate=2006-05-27\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613235806/http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1707?wlg=yes\n|archivedate=2006-06-13\n}}</ref> Previous developments also came from research in [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning|computer-supported collaborative learning]] and [[computer supported cooperative work]] (CSCW) and from established products like [[Lotus Notes]] and [[Lotus Domino]], all phenomena that preceded Web 2.0.

For many people who work in software, version numbers like 2.0 and 3.0 are for [[software versioning]] or hardware versioning only, and to assign 2.0 arbitrarily to many technologies with a variety of real version numbers has no meaning.  The web does not have a version number.  For example, in a 2006 interview with [[IBM]] [[developerWorks]] podcast editor Scott Laningham, Tim Berners-Lee described the term \"Web 2.0\" as a jargon:<ref name=\"developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/dwi/cm-int082206txt.html |title=DeveloperWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee |date=2006-07-28 |accessdate=2012-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821185101/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/dwi/cm-int082206txt.html |archive-date=2012-08-21 |url-status=live }}\n</ref>\n<blockquote>\"Nobody really knows what it means... If Web 2.0 for you is blogs and wikis, then that is people to people. But that was what the Web was supposed to be all along... Web 2.0, for some people, it means moving some of the thinking [to the] client side, so making it more immediate, but the idea of the Web as interaction between people is really what the Web is. That was what it was designed to be... a collaborative space where people can interact.\"</blockquote> Other critics labeled Web 2.0 \"a second bubble\" (referring to the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 1997\u20132000), suggesting that too many Web 2.0 companies attempt to develop the same product with a lack of [[business model]]s. For example, ''[[The Economist]]'' has dubbed the mid- to late-2000s focus on Web companies as \"Bubble 2.0\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Bubble 2.0 |work=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_QQNVDDS |date=2005-12-22 |accessdate=2006-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119042722/http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_QQNVDDS |archive-date=2006-11-19 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n<!-- ... -->\n<!-- I commented this out as it has been proved invalid, actually wrong, due to subsequent events.

Keen's 2007 book, ''[[Cult of the Amateur]]'', argues that the core assumption of Web 2.0, that all opinions and user-generated content are equally valuable and relevant, is misguided. Additionally, ''[[Sunday Times]]'' reviewer John Flintoff has characterized Web 2.0 as \"creating an endless digital forest of mediocrity: uninformed political commentary, unseemly home videos, embarrassingly amateurish music, unreadable poems, essays and novels... [and that Wikipedia is full of] mistakes, half-truths and misunderstandings\".<ref>{{cite news | title=Thinking is so over | url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/personal_tech/article1874668.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=JohnPaul | last=Flintoff | date=2007-06-03 | access-date=2009-06-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507212657/http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/personal_tech/article1874668.ece | archive-date=2009-05-07 | url-status=live }}</ref> In a 1994 ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' interview, [[Steve Jobs]], forecasting the future development of the web for personal publishing, said \"The Web is great because that person can't foist anything on you-you have to go get it.

For instance, Twitter offers online tools for users to create their own tweet, in a way the users are doing all the work when it comes to producing media content. At the heart of Web 2.0's participatory culture is an inherent disregard for privacy, although it was not much of an issue for giant platforms like Facebook and Google, as users are discovering and exploring the internet because they want users to participate and create more content. More importantly, because user participation creates fresh content and profile data that are useful for third parties such as advertising corporates and national security. Therefore, suppression of privacy is built into the business model of Web 2.0 and one should not be too tied up to the optimistic notion of Web 2.0 being the next evolutionary step for digital media.\n\n==Trademark==\nIn November 2004, [[CMP Media]] applied to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] for a [[service mark]] on the use of the term \"WEB 2.0\" for live events.<ref name=\"uspto\">{{cite web |url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78322306 |title=USPTO serial number 78322306 |publisher=Tarr.uspto.gov |accessdate=2011-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113155427/http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78322306 |archive-date=2011-01-13 |url-status=live }}</ref> On the basis of this application, CMP Media sent a [[cease and desist|cease-and-desist]] demand to the Irish non-profit organisation IT@Cork on May 24, 2006,<ref>{{cite web |title=O'Reilly and CMP Exercise Trademark on 'Web 2.0' |work=Slashdot |url=http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/05/26/1238245 |date=2006-05-26 |accessdate=2006-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511040244/http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F05%2F26%2F1238245 |archive-date=2009-05-11 |url-status=live }}</ref> but retracted it two days later.<ref>{{cite web | title=O'Reilly's coverage of Web 2.0 as a service mark | work=O'Reilly Radar | url=http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/05/more_on_our_web_20_service_mar.html | first = Nathan | last = Torkington | date=2006-05-26 | accessdate=2006-06-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115224430/http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/05/more_on_our_web_20_service_mar.html|archivedate=15 January 2008}}</ref> The \"WEB 2.0\" service mark registration passed final PTO Examining Attorney review on May 10, 2006, and was registered on June 27, 2006.<ref name=\"uspto\"/> The [[European Union]] application (which would confer unambiguous status in Ireland)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oami.europa.eu/CTMOnline/RequestManager/en_Result?transition=ResultsDetailed&ntmark=&application=CTMOnline&bAdvanced=0&language=en&deno=&source=search_basic.jsp&idappli=004972212#|title=Application number 004972212|year=2007|access-date=2010-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512034116/http://oami.europa.eu/CTMOnline/RequestManager/en_Result?transition=ResultsDetailed&ntmark=&application=CTMOnline&bAdvanced=0&language=en&deno=&source=search_basic.jsp&idappli=004972212|archive-date=2013-05-12|url-status=live}}</ref> was declined on May 23, 2007.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Cloud computing]]\n* [[Collective intelligence]]\n* [[Connectivity (media)|Connectivity]] of social media\n* [[Crowd computing]]\n* [[Enterprise social software]]\n* [[Mass collaboration]]\n* [[New media]]\n* [[Office suite]]\n* [[Open source governance]]\n* [[Privacy issues of social networking sites]]\n* [[Social commerce]]\n* [[Social shopping]]\n* [[Web 2.0 for development]] (web2fordev)\n* [[Semantic Web#Web 3.0|Web 3.0]]\n* [[You (Time Person of the Year)]]\n* [[Libraries in Second Life]]\n* [[List of free software for Web 2.0 Services]]\n* [[Cute cat theory of digital activism]]\n\n; Application domains\n* [[Sci-Mate]]\n* [[Business 2.0]]\n* [[Learning 2.0|E-learning 2.0]]\n* [[e-Government]] (Government 2.0)\n* [[Health 2.0]]\n* [[Science 2.0]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Wikiversity-inline}}\n{{Scholia}}\n* {{cite book | title=Web 2.0 / Social Media / Social Networks|year=2017| publisher=MultiMedia| location=Charleston, South Carolina, SUA| isbn=978-1-544-63831-7}}\n\n{{Semantic Web}}\n\n[[Category:Web 2.0| ]]\n[[Category:2000s in computer science]]\n[[Category:Brand management]]\n[[Category:Cloud applications]]\n[[Category:Internet ages]]\n[[Category:Internet culture]]\n[[Category:New media]]\n[[Category:Social information processing]]\n[[Category:Technology neologisms]]\n[[Category:Web 2.0 neologisms| ]]\n[[Category:Web services]]\n[[Category:Words coined in the 2000s]]\n", "name_user": "43.252.15.247", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0"}

The theoretical complexity of the problem is a significant factor in the development of various software solutions. This is because systems must take into account many different forms of schedules that could be worked, and allocate employees to the correct schedule.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = N. | last2 = Patten | first2 = L. | year = 2005 | title = Shoring Up for Efficiency | url = | journal = Health Management Technology | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 34\u201336 }}</ref> Ultimately, optimization of scheduling is to minimize costs, but also often requires a reciprocal approach from management instead of complete reliance on software.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Transitioning to employee scheduling software ==\nPrior to employee scheduling software companies would use physical mediums for tracking employee hours and work schedule. This then gave rise to data storage forms that later by the 80s were compatible with computer programs and software. These forms however never actually scheduled the employees, it just kept track of the employees work week, hours, and prior work schedules. This then gave way to the idea of employee scheduling software, which would be an all-inclusive system that would store and track employee work history, along with actually scheduling the employee's work week.\n\n===Punch cards===\n\nThe earliest form of automated employee scheduling and managing of employee hours was the Punch Card. The idea first created by Basile Bouchon developed the control of a loom by punched holes in paper tape in 1725. [[Herman Hollerith]] improved the design.<ref>Trogemann, Georg (eds.); et al. (2001). Computing in Russia. Verlag. pp. 47\u201349. The article is by Gellius N. Povarov, titled Semen Nikolayevich Korsakov- Machines for the Comparison of Philosophical Ideas</ref> IBM manufactured and marketed a variety of unit record machines for creating, sorting, and tabulating punched cards, even after expanding into electronic computers in the late 1950s. IBM developed punched card technology into a powerful tool for business data-processing and produced an extensive line of general purpose unit record machines.<ref>Essinger, James (2004). Jacquard's Web: How a hand-loom led to the birth of the information age. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280577-0}}.</ref>\n\n===Magnetic tape===\n\nDuring the 1960s, the punched card was gradually replaced as the primary means for data storage by magnetic tape, as better, more capable computers became available. Mohawk Data Sciences introduced a magnetic tape encoder in 1965, a system marketed as a keypunch replacement which was somewhat successful, but punched cards were still commonly used for data entry and programming until the mid-1980s when the combination of lower cost magnetic disk storage, and affordable interactive terminals on less expensive minicomputers made punched cards obsolete for this role as well.<ref>Aspray (ed.), W.

In the last decade, many software solutions have sprung up to make the lives of business owners and managers easier and less burdensome.\n\nThe first wave of solutions helped small business owners to schedule, manage, and communicate with their employees in a more streamlined way. The newer way of solutions go a step further, leveraging machine learning and are being built on even newer cloud technologies.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The need for automation and intelligent rostering in workforce management will continue to grow as society's heads into a gig economy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naco.org/featured-resources/future-work-rise-gig-economy|title=The Future of Work: The Rise of the Gig Economy|website=NACo|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}</ref>\n\n== Complexity ==\nAlgorithms are used within the employee scheduling software in order to determine not only who is working, but also the specific jobs and tasks required of the workers. The system still must be monitored, and any further issues with assigning of specifics is done manually.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Robidoux | first1 = L. | last2 = Donnelly | first2 = P. | year = 2011 | title = Automated employee scheduling: Welcome to the future | url = | journal = Nursing Management | volume = 42 | issue = 12| pages = 41\u201343 | doi = 10.1097/01.NUMA.0000407580.30932.ce }}</ref> Within the context of roster problems and models, there are three main factors to work out the differences: the integration of days off scheduling with line of work construction and task assignment, roster construction, and demand type.<ref name=\":0\" /> These complexities thusly require that each and every workplace must optimize employee scheduling software based off their own unique set of rules, issues and needs.<ref name=\":3\" /> Additionally, it is difficult to determine optimal solution that minimize costs, meet employee preferences, distribute shifts equitably among employees and satisfy all the workplace constraints. In many organizations, the people involved in developing rosters need decisions support tools to help provide the right employees at the right time and the right cost while achieving a high level of employee satisfaction.<ref name=\":0\" /> Due to constant change within work environments, new models and algorithms must be created in order to allow for flexibility as needs and demands arise. For example, when a large number of new employees are hired, as in the total workforce is increased, the scheduling software likely will need to be updated in order to allow for such a change.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Features==\nAlthough employee scheduling software won't necessarily improve [[business practices]] by itself, it does automate typically tedious business administration.

The theoretical complexity of the problem is a significant factor in the development of various software solutions. This is because systems must take into account many different forms of schedules that could be worked, and allocate employees to the correct schedule.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = N. | last2 = Patten | first2 = L. | year = 2005 | title = Shoring Up for Efficiency | url = | journal = Health Management Technology | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 34\u201336 }}</ref> Ultimately, optimization of scheduling is to minimize costs, but also often requires a reciprocal approach from management instead of complete reliance on software.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Transitioning to employee scheduling software ==\nPrior to employee scheduling software companies would use physical mediums for tracking employee hours and work schedule. This then gave rise to data storage forms that later by the 80s were compatible with computer programs and software. These forms however never actually scheduled the employees, it just kept track of the employees work week, hours, and prior work schedules. This then gave way to the idea of employee scheduling software, which would be an all-inclusive system that would store and track employee work history, along with actually scheduling the employee's work week.\n\n===Punch cards===\n\nThe earliest form of automated employee scheduling and managing of employee hours was the Punch Card. The idea first created by Basile Bouchon developed the control of a loom by punched holes in paper tape in 1725. [[Herman Hollerith]] improved the design.<ref>Trogemann, Georg (eds.); et al. (2001). Computing in Russia. Verlag. pp. 47\u201349. The article is by Gellius N. Povarov, titled Semen Nikolayevich Korsakov- Machines for the Comparison of Philosophical Ideas</ref> IBM manufactured and marketed a variety of unit record machines for creating, sorting, and tabulating punched cards, even after expanding into electronic computers in the late 1950s. IBM developed punched card technology into a powerful tool for business data-processing and produced an extensive line of general purpose unit record machines.<ref>Essinger, James (2004). Jacquard's Web: How a hand-loom led to the birth of the information age. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280577-0}}.</ref>\n\n===Magnetic tape===\n\nDuring the 1960s, the punched card was gradually replaced as the primary means for data storage by magnetic tape, as better, more capable computers became available. Mohawk Data Sciences introduced a magnetic tape encoder in 1965, a system marketed as a keypunch replacement which was somewhat successful, but punched cards were still commonly used for data entry and programming until the mid-1980s when the combination of lower cost magnetic disk storage, and affordable interactive terminals on less expensive minicomputers made punched cards obsolete for this role as well.<ref>Aspray (ed.), W.

In the last decade, many software solutions have sprung up to make the lives of business owners and managers easier and less burdensome.\n\nThe first wave of solutions helped small business owners to schedule, manage, and communicate with their employees in a more streamlined way. The newer way of solutions go a step further, leveraging machine learning and are being built on even newer cloud technologies.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The need for automation and intelligent rostering in workforce management will continue to grow as society's heads into a gig economy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.naco.org/featured-resources/future-work-rise-gig-economy|title=The Future of Work: The Rise of the Gig Economy|website=NACo|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}</ref>\n\n== Complexity ==\nAlgorithms are used within the employee scheduling software in order to determine not only who is working, but also the specific jobs and tasks required of the workers.

In many organizations, the people involved in developing rosters need decisions support tools to help provide the right employees at the right time and the right cost while achieving a high level of employee satisfaction.<ref name=\":0\" /> Due to constant change within work environments, new models and algorithms must be created in order to allow for flexibility as needs and demands arise.

They leave together from the bar and decide to spend the night together at Veer's home but Veer stops Zoe from continuing their act. He tells her that the time is not right. Zoe leaves, infuriated. Veer keeps following Zoe, who finally confronts him and asks him not to follow her. \n\nThere is a flashback scene where Leena and Raghuvendra \"Raghu\" Singh have the same conversation back in the 1990s in Udaipur.\n\nBack to present day, Veer drops her for an interview at the office of the Mehta Group and they slowly begin their relationship. The group's owner, Raj Mehta, also owns the place where Zoe hangs out very often. Raj, who is good friends with Zoe, tells her the story of his childhood sweetheart, Leena, thus implying that he is a grown up Raghu. He tells her that he used to behave with Leena just as Veer behaves with Zoe, and recites his own childhood memories with Leena to Zoe and tells her how he asked Leena for a dance together.\n\nIn the flashback, it is seen that Raghu and Leena used to meet each other secretly and how Raghu left everything for Leena and moved for her to Delhi, discotinuing his studies to be with Leena. Zoe walks in on Raj and his wife, assuming she is Leena, but realizes it's not the case. Raj reveals that he left Leena. Zoe is convinced by her mother that she can't possibly have both her love and career together. She goes to meet Veer's parents, but leaves crying. Veer relays to Raj what Zoe did, and Raj, convinced that he influenced Zoe towards behaving this way, responds by getting her the job. \n\nSome days later, Zoe sees Veer with another girl. Heartbroken, she hangs out with multiple people but doesn't happen to like any of them. She goes to a bar with a guy and gets drunk but he refuses to drop her at her home. Veer picks her and drops at her house. He tells that he can't enter a relationship of compromises with Zoe and breaks up with her. The next day he informs her about a new job in the Himalayas and is leaving for 2 years, explaining that he has as much right to be focused on his career as does she, and bids her goodbye. Zoe gets a proposal from the Mehta family to marry Raj, but refuses. He, in turn, tells that he met Leena one last time, when he realized she was pregnant. He starts crying and Zoe comforts him. Raj tells her that she shouldn't make the same mistake he made. Zoe leaves for the Himalayas to reunite with Veer. She sees Veer sleeping outside. She goes and rests atop him. Veer asks whether she will take a leap with him, to which she agrees, and they reunite.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Kartik Aaryan]] as Veer Srivastava / Raghuvendra \"Raghu\" Singh<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/features/meet-kartik-aaryan-veer-raghu-imtiaz-alis-love-aaj-kal/|website=Bollywood Hungama|title=Meet Kartik Aaryan as Veer and Raghu in Imtiaz Ali\u2019s Love Aaj Kal|date=21 January 2020|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Sara Ali Khan]] as Zoe Chauhan\n* [[Randeep Hooda]] as Raj Mehta, in reality an adult Raghuvendra \"Raghu\" Singh<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/bollywood-news/article/five-years-after-highway-randeep-hooda-to-reunite-with-imtiaz-ali-for-his-next/369041|website= Times Now News 18|title=Five years after Highway, Randeep Hooda to reunite with Imtiaz Ali for his next?|date=20 February 2019|access-date=21 March 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Aarushi Sharma]] as Leena Sharma\n* [[Varun Sharma]] as Karan Singh\n\n==Production==\nOn 17 January 2019, it was reported that Ali was considering his next venture with Khan and Aaryan, a romantic film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/cant-reveal-imtiaz-ali-on-working-with-kartik-aryan-and-sara-ali-khan-in-his-next/articleshow/67575015.cms|title=Imtiaz Ali on working with Kartik Aaryan and Sara Ali Khan in his next|date=17 January 2019|access-date=21 March 2019|newspaper=Times of India}}</ref> On 1 March 2019, it was confirmed that the pair has been teamed up in directorial venture of Ali and the filming is starting in [[Delhi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abplive.in/movies/luka-chhupi-star-kartik-aryan-sara-ali-khan-in-imtiaz-alis-love-aaj-kal-2-931342|title=CONFIRMED!

They leave together from the bar and decide to spend the night together at Veer's home but Veer stops Zoe from continuing their act. He tells her that the time is not right. Zoe leaves, infuriated. Veer keeps following Zoe, who finally confronts him and asks him not to follow her. \n\nThere is a flashback scene where Leena and Raghuvendra \"Raghu\" Singh have the same conversation back in the 1990s in Udaipur.\n\nBack to present day, Veer drops her for an interview at the office of the Mehta Group and they slowly begin their relationship. The group's owner, Raj Mehta, also owns the place where Zoe hangs out very often. Raj, who is good friends with Zoe, tells her the story of his childhood sweetheart, Leena, thus implying that he is a grown up Raghu. He tells her that he used to behave with Leena just as Veer behaves with Zoe, and recites his own childhood memories with Leena to Zoe and tells her how he asked Leena for a dance together.\n\nIn the flashback, it is seen that Raghu and Leena used to meet each other secretly and how Raghu left everything for Leena and moved for her to Delhi, discotinuing his studies to be with Leena. Zoe walks in on Raj and his wife, assuming she is Leena, but realizes it's not the case. Raj reveals that he left Leena.

The regular season began on August 30 and concluded on November 5. It was the program's 44th season fielding a men's varsity soccer team, and their 7th season in the AAC. The 2019 season was [[Scott Calabrese]]'s third year as head coach for the program.\n\nUCF finished the season with a 15\u20133\u20132 overall record and a 6\u20130\u20131 conference record, best in the AAC. The Knights advanced to the finals of the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament|AAC Tournament]] where they fell to [[2019 SMU Mustangs men's soccer team|SMU]] for the third consecutive year. They received an at-large bid to the the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and advanced to the third round where they were defeated by SMU. \n\n== Background ==\n{{main|2018 UCF Knights men's soccer team}}\nThe Knights are coming off a 13\u20133\u20133 season where they finished 5\u20131\u20131 in AAC play, earning them their first [[American Athletic Conference]] regular season title. In the [[2018 American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament]], UCF lost to [[SMU Mustangs men's soccer|SMU]] in [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty kicks]], 4\u20135 after a 1\u20131 draw in regulation and extra time. UCF earned an at-large berth into the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament]], where they were one of the 16 seeded teams (out of 48 teams total) given the 14 seed. It was UCF's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2011. With the seed, they earned a bye into the second round where they hosted the winner of Washington and Lipscomb. Lipscomb beat Washington in penalties, and also ended up beating the Knights in overtime, thus ending the season for UCF.\n\nJunior striker, Cal Jennings, lead UCF in goals and assists for 2018 and was named a [[2018 NCAA Men's Soccer All-Americans|consensus All-American]] with [[TopDrawerSoccer.com|Top Drawer Soccer]], ''[[Soccer America]]'', [[United Soccer Coaches]], and CollegeSoccerNews.com all naming him as a first-team All-American.\n\n== Player movement ==\n=== Departures ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; \"\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Name\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Nat.\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Number\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Position\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Height\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Weight\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Year\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Hometown\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Reason for departure\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Andreas|Steineger|nolink=1}} || {{flag|NOR}} || 2 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=4}} || 190 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Oslo|Oslo, NOR]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Zachary|Waitman|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 5 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 165 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Montverde, Florida|Montverde, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Jonathan|Dean|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 6 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 155 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Macon, Georgia|Macon, GA]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Gorka|Aperribay|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 9 || {{sort|4|[[Forward (association football)|FW]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=1}} || 185 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Springs, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Walker|Dawkins|nolink=1}}|| {{flag|USA}}  || 11 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=7}} || 135 || {{sort|4|RS-Senior}} || [[Royal Palm Beach, Florida|Royal Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9|Dulysse|nolink=1}} || {{flag|HAI}} || 16 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=0}} || 173 || {{sort|2|Sophomore}} || [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Transferred to [[Manhattan Jaspers soccer|Manhattan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gojaspers.com/news/2019/7/31/mens-soccer-manhattan-adds-two-for-2019.aspx|title=Manhattan Adds Two For 2019|website=Manhattan College Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|C.

The regular season began on August 30 and concluded on November 5. It was the program's 44th season fielding a men's varsity soccer team, and their 7th season in the AAC. The 2019 season was [[Scott Calabrese]]'s third year as head coach for the program.\n\nUCF finished the season with a 15\u20133\u20132 overall record and a 6\u20130\u20131 conference record, best in the AAC. The Knights advanced to the finals of the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament|AAC Tournament]] where they fell to [[2019 SMU Mustangs men's soccer team|SMU]] for the third consecutive year. They received an at-large bid to the the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and advanced to the third round where they were defeated by SMU. \n\n== Background ==\n{{main|2018 UCF Knights men's soccer team}}\nThe Knights are coming off a 13\u20133\u20133 season where they finished 5\u20131\u20131 in AAC play, earning them their first [[American Athletic Conference]] regular season title. In the [[2018 American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament]], UCF lost to [[SMU Mustangs men's soccer|SMU]] in [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty kicks]], 4\u20135 after a 1\u20131 draw in regulation and extra time. UCF earned an at-large berth into the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament]], where they were one of the 16 seeded teams (out of 48 teams total) given the 14 seed. It was UCF's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2011. With the seed, they earned a bye into the second round where they hosted the winner of Washington and Lipscomb. Lipscomb beat Washington in penalties, and also ended up beating the Knights in overtime, thus ending the season for UCF.\n\nJunior striker, Cal Jennings, lead UCF in goals and assists for 2018 and was named a [[2018 NCAA Men's Soccer All-Americans|consensus All-American]] with [[TopDrawerSoccer.com|Top Drawer Soccer]], ''[[Soccer America]]'', [[United Soccer Coaches]], and CollegeSoccerNews.com all naming him as a first-team All-American.\n\n== Player movement ==\n=== Departures ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; \"\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Name\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Nat.\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Number\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Position\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Height\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Weight\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Year\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Hometown\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Reason for departure\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Andreas|Steineger|nolink=1}} || {{flag|NOR}} || 2 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=4}} || 190 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Oslo|Oslo, NOR]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Zachary|Waitman|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 5 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 165 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Montverde, Florida|Montverde, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Jonathan|Dean|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 6 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 155 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Macon, Georgia|Macon, GA]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Gorka|Aperribay|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 9 || {{sort|4|[[Forward (association football)|FW]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=1}} || 185 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Springs, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Walker|Dawkins|nolink=1}}|| {{flag|USA}}  || 11 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=7}} || 135 || {{sort|4|RS-Senior}} || [[Royal Palm Beach, Florida|Royal Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9|Dulysse|nolink=1}} || {{flag|HAI}} || 16 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=0}} || 173 || {{sort|2|Sophomore}} || [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Transferred to [[Manhattan Jaspers soccer|Manhattan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gojaspers.com/news/2019/7/31/mens-soccer-manhattan-adds-two-for-2019.aspx|title=Manhattan Adds Two For 2019|website=Manhattan College Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|C.
