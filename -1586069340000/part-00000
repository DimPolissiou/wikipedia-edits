Competitors may use any [[programming language]] and [[Development environment (software development process)|development environment]] to obtain their solutions. From 2003 to 2007, Google Code Jam was deployed on [[Topcoder]]'s platform. Since 2008 Google has developed their own dedicated infrastructure for the contest.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2018{{r|\"2019 FAQ\"}}, Google also ran Distributed Code Jam, with the focus on [[distributed algorithm]]s.{{r|\"Ghoshal 2015\"}} This was run in parallel with the regular Code Jam, with its own qualification and final round, for a top prize of $10,000, but was only open for people who qualified to Round 2 of Code Jam (up to 3000 people).\n\nSeveral Google Code Jam problems have led to academic research.{{r|\"acm2696032\"}}\n\n== Past winners ==\n=== Google Code Jam ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

Gregersen Christensen 2011 p. 196\"}} The competition began in 2003.{{r|\"Lowe 2009 p. 284\"}} The competition consists of a set of [[algorithm]]ic problems which must be solved in a fixed amount of time. Competitors may use any [[programming language]] and [[Development environment (software development process)|development environment]] to obtain their solutions. From 2003 to 2007, Google Code Jam was deployed on [[Topcoder]]'s platform. Since 2008 Google has developed their own dedicated infrastructure for the contest.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2018{{r|\"2019 FAQ\"}}, Google also ran Distributed Code Jam, with the focus on [[distributed algorithm]]s.{{r|\"Ghoshal 2015\"}} This was run in parallel with the regular Code Jam, with its own qualification and final round, for a top prize of $10,000, but was only open for people who qualified to Round 2 of Code Jam (up to 3000 people).\n\nSeveral Google Code Jam problems have led to academic research.{{r|\"acm2696032\"}}\n\n== Past winners ==\n=== Google Code Jam ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

Roulin finds the death suspicious, as merely weeks earlier Van Gogh claimed through letters that his mood was calm and normal. Armand reluctantly agrees and heads for Paris.\n\n[[P\u00e8re Tanguy]], a [[Montmartre]] art supplier, tells Armand that Theo actually died six months after Vincent. He suggests that Armand travel to [[Auvers-sur-Oise]] and look for [[Paul Gachet|Dr. Paul Gachet]], who housed Van Gogh after his release from an asylum, shared his love for art, and attended the funeral. Once there, Armand learns that the doctor is out on business. So he stays at [[Auberge Ravoux|the same inn]] that Van Gogh did during his time in the area. There he meets the temporary proprietress [[Portraits by Vincent van Gogh#Adeline Ravoux|Adeline Ravoux]], who was fond of Van Gogh and who was also surprised by his death. At her suggestion, Armand visits the local boatman, who informs him that Van Gogh kept close company with Dr. Gachet's sheltered daughter, Marguerite. When Armand visits her, Marguerite denies and is angered when Armand implies that Van Gogh's suicidal mood could have resulted from an argument with her father.\n\nThroughout the investigation, Armand begins to suspect a local boy named Ren\u00e9 Secretan, who reportedly liked to torment Van Gogh, was in possession of a gun, and had often drunkenly waved it around town. Dr. Mazery, who examined Van Gogh, also claims that the shot must have come from a few feet away, ruling out suicide. When Armand implicates Ren\u00e9, Marguerite confesses that she was in close, but not romantic, relations with Van Gogh, but she does not believe that Ren\u00e9 was capable of murder.\n\nDr. Gachet finally returns and promises to deliver Armand's letter to Theo's widow. He admits there was an argument between them \u2013 Van Gogh accused Gachet of being a coward for not pursuing his dreams, to which Gachet angrily accused Van Gogh of deteriorating Theo's health by overly depending on his brother. Gachet posits that this accusation drove Van Gogh to suicide in order to release Theo from the burden. After Armand returns home, postman Roulin later receives word from Theo's widow, [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Johanna]], thanking Armand for returning the letter. Johanna attaches to her letter to Armand one of Van Gogh's letters to her \u2013 signed, \"Your loving Vincent.\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Avp La Passion Van Gogh.jpg|thumb|Directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman at the film's French premiere in Paris, with actor [[Pierre Niney]] who provided the voice of Armand Roulin in the French version.]]\nThe leading cast is as follows:<ref>Waring, Olivia (2016) [http://metro.co.uk/2016/03/23/this-animated-van-gogh-movie-rendered-entirely-in-paint-looks-unbelievably-stunning-5771097/ This animated Van Gogh movie rendered entirely in paint looks unbelievably stunning]; ''Metro 87.1M'', 23 March 2016.

Roulin finds the death suspicious, as merely weeks earlier Van Gogh claimed through letters that his mood was calm and normal. Armand reluctantly agrees and heads for Paris.\n\n[[P\u00e8re Tanguy]], a [[Montmartre]] art supplier, tells Armand that Theo actually died six months after Vincent. He suggests that Armand travel to [[Auvers-sur-Oise]] and look for [[Paul Gachet|Dr. Paul Gachet]], who housed Van Gogh after his release from an asylum, shared his love for art, and attended the funeral. Once there, Armand learns that the doctor is out on business. So he stays at [[Auberge Ravoux|the same inn]] that Van Gogh did during his time in the area. There he meets the temporary proprietress [[Portraits by Vincent van Gogh#Adeline Ravoux|Adeline Ravoux]], who was fond of Van Gogh and who was also surprised by his death. At her suggestion, Armand visits the local boatman, who informs him that Van Gogh kept close company with Dr. Gachet's sheltered daughter, Marguerite. When Armand visits her, Marguerite denies and is angered when Armand implies that Van Gogh's suicidal mood could have resulted from an argument with her father.\n\nThroughout the investigation, Armand begins to suspect a local boy named Ren\u00e9 Secretan, who reportedly liked to torment Van Gogh, was in possession of a gun, and had often drunkenly waved it around town. Dr. Mazery, who examined Van Gogh, also claims that the shot must have come from a few feet away, ruling out suicide. When Armand implicates Ren\u00e9, Marguerite confesses that she was in close, but not romantic, relations with Van Gogh, but she does not believe that Ren\u00e9 was capable of murder.\n\nDr. Gachet finally returns and promises to deliver Armand's letter to Theo's widow. He admits there was an argument between them \u2013 Van Gogh accused Gachet of being a coward for not pursuing his dreams, to which Gachet angrily accused Van Gogh of deteriorating Theo's health by overly depending on his brother. Gachet posits that this accusation drove Van Gogh to suicide in order to release Theo from the burden. After Armand returns home, postman Roulin later receives word from Theo's widow, [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Johanna]], thanking Armand for returning the letter. Johanna attaches to her letter to Armand one of Van Gogh's letters to her \u2013 signed, \"Your loving Vincent.\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Avp La Passion Van Gogh.jpg|thumb|Directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman at the film's French premiere in Paris, with actor [[Pierre Niney]] who provided the voice of Armand Roulin in the French version.]]\nThe leading cast is as follows:<ref>Waring, Olivia (2016) [http://metro.co.uk/2016/03/23/this-animated-van-gogh-movie-rendered-entirely-in-paint-looks-unbelievably-stunning-5771097/ This animated Van Gogh movie rendered entirely in paint looks unbelievably stunning]; ''Metro 87.1M'', 23 March 2016.

Production for the film began with a live-action cast filming against a [[green screen]]. After filming, editors composited Van Gogh paintings into scene backgrounds, and finally cut the movie together as usual. However, once the actual film was complete, they shot each individual frame onto a blank canvas, and artists painted over each image.
