When [[amusement arcade]]s grew in popularity within the UK, Hart became a frequent visitor to the different arcades located around his local area, where he started to play ''Street Fighter'' and ''[[Street Fighter II: The World Warrior]]'', among other games. During his [[secondary school]] years, Hart's family relocated to [[Croydon]] in [[South London]], where he frequently visited arcades and began to gain local reputation among classmates and arcade visitors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ryanjosephhart.com/wiki.html|title=Wiki|website=www.ryanjosephhart.com|access-date=2018-09-25}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nHart has worked in many different areas of the [[Esports]] industry, these include (but not limited to) [[Esports|professional player]], [[Tournament|tournament organiser]], [[Team management|team manage]]<nowiki/>r, [[Sports commentator|caster]], [[interview]]er, [[consultant]], coach and [[content creation]].\n\nOutside of Esports, Hart has also worked for many years in the video game industry, for companies such as [[Sammy Corporation|Sammy Europe]], [[Sega|Sega Europe]] and [[Nintendo|Nintendo of Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanjosephhart/|title=Ryan Hart Linkedin|last=Hart|first=Ryan|date=10 January 2019|website=LinkedIn|access-date=10 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Professional player ===\n==== Early career ====\nHart's first tournament was for the game ''[[Street Fighter II Turbo: Hyper Fighting|Street Fighter II Turbo]]'', held in [[London Trocadero]] in 1994, the event was sponsored by [[Kiss (UK radio station)|Kiss FM]].

It was with ''Tekken 2'' that Hart had his first success, entering the Tekken 2 UK National Tournament, where he placed 4th with the character [[King (Tekken)|King]].\n\nWith the release of ''[[The King of Fighters '96]]'', Hart entered the National King of Fighters 96' Championship in December 1996.

Hart began to explore other fighting games, having huge success with [[Sega|Sega's]] ''[[Virtua Fighter 3]]'', winning nine championships in a row at the Namco Wonderpark located in [[Central London]].

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does. However, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing.

Despite this success, Henderson was reprimanded for secretly using hospital facilities to build the machine.<ref name=\"Wills\">{{cite book| last=Wills| first=Elspeth| title=Scottish Firsts: A Celebration of Innovation and Achievement| publisher=[[Mainstream Publishing]]| location=Edinburgh| year=2002| pages=[https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51 51\u20132]| isbn=978-1840186116| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite web| last=Thomas| first=Campbell| date=15 February 2000| url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/dr-robert-henderson-1.249085| title=Dr Robert Henderson | work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]| accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Both respirator==\n[[File:Both Cabinet Respirator in WWII.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Both cabinet respirator being used to treat a patient at the 110th Australian Military Hospital in 1943]]\n{{main|Both respirator}}\nThe [[Both respirator]], a negative pressure ventilator, was invented in 1937 when Australia's epidemic of poliomyelitis created an immediate need for more ventilating machines to compensate for respiratory paralysis. Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does. However, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing.

Limited in the west by the Dniester river (separating it from [[Bessarabia]]), in the east by the Southern Bug river (separating it from the German [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]), and in the south by the [[Black Sea]], it comprised the present-day region of [[Transnistria]] (which compared to the World War II whole is only a small strip along the bank of the Dniester) and territories further east (modern [[Odessa Oblast]] eastward of the Dniester and southern [[Vinnytsia Oblast]]), including the Black Sea port of [[Odessa]], which became the administrative capital of Transnistria during World War II.\n\nIn World War II, the [[Kingdom of Romania]], persuaded and aided by [[Nazi Germany]], took control of Transnistria for the first time in history. In August 1941, [[Adolf Hitler]] persuaded [[Ion Antonescu]] to take control of the territory as a substitute for [[Northern Transylvania]], occupied by [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]'s [[Hungary during World War II|Hungary]] following the [[Second Vienna Award]]. Despite the Romanian administration, the Kingdom of Romania did not formally incorporate Transnistria into its administrative framework; the Nazi-friendly Antonescu government hoped to annex the territory eventually, but developments on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] precluded it.<ref name=\"Tra\u015fc\u01032008\">{{in lang|ro}} Ottmar Tra\u015fc\u0103, ''[http://www.history-cluj.ro/Istorie/anuare/AnuarBaritHistorica2008/20%20OttmarTrasca.pdf Ocuparea ora\u0219ului Odessa...]'', \"George Bari\u0163iu\" Institute of History's Annual, ''Series HISTORICA'', 2008.</ref>\n\n==Romanian conquest of Transnistria==\n[[File:Colita fratia de arme cu supratipar Odesa.jpg|thumb|300px|1941 Romanian stamp commemorating the [[Siege of Odessa|Fall of Odessa]] and the \"[[Crusade against Bolshevism]]\".]]\n\nUntil 26 July 1941, the Romanian Army had pushed the Soviet Army out of [[Bessarabia]], the territory of Romania occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940. [[Nazi Germany]] wanted Romania as an ally in the war against the Soviet Union. However, Romania was complacent about recovering its own territory. To facilitate the persuasion of the then-dictator of Romania, Ion Antonescu, Hitler ordered the German Army to advance into Ukraine from north to south, following a route east of the [[Southern Bug]] river, in order to trap Soviet troops between [[Dniester]] and the Southern Bug. Antonescu was thus faced with a simple task for his army: conquer from the encircled and retreating Red Army troops a precisely delimited area. Antonescu ordered the [[Romanian Fourth Army]] to undertake this task.\n\nDuring the first week of the advance, in mid-August 1941, Romanian forces took over all of the region, except for a small area around [[Odessa]], without a fight. At the time, the Romanians had 60,000 soldiers to conquer the city from its 34,000 defenders. However, the organization was so poor, and the command was so superficial, that the [[Siege of Odessa (1941)|attack resulted in a military blunder]]. Exploiting this success, the Soviets stopped the evacuation of the city by sea and instead sent reinforcements, bolstering the strength of the Soviet forces up to 100,000.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The Romanians were forced to more than double their own numbers as well. Although occasionally, on some small portions of the front lines, low- and medium-rank Romanian officers showed clear successes, the general organization of the siege was disastrous for the Romanians, and several generals were dismissed afterwards. Eventually, after two months of siege, the Romanian army took control of the city at the price of 92,545 casualties. Only in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] were Romanian casualty figures higher, but then the Romanians would face a numerically and technically superior enemy. Although the Soviets eventually left the city, they were able to block a larger enemy force with a smaller one, and inflict significant casualties on the attackers. This result was especially important, because the Soviet High Command had initially ordered the city abandoned. At the end of the war, Odessa received the title of ''[[Hero city]]''.\n\nOnce Romanian troops entered Odessa, they established the headquarters of two of their divisions in the local [[NKVD]] building. However, the building was mined by the Soviets, who blew it up, killing over 100 members of the Romanian divisional headquarters, including almost 50 officers, paralyzing the activity of the two divisions for two weeks. In reprisal, Ion Antonescu ordered the arrest and massacre of civilians suspected of aiding the Red Army. When it became clear that identifying individuals directly responsible for the incident would be almost impossible, Antonescu ordered the shooting of Jews. The [[1941 Odessa massacre|massacre that followed]] resulted in 19,000 civilians killed, the  majority of whom had nothing to do with the military action. A further number of Odessa Jews were deported to ghettos and concentration camps in the northern half of the region.\n\nA partisan movement, with a strength of 300, was active in the [[Odessa catacombs]] all throughout the occupation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} It managed to organize an excellent communication with the partisan headquarters in Moscow. Antonescu was advised to use poisonous gas to clear the catacombs, but, afraid of the public implications of such an act, decided to abstain from it. Eventually, Romanians were able to inflict a high number of casualties on the partisans with the help of some partisans who switched sides and revealed the movement through the catacombs. Yet, the catacombs were never completely cleared, and the partisans maintained a continuous resistance movement until the return of the Red Army.\n\n==Status with respect to Romania proper==\n[[File:Duca Voda.JPG|thumb|300px|Romanian stamps from late 1941 issued for Transnistria]]\nAlbeit not annexing the region outright, the Romanian Antonescu government organized the territory in the ''Guvern\u0103m\u00e2ntul Transnistriei'' under Romanian governor, [[Gheorghe Alexianu]].<ref name=\"Tra\u015fc\u01032008\"/>\n\nThe Nazi-allied Antonescu government hoped to annex the territory eventually, but developments on the Eastern Front precluded it.<ref name=\"Tra\u015fc\u01032008\"/>\n\nRomanian opposition parties were against Romanian operations beyond Bessarabia and Bukovina.<ref name=\"Tra\u015fc\u01032008\"/> Two preeminent political figures of the day, [[Iuliu Maniu]] and [[Dinu Br\u0103tianu|Constantin Br\u0103tianu]] declared that \"the Romanian people will never consent to the continuation of the struggle beyond our national borders.\"<ref>[[Charles King (professor of international affairs)|Charles King]], ''The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture'', Hoover Institution Press, Stanford, CA, 2000.  {{ISBN|0-8179-9792-X}}</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[File:ROMANIA MAI 1942.png|thumb|300px|The counties and lower level administrative divisions of Romania, Transnistria included.]]\n\nThe territory was divided into 13 counties (sing.

Theaters were opened in Odessa and Tiraspol, as well as several museums, libraries, and cinemas throughout the region. On 7 December 1941, the University of Odessa was reopened with 6 faculties - medicine, polytechnical, law, sciences, languages and agricultural engineering.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} Anatol Petrenci, \"Basarabia \u00een timpul celui de-al doilea r\u0103zboi mondial (1939-1945)\", Ed.

Antonescu replied three days later, stating that he could only assume responsibility for the area between the Dniester and the Bug, due to lacking \"the means and trained staff\". The Romanian leader was however willing to supply security troops for the area between the Bug and the Dnieper. The German-Romanian agreement for the creation of Transnistria was signed on 19 August, at [[Tiraspol]]. It was consolidated by a convention signed at Tighina on 30 August, which however did not clearly define the northern borders of Transnistria. Antonescu claimed the Northern towns of [[Mohyliv-Podilskyi]], [[Zhmerynka]] and [[Tulchyn]], a request to which Hitler acceded. The final borders were recognized on 4 September, in a German order establishing a boundary between Transnistria and the rear of Army Group South.<ref>David Stahel, Cambridge University Press, 2017, ''Joining Hitler's Crusade'', p. 71</ref> The resulting territory amounted to {{convert|42000|km2}}. It was divided into 13 counties, each ruled by a high-ranking officer with the role of prefect. A county was further divided into raions, each raion being ruled by a praetor, who had much broader powers than the prefect. The entire region, forming a single Governorate, was led by one Governor, Gheorghe Alexianu.<ref>[[Geoffrey P. Megargee]], Joseph R.

In addition, most of the products sent to Germany were provided without monetary compensation. As a result of  these \"uncompensated exports\", [[inflation]] in Romania skyrocketed, causing widespread discontent among the Romanian population, even among groups and individuals who had once enthusiastically supported the Germans and the war.\n\nTransnistria was relatively spared by these air bombings, but soon the Red Army destroyed all the Romanian presence in the region. During the [[Uman\u2013Boto\u015fani Offensive]] the Soviet troops crossed the higher Bug river on March 11 and in twenty days more the Transnistria Governorate \"disappeared\". By the end of March 1944 there were no more Axis troops east of the Dniester river, save for the encircled capital [[Odessa]]. Meanwhile, the replacement of Governor Alexianu happened on February 1, 1944, by the military governor, Lt General Potopeanu (formerly Romanian Economy Minister). The name Transnistria dropped out of use, and the authorities were increasingly referred to as ''Military Government between Dniester and Bug''.\n\nOn March 28, the Red Army took Nikolaev and the next day crossed the lower Bug river in force. On April 5, Razdelnaia fell, and therewith the Odessa-Tiraspol highway was cut. On the 19th, after a brief but bitter fight, the Red Army re-entered Odessa. On the April 12, [[Tiraspol]] was occupied, and four days later all Transnistria was again in Soviet hands. \nDuring the final days, the Germans concentrated on destruction in Odessa, since evacuation was impossible. Port installations, some industrial facilities, and transportation junctions were blown up (even the electric power plant, various mills, stores of bread, sugar, and other foods were destroyed). Of Odessa's population, scarcely 200,000 remained; many had hidden in the vicinity while some had sought safety in the countryside. And some had left westward with the Romanians and Germans: only those most compromised had left; the bulk of the residents had stayed in the region. People feared Soviet repressions, but \"there was no other way out\", according to German sources.<ref>OKH/GenStdH/FHO (IIIa), \u201cKgf.-Vernehmung,\u201d CRS, H3/690,pp.245-246.</ref> It is worth noting however, that there was still a very small piece of Transnistrian territory still left under Romanian rule as late as August 1944, according to an [[Oberkommando des Heeres|OKH]] map depicting the situation on the Romanian front as of 20 August. This area comprised a Westwards salient created by the Dniester river, centered around [[Co\u0219ni\u021ba]] (today part of the  [[Dub\u0103sari District]] of the [[Republic of Moldova]]).<ref>Karl-Heinz Frieser, Oxford University Press, 2017, ''The Eastern Front, 1943-1944: The War in the East and on the Neighbouring Fronts'', p. 791</ref>\n\n===Reduction of the Transnistria neo-Latin population===\n\nToday east of the Dniester there are only 237,785 [[Moldovans|Romance-speaking residents]] left, a small percentage of the overall population of the region, most of whom live in the actual [[Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic|Transnistria break-away republic]]. But historically they were the majority: according to the results of the Russian census (quoted in Romanian sources) of 1793, 49 villages out of 67 between the Dniester and the [[Southern Bug]] were Romanian.<ref>E. Lozovan, Romanii orientali\u2026(Eastern Romanians\u2026), ,,Neamul Romanesc\u201d, 1/1991, p.32. Vlachs/Romanians east of the Dniester river and up to the Bug river area]</ref>\n\nAnd further east of the Transnistria Governorate there were many neo-Latin communities: indeed the Romanians/Moldavians in Ukraine - east of the Bug river - were calculated by a German census to be nearly 780.000 (probably an excessive number),{{fact|date=September 2017}} and were made plans to move them to Transnistria in 1942/43. But nothing was done.\n\n{{Quote|A far more likely figure was that given by a Romanian daily in March 1943. It reported that, as of the summer of 1942, 23,000 Moldavian families had been located in Soviet territory east of the Bug (under German occupation).

Limited in the west by the Dniester river (separating it from [[Bessarabia]]), in the east by the Southern Bug river (separating it from the German [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]), and in the south by the [[Black Sea]], it comprised the present-day region of [[Transnistria]] (which compared to the World War II whole is only a small strip along the bank of the Dniester) and territories further east (modern [[Odessa Oblast]] eastward of the Dniester and southern [[Vinnytsia Oblast]]), including the Black Sea port of [[Odessa]], which became the administrative capital of Transnistria during World War II.\n\nIn World War II, the [[Kingdom of Romania]], persuaded and aided by [[Nazi Germany]], took control of Transnistria for the first time in history. In August 1941, [[Adolf Hitler]] persuaded [[Ion Antonescu]] to take control of the territory as a substitute for [[Northern Transylvania]], occupied by [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]]'s [[Hungary during World War II|Hungary]] following the [[Second Vienna Award]]. Despite the Romanian administration, the Kingdom of Romania did not formally incorporate Transnistria into its administrative framework; the Nazi-friendly Antonescu government hoped to annex the territory eventually, but developments on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] precluded it.<ref name=\"Tra\u015fc\u01032008\">{{in lang|ro}} Ottmar Tra\u015fc\u0103, ''[http://www.history-cluj.ro/Istorie/anuare/AnuarBaritHistorica2008/20%20OttmarTrasca.pdf Ocuparea ora\u0219ului Odessa...]'', \"George Bari\u0163iu\" Institute of History's Annual, ''Series HISTORICA'', 2008.</ref>\n\n==Romanian conquest of Transnistria==\n[[File:Colita fratia de arme cu supratipar Odesa.jpg|thumb|300px|1941 Romanian stamp commemorating the [[Siege of Odessa|Fall of Odessa]] and the \"[[Crusade against Bolshevism]]\".]]\n\nUntil 26 July 1941, the Romanian Army had pushed the Soviet Army out of [[Bessarabia]], the territory of Romania occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940. [[Nazi Germany]] wanted Romania as an ally in the war against the Soviet Union. However, Romania was complacent about recovering its own territory. To facilitate the persuasion of the then-dictator of Romania, Ion Antonescu, Hitler ordered the German Army to advance into Ukraine from north to south, following a route east of the [[Southern Bug]] river, in order to trap Soviet troops between [[Dniester]] and the Southern Bug. Antonescu was thus faced with a simple task for his army: conquer from the encircled and retreating Red Army troops a precisely delimited area. Antonescu ordered the [[Romanian Fourth Army]] to undertake this task.\n\nDuring the first week of the advance, in mid-August 1941, Romanian forces took over all of the region, except for a small area around [[Odessa]], without a fight. At the time, the Romanians had 60,000 soldiers to conquer the city from its 34,000 defenders. However, the organization was so poor, and the command was so superficial, that the [[Siege of Odessa (1941)|attack resulted in a military blunder]]. Exploiting this success, the Soviets stopped the evacuation of the city by sea and instead sent reinforcements, bolstering the strength of the Soviet forces up to 100,000.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} The Romanians were forced to more than double their own numbers as well. Although occasionally, on some small portions of the front lines, low- and medium-rank Romanian officers showed clear successes, the general organization of the siege was disastrous for the Romanians, and several generals were dismissed afterwards. Eventually, after two months of siege, the Romanian army took control of the city at the price of 92,545 casualties. Only in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] were Romanian casualty figures higher, but then the Romanians would face a numerically and technically superior enemy. Although the Soviets eventually left the city, they were able to block a larger enemy force with a smaller one, and inflict significant casualties on the attackers. This result was especially important, because the Soviet High Command had initially ordered the city abandoned. At the end of the war, Odessa received the title of ''[[Hero city]]''.\n\nOnce Romanian troops entered Odessa, they established the headquarters of two of their divisions in the local [[NKVD]] building. However, the building was mined by the Soviets, who blew it up, killing over 100 members of the Romanian divisional headquarters, including almost 50 officers, paralyzing the activity of the two divisions for two weeks. In reprisal, Ion Antonescu ordered the arrest and massacre of civilians suspected of aiding the Red Army. When it became clear that identifying individuals directly responsible for the incident would be almost impossible, Antonescu ordered the shooting of Jews. The [[1941 Odessa massacre|massacre that followed]] resulted in 19,000 civilians killed, the  majority of whom had nothing to do with the military action. A further number of Odessa Jews were deported to ghettos and concentration camps in the northern half of the region.\n\nA partisan movement, with a strength of 300, was active in the [[Odessa catacombs]] all throughout the occupation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} It managed to organize an excellent communication with the partisan headquarters in Moscow. Antonescu was advised to use poisonous gas to clear the catacombs, but, afraid of the public implications of such an act, decided to abstain from it. Eventually, Romanians were able to inflict a high number of casualties on the partisans with the help of some partisans who switched sides and revealed the movement through the catacombs.

Antonescu replied three days later, stating that he could only assume responsibility for the area between the Dniester and the Bug, due to lacking \"the means and trained staff\". The Romanian leader was however willing to supply security troops for the area between the Bug and the Dnieper. The German-Romanian agreement for the creation of Transnistria was signed on 19 August, at [[Tiraspol]]. It was consolidated by a convention signed at Tighina on 30 August, which however did not clearly define the northern borders of Transnistria. Antonescu claimed the Northern towns of [[Mohyliv-Podilskyi]], [[Zhmerynka]] and [[Tulchyn]], a request to which Hitler acceded. The final borders were recognized on 4 September, in a German order establishing a boundary between Transnistria and the rear of Army Group South.<ref>David Stahel, Cambridge University Press, 2017, ''Joining Hitler's Crusade'', p. 71</ref> The resulting territory amounted to {{convert|42000|km2}}.

In addition, most of the products sent to Germany were provided without monetary compensation. As a result of  these \"uncompensated exports\", [[inflation]] in Romania skyrocketed, causing widespread discontent among the Romanian population, even among groups and individuals who had once enthusiastically supported the Germans and the war.\n\nTransnistria was relatively spared by these air bombings, but soon the Red Army destroyed all the Romanian presence in the region. During the [[Uman\u2013Boto\u015fani Offensive]] the Soviet troops crossed the higher Bug river on March 11 and in twenty days more the Transnistria Governorate \"disappeared\". By the end of March 1944 there were no more Axis troops east of the Dniester river, save for the encircled capital [[Odessa]]. Meanwhile, the replacement of Governor Alexianu happened on February 1, 1944, by the military governor, Lt General Potopeanu (formerly Romanian Economy Minister). The name Transnistria dropped out of use, and the authorities were increasingly referred to as ''Military Government between Dniester and Bug''.\n\nOn March 28, the Red Army took Nikolaev and the next day crossed the lower Bug river in force. On April 5, Razdelnaia fell, and therewith the Odessa-Tiraspol highway was cut. On the 19th, after a brief but bitter fight, the Red Army re-entered Odessa. On the April 12, [[Tiraspol]] was occupied, and four days later all Transnistria was again in Soviet hands. \nDuring the final days, the Germans concentrated on destruction in Odessa, since evacuation was impossible. Port installations, some industrial facilities, and transportation junctions were blown up (even the electric power plant, various mills, stores of bread, sugar, and other foods were destroyed). Of Odessa's population, scarcely 200,000 remained; many had hidden in the vicinity while some had sought safety in the countryside. And some had left westward with the Romanians and Germans: only those most compromised had left; the bulk of the residents had stayed in the region. People feared Soviet repressions, but \"there was no other way out\", according to German sources.<ref>OKH/GenStdH/FHO (IIIa), \u201cKgf.-Vernehmung,\u201d CRS, H3/690,pp.245-246.</ref> It is worth noting however, that there was still a very small piece of Transnistrian territory still left under Romanian rule as late as August 1944, according to an [[Oberkommando des Heeres|OKH]] map depicting the situation on the Romanian front as of 20 August. This area comprised a Westwards salient created by the Dniester river, centered around [[Co\u0219ni\u021ba]] (today part of the  [[Dub\u0103sari District]] of the [[Republic of Moldova]]).<ref>Karl-Heinz Frieser, Oxford University Press, 2017, ''The Eastern Front, 1943-1944: The War in the East and on the Neighbouring Fronts'', p. 791</ref>\n\n===Reduction of the Transnistria neo-Latin population===\n\nToday east of the Dniester there are only 237,785 [[Moldovans|Romance-speaking residents]] left, a small percentage of the overall population of the region, most of whom live in the actual [[Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic|Transnistria break-away republic]]. But historically they were the majority: according to the results of the Russian census (quoted in Romanian sources) of 1793, 49 villages out of 67 between the Dniester and the [[Southern Bug]] were Romanian.<ref>E. Lozovan, Romanii orientali\u2026(Eastern Romanians\u2026), ,,Neamul Romanesc\u201d, 1/1991, p.32. Vlachs/Romanians east of the Dniester river and up to the Bug river area]</ref>\n\nAnd further east of the Transnistria Governorate there were many neo-Latin communities: indeed the Romanians/Moldavians in Ukraine - east of the Bug river - were calculated by a German census to be nearly 780.000 (probably an excessive number),{{fact|date=September 2017}} and were made plans to move them to Transnistria in 1942/43. But nothing was done.\n\n{{Quote|A far more likely figure was that given by a Romanian daily in March 1943. It reported that, as of the summer of 1942, 23,000 Moldavian families had been located in Soviet territory east of the Bug (under German occupation). A group of these had been made to make records of their folk music \"in order to preserve proof of the permanence of the Romanian element in the distant East\" (Universul, March 15, 1943).<ref>Dallin, Alexander. ''Odessa, 1941-1944: A Case Study of Soviet Territory Under Foreign Rule.''Chapter 2.
