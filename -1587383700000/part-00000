In more recent times, it was owned by the [[Guinness family]].\n\n==Ross Hill Abbey==\nIn the Ross Hill cemetery of stands the ruins of Teampall Brendain. The ruin is sited within an ancient oval enclosure known as a Caiseal or Cashel.

Forward time travel, outside the usual sense of [[time perception|the perception of time]], is an extensively observed phenomenon and well-understood within the framework of [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. However, making one body advance or delay more than a few milliseconds compared to another body is not feasible with current technology. As for backward time travel, it is possible to find [[Exact solutions in general relativity|solutions in general relativity]] that allow for it, such as a rotating [[black hole]].

Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance. For both these methods, [[time dilation]] causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become \"younger\", than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time connects differently ''through'' the wormhole than ''outside'' it, so that [[Synchronization|synchronized]] clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around.<ref name=\"Thorne1994\" />{{rp|502}} This means that an observer entering the \"younger\" end would exit the \"older\" end at a time when it was the same age as the \"younger\" end, effectively going back in time as seen by an observer from the outside.

A similar device might be built from a [[cosmic string]], but none are known to exist, and it does not seem to be possible to create a new cosmic string.

The second law of thermodynamics is understood by modern physicists to be a [[Statistical mechanics|statistical]] law, so [[fluctuation theorem|decreasing entropy or non-increasing entropy]] are not impossible, just improbable. Additionally, entropy statistically increases in systems which are isolated, so non-isolated systems, such as an object, that interact with the outside world, can become less worn and decrease in entropy, and it's possible for an object whose world-line forms a closed loop to be always in the same condition in the same point of its history.<ref name=\"Gott\" />{{rp|23}}\n\nDaniel Greenberger and [[Karl Svozil]] proposed that [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] gives a model for time travel where the past must be self-consistent.<ref name=\"greenberger\">{{cite book|doi=10.1007/3-540-26669-0_4|title=Quo Vadis Quantum Mechanics?|year=2005|arxiv=quant-ph/0506027|bibcode=2005qvqm.book...63G|chapter=Quantum Theory Looks at Time Travel|series=The Frontiers Collection|last1=Greenberger|first1=Daniel M.|last2=Svozil|first2=Karl|isbn=978-3-540-22188-3|page=63}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kettlewell|first=Julianna|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4097258.stm|title=New model 'permits time travel'|work=BBC News|date=June 17, 2005|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== In fiction ==\n{{Further|Time travel in fiction}}\n\nTime travel themes in [[science fiction]] and the media can generally be grouped into three categories: immutable timeline; mutable timeline; and alternate histories, as in the interacting-[[many-worlds interpretation]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Grey|first=William|title=Troubles with Time Travel|journal=Philosophy|volume=74|issue=1|pages=55\u201370|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|doi=10.1017/S0031819199001047}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Rickman|first=Gregg|title=The Science Fiction Film Reader|publisher=Limelight Editions|year=2004|isbn=978-0-87910-994-3|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780879109943}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Schneider|first=Susan|title=Science Fiction and Philosophy: From Time Travel to Superintelligence|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4051-4907-5}}</ref> Frequently in fiction, ''timeline'' is used to refer to all physical events in history, so that in time travel stories where events can be changed, the time traveler is described as creating a new or altered timeline.<ref name=\"Prucher\">Prucher, Jeff (2007) ''Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=iYzi8m8FbEsC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA230 p. 230].</ref> This usage is distinct from the use of the term [[timeline]] to refer to a type of chart that illustrates a particular series of events, and the concept is also distinct from a [[world line]], a term from Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] which refers to the entire history of a ''single'' object.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col |colwidth=27em}}\n'''Claims of time travel'''\n:*[[Time travel claims and urban legends]]\n'''Culture'''\n:*[[Time capsule]]\n'''Fiction'''\n:*[[Time travel in fiction]]\n:*[[List of time travel works of fiction]]\n:*[[List of games containing time travel]]\n:'''Science'''\n:*[[Krasnikov tube]]\n:*[[Retrocausality]]\n:*[[Ring singularity]]\n:*[[Temporal paradox]]\n:*[[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]]\n'''Time perception'''\n:*[[Cryonics]]\n:*[[Suspended animation]]\n:*[[Time perception]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Time travel}}\n{{Wiktionary|time travel}}\n===Overviews and encyclopedic coverage===\n*[http://www.vega.org.uk/video/programme/61 Black holes, Wormholes and Time Travel], a Royal Society Lecture\n*{{HowStuffWorks|time-travel|How Time Travel Will Work}}\n*[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-travel-phys/ Time Travel and Modern Physics] at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n*[http://www.iep.utm.edu/t/timetrav.htm Time Travel] at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n===Articles===\n* [https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/time-travel-ron-mallett-scn/index.html Meet the scientist trying to travel back in time], Francesca Street, CNN \u2022 31st December 2019, CNN. \n* [https://futurism.com/paradox-free-time-travel-parallel-universes Paradox-Free Time Travel Possible With Many Parallel Universes].

Forward time travel, outside the usual sense of [[time perception|the perception of time]], is an extensively observed phenomenon and well-understood within the framework of [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. However, making one body advance or delay more than a few milliseconds compared to another body is not feasible with current technology. As for backward time travel, it is possible to find [[Exact solutions in general relativity|solutions in general relativity]] that allow for it, such as a rotating [[black hole]].

Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance. For both these methods, [[time dilation]] causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become \"younger\", than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time connects differently ''through'' the wormhole than ''outside'' it, so that [[Synchronization|synchronized]] clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around.<ref name=\"Thorne1994\" />{{rp|502}} This means that an observer entering the \"younger\" end would exit the \"older\" end at a time when it was the same age as the \"younger\" end, effectively going back in time as seen by an observer from the outside.

This is possible due to the [[relativity of simultaneity]]. However, the symmetry is broken if one clock accelerates, allowing for less proper time to pass for one clock than the other. The [[twin paradox]] describes this: one twin remains on Earth, while the other undergoes acceleration to [[relativistic speed]] as they travel into space, turn around, and travel back to Earth; the traveling twin ages less than the twin who stayed on Earth, because of the time dilation experienced during their acceleration. General relativity treats the effects of acceleration and the effects of gravity as [[Equivalence principle|equivalent]], and shows that time dilation also occurs in [[gravity well]]s, with a clock deeper in the well ticking more slowly; this effect is taken into account when calibrating the clocks on the satellites of the [[Global Positioning System]], and it could lead to significant differences in rates of aging for observers at different distances from a large gravity well such as a [[black hole]].<ref name=\"Gott\"/>{{rp|33\u2013130}}\n\nA time machine that utilizes this principle might be, for instance, a spherical shell with a diameter of five meters and the [[Jupiter mass|mass of Jupiter]].
