In 1860, [[James N. Kerns]] formed a club, simply named \"Athletic Base Ball Club\", that soon dominated amateur play in the area (Jordan 1999). ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' chronicled a match between Athletic and [[Brooklyn Atlantics|Atlantic of Brooklyn]] for the baseball championship in 1866. A famous Harper's illustration shows the Athletic players in uniforms with the familiar blackletter \"A\" on front.\n\nWhen newspapers developed stand-alone game scores and league standings, the club was termed ''Athletic'' (''Base Ball Club'' being dropped in any case). In prose the team was commonly called ''the Athletics'', plural, and later generations have usually called both club and team the \"Philadelphia Athletics\".\n\n=== National Association ===\nThe Athletics turned professional in the late 1860s and helped establish the first league, [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]] (NA), which began play in 1871. Their home field had been at 15th and Columbia, an otherwise unnamed venue informally called \"the Athletic grounds\". For 1871 they relocated to [[Jefferson Street Grounds]], playing most of their home games there until being expelled from the major leagues after the 1876 season.\n\nThe Athletics were one of the most successful National Association teams, winning the first pennant with a record of 21 wins and 7 losses (.750), two games ahead of the Boston Red Stockings and Chicago White Stockings. Actually, the race was much closer: the primary official criterion then was neither games nor winning percentage, but wins, and the three clubs finished in the order given with 21, 20, and 19 victories. The final game of the season, played on October 30 in Brooklyn, saw Athletic defeat Chicago, 4\u20131, clinching the title.[https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1871/B10300CH11871.htm] Chicago had become a road team following the [[Great Chicago Fire]]. ([[Nate Berkenstock]], a 40-year-old amateur who played right field for Philadelphia that day due to injuries, made his only big-league appearance in that game.)\n\nWhile Boston dominated the NA, winning the other four pennants, the Athletics and [[New York Mutuals]] also fielded teams every year, with Philadelphia winning a few more games overall but never challenging Boston.<ref>Except for the Mutuals in 1874, shorter-lived clubs finished second. Judged by winning percentage, a later criterion, Athletic in 1875 achieved the sixth best season in NA history behind only the five pennant winners. But the criterion was wins, an incentive for clubs to complete their series. In the five NA seasons Athletic ranked 6\u20134\u20136\u20136\u20133 in games played, 1\u20134\u20135\u20133\u20133 in wins. --And the club ranked terminally 7 in games played for 1876.</ref>\n\n[[Dick McBride]] served as regular pitcher for more than a decade and as [[Captain (Major League Baseball)|captain]] throughout the NA seasons, which gives him [[manager (baseball)|manager]] credit today.

Four Red Stockings players ([[catcher]] [[Deacon White]], [[infielder]]s [[Cal McVey]] and [[Ross Barnes]], and [[pitcher]] [[Albert Spalding|Al Spalding]]) and Philadelphia Athletics [[third baseman]] [[Cap Anson]] would play for Chicago in 1876, with [[Ezra Sutton]] remaining in Philadelphia for the Athletics' final season.\n\nChicago's [[William Hulbert]], assisted by player [[Albert Spalding]] and sportswriter [[Lewis Meacham]], moved at the same time to organize a new league. Hulbert recruited first the [[St. Louis Brown Stockings]] of the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]], independent clubs from Louisville and Cincinnati (the [[Louisville Grays]] and [[Cincinnati Reds]]), and four eastern clubs: the Athletics, the [[New York Mutuals]], the [[Hartford Dark Blues]], and the [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Red Stockings]].

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nThe municipality of Bamban is the southernmost gateway of the melting pot province of Tarlac in the Central Plain of Luzon in the Philippines.\n\nBeing the southernmost town in the province, it has a common boundary with [[Mabalacat, Pampanga]], and in the west, with [[Zambales]]. The boundary is defined by the [[Parua River]], which is a source of irrigation water, food, and sand and gravel for infrastructure projects. The mountainous region situated in the western part comprises almost two-thirds of the total land area, which used to be within the US Military Reservations. Nestled in this part are the BLISS projects and to the north, the MAR settlement project, which when completely developed will be a source of livelihood and food supplies for Central Luzon.\n\nBamban is {{convert|99|km}} from Manila and is {{convert|25|km}} from the provincial capital, [[Tarlac City]].\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\n\nLong before settlers came, the place which was to become the town of  Bamban, was a vast track of wild land extending eastward; and on the west side, composed of foothills and mountains lush with vegetation and tall trees extending deep into the Zambales ranges. The thick forest and mountains were then inhabited by the Aetas (locally known as Baluga), and the [[Zambal]], both of whom subsisted only on fishing and native or wild animals which abounded in the place. Occasionally, daring traders from  Pampanga and the Tagalog province, mostly enterprising [[Chinese Filipinos|Chinese]], braved the wilderness to go northward to Capas and Tarlac.\n\nBefore the advent of the Spanish era, small settlers came, attracted by the fertile land and the glittering silver of the river that cut through the mountain to spill down the flat land, making it fertile. The settlers started small clearings in the thick growth of bamban plants which covered vast portions of the land bordering the river a small distance from the foothills.(because of these plants, the place was eventually named Bamban).\n\nSettlers upon settlers came to carve clearings in the land, and soon a small community was formed. About 1700, Agustinian Recollects came and established the Mission de Pueblos de Bamban. But the pueblo was then a part of Pampanga. In 1837, a new boundary line was established, thereby permanently making Bamban part of the province of Tarlac.\n\nOfficial recognition as a town was sanctioned by the gobernadorcillo in the town of  Tarlac. Don Mart\u00edn Sibal was subsequently appointed head and commissioned with the rank of \"Capit\u00e1n\". Among the first settlers were the Sibal, Lugtu, Dayrit, Macale, Vergara, Manipon, and de la Cruz clans.\n\n[[File:Pinatubo91 children on roof in bamban 10-12-91.jpg|thumb|left|Children on roof of a school in Bamban, that was buried by lahars during the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo.]]\n\nDuring the revolution of 1896, Bamban was one of the first towns to take up arms against the Spaniards. Northwest of the town situated among the hills are remnants of strongholds built by brave bands of Bambanenses who joined Gen. Servilliano Aquino in the uprising in Tarlac. Up to this time, a portion of the foothills in the area is called \"Batiawan\" or look-out point. Many a brave son died in this movement for liberation.\n\nWhen the Americans came in 1900, the small pueblo gradually grew into a teeming town. The Bamban Sugar Central was established and further gave impetus to its growth. Don Pablo Lagman was the first to be appointed presidente and Don Laureano Campo as vice-presidente under the American military government. Other prominent families then took over the helm of government. During the Commonwealth era, the Sibals, the Lumboys, the Santoses, the Punsalangs, to mention a few, enjoyed political power until the outbreak of World War II.\n\nBamban was like the legendary phoenix, which locals felt must be resurrected from its ashes. The whole ''poblaci\u00f3n'' was devastated and burned during the liberation. Undaunted, the people returned from hiding and began rebuilding even while the campaign was raging deep in the mountains. Growth was fast because of  proximity of Clark Air Base. But Bamban can not be the same again. The aftermath of the war was felt for a long time. Consequently, prominent families left the town for the city to establish big business and names for themselves.\n\nThe 1991 [[Mount Pinatubo]] volcanic eruption and the subsequent flow of lava and [[mud]] to the lowlands of Bamban forced residents to move out or to stay at the Dapdap Resettlement Area, which is on higher grounds.\n\n==Barangays==\n[[File:Bamban,Tarlacjf7798 02.JPG|thumb|Dolores Grotto view of the Bamban bridge and barangays]]\n\nBamban is politically subdivided into 15 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* Anupul  \n* Banaba \n* Bangcu \n* Culubasa \n* Dela Cruz \n* La Paz \n* Lourdes \n* Malonzo \n* San Nicolas ([[poblacion]]) \n* San Pedro \n* San Rafael \n* San Roque \n* San Vicente \n* Santo Ni\u00f1o \n* Virgen de los Remedios (Pacalcal)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Bamban\n| 1903 = 3002\n| 1918 = 4846\n| 1939 = 9663\n| 1948 = 11553\n| 1960 = 13527\n| 1970 = 18474\n| 1975 = 22723\n| 1980 = 26072\n| 1990 = 35639\n| 1995 = 37115\n| 2000 = 46360 \n| 2007 = 61644\n| 2010 = 62413\n| 2015 = 69466\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Bamban, Tarlac, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==Attractions and points of interest==\n[[File:Bamban,Tarlacjf7967 01.JPG|thumbnail|Santo Ni\u00f1o Parish Church]]\n\n* At the center of the town is the heritage (F-1812) Santo Ni\u00f1o Parish Church of Bamban<ref>{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Santo_Ni%C3%B1o_Parish_Church_of_Bamban |title=Category:Santo Ni\u00f1o Parish Church of Bamban - Wikimedia Commons |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |date= |accessdate=2019-10-16}}</ref> (Vicariate of San Nicolas de Tolentino; Vicar Forane: Msgr.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nThe municipality of Bamban is the southernmost gateway of the melting pot province of Tarlac in the Central Plain of Luzon in the Philippines.\n\nBeing the southernmost town in the province, it has a common boundary with [[Mabalacat, Pampanga]], and in the west, with [[Zambales]]. The boundary is defined by the [[Parua River]], which is a source of irrigation water, food, and sand and gravel for infrastructure projects. The mountainous region situated in the western part comprises almost two-thirds of the total land area, which used to be within the US Military Reservations. Nestled in this part are the BLISS projects and to the north, the MAR settlement project, which when completely developed will be a source of livelihood and food supplies for Central Luzon.\n\nBamban is {{convert|99|km}} from Manila and is {{convert|25|km}} from the provincial capital, [[Tarlac City]].\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\n\nLong before settlers came, the place which was to become the town of  Bamban, was a vast track of wild land extending eastward; and on the west side, composed of foothills and mountains lush with vegetation and tall trees extending deep into the Zambales ranges. The thick forest and mountains were then inhabited by the Aetas (locally known as Baluga), and the [[Zambal]], both of whom subsisted only on fishing and native or wild animals which abounded in the place. Occasionally, daring traders from  Pampanga and the Tagalog province, mostly enterprising [[Chinese Filipinos|Chinese]], braved the wilderness to go northward to Capas and Tarlac.\n\nBefore the advent of the Spanish era, small settlers came, attracted by the fertile land and the glittering silver of the river that cut through the mountain to spill down the flat land, making it fertile. The settlers started small clearings in the thick growth of bamban plants which covered vast portions of the land bordering the river a small distance from the foothills.(because of these plants, the place was eventually named Bamban).\n\nSettlers upon settlers came to carve clearings in the land, and soon a small community was formed. About 1700, Agustinian Recollects came and established the Mission de Pueblos de Bamban. But the pueblo was then a part of Pampanga. In 1837, a new boundary line was established, thereby permanently making Bamban part of the province of Tarlac.\n\nOfficial recognition as a town was sanctioned by the gobernadorcillo in the town of  Tarlac. Don Mart\u00edn Sibal was subsequently appointed head and commissioned with the rank of \"Capit\u00e1n\". Among the first settlers were the Sibal, Lugtu, Dayrit, Macale, Vergara, Manipon, and de la Cruz clans.\n\n[[File:Pinatubo91 children on roof in bamban 10-12-91.jpg|thumb|left|Children on roof of a school in Bamban, that was buried by lahars during the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo.]]\n\nDuring the revolution of 1896, Bamban was one of the first towns to take up arms against the Spaniards. Northwest of the town situated among the hills are remnants of strongholds built by brave bands of Bambanenses who joined Gen. Servilliano Aquino in the uprising in Tarlac. Up to this time, a portion of the foothills in the area is called \"Batiawan\" or look-out point. Many a brave son died in this movement for liberation.\n\nWhen the Americans came in 1900, the small pueblo gradually grew into a teeming town. The Bamban Sugar Central was established and further gave impetus to its growth. Don Pablo Lagman was the first to be appointed presidente and Don Laureano Campo as vice-presidente under the American military government. Other prominent families then took over the helm of government. During the Commonwealth era, the Sibals, the Lumboys, the Santoses, the Punsalangs, to mention a few, enjoyed political power until the outbreak of World War II.\n\nBamban was like the legendary phoenix, which locals felt must be resurrected from its ashes. The whole ''poblaci\u00f3n'' was devastated and burned during the liberation. Undaunted, the people returned from hiding and began rebuilding even while the campaign was raging deep in the mountains. Growth was fast because of  proximity of Clark Air Base. But Bamban can not be the same again. The aftermath of the war was felt for a long time. Consequently, prominent families left the town for the city to establish big business and names for themselves.\n\nThe 1991 [[Mount Pinatubo]] volcanic eruption and the subsequent flow of lava and [[mud]] to the lowlands of Bamban forced residents to move out or to stay at the Dapdap Resettlement Area, which is on higher grounds.\n\n==Barangays==\n[[File:Bamban,Tarlacjf7798 02.JPG|thumb|Dolores Grotto view of the Bamban bridge and barangays]]\n\nBamban is politically subdivided into 15 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* Anupul  \n* Banaba \n* Bangcu \n* Culubasa \n* Dela Cruz \n* La Paz \n* Lourdes \n* Malonzo \n* San Nicolas ([[poblacion]]) \n* San Pedro \n* San Rafael \n* San Roque \n* San Vicente \n* Santo Ni\u00f1o \n* Virgen de los Remedios (Pacalcal)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Bamban\n| 1903 = 3002\n| 1918 = 4846\n| 1939 = 9663\n| 1948 = 11553\n| 1960 = 13527\n| 1970 = 18474\n| 1975 = 22723\n| 1980 = 26072\n| 1990 = 35639\n| 1995 = 37115\n| 2000 = 46360 \n| 2007 = 61644\n| 2010 = 62413\n| 2015 = 69466\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Bamban, Tarlac, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==Attractions and points of interest==\n[[File:Bamban,Tarlacjf7967 01.JPG|thumbnail|Santo Ni\u00f1o Parish Church]]\n\n* At the center of the town is the heritage (F-1812) Santo Ni\u00f1o Parish Church of Bamban<ref>{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Santo_Ni%C3%B1o_Parish_Church_of_Bamban |title=Category:Santo Ni\u00f1o Parish Church of Bamban - Wikimedia Commons |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |date= |accessdate=2019-10-16}}</ref> (Vicariate of San Nicolas de Tolentino; Vicar Forane: Msgr.

Later they each record a segment of the podcast with Ru and Michelle and talk about how they feel they have improved from their original season among other things. \n\nThe next day on the main stage the queens perform their verses of \"Super Queen\" with [[Chad Michaels]], [[Alaska Thunderfuck]], and [[Trixie Mattel]] performing alongside them (having visited them in the workroom the day before). The queens are then praised by the judges on their runway looks with particular praise for Mon\u00e9t and Trinity. The judges then deliberate and decide that Mon\u00e9t and Trinity should be the top two All Stars. The pair then lipsync to \"[[Fighter (Christina Aguilera song)|Fighter]]\" by [[Christina Aguilera]] with both being declared winners for the first in the franchise's history, and winning a prize of $100,000 each.\n\n*'''Guest Judges''': [[Todrick Hall]]\n*'''Main Challenge''': Write, record, and perform a verse to the remix of RuPaul's song ''Super Queen''\n*'''Runway Theme''': All Star

In addition to this they also have to record a segment with Michelle and Ru for their podcast 'What's The Tee?'. The queens choreograph the dance moves for the routine with [[Todrick Hall]]. Later they each record a segment of the podcast with Ru and Michelle and talk about how they feel they have improved from their original season among other things. \n\nThe next day on the main stage the queens perform their verses of \"Super Queen\" with [[Chad Michaels]], [[Alaska Thunderfuck]], and [[Trixie Mattel]] performing alongside them (having visited them in the workroom the day before). The queens are then praised by the judges on their runway looks with particular praise for Mon\u00e9t and Trinity. The judges then deliberate and decide that Mon\u00e9t and Trinity should be the top two All Stars. The pair then lipsync to \"[[Fighter (Christina Aguilera song)|Fighter]]\" by [[Christina Aguilera]] with both being declared winners for the first in the franchise's history, and winning a prize of $100,000 each.\n\n*'''Guest Judges''': [[Todrick Hall]]\n*'''Main Challenge''': Write, record, and perform a verse to the remix of RuPaul's song ''Super Queen''\n*'''Runway Theme''': All Star

On one occasion he hit 6 home runs in one game.<ref name=\"google1\" />\n\nHowever, it was soon brought to light that he and two other Philadelphia players were being given $20 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|20|1866|r=-1}}}} in current dollar terms) a week<!--compared to how much for a factory worker?

In the end, no one showed up to the hearing, and the matter was dropped. By {{baseball year|1869}}, the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] became the first openly professional team, and Pike's hearing, farcical as it seems to have been, paved the way for [[Harry Wright]]'s professionalization of baseball.  The Athletics were very successful, but Pike was dropped from the team in 1867, because he was from New York, and thus a 'foreigner,' calling his loyalty into question.\n\nHe moved on to the [[Irvington, New Jersey]] club and later in 1867 to the [[New York Mutuals]], always a leading team, where he returned for 1868, having caught the eye of [[Boss Tweed]]. In 1869 he moved to the [[Brooklyn Atlantics]], another perennial leader, where he hit .610.  In {{baseball year|1870}}, the Atlantics, with Pike manning [[second base]], finally ended Cincinnati's 93-game winning streak.\n\n===National Association===\nIn {{baseball year|1871}}, the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]] was formed as the first professional baseball league, and Pike joined the [[Troy Haymakers]] for its inaugural season.  He was their star and for 4 games was the captain and [[manager]],<ref name=\"google2\" /> [[batting average (baseball)|batting]] .377 (6th best in the league) and hitting a league-leading 4 home runs.<ref name=autogenerated2>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/pikeli01.shtml Lip Pike Stats | Baseball-Reference.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  He also led the league in  [[extra base hits]] (21), and was 2nd in [[slugging percentage]] (.654) and [[double (baseball)|double]]s (10), 4th in [[RBI]]s (39), 5th in [[triple (baseball)|triple]]s (7), 6th in [[on-base percentage]] (.400), 9th in [[hit (baseball)|hit]]s (49), and 10th in [[run (baseball)|run]]s (43).<ref name=autogenerated2 /> The Haymakers only finished 6th, though, and the team's captaincy switched to [[Bill Craver]].\n\nThe Haymakers revamped their roster for the {{baseball year|1872}} season, and Pike headed for [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], where he played for the [[Baltimore Canaries]]. Pike had another excellent season, leading the league in home runs again (with 6), RBIs (60), and games (56), and coming in 2nd in [[total bases]] (127) and extra base hits (26), 3rd in [[at bat]]s (288), 5th in doubles (15) and triples (5), 9th in slugging percentage (.441) and [[stolen base]]s (8), and 10th in hits (84).<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nIn {{baseball year|1873}}, Pike led the league in home runs for the 3rd consecutive season, hitting 4, and was 2nd in triples (8), 4th in total bases (132), stolen bases (8), and extra base hits (26), 7th in slugging percentage (.462), 8th in doubles (14), RBIs (50), and at bats (286), 9th in hits (90), and 10th in games (56).<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nPike was also one of the fastest players in the league.  He would occasionally race any challenger for a cash prize, routinely coming out the winner.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=axNYROJTahwC&pg=PA103&dq=%22lip+pike%22#v=onepage&q=%22lip%20pike%22&f=false |title=Major League Baseball in Gilded Age Connecticut: The Rise and Fall of the Middletown, New Haven and Hartford Clubs |publisher=|date= 2009-12-03|accessdate=February 1, 2011|isbn=9780786436774 |last1=Arcidiacono |first1=David }}</ref> On August 16, 1873, he raced a fast [[trotting horse]] named \"Clarence\" in a 100-yard sprint at Baltimore's [[Newington Park]], and won by four yards with a time of 10 seconds flat, earning $250 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|250|1873|r=-2}}}} today).<ref name=\"google2\"/>\n\nBaltimore went [[bankrupt]] after the season, so Pike headed off to captain the [[Hartford Dark Blues]] for the 1874 season.  The Dark Blues were a poor team, but Pike had another fine season, slugging .574 to lead the league, and coming in 2nd with an [[on-base percentage]] of .368.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nPike abandoned the weak Hartford team after a single season, switching to the [[St. Louis Brown Stockings]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />  For the first time in his professional career, Pike failed to hit a home run, although he stole 25 bases.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  He also hit 12 triples and 22 doubles (leading the league) in what was probably his finest offensive season.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nIn all, Lip Pike has the National Association career home run (15) and extra base hits (135) records.\n\n===National League===\n[[File:1876 St. Louis Brown Stockings.jpg|280px|thumb|1876 St. Louis Brown Stockings, with Lip Pike in the second row, 4th from the left]]\nIn {{baseball year|1876}}, when the [[National League]] replaced the National Association, Pike stuck with St. Louis.  The Brown Stockings turned in a very good season, finishing a solid 2nd to the [[Chicago White Stockings (1870\u201389)|Chicago White Stockings]].  Pike continued to produce offensively, notching totals of 133 total bases (5th in the league) and 34 extra-base hits (2nd).<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nSeemingly never content to stay with a team very long, Pike headed to the [[Cincinnati Reds (1876\u20131879)|Cincinnati Reds]] for the {{baseball year|1877}} season.  The Reds finished last. Pike was still a top-quality player, leading the league in home runs for the 4th time in the 1870s.<ref name=\"google4\"/>  However, age was starting to catch up with the 32-year-old Pike.  He began the season as the 8th-oldest player in the league, and was the 4th-oldest player of the 1878 season.  The 1878 Reds played very well, though.  They finished 2nd, but Pike was replaced by [[Buttercup Dickerson]] halfway through the season and forced to look elsewhere for a team.  He ended up playing a few games for the [[Providence Grays]], and spent the next two years playing for minor league teams.\n\n''[[Sporting Life (American newspaper)|Sporting Life]]'' subsequently named him an outfielder on its 1870\u201380 All-Star team.<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n\nPike got a brief call-up in 1881 to play for the [[Worcester Ruby Legs]],<ref name=\"google5\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LADOUweLXPsC&pg=PA80&dq=%22lip+pike%22#v=onepage&q=%22lip%20pike%22&f=false |title=Jewish heroes & heroines of America: 151 true stories of Jewish American heroism |publisher= |date= 2004|author=Seymour Brody|accessdate=February 1, 2011|isbn=9780883910269 }}</ref> but the 36-year-old Pike could no longer play effectively, hitting .111 and not managing a single extra base hit in 18 [[at-bat]]s over 5 games.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  His play was so poor as to arouse suspicions, and Pike found himself banned from the National League that September. He was added to the [[National League]] blacklist in 1881.  He turned to [[haberdashery]],<ref name=\"google5\"/> the vocation of his father, and spent another 6 years playing only amateur baseball.  He was reinstated in 1883.\n\n===American Association===\nIn [[1887 in baseball|1887]], the [[New York Metropolitans]] of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] gave Pike another chance.  At 42, he was the oldest player in baseball.

In the end, no one showed up to the hearing, and the matter was dropped.  By {{baseball year|1869}}, the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] became the first openly professional team, and Pike's hearing, farcical as it seems to have been, paved the way for [[Harry Wright]]'s professionalization of baseball.  The Athletics were very successful, but Pike was dropped from the team in 1867, because he was from New York, and thus a 'foreigner,' calling his loyalty into question.\n\nHe moved on to the [[Irvington, New Jersey]] club and later in 1867 to the [[New York Mutuals]], always a leading team, where he returned for 1868, having caught the eye of [[Boss Tweed]]. In 1869 he moved to the [[Brooklyn Atlantics]], another perennial leader, where he hit .610.  In {{baseball year|1870}}, the Atlantics, with Pike manning [[second base]], finally ended Cincinnati's 93-game winning streak.\n\n===National Association===\nIn {{baseball year|1871}}, the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players|National Association]] was formed as the first professional baseball league, and Pike joined the [[Troy Haymakers]] for its inaugural season.  He was their star and for 4 games was the captain and [[manager]],<ref name=\"google2\"/> [[batting average (baseball)|batting]] .377 (6th best in the league) and hitting a league-leading 4 home runs.<ref name=autogenerated2>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/pikeli01.shtml Lip Pike Stats | Baseball-Reference.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  He also led the league in  [[extra base hits]] (21), and was 2nd in [[slugging percentage]] (.654) and [[double (baseball)|double]]s (10), 4th in [[RBI]]s (39), 5th in [[triple (baseball)|triple]]s (7), 6th in [[on-base percentage]] (.400), 9th in [[hit (baseball)|hit]]s (49), and 10th in [[run (baseball)|run]]s (43).<ref name=autogenerated2 />  The Haymakers only finished 6th, though, and the team's captaincy switched to [[Bill Craver]].\n\nThe Haymakers revamped their roster for the {{baseball year|1872}} season, and Pike headed for [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], where he played for the [[Baltimore Canaries]].  Pike had another excellent season, leading the league in home runs again (with 6), RBIs (60), and games (56), and coming in 2nd in [[total bases]] (127) and extra base hits (26), 3rd in [[at bat]]s (288), 5th in doubles (15) and triples (5), 9th in slugging percentage (.441) and [[stolen base]]s (8), and 10th in hits (84).<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nIn {{baseball year|1873}}, Pike led the league in home runs for the 3rd consecutive season, hitting 4, and was 2nd in triples (8), 4th in total bases (132), stolen bases (8), and extra base hits (26), 7th in slugging percentage (.462), 8th in doubles (14), RBIs (50), and at bats (286), 9th in hits (90), and 10th in games (56).<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nPike was also one of the fastest players in the league.

The Dark Blues were a poor team, but Pike had another fine season, slugging .574 to lead the league, and coming in 2nd with an [[on-base percentage]] of .368.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nPike abandoned the weak Hartford team after a single season, switching to the [[St. Louis Brown Stockings]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />  For the first time in his professional career, Pike failed to hit a home run, although he stole 25 bases.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  He also hit 12 triples and 22 doubles (leading the league) in what was probably his finest offensive season.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nIn all, Lip Pike has the National Association career home run (15) and extra base hits (135) records.\n\n===National League===\n[[File:1876 St. Louis Brown Stockings.jpg|280px|thumb|1876 St. Louis Brown Stockings, with Lip Pike in the second row, 4th from the left]]\nIn {{baseball year|1876}}, when the [[National League]] replaced the National Association, Pike stuck with St. Louis.  The Brown Stockings turned in a very good season, finishing a solid 2nd to the [[Chicago White Stockings (1870\u201389)|Chicago White Stockings]].  Pike continued to produce offensively, notching totals of 133 total bases (5th in the league) and 34 extra-base hits (2nd).<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nSeemingly never content to stay with a team very long, Pike headed to the [[Cincinnati Reds (1876\u20131879)|Cincinnati Reds]] for the {{baseball year|1877}} season.  The Reds finished last. Pike was still a top-quality player, leading the league in home runs for the 4th time in the 1870s.<ref name=\"google4\"/>  However, age was starting to catch up with the 32-year-old Pike.  He began the season as the 8th-oldest player in the league, and was the 4th-oldest player of the 1878 season.  The 1878 Reds played very well, though.  They finished 2nd, but Pike was replaced by [[Buttercup Dickerson]] halfway through the season and forced to look elsewhere for a team.  He ended up playing a few games for the [[Providence Grays]], and spent the next two years playing for minor league teams.\n\n''[[Sporting Life (American newspaper)|Sporting Life]]'' subsequently named him an outfielder on its 1870\u201380 All-Star team.<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n\nPike got a brief call-up in 1881 to play for the [[Worcester Ruby Legs]],<ref name=\"google5\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LADOUweLXPsC&pg=PA80&dq=%22lip+pike%22#v=onepage&q=%22lip%20pike%22&f=false |title=Jewish heroes & heroines of America: 151 true stories of Jewish American heroism |publisher= |date= 2004|author=Seymour Brody|accessdate=February 1, 2011|isbn=9780883910269 }}</ref> but the 36-year-old Pike could no longer play effectively, hitting .111 and not managing a single extra base hit in 18 [[at-bat]]s over 5 games.<ref name=autogenerated2 />  His play was so poor as to arouse suspicions, and Pike found himself banned from the National League that September. He was added to the [[National League]] blacklist in 1881.  He turned to [[haberdashery]],<ref name=\"google5\"/> the vocation of his father, and spent another 6 years playing only amateur baseball.  He was reinstated in 1883.\n\n===American Association===\nIn [[1887 in baseball|1887]], the [[New York Metropolitans]] of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] gave Pike another chance.  At 42, he was the oldest player in baseball.  The only game he played was more of a sending off than a new start, though, and Pike headed back to his haberdashery once more.\n\n==Death==\n\nPike died suddenly of [[heart disease]] at the age of 48 in 1893.<ref name=\"google1\"/>  ''[[The Brooklyn Eagle]]'' reported that \"Many wealthy Hebrews and men high in political and old time baseball circles attended the funeral service\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4qOXgcdTaUC&pg=PA147&dq=%22lip+pike%22#v=onepage&q=%22lip%20pike%22&f=false |title=Long before the Dodgers: baseball in Brooklyn, 1855\u20131884|publisher=|year=2002 |accessdate=February 1, 2011|isbn=9780786412297|last1=Terry|first1=James L.}}</ref>  He was interred in the [[Salem Fields Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]].\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1936, decades after he died, Pike received a vote in the elections for the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n\nPike was inducted into the [[International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame]] in 1985.<ref name=sabr-bio />\n\nPike was inducted into the New York State Baseball Hall of Fame - Class of 2016\n\n{{As of|2018}}, Pike has been one of seven Jewish managers in MLB history.<ref name=sabr-bio1>Ryan Lawrence (October 31, 2017).
