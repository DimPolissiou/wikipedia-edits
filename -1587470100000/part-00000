But her real inspiration was the artist Frederic Fiebig<ref> Allen, pp. 74-75</ref> and due to him, she began to work in a style new to her that involved using the palette knife and a heavier application of paint. Her works of art in this mode were acknowledged and she was invited to display her paintings at the Salon des Beaux Arts.<ref name=\"cwahi.concordia.ca\" /> Not long later, it is said, the artist was voted as president of the International Union.<ref name=\":2\" />  In the later years of McGillivray's life she joined the [[Ontario Society of Artists]] (1917), she was elected an Associate member of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]](1924),<ref name=\":1\" /> and was a Charter member of the Canadian Society of Painters in Watercolour and its first woman member (1925). <ref name=\"images.ourontario.ca\" />\n\n== Influence and Style ==\n[[File:St. Anthony Harbour, Newfoundland, Florence H.

Her artwork is expressed mainly with vivid colours of contouring shapes and dabs of paint that simplifies the form of an object.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Later Years==\nMcGillivray traveled extensively in search of new landscape scenery to paint. In 1930, by then in her mid-60s, McGillivray bought a house in Toronto where she retired.<ref name=\":1\" /> She continued to paint primarily from the sketches she had accumulated from around the world. As a landscape painter, McGillivray found some prestige and recognition while alive, but not quite as much as Thomson though she had encouraged him in his modernist path. Painting landscapes in a modernist style was not something expected from a woman in the early 1900s. McGillivray never married and left no children.

In 1930, by then in her mid-60s, McGillivray bought a house in Toronto where she retired.<ref name=\":1\" /> She continued to paint primarily from the sketches she had accumulated from around the world. As a landscape painter, McGillivray found some prestige and recognition while alive, but not quite as much as Thomson though she had encouraged him in his modernist path. Painting landscapes in a modernist style was not something expected from a woman in the early 1900s. McGillivray never married and left no children. She died at age 74 in Toronto, on May 7, 1938.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Allen, Bill. \"Up the Gatineau!\" ''Following Florence'' XLII, 2016.\n* Art Gallery of Ontario. \"The Canadian Collection.\" ''Art Gallery of Ontario'', 288-289.

Important thinkers in this regard have been [[Vannevar Bush]] and [[Theodor Nelson]], whereas comparable ideas can be found in the literary works of [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Italo Calvino]], and [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]].\n\n==Themes==\nIn the book ''New Media Art'', [[Mark Tribe]] and Reena Jana named several themes that contemporary new media art addresses, including [[computer art]], [[collaboration]], [[Personal identity|identity]], [[appropriation (art)|appropriation]], [[Open source|open sourcing]], [[telepresence]], surveillance, corporate parody, as well as intervention and [[hacktivism]].<ref>{{citation\n| url=https://wiki.brown.edu/confluence/display/MarkTribe/New+Media+Art+-+Introduction\n| title= New Media Art, Introduction\n| year=2007\n| author=[[Mark Tribe]], Reena Jana\n| publisher=Taschen\n| location=Rome\n| isbn=978-3-8228-2537-2\n}}</ref> In the book ''Postdigitale'',<ref>{{citation\n| title=Postdigitale\n| url=http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm\n| year=2008\n| author=Maurizio Bolognini\n| language=Italian\n| publisher=Carocci Editore\n| location=Rome\n| isbn=978-88-430-4739-0\n| author-link=Maurizio Bolognini\n}}</ref> [[Maurizio Bolognini]] suggested that new media artists have one common denominator, which is a self-referential relationship with the new technologies, the result of finding oneself inside an epoch-making transformation determined by technological development. Nevertheless, new media art does not appear as a set of homogeneous practices, but as a complex field converging around three main elements: 1) the art system, 2) scientific and industrial research, and 3) political-cultural media activism.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Catrical\u00e0|first1=Valentino|title=Media Art.

Towards a post-digital generative art\"], ''Artmedia X Proceedings''. Paris, 2010.</ref> This should be taken into account in examining the several themes addressed by new media art.\n\nNon-linearity can be seen as an important topic to new media art by artists developing interactive, generative, collaborative, immersive artworks like [[Jeffrey Shaw]] or [[Maurice Benayoun]] who explored the term as an approach to looking at varying forms of digital projects where the content relays on the user's experience. This is a key concept since people acquired the notion that they were conditioned to view everything in a linear and clear-cut fashion.  Now, art is stepping out of that form and allowing for people to build their own experiences with the piece. Non-linearity describes a project that escape from the conventional linear narrative coming from novels, theater plays and movies. Non-linear art usually requires audience participation or at least, the fact that the \"visitor\" is taken into consideration by the representation, altering the displayed content. The participatory aspect of new media art, which for some artists has become integral, emerged from [[Allan Kaprow]]'s ''Happenings'' and became with Internet, a significant component of contemporary art.\n\nThe inter-connectivity and interactivity of the [[internet]], as well as the fight between corporate interests, governmental interests, and public interests that gave birth to the web today, inspire a lot of current new media art.\n\nMany new media art projects also work with themes like politics and social consciousness, allowing for [[social activism]] through the interactive nature of the media. New media art includes \"explorations of code and user interface; interrogations of archives, databases, and networks; production via automated scraping, filtering, cloning, and recombinatory techniques; applications of user-generated content (UGC) layers; crowdsourcing ideas on social- media platforms; narrowcasting digital selves on \"free\" websites that claim copyright; and provocative performances that implicate audiences as participants\".<ref>Dale Hudson and Patricia R.

New York: Palgrave Macmillan. P. 1. {{ISBN|978-1137433626}}</ref>\n\nOne of the key themes in new media art is to create visual views of databases. Pioneers in this area include [[Lisa Strausfeld]], [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]]<ref>\n{{cite book|last1=Bulajic|first1=Viktorija Vesna| title=Database aesthetics: art in the age of information overflow|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2007|url=|isbn=}}\n</ref> and Alberto Frigo.<ref>{{cite book |last=Moulon |first=Dominique |date=2013 |title=Contemporary new media art  |url= |location= |publisher=Nouvelles \u00e9ditions Scala |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref> Database aesthetics holds at least two attractions to new media artists: formally, as a new variation on non-linear narratives; and politically as a means to subvert what is fast becoming a form of control and authority.\n\nThe emergence of [[3D printing]] has introduced a new bridge to new media art, joining the virtual and the physical worlds.  The rise of this technology has allowed artists to blend the computational base of new media art with the traditional physical form of sculpture.  A pioneer in this field was artist [[Jonty Hurwitz]] who created the first known anamorphosis sculpture using this technique.\n\n<gallery widths=\"154px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Themes\">\nFile:A-Soapopera-for-iMacs.jpg|[[G.H.

Sculpture with a Robotic Arm.\"\n</gallery>\n\n==Longevity ==\nAs the technologies used to deliver works of new media art such as [[photographic film|film]], [[cassette tape|tapes]], [[web browser]]s, [[software]] and [[operating system]]s become obsolete, New Media art faces serious issues around the challenge to [[Art conservation and restoration|preserve artwork]] beyond the time of its contemporary production. Currently, research projects into [[New media art preservation]] are underway to improve the preservation and documentation of the fragile media arts heritage (see [[Docam|DOCAM - Documentation and Conservation of the Media Arts Heritage]]).\n\nMethods of preservation exist, including the translation of a work from an obsolete medium into a related new medium,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ercim.org/publication/ws-proceedings/DELOS6/rosetta.pdf|title=Digital Rosetta Stone|website=ercim.org}}</ref> the digital archiving of media (see the [[Rhizome (organization)|Rhizome ArtBase]], which holds over 2000 works, and the [[Internet Archive]]), and the use of [[emulators]] to preserve work dependent on obsolete software or operating system environments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rhizome.org/artbase/report.htm |title=Preserving the Rhizome ArtBase (report) |first=Richard |last=Rinehart |website=rhizome.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050116094312/http://rhizome.org/artbase/report.htm |archivedate=2005-01-16 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/arts/design/the-mission-to-save-vanishing-internet-art.html|title=The Mission to Save Vanishing Internet Art|last=Rose|first=Frank|date=2016-10-21|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-14}}</ref>\n\nAround the mid-90s, the issue of storing works in digital form became a concern. Digital art such as moving images, multimedia, interactive programs, and computer-generated art has different properties than physical artwork such as oil paintings and sculptures. Unlike analog technologies, a digital file can be recopied onto a new medium without any deterioration of content. One of the problems with preserving digital art is that the formats continuously change over time. Former examples of transitions include that from 8-inch floppy disks to 5.25-inch floppies, 3-inch diskettes to CD-ROMs, and DVDs to flash drives. On the horizon is the obsolescence of flash drives and portable hard drives, as data is increasingly held in online [[cloud storage]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://besser.tsoa.nyu.edu/howard/Papers/elect-art-longevity.html|title=Longevity of Electronic Art|website=besser.tsoa.nyu.edu|access-date=2017-12-07}}</ref>\n\nMuseums and galleries thrive off of being able to accommodate the presentation and preservation of physical artwork. New media art challenges the original methods of the art world when it comes to documentation, its approach to collection and preservation. Technology continues to advance, and the nature and structure of art organizations and institutions will remain in jeopardy. The traditional roles of curators and artist are continually changing, and a shift to new collaborative models of production and presentation is needed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New media in the white cube and beyond : curatorial models for digital art|date=2008|publisher=University of California Press|others=Paul, Christiane.|isbn=9780520255975|location=Berkeley|oclc=225871513}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nIn New Media programs, students are able to get acquainted with the newest forms of creation and communication.

From the 1920s through the 1950s, various forms of kinetic and light art, from [[Thomas Wilfred]]'s 'Lumia' (1919) and 'Clavilux' light organs to [[Jean Tinguely]]'s self-destructing sculpture 'Homage to New York' (1960) can be seen as progenitors of new media art.\n\nIn 1958 [[Wolf Vostell]] became the first artist to incorporate a [[television]] set into their work, when he included one in his ''Black Room Cycle''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/deutscher-ausblick/|title=Media Art Net - Vostell, Wolf: German View from the Black Room Cycle|work=medienkunstnetz.de}}</ref> This [[Installation art|installation]] is part of the collection of the [[Berlinische Galerie]].\n\nDuring the 1960s the development of then new technologies of video produced the new media art experiments of [[Nam June Paik]], and [[Wolf Vostell]] with the [[Installation art|installation]] ''6 TV D\u00e9-coll/age'' in 1963 at the [[Smolin Gallery]] in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/television-decollage/|title=Media Art Net - Vostell, Wolf: Television D\u00e9collage|work=medienkunstnetz.de}}</ref> [[A.

Important thinkers in this regard have been [[Vannevar Bush]] and [[Theodor Nelson]], whereas comparable ideas can be found in the literary works of [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Italo Calvino]], and [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]].\n\n==Themes==\nIn the book ''New Media Art'', [[Mark Tribe]] and Reena Jana named several themes that contemporary new media art addresses, including [[computer art]], [[collaboration]], [[Personal identity|identity]], [[appropriation (art)|appropriation]], [[Open source|open sourcing]], [[telepresence]], surveillance, corporate parody, as well as intervention and [[hacktivism]].<ref>{{citation\n| url=https://wiki.brown.edu/confluence/display/MarkTribe/New+Media+Art+-+Introduction\n| title= New Media Art, Introduction\n| year=2007\n| author=[[Mark Tribe]], Reena Jana\n| publisher=Taschen\n| location=Rome\n| isbn=978-3-8228-2537-2\n}}</ref> In the book ''Postdigitale'',<ref>{{citation\n| title=Postdigitale\n| url=http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm\n| year=2008\n| author=Maurizio Bolognini\n| language=Italian\n| publisher=Carocci Editore\n| location=Rome\n| isbn=978-88-430-4739-0\n| author-link=Maurizio Bolognini\n}}</ref> [[Maurizio Bolognini]] suggested that new media artists have one common denominator, which is a self-referential relationship with the new technologies, the result of finding oneself inside an epoch-making transformation determined by technological development. Nevertheless, new media art does not appear as a set of homogeneous practices, but as a complex field converging around three main elements: 1) the art system, 2) scientific and industrial research, and 3) political-cultural media activism.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Catrical\u00e0|first1=Valentino|title=Media Art. Toward a new Definition of Arts in the Age of Technology|date=2015|publisher=Gli Ori|isbn=978-88-7336-564-8|url=https://www.academia.edu/11185472}}</ref> There are significant differences between scientist-artists, activist-artists and technological artists closer to the art system, who not only have different training and technocultures, but have different artistic production.<ref>See also [[Maurizio Bolognini]], [http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm \"From interactivity to democracy. Towards a post-digital generative art\"], ''Artmedia X Proceedings''. Paris, 2010.</ref> This should be taken into account in examining the several themes addressed by new media art.\n\nNon-linearity can be seen as an important topic to new media art by artists developing interactive, generative, collaborative, immersive artworks like [[Jeffrey Shaw]] or [[Maurice Benayoun]] who explored the term as an approach to looking at varying forms of digital projects where the content relays on the user's experience. This is a key concept since people acquired the notion that they were conditioned to view everything in a linear and clear-cut fashion.  Now, art is stepping out of that form and allowing for people to build their own experiences with the piece. Non-linearity describes a project that escape from the conventional linear narrative coming from novels, theater plays and movies. Non-linear art usually requires audience participation or at least, the fact that the \"visitor\" is taken into consideration by the representation, altering the displayed content. The participatory aspect of new media art, which for some artists has become integral, emerged from [[Allan Kaprow]]'s ''Happenings'' and became with Internet, a significant component of contemporary art.\n\nThe inter-connectivity and interactivity of the [[internet]], as well as the fight between corporate interests, governmental interests, and public interests that gave birth to the web today, inspire a lot of current new media art.\n\nMany new media art projects also work with themes like politics and social consciousness, allowing for [[social activism]] through the interactive nature of the media. New media art includes \"explorations of code and user interface; interrogations of archives, databases, and networks; production via automated scraping, filtering, cloning, and recombinatory techniques; applications of user-generated content (UGC) layers; crowdsourcing ideas on social- media platforms; narrowcasting digital selves on \"free\" websites that claim copyright; and provocative performances that implicate audiences as participants\".<ref>Dale Hudson and Patricia R.

New York: Palgrave Macmillan. P. 1. {{ISBN|978-1137433626}}</ref>\n\nOne of the key themes in new media art is to create visual views of databases. Pioneers in this area include [[Lisa Strausfeld]], [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]]<ref>\n{{cite book|last1=Bulajic|first1=Viktorija Vesna| title=Database aesthetics: art in the age of information overflow|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2007|url=|isbn=}}\n</ref> and Alberto Frigo.<ref>{{cite book |last=Moulon |first=Dominique |date=2013 |title=Contemporary new media art  |url= |location= |publisher=Nouvelles \u00e9ditions Scala |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}</ref> Database aesthetics holds at least two attractions to new media artists: formally, as a new variation on non-linear narratives; and politically as a means to subvert what is fast becoming a form of control and authority.\n\nThe emergence of [[3D printing]] has introduced a new bridge to new media art, joining the virtual and the physical worlds.  The rise of this technology has allowed artists to blend the computational base of new media art with the traditional physical form of sculpture.  A pioneer in this field was artist [[Jonty Hurwitz]] who created the first known anamorphosis sculpture using this technique.\n\n<gallery widths=\"154px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Themes\">\nFile:A-Soapopera-for-iMacs.jpg|[[G.H.

Sculpture with a Robotic Arm.\"\n</gallery>\n\n==Longevity ==\nAs the technologies used to deliver works of new media art such as [[photographic film|film]], [[cassette tape|tapes]], [[web browser]]s, [[software]] and [[operating system]]s become obsolete, New Media art faces serious issues around the challenge to [[Art conservation and restoration|preserve artwork]] beyond the time of its contemporary production. Currently, research projects into [[New media art preservation]] are underway to improve the preservation and documentation of the fragile media arts heritage (see [[Docam|DOCAM - Documentation and Conservation of the Media Arts Heritage]]).\n\nMethods of preservation exist, including the translation of a work from an obsolete medium into a related new medium,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ercim.org/publication/ws-proceedings/DELOS6/rosetta.pdf|title=Digital Rosetta Stone|website=ercim.org}}</ref> the digital archiving of media (see the [[Rhizome (organization)|Rhizome ArtBase]], which holds over 2000 works, and the [[Internet Archive]]), and the use of [[emulators]] to preserve work dependent on obsolete software or operating system environments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rhizome.org/artbase/report.htm |title=Preserving the Rhizome ArtBase (report) |first=Richard |last=Rinehart |website=rhizome.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050116094312/http://rhizome.org/artbase/report.htm |archivedate=2005-01-16 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/arts/design/the-mission-to-save-vanishing-internet-art.html|title=The Mission to Save Vanishing Internet Art|last=Rose|first=Frank|date=2016-10-21|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-14}}</ref>\n\nAround the mid-90s, the issue of storing works in digital form became a concern. Digital art such as moving images, multimedia, interactive programs, and computer-generated art has different properties than physical artwork such as oil paintings and sculptures. Unlike analog technologies, a digital file can be recopied onto a new medium without any deterioration of content. One of the problems with preserving digital art is that the formats continuously change over time. Former examples of transitions include that from 8-inch floppy disks to 5.25-inch floppies, 3-inch diskettes to CD-ROMs, and DVDs to flash drives. On the horizon is the obsolescence of flash drives and portable hard drives, as data is increasingly held in online [[cloud storage]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://besser.tsoa.nyu.edu/howard/Papers/elect-art-longevity.html|title=Longevity of Electronic Art|website=besser.tsoa.nyu.edu|access-date=2017-12-07}}</ref>\n\nMuseums and galleries thrive off of being able to accommodate the presentation and preservation of physical artwork. New media art challenges the original methods of the art world when it comes to documentation, its approach to collection and preservation. Technology continues to advance, and the nature and structure of art organizations and institutions will remain in jeopardy. The traditional roles of curators and artist are continually changing, and a shift to new collaborative models of production and presentation is needed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=New media in the white cube and beyond : curatorial models for digital art|date=2008|publisher=University of California Press|others=Paul, Christiane.|isbn=9780520255975|location=Berkeley|oclc=225871513}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nIn New Media programs, students are able to get acquainted with the newest forms of creation and communication.

It started on 11 July in [[Ireland]] before taking an anti-clockwise route through France to finish in [[Paris]] on 2 August. [[Marco Pantani]] of {{ct|UNO|1998}} won the overall [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], with {{ct|THR|1998}}'s [[Jan Ullrich]], the defending champion, and {{ct|COF|1998}} rider [[Bobby Julich]] finishing on the podium in second and third respectively.\n\nThe general classification leader's yellow jersey was first awarded to [[Chris Boardman]] of the {{ct|GAN|1998a}} team, who won the prologue in Dublin. Following a crash by Boardman on stage 2 that caused his withdrawal, Ullrich's [[Sprinter (cycling)|sprinter]] teammate [[Erik Zabel]] took the race lead. He lost it the next stage to {{ct|ALM|1998}}'s [[Bo Hamburger]], who took it after being in a [[Breakaway (cycling)|breakaway]]. The day after, the yellow jersey switched to another rider from the same breakaway, Boardman's teammate [[Stuart O'Grady]], who took vital seconds from time bonuses gained in [[intermediate sprint]]s. He held it for a further three stages, until pre-race favourite Ullrich won stage 7's individual time trial, moving him into the overall lead. The next day, [[Laurent Desbiens]] of {{ct|COF|1998}} finished in a breakaway with a large enough margin to put him in the yellow jersey. Ullrich regained the race lead two stages later as the Tour went into the Pyrenees. Following his poor showing in the opening week, Pantani placed second and first, respectively, on the two Pyreneean stages. He then won the first stage in the Alps, stage 15, to replace Ullrich in the yellow jersey, which he maintained until the race's conclusion.\n\nZabel won his third consecutive Tour [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]] and Julich's teammate [[Christophe Rinero]], fourth overall, was the winner of the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. Ullrich was the [[young rider classification in the Tour de France|best young rider]] and the [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|most combative]] was {{ct|CSO|1998}}'s [[Jacky Durand]]. The [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]] was won by {{ct|COF|1998|nolink=yes}}. [[Tom Steels]] of {{ct|MAP|1998}} won the most stages, with four.\n\nThe race was marred throughout its run by a doping scandal, commonly known as the [[Festina affair]]. Before the Tour began, [[Willy Voet]], ''[[soigneur]]'' of the [[Festina (cycling team)|Festina team]], was arrested at the Franco-Belgian border when doping products were found in his car. The affair broadened and the team was expelled after top personnel admitted to widespread doping. Police raids on numerous teams during the course of the race led to two riders' strikes and the withdrawal of several teams and riders. Due to the controversy, the race became known by the nickname \"'''Tour de Farce'''\". In July 2013, retrospective tests for [[recombinant EPO]] made in 2004 were made public, revealing that 44 out of 60 of samples returned positive tests.\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 1998 Tour de France}}\n\n[[File:Dubl\u00edn - Trinity College - 20170826172210.jpg|thumb|alt=A gated large stone building with a clock tower on its roof|[[Trinity College Dublin]] in Ireland hosted the team presentation ceremony on 10 July.]]\nThe organisers of the Tour, [[Amaury Sport Organisation]] (ASO), decided to reduce the number of [[Cycling team|teams]] from 22 to 21 for the 1998 Tour.

After a warm start in Grenoble, the weather soon deteriorated, with cold temperatures, rain and fog impeding the riders. The route contained four classified climbs, including the ''hors categorie'' [[Col de la Croix de Fer]] and Col du Galibier, and ending with a summit finish at Les Deux Alpes.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2017|p=164}} On the Croix de Fer, Massi bridged over to a breakaway group and scored maximum points for the mountains classification, a feat he repeated on the second climb of the day, the [[Col du T\u00e9l\u00e9graphe]]. By this point, the lead group contained only Massi, [[Christophe Rinero]] ({{ct|COF|1998|nolink=yes}}) and [[Marcos-Antonio Serrano]] ({{ct|KEL|1998|nolink=yes}}). Behind them in the group of the main favourites, the high climbing tempo put Jalabert into difficulty, which ultimately saw him drop far down the general classification by the end of the stage.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2017|p=165}} After the short descent of the T\u00e9l\u00e9graphe, the race reached the Galibier, where Riis cracked following his work reeling back attackers, leaving Ullrich without a teammate.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2017|p=166}} With {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} remaining to the summit of the Galibier, Pantani made the decisive move of the race, attacking from the group of favourites.{{sfn|Edwards et al.|1998|p=141}} By the summit of the climb, Pantani had passed all the breakaway riders and was out in front alone, leading by ten seconds. Ullrich reached the top 2:41 minutes behind Pantani. Crucially, unlike Pantani, he did not wear a raincoat during the descent. He subsequently suffered from the cold and [[hyperglycemia]] for the rest of the stage.{{sfn|Rendell|2007|pages=124\u2013126}} The breakaway caught up to Pantani on the descent of the Galibier, forming a group of strong climbers. Before the final climb to Les Deux Alpes, Ullrich had a tyre puncture and was distanced by the group of chasers. On the climb, Pantani soon moved clear of his group and took the stage victory, almost two minutes ahead of Massi in second place. Ullrich finished with teammates [[Udo B\u00f6lts]] and Riis 8:57 minutes after Pantani, who took over the yellow jersey. He led Julich by 3:53 minutes, with Escart\u00edn in third place in the general classification, ahead of Ullrich.{{sfn|Edwards et al.|1998|pp=142\u2013146}}\n\nBefore the following stage to [[Albertville]], speculation spread that Ullrich would abandon the race.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2017|p=187}} Pantani's Mercatone Uno team coped well in defending his yellow over the four lesser categorised climbs, until the race reached the ''hors categorie'' final climb, the [[Col de la Madeleine]], when Ullrich attacked, with only Pantani able to follow. Ullrich led the duo up the rest of the climb as they passed the breakaway riders and increased their advantage over the chasing Julich, who was accompanied by two teammates. The pair held their lead of around two minutes along the final {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on}} of flat, where at the finish, Ullrich outsprinted Pantani to the stage win. Pantani now led Julich by 5:42 minutes, with Ullrich third, just over six minutes behind.{{sfn|Edwards et al.|1998|pp=147\u2013152}}\n\nAnother police raid on the TVM team and news about alleged mistreatment of the Festina riders while in custody led to another riders' strike on stage 17. After a brief stop of two minutes at the start, the riders rode slowly to the first intermediate sprint of the day, where they climbed off their bikes and sat on the road. Jalabert climbed into his team car and retired from the race. Meanwhile, Jean-Marie Leblanc negotiated with the riders and collected guarantees from a civil servant from the [[Ministry of the Interior (France)|French Ministry of the Interior]], who was visiting the Tour as a guest, that police treatment of the riders would improve. Nevertheless, the entire ONCE team followed their leader Jalabert and abandoned. As the riders slowly got moving again, they ripped off their race numbers as a further sign of protest. Luc Leblanc retired later in the stage. At the feed zone, the Banesto squad joined their fellow Spanish-based ONCE team in quitting, as well as the Italian-based Riso Scotti team. The field reached the finishing town, [[Aix-les-Bains]], two hours behind schedule. The TVM team was allowed to cross the line first as a sign of solidarity; while the stage was annulled and no results counted. Overnight, two more Spanish-based teams, Kelme and Vitalicio Seguros, also decided not to carry on in the Tour. This caused the retirement of the fourth rider overall, Escart\u00edn of Kelme.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2017|pages=202\u2013223}}\n\n===Conclusion===\n[[File:Marco Pantani.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Portrait of Marco Pantani wearing a bandana and glasses on his head|[[Marco Pantani]] (''pictured in 1997'') was the overall winner of the Tour, completing the [[Giro-Tour double]], as he had also won the [[1998 Giro d'Italia|Giro d'Italia]] earlier in the season.]]\nBefore stage 18 into [[Neuch\u00e2tel]] in Switzerland, police held Massi, who was still the leader in the mountains classification, for questioning after [[corticoid]]s were allegedly found in his room during a search of the Casino team hotel.{{efn|Massi was later cleared of all charges.<ref>{{cite news |title='Festina Affair': A timeline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/988530.stm |accessdate=30 October 2019 |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=24 October 2000}}</ref>}} He was therefore unable to start the stage,<ref name=\"wp-troubled\">{{cite news |last1=Thomazeau |first1=Francois |title=Troubled Tour Resumes; Steels Wins 18th Stage |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/cycling/longterm/1998/tour/articles/tour31.htm |url-access=limited |accessdate=4 June 2019 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=30 July 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604145145/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/cycling/longterm/1998/tour/articles/tour31.htm|archive-date=4 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and the lead of the mountains classification was passed to the second placed rider, Rinero.<ref name=\"pcs-leaders\" /> Victory went to Steels, who outsprinted Zabel and O'Grady at the finish.<ref name=\"wp-troubled\"  /> The remaining five riders from TVM exited the race on Swiss soil before the start of the following day.

The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013453}} Jan Ullrich wore the yellow jersey in the prologue as the winner of the previous edition.{{sfn|Edwards et al.|1998|p=27}} Time bonuses were given during the first half of the Tour to the first three finishers on each stage, excluding mountain stages and time trials. The winner received a 20-second bonus, the second finisher 12 seconds and the third rider 8 seconds.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pages=128\u2013129}} During the first half of the race, intermediate sprints also had time bonuses, with bonuses of 6, 4, and 2 seconds given to the first three riders to cross the line.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|p=183}}\n\nAdditionally, there was a [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]], in which cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=453\u2013454}} In flat stages, the first 25 finishers received points, 35 for the stage winner down to 1 point for 25th place. In medium mountain stages, the top-20 finishers received points, with 25 points for the stage winner down to 1 point. In mountain stages, the first 15 finishers received points, with 20 points given to the stage winner. In time trials, 15 points were given to the winner, down to 1 point for the tenth-placed finisher.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|p=154}} Points could also be won during intermediate sprints along the race route, with 6, 4, and 2 points for the first three riders across the line respectively.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|p=182}} The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified by a green jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=453\u2013454}}\n\nThere was also a [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and ''hors cat\u00e9gorie'', with the more difficult climbs rated lower.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}} The first rider to cross the summit of an ''hors cat\u00e9gorie'' climb was given 40 points (down to 1 point for the 15th rider).

Second-, third- and fourth-category climbs gave 20, 10 and 5 points to the first rider respectively.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|p=164}} The cyclist with the most points led the classification, wearing a white jersey with red polka dots.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}}\n\nThe [[Young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]], which was not marked by a jersey, was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years were eligible.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=454\u2013455}} This meant that in order to compete in the classification, a rider had to be born after 1 January 1973. 34 out of the 189 starters were eligible.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pages=174\u2013175}} Jan Ullrich won the classification for the third time in a row.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|p=176}}\n\nFor the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]], the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered the most combative. The winner of the award wore a red number bib during the next stage, this feature was introduced for the first time in 1998. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points.

de France''' was the 85th edition of the [[Tour de France]], one of cycling's [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]] and generally considered to be the most famous bike race in the world.{{sfn|Hanold|2012|p=13}} The {{convert|3,875|km|mi|abbr=on}} race was composed of 21 stages and a prologue. It started on 11 July in [[Ireland]] before taking an anti-clockwise route through France to finish in [[Paris]] on 2 August. [[Marco Pantani]] of {{ct|UNO|1998}} won the overall [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], with {{ct|THR|1998}}'s [[Jan Ullrich]], the defending champion, and {{ct|COF|1998}} rider [[Bobby Julich]] finishing on the podium in second and third respectively.\n\nThe general classification leader's yellow jersey was first awarded to [[Chris Boardman]] of the {{ct|GAN|1998a}} team, who won the prologue in Dublin. Following a crash by Boardman on stage 2 that caused his withdrawal, Ullrich's [[Sprinter (cycling)|sprinter]] teammate [[Erik Zabel]] took the race lead. He lost it the next stage to {{ct|ALM|1998}}'s [[Bo Hamburger]], who took it after being in a [[Breakaway (cycling)|breakaway]]. The day after, the yellow jersey switched to another rider from the same breakaway, Boardman's teammate [[Stuart O'Grady]], who took vital seconds from time bonuses gained in [[intermediate sprint]]s. He held it for a further three stages, until pre-race favourite Ullrich won stage 7's individual time trial, moving him into the overall lead. The next day, [[Laurent Desbiens]] of {{ct|COF|1998}} finished in a breakaway with a large enough margin to put him in the yellow jersey. Ullrich regained the race lead two stages later as the Tour went into the Pyrenees. Following his poor showing in the opening week, Pantani placed second and first, respectively, on the two Pyreneean stages. He then won the first stage in the Alps, stage 15, to replace Ullrich in the yellow jersey, which he maintained until the race's conclusion.\n\nZabel won his third consecutive Tour [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]] and Julich's teammate [[Christophe Rinero]], fourth overall, was the winner of the [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. Ullrich was the [[young rider classification in the Tour de France|best young rider]] and the [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|most combative]] was {{ct|CSO|1998}}'s [[Jacky Durand]]. The [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]] was won by {{ct|COF|1998|nolink=yes}}. [[Tom Steels]] of {{ct|MAP|1998}} won the most stages, with four.\n\nThe race was marred throughout its run by a doping scandal, commonly known as the [[Festina affair]]. Before the Tour began, [[Willy Voet]], ''[[soigneur]]'' of the [[Festina (cycling team)|Festina team]], was arrested at the Franco-Belgian border when doping products were found in his car. The affair broadened and the team was expelled after top personnel admitted to widespread doping. Police raids on numerous teams during the course of the race led to two riders' strikes and the withdrawal of several teams and riders. Due to the controversy, the race became known by the nickname \"'''Tour de Farce'''\". In July 2013, retrospective tests for [[recombinant EPO]] made in 2004 were made public, revealing that 44 out of 60 of samples returned positive tests.\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 1998 Tour de France}}\n\n[[File:Dubl\u00edn - Trinity College - 20170826172210.jpg|thumb|alt=A gated large stone building with a clock tower on its roof|[[Trinity College Dublin]] in Ireland hosted the team presentation ceremony on 10 July.]]\nThe organisers of the Tour, [[Amaury Sport Organisation]] (ASO), decided to reduce the number of [[Cycling team|teams]] from 22 to 21 for the 1998 Tour.

By this point, the lead group contained only Massi, [[Christophe Rinero]] ({{ct|COF|1998|nolink=yes}}) and [[Marcos-Antonio Serrano]] ({{ct|KEL|1998|nolink=yes}}). Behind them in the group of the main favourites, the high climbing tempo put Jalabert into difficulty, which ultimately saw him drop far down the general classification by the end of the stage.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2017|p=165}} After the short descent of the T\u00e9l\u00e9graphe, the race reached the Galibier, where Riis cracked following his work reeling back attackers, leaving Ullrich without a teammate.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2017|p=166}} With {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} remaining to the summit of the Galibier, Pantani made the decisive move of the race, attacking from the group of favourites.{{sfn|Edwards et al.|1998|p=141}} By the summit of the climb, Pantani had passed all the breakaway riders and was out in front alone, leading by ten seconds. Ullrich reached the top 2:41 minutes behind Pantani. Crucially, unlike Pantani, he did not wear a raincoat during the descent. He subsequently suffered from the cold and [[hyperglycemia]] for the rest of the stage.{{sfn|Rendell|2007|pages=124\u2013126}} The breakaway caught up to Pantani on the descent of the Galibier, forming a group of strong climbers. Before the final climb to Les Deux Alpes, Ullrich had a tyre puncture and was distanced by the group of chasers. On the climb, Pantani soon moved clear of his group and took the stage victory, almost two minutes ahead of Massi in second place. Ullrich finished with teammates [[Udo B\u00f6lts]] and Riis 8:57 minutes after Pantani, who took over the yellow jersey. He led Julich by 3:53 minutes, with Escart\u00edn in third place in the general classification, ahead of Ullrich.{{sfn|Edwards et al.|1998|pp=142\u2013146}}\n\nBefore the following stage to [[Albertville]], speculation spread that Ullrich would abandon the race.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2017|p=187}} Pantani's Mercatone Uno team coped well in defending his yellow over the four lesser categorised climbs, until the race reached the ''hors categorie'' final climb, the [[Col de la Madeleine]], when Ullrich attacked, with only Pantani able to follow. Ullrich led the duo up the rest of the climb as they passed the breakaway riders and increased their advantage over the chasing Julich, who was accompanied by two teammates. The pair held their lead of around two minutes along the final {{convert|17|km|mi|abbr=on}} of flat, where at the finish, Ullrich outsprinted Pantani to the stage win. Pantani now led Julich by 5:42 minutes, with Ullrich third, just over six minutes behind.{{sfn|Edwards et al.|1998|pp=147\u2013152}}\n\nAnother police raid on the TVM team and news about alleged mistreatment of the Festina riders while in custody led to another riders' strike on stage 17. After a brief stop of two minutes at the start, the riders rode slowly to the first intermediate sprint of the day, where they climbed off their bikes and sat on the road. Jalabert climbed into his team car and retired from the race. Meanwhile, Jean-Marie Leblanc negotiated with the riders and collected guarantees from a civil servant from the [[Ministry of the Interior (France)|French Ministry of the Interior]], who was visiting the Tour as a guest, that police treatment of the riders would improve. Nevertheless, the entire ONCE team followed their leader Jalabert and abandoned. As the riders slowly got moving again, they ripped off their race numbers as a further sign of protest. Luc Leblanc retired later in the stage. At the feed zone, the Banesto squad joined their fellow Spanish-based ONCE team in quitting, as well as the Italian-based Riso Scotti team. The field reached the finishing town, [[Aix-les-Bains]], two hours behind schedule. The TVM team was allowed to cross the line first as a sign of solidarity; while the stage was annulled and no results counted. Overnight, two more Spanish-based teams, Kelme and Vitalicio Seguros, also decided not to carry on in the Tour. This caused the retirement of the fourth rider overall, Escart\u00edn of Kelme.{{sfn|Fotheringham|2017|pages=202\u2013223}}\n\n===Conclusion===\n[[File:Marco Pantani.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Portrait of Marco Pantani wearing a bandana and glasses on his head|[[Marco Pantani]] (''pictured in 1997'') was the overall winner of the Tour, completing the [[Giro-Tour double]], as he had also won the [[1998 Giro d'Italia|Giro d'Italia]] earlier in the season.]]\nBefore stage 18 into [[Neuch\u00e2tel]] in Switzerland, police held Massi, who was still the leader in the mountains classification, for questioning after [[corticoid]]s were allegedly found in his room during a search of the Casino team hotel.{{efn|Massi was later cleared of all charges.<ref>{{cite news |title='Festina Affair': A timeline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/988530.stm |accessdate=30 October 2019 |work=[[BBC Sport]] |date=24 October 2000}}</ref>}} He was therefore unable to start the stage,<ref name=\"wp-troubled\">{{cite news |last1=Thomazeau |first1=Francois |title=Troubled Tour Resumes; Steels Wins 18th Stage |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/cycling/longterm/1998/tour/articles/tour31.htm |url-access=limited |accessdate=4 June 2019 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=30 July 1998|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604145145/https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/cycling/longterm/1998/tour/articles/tour31.htm|archive-date=4 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> and the lead of the mountains classification was passed to the second placed rider, Rinero.<ref name=\"pcs-leaders\" /> Victory went to Steels, who outsprinted Zabel and O'Grady at the finish.<ref name=\"wp-troubled\"  /> The remaining five riders from TVM exited the race on Swiss soil before the start of the following day.

The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013453}} Jan Ullrich wore the yellow jersey in the prologue as the winner of the previous edition.{{sfn|Edwards et al.|1998|p=27}} Time bonuses were given during the first half of the Tour to the first three finishers on each stage, excluding mountain stages and time trials. The winner received a 20-second bonus, the second finisher 12 seconds and the third rider 8 seconds.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pages=128\u2013129}} During the first half of the race, intermediate sprints also had time bonuses, with bonuses of 6, 4, and 2 seconds given to the first three riders to cross the line.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|p=183}}\n\nAdditionally, there was a [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]], in which cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=453\u2013454}} In flat stages, the first 25 finishers received points, 35 for the stage winner down to 1 point for 25th place. In medium mountain stages, the top-20 finishers received points, with 25 points for the stage winner down to 1 point. In mountain stages, the first 15 finishers received points, with 20 points given to the stage winner. In time trials, 15 points were given to the winner, down to 1 point for the tenth-placed finisher.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|p=154}} Points could also be won during intermediate sprints along the race route, with 6, 4, and 2 points for the first three riders across the line respectively.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|p=182}} The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified by a green jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=453\u2013454}}\n\nThere was also a [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and ''hors cat\u00e9gorie'', with the more difficult climbs rated lower.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}} The first rider to cross the summit of an ''hors cat\u00e9gorie'' climb was given 40 points (down to 1 point for the 15th rider). Twelve riders received points for first category climbs, with 30 for the first rider to reach the summit. Second-, third- and fourth-category climbs gave 20, 10 and 5 points to the first rider respectively.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|p=164}} The cyclist with the most points led the classification, wearing a white jersey with red polka dots.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}}\n\nThe [[Young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]], which was not marked by a jersey, was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years were eligible.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=454\u2013455}} This meant that in order to compete in the classification, a rider had to be born after 1 January 1973. 34 out of the 189 starters were eligible.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pages=174\u2013175}} Jan Ullrich won the classification for the third time in a row.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|p=176}}\n\nFor the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]], the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered the most combative. The winner of the award wore a red number bib during the next stage, this feature was introduced for the first time in 1998. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pp=211\u2013216}}{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}} Jacky Durand won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=89}} The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] was given in honour of Tour founder [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 15.

Adjoining the north-west shore of [[Lough Neagh]], the county covers an area of 2,074&nbsp;km\u00b2 (801 sq mi) and today has a population of about 247,132.\n\nSince 1972, the counties in Northern Ireland, including Londonderry, have no longer been used by the state as part of the local administration. Following further reforms in 2015, the area is now governed under three different districts; [[Derry and Strabane]], [[Causeway Coast and Glens]] and [[Mid-Ulster District|Mid-Ulster]]. Despite no longer being used for local government and administrative purposes, it is sometimes used in a cultural context in [[All-Ireland]] sporting and cultural events (i.e. [[Derry GAA]]).\n\nSince 1981, it has become one of four counties in Northern Ireland that has a [[Irish Catholic|Catholic]] majority (55.56% according to the 2001 Census<ref name=\"NISRA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/Census/pdf/Key%20Statistics%20ReportTables.pdf|title=NISRA - Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (c) 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127021255/http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/Census/pdf/Key%20Statistics%20ReportTables.pdf|archivedate=27 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>), with 57% of the Catholic population residing within [[Derry City Council]].<ref name=\"NISRA\"/> The [[county flower]] is the [[Purple Saxifrage]].<ref>[http://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/plantlife-discovering-plants-county-flowers.html County flowers in Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214131539/http://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/plantlife-discovering-plants-county-flowers.html |date=14 February 2006 }} www.plantlife.org.uk</ref>\n\n== Name ==\nThe place name ''Derry'' is an [[anglicisation]] of the old Irish ''Daire''<ref>{{cite book|last=Delanoy|first=Werner|title=Towards a Dialogic Anglistics|publisher=LIT Verlag|year=2007|page=38|isbn=978-3-8258-0549-4|display-authors=etal}}</ref> (Modern Irish ''Doire''<ref name=tearma>{{cite web | url = http://www.tearma.ie/Search.aspx?term=doire | title = doire | work = t\u00e9arma.ie \u2013 Dictionary of Irish Terms | publisher = [[Foras na Gaeilge]] and [[Dublin City University]] | accessdate = 18 November 2016}}</ref>), meaning \"oak-grove\" or \"oak-wood\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Blackie|first=Christina|title=Geographical Etymology|publisher=Marton Press|year=2010|page=61|isbn=978-1-4455-8286-3}}</ref>\n\nAs with the city, its name is subject to the [[Derry/Londonderry name dispute]], with the form \"Londonderry\" generally preferred by [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] and \"Derry\" by [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]].

Sawel is part of the [[Sperrin Mountains]], which dominate the southern part of the county. To the east and west, the land falls into the valleys of the [[River Bann|Bann]] and [[River Foyle|Foyle]] rivers respectively; in the south-east, the county touches the shore of Lough Neagh, which is the largest lake in Ireland; the north of the county is distinguished by the steep cliffs, dune systems, and remarkable beaches of the Atlantic coast.\n\nThe county is home to a number of important buildings and landscapes, including the well-preserved 17th-century [[city wall]]s of [[Derry]]; the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]\u2013owned [[Plantation of Ulster|Plantation]] [[Springhill House|estate at Springhill]]; [[Mussenden Temple]] on the Atlantic coast; the [[Dike (construction)|dikes]], artificial coastlines and the [[Bird sanctuary|bird sanctuaries]] on the eastern shore of [[Lough Foyle]]; and the visitor centre at [[Bellaghy]] Bawn, close to the childhood home of Nobel laureate [[Seamus Heaney]].

These councils were: [[Derry City Council|Londonderry City Council]] (renamed Derry City Council in 1984), [[Limavady Borough Council]], and [[Magherafelt District Council]], most of [[Coleraine Borough Council]], and part of [[Cookstown District Council]]. After a reduction in the number of councils in Northern Ireland in 2011, County Londonderry is divided into three cross-county councils: [[Causeway Coast and Glens]], [[Derry and Strabane]], and [[Mid-Ulster District]].\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Downhill Railway Runnel - geograph.org.uk - 1197950.jpg|thumb|Downhill Tunnels near [[Castlerock railway station]].]]\n\n[[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink]] provides a [[Northern Ireland Railways]] service in the county, linking [[Londonderry Waterside railway station]] to [[Coleraine railway station]] (with a branch to {{stnlnk|Portrush}} on the [[Coleraine\u2013Portrush railway line]]) and onwards into County Antrim to [[Belfast Central railway station|Belfast Central]] and [[Belfast Great Victoria Street railway station|Belfast Great Victoria Street]] on the [[Belfast-Derry railway line]].\n\nThere is also the [[Foyle Valley Railway]], a museum in [[Derry]] with some rolling stock from both the [[County Donegal Railway]] and the [[Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway]], and is located on the site of the former [[Londonderry Foyle Road railway station]]. The [[Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway]] continued as a private bus company based in the city but operating predominantly in [[County Donegal]] until it closed in 2014. Bus services are now provided by [[Ulsterbus]].\n\n== Education ==\nGovernment-funded education up to secondary school level is administered by the [[Education Authority]] (EA), sponsored by the [[Department of Education (Northern Ireland)|Department of Education]]. The EA is divided into sub-regions:\n\n* Western region: Derry, Limavady;\n* North Eastern region: Coleraine, Magherafelt;\n* Southern region: Cookstown.\n\nFor Catholic grant-maintained schools administration is by the Derry Diocesan Education Office.\n\nTwo major centres of the [[University of Ulster]] are in the county, including its headquarters at [[University of Ulster at Coleraine|Coleraine]] and the [[Magee College|Magee Campus]] in Derry.\n\n== Sport ==\n[[File:Tammet\u00f5ru.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The oak leaf which represents the county's [[List of Irish county nicknames|nickname]].]]\nIn [[Gaelic Athletic Association|Gaelic games]], the [[GAA county]] of [[Derry GAA|Derry]] is more or less coterminous with the former administrative county of Londonderry, although teams from the neighbouring counties of Tyrone, Donegal and Antrim have occasionally played in Derry competitions, and vice versa. The Derry teams wear the colours red and white. There are many club teams competing in up to five leagues and three championships. The county team has won one [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] (in [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship 1993|1993]]) and five [[National Football League (Ireland)|National League titles]]. [[Hurling]] is also widely played but is not as popular as football.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} However, the county team is generally regarded as one of the top hurling sides in [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship|Ulster]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} and in [[Nicky Rackard Cup 2006|2006]] won the [[Nicky Rackard Cup]] \u2013 the third tier hurling competition in Ireland.\n\nIn association football, the [[NIFL Premiership]], which operates as the top division, has two teams in the county: [[Coleraine F.C.]] and [[Institute F.C.]], with [[Limavady United F.C.]], [[Moyola Park F.C.]], [[Portstewart F.C.]] and [[Tobermore United F.C.]] competing in the [[NIFL Championship]], which operates as levels two and three.

Prior to the [[partition of Ireland]], it was one of the [[counties of Ireland|counties]] of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] from 1613 onward and then of the [[United Kingdom]] after the [[Acts of Union 1800]]. Adjoining the north-west shore of [[Lough Neagh]], the county covers an area of 2,074&nbsp;km\u00b2 (801 sq mi) and today has a population of about 247,132.\n\nSince 1972, the counties in Northern Ireland, including Londonderry, have no longer been used by the state as part of the local administration. Following further reforms in 2015, the area is now governed under three different districts; [[Derry and Strabane]], [[Causeway Coast and Glens]] and [[Mid-Ulster District|Mid-Ulster]]. Despite no longer being used for local government and administrative purposes, it is sometimes used in a cultural context in [[All-Ireland]] sporting and cultural events (i.e. [[Derry GAA]]).\n\nSince 1981, it has become one of four counties in Northern Ireland that has a [[Irish Catholic|Catholic]] majority (55.56% according to the 2001 Census<ref name=\"NISRA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/Census/pdf/Key%20Statistics%20ReportTables.pdf|title=NISRA - Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (c) 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127021255/http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/Census/pdf/Key%20Statistics%20ReportTables.pdf|archivedate=27 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>), with 57% of the Catholic population residing within [[Derry City Council]].<ref name=\"NISRA\"/> The [[county flower]] is the [[Purple Saxifrage]].<ref>[http://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/plantlife-discovering-plants-county-flowers.html County flowers in Britain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214131539/http://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/plantlife-discovering-plants-county-flowers.html |date=14 February 2006 }} www.plantlife.org.uk</ref>\n\n== Name ==\nThe place name ''Derry'' is an [[anglicisation]] of the old Irish ''Daire''<ref>{{cite book|last=Delanoy|first=Werner|title=Towards a Dialogic Anglistics|publisher=LIT Verlag|year=2007|page=38|isbn=978-3-8258-0549-4|display-authors=etal}}</ref> (Modern Irish ''Doire''<ref name=tearma>{{cite web | url = http://www.tearma.ie/Search.aspx?term=doire | title = doire | work = t\u00e9arma.ie \u2013 Dictionary of Irish Terms | publisher = [[Foras na Gaeilge]] and [[Dublin City University]] | accessdate = 18 November 2016}}</ref>), meaning \"oak-grove\" or \"oak-wood\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Blackie|first=Christina|title=Geographical Etymology|publisher=Marton Press|year=2010|page=61|isbn=978-1-4455-8286-3}}</ref>\n\nAs with the city, its name is subject to the [[Derry/Londonderry name dispute]], with the form \"Londonderry\" generally preferred by [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] and \"Derry\" by [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceps.eu/Article.php?article_id=206|title=Centre for European Policy Studies, accessed 6 October 2007|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"Maiden\">{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1588|title=The Walled City Experience|publisher=Northern Ireland Tourist Board|accessdate=4 September 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420182750/http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1588|archivedate=20 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4887352.stm BBC News: Court to Rule on City Name] 7 April 2006</ref><ref>''City name row lands in High Court'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6213890.stm BBC News]</ref><ref>{{cite BAILII |litigants=Derry City Council: Re Application for Judicial Review |link= |country=nie |court=NIHC |division=QB |year=2007 |num=5 |para= |eucase= |parallelcite= |date= |courtname= |juris= }}</ref> British authorities use the name \"Londonderry\", while \"Derry\" is used by the [[Republic of Ireland]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cannon on Derry City Walls SMC 2007.jpg|220px|thumbnail|A cannon sits atop the historic Derry Walls, which look over [[Derry|Derry City]].]]\n[[File:1837Londonderry.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Map of County Londonderry, 1837]]\n\n===Pre-historic===\n[[Mount Sandel Mesolithic site|Mountsandel]] located near Coleraine in County Londonderry is \"perhaps the oldest recorded settlement within Ireland\".<ref>A.E.P.

These councils were: [[Derry City Council|Londonderry City Council]] (renamed Derry City Council in 1984), [[Limavady Borough Council]], and [[Magherafelt District Council]], most of [[Coleraine Borough Council]], and part of [[Cookstown District Council]]. After a reduction in the number of councils in Northern Ireland in 2011, County Londonderry is divided into three cross-county councils: [[Causeway Coast and Glens]], [[Derry and Strabane]], and [[Mid-Ulster District]].\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Downhill Railway Runnel - geograph.org.uk - 1197950.jpg|thumb|Downhill Tunnels near [[Castlerock railway station]].]]\n\n[[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink]] provides a [[Northern Ireland Railways]] service in the county, linking [[Londonderry Waterside railway station]] to [[Coleraine railway station]] (with a branch to {{stnlnk|Portrush}} on the [[Coleraine\u2013Portrush railway line]]) and onwards into County Antrim to [[Belfast Central railway station|Belfast Central]] and [[Belfast Great Victoria Street railway station|Belfast Great Victoria Street]] on the [[Belfast-Derry railway line]].\n\nThere is also the [[Foyle Valley Railway]], a museum in [[Derry]] with some rolling stock from both the [[County Donegal Railway]] and the [[Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway]], and is located on the site of the former [[Londonderry Foyle Road railway station]]. The [[Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway]] continued as a private bus company based in the city but operating predominantly in [[County Donegal]] until it closed in 2014. Bus services are now provided by [[Ulsterbus]].\n\n== Education ==\nGovernment-funded education up to secondary school level is administered by the [[Education Authority]] (EA), sponsored by the [[Department of Education (Northern Ireland)|Department of Education]]. The EA is divided into sub-regions:\n\n* Western region: Derry, Limavady;\n* North Eastern region: Coleraine, Magherafelt;\n* Southern region: Cookstown.\n\nFor Catholic grant-maintained schools administration is by the Derry Diocesan Education Office.\n\nTwo major centres of the [[University of Ulster]] are in the county, including its headquarters at [[University of Ulster at Coleraine|Coleraine]] and the [[Magee College|Magee Campus]] in Derry.\n\n== Sport ==\n[[File:Tammet\u00f5ru.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The oak leaf which represents the county's [[List of Irish county nicknames|nickname]].]]\nIn [[Gaelic Athletic Association|Gaelic games]], the [[GAA county]] of [[Derry GAA|Derry]] is more or less coterminous with the former administrative county of Londonderry, although teams from the neighbouring counties of Tyrone, Donegal and Antrim have occasionally played in Derry competitions, and vice versa. The Derry teams wear the colours red and white. There are many club teams competing in up to five leagues and three championships. The county team has won one [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] (in [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship 1993|1993]]) and five [[National Football League (Ireland)|National League titles]].
