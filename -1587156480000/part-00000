The park was formerly a prison yard, back when the country was still under colonial rule and it was known then as Her Majesty's Broad Street Prisons. Freedom park was created to serve as a national memorial in remembrance of the nation's founding fathers who struggled against colonial rule and fought for the country's independence. The park was opened in 2010 to celebrate Nigeria's 50th independence celebration. The park is now a tourist attraction to both locals and foreigners and you can actually find historical statues all over the park. There is also an amphi-theatre which holds concerts, music shows and drama presentations. You can also relax by the numerous ponds and fountains at the park or visit the Wole Soyinka Art Gallery to view unique art presentations.<ref>https://www.freedomparklagos.com/</ref>\n\n===Marina road===\nThe Lagos Marina host a number of office buildings, Bookshop House, formerly CMS and the [[Cathedral Church of Christ, Lagos|Cathedral Church of Christ]]. Due to the conditions of the soil, the foundations of most of the tall buildings are either piled or raft. Buildings along the marina include National House, occupied by Shell, this was the first tall office building at Marina. Former Central Bank headquarters and Investment House, headquarters of [[The Bank of Industry|Bank of Industry]] were built-in 1960. The Investment House land previously housed the Grand Hotel before it was demolished. New Africa House of UAC, [[Elder Dempster Lines|Elder Dempster]] House, [[Nigerian Ports Authority]] head office and [[National Electric Power Authority]]'s former headquarters are located along the marina.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Building Lagos |last=Akinsemoyin |first=\u02bcKunle |date=1977 |publisher=F. & A.

''Weasel coffee'' is a loose English translation of its [[Vietnam]]ese name ''c\u00e0 ph\u00ea Ch\u1ed3n''.\n\nProducers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms, selection \u2013 civets choosing to eat only certain cherries \u2013 and digestion \u2013 biological or chemical mechanisms in the animal's digestive tract altering the composition of the coffee cherries.\n\nThe traditional method of collecting feces from wild Asian palm civets has given way to an [[intensive farming]] method, in which the palm civets are kept in [[battery cage]]s and are force-fed the cherries. This method of production has raised ethical concerns about the treatment of civets and the conditions they are made to live in, which include isolation, poor diet, small cages and a high mortality rate.<ref name=\"Milman\">{{cite news |author=Milman, O. |title=World's most expensive coffee tainted by 'horrific' civet abuse |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/19/civet-coffee-abuse-campaigners |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2012 | accessdate = 25 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Penha |first=J. |date=2012 |title=Excreted by imprisoned civets, kopi luwak no longer a personal favorite |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/talkback/excreted-by-imprisoned-civets-kopi-luwak-no-longer-a-personal-favorite/535098 |newspaper=The Jakarta Globe |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC20130913\">{{cite news |first=G. |last=Lynn |first2=C. |last2=Rogers |title=Civet cat coffee's animal cruelty secrets |date=2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-24034029 |newspaper=BBC News |accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlthough kopi luwak is a form of processing rather than a variety of coffee, it has been called one of the most expensive coffees in the world, with retail prices reaching {{\u20ac|550}} / {{US$|700}} per kilogram.<ref>{{cite news |first=H.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons of the show are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

Television producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a small [[Los Angeles]] Thai restaurant in October 2017. While waiting for dinner, he observed the other patrons staring at a television while an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (season 3)|third season]] of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing. Intrigued, Plestis began to research the series and secured the rights to produce an American adaptation within one week in a deal brokered by Steve Wohl of [[Paradigm Talent Agency]]. Plestis then called Fox executive Rob Wade on a Friday night to schedule a meeting with him the following Monday and worked to create a showcase during the weekend.

Regarding the panelists, she said the production team was less concerned with selecting those with an ability to critique participants' singing abilities than being able to create a comedic tone for the show as one of their goals was to reassure celebrities they would not be ridiculed for choosing to appear. Jeong was the first panelist to be signed on to the series due to his humour and pre-existing knowledge of the South Korean version, followed by McCarthy Wahlberg, Thicke, and Scherzinger.<ref name=\"E!

She said many of the celebrities had emotional reactions when presented with the proposed costumes and that they were excited about using the show as a way of reinventing their [[reputation|public image]].

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performances and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first version of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. They have received mixed reviews from critics, as have the series' format and production value. However, the costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team of two dozen people who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions into each costume that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons of the show are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

Television producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a small [[Los Angeles]] Thai restaurant in October 2017. While waiting for dinner, he observed the other patrons staring at a television while an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (season 3)|third season]] of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing. Intrigued, Plestis began to research the series and secured the rights to produce an American adaptation within one week in a deal brokered by Steve Wohl of [[Paradigm Talent Agency]]. Plestis then called Fox executive Rob Wade on a Friday night to schedule a meeting with him the following Monday and worked to create a showcase during the weekend.

Regarding the panelists, she said the production team was less concerned with selecting those with an ability to critique participants' singing abilities than being able to create a comedic tone for the show as one of their goals was to reassure celebrities they would not be ridiculed for choosing to appear.

The yearning to be understood, to find opportunities to share experiences, to not be left alone with one's bizarre interest. At the same time one derives an almost perverse pleasure from wallowing in this deficit. Nerds love deficiency: that of the other, but also their own.
