Twenty of these modules were accumulators that could not only add and subtract, but hold a ten-digit [[decimal]] number in memory. Numbers were passed between these units across several general-purpose [[Bus (computing)|buses]] (or ''trays'', as they were called). In order to achieve its high speed, the panels had to send and receive numbers, compute, save the answer and trigger the next operation, all without any moving parts. Key to its versatility was the ability to ''branch''; it could trigger different operations, depending on the sign of a computed result.\n\n===Components===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}<!--only first paragraph has citations-->\nBy the end of its operation in 1956, ENIAC contained 20,000 [[vacuum tube]]s; 7,200 [[crystal diode]]s; 1,500 [[relay]]s; 70,000 [[resistor]]s; 10,000 [[capacitor]]s; and approximately 5,000,000 hand-[[solder]]ed joints.

These cards could be used to produce printed output offline using an [[IBM]] accounting machine, such as the [[IBM 405]]. While ENIAC had no system to store memory in its inception, these punch cards could be used for external memory storage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seas.upenn.edu/about-seas/eniac/operation.php |title=ENIAC in Action: What it Was and How it Worked |website=ENIAC: Celebrating Penn Engineering History |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref> In 1953, a 100-[[Word (computer architecture)|word]] [[magnetic-core memory]] built by the Burroughs Corporation was added to ENIAC.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2001/cmsc411/projects/ramguide/pastandfuture/pastandfuture.html |title=Past and Future Developments in Memory Design |author-last=Martin |author-first=Jason |date=1998-12-17 |website=Past and Future Developments in Memory Design |publisher=University of Maryland |access-date=2016-05-17}}</ref>\n\nENIAC used [[Serial decimal|ten-position]] [[ring counter]]s to store digits; each digit required 36 vacuum tubes, 10 of which were the dual triodes making up the [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]] of the ring counter. Arithmetic was performed by \"counting\" pulses with the ring counters and generating carry pulses if the counter \"wrapped around\", the idea being to electronically emulate the operation of the digit wheels of a mechanical [[adding machine]].\n\nENIAC had 20 ten-digit signed [[accumulator (computing)|accumulators]], which used [[ten's complement]] representation and could perform 5,000 simple addition or subtraction operations between any of them and a source (e.g., another accumulator or a constant transmitter) per second. It was possible to connect several accumulators to run simultaneously, so the peak speed of operation was potentially much higher, due to parallel operation.\n\n[[Image:Classic shot of the ENIAC.jpg|thumb|250px|Cpl.

ENIAC used four of the accumulators (controlled by a special multiplier unit) to perform up to 385 multiplication operations per second; five of the accumulators were controlled by a special divider/square-rooter unit to perform up to 40 division operations per second or three [[square root]] operations per second.\n\nThe other nine units in ENIAC were the initiating unit (started and stopped the machine), the cycling unit (used for synchronizing the other units), the master programmer (controlled loop sequencing), the reader (controlled an IBM punch-card reader), the printer (controlled an IBM card punch), the constant transmitter, and three function tables.{{sfn|Clippinger|1948|loc=Section I: General Description of the ENIAC \u2013 The Function Tables}}{{sfn|Goldstine|1946}}\n\n===Operation times===\nThe references by Rojas and Hashagen (or Wilkes)<ref name=\"Wilkes\"/> give more details about the times for operations, which differ somewhat from those stated above.\n\nThe basic machine cycle was 200 [[microsecond]]s (20 cycles of the 100&nbsp;kHz clock in the cycling unit), or 5,000 cycles per second for operations on the 10-digit numbers. In one of these cycles, ENIAC could write a number to a register, read a number from a register, or add/subtract two numbers.\n\nA multiplication of a 10-digit number by a ''d''-digit number (for ''d'' up to 10) took ''d''+4 cycles, so a 10- by 10-digit multiplication took 14 cycles, or 2,800 microseconds\u2014a rate of 357 per second. If one of the numbers had fewer than 10 digits, the operation was faster.\n\nDivision and square roots took 13(''d''+1) cycles, where ''d'' is the number of digits in the result (quotient or square root). So a division or square root took up to 143 cycles, or 28,600 microseconds\u2014a rate of 35 per second. (Wilkes 1956:20<ref name=\"Wilkes\"/> states that a division with a 10 digit quotient required 6 milliseconds.) If the result had fewer than ten digits, it was obtained faster.\n\n===Reliability===\nENIAC used common [[Octal tube|octal-base]] [[radio tube]]s of the day; the decimal [[accumulator (computing)|accumulators]] were made of [[6SN7]] [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]], while 6L7s, 6SJ7s, 6SA7s and 6AC7s were used in logic functions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Burks|1947|pp=756\u2013767}}</ref> Numerous [[6L6]]s and [[6V6]]s served as line drivers to drive pulses through cables between rack assemblies.\n\nSeveral tubes burned out almost every day, leaving ENIAC nonfunctional about half the time. Special high-reliability tubes were not available until 1948. Most of these failures, however, occurred during the warm-up and cool-down periods, when the tube heaters and cathodes were under the most thermal stress. Engineers reduced ENIAC's tube failures to the more acceptable rate of one tube every two days. According to an interview in 1989 with Eckert, \"We had a tube fail about every two days and we could locate the problem within 15 minutes.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/108568/Q_A_A_lost_interview_with_ENIAC_co_inventor_J._Presper_Eckert |title=A lost interview with ENIAC co-inventor J.

Though contemporaries considered programming a clerical task and did not publicly recognize the programmers' effect on the successful operation and announcement of ENIAC,{{sfn|Light|1999}} McNulty, Jennings, Snyder, Wescoff, Bilas, and Lichterman have since been recognized for their contributions to computing.<ref name=\"invisible\"/><ref name=\"secret\"/><ref name=\"siff\"/>\n\nThe \"programmer\" and \"operator\" job titles were not originally considered professions suitable for women. The labor shortage created by World War II helped enable the entry of women into the field.{{sfn|Light|1999}} However, the field was not viewed as prestigious, and bringing in women was viewed as a way to free men up for more skilled labor. For example, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics said in 1942, \"It is felt that enough greater return is obtained by freeing the engineers from calculating detail to overcome any increased expenses in the computers' salaries.

The freeze on design in 1943 meant that the computer design would lack some innovations that soon became well-developed, notably the ability to store a program. Eckert and Mauchly started work on a new design, to be later called the [[EDVAC]], which would be both simpler and more powerful. In particular, in 1944 Eckert wrote his description of a memory unit (the mercury [[delay line memory|delay line]]) which would hold both the data and the program. John von Neumann, who was consulting for the Moore School on the EDVAC, sat in on the Moore School meetings at which the stored program concept was elaborated. Von Neumann wrote up an incomplete set of notes (''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'') which were intended to be used as an internal memorandum\u2014describing, elaborating, and couching in formal logical language the ideas developed in the meetings. ENIAC administrator and security officer [[Herman Goldstine]] distributed copies of this ''First Draft'' to a number of government and educational institutions, spurring widespread interest in the construction of a new generation of electronic computing machines, including [[Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator]] (EDSAC) at Cambridge University, England and [[SEAC (computer)|SEAC]] at the U.S. Bureau of Standards.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Improvements===\nA number of improvements were made to ENIAC after 1947, including a primitive read-only stored programming mechanism using the function tables as program [[Read-only memory|ROM]],<ref name=\":2\" />{{sfn|Goldstine|1947}}<ref>\n*{{harvnb|Goldstine|1972|p=|loc=233-234, 270; search string: ''eniac Adele 1947'' {{quote|By July 1947 von Neumann was writing: \"I am much obliged to Adele for her letters.

This modification reduced the speed of ENIAC by a factor of 6 and eliminated the ability of parallel computation, but as it also reduced the reprogramming time{{sfn|Goldstine|1972|p=|loc=233-234, 270; search string: ''eniac Adele 1947''}}<ref name=\":2\" /> to hours instead of days, it was considered well worth the loss of performance. Also analysis had shown that due to differences between the electronic speed of computation and the electromechanical speed of input/output, almost any real-world problem was completely [[I/O bound]], even without making use of the original machine's parallelism. Most computations would still be I/O bound, even after the speed reduction imposed by this modification.\n\nEarly in 1952, a high-speed shifter was added, which improved the speed for shifting by a factor of five. In July 1953, a 100-word expansion [[Magnetic-core memory|core memory]] was added to the system, using [[binary-coded decimal]], [[excess-3]] number representation. To support this expansion memory, ENIAC was equipped with a new Function Table selector, a memory address selector, pulse-shaping circuits, and three new orders were added to the programming mechanism.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web |url=http://epictechnologyforgreatjustice.weebly.com/eniac.html |title=Eniac |last= |first= |date= |website=Epic Technology for Great Justice |language=en |access-date=2017-01-28}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison with other early computers==\n{{main|History of computing hardware}}\n<!--THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT ENIAC.

Happy editing! -->\n\nMechanical computing machines have been around since [[Archimedes]]' time (see: [[Antikythera mechanism]]), but the 1930s and 1940s are considered the beginning of the modern computer era.\n\nENIAC was, like the IBM [[Harvard Mark I]] and the German [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]], able to run an arbitrary sequence of mathematical operations, but did not read them from a tape. Like the British [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], it was programmed by plugboard and switches. ENIAC combined full, [[Turing-complete]] programmability with electronic speed. The [[Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer]] (ABC), ENIAC, and Colossus all used [[vacuum tube|thermionic valves (vacuum tubes)]]. ENIAC's registers performed decimal arithmetic, rather than binary arithmetic like the Z3, the ABC and Colossus.\n\nLike the Colossus, ENIAC required rewiring to reprogram until April 1948.<ref>See [[#Improvements]]</ref> In June 1948, the [[Manchester Baby]] ran its first program and earned the distinction of first electronic [[stored-program computer]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Programming the ENIAC: an example of why computer history is hard {{!}} @CHM Blog {{!}} Computer History Museum |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/programming-the-eniac-an-example-of-why-computer-history-is-hard/ |website=www.computerhistory.org |language=en|date=2016-05-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Haigh|first=Thomas|last2=Priestley|first2=Mark|last3=Rope|first3=Crispin|date=January\u2013March 2014|title=Reconsidering the Stored Program Concept|url=http://eniacinaction.com/the-articles/1-reconsidering-the-stored-program-concept/|journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume=36|issue=1|pages=9\u201310|via=|doi=10.1109/mahc.2013.56}}</ref>{{sfn|Haigh|Priestley|Rope|2014|pp=48-54}} Though the idea of a stored-program computer with combined memory for program and data was conceived during the development of ENIAC, it was not initially implemented in ENIAC because World War II priorities required the machine to be completed quickly, and ENIAC's 20 storage locations would be too small to hold data and programs.\n\n===Public knowledge===\nThe Z3 and Colossus were developed independently of each other, and of the ABC and ENIAC during World War II. Work on the ABC at [[Iowa State University]] was stopped in 1942 after [[John Atanasoff]] was called to [[Washington, D.C.]], to do physics research for the U.S. Navy, and it was subsequently dismantled.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|p=106}} The Z3 was destroyed by the Allied bombing raids of Berlin in 1943. As the ten Colossus machines were part of the UK's war effort their existence remained secret until the late 1970s, although knowledge of their capabilities remained among their UK staff and invited Americans. ENIAC, by contrast, was put through its paces for the press in 1946, \"and captured the world's imagination\". Older histories of computing may therefore not be comprehensive in their coverage and analysis of this period. All but two of the Colossus machine were dismantled in 1945; the remaining two were used to decrypt Soviet messages by [[GCHQ]] until the 1960s.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|p=2}}<ref>{{Citation | last = Ward | first = Mark | title = How GCHQ built on a colossal secret | publisher = BBC News | date = 5 May 2014 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26714967 }}</ref> The public demonstration for ENIAC was developed by Snyder and Jennings who created a demo that would calculate the trajectory of a missile in 15 seconds, a task that would have taken several weeks for a [[human computer]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Patent===\n{{main|Honeywell v.

Twenty of these modules were accumulators that could not only add and subtract, but hold a ten-digit [[decimal]] number in memory. Numbers were passed between these units across several general-purpose [[Bus (computing)|buses]] (or ''trays'', as they were called). In order to achieve its high speed, the panels had to send and receive numbers, compute, save the answer and trigger the next operation, all without any moving parts. Key to its versatility was the ability to ''branch''; it could trigger different operations, depending on the sign of a computed result.\n\n===Components===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}<!--only first paragraph has citations-->\nBy the end of its operation in 1956, ENIAC contained 20,000 [[vacuum tube]]s; 7,200 [[crystal diode]]s; 1,500 [[relay]]s; 70,000 [[resistor]]s; 10,000 [[capacitor]]s; and approximately 5,000,000 hand-[[solder]]ed joints.

Arithmetic was performed by \"counting\" pulses with the ring counters and generating carry pulses if the counter \"wrapped around\", the idea being to electronically emulate the operation of the digit wheels of a mechanical [[adding machine]].\n\nENIAC had 20 ten-digit signed [[accumulator (computing)|accumulators]], which used [[ten's complement]] representation and could perform 5,000 simple addition or subtraction operations between any of them and a source (e.g., another accumulator or a constant transmitter) per second. It was possible to connect several accumulators to run simultaneously, so the peak speed of operation was potentially much higher, due to parallel operation.\n\n[[Image:Classic shot of the ENIAC.jpg|thumb|250px|Cpl.

ENIAC used four of the accumulators (controlled by a special multiplier unit) to perform up to 385 multiplication operations per second; five of the accumulators were controlled by a special divider/square-rooter unit to perform up to 40 division operations per second or three [[square root]] operations per second.\n\nThe other nine units in ENIAC were the initiating unit (started and stopped the machine), the cycling unit (used for synchronizing the other units), the master programmer (controlled loop sequencing), the reader (controlled an IBM punch-card reader), the printer (controlled an IBM card punch), the constant transmitter, and three function tables.{{sfn|Clippinger|1948|loc=Section I: General Description of the ENIAC \u2013 The Function Tables}}{{sfn|Goldstine|1946}}\n\n===Operation times===\nThe references by Rojas and Hashagen (or Wilkes)<ref name=\"Wilkes\"/> give more details about the times for operations, which differ somewhat from those stated above.\n\nThe basic machine cycle was 200 [[microsecond]]s (20 cycles of the 100&nbsp;kHz clock in the cycling unit), or 5,000 cycles per second for operations on the 10-digit numbers. In one of these cycles, ENIAC could write a number to a register, read a number from a register, or add/subtract two numbers.\n\nA multiplication of a 10-digit number by a ''d''-digit number (for ''d'' up to 10) took ''d''+4 cycles, so a 10- by 10-digit multiplication took 14 cycles, or 2,800 microseconds\u2014a rate of 357 per second. If one of the numbers had fewer than 10 digits, the operation was faster.\n\nDivision and square roots took 13(''d''+1) cycles, where ''d'' is the number of digits in the result (quotient or square root). So a division or square root took up to 143 cycles, or 28,600 microseconds\u2014a rate of 35 per second. (Wilkes 1956:20<ref name=\"Wilkes\"/> states that a division with a 10 digit quotient required 6 milliseconds.) If the result had fewer than ten digits, it was obtained faster.\n\n===Reliability===\nENIAC used common [[Octal tube|octal-base]] [[radio tube]]s of the day; the decimal [[accumulator (computing)|accumulators]] were made of [[6SN7]] [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]], while 6L7s, 6SJ7s, 6SA7s and 6AC7s were used in logic functions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Burks|1947|pp=756\u2013767}}</ref> Numerous [[6L6]]s and [[6V6]]s served as line drivers to drive pulses through cables between rack assemblies.\n\nSeveral tubes burned out almost every day, leaving ENIAC nonfunctional about half the time. Special high-reliability tubes were not available until 1948. Most of these failures, however, occurred during the warm-up and cool-down periods, when the tube heaters and cathodes were under the most thermal stress. Engineers reduced ENIAC's tube failures to the more acceptable rate of one tube every two days. According to an interview in 1989 with Eckert, \"We had a tube fail about every two days and we could locate the problem within 15 minutes.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/108568/Q_A_A_lost_interview_with_ENIAC_co_inventor_J._Presper_Eckert |title=A lost interview with ENIAC co-inventor J.

It was formally accepted by the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps in July 1946. ENIAC was shut down on November 9, 1946 for a refurbishment and a memory upgrade, and was transferred to [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], [[Maryland]] in 1947.

The freeze on design in 1943 meant that the computer design would lack some innovations that soon became well-developed, notably the ability to store a program. Eckert and Mauchly started work on a new design, to be later called the [[EDVAC]], which would be both simpler and more powerful. In particular, in 1944 Eckert wrote his description of a memory unit (the mercury [[delay line memory|delay line]]) which would hold both the data and the program. John von Neumann, who was consulting for the Moore School on the EDVAC, sat in on the Moore School meetings at which the stored program concept was elaborated. Von Neumann wrote up an incomplete set of notes (''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'') which were intended to be used as an internal memorandum\u2014describing, elaborating, and couching in formal logical language the ideas developed in the meetings. ENIAC administrator and security officer [[Herman Goldstine]] distributed copies of this ''First Draft'' to a number of government and educational institutions, spurring widespread interest in the construction of a new generation of electronic computing machines, including [[Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator]] (EDSAC) at Cambridge University, England and [[SEAC (computer)|SEAC]] at the U.S. Bureau of Standards.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Improvements===\nA number of improvements were made to ENIAC after 1947, including a primitive read-only stored programming mechanism using the function tables as program [[Read-only memory|ROM]],<ref name=\":2\" />{{sfn|Goldstine|1947}}<ref>\n*{{harvnb|Goldstine|1972|p=|loc=233-234, 270; search string: ''eniac Adele 1947'' {{quote|By July 1947 von Neumann was writing: \"I am much obliged to Adele for her letters.

This modification reduced the speed of ENIAC by a factor of 6 and eliminated the ability of parallel computation, but as it also reduced the reprogramming time{{sfn|Goldstine|1972|p=|loc=233-234, 270; search string: ''eniac Adele 1947''}}<ref name=\":2\" /> to hours instead of days, it was considered well worth the loss of performance. Also analysis had shown that due to differences between the electronic speed of computation and the electromechanical speed of input/output, almost any real-world problem was completely [[I/O bound]], even without making use of the original machine's parallelism. Most computations would still be I/O bound, even after the speed reduction imposed by this modification.\n\nEarly in 1952, a high-speed shifter was added, which improved the speed for shifting by a factor of five. In July 1953, a 100-word expansion [[Magnetic-core memory|core memory]] was added to the system, using [[binary-coded decimal]], [[excess-3]] number representation. To support this expansion memory, ENIAC was equipped with a new Function Table selector, a memory address selector, pulse-shaping circuits, and three new orders were added to the programming mechanism.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web |url=http://epictechnologyforgreatjustice.weebly.com/eniac.html |title=Eniac |last= |first= |date= |website=Epic Technology for Great Justice |language=en |access-date=2017-01-28}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison with other early computers==\n{{main|History of computing hardware}}\n<!--THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT ENIAC.

Happy editing! -->\n\nMechanical computing machines have been around since [[Archimedes]]' time (see: [[Antikythera mechanism]]), but the 1930s and 1940s are considered the beginning of the modern computer era.\n\nENIAC was, like the IBM [[Harvard Mark I]] and the German [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]], able to run an arbitrary sequence of mathematical operations, but did not read them from a tape. Like the British [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], it was programmed by plugboard and switches. ENIAC combined full, [[Turing-complete]] programmability with electronic speed. The [[Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer]] (ABC), ENIAC, and Colossus all used [[vacuum tube|thermionic valves (vacuum tubes)]]. ENIAC's registers performed decimal arithmetic, rather than binary arithmetic like the Z3, the ABC and Colossus.\n\nLike the Colossus, ENIAC required rewiring to reprogram until April 1948.<ref>See [[#Improvements]]</ref> In June 1948, the [[Manchester Baby]] ran its first program and earned the distinction of first electronic [[stored-program computer]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Programming the ENIAC: an example of why computer history is hard {{!}} @CHM Blog {{!}} Computer History Museum |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/programming-the-eniac-an-example-of-why-computer-history-is-hard/ |website=www.computerhistory.org |language=en|date=2016-05-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Haigh|first=Thomas|last2=Priestley|first2=Mark|last3=Rope|first3=Crispin|date=January\u2013March 2014|title=Reconsidering the Stored Program Concept|url=http://eniacinaction.com/the-articles/1-reconsidering-the-stored-program-concept/|journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing|volume=36|issue=1|pages=9\u201310|via=|doi=10.1109/mahc.2013.56}}</ref>{{sfn|Haigh|Priestley|Rope|2014|pp=48-54}} Though the idea of a stored-program computer with combined memory for program and data was conceived during the development of ENIAC, it was not initially implemented in ENIAC because World War II priorities required the machine to be completed quickly, and ENIAC's 20 storage locations would be too small to hold data and programs.\n\n===Public knowledge===\nThe Z3 and Colossus were developed independently of each other, and of the ABC and ENIAC during World War II. Work on the ABC at [[Iowa State University]] was stopped in 1942 after [[John Atanasoff]] was called to [[Washington, D.C.]], to do physics research for the U.S. Navy, and it was subsequently dismantled.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|p=106}} The Z3 was destroyed by the Allied bombing raids of Berlin in 1943. As the ten Colossus machines were part of the UK's war effort their existence remained secret until the late 1970s, although knowledge of their capabilities remained among their UK staff and invited Americans. ENIAC, by contrast, was put through its paces for the press in 1946, \"and captured the world's imagination\". Older histories of computing may therefore not be comprehensive in their coverage and analysis of this period. All but two of the Colossus machine were dismantled in 1945; the remaining two were used to decrypt Soviet messages by [[GCHQ]] until the 1960s.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|p=2}}<ref>{{Citation | last = Ward | first = Mark | title = How GCHQ built on a colossal secret | publisher = BBC News | date = 5 May 2014 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-26714967 }}</ref> The public demonstration for ENIAC was developed by Snyder and Jennings who created a demo that would calculate the trajectory of a missile in 15 seconds, a task that would have taken several weeks for a [[human computer]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Patent===\n{{main|Honeywell v.

He resettled in California and crossed paths with Rob Hotchkiss, who performed in coffee houses and local clubs. The two shared lead vocals, with Hotchkiss on guitar and harmonica, and Monahan playing percussion, including a modified conga attached to a kick-drum pedal. Hotchkiss had been the lead singer for L.A.-based Apostles. After deciding to form a full band, the duo recruited Jimmy Stafford on guitar, Charlie Colin on bass, and Scott Underwood on drums, thus solidifying Train's lineup in 1994. Train attempted to get signed under [[Columbia Records]] in 1996, but were rejected. Subsequently, the band decided to release their first self-titled CD independently. By 1997, they were touring nationally, opening concerts for bands such as [[Barenaked Ladies]], [[Hootie & the Blowfish]], [[Cracker (band)|Cracker]] and [[Counting Crows]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n=== 1998\u20132000: ''Train'' ===\n''[[Train (album)|Train]]'' is the band's eponymous debut album.

He resettled in California and crossed paths with Rob Hotchkiss, who performed in coffee houses and local clubs. The two shared lead vocals, with Hotchkiss on guitar and harmonica, and Monahan playing percussion, including a modified conga attached to a kick-drum pedal. Hotchkiss had been the lead singer for L.A.-based Apostles. After deciding to form a full band, the duo recruited Jimmy Stafford on guitar, Charlie Colin on bass, and Scott Underwood on drums, thus solidifying Train's lineup in 1994. Train attempted to get signed under [[Columbia Records]] in 1996, but were rejected. Subsequently, the band decided to release their first self-titled CD independently.

MacKinnon]]. In the book, the authors recount their experiences, including motivations and challenges, on restricting their diet, for one year, to include only foods grown within 100 miles of their residence. Beginning in March 2005, with little preparation the urban couple began only purchasing foods with ingredients they knew were all from within 100 miles. Finding little in grocery stores, they relied on [[farmers' market]]s and visits to local farms. Staples in their diet included [[seafood]], chicken, [[root vegetable]], berries, and [[Maize|corn]]. They lacked cooking oils, rice, and sugar. They preserved foods for use in the winter but ended with extra supplies.\n\nThe couple first wrote about the experience in articles for the online magazine ''[[The Tyee]]''. The popularity of the articles led to a book deal. In the book, Smith and MacKinnon each write alternate chapters, 12 in total. The first chapter is written by MacKinnon and focuses on the first month of their experience. They write in the first person as a memoir that explores their own dietary experiences and personal feelings.\n\nIn the Canadian market, the book spent five weeks on ''[[Maclean's]]'' nonfiction bestseller list. The book spent 20 weeks on ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'s'' nonfiction bestseller list. The authors won the Roderick Haig-Brown Regional Prize from the British Columbia Booksellers Association for the best contribution to the enjoyment and understanding of British Columbia. The 100-mile diet concept, along with advocates of [[local food]], were covered by media across North America. In 2009, [[Food Network (Canada)|Food Network Canada]] aired ''[[The 100 Mile Challenge]]'', a television series co-created by MacKinnon and Smith and based on the book.\n\n==Background==\nAlisa Smith and J.

The couple, both in their 30s, each had experience in writing: Smith as a freelance journalist who had taught non-fiction writing, and MacKinnon as the author of the [[Charles Taylor Prize|award-winning]] historical non-fiction book ''Dead Man in Paradise'' and a past editor of ''[[Adbusters]]'' magazine.<ref name=Simonds>{{cite news |first = Merilyn |last = Simonds |title = Food for thought about what we eat |work = [[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |location = Montreal |date = 5 May 2007 |page = J6}}</ref>\n\nThey were overwhelmed by the response, first from other [[locavore]]s and then from local and international news media.<ref>{{cite news |first = Tracy |last = Loew |title = Couple think globally by eating locally |work = [[USA Today]] |url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2006-06-09-100-mile-diet_x.htm |accessdate=2008-08-23 |date = 6 September 2006 |page = D5}}</ref> Eleven articles were published in ''The Tyee'' series over the year, plus an additional four articles afterwards, between August 2006 and May 2007. They launched an independent website, 100milediet.org, in April 2006 and began writing the book. [[Random House]] published the hardcover version on 12 March 2007 in Canada as ''The 100 Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating'' and on 24 April in the United States as ''Plenty: One Man, One Woman, and a Raucous Year of Eating Locally''. The [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] was released in Canada by Random House's Vintage Canada imprint on 2 October and in the United States by the [[Three Rivers Press]] imprint on 22 April 2008.\n\n==Content==\nThe book consists of twelve chapters, plus an Epilogue and an Acknowledgements section at the end. Smith and MacKinnon individually write alternating chapters, each of which covers one month from March 2005 to February 2006. In the first chapter MacKinnon tells how his idea for the 100-mile diet began and Smith agrees to try it for one year. They begin symbolically on the first day of Spring, March 21, and define 'local' as 100 miles, a convenient radius that would include the [[Lower Mainland]], the southern half of [[Vancouver Island]], and [[Whatcom County]] and [[Skagit County]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]]. Their exceptions to this rule include meals eaten while traveling, meals prepared by friends, and business lunches. Their initial month was expensive as they scoured grocery stores for whatever they could find. In the second chapter, Smith describes her and MacKinnon as an unwed urban couple in their early thirties with no children and living in a rented apartment. They recount how eating impacted their relationship before and after the diet, the anonymity of prepackaged foods, the traceability of their diet, and the diets of the [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]].\n\nThe [[farmers' market]] opens in May and they are able to buy local honey to replace sugar. Seafood from the [[Strait of Georgia]] becomes a staple in their diet. The couple spend August at their cabin in northwestern BC where they fish the [[Skeena River]], pick wild berries, and eat whatever grows in their garden. Back in the Lower Mainland, the September harvest provides them with melons, peppers, eggplant, grapes, and tomatoes. To prepare for winter they preserved corn and tomatoes, made jam from berries, collected herbs from their community garden, and bought many potatoes.\n\nDuring the fall, each write on the troubles in their relationship. [[David Beers]], the founder of the ''Tyee'', hosts a 100-mile [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Thanksgiving]] dinner for Smith while MacKinnon was away. In November, during a family emergency, MacKinnon travels to [[Kamloops]] where he suspends his 100-mile diet a few days. They finally find a source of flour when they discover a farmer on Vancouver Island who grows his own fruits, vegetables, meats, and wheat. In December, Smith travels to [[Edmonton]] where her grandmother feeds her microwaved pasta which she accepts.\n\nIn January they find a restaurant that specializes in local cuisine and, previously vegetarians, they cook and eat beef for the first time in years. Working in [[Malawi]], MacKinnon is struck by the contrast between their western diet and that of the poor country's: there is ample food supplies in Malawi but most is exported to Canada and the United States who buy the food they do not require. The couple learn about [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] and [[Maya cuisine]] while in [[Merida, Mexico]] for a wedding. The book ends with an epilogue, written by both Smith and MacKinnon six months after their one-year diet. They make a symbolic journey to [[Bamfield]], within their 100-mile radius, to collect sea water for its salt and prove they could obtain their own salt supply.\n\n==Style and genre==\nThe book uses a first person memoir style with Smith and MacKinnon taking turns writing each chapter.<ref name=Coppard/><ref name=Wilkins>{{cite news |first = Charles |last = Wilkins |title = Think globally, shop locally, eat really well |work = [[The Globe and Mail]] |location = Toronto |date = 21 April 2007 |page = D1}}</ref> The authors purposely avoided writing a self-help book in favour of the memoir style, saying, \"We wanted to show readers that process, and how it affected us and let them see it through our eyes.\"<ref name=Giese/> The topics sometimes go beyond the motivations and challenges of the diet into more personal relationship issues.

The couple, both in their 30s, each had experience in writing: Smith as a freelance journalist who had taught non-fiction writing, and MacKinnon as the author of the [[Charles Taylor Prize|award-winning]] historical non-fiction book ''Dead Man in Paradise'' and a past editor of ''[[Adbusters]]'' magazine.<ref name=Simonds>{{cite news |first = Merilyn |last = Simonds |title = Food for thought about what we eat |work = [[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |location = Montreal |date = 5 May 2007 |page = J6}}</ref>\n\nThey were overwhelmed by the response, first from other [[locavore]]s and then from local and international news media.<ref>{{cite news |first = Tracy |last = Loew |title = Couple think globally by eating locally |work = [[USA Today]] |url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2006-06-09-100-mile-diet_x.htm |accessdate=2008-08-23 |date = 6 September 2006 |page = D5}}</ref> Eleven articles were published in ''The Tyee'' series over the year, plus an additional four articles afterwards, between August 2006 and May 2007. They launched an independent website, 100milediet.org, in April 2006 and began writing the book. [[Random House]] published the hardcover version on 12 March 2007 in Canada as ''The 100 Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating'' and on 24 April in the United States as ''Plenty: One Man, One Woman, and a Raucous Year of Eating Locally''. The [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] was released in Canada by Random House's Vintage Canada imprint on 2 October and in the United States by the [[Three Rivers Press]] imprint on 22 April 2008.\n\n==Content==\nThe book consists of twelve chapters, plus an Epilogue and an Acknowledgements section at the end. Smith and MacKinnon individually write alternating chapters, each of which covers one month from March 2005 to February 2006. In the first chapter MacKinnon tells how his idea for the 100-mile diet began and Smith agrees to try it for one year. They begin symbolically on the first day of Spring, March 21, and define 'local' as 100 miles, a convenient radius that would include the [[Lower Mainland]], the southern half of [[Vancouver Island]], and [[Whatcom County]] and [[Skagit County]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]]. Their exceptions to this rule include meals eaten while traveling, meals prepared by friends, and business lunches. Their initial month was expensive as they scoured grocery stores for whatever they could find. In the second chapter, Smith describes her and MacKinnon as an unwed urban couple in their early thirties with no children and living in a rented apartment. They recount how eating impacted their relationship before and after the diet, the anonymity of prepackaged foods, the traceability of their diet, and the diets of the [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]].\n\nThe [[farmers' market]] opens in May and they are able to buy local honey to replace sugar. Seafood from the [[Strait of Georgia]] becomes a staple in their diet. The couple spend August at their cabin in northwestern BC where they fish the [[Skeena River]], pick wild berries, and eat whatever grows in their garden. Back in the Lower Mainland, the September harvest provides them with melons, peppers, eggplant, grapes, and tomatoes. To prepare for winter they preserved corn and tomatoes, made jam from berries, collected herbs from their community garden, and bought many potatoes.\n\nDuring the fall, each write on the troubles in their relationship. [[David Beers]], the founder of the ''Tyee'', hosts a 100-mile [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Thanksgiving]] dinner for Smith while MacKinnon was away. In November, during a family emergency, MacKinnon travels to [[Kamloops]] where he suspends his 100-mile diet a few days. They finally find a source of flour when they discover a farmer on Vancouver Island who grows his own fruits, vegetables, meats, and wheat. In December, Smith travels to [[Edmonton]] where her grandmother feeds her microwaved pasta which she accepts.\n\nIn January they find a restaurant that specializes in local cuisine and, previously vegetarians, they cook and eat beef for the first time in years. Working in [[Malawi]], MacKinnon is struck by the contrast between their western diet and that of the poor country's: there is ample food supplies in Malawi but most is exported to Canada and the United States who buy the food they do not require. The couple learn about [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] and [[Maya cuisine]] while in [[Merida, Mexico]] for a wedding. The book ends with an epilogue, written by both Smith and MacKinnon six months after their one-year diet. They make a symbolic journey to [[Bamfield]], within their 100-mile radius, to collect sea water for its salt and prove they could obtain their own salt supply.\n\n==Style and genre==\nThe book uses a first person memoir style with Smith and MacKinnon taking turns writing each chapter.<ref name=Coppard/><ref name=Wilkins>{{cite news |first = Charles |last = Wilkins |title = Think globally, shop locally, eat really well |work = [[The Globe and Mail]] |location = Toronto |date = 21 April 2007 |page = D1}}</ref> The authors purposely avoided writing a self-help book in favour of the memoir style, saying, \"We wanted to show readers that process, and how it affected us and let them see it through our eyes.\"<ref name=Giese/> The topics sometimes go beyond the motivations and challenges of the diet into more personal relationship issues.

The bright and cheerful Emma always aces the regular exams with her two best friends, Ray and Norman. The orphans are allowed complete freedom, except to venture beyond the grounds or the gate, which connects the house to the outside world.\n\nOne night, an orphan named Conny is sent away to be adopted, but Emma and Norman followed her after noticing that she left her stuffed toy, Little Bunny, back at the house. At the gate, they find Conny dead, and they realize the truth of their existence in this idyllic orphanage\u2014to be \"humanely\" raised, eventually butchered, and sold as meat to a \"higher\" species which were identified as \"demons\" throughout the series.

They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required.

[[Cryptography]] is the practice and study of hiding (encryption) and therefore deciphering (decryption) information. Modern cryptography is largely related to computer science, for many encryption and decryption algorithms are based on their computational complexity.\n\n====Databases====\n{{main|Database}}\n{{Missing information|a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.|date=September 2018}}\nA database is intended to organize, store, and retrieve large amounts of data easily. Digital databases are managed using database management systems to store, create, maintain, and search data, through [[database model]]s and [[query language]]s.\n\n===Computer applications===\n\n====Computer graphics and visualization====\n{{main|Computer graphics (computer science)}}\nComputer graphics is the study of digital visual contents and involves the synthesis and manipulation of image data. The study is connected to many other fields in computer science, including [[computer vision]], [[image processing]], and [[computational geometry]], and is heavily applied in the fields of special effects and [[video game]]s.\n\n====Human\u2013computer interaction====\n{{main|Human\u2013computer interaction}}\nResearch that develops theories, principles, and guidelines for user interface designers, so they can create satisfactory user experiences with desktop, laptop, and mobile devices.\n\n====Scientific computing and simulation====\n[[Scientific computing]] (or [[computational science]]) is the field of study concerned with constructing [[scientific modelling|mathematical models]] and [[numerical analysis|quantitative analysis]] techniques and using computers to analyze and solve [[Science|scientific]] problems. A major usage of scientific computing is [[simulation]] of various processes, including computational [[fluid dynamics]], physical, electrical, and electronic systems and circuits, as well as societies and social situations (notably war games) along with their habitats, among many others. Modern computers enable optimization of such designs as complete aircraft. Notable in electrical and electronic circuit design are SPICE,<ref>Muhammad H. Rashid, 2016. SPICE for Power Electronics and Electric Power. CRC Press. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-1-4398-6047-2}}.</ref> as well as software for physical realization of new (or modified) designs.

From its origins in [[cybernetics]] and in the [[History of artificial intelligence|Dartmouth Conference]] (1956), artificial intelligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary, drawing on areas of expertise such as [[applied mathematics]], [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], [[semiotics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[neurophysiology]], and [[social intelligence]]. AI is associated in the popular mind with [[Robotics|robotic development]], but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of [[software development]], which require computational understanding. The starting point in the late 1940s was [[Alan Turing]]'s question \"Can computers think?\", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the [[Turing test]] is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; text-align:center; margin:auto;\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|-\n| [[File:Nicolas P.

It is a systematic approach to software design, involving the application of engineering practices to software. Software engineering deals with the organizing and analyzing of software\u2014it doesn't just deal with the creation or manufacture of new software, but its internal maintenance and arrangement.\n\n==Discoveries==\nThe philosopher of computing [[William J. Rapaport|Bill Rapaport]] noted three ''Great Insights of Computer Science'':<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/computation.html|title=What Is Computation?|publisher=State University of New York at Buffalo|last = Rapaport|first = William J.|date = 20 September 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]'s, [[George Boole]]'s, [[Alan Turing]]'s, [[Claude Shannon]]'s, and [[Samuel Morse]]'s insight: there are only ''two objects'' that a computer has to deal with in order to represent \"anything\".{{refn |group=\"note\"|The word \"anything\" is written in quotation marks because there are things that computers cannot do. One example is: to answer the question if an arbitrary given computer program will eventually finish or run forever (the [[Halting problem]]).}}\n:: All the information about any computable problem can be represented using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such as \"on/off\", \"magnetized/de-magnetized\", \"high-voltage/low-voltage\", etc.).\n{{see also|Digital physics}}\n* [[Alan Turing]]'s insight: there are only ''five actions'' that a computer has to perform in order to do \"anything\".\n:: Every algorithm can be expressed in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:<ref>B.

Cengage Learning. p. 122. {{ISBN|0-538-47866-7}}.</ref>\n\n:: Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic instructions into more complex ones:\n::*''sequence'': first do this, then do that;\n::* '' selection'': IF such-and-such is the case, THEN do this, ELSE do that;\n::* ''repetition'': WHILE such-and-such is the case, DO this.\n:: Note that the three rules of Boehm's and Jacopini's insight can be further simplified with the use of [[goto]] (which means it is more elementary than [[structured programming]]).\n{{see also|Elementary function arithmetic#Friedman's grand conjecture}}\n\n==Programming paradigms==\n{{main|Programming paradigm}}\n\nProgramming languages can be used to accomplish different tasks in different ways. Common programming paradigms include:\n\n* [[Functional programming]], a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.<ref>Md. Rezaul Karim; Sridhar Alla; 2017. Scala and Spark for Big Data Analytics: Explore the concepts of functional programming, data streaming, and machine learning. Packt Publishing Ltd. p. 87. {{ISBN|978-1-78355-050-0}}.</ref>\n* [[Imperative programming]], a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.<ref>Lex Sheehan, 2017. Learning Functional Programming in Go: Change the way you approach your applications using functional programming in Go. Packt Publishing Ltd. p. 16. {{ISBN|978-1-78728-604-7}}.</ref> In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.\n* [[Object-oriented programming]], a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus Object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.<ref>Evelio Padilla, 2015. Substation Automation Systems: Design and Implementation. Wiley. p. 245. {{ISBN|978-1-118-98730-8}}.</ref>\n\nMany languages offer support for multiple paradigms, making the distinction more a matter of style than of technical capabilities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Multi-Paradigm Programming Language |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/multiparadigmlanguage.html |website=developer.mozilla.org |publisher=[[Mozilla Foundation]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821052407/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/multiparadigmlanguage.html |archive-date=21 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Academia==\n{{further|List of computer science conferences|Category:Computer science journals}}\nConferences are important events for computer science research.

Computer science departments with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientation consider alignment with [[computational science]]. Both types of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field educationally if not across all research.\n\n==Philosophy==\n{{main|Philosophy of computer science}}\nA number of computer scientists have argued for the distinction of three separate paradigms in computer science.

They form an important theoretical underpinning for software engineering, especially where safety or security is involved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testing since they help avoid errors and can also give a framework for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required. However, the high cost of using formal methods means that they are usually only used in the development of high-integrity and [[life-critical system]]s, where safety or [[computer security|security]] is of utmost importance. Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of [[theoretical computer science]] fundamentals, in particular [[logic in computer science|logic]] calculi, [[formal language]]s, [[automata theory]], and [[program semantics]], but also [[type systems]] and [[algebraic data types]] to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.\n\n===Computer systems===\n\n====Computer architecture and computer engineering====\n{{main|Computer architecture|Computer engineering}}\nComputer architecture, or digital computer organization, is the conceptual design and fundamental operational structure of a computer system.

AI is associated in the popular mind with [[Robotics|robotic development]], but the main field of practical application has been as an embedded component in areas of [[software development]], which require computational understanding. The starting point in the late 1940s was [[Alan Turing]]'s question \"Can computers think?\", and the question remains effectively unanswered, although the [[Turing test]] is still used to assess computer output on the scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluative and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains of computer application involving complex real-world data.\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; text-align:center; margin:auto;\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|-\n| [[File:Nicolas P.

Common programming paradigms include:\n\n* [[Functional programming]], a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.<ref>Md. Rezaul Karim; Sridhar Alla; 2017.

Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.\n* [[Object-oriented programming]], a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. Thus Object-oriented computer programs are made out of objects that interact with one another.<ref>Evelio Padilla, 2015. Substation Automation Systems: Design and Implementation.

Murray was also a co-developer, with [[Christiana Morgan]], of the [[Thematic Apperception Test]] (TAT), which he referred to as \"the second best-seller that Harvard ever published, second only to the Harvard Handbook of Music.\" \n\n==Early life & education==\n\nMurray was born in New York City into a wealthy family of Henry Alexander Murray, Sr., and Fannie Morris Babcock,  daughter of financier Samuel Denison Babcock.<ref name=\"ANB\">{{Cite ANB|title=Murray, Henry Alexander, Jr. |id=1400869 |first=Eugene |last=Taylor}}</ref> Murray had an older sister and a younger brother. Carver and Scheier note that \"he got on well with his father but had a poor relationship with his mother\", resulting in a deep-seated feeling of [[depression (mood)|depression]].

At [[Columbia University]] he did much better in [[medicine]], completed his M.D. and also received an M.A. in [[biology]], in 1919. For the next two years he was an instructor in physiology at Harvard. \nHe received his doctorate in [[biochemistry]] from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1928, aged 35.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn 1916, Murray married, aged 23, and after seven years of marriage, in 1923, he met and fell in love with [[Christiana Morgan]]. He experienced a serious conflict as he did not want to leave his wife, Josephine. This was a turning point in Murray's life as it raised his awareness of conflicting needs, the pressure that can result, and the links to motivation. Carver and Scheier note that it was Morgan who was \"fascinated by the psychology of Carl Jung\" and it was as a result of her urging that he met [[Carl Jung]] in Switzerland.<ref name=carve/> He described Jung as \"The first full blooded, spherical\u2014and Goethean, I would say, intelligence I had ever met.\" He was analyzed by him and studied his works. \"The experience of bringing a problem to a psychologist and receiving an answer that seemed to work had a great impact on Murray, leading him to seriously consider psychology as a career\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = J.

He developed the concepts of latent needs (not openly displayed), manifest needs (observed in people's actions), \"press\" (external influences on motivation) and \"thema\"\u2014\"a pattern of press and need that coalesces around particular interactions\". {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nMurray collaborated with [[Stanley Cobb]], Bullard Professor of Neuropathology at the Medical School, to introduce psychoanalysis into the Harvard curriculum but to keep those who taught it away from the decision-making apparatus in Vienna.  He and Cobb set the stage for the founding of the [[Boston Psychoanalytic Society]] after 1931, but both were excluded from membership on political grounds.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n \nIn 1935, Murray and Morgan developed the concept of apperception and the assumption that everyone's thinking is shaped by subjective processes, the rationale behind the [[Thematic apperception test]]. They used the term \"apperception\" to refer to the process of projecting fantasy imagery onto an objective stimulus.\n\nIn 1937, Murray became director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic. \nIn 1938 he published ''Explorations in Personality'', a classic in psychology, which includes a description of the Thematic Apperception Test. \nIn 1938 Murray acted as a consultant for the British Government, setting up the Officer Selection Board. Murray's work at The Harvard Psychological Clinic enabled him to apply his theories in the design of the selection processes with a \"situation test\", an assessment based on practical tasks and activities, an analysis of ''specific criteria'' (e.g. \"leadership\") by a number of raters across a range of activities. Results were pooled to achieve an overall assessment.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===World War II, Office of Strategic Services, 1939-45===\nDuring [[World War II]], he left Harvard and worked as [[lieutenant colonel]] for the [[Office of Strategic Services|Office of Strategic Services (OSS)]]. James Miller, in charge of the selection of secret agents at the OSS during World War ll, said the situation test was used by British War Officer Selection Board and OSS to assess potential agents.\n\nIn 1943 Murray helped complete ''[[Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler]]'', commissioned by OSS boss MGen. [[William Joseph Donovan|William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan]]. The report was done in collaboration with [[psychoanalyst]] [[Walter C. Langer]], Dr. Ernst Kris, [[New School for Social Research]], and Dr. [[Bertram D. Lewin]], [[New York Psychoanalytic Institute]]. The report used many sources to profile [[Hitler]], including informants such as [[Ernst Hanfstaengl]], [[Hermann Rauschning]], [[Stephanie von Hohenlohe|Princess Stephanie von Hohenlohe]], [[Gregor Strasser]], [[Friedelinde Wagner]], and [[Kurt Ludecke]]. The groundbreaking study was the pioneer of [[offender profiling]] and political psychology. In addition to predicting that Hitler would choose suicide if defeat for Germany was near, Murray's collaborative report stated that Hitler was impotent as far as [[heterosexual]] relations were concerned and that there was a possibility that Hitler had participated in a [[homosexual]] relationship. The report stated: \"The belief that Hitler is homosexual has probably developed (a) from the fact that he does show so many [[Femininity|feminine]] characteristics, and (b) from the fact that there were so many homosexuals in the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Party]] during the early days and many continue to occupy important positions. It is probably true that Hitler calls [[Albert Forster]] \"Bubi\", which is a common nickname employed by homosexuals in addressing their partners.\"\n\n===Harvard human experiments, 1959-62===\nIn 1947, he returned to Harvard as a chief researcher, lectured and established with others the ''Psychological Clinic Annex''.\n\nFrom late 1959 to early 1962, Murray was responsible for unethical experiments in which he used twenty-two Harvard undergraduates as research subjects.<ref name = Unabomber>{{cite news | author = Chase A | date = 2000-06-01 | title = Harvard and the Making of the Unabomber | publisher = [[The Atlantic Monthly]] | pages = 41\u201365 | accessdate = 2008-10-16 | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2000/06/chase.htm }}</ref> \nAmong other goals, experiments sought to measure individuals' responses to extreme stress. The unwitting undergraduates were submitted to what Murray called \"vehement, sweeping and personally abusive\" attacks. Specifically-tailored assaults to their egos, cherished ideas and beliefs were used to cause high levels of stress and [[distress (medicine)|distress]]. The subjects then viewed recorded footage of their reactions to this verbal abuse repeatedly.\n\nAmong them was 17-year-old [[Ted Kaczynski]], a mathematician who went on to become the [[Unabomber]], a domestic terrorist targeting academics and technologists for 18 years.<ref name=chase>{{cite book | last = Chase | first = Alston | title = Harvard and the Unabomber The Education of an American Terrorist | publisher = [[W.

Murray viewed an individual's entire life as one unit, and pointed out that although a specific element of a person's life can be studied through psychology, this studied episode gives an incomplete picture of the entire life unit. To properly analyze the entire life cycle, Murray favored a narrative approach to studying personality, which he called \"personology\". The personological system has been used as an approach for multiple academic disciplines: philosophy, humanism, biological chemistry, and societal and cultural studies.\n\nMurray divided personology into five principles: (1) Cerebral physiology, rooted in the brain, governs all aspects of personality. (2) People act to reduce physiological and psychological tension to gain satisfaction, but do not strive to be tension-free, and rather cycle between seeking excitement, activity and movement in their lives and then relaxing. (3) An individual's personality continues to develop over time and is influenced by all of the events that occur over a person's lifetime. (4) Personality is not fixed and it can change and progress, and (5) Each person has some unique characteristics and others which are shared by everyone.\n\nMurray's theory of personality is rooted in psychoanalysis, and the chief business and aim of personology is the reconstruction of the individual's past life experiences in order to explain their present behavior. To study personality, Murray used free association and dream analysis to bring unconscious material to light. Murray's personality theories have been questioned by some psychologists,<ref>{{cite book|title=Obeying the Voice of God: Jack MacDonald's Journey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3BAERfC1k2EC&pg=PA11|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Brian Van Brunt|isbn=978-0-9778545-1-6|pages=11\u2013}}</ref> and extended by others, such as D.

McClelland, Boyatzis and Spencer went on to found the McBer Consultancy. However, Murray's contribution is rarely acknowledged in contemporary academic literature.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n''Explorations in Personality''  underlying principles were later adopted by AT&T in the development of [[the Assessment Centre]] methodology, now widely used to assess management potential in both private and public sector organisations.\n\n==Works==\n===Books===\n* Murray, H.

He developed the concepts of latent needs (not openly displayed), manifest needs (observed in people's actions), \"press\" (external influences on motivation) and \"thema\"\u2014\"a pattern of press and need that coalesces around particular interactions\". {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nMurray collaborated with [[Stanley Cobb]], Bullard Professor of Neuropathology at the Medical School, to introduce psychoanalysis into the Harvard curriculum but to keep those who taught it away from the decision-making apparatus in Vienna.  He and Cobb set the stage for the founding of the [[Boston Psychoanalytic Society]] after 1931, but both were excluded from membership on political grounds.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n \nIn 1935, Murray and Morgan developed the concept of apperception and the assumption that everyone's thinking is shaped by subjective processes, the rationale behind the [[Thematic apperception test]]. They used the term \"apperception\" to refer to the process of projecting fantasy imagery onto an objective stimulus.\n\nIn 1937, Murray became director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic. \nIn 1938 he published ''Explorations in Personality'', a classic in psychology, which includes a description of the Thematic Apperception Test. \nIn 1938 Murray acted as a consultant for the British Government, setting up the Officer Selection Board. Murray's work at The Harvard Psychological Clinic enabled him to apply his theories in the design of the selection processes with a \"situation test\", an assessment based on practical tasks and activities, an analysis of ''specific criteria'' (e.g. \"leadership\") by a number of raters across a range of activities. Results were pooled to achieve an overall assessment.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===World War II, Office of Strategic Services, 1939-45===\nDuring [[World War II]], he left Harvard and worked as [[lieutenant colonel]] for the [[Office of Strategic Services|Office of Strategic Services (OSS)]]. James Miller, in charge of the selection of secret agents at the OSS during World War ll, said the situation test was used by British War Officer Selection Board and OSS to assess potential agents.\n\nIn 1943 Murray helped complete ''[[Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler]]'', commissioned by OSS boss MGen. [[William Joseph Donovan|William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan]]. The report was done in collaboration with [[psychoanalyst]] [[Walter C. Langer]], Dr. Ernst Kris, [[New School for Social Research]], and Dr. [[Bertram D. Lewin]], [[New York Psychoanalytic Institute]]. The report used many sources to profile [[Hitler]], including informants such as [[Ernst Hanfstaengl]], [[Hermann Rauschning]], [[Stephanie von Hohenlohe|Princess Stephanie von Hohenlohe]], [[Gregor Strasser]], [[Friedelinde Wagner]], and [[Kurt Ludecke]]. The groundbreaking study was the pioneer of [[offender profiling]] and political psychology. In addition to predicting that Hitler would choose suicide if defeat for Germany was near, Murray's collaborative report stated that Hitler was impotent as far as [[heterosexual]] relations were concerned and that there was a possibility that Hitler had participated in a [[homosexual]] relationship. The report stated: \"The belief that Hitler is homosexual has probably developed (a) from the fact that he does show so many [[Femininity|feminine]] characteristics, and (b) from the fact that there were so many homosexuals in the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Party]] during the early days and many continue to occupy important positions. It is probably true that Hitler calls [[Albert Forster]] \"Bubi\", which is a common nickname employed by homosexuals in addressing their partners.\"\n\n===Harvard human experiments, 1959-62===\nIn 1947, he returned to Harvard as a chief researcher, lectured and established with others the ''Psychological Clinic Annex''.\n\nFrom late 1959 to early 1962, Murray was responsible for unethical experiments in which he used twenty-two Harvard undergraduates as research subjects.<ref name = Unabomber>{{cite news | author = Chase A | date = 2000-06-01 | title = Harvard and the Making of the Unabomber | publisher = [[The Atlantic Monthly]] | pages = 41\u201365 | accessdate = 2008-10-16 | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2000/06/chase.htm }}</ref> \nAmong other goals, experiments sought to measure individuals' responses to extreme stress. The unwitting undergraduates were submitted to what Murray called \"vehement, sweeping and personally abusive\" attacks. Specifically-tailored assaults to their egos, cherished ideas and beliefs were used to cause high levels of stress and [[distress (medicine)|distress]]. The subjects then viewed recorded footage of their reactions to this verbal abuse repeatedly.\n\nAmong them was 17-year-old [[Ted Kaczynski]], a mathematician who went on to become the [[Unabomber]], a domestic terrorist targeting academics and technologists for 18 years.<ref name=chase>{{cite book | last = Chase | first = Alston | title = Harvard and the Unabomber The Education of an American Terrorist | publisher = [[W.

Murray viewed an individual's entire life as one unit, and pointed out that although a specific element of a person's life can be studied through psychology, this studied episode gives an incomplete picture of the entire life unit. To properly analyze the entire life cycle, Murray favored a narrative approach to studying personality, which he called \"personology\". The personological system has been used as an approach for multiple academic disciplines: philosophy, humanism, biological chemistry, and societal and cultural studies.\n\nMurray divided personology into five principles: (1) Cerebral physiology, rooted in the brain, governs all aspects of personality. (2) People act to reduce physiological and psychological tension to gain satisfaction, but do not strive to be tension-free, and rather cycle between seeking excitement, activity and movement in their lives and then relaxing. (3) An individual's personality continues to develop over time and is influenced by all of the events that occur over a person's lifetime. (4) Personality is not fixed and it can change and progress, and (5) Each person has some unique characteristics and others which are shared by everyone.\n\nMurray's theory of personality is rooted in psychoanalysis, and the chief business and aim of personology is the reconstruction of the individual's past life experiences in order to explain their present behavior. To study personality, Murray used free association and dream analysis to bring unconscious material to light. Murray's personality theories have been questioned by some psychologists,<ref>{{cite book|title=Obeying the Voice of God: Jack MacDonald's Journey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3BAERfC1k2EC&pg=PA11|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Brian Van Brunt|isbn=978-0-9778545-1-6|pages=11\u2013}}</ref> and extended by others, such as D.

McClelland, Boyatzis and Spencer went on to found the McBer Consultancy. However, Murray's contribution is rarely acknowledged in contemporary academic literature.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n''Explorations in Personality''  underlying principles were later adopted by AT&T in the development of [[the Assessment Centre]] methodology, now widely used to assess management potential in both private and public sector organisations.\n\n==Works==\n===Books===\n* Murray, H.
