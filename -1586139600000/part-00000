W. Bush]].\n\nDespite this, however, the Democrats lost a net of nine seats in the House to the Republicans, in part due to [[redistricting]] following the [[1990 United States Census|1990 Census]]. The Democrats nonetheless retained a majority in the House and [[United States Senate|Senate]].\n\nThis election was the first using districts drawn on the basis of the 1990 Census. The redrawn districts were notable for the increase in majority-minority districts, drawn as mandated by the [[Voting Rights Act]]. The 1980 Census resulted in 17 majority-black districts and 10 majority-Hispanic districts, but 32 and 19 such districts, respectively, were drawn after 1990.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pear |first1=Robert |title=THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Congressional Districts; Redistricting Expected to Bring Surge in Minority Lawmakers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/03/us/1992-campaign-congressional-districts-redistricting-expected-bring-surge.html |accessdate=September 4, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 3, 1992}}</ref>\n\n==Overall results==\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|+ \u2193\n\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:59.31%\" | 258\n| style=\"background:{{Other/meta/color}}; width:0.23%\" | 1\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:40.46%\" | 176\n\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Democratic'''</span>\n| {{efn | There was 1 Independent}}\n| <span style=\"color:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Republican'''</span>\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n\n|- valign=bottom\n! rowspan=2 colspan=2 | Party\n! colspan=3 | Seats\n! rowspan=2 | Share\n! rowspan=2 colspan=2 | Popular vote\n\n|- valign=bottom\n!

W. Bush]].\n\nDespite this, however, the Democrats lost a net of nine seats in the House to the Republicans, in part due to [[redistricting]] following the [[1990 United States Census|1990 Census]]. The Democrats nonetheless retained a majority in the House and [[United States Senate|Senate]].\n\nThis election was the first using districts drawn on the basis of the 1990 Census. The redrawn districts were notable for the increase in majority-minority districts, drawn as mandated by the [[Voting Rights Act]]. The 1980 Census resulted in 17 majority-black districts and 10 majority-Hispanic districts, but 32 and 19 such districts, respectively, were drawn after 1990.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pear |first1=Robert |title=THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Congressional Districts; Redistricting Expected to Bring Surge in Minority Lawmakers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/03/us/1992-campaign-congressional-districts-redistricting-expected-bring-surge.html |accessdate=September 4, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 3, 1992}}</ref>\n\n==Overall results==\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|+ \u2193\n\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:59.31%\" | 258\n| style=\"background:{{Other/meta/color}}; width:0.23%\" | 1\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:40.46%\" | 176\n\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Democratic'''</span>\n| {{efn | There was 1 Independent}}\n| <span style=\"color:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Republican'''</span>\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n\n|- valign=bottom\n! rowspan=2 colspan=2 | Party\n! colspan=3 | Seats\n! rowspan=2 | Share\n! rowspan=2 colspan=2 | Popular vote\n\n|- valign=bottom\n!

Television]] and [[DC Entertainment]] for [[NBC]], based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Wonder Woman|of the same name]]. [[David E. Kelley]] wrote the pilot, which was directed by [[Jeffrey Reiner]]. [[Adrianne Palicki]] starred as the main character.\n\nThe ''Wonder Woman'' pilot was expected to debut in 2011, but NBC opted not to buy the series.\n\n[[Pedro Pascal]], who played Ed Indelicato in the pilot, was later cast in another Wonder Woman related project, the 2020 movie ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2394822/wonder-woman-2-has-added-a-narcos-star|title=Wonder Woman 2 Has Added A Game Of Thrones Star|website=Cinema Blend|date=March 29, 2018|accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn an inner city home a teenager tells his family that he has been accepted to college moments before he begins convulsing and bleeding from the eyes and ears. Meanwhile, Wonder Woman is in a foot chase with a super-strength criminal on Hollywood Blvd and, after knocking him out, takes a sample of his blood and leaves him to the police. Wonder Woman returns to the headquarters of Themyscira Industries, a large corporation which she runs as the CEO in her alter-ego of Diana Themyscira. Themyscira Industries owns and operates the concept of Wonder Woman as both a privately run crime fighting operation and for marketing the image of Wonder Woman as a role model to the outside world. Diana has trouble balancing her life as both the CEO of the corporation and as Wonder Woman. Diana's frustration with having to maintain a perfect image to the outside world in both these capacities leads her to create a third identity for herself, \"Diana Prince,\" so that she can have an element of normalcy in her life and sit at home with her cat watching romantic comedies and surfing the internet. At Themyscira Industries Diana grows suspicious of evil businesswoman [[Veronica Cale]] for distributing an illegal [[performance-enhancing drug]] that gives users super-human strength and endurance, but can cause death through repeated use.\n\nThe blood sample she draws from the Hollywood Blvd fight and the story of the college-bound teen confirm Diana's suspicions. Without enough hard evidence to bring Cale to justice as Wonder Woman, Diana holds a press conference and airs her beliefs about Cale to the world. Cale in turn confronts Diana in person to intimidate her and threaten legal action. In a flashback, Diana ends up breaking it off with her boyfriend [[Steve Trevor]] because of her busy life. Back in present day, the college-bound teenager dies from his drug sickness and Diana is galvanized to confront Cale as Wonder Woman. She arrives at Cale's facilities, defeats all of her super-powered henchmen and confronts Cale face-to-face. Cale threatens legal action and to release security footage of Wonder Woman killing the henchmen, but Wonder Woman responds by pulling Cale down with her lasso and throwing her against the wall. Later Cale is put in jail and a Justice Department representative comes to meet Diana. This turns out to be Steve Trevor who says that he will be working with Diana in her capacity as Wonder Woman but also reveals that he has married another woman.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n*[[Adrianne Palicki]] as [[Wonder Woman|Diana Prince / Diana Themyscira / Princess Diana of Themyscira / Wonder Woman]], the title role.<ref name=wonder/>\n*[[Elizabeth Hurley]] as [[Veronica Cale]], the villain.<ref name=hurleythoms>{{cite news | url = http://www.deadline.com/2011/03/elizabeth-hurley-joins-nbcs-wonder-woman/ | title = Elizabeth Hurley & Tracie Thoms Join NBC's 'Wonder Woman' | first = Nellie | last = Andreeva |date = March 3, 2011 | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]] | accessdate = March 3, 2011}}</ref>\n*[[Tracie Thoms]] as [[Etta Candy]], Diana's personal assistant.<ref name=hurleythoms/>\n*[[Pedro Pascal]] as Ed Indelicato, Wonder Woman's liaison to the police department.<ref name=pascal>{{cite news | url = http://www.deadline.com/2011/03/the-river-awakening-find-their-leads-two-board-tagged-wonder-woman/ | title = 'The River' & 'Awakening' Find Their Leads, Two Board 'Tagged' & 'Wonder Woman' | first = Nellie | last = Andreeva |date = March 3, 2011 | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]] | accessdate = March 4, 2011}}</ref>\n*[[Cary Elwes]] as Henry Detmer, who runs the day-to-day operations of Diana's company.<ref name=elwes>{{cite news | url = http://www.deadline.com/2011/03/cary-elwes-joins-nbcs-wonder-woman/ | title = Cary Elwes Joins NBC's 'Wonder Woman' | first = Nellie | last = Andreeva |date = March 4, 2011 | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]] | accessdate = March 4, 2011}}</ref>\n*[[Justin Bruening]] as [[Steve Trevor]], Diana's former boyfriend who works for [[United States Department of Justice|the Justice Department]].<ref name=wonder>{{cite news | url = http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2011/03/wonder-woman-adds-knight-rider-star-as-steve-trevor.html | title = 'Wonder Woman' adds 'Knight Rider' star as Steve Trevor | first = Rick | last = Porter |date = March 25, 2011 | work = Zap2It.com | accessdate = March 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Nancy Grace]] and [[Phil McGraw]] make cameo appearances as themselves.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Adrianne Palicki as Wonder Woman.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Adrianne Palicki]] as Wonder Woman]]\nIn the pilot's first two acts, Wonder Woman wears a new version of her classic comic book uniform: the familiar red top with gold \"W\" insignia chestplate (formerly an eagle symbol chestplate) is still used, as are her golden belt and [[Lasso of Truth]]; but, these are now worn with blue slacks that have gold stars running along the sides, rather than with shorts. Her boots are blue with gold trim (whereas the traditional boots were red and had white, vertical trim). Her bulletproof bracelets/gauntlets are more stylized, and her tiara is much thinner. During the final act of the pilot, when Wonder Woman flies to Cale's hidden laboratory for the final showdown with the villain, her clothing switches from the blue pants, to the more-recognizable shorts.\n\nThough Wonder Woman's [[Lasso of Truth|Magic Golden Lasso]] is referred to as the \"Lasso of Truth\" by a reporter in the episode, she never uses it to magically compel anyone to tell the truth. For instance, in the first act, she uses the Lasso to end a pursuit of a man down city streets at night.  In a later scene, she breaks the arm of one of Cale's henchman to \"make him talk,\" instead of using the Lasso's magic. In this interpretation of Wonder Woman, the Lasso is only employed as an entangling weapon; Wonder Woman snaps it round a target (usually the neck) then jerks it roughly, throwing the target off-balance. Her bracelets can still stop bullets (as in the [[Lynda Carter]]-starring, 1975-1979 TV series).  For example, she uses them to protect herself from a security guard's gunfire during the episode's climax (and retaliates by hurling a steel pipe at the hapless guard, impaling him through the neck and killing him instantly).

Television]] and [[DC Entertainment]] for [[NBC]], based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Wonder Woman|of the same name]]. [[David E. Kelley]] wrote the pilot, which was directed by [[Jeffrey Reiner]]. [[Adrianne Palicki]] starred as the main character.\n\nThe ''Wonder Woman'' pilot was expected to debut in 2011, but NBC opted not to buy the series.\n\n[[Pedro Pascal]], who played Ed Indelicato in the pilot, was later cast in another Wonder Woman's related project, the 2020 movie ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2394822/wonder-woman-2-has-added-a-narcos-star|title=Wonder Woman 2 Has Added A Game Of Thrones Star|website=Cinema Blend|date=March 29, 2018|accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn an inner city home a teenager tells his family that he has been accepted to college moments before he begins convulsing and bleeding from the eyes and ears. Meanwhile, Wonder Woman is in a foot chase with a super-strength criminal on Hollywood Blvd and, after knocking him out, takes a sample of his blood and leaves him to the police. Wonder Woman returns to the headquarters of Themyscira Industries, a large corporation which she runs as the CEO in her alter-ego of Diana Themyscira. Themyscira Industries owns and operates the concept of Wonder Woman as both a privately run crime fighting operation and for marketing the image of Wonder Woman as a role model to the outside world. Diana has trouble balancing her life as both the CEO of the corporation and as Wonder Woman. Diana's frustration with having to maintain a perfect image to the outside world in both these capacities leads her to create a third identity for herself, \"Diana Prince,\" so that she can have an element of normalcy in her life and sit at home with her cat watching romantic comedies and surfing the internet. At Themyscira Industries Diana grows suspicious of evil businesswoman [[Veronica Cale]] for distributing an illegal [[performance-enhancing drug]] that gives users super-human strength and endurance, but can cause death through repeated use.\n\nThe blood sample she draws from the Hollywood Blvd fight and the story of the college-bound teen confirm Diana's suspicions. Without enough hard evidence to bring Cale to justice as Wonder Woman, Diana holds a press conference and airs her beliefs about Cale to the world. Cale in turn confronts Diana in person to intimidate her and threaten legal action. In a flashback, Diana ends up breaking it off with her boyfriend [[Steve Trevor]] because of her busy life. Back in present day, the college-bound teenager dies from his drug sickness and Diana is galvanized to confront Cale as Wonder Woman. She arrives at Cale's facilities, defeats all of her super-powered henchmen and confronts Cale face-to-face. Cale threatens legal action and to release security footage of Wonder Woman killing the henchmen, but Wonder Woman responds by pulling Cale down with her lasso and throwing her against the wall. Later Cale is put in jail and a Justice Department representative comes to meet Diana. This turns out to be Steve Trevor who says that he will be working with Diana in her capacity as Wonder Woman but also reveals that he has married another woman.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n*[[Adrianne Palicki]] as [[Wonder Woman|Diana Prince / Diana Themyscira / Princess Diana of Themyscira / Wonder Woman]], the title role.<ref name=wonder/>\n*[[Elizabeth Hurley]] as [[Veronica Cale]], the villain.<ref name=hurleythoms>{{cite news | url = http://www.deadline.com/2011/03/elizabeth-hurley-joins-nbcs-wonder-woman/ | title = Elizabeth Hurley & Tracie Thoms Join NBC's 'Wonder Woman' | first = Nellie | last = Andreeva |date = March 3, 2011 | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]] | accessdate = March 3, 2011}}</ref>\n*[[Tracie Thoms]] as [[Etta Candy]], Diana's personal assistant.<ref name=hurleythoms/>\n*[[Pedro Pascal]] as Ed Indelicato, Wonder Woman's liaison to the police department.<ref name=pascal>{{cite news | url = http://www.deadline.com/2011/03/the-river-awakening-find-their-leads-two-board-tagged-wonder-woman/ | title = 'The River' & 'Awakening' Find Their Leads, Two Board 'Tagged' & 'Wonder Woman' | first = Nellie | last = Andreeva |date = March 3, 2011 | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]] | accessdate = March 4, 2011}}</ref>\n*[[Cary Elwes]] as Henry Detmer, who runs the day-to-day operations of Diana's company.<ref name=elwes>{{cite news | url = http://www.deadline.com/2011/03/cary-elwes-joins-nbcs-wonder-woman/ | title = Cary Elwes Joins NBC's 'Wonder Woman' | first = Nellie | last = Andreeva |date = March 4, 2011 | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]] | accessdate = March 4, 2011}}</ref>\n*[[Justin Bruening]] as [[Steve Trevor]], Diana's former boyfriend who works for [[United States Department of Justice|the Justice Department]].<ref name=wonder>{{cite news | url = http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2011/03/wonder-woman-adds-knight-rider-star-as-steve-trevor.html | title = 'Wonder Woman' adds 'Knight Rider' star as Steve Trevor | first = Rick | last = Porter |date = March 25, 2011 | work = Zap2It.com | accessdate = March 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Nancy Grace]] and [[Phil McGraw]] make cameo appearances as themselves.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Adrianne Palicki as Wonder Woman.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Adrianne Palicki]] as Wonder Woman]]\nIn the pilot's first two acts, Wonder Woman wears a new version of her classic comic book uniform: the familiar red top with gold \"W\" insignia chestplate (formerly an eagle symbol chestplate) is still used, as are her golden belt and [[Lasso of Truth]]; but, these are now worn with blue slacks that have gold stars running along the sides, rather than with shorts. Her boots are blue with gold trim (whereas the traditional boots were red and had white, vertical trim). Her bulletproof bracelets/gauntlets are more stylized, and her tiara is much thinner. During the final act of the pilot, when Wonder Woman flies to Cale's hidden laboratory for the final showdown with the villain, her clothing switches from the blue pants, to the more-recognizable shorts.\n\nThough Wonder Woman's [[Lasso of Truth|Magic Golden Lasso]] is referred to as the \"Lasso of Truth\" by a reporter in the episode, she never uses it to magically compel anyone to tell the truth. For instance, in the first act, she uses the Lasso to end a pursuit of a man down city streets at night.  In a later scene, she breaks the arm of one of Cale's henchman to \"make him talk,\" instead of using the Lasso's magic. In this interpretation of Wonder Woman, the Lasso is only employed as an entangling weapon; Wonder Woman snaps it round a target (usually the neck) then jerks it roughly, throwing the target off-balance. Her bracelets can still stop bullets (as in the [[Lynda Carter]]-starring, 1975-1979 TV series).  For example, she uses them to protect herself from a security guard's gunfire during the episode's climax (and retaliates by hurling a steel pipe at the hapless guard, impaling him through the neck and killing him instantly). One of this interpretation's greatest departures from WW [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] might be its version of her [[invisible plane]]/\"the Invisible Jet.\"  Here, she gets around Los Angeles in a very small, one-seater aircraft that is reminiscent of a shuttlecraft in a sci-fi space TV show.  While highly sophisticated, the plane is also highly ''visible'' (painted an opaque white).\n\n==Production==\nReports surfaced in October 2010 that [[Warner Bros.]] Television was teaming with writer-producer [[David E.

The record attendance was  40,175 for a league match between Leeds and Bradford Northern on 21 May 1947.\n\n=== General information for those unfamiliar ===\nThe council of the [[Rugby Football League]] voted to introduce a new competition, to be similar to [[The Football Association]] and [[Scottish Football Association]]'s \"League Cup\". It was to be a similar knock-out structure to, and to be secondary to, the Challenge Cup. As this was being formulated, sports sponsorship was becoming more prevalent and as a result John Player and Sons, a division of Imperial Tobacco Company, became sponsors, and the competition never became widely known as the \"League Cup\" <br />\nThe competition ran from 1971-72 until 1995\u201396 and was initially intended for the professional clubs plus the two amateur [[British Amateur Rugby League Association|BARLA]] National Cup finalists. In later seasons the entries were expanded to take in other amateur and French teams. The competition was dropped due to \"fixture congestion\" when Rugby League became a summer sport\nThe Rugby League season always (until the onset of \"Summer Rugby\" in 1996) ran from around August-time through to around May-time and this competition always took place early in the season, in the Autumn, with the final usually taking place in late January <br />\nThe competition was variably known, by its sponsorship name, as the Player's No.6 Trophy (1971\u20131977), the John Player Trophy (1977\u20131983), the John Player Special Trophy (1983\u20131989), and the Regal Trophy in 1989.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[1989\u201390 Rugby Football League season]]\n*[[1989 Lancashire Cup]]\n*[[1989 Yorkshire Cup]]\n*[[League Cup (rugby league)|Regal Trophy]]\n*[[Rugby league county cups]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.saints.org.uk/saints.org.uk/home/viewpage.php?page_id=9 Saints Heritage Society]\n*[http://wigan.rlfans.com/fusion_pages/index.php?page_id=319 1896\u201397 Northern Rugby Football Union season at wigan.rlfans.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302024838/http://www.hullfc.com/FixturesAndResults.aspx?sg=12&gi=3 Hull&Proud Fixtures & Results 1896/1897]\n*[http://www.rugby.widnes.tv/seasonreview.php?mid=1896&smid=1896-97&mids=1896 Widnes Vikings - One team, one passion Season In Review - 1896\u201397]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080828182311/http://www.warringtonwolves.org/HistoryB.ink The Northern Union at warringtonwolves.org]\n*[http://www.huddersfieldrlheritage.co.uk/Archive/Written/Players'%20Records.html Huddersfield R L Heritage]\n*[http://www.wakefieldtrinity-programmes.co.uk/page_2654162.html Wakefield until I die]\n{{1990 in rugby league}}\n{{League Cup (rugby league)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1989-90 Regal Trophy}}\n[[Category:1989 in English rugby league]]\n[[Category:1990 in English rugby league]]\n[[Category:League Cup (rugby league)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox rugby football league season\n| title               = 1989\u201390 League Cup\n| logo           = Regal trophy logo.PNG\n| pixels         = 200px | alt = Regal Trophy logo\n| structure              = National knockout championship\n| season_champs       = [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]]\n| season_champ_name   = Winners\n| runner-up_name = Runner-up\n| second_place = [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]]\n| prevseason_link     = 1988\u201389 League Cup (rugby league)\n| prevseason_year     = 1988\u201389\n| nextseason_link     = 1990\u201391 League Cup (rugby league)\n| nextseason_year     = 1990\u201391\n| no_of_teams         = 38\n}}\n\nThis was the nineteenth season for the [[League Cup (rugby league)|competition]], known from this season onwards as the '''Regal Trophy''' for sponsorship reasons.\n\n[[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] won the final, beating [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]] by the score of 24-12 in the match was played at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]], [[Leeds]].

It was to be a similar knock-out structure to, and to be secondary to, the Challenge Cup. As this was being formulated, sports sponsorship was becoming more prevalent and as a result John Player and Sons, a division of Imperial Tobacco Company, became sponsors, and the competition never became widely known as the \"League Cup\" <br />\nThe competition ran from 1971-72 until 1995\u201396 and was initially intended for the professional clubs plus the two amateur [[British Amateur Rugby League Association|BARLA]] National Cup finalists. In later seasons the entries were expanded to take in other amateur and French teams. The competition was dropped due to \"fixture congestion\" when Rugby League became a summer sport\nThe Rugby League season always (until the onset of \"Summer Rugby\" in 1996) ran from around August-time through to around May-time and this competition always took place early in the season, in the Autumn, with the final usually taking place in late January <br />\nThe competition was variably known, by its sponsorship name, as the Player's No.6 Trophy (1971\u20131977), the John Player Trophy (1977\u20131983), the John Player Special Trophy (1983\u20131989), and the Regal Trophy in 1989.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[1989\u201390 Rugby Football League season]]\n*[[1989 Lancashire Cup]]\n*[[1989 Yorkshire Cup]]\n*[[League Cup (rugby league)|Regal Trophy]]\n*[[Rugby league county cups]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.saints.org.uk/saints.org.uk/home/viewpage.php?page_id=9 Saints Heritage Society]\n*[http://wigan.rlfans.com/fusion_pages/index.php?page_id=319 1896\u201397 Northern Rugby Football Union season at wigan.rlfans.com]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302024838/http://www.hullfc.com/FixturesAndResults.aspx?sg=12&gi=3 Hull&Proud Fixtures & Results 1896/1897]\n*[http://www.rugby.widnes.tv/seasonreview.php?mid=1896&smid=1896-97&mids=1896 Widnes Vikings - One team, one passion Season In Review - 1896\u201397]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080828182311/http://www.warringtonwolves.org/HistoryB.ink The Northern Union at warringtonwolves.org]\n*[http://www.huddersfieldrlheritage.co.uk/Archive/Written/Players'%20Records.html Huddersfield R L Heritage]\n*[http://www.wakefieldtrinity-programmes.co.uk/page_2654162.html Wakefield until I die]\n{{1990 in rugby league}}\n{{League Cup (rugby league)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1989-90 Regal Trophy}}\n[[Category:1989 in English rugby league]]\n[[Category:1990 in English rugby league]]\n[[Category:League Cup (rugby league)]]\n", "name_user": "Jonesey95", "label": "safe", "comment": "FixLintererrors", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989%E2%80%9390_League_Cup_(rugby_league)"}

The first major step government agencies placed on restricting cigarette smoking came from the first Surgeon General's Report in 1964 which established cigarette smoking causing increased mortality.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://betobaccofree.hhs.gov/laws/|title=Laws/Policies|last=ASPA|date=2012-08-08|website=betobaccofree.hhs.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-03}}</ref> The year following the release of this report, the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act was passed requiring a health warning on all cigarette packages.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/tobacco_industry/reporting/descriptions/index.htm|title=CDC - Tobacco Industry and Products - Description of the Laws - Smoking & Tobacco Use|last=Health|first=CDC's Office on Smoking and|date=2017-11-13|website=Smoking and Tobacco Use|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-03}}</ref> The next major act passed in 1970 was the [[Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act]] that banned radio and television cigarettes advertisements.<ref name=\":4\" /> Nearly 15 years later in 1984, the [[Comprehensive Smoking Education Act]] was passed requiring the health labels on cigarette packages to rotate between four different health warning labels.<ref name=\":4\" /> Then in 1986, the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act was passed further reinforcing the rules in place by the prior acts.<ref name=\":5\" /> The acts passed between 1965 and 1985 primarily aimed to make the public more aware of the health hazards associated with cigarette smoking.\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, acts passed by Congress were oriented around limiting cigarette use and access in public settings. In 1988 an amendment was made to the [[Federal Aviation Act of 1958|Federal Aviation Act]] making domestic flights of less than two hours smoke-free,<ref name=\":4\" /> which was later supported by the [[Wendell H.

The stages can progress in any direction and stop or restart any number of times.\n\n<u>Stage 1</u>: Pre-contemplation/preparation<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal | last1 = Mayhew | first1 = K.

Adolescents in this stage are likely impervious to the effects of social pressures for smoking or do not view smoking in a positive light.\n\n<u>Stage 2</u>: Contemplation/Preparation<ref name=\":6\" /> \u2013 An adolescent's beliefs about smoking are beginning to change as they begin to contemplate smoking. Youth will often develop attitudes or envision what smoking will be like before engaging initiating. Notably, these attitudes towards smoking may often be negative, but are not as salient nor impactful to the adolescent because of either positive media messages or role models (i.e. parents who are smokers). Adolescents in this stage begin to consider the function of smoking, with popular reasons including smoking to be cool or independent, reduce social anxiety, and regulate emotions.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leventhal | first1 = H. | last2 = Cleary | first2 = P.

Typically, there are stronger peer or familial influences motivating this initial behavior. Adolescents may also desire to improve their self-image if they are receiving minimal approval from their desired peers further increasing the chances of initiation.\n\n<u>Stage 4</u>: Experimentation<ref name=\":6\" /> \u2013 During this stage, there is a steady increase in the frequency of cigarette use, as well as the various situations in which cigarettes are used. There is an imbalance between positive and negative values placed on cigarettes, such that an adolescent adopts increasingly positive views on cigarette smoking. An adolescent smoker in this stage is not guaranteed to be a regular smoker and still has the option of quitting. Among smokers in this category who are likely to become regular smokers, the negative aspects of smoking such as the burning sensation or heat are reduced, and more positive benefits are emphasized. While there can be acute initial positive effects from smoking (i.e. increased [[heart rate]] and [[nervous system]] stimulation), smoking during this and the subsequent stage may be associated with some of the more severe physiological consequences of smoking. Additionally, youth in this stage may begin to associate themselves with a personal identity of being a smoker as they are learning how to smoke (i.e. how to handle a cigarette, inhale correctly, etc.).\n\n<u>Stage 5</u>: Regular Smoking<ref name=\":6\" /> \u2013 Smoking throughout this stage becomes less infrequent and more regular. Regular smoking in youth can vary from smoking at social gatherings or smoking on a majority of weekdays. Adolescents in this category are not characterized as smoking daily or in high rates.\n\n<u>Stage 6</u>: Established/Daily Smoking<ref name=\":6\" />  \u2013 Not all adolescent smokers from the previous stage move to this stage, although a large proportion do progress to daily smoking. Adolescent smokers in this stage may begin to experience symptoms associated with nicotine dependence such as strong cravings or withdrawal symptoms. At this point, a combination of physiological and biological factors maintains the smoking behavior as part of the adolescent's [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]].\n\nPrevious research has examined the differential effects various influences can have at different stages of smoking.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lloyd-Richardson | first1 = E.

An additional major risk factor is alcohol use, which has been demonstrated as being more influential during the earlier stages of smoking.

Adolescents in this stage are likely impervious to the effects of social pressures for smoking or do not view smoking in a positive light.\n\n<u>Stage 2</u>: Contemplation/Preparation<ref name=\":6\" /> \u2013 An adolescent's beliefs about smoking are beginning to change as they begin to contemplate smoking. Youth will often develop attitudes or envision what smoking will be like before engaging initiating. Notably, these attitudes towards smoking may often be negative, but are not as salient nor impactful to the adolescent because of either positive media messages or role models (i.e. parents who are smokers). Adolescents in this stage begin to consider the function of smoking, with popular reasons including smoking to be cool or independent, reduce social anxiety, and regulate emotions.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Leventhal | first1 = H. | last2 = Cleary | first2 = P.

Typically, there are stronger peer or familial influences motivating this initial behavior. Adolescents may also desire to improve their self-image if they are receiving minimal approval from their desired peers further increasing the chances of initiation.\n\n<u>Stage 4</u>: Experimentation<ref name=\":6\" /> \u2013 During this stage, there is a steady increase in the frequency of cigarette use, as well as the various situations in which cigarettes are used. There is an imbalance between positive and negative values placed on cigarettes, such that an adolescent adopts increasingly positive views on cigarette smoking. An adolescent smoker in this stage is not guaranteed to be a regular smoker and still has the option of quitting. Among smokers in this category who are likely to become regular smokers, the negative aspects of smoking such as the burning sensation or heat are reduced, and more positive benefits are emphasized. While there can be acute initial positive effects from smoking (i.e. increased [[heart rate]] and [[nervous system]] stimulation), smoking during this and the subsequent stage may be associated with some of the more severe physiological consequences of smoking. Additionally, youth in this stage may begin to associate themselves with a personal identity of being a smoker as they are learning how to smoke (i.e. how to handle a cigarette, inhale correctly, etc.).\n\n<u>Stage 5</u>: Regular Smoking<ref name=\":6\" /> \u2013 Smoking throughout this stage becomes less infrequent and more regular. Regular smoking in youth can vary from smoking at social gatherings or smoking on a majority of weekdays. Adolescents in this category are not characterized as smoking daily or in high rates.\n\n<u>Stage 6</u>: Established/Daily Smoking<ref name=\":6\" />  \u2013 Not all adolescent smokers from the previous stage move to this stage, although a large proportion do progress to daily smoking.

[[Snus]] use among adolescent groups has worried many leading public health officials. Snus may aid youth in cessation of smoking or in harm reduction, but it can also be used in conjunction with cigarettes and thus increase risk for disease. While snus is often advertised as having less harm than cigarettes, the most significant health effects snus can have include maintaining dependence to cigarettes and using snus as an initial tobacco product before trying other tobacco products.<ref name=\":23\">McMillen, R., Maduka, J., & Winickoff, J.

They are one of the newest tobacco products currently being tested on the market is Camel's Orbs. Orbs are [[dissolvable tobacco]] pills that come in a variety of flavors such as cinnamon or citrus that resemble breath mints.
