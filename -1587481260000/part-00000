From 2021, students will be divided into G1, G2 and G3, according to the Subject-Based Banding scheme. Singaporeans are forbidden to attend international schools on the island without Ministry of Education permission.\n\n\"Special\" and \"Express\" are four-year courses leading up to the [[GCE Ordinary Level in Singapore|Singapore-Cambridge GCE \"O\" Level]] examination. The difference between these two courses is that in the \"Special\" stream, students take 'Higher Mother Tongue' (available for Standard Mandarin, Malay and Tamil only) instead of 'Mother Tongue'. A pass in the Higher Mother Tongue 'O' Level Examination constitutes the fulfilment of the Mother Tongue requirement in Singapore, whereas Normal Mother Tongue Students will have to go through one more year of study in their Mother Tongue after their 'O' Levels to take the 'A' Level H1 Mother Tongue Examinations and fulfil the MOE's requirement. A foreign language, either French, German, Japanese or Spanish can be taken in addition to the mother tongue or can replace it. This is especially popular with students who are struggling with their mother tongues, expatriates, or students returning from abroad. Non-Chinese students may also study Standard Mandarin and non-Malay students Malay as a third language. This programme is known as CSP (Chinese Special Programme) and MSP (Malay Special Programme).

Normal is split into ''Normal (Academic)'' and ''Normal (Technical)''. Normal (Academic) course are geared towards preparing students for the O-level exam in the fifth year, subject to good performance in the N-level exam in the fourth year, and students take academic subjects such as Principles of Accounting. In Normal (Technical), students take subjects of a more technical nature, such as Design and Technology, and they generally proceed to the [[Institute of Technical Education]] (ITE) after the N-level exam in the fourth year. In 2004, the Ministry of Education announced that selected students in the Normal course would have an opportunity to sit for the O-level exam directly without first taking the N-level exam.\n\nWith the exception of schools offering the Integrated Programme, which leads to either an [[IB Diploma Programme|International Baccalaureate Diploma]] or to an [[General Certificate of Education|A-level]] exam, most students are streamed into a wide range of course combinations at the end of their second year, bringing the total number of subjects they have to sit at O-level to between six and ten, with English, Mother Tongue or Higher Mother Tongue Language, Mathematics, one Science and one Humanities Elective being compulsory.

There are many CCAs offered at the secondary school level, however, different schools may choose to offer different CCAs. Students may choose to participate in more than 1 CCA.\n\nParticipation in CCAs is graded together with other non-academic achievements throughout a student's secondary school education in a scoring system known as LEAPS 2.0.

By bypassing the GCE \"O\" level examinations, students are given more time and flexibility to immerse themselves in a more broadly-based education. In addition, students enjoy more freedom in the combination of subjects between Year 1 \u2013 4 as compared to their non-IP counterparts. Generally, only the top performers (usually from Special, and sometimes Express, stream) are eligible to be part of the IP programme. This will ensure that the main body of the students pursue their secondary education at their own pace by first completing a 4-year \"O\" level course before going on to a 2-year \"A\" level education.\n\nAs a result, schools with an IP allow their students to skip the \"O\" levels at Secondary 4 and go straight into junior colleges (JCs) in Year 5/JC1. The [[Integrated Programme]] with the revised Singapore-Cambridge GCE \"A\" levels or the [[International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme|IB Diploma]] as a terminal qualification has become an increasingly popular alternative to the standard secondary education pathway. This is because it is perceived as having moved away from the usually heavy emphasis on the sciences, a phenomenon resulting from the post-independence need for quick and basic technical and industrial education; to subjects in the arts and humanities. Such programmes are more project-based and students are expected to be independent learners.\n\nThe first batch of IP students sat for the revised GCE \"A\" Level or International Baccalaureate Diploma examinations in 2007.\n\n=== Specialised Independent Schools (SIS) ===\nSpecialised Independent Schools offer specialised education with different focuses. There are currently four specialised schools in Singapore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://beta.moe.gov.sg/schools/types/|title=School type {{!}} Ministry of Education|website=beta.moe.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=23 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n* [[NUS High School of Math and Science|NUS High School of Mathematics and Science]], focuses on Mathematics, Science, Technology and Engineering.\n* [[School of Science and Technology, Singapore]], focuses on applied learning in Science, Technology, Aesthetics, Engineering and Mathematics.\n* [[School of the Arts, Singapore]], focuses on Visual, Literary and Performing Arts.\n* [[Singapore Sports School]]s, focuses on Sports and Athletics.\n\n===Admission to post-secondary institutions===\nUpon completion of the 4- or 5-year secondary school education, students (excluding IP students) will participate in the annual [[Singaporean GCE 'O' Level]], the results of which determine which pre-universities or post-secondary institutions they may apply for. Pre-university centres include junior colleges for a two-year course leading up to [[GCE 'A' Level]], or the Millennia Institute for a three-year course leading up to [[GCE 'A' Level]]. Junior colleges and the Millennia Institute accept students on merit, with a greater emphasis on academics than vocational technical education. Students who wish to pursue specialised education go on to pre-universities institutions such as the polytechnics or arts institutions where they receive a diploma upon successful completion of their courses.\n\nAdmission to a two-year pre-university course at junior colleges after graduating from secondary school is determined by the L1R5 (English + 5 relevant subjects) scoring system. This scoring system is based on the 'O' Level subject grades, which range from A1 (best) to F9 (worst). The candidate adds the numerical grades for six different subjects: English (or another language taken at the 'first language' level), a Humanities subject, a Science/Mathematics subject, a Humanities/Science/Mathematics subject, and two other subjects of any kind. The best L1R5 unmodified score is therefore 6, for a student with A1 grades in six subjects which meet the criteria.\n\nStudents scoring 20 points and below may be admitted for either a Science or Arts Course. In addition, a student must also achieve at least a C6 grade, which is 50% or higher, in the GCE 'O' Level English Language and Mathematics papers to qualify for junior college admission. Pre-university centres that are particularly associated with academic excellence, however, usually expect students to attain points in the single digits, to be admitted. This is because the system is merit-driven, with places given to those with lower scores first.\n\nFor admission to a three-year pre-university course at the Millennia Institute, the L1R4 (English + 4 relevant subjects) scoring system is used, and students are expected to score below 20 points to be admitted. Students may opt for any of the science, arts or commerce streams when pursuing a three-year pre-university course.\n\n==Pre-university and post-secondary studies==\nThe pre-university centres of Singapore such as Junior Colleges and Centralized institute are designed for students who wish to pursue a local university degree after two to three years of pre-university education. Alternatively, polytechnics and arts institutions in Singapore prepare students for both workforce and university studies.\n\nThere are 19 [[Junior college (Singapore)|Junior Colleges]] (JCs) and a Centralised Institute (CI), the [[Millennia Institute]] (MI, established 2004), with the [[National Junior College]] (NJC, established 1969) being the oldest and Eunoia Junior College (EJC, established 2017) the newest.\n\nBesides junior colleges, most graduates of polytechnics and arts institutions continue to pursue further tertiary education at overseas and local universities. Those with good grades are given exemptions for university modules completed in Polytechnic, notably universities in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\n\n===Junior college===\n{{Main|Junior college (Singapore)}}\nJunior colleges (JCs) in Singapore were initially designed to offer an accelerated alternative to the traditional three-year programme, but the two-year programme has since become the norm for students pursuing university education.\n\nJCs accept students based on their GCE \"O\" Level results; an L1R5 score of 20 points or less must be attained for a student to gain admission. JCs provide a 2-year course leading up to the [[Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level]] (\"A\" level) examination. The CI accepts students based on their GCE \"O\" Level results; an L1R4 score of 20 points or less must be attained for a student to gain admission. The MI provides a 3-year course leading up to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level (\"A\" level) examination.\n\nAll students are required to participate in at least one CCA (Co-Curricular Activities) as CCA performance is considered for university admission.<ref name=\"pre-u\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.sg/education/pre-u/ |title=Pre-University Education |work=Ministry of Education, Singapore |accessdate=16 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623164927/http://www.moe.gov.sg/education/pre-u/ |archivedate=23 June 2011  }}</ref>\n\n===Centralised Institute===\n{{Main|Centralised institutes (Singapore)}}\nThe Centralised Institutes accept students based on their GCE \"O\" level results and their L1R4 score (which must be 20 points or below). A Centralised Institute provides a three-year course leading up to a GCE \"A\" level examination. There were originally four Centralized Institutes: [[Outram Institute]], [[Townsville Institute]], [[Jurong Institute]] and [[Seletar Institute]]. [[Townsville Institute]] and [[Seletar Institute]] stopped accepting new students after the 1995 school year and closed down after the last batch of students graduated in 1997.\n\nThere currently remains only one Centralised Institute in Singapore, the [[Millennia Institute]], which was formed following the merger of Jurong and Outram Institutes. Additionally, only Centralised Institutes offer the Commerce Stream offering subjects such as Principles of Accounting and Management of Business. The standard of teaching and curriculum is identical to that of the Junior Colleges.\n\n===Polytechnics and Arts institutions===\n[[File:Temasek Polytechnic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Temasek Polytechnic, third polytechnic established in Singapore]]\nThe first polytechnic in Singapore, [[Singapore Polytechnic]], was established in 1954.<ref name=\"worldbank\">{{cite news|title=Singapore's Education System: 1820s \u2013 1945|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTAFRREGTOPEDUCATION/Resources/444659-1204656846740/4734984-1212686310562/Toward_a_better_future_Singapore.pdf |accessdate=29 November 2012 |publisher=National Library Board Singapore }}</ref> [[Ngee Ann Polytechnic]], has roots that go back to 1963.<ref name=\"worldbank\" /> Two other polytechnics, [[Temasek Polytechnic]] and [[Nanyang Polytechnic]] were established in the 1990s.<ref name=\"worldbank\" /> The most recent, [[Republic Polytechnic]] was established in 2003.<ref name=\"worldbank\" /> The two Arts Institutions, [[Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts]] and [[LASALLE College of the Arts]], started off as fully private educational providers but eventually were absorbed by the Ministry of Education before becoming autonomous, operating under private management with government fundings.\n\nPolytechnics and arts institutions in Singapore provide 3-year diploma courses. They accept students based on their GCE \"O\" level, GCE \"A\" level or Institute of Technical Education (ITE) results.\n\nPolytechnics offer a wide range of courses in various fields, including engineering, business studies, [[accountancy]], tourism and hospitality management, mass [[Communication studies|communications]], digital media and [[biotechnology]]. There are also specialised courses such as marine engineering, nautical studies, [[nursing]], and [[optometry]]. They provide a more industry-oriented education as an alternative to junior colleges for post-secondary studies. About 40% of each Secondary 4 cohort would enroll in Polytechnics.<ref name=\"moe19980214\">{{cite news |title=The Desired Outcomes of Education |url=http://www.moe.gov.sg/speeches/1998/140298.htm |accessdate=29 November 2012 |publisher=Ministry of Education, Singapore |date=14 February 1998 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205065120/http://www.moe.gov.sg/speeches/1998/140298.htm |archive-date=5 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Notable alumni from Polytechnics in Singapore include former [[National University of Singapore|NUS]] President Dr [[Shih Choon Fong]] and CEO of [[Creative Technology]] [[Sim Wong Hoo]].\n\nThe two arts institutions have a similar approach as Polytechnics but focus only on the comprehensive Arts and Design education.\n\n==Vocational education==\nInitially, vocational education in Singapore carried a negative stigma and was looked down upon as a dead-end option for underachieving students. In the 1960s, it was considered less than socially desirable educational option as vocational education was perceived that these schools were for low achieving students. Societal prejudice against less academically inclined students and vocational educational was regarded low quality and typically out of step with the changing needs of employers.<ref name=\"Stewart\">{{Cite news |url=http://asiasociety.org/global-cities-education-network/singapore-innovation-technical-education |title=Singapore: Innovation in Technical Education |last=Stewart |first=Vivien |date=7 March 2016}}</ref> The perception of technical and vocational education in Singapore are slowly changing as parents are starting to realize that there are alternative choices for decent employment outcomes as the greater Singaporean society values vocational and technical skills highly and sees them as crucial to the country's economic development.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/pursuing-a-vocational/2246520.html |title=Pursuing a vocational track \u2013 an alternative pathway to success |last=Abdul Khamid |first=Hetty Musfirah  |date=8 November 2015}}</ref> Vocational education has been an important part of Singapore's unique economic planning since 1992, where it began to transform and change the perception of vocational education and decided to transform and preposition it so that it was not seen as a place of last resort for underachieving pupils.

There are [[Institute of Technical Education#Colleges|three ITE colleges]] in Singapore. Only a few ITE graduates will be able to continue their education at polytechnics and arts institutions which then, if possible goes on to a university. ITE colleges offer apprenticeships for the skilled trades and diplomas in vocational education for skilled technicians and workers in support roles in professions such as engineering, accountancy, business administration, nursing, medicine, architecture, and law. The ITE is highly recognized vocational institution in producing highly skilled graduates that are in demand by employers. Salaries for ITE graduates, who receive a National ITE Certificate (NITEC) or a diploma have also become quite high. ITE provides apprenticeships, professional certificates, licenses and diplomas in business administration, accountancy, woodworking, metalworking, carpentry, drafting, shipbuilding and repairing, transportation and engineering science.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED019488.pdf|title=OUTLINE OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING IN SINGAPORE}}</ref> As of 2014, 87% of ITE graduates are hired in their fields within six months of graduation, leading more students to see vocational education as a strong alternative besides the traditional route of going to university.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ncee.org/what-we-do/center-on-international-education-benchmarking/top-performing-countries/singapore-overview/singapore-school-to-work|title=Singapore}}</ref><ref name=\"Stewart\"/>\n\nITE provides four main levels of certification:\n* Master National ITE Certificate (Master Nitec)\n* Higher National ITE Certificate (Higher Nitec)\n* National ITE Certificate (Nitec)\n* Work Learn Technical Diploma (WLTD) (From 2017)\n* Specialist Nitec (Marine) \n* Technical Engineer Diploma (TED) (from 2007)<ref>{{cite news|title=ITE to roll out first diploma programme|url=http://business.asiaone.com/Business/News/Office/Story/A1Story20070725-19723.html|accessdate=19 December 2012|publisher=AsiaOne, Singapore | date=25 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nThere are also other skills certification through part-time apprenticeship courses conducted jointly by ITE and industrial companies.

International and private schools in Singapore generally do not admit Singapore students without permission from the Ministry of Education.\n\nHowever, on 29 April 2004 the Ministry of Education permitted three new international schools to be set up without permission being needed to admit Singapore students. These schools must follow the compulsory policies set by the Ministry such as playing the [[Majulah Singapura|national anthem]] and taking the pledge every morning, as well as following the nation's policies on bilingualism. These schools \u2013 [[Anglo-Chinese School (International) Singapore|Anglo-Chinese School (International)]], [[Hwa Chong International School]] and [[SJI International School]] \u2013 are private schools run by the boards of other locally renowned institutions. The school fees are 15 to 20 percent lower than those of foreign international schools. Their intake includes students from countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], People's Republic of China, Taiwan, [[South Korea]], [[Philippines]], [[Vietnam]], [[Netherlands]], and the United Kingdom.\n\nEstablished under the Private Education Act, the [[Committee for Private Education]] (CPE, also formerly the Council for Private Education) is a statutory board empowered with the legislative power to regulate the private education sector.  In addition to its role as the sectoral regulator of private education institutions, the CPE facilitates capability development efforts to uplift standards in the local private education industry.\n\nOn 20 May 2010, the CPE has registered the first batch of private education institutions (PEIs) under the Enhanced Registration Framework (ERF). Following the launch of the new private education regulatory regime on 21 December 2009, all PEIs within the regulatory scope of the Private Education Act are required to register with the CPE under the ERF. Under the Enhanced Registration Framework, private institutions must meet requirements relating to their managers, teachers, courses and examination boards. Out of 308 which applied, less than a third were given the stamp of approval and students are relieved that their school has made the mark. Only 63 ERF applications have been evaluated by the CPE, of which 36 PEIs like [[Management Development Institute of Singapore|MDIS]], EASB, SDH Institute, SAA Global Education, Coleman College, STEi Institute etc. have been registered for a period of four years ERF, and 26 PEIs have been registered for one year.

While English is the first language and the medium of instruction in schools, most students are required to take a \"Mother Tongue\" subject, which could be one of the three official languages: Standard Mandarin, Malay or Tamil. A non-Tamil Indian may choose to offer Tamil or a non-official language such as [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] or [[Urdu]]. However, Chinese students from a non-Mandarin background, such as Cantonese speakers, must learn Mandarin, and students with Indonesian background must learn Malay. Non-Chinese, Malay or Indian students may choose to learn either one of these languages (Usually the Japanese, Koreans and Southeast Asians who are not from Malay or Indonesian origin will choose Chinese). Mother Tongue is a compulsory examinable subject at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and the GCE \"N\", \"O\" and \"A\" level examinations. Students are required to achieve a certain level of proficiency in what the government considers their mother tongue as a pre-requisite for admission to local universities.

Education Language Centre]].]]\n\nBased on results of the [[PSLE]], students are placed in different secondary education tracks or streams: \"Express\", \"Normal (Academic)\", or \"Normal (Technical)\" till 2020. From 2021, students will be divided into G1, G2 and G3, according to the Subject-Based Banding scheme. Singaporeans are forbidden to attend international schools on the island without Ministry of Education permission.\n\n\"Special\" and \"Express\" are four-year courses leading up to the [[GCE Ordinary Level in Singapore|Singapore-Cambridge GCE \"O\" Level]] examination. The difference between these two courses is that in the \"Special\" stream, students take 'Higher Mother Tongue' (available for Standard Mandarin, Malay and Tamil only) instead of 'Mother Tongue'. A pass in the Higher Mother Tongue 'O' Level Examination constitutes the fulfilment of the Mother Tongue requirement in Singapore, whereas Normal Mother Tongue Students will have to go through one more year of study in their Mother Tongue after their 'O' Levels to take the 'A' Level H1 Mother Tongue Examinations and fulfil the MOE's requirement. A foreign language, either French, German, Japanese or Spanish can be taken in addition to the mother tongue or can replace it. This is especially popular with students who are struggling with their mother tongues, expatriates, or students returning from abroad. Non-Chinese students may also study Standard Mandarin and non-Malay students Malay as a third language. This programme is known as CSP (Chinese Special Programme) and MSP (Malay Special Programme). Mother Tongue teachers conduct these lessons in school after usual hours. Students of Higher Mother Tongue languages are allowed to have up to two points taken off their O-level scoring, unless the student's Higher Mother Tongue is used as their L1 in computation of L1R5.<ref>{{cite web|title=Benefits of studying a third language|url=http://www.moe.gov.sg/moelc/benefits.htm|accessdate=8 May 2006|publisher=[[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060212093522/http://www.moe.gov.sg/moelc/benefits.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 12 February 2006}}</ref> a scoring system discussed below where a lower value is considered better, if they meet set benchmarks. The [[Ministry of Education Language Centre]] (MOELC) provides free language education for most additional languages that other schools may not cover, and provides the bulk of such education, admitting several thousand students each year.\n\n''Normal'' is a four-year course leading up to the [[General Certificate of Education|Normal-level]] (N-level) exam, with the possibility of a fifth year leading up to the GCE O-level exam. Normal is split into ''Normal (Academic)'' and ''Normal (Technical)''. Normal (Academic) course are geared towards preparing students for the O-level exam in the fifth year, subject to good performance in the N-level exam in the fourth year, and students take academic subjects such as Principles of Accounting. In Normal (Technical), students take subjects of a more technical nature, such as Design and Technology, and they generally proceed to the [[Institute of Technical Education]] (ITE) after the N-level exam in the fourth year. In 2004, the Ministry of Education announced that selected students in the Normal course would have an opportunity to sit for the O-level exam directly without first taking the N-level exam.\n\nWith the exception of schools offering the Integrated Programme, which leads to either an [[IB Diploma Programme|International Baccalaureate Diploma]] or to an [[General Certificate of Education|A-level]] exam, most students are streamed into a wide range of course combinations at the end of their second year, bringing the total number of subjects they have to sit at O-level to between six and ten, with English, Mother Tongue or Higher Mother Tongue Language, Mathematics, one Science and one Humanities Elective being compulsory. Several new subjects such as Computing and Theatre Studies and Drama are being introduced in tandem with the Ministry of Education's revised curriculum.\n\n===Co-Curricular activities===\n{{main|Co-curricular activity (Singapore)}}\nParticipating in a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) is mandatory at the primary and secondary levels, meaning that all pupils must participate in at least one activity. CCAs offered at the secondary level are usually categorised as Uniformed Groups, Performing Arts, Clubs & Societies and Sports & Games Competitions. There are many CCAs offered at the secondary school level, however, different schools may choose to offer different CCAs. Students may choose to participate in more than 1 CCA.\n\nParticipation in CCAs is graded together with other non-academic achievements throughout a student's secondary school education in a scoring system known as LEAPS 2.0. (LEAPS 1.0 was abolished and the cohort of 2016 taking the 'O' level examination would be last to use this system).<ref name=\"cca\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2003/pr20030111a.htm |title=CCA Guidelines and Grading Scheme for Secondary Schools Revised |accessdate=16 November 2012 |work=Ministry of Education Singapore |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207165926/http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2003/pr20030111a.htm |archive-date=7 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{efn|LEAPS is an acronym for '''L'''eadership, '''E'''nrichment, '''A'''chievement, '''P'''articipation, '''S'''ervice<ref name=\"cca\" />}} Points accumulated in the areas of leadership, enrichment, achievement, participation and service will determine a student's CCA grade.<ref name=\"cca\" /> Students may get up to a maximum of two bonus points for entry into a junior college depending on their CCA grades.<ref name=\"asiaone20100325\">{{cite web |url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20100325-206604.html |title=Review bonus-point criteria for admission to junior colleges |accessdate=23 November 2012|work= [[My Paper]]| publisher= AsiaOne| date=25 March 2010}}</ref>\nLEAPS 2.0 is about leadership, achievement, participation and service.

It allows students to undertake [[English language|English Language]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese Language]] at first language standard in the Special academic stream (a modified variation of the Express academic stream, assimilated into the Express academic stream in 2006), with a widened exposure to the Chinese culture and values. The programme is offered in designated schools that are recognised for its preservation of strong Chinese cultural heritage and academic excellence.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2008/02/enhanced-programmes-by-special.php|title=Ministry of Education, Singapore: Press Releases|website=www.moe.gov.sg|accessdate=11 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102105332/http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/press/2008/02/enhanced-programmes-by-special.php|archivedate=2 January 2013}}</ref> Currently, there are a total of 15 primary schools and 11 high schools being accorded SAP status.\n\nIn the initial years, student must achieve a PSLE aggregate score that puts him in the top 10% of his cohort, with an 'A' grade for both the mother tongue and English, in order to be entitled to enter an SAP school under the Special academic stream, before the educational reforms in the 2000s. Currently, students are entitled to additional bonus points when applying for SAP high schools with their [[Primary School Leaving Examination]] (PSLE) results.\n\n===Integrated Programme===\n{{Main|Integrated Programme}}\n\n[[File:Hwa Chong Institution Clock Tower Front View.JPG|right|thumb|300px|[[Hwa Chong Institution]] was one of the first four schools in Singapore to offer an Integrated Programme.]]\n\nThe Integrated Programme, also known as the \"Through-Train Programme\" (\u76f4\u901a\u8f66), is a scheme which allows the most able secondary students in Singapore to bypass \"O\" levels and take \"A\" levels, [[International Baccalaureate]] or an equivalent examination directly at the age of 18 after six years of secondary education.\n\nThe programme allows for more time to be allocated to enrichment activities. By bypassing the GCE \"O\" level examinations, students are given more time and flexibility to immerse themselves in a more broadly-based education. In addition, students enjoy more freedom in the combination of subjects between Year 1 \u2013 4 as compared to their non-IP counterparts. Generally, only the top performers (usually from Special, and sometimes Express, stream) are eligible to be part of the IP programme. This will ensure that the main body of the students pursue their secondary education at their own pace by first completing a 4-year \"O\" level course before going on to a 2-year \"A\" level education.\n\nAs a result, schools with an IP allow their students to skip the \"O\" levels at Secondary 4 and go straight into junior colleges (JCs) in Year 5/JC1. The [[Integrated Programme]] with the revised Singapore-Cambridge GCE \"A\" levels or the [[International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme|IB Diploma]] as a terminal qualification has become an increasingly popular alternative to the standard secondary education pathway. This is because it is perceived as having moved away from the usually heavy emphasis on the sciences, a phenomenon resulting from the post-independence need for quick and basic technical and industrial education; to subjects in the arts and humanities. Such programmes are more project-based and students are expected to be independent learners.\n\nThe first batch of IP students sat for the revised GCE \"A\" Level or International Baccalaureate Diploma examinations in 2007.\n\n=== Specialised Independent Schools (SIS) ===\nSpecialised Independent Schools offer specialised education with different focuses. There are currently four specialised schools in Singapore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://beta.moe.gov.sg/schools/types/|title=School type {{!}} Ministry of Education|website=beta.moe.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=23 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n* [[NUS High School of Math and Science|NUS High School of Mathematics and Science]], focuses on Mathematics, Science, Technology and Engineering.\n* [[School of Science and Technology, Singapore]], focuses on applied learning in Science, Technology, Aesthetics, Engineering and Mathematics.\n* [[School of the Arts, Singapore]], focuses on Visual, Literary and Performing Arts.\n* [[Singapore Sports School]]s, focuses on Sports and Athletics.\n\n===Admission to post-secondary institutions===\nUpon completion of the 4- or 5-year secondary school education, students (excluding IP students) will participate in the annual [[Singaporean GCE 'O' Level]], the results of which determine which pre-universities or post-secondary institutions they may apply for. Pre-university centres include junior colleges for a two-year course leading up to [[GCE 'A' Level]], or the Millennia Institute for a three-year course leading up to [[GCE 'A' Level]]. Junior colleges and the Millennia Institute accept students on merit, with a greater emphasis on academics than vocational technical education. Students who wish to pursue specialised education go on to pre-universities institutions such as the polytechnics or arts institutions where they receive a diploma upon successful completion of their courses.\n\nAdmission to a two-year pre-university course at junior colleges after graduating from secondary school is determined by the L1R5 (English + 5 relevant subjects) scoring system. This scoring system is based on the 'O' Level subject grades, which range from A1 (best) to F9 (worst). The candidate adds the numerical grades for six different subjects: English (or another language taken at the 'first language' level), a Humanities subject, a Science/Mathematics subject, a Humanities/Science/Mathematics subject, and two other subjects of any kind. The best L1R5 unmodified score is therefore 6, for a student with A1 grades in six subjects which meet the criteria.\n\nStudents scoring 20 points and below may be admitted for either a Science or Arts Course. In addition, a student must also achieve at least a C6 grade, which is 50% or higher, in the GCE 'O' Level English Language and Mathematics papers to qualify for junior college admission. Pre-university centres that are particularly associated with academic excellence, however, usually expect students to attain points in the single digits, to be admitted. This is because the system is merit-driven, with places given to those with lower scores first.\n\nFor admission to a three-year pre-university course at the Millennia Institute, the L1R4 (English + 4 relevant subjects) scoring system is used, and students are expected to score below 20 points to be admitted. Students may opt for any of the science, arts or commerce streams when pursuing a three-year pre-university course.\n\n==Pre-university and post-secondary studies==\nThe pre-university centres of Singapore such as Junior Colleges and Centralized institute are designed for students who wish to pursue a local university degree after two to three years of pre-university education. Alternatively, polytechnics and arts institutions in Singapore prepare students for both workforce and university studies.\n\nThere are 19 [[Junior college (Singapore)|Junior Colleges]] (JCs) and a Centralised Institute (CI), the [[Millennia Institute]] (MI, established 2004), with the [[National Junior College]] (NJC, established 1969) being the oldest and Eunoia Junior College (EJC, established 2017) the newest.\n\nBesides junior colleges, most graduates of polytechnics and arts institutions continue to pursue further tertiary education at overseas and local universities. Those with good grades are given exemptions for university modules completed in Polytechnic, notably universities in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.\n\n===Junior college===\n{{Main|Junior college (Singapore)}}\nJunior colleges (JCs) in Singapore were initially designed to offer an accelerated alternative to the traditional three-year programme, but the two-year programme has since become the norm for students pursuing university education.\n\nJCs accept students based on their GCE \"O\" Level results; an L1R5 score of 20 points or less must be attained for a student to gain admission. JCs provide a 2-year course leading up to the [[Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level]] (\"A\" level) examination. The CI accepts students based on their GCE \"O\" Level results; an L1R4 score of 20 points or less must be attained for a student to gain admission. The MI provides a 3-year course leading up to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level (\"A\" level) examination.\n\nAll students are required to participate in at least one CCA (Co-Curricular Activities) as CCA performance is considered for university admission.<ref name=\"pre-u\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moe.gov.sg/education/pre-u/ |title=Pre-University Education |work=Ministry of Education, Singapore |accessdate=16 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623164927/http://www.moe.gov.sg/education/pre-u/ |archivedate=23 June 2011  }}</ref>\n\n===Centralised Institute===\n{{Main|Centralised institutes (Singapore)}}\nThe Centralised Institutes accept students based on their GCE \"O\" level results and their L1R4 score (which must be 20 points or below). A Centralised Institute provides a three-year course leading up to a GCE \"A\" level examination. There were originally four Centralized Institutes: [[Outram Institute]], [[Townsville Institute]], [[Jurong Institute]] and [[Seletar Institute]]. [[Townsville Institute]] and [[Seletar Institute]] stopped accepting new students after the 1995 school year and closed down after the last batch of students graduated in 1997.\n\nThere currently remains only one Centralised Institute in Singapore, the [[Millennia Institute]], which was formed following the merger of Jurong and Outram Institutes. Additionally, only Centralised Institutes offer the Commerce Stream offering subjects such as Principles of Accounting and Management of Business. The standard of teaching and curriculum is identical to that of the Junior Colleges.\n\n===Polytechnics and Arts institutions===\n[[File:Temasek Polytechnic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Temasek Polytechnic, third polytechnic established in Singapore]]\nThe first polytechnic in Singapore, [[Singapore Polytechnic]], was established in 1954.<ref name=\"worldbank\">{{cite news|title=Singapore's Education System: 1820s \u2013 1945|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTAFRREGTOPEDUCATION/Resources/444659-1204656846740/4734984-1212686310562/Toward_a_better_future_Singapore.pdf |accessdate=29 November 2012 |publisher=National Library Board Singapore }}</ref> [[Ngee Ann Polytechnic]], has roots that go back to 1963.<ref name=\"worldbank\" /> Two other polytechnics, [[Temasek Polytechnic]] and [[Nanyang Polytechnic]] were established in the 1990s.<ref name=\"worldbank\" /> The most recent, [[Republic Polytechnic]] was established in 2003.<ref name=\"worldbank\" /> The two Arts Institutions, [[Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts]] and [[LASALLE College of the Arts]], started off as fully private educational providers but eventually were absorbed by the Ministry of Education before becoming autonomous, operating under private management with government fundings.\n\nPolytechnics and arts institutions in Singapore provide 3-year diploma courses. They accept students based on their GCE \"O\" level, GCE \"A\" level or Institute of Technical Education (ITE) results.\n\nPolytechnics offer a wide range of courses in various fields, including engineering, business studies, [[accountancy]], tourism and hospitality management, mass [[Communication studies|communications]], digital media and [[biotechnology]]. There are also specialised courses such as marine engineering, nautical studies, [[nursing]], and [[optometry]]. They provide a more industry-oriented education as an alternative to junior colleges for post-secondary studies.

There are [[Institute of Technical Education#Colleges|three ITE colleges]] in Singapore. Only a few ITE graduates will be able to continue their education at polytechnics and arts institutions which then, if possible goes on to a university. ITE colleges offer apprenticeships for the skilled trades and diplomas in vocational education for skilled technicians and workers in support roles in professions such as engineering, accountancy, business administration, nursing, medicine, architecture, and law. The ITE is highly recognized vocational institution in producing highly skilled graduates that are in demand by employers. Salaries for ITE graduates, who receive a National ITE Certificate (NITEC) or a diploma have also become quite high.

International and private schools in Singapore generally do not admit Singapore students without permission from the Ministry of Education.\n\nHowever, on 29 April 2004 the Ministry of Education permitted three new international schools to be set up without permission being needed to admit Singapore students. These schools must follow the compulsory policies set by the Ministry such as playing the [[Majulah Singapura|national anthem]] and taking the pledge every morning, as well as following the nation's policies on bilingualism. These schools \u2013 [[Anglo-Chinese School (International) Singapore|Anglo-Chinese School (International)]], [[Hwa Chong International School]] and [[SJI International School]] \u2013 are private schools run by the boards of other locally renowned institutions. The school fees are 15 to 20 percent lower than those of foreign international schools. Their intake includes students from countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], People's Republic of China, Taiwan, [[South Korea]], [[Philippines]], [[Vietnam]], [[Netherlands]], and the United Kingdom.\n\nEstablished under the Private Education Act, the [[Committee for Private Education]] (CPE, also formerly the Council for Private Education) is a statutory board empowered with the legislative power to regulate the private education sector.  In addition to its role as the sectoral regulator of private education institutions, the CPE facilitates capability development efforts to uplift standards in the local private education industry.\n\nOn 20 May 2010, the CPE has registered the first batch of private education institutions (PEIs) under the Enhanced Registration Framework (ERF). Following the launch of the new private education regulatory regime on 21 December 2009, all PEIs within the regulatory scope of the Private Education Act are required to register with the CPE under the ERF. Under the Enhanced Registration Framework, private institutions must meet requirements relating to their managers, teachers, courses and examination boards. Out of 308 which applied, less than a third were given the stamp of approval and students are relieved that their school has made the mark. Only 63 ERF applications have been evaluated by the CPE, of which 36 PEIs like [[Management Development Institute of Singapore|MDIS]], EASB, SDH Institute, SAA Global Education, Coleman College, STEi Institute etc. have been registered for a period of four years ERF, and 26 PEIs have been registered for one year. The registration period awarded to a PEI is dependent on its degree of compliance with the Private Education Regulations.\n\nIn addition to the international day school, [[Japanese expatriates in Singapore|Singapore's Japanese population]] is served by a [[hoshuko|weekend education programme]], the Japanese Supplementary School Singapore (JSS; \u30b7\u30f3\u30ac\u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u88dc\u7fd2\u6388\u696d\u6821 ''Shingap\u014dru Nihongo Hosh\u016b Jugy\u014d K\u014d'').<ref>\"[http://www.jss.edu.sg/contact  \u304a\u554f\u5408\u305b\u30da\u30fc\u30b8].\" The Japanese Supplementary School Singapore.

While English is the first language and the medium of instruction in schools, most students are required to take a \"Mother Tongue\" subject, which could be one of the three official languages: Standard Mandarin, Malay or Tamil. A non-Tamil Indian may choose to offer Tamil or a non-official language such as [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] or [[Urdu]]. However, Chinese students from a non-Mandarin background, such as Cantonese speakers, must learn Mandarin, and students with Indonesian background must learn Malay. Non-Chinese, Malay or Indian students may choose to learn either one of these languages (Usually the Japanese, Koreans and Southeast Asians who are not from Malay or Indonesian origin will choose Chinese). Mother Tongue is a compulsory examinable subject at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) and the GCE \"N\", \"O\" and \"A\" level examinations. Students are required to achieve a certain level of proficiency in what the government considers their mother tongue as a pre-requisite for admission to local universities. Students returning from overseas may be exempted from this policy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Returning Singaporeans \u2013 Mother Tongue Policy|date=25 August 2006|publisher=Ministry of Education, Singapore|url=http://www.moe.gov.sg/esp/eduinfo/mt.htm|access-date=27 November 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127234307/http://www.moe.gov.sg/esp/eduinfo/mt.htm|archive-date=27 November 2006|url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe bilingual policy was first adopted in 1966.<ref name=\"peopledaily20050513\">{{cite news|title = Interview: Chinese Language education in Singapore faces new opportunities | publisher = People's Daily Online|date=13 May 2005|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200505/13/eng20050513_184878.html}}</ref> One of its primary objectives is to promote English as the common (and neutral) language among the [[Demographics of Singapore|diverse ethnic groups in Singapore]].
