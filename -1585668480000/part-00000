It is picturesquely situated in the valley of the [[Salza (Austria)|Salza]], amid the north Styrian [[Alps]].\n\nIt is a site of pilgrimage for [[Catholic]]s from Austria and neighboring countries. The object of veneration is an image of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] reputed to work [[miracle]]s, carved in lime-tree wood. This was brought to the place in 1157, and is now enshrined in a chapel adorned with objects of silver and other costly materials. The large church of which the chapel forms part was erected in 1644 as an expansion of a smaller church built by [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I, King of Hungary]], after a victory over the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1363. \n\n==History==\n{{Prose|date=October 2013}}\n<!--PLEASE REVERT THE USE OF A TIMELINE AND WRITE PROPER ARTICLE-->\nThere is no trace of large or enclosed settlements in the area of modern Mariazell dating from pre-Christian times or the first century A.D. The large number of [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] and [[Celt]]ic mountain and river names in the region, such as for example the [[Erlauf (river)|Erlauf]], however, suggest small settlements by these tribes. The [[salt]] [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] in Halltal were not unknown to these groups.\n\nBy 16 AD the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] were using the salt roads of Halltal and the [[Traisen (river)|Traisental]]. According to some accounts, there also was a Roman road going to Neuhaus.\n\nIn 600 the [[Slavs]], under the leadership of the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], took control of the land and settled in the mountain region and began farming. The expansion of these peoples also accounts for the existence of some of the town and mountain names today.\n\nIn 1025, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Conrad II]] gave his sister-in-law Beatrix, married to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]], parts of the county in the M\u00fcrztale as a gift. With this gift came around 100 ''Huben'',{{Clarify|date=June 2009}} which belonged to the territory of the future market of Mariazell.\nThere was an argument for one year over this gift involving the Reichsgericht and even the Pope. Eberhard, [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Archbishop of Salzburg]], decided in 1151 in favor of the [[Monastery of St. Lambrecht]]. It was allowed to control part of the parish territory of Mariazell and of the dominion of [[Aflenz Kurort|Aflenz]]. The date, December 21, 1157, is taken off a document from Pope [[Adrian IV]], still traditionally celebrated as the date of Mariazell's establishment, even though it cannot be proven historically.\n\nIn 1157, Monk Magnus came into the Zellertal with a lime-tree wood statue of the Virgin Mary and founded the first chapel there, around which the town later grew. The town's name derived from the description \"Mary in the cell\", i.e. in the monk's chapel.\n\nIn 1344, Mariazell was elevated to the status of [[market town]].\n\nBetween 1340 and 1380, the church was rebuilt in the [[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic]] style.\n\nIn 1420, the Turks of the [[Ottoman Empire]] invaded Mariazell for the first time and burned the church and the town.\n\nIn 1474, another fire devastated the town.\n\nIn [[Ottoman_wars_in_Europe#1526\u20131566:_Conquest_of_the_Kingdom_of_Hungary|1532]], the Turks returned to Mariazell and set more houses on fire.\n\n[[File:Mariazell basilika 2.jpeg|thumb|Gothic Portal]]\n[[File:Mariazell grazerstrasse.jpg|thumb|The Grazerstra\u00dfe]]\n\n1644: The \"[[baroque]]-ization\" of the church is begun by Abbot Benedikt Pierin, and the commission is given to Master Builder Sciassia. After his death the construction is continued by various other workers before being completed in 1780.\n\n1679: Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] visited the shrine, and a valet in his entourage brought the plague to Mariazell. Fear and terror took hold as 156 townspeople fell victim to the disease.\n\n1683: Fears arising from yet another Ottoman [[Battle of Vienna|invasion]] caused the holy statue as well as the treasury images to be sent to St. Lambrecht, from which they were returned later that year.\n\n1742: The Empress granted Abbot Eugen Inzaghi the privileges of an Archabbot over Gollrad and Aschbach, as well as over the Mariazell cast iron works.\n\nIn 1782, [[Joseph Haydn]] wrote the Mariazell Mass, for pilgrims to the Basilica in Mariazell.  The mass was commissioned at the request of the pilgrims, through a military officer.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.508009&catNum=508009&filetype=About%20this%20Recording&language=English# |title = HAYDN, J.: Masses (Complete) (Trinity Choir, Rebel Baroque Orchestra, Burdick, Glover) (8 CD Box set)}}</ref>\n\nIn 1786, Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] dissolves the Monastery of St. Lambrecht, from which Mariazell was serviced, in the course of his cloister abolishments. The pilgrimages are hampered and later completely forbidden.\n\nIn 1798, a conflagration destroys the town; the area of Wiener Stra\u00dfe is especially hard hit.\n\n1805: The [[Battle of Mariazell]] is fought in the area during the [[War of the Third Coalition]] as the French invade Austria.\n\n1809: Faced with a French advance in the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]], church treasures are brought to [[Timi\u0219oara|Temesv\u00e1r]] in [[Hungary]] for security. A few weeks later, the French arrive at Mariazell. Combat operations, requisition, and crop failures lead in these years to a massive decrease in population.\n\n1816: A great famine takes place. [[Archduke Johann of Austria|Archduke Johann]] introduces the [[potato]] and plants it in the poor fields of the area to combat hunger.\n\n1818: Archduke Johann buys the Brandhof.\n\n1827: Mariazell's largest fire, which incinerates almost the entire town, and leaves the church with great fire damage, occurs on [[All Souls' Night]].\n\n1828 - 1832: The town is rebuilt with great hardship and suffering.\n\n1892: The idle boring machine of the cast-iron factory is converted to a power plant; the following year, Mariazell gets electric power for the first time.\n\n1896: The building of the first public water service begins.\n\n1898: The Mariazell cast iron factory is shut down.\n\n1907: The [[Mariazellerbahn]], finished the previous year, is opened for public transport. That same year, the [[Mariazell Basilica]] is elevated to a [[Basilica#Minor basilicas|Basilica Minor]].\n\n1911: The Mariazellerbahn becomes electric.\n[[File:Mariazell denkmal.jpg|thumb|Monument to the builders of the Mariazellerbahn]]\n[[File:Mariazell friedhof 1 ArM.jpg|thumb|The cemetery in deep snow]]\n1924: The first festival in the newly built festival theatre is begun.\n\n1925: The festivals reach their high point. In the following years, financial decline brings them to an end.\n\n1928: A gondola to the [[B\u00fcrger Alps]] becomes the first [[funicular]] to be built in Austria. That same year, the water system in expanded around the \"Student-Quelle\".\n\n1945: The [[Red Army]] enters Mariazell and takes accommodations for 5,000 men.\n\n1948: Mariazell is elevated to the status of a city.\n\n1955 - 1957: A general restoration of the church takes place. During these years, a by-pass and a new post office are built.\n\n1966: The fathers of the Kremsm\u00fcnster Monastery separate from the fathers of the [[Schottenstift]], who had been in charge of the ecclesiastical leadership of Mariazell since 1949. In the following years, extensive restoration work is done on the church, the [[priory]], and the nearby chapel. The new rosary path is also built during this time.\n\n1976: Mariazell gains an indoor swimming pool and, a few years later, the enlargement of its [[Hauptschule]].\n\n1983: Pope [[John Paul II]] visits Mariazell. The papal altar is built in the main plaza. In the course of this great event, the entire city receives a fa\u00e7ade facelift, the main plaza is redesigned, and parks are created.\n\n1990: Thanksgiving and freedom pilgrimages from the former [[Eastern Bloc]] states bring 25,000 participants to Mariazell.\n\n1992: The [[Order of Saint Benedict|Bendictines]] of [[Kremsm\u00fcnster]] transfer the duty of pastoral care for the pilgrimages into the custody of the founding monastery and mother cloister of St. Lambrecht.\n\n2004: Central European Catholic Day - a pilgrimage of the people to Mariazell brings over 100,000 visitors.\n\n2007: [[Pope Benedict XVI]] visits Mariazell to celebrate the 850th anniversary of the foundation of the Shrine of Mariazell.\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Municipal council===\nThe municipal council has 15 members; the 2010 elections returned:\n*8 [[Austrian People's Party|\u00d6VP]]\n*4 Gemeinsam f\u00fcr Mariazell\n*3 [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|SP\u00d6]]\n\n===City council===\nThe city council consists of the following members:\n*Josef Kuss (\u00d6VP) \u2013 Mayor\n*Helmut Schweiger (\u00d6VP) - Vice-Mayor\n*Walter Surb\u00f6ck (Gemeinsam f\u00fcr Mariazell) - Financial Officer\n\n===Coat of Arms===\nThe city coat of arms shows a black shield with a stylized depiction of the Gothic archway of the Mariazell Basilica in gold. Before it stands the gold-crowned Mariazeller Madonna with a similarly crowned Christ Child on her right arm. The Madonna wears a blue cloak and is wrapped in a silver-white robe, as is the Christ Child. The chests of both figures are adorned with a small cross.\n\n==Culture and landmarks==\n[[File:Mariazel gnadenbild.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Holy image of Magna Mater Austriae]]\n\nMost notable about the [[Mariazell Basilica]], built in the 14th and 15th centuries but with a superb baroque interior, are the three towers on its western front. The church houses the ''Magna Mater Austriae'' (\"Great Mother of Austria\") in its so-called ''Gnadenkapelle''. The holy image is a small wooden [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Marian]] statue from the 13th century, which is clothed in a splendid garment and plays a great role in the popular devotions of many [[Roman Catholicism in Austria|Austrian Catholics]].\n\n==Transport==\nMariazell lies on the highway B 20, which goes from [[St. P\u00f6lten]] over the [[Seebergsattel]] to [[Kapfenberg]] im [[M\u00fcrz]] Valley. There is a connection through the Salza Valley to the east either over the Gscheid to [[St. Aegyd am Neuwalde]], into the [[Piesting]] Valley und then further into the [[Viennese Basin]] (B 21) or over the Lahnsattel into the M\u00fcrz Valley and onward to [[M\u00fcrzzuschlag]] (B 23).\n\nMariazell is also the southern endpoint of the [[Mariazell railway line]], a [[narrow gauge]] [[electric railway]] from [[St P\u00f6lten]]. However the terminus of the line at [[Mariazell railway station|Mariazell station]] lies around {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} north of the city center in the municipal territory of [[Sankt Sebastian, Austria|Sankt Sebastian]]. The station is also the terminus of the ''[[Museumstramway Mariazell-Erlaufsee]]'', a [[standard gauge]] [[heritage railway|heritage]] [[steam tramway]] that operates to the nearby [[Erlaufsee]].<ref name=tr-232-34-38>{{cite news | title = Mariazellerbahn: Modernised but still charming | work = Today's Railways Europe | date = April 2015 | publisher = Platform 5 Publishing Ltd | pages = 34\u201338 | first = Tomay | last = Ba\u010di\u0107 | issue = 232}}</ref>\n\n[[Mariazell Airport]] is a private use [[airport]] that is located {{convert|2|km|0}} north-northwest of Mariazell.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Austria}}\n\n===Twin towns - Sister cities===\nMariazell is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|HUN}} [[Esztergom]] in Hungary <small>''(since May 6, 2002)''</small>\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Loreto (AN)|Loreto]] in [[Italy]]\n\n==References==\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Mariazell|volume=17|page=709}}\n;Notes\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071004214851/http://www.eurovia.tv/home/index.php?lang=en%2F Eurovia - Association for the Establishment of European Pilgrimage Routes]\n{{commons|Mariazell}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060603174437/http://www.katholikentag.at/index.siteswift Central European Catholic Day (''Mitteleurop\u00e4ischer Katholikentag'')] {{in lang|de}}\n*[http://www.basilika-mariazell.at/ Bazillika Mariazell] {{in lang|de}}\n*[http://www.mariazell.at/ Mariazell und das Mariazeller Land] {{in lang|de}}\n\n{{Cities and towns in Bruck an der Mur (district)}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Bruck-M\u00fcrzzuschlag District]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=June 2014}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name            = Mariazell\n| native_name     = \n| settlement_type = \n<!-- Images     -->\n| image_skyline   = Mariazell - Basilika1.JPG\n| imagesize       = \n| image_caption   = The [[Mariazell Basilica]]\n| image_shield    = AUT Mariazell COA.jpg\n| shield_size     = 80x110px\n| shield_link     = \n<!-- Maps           -->\n| pushpin_map         = Austria\n| pushpin_mapsize     = 270\n| pushpin_map_caption = Location within Austria\n| image_map           = \n| mapsize             = \n| map_alt             =\n| map_caption         = Location within Bruck-M\u00fcrzzuschlag district\n<!-- Location    -->\n| coordinates       = {{coord|47|46|23|N|15|18|59|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type  = Country\n| subdivision_name  = [[Austria]]\n| subdivision_type1 = [[States of Austria|State]]\n| subdivision_name1 = [[Styria]]\n| subdivision_type2 = [[District (Austria)|District]]\n| subdivision_name2 = [[Bruck-M\u00fcrzzuschlag District|Bruck-M\u00fcrzzuschlag]]\n| parts_type        = \n| parts_style       = para\n| p1                = \n<!-- Leaders -->\n| leader_title  = [[Burgomaster|Mayor]]\n| leader_name   = Manfred Seebacher\n| leader_party  = {{Polparty|Austria| SP\u00d6 }}\n| leader_title1 = \n| leader_name1  = \n<!-- Statistics -->\n| area_footnotes   = {{Austria population Wikidata|area_footnotes}}\n| area_total_km2   = {{Austria population Wikidata|area_total_km2}}\n| area_metro_km2   = \n| elevation_m      = 868\n| elevation_max_m  = \n| elevation_min_m  = \n| population_as_of = {{Austria population Wikidata|population_as_of}}\n| population_footnotes = {{Austria population Wikidata|population_footnotes}}\n| population_total = {{Austria population Wikidata|population_total}}\n| population_urban =  \n| population_metro =  \n| population_note  = \n| population_density_km2 = auto\n| established_title = \n| established_date  = \n| timezone          = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n| timezone_DST      = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n| utc_offset        = +1\n| utc_offset_DST    = +2\n| registration_plate = [[Vehicle registration plates of Austria|BM]]\n| postal_code_type   = [[List of postal codes in Austria|Postal code]]\n| postal_code        = 8630\n| area_code_type = [[Telephone numbers in Austria|Area code]]\n| area_code      = 03882\n| website   = [http://www.stadt-mariazell.at www.stadt-mariazell.at]\n| footnotes = \n}}\n'''Mariazell''' is a small city in [[Austria]], in [[Styria]], well known for [[winter sports]], {{convert|143|km|0|abbr=off}} north of [[Graz]].

In the course of this great event, the entire city receives a fa\u00e7ade facelift, the main plaza is redesigned, and parks are created.\n\n1990: Thanksgiving and freedom pilgrimages from the former [[Eastern Bloc]] states bring 25,000 participants to Mariazell.\n\n1992: The [[Order of Saint Benedict|Bendictines]] of [[Kremsm\u00fcnster]] transfer the duty of pastoral care for the pilgrimages into the custody of the founding monastery and mother cloister of St. Lambrecht.\n\n2004: Central European Catholic Day - a pilgrimage of the people to Mariazell brings over 100,000 visitors.\n\n2007: [[Pope Benedict XVI]] visits Mariazell to celebrate the 850th anniversary of the foundation of the Shrine of Mariazell.\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Municipal council===\nThe municipal council has 15 members; the 2010 elections returned:\n*8 [[Austrian People's Party|\u00d6VP]]\n*4 Gemeinsam f\u00fcr Mariazell\n*3 [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|SP\u00d6]]\n\n===City council===\nThe city council consists of the following members:\n*Josef Kuss (\u00d6VP) \u2013 Mayor\n*Helmut Schweiger (\u00d6VP) - Vice-Mayor\n*Walter Surb\u00f6ck (Gemeinsam f\u00fcr Mariazell) - Financial Officer\n\n===Coat of Arms===\nThe city coat of arms shows a black shield with a stylized depiction of the Gothic archway of the Mariazell Basilica in gold. Before it stands the gold-crowned Mariazeller Madonna with a similarly crowned Christ Child on her right arm. The Madonna wears a blue cloak and is wrapped in a silver-white robe, as is the Christ Child. The chests of both figures are adorned with a small cross.\n\n==Culture and landmarks==\n[[File:Mariazel gnadenbild.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Holy image of Magna Mater Austriae]]\n\nMost notable about the [[Mariazell Basilica]], built in the 14th and 15th centuries but with a superb baroque interior, are the three towers on its western front. The church houses the ''Magna Mater Austriae'' (\"Great Mother of Austria\") in its so-called ''Gnadenkapelle''. The holy image is a small wooden [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Marian]] statue from the 13th century, which is clothed in a splendid garment and plays a great role in the popular devotions of many [[Roman Catholicism in Austria|Austrian Catholics]].\n\n==Transport==\nMariazell lies on the highway B 20, which goes from [[St. P\u00f6lten]] over the [[Seebergsattel]] to [[Kapfenberg]] im [[M\u00fcrz]] Valley. There is a connection through the Salza Valley to the east either over the Gscheid to [[St. Aegyd am Neuwalde]], into the [[Piesting]] Valley und then further into the [[Viennese Basin]] (B 21) or over the Lahnsattel into the M\u00fcrz Valley and onward to [[M\u00fcrzzuschlag]] (B 23).\n\nMariazell is also the southern endpoint of the [[Mariazell railway line]], a [[narrow gauge]] [[electric railway]] from [[St P\u00f6lten]]. However the terminus of the line at [[Mariazell railway station|Mariazell station]] lies around {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} north of the city center in the municipal territory of [[Sankt Sebastian, Austria|Sankt Sebastian]]. The station is also the terminus of the ''[[Museumstramway Mariazell-Erlaufsee]]'', a [[standard gauge]] [[heritage railway|heritage]] [[steam tramway]] that operates to the nearby [[Erlaufsee]].<ref name=tr-232-34-38>{{cite news | title = Mariazellerbahn: Modernised but still charming | work = Today's Railways Europe | date = April 2015 | publisher = Platform 5 Publishing Ltd | pages = 34\u201338 | first = Tomay | last = Ba\u010di\u0107 | issue = 232}}</ref>\n\n[[Mariazell Airport]] is a private use [[airport]] that is located {{convert|2|km|0}} north-northwest of Mariazell.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Austria}}\n\n===Twin towns - Sister cities===\nMariazell is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|HUN}} [[Esztergom]] in Hungary <small>''(since May 6, 2002)''</small>\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Loreto (AN)|Loreto]] in [[Italy]]\n\n==References==\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Mariazell|volume=17|page=709}}\n;Notes\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071004214851/http://www.eurovia.tv/home/index.php?lang=en%2F Eurovia - Association for the Establishment of European Pilgrimage Routes]\n{{commons|Mariazell}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060603174437/http://www.katholikentag.at/index.siteswift Central European Catholic Day (''Mitteleurop\u00e4ischer Katholikentag'')] {{in lang|de}}\n*[http://www.basilika-mariazell.at/ Bazillika Mariazell] {{in lang|de}}\n*[http://www.mariazell.at/ Mariazell und das Mariazeller Land] {{in lang|de}}\n\n{{Cities and towns in Bruck an der Mur (district)}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Bruck-M\u00fcrzzuschlag District]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "Timi\u0219oara(viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariazell"}

It has also been seen carried on a twin rail mount on a modified [[M53/59 Praga]] armored [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|SPAAG]] of (former) Czechoslovakian origin. These missiles have been modified with the addition of a first stage booster motor, with the missile's own motor becoming the sustainer.

One missile hit, detaching 4 meters of the left wing and killing 2 passengers. The plane made an emergency landing on a frozen lake.\n\nOn 21 June 1978, a PVO MiG-23M flown by Pilot Captain V. Shkinder [[1978 Iranian Chinook shootdown|shot down two Iranian Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters]] that had trespassed into Soviet airspace, one helicopter being dispatched by two R-60 missiles and the other by cannon fire.\n\n===Syria===\nSeveral Russian reports affirm the AA-8 was widely used during the 1982 Lebanon war, and it was the main weapon used by the [[Syria]]ns in air-to-air combat. Some Russian reports affirm that the R-60 was the most successful air-to-air missile deployed by the Syrians in Lebanon over the [[Bekaa Valley]] in 1982<ref>[http://backfiretu-22m.tripod.com/id11.html SyAAF MiG-23 comabat record.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116115958/http://backfiretu-22m.tripod.com/id11.html |date=16 January 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airwar.ru/history/locwar/bv/mig23/mig23.html|title=-23|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref> According to Israeli reports, the vast majority of air-to-air combat consisted of visual range dogfights, and this has been also confirmed by Russian sources. The Russian reports also mentioned that several [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4s]], [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]], [[IAI Kfir]]s were destroyed by R-60s among other aircraft. Israel claims some F-4s and Kfirs were lost in 1982, but lists SAMs as responsible for all Israeli aircraft losses.\n\n===Angola/Cuba===\nOn 27 September 1987, during [[Operation Moduler]], two [[Cuban Revolutionary Air and Air Defense Force|Cuban FAR]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23MLs]] intercepted Captain Arthur Piercy's [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F1CZ]], which was damaged by either an [[R-23 (missile)|R-23]] or an R-60 fired head-on by Major Alberto Ley Rivas. The explosion destroyed the aircraft's [[drogue parachute|drag chute]] and damaged the hydraulics. Piercy was able to recover to AFB Rundu, but the aircraft overshot the runway. The impact with the rough terrain caused Piercy's [[ejection seat]] to fire, but he failed to separate from the seat and suffered major spinal injuries.<ref name=\"vlamgat\">{{cite book |title=Vlamgat: The Story of the Mirage F1 in the South African Air Force |last=Lord |first=Dick |authorlink=Dick Lord |year=2000 |publisher=Covos-Day |isbn=0-620-24116-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/urrib2000/ArticPiercy.html |archive-url= http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20140907054816/http://www.geocities.com/urrib2000/ArticPiercy.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 September 2014 |title=Piloto SAAF derribado por MiG-23 cubano |accessdate=20 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 August 1988, a [[British Aerospace 125|BAe-125]] owned by the [[politics of Botswana|Botswana government]] was carrying the [[President of Botswana]], [[Quett Masire]], and his staff to a meeting in Luanda.

It has also been seen carried on a twin rail mount on a modified [[M53/59 Praga]] armored [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|SPAAG]] of (former) Czechoslovakian origin. These missiles have been modified with the addition of a first stage booster motor, with the missile's own motor becoming the sustainer. This was done in lieu of modifying the missile's motor for ground launch, as in the case of the US [[MIM-72 Chaparral]].\n\nThe current Russian dogfight missile is the [[R-73 (missile)]] (AA-11 \"Archer\"), but large numbers of R-60 missiles remain in service.\n\n==Operational history==\n===Soviet Union===\nOn 20 April 1978 two R-60 missiles were fired at [[Korean Air Lines Flight 902]] after a navigational error had caused it to fly into Russian airspace. One missile hit, detaching 4 meters of the left wing and killing 2 passengers. The plane made an emergency landing on a frozen lake.\n\nOn 21 June 1978, a PVO MiG-23M flown by Pilot Captain V. Shkinder [[1978 Iranian Chinook shootdown|shot down two Iranian Boeing CH-47 Chinook helicopters]] that had trespassed into Soviet airspace, one helicopter being dispatched by two R-60 missiles and the other by cannon fire.\n\n===Syria===\nSeveral Russian reports affirm the AA-8 was widely used during the 1982 Lebanon war, and it was the main weapon used by the [[Syria]]ns in air-to-air combat. Some Russian reports affirm that the R-60 was the most successful air-to-air missile deployed by the Syrians in Lebanon over the [[Bekaa Valley]] in 1982<ref>[http://backfiretu-22m.tripod.com/id11.html SyAAF MiG-23 comabat record.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116115958/http://backfiretu-22m.tripod.com/id11.html |date=16 January 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airwar.ru/history/locwar/bv/mig23/mig23.html|title=-23|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}</ref> According to Israeli reports, the vast majority of air-to-air combat consisted of visual range dogfights, and this has been also confirmed by Russian sources. The Russian reports also mentioned that several [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4s]], [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]], [[IAI Kfir]]s were destroyed by R-60s among other aircraft. Israel claims some F-4s and Kfirs were lost in 1982, but lists SAMs as responsible for all Israeli aircraft losses.\n\n===Angola/Cuba===\nOn 27 September 1987, during [[Operation Moduler]], two [[Cuban Revolutionary Air and Air Defense Force|Cuban FAR]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|MiG-23MLs]] intercepted Captain Arthur Piercy's [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F1CZ]], which was damaged by either an [[R-23 (missile)|R-23]] or an R-60 fired head-on by Major Alberto Ley Rivas. The explosion destroyed the aircraft's [[drogue parachute|drag chute]] and damaged the hydraulics. Piercy was able to recover to AFB Rundu, but the aircraft overshot the runway. The impact with the rough terrain caused Piercy's [[ejection seat]] to fire, but he failed to separate from the seat and suffered major spinal injuries.<ref name=\"vlamgat\">{{cite book |title=Vlamgat: The Story of the Mirage F1 in the South African Air Force |last=Lord |first=Dick |authorlink=Dick Lord |year=2000 |publisher=Covos-Day |isbn=0-620-24116-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/urrib2000/ArticPiercy.html |archive-url= http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20140907054816/http://www.geocities.com/urrib2000/ArticPiercy.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 September 2014 |title=Piloto SAAF derribado por MiG-23 cubano |accessdate=20 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 August 1988, a [[British Aerospace 125|BAe-125]] owned by the [[politics of Botswana|Botswana government]] was carrying the [[President of Botswana]], [[Quett Masire]], and his staff to a meeting in Luanda.

The Kyushu Railway was nationalised on 1 July 1907.
