Quickly alters his path to follow the ball, Kuramochi catches it and throws backwards to Haruichi who catches it and throws it to first successfully completing the double play. With two outs, Nori consecutively walks two batters. And in the dugout, Kataoka tells Kanemaru to fetch Sawamura. The scene pans to the Yakushi dugout where Raizou reveals that the reason why Nori is messing up is because he probably can't feel anything with his fingertips from the impact of Raichi's pitches. Feeling the pressure of being on the mound, Nori pitches but the batter connects to it and the second-base runner ties the game. Sawamura walks out to the field and towards the mound where, after giving words of encouragement to Sawamura, Nori walks back to the dugout. Sawamura pitches against Akiba who is unable to hit the first pitch. The next pitch is a ball to the outside and Akiba jams the final pitch. However, the third-baseman fails to catch the ball and the runner scores causing Yakushi to take the lead. Sawamura pitches again and Yakushi makes their move, both runners try to steal, but Masuda fouls the pitch and the following pitches. When the batter chokes up on the bat in preparation for a change-up, Miyuki notices and tells Sawamura to pitch his best fastball, one that he had been practicing a ton the night before. The pitch becomes a swinging strikeout. Becoming too excited with wanting to bat Sawamura's pitches, Raichi loses his previous pitch control and walks Haruichi. But when Miyuki walks up to bat, Raichi suddenly fixes his control and strikes Miyuki out with the latter unable to make any contact with the ball. Walking back to the dugout, Miyuki apologizes to Maezono. Everyone is shocked the Miyuki was unable to touch the ball in such a critical moment and questions what might have happened to him.

Finally, hitting the ball, Zono pops a fly, but Kuramochi makes it back home and scores, tying the game. Shirasu gets a base on balls and the bases are loaded again. Now realizing what kind of place the mound is, Raichi's pitching fails to advance the game. Having no other choice, Raizou swaps the players around. Raichi covers third, and in turn the third baseman, Mishima covers first and the first baseman, Sanada, is the new pitcher. The count is two outs, one ball, and the bases are loaded. Mine observes the switch and comments that it is Yakushi's best formation. Knowing that Seidou is going to bat aggressively, Akiba wants to get Higasa to hit an infield grounder. Sanada pitches and Higasa hits it to third base where Raichi is. He catches the ball and throws it to Mishima at first, who barely catches the throw, but nevertheless gets the out. Zono, overly concerned about Miyuki, pesters him, asking him if he's sure he's okay. Kuramochi tells him to stop, but Zono doesn't. Then Kataoka asks Miyuki if he's fine and Miyuki replies that if it looks like he's dragging the team down with how he's playing, then to switch him out. Kataoka agrees and says he'll switch him out no matter how they feel if they're hurting the team, or themselves. Yakushi is up the bat with the next batters being the clean-up. Sawamura's first pitch is a strike and Mishima fouls the next one. Miyuki calls for the next pitch and thinks that instead of being afraid of dragging everyone's morale down, he should have been more straightforward. Sawamura then pitches, and it's a change-up, which strikes out Mishima.

In between that play, Miyuki catches the pitch and throws it to Kuramochi on second, but misthrows and the ball falls short of Kuramochi's mitt. Calling for a time-out, Miyuki tells Sawamura to focus on the batter and that the plan is to pitch one to the inside before finishing Sanada with a change-up. Giving a few words to Miyuki, they get back in positions and Miyuki calls for Sawamura to pitch a cutter to the batter's chest. Feeling determined, Sanada hits the cutter and it goes into center field. Now there's one out with runners on first and third. Seido brings in their infielders a bit and Raizou tells Hirahata to believe in his swing. Miyuki wants to make Hirahata hit a grounder, but instead, the latter decides to bunt. The second pitch is a ball but on the third one Hirahata bunts again, this time it succeeds and Raichi runs home, putting Yakushi back into lead. The count is now two strikes with a runner on second. Batting seventh, Yakushi hits a grounder to second and gives up their third out. At the top of the sixth, Yakushi is in the lead, 4 to 3, and batting first is Sawamura. Meanwhile, Miyuki is getting checked out by a doctor who says that while nothing's broken, his oblique muscles might be injured. Rei reprimands him telling Miyuki that he knows very well what happened to Chis when he was injured. Miyuki says that he's left the decision on whether or not he stays on the field to Kataoka and as long he out on there, he'll do his best. Back to the game at hand, Aso barely makes it to first base and Kuramochi is up next and he strikes out. Toujou is up next and he also gets out, making that the third out.

Back to the game, Miyuki is out on a grounder to third while Maezono struck out with a cutter to the outside. Bottom of the seventh, Sawamura gets the first out by jamming Masuda. Batting next is Mishima. Sawamura quickly gets two strikes, frustrating Mishima. He fights it out with fouls before getting on base with a hit into left field. Raichi is at-bat next and Seidou's battery decides to face him head-on. The first pitch is the change-up and Raichi went for it, but is a foul. The second pitch is another change-up and another foul.

With two outs, Nori consecutively walks two batters. And in the dugout, Kataoka tells Kanemaru to fetch Sawamura.

However, the third-baseman fails to catch the ball and the runner scores causing Yakushi to take the lead. Sawamura pitches again and Yakushi makes their move, both runners try to steal, but Masuda fouls the pitch and the following pitches. When the batter chokes up on the bat in preparation for a change-up, Miyuki notices and tells Sawamura to pitch his best fastball, one that he had been practicing a ton the night before. The pitch becomes a swinging strikeout. Becoming too excited with wanting to bat Sawamura's pitches, Raichi loses his previous pitch control and walks Haruichi. But when Miyuki walks up to bat, Raichi suddenly fixes his control and strikes Miyuki out with the latter unable to make any contact with the ball. Walking back to the dugout, Miyuki apologizes to Maezono. Everyone is shocked the Miyuki was unable to touch the ball in such a critical moment and questions what might have happened to him. Zono goes up to bat and wonders why Miyuki apologized and then realizes that Miyuki might injured from the tackle in the game against Seiko.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = Ace of Diamond (season 2)\n| EpisodeNumber       = 120\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 45\n| Title               = The Field\n| TranslitTitle       = Soko ni Tassha\n| NativeTitle         = \u305d\u3053\u306b\u7acb\u3063\u8005\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2016|2|15}}\n| ShortSummary        = It's the top of the fifth and Maezono is up to bat with one out, bases loaded. The first pitch is a ball, the second is a foul, then another ball, another foul, and the last ball makes it a full count. Finally, hitting the ball, Zono pops a fly, but Kuramochi makes it back home and scores, tying the game. Shirasu gets a base on balls and the bases are loaded again. Now realizing what kind of place the mound is, Raichi's pitching fails to advance the game. Having no other choice, Raizou swaps the players around. Raichi covers third, and in turn the third baseman, Mishima covers first and the first baseman, Sanada, is the new pitcher. The count is two outs, one ball, and the bases are loaded. Mine observes the switch and comments that it is Yakushi's best formation. Knowing that Seidou is going to bat aggressively, Akiba wants to get Higasa to hit an infield grounder. Sanada pitches and Higasa hits it to third base where Raichi is. He catches the ball and throws it to Mishima at first, who barely catches the throw, but nevertheless gets the out. Zono, overly concerned about Miyuki, pesters him, asking him if he's sure he's okay. Kuramochi tells him to stop, but Zono doesn't. Then Kataoka asks Miyuki if he's fine and Miyuki replies that if it looks like he's dragging the team down with how he's playing, then to switch him out. Kataoka agrees and says he'll switch him out no matter how they feel if they're hurting the team, or themselves. Yakushi is up the bat with the next batters being the clean-up. Sawamura's first pitch is a strike and Mishima fouls the next one. Miyuki calls for the next pitch and thinks that instead of being afraid of dragging everyone's morale down, he should have been more straightforward. Sawamura then pitches, and it's a change-up, which strikes out Mishima. Next up to bat is Raichi.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = Ace of Diamond (season 2)\n| EpisodeNumber       = 121\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 46\n| Title               = The Decision\n| NativeTitle         = \u72ec\u65ad\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2016|2|22}}\n| ShortSummary        = Raichi is up to bat and Sawamura greets him with a fastball to the inside which Raichi hits into left field. Up next to bat is Sanada, to whom Miyuki calls for a moving fastball to the outside. Raichi goes for the steal and manages to get it. In between that play, Miyuki catches the pitch and throws it to Kuramochi on second, but misthrows and the ball falls short of Kuramochi's mitt. Calling for a time-out, Miyuki tells Sawamura to focus on the batter and that the plan is to pitch one to the inside before finishing Sanada with a change-up. Giving a few words to Miyuki, they get back in positions and Miyuki calls for Sawamura to pitch a cutter to the batter's chest. Feeling determined, Sanada hits the cutter and it goes into center field. Now there's one out with runners on first and third. Seido brings in their infielders a bit and Raizou tells Hirahata to believe in his swing. Miyuki wants to make Hirahata hit a grounder, but instead, the latter decides to bunt. The second pitch is a ball but on the third one Hirahata bunts again, this time it succeeds and Raichi runs home, putting Yakushi back into lead. The count is now two strikes with a runner on second. Batting seventh, Yakushi hits a grounder to second and gives up their third out. At the top of the sixth, Yakushi is in the lead, 4 to 3, and batting first is Sawamura. Meanwhile, Miyuki is getting checked out by a doctor who says that while nothing's broken, his oblique muscles might be injured. Rei reprimands him telling Miyuki that he knows very well what happened to Chis when he was injured. Miyuki says that he's left the decision on whether or not he stays on the field to Kataoka and as long he out on there, he'll do his best. Back to the game at hand, Aso barely makes it to first base and Kuramochi is up next and he strikes out. Toujou is up next and he also gets out, making that the third out. Sawamura is back up to pitch and strikes out all three batters getting a three for three. Neither teams score in the sixth inning and they head into the seventh.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = Ace of Diamond (season 2)\n| EpisodeNumber       = 122\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 47\n| Title               = Partnership\n| NativeTitle         = \u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u30ca\u30fc\u30b7\u30c3\u30d7\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2016|2|29}}\n| ShortSummary        = At the top of the seventh, Haruichi is up to bat. Sanada throws a powerful shootball that breaks Haruichi's wooden bat and he is out on first. Miyuki bats next but before that, Yakushi High's former pitcher Mino recalls a conversation he's had with Sanada and believes they can make it to Nationals. Back to the game, Miyuki is out on a grounder to third while Maezono struck out with a cutter to the outside. Bottom of the seventh, Sawamura gets the first out by jamming Masuda. Batting next is Mishima. Sawamura quickly gets two strikes, frustrating Mishima. He fights it out with fouls before getting on base with a hit into left field. Raichi is at-bat next and Seidou's battery decides to face him head-on. The first pitch is the change-up and Raichi went for it, but is a foul. The second pitch is another change-up and another foul. The third pitch is a pitch Raichi's been waiting for but it's a swing and miss. Two outs and a runner on base, up to bat is Sanada. Sawamura opens up with a change-up for the first strike. The second and third pitch are fastballs which are supposed to be balls but Sanada swings anyway. The fourth pitch is a change-up, a swing and miss for Sanada and that's the third out. Yakushi once again, fail to score additional runs.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = Ace of Diamond (season 2)\n| EpisodeNumber       = 123\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 48\n| Title               = Party Boys\n| NativeTitle         = \u304a\u796d\u308a\u7537\u3069\u3082\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2016|3|7}}\n| ShortSummary        = After the Miyuki and Sawamura battery prevail against Yakushi's clean-up batters, Sawamura receives compliment from his teammates for his performance. And Kataoka entrusts him the eighth. Wakana, shown watching from the bleachers have a flashback of Sawamura mailing her details of Seidou's victory against Ouya High. Wakana sends a message saying that she wanted to see Sawamura's daily growth in person\u2014 a mail that Sawamura is yet to see. Back to the game, Kataoka tells his players to be aggressive, swing hard and pressure hard. At the top of the eighth, Shirasu is up to bat. He stands on the line to pressure Sanada and to seal inside pitches. Sanada doesn't back down, throwing an inside pitch for the first strike. The second pitch, Shirasu is out on a liner to first. Batting seventh is Seidou's pinch hitter Kanemaru. The first pitch is a ball. Kanemaru hits afterwards and the ball goes over Raichi to left field. He gets a double. Sawamura is up, bunting to advance Kanemaru to third. Batting ninth is Asou, who stands away from the plate. He baits an inside pitch but gets out on first. Nonetheless, he receives praise from his teammates. Bottom of the eighth, Yakushi leads by one, Sawamura hold the Yakushi batters down. At the top of the ninth, Raizou gives his players words of encouragement. Seidou is back to the top of their batting order. Kuramochi hits right to the second baseman, taking him down for the first out. Batting second is Tojou who is very determined to get on base.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = Ace of Diamond (season 2)\n| EpisodeNumber       = 124\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 49\n| Title               = Just You Wait!\n| NativeTitle         = \u5f85\u3063\u3066\u308d!\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2016|3|14}}\n| ShortSummary        = Continuing at the top of the ninth, Kuramochi feels down that he wasn't able to get on base. Sawamura approaches him asking to play catch ball and they join Furuya and Ono at the bullpen. Back to the game with no runners on base and one out, it's Tojou's turn at-bat. The first pitch is a ball. The second pitch, Tojou hits a grounder to the shortstop but is out on first. Yakushi is now one out away from winning the game, and both Furuya and Sawamura cheer the batters. Following Tojou is Haruichi. He hits the shootball, and the ball goes into centerfield. He makes it to first base and looks to steal second. Batting next is Miyuki who hasn't had a hit yet. The first pitch is a strike but Haruichi manages to steal second. The second pitch is a ball to the outside followed by another wide pitch. Raizou is feeling more tense and calls for the time-out. A messenger is sent to the mound telling the team that they may concede a run for they still have the bottom of the inning. The game resumes, Miyuki fights with fouls and eventually an infield hit between short and second. He gets to first while Haruichi advances to third. Batting fifth is Maezono and the outfielders have moved out expecting a big hit. The first pitch is a swing and miss on Maezono but Miyuki steals second. The second pitch however, is another strike, this time on the outside.

Maezono eventually hits with the ball going over the second baseman. Haruichi scores from third base tying the game at 4-4. Mimura notices the fielder didn't catch well, and signals Miyuki to run all the way through. He gets to the plate and scores giving Seidou the lead. Following the 2-RBI from Maezono, Sanada retires Shirasu for the third out then he apologize to his team. Bottom of the ninth, Sawamura asks Kataoka to let him pitch but Kataoka decides to send Furuya instead. The crowd cheers and so does Sawamura who impress both Miyuki and Furuya with his attitude. On the mound, Furuya asks Miyuki if he's alright, and Miyuki replies that the pitcher doesn't have to worry. Furuya is relieved remarking that he can go all out, surprising Miyuki and he leaves the mound giggling to the surprise of many. As he returns to his position, he thinks to himself that he can't be a good captain, not willing to give up his position to anyone.

At the lineup, Sanada realizes Miyuki has been injured all the while and feels frustrated that they didn't notice. Mishima apologizes to Raichi for not getting the fourth batter the chance to bat. Raichi smiles saying that he wanted to face Furuya and didn't want the match to end bringing Mishima to tears. Behind the dugout, Kataoka apologizes to Miyuki for prioritizing the win thus letting Miyuki play, despite of an initial plan of switching Miyuki out the last inning. Miyuki however, is happy that he was able to help the team. He is then sent to the hospital, accompanied by Zono, Kuramochi and Rei. Out of the stadium, the third years congratulate the team. Kataoka is brought to tears as he tells the seniors that they're a part of the reason that they won and thanks them. Meanwhile, Haruichi, Furuya and Sawamura leave the stadium later than their teammates. As they near the exit, Sawamura tells Furuya that he's happy he came to Seidou as well and that he'll steal the ace number from him.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], '''D'''iesel (D), '''M'''ixed traffic (M) engine, '''2'''nd generation (2). A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive till it's successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]][[File:12861 Dakshin link Express pulled in by a WDM2 loco at Visakhapatnam.jpg|thumb|A WDM-2 locomotive at [[Visakhapatnam]]]]\n\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s. The '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"interactive\">{{cite web |url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html |title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive |author=Sheeju Chandran |date= |work= |publisher = Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate = April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n== Orgins ==\nThe WDM-2 history begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[Steam locomotive|steam locomotives]] from Indian Rails. It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600 hp (1,900 kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600 hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be manufactured in India. General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement so the ALCo prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].\n\n== Production History ==\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCo(order no. D3389) in the United States. The first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n\nLater a number of modifications were made and a few subclasses were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by Diesel Loco Modernization Works (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram DBR's\n\nThe WDM-2 is the diesel workhorse of the Indian Railways, being very reliable and rugged.\n\n== Service History ==\nKatni (KTE) was the first shed to hold WDM2. The whole batch of WDM2 imports had all went to KTE.  #18040 was first loco in the series, but #18042 was the first commissioned. The locomotives went to work on passenger and freight duties on all regions of India. Large numbers went to replace steam locomotives, especially on express passenger duties.This loco model was IR's workhorse for the second half of the 20th century, and perhaps the one loco that has an iconic association with IR for many people. These locos are found all over India hauling goods and passenger trains \u2014 the standard workhorse of IR. A single WDM-2 can generally haul around 9 passenger coaches; twin WDM-2's were therefore used for 18-coach trains. Many crack trains of IR used to be double-headed by WDM-2 locos; this has decreased now owing to the electrification of most important sections and the use of more powerful locos. \n\nThe original Alco designs had a 10-day, 3000km maintenance schedule, which was later extended by some modifications to a 14-day schedule. Now  the schedule is  being extended to 30 days by increasing the capacities for various fluids (lubrication oil, etc.), and improving some bearings (mainly, using roller bearings for the suspension). The original WDM-2 bearings were very susceptible to failure.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], '''D'''iesel (D), '''M'''ixed traffic (M) engine, '''2'''nd generation (2). A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive till it's successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]][[File:12861 Dakshin link Express pulled in by a WDM2 loco at Visakhapatnam.jpg|thumb|A WDM-2 locomotive at [[Visakhapatnam]]]]\n\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s. The '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"interactive\">{{cite web |url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html |title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive |author=Sheeju Chandran |date= |work= |publisher = Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate = April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n== Orgins ==\nThe WDM-2 history begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[Steam locomotive|steam locomotives]] from Indian Rails. It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600 hp (1,900 kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600 hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be manufactured in India. General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement so the ALCo prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].\n\n== Production History ==\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCo(order no. D3389) in the United States. The first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n\nLater a number of modifications were made and a few subclasses were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by Diesel Loco Modernization Works (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram DBR's\n\nThe WDM-2 is the diesel workhorse of the Indian Railways, being very reliable and rugged.\n\n== Some of the sheds holding WDM-2/A/B/G locomotives ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left:18040 WDM-2 diesel loco at National Railway Museum, Delhi, Right:18233 WDM-2 Kundan, first diesel loco assembled at DLW,Varanasi\n}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Abu Road railway station|Abu Road]] - 3\n* [[Guwahati railway station|New Guwahati]] - 4\n* [[Jamalpur railway station|Jamalpur]] - 1\n* [[Jhansi Junction railway station|Jhansi]] - 1\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Kurla]] - 1\n* [[New Katni Jn. railway station|New Katni Jn.]] - 1 \n* [[Malda Town railway station|Malda Town]] - 8\n* [[Mughalsarai Junction railway station|Mughalsarai]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] - 3\n* [[Raipur Junction railway station|Raipur]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Tondiarpet]] - 4\n''' Total Locomotioves active in service as of 01-03-2020:''' 30<br />('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.)\n}}\n<br />'''Source:''' http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,366,541,710,717\n\n== Technical specifications<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2d.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Locomotives -- Specific classes : AC Electric|website=www.irfca.org}}</ref> ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Manufacturers\n|Alco, DLW\n|-\n|Engine\n|Alco 251-B, [[V16 engine|16 cylinder engine]], {{convert|2600|hp|abbr=on|lk=on}} ({{convert|2430|hp|abbr=on|disp=or}} site rating) with Alco 710/720/?? turbo supercharged engine. 1,000 rpm max, 400 rpm idle; {{convert|228|x|266|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} bore x stroke; compression ratio 12.5:1.

A version was adopted in 1849 following the invention of the [[Mini\u00e9 ball]]  in 1847 by the French Army captain [[Claude-\u00c9tienne Mini\u00e9]] of the [[Chasseurs]] d'[[Orl\u00e9ans]] and [[Henri-Gustave Delvigne]]. The bullet was designed to allow rapid [[Muzzleloader|muzzle loading]] of rifles, and was an innovation that brought about the widespread use of the rifle as the main battlefield weapon for individual soldiers.  The French adopted it following difficulties encountered by the French army in Northern Africa, where their muskets were outranged by long-barreled weapons which were handcrafted by their Algerian opponents.

When fired, the expanding gas forcibly pushed on the base of the bullet, deforming it to engage the rifling. This provided spin for accuracy, a better seal for consistent velocity and longer range, and cleaning of barrel detritus.\n\nBefore this [[innovation]], the [[smoothbore]] [[musket]] commonly using the [[buck and ball]] was the only practical field weapon. Rifled muskets had been in use since the [[Renaissance]], but they required hammering projectiles with a ramrod and mallet into the bore of the barrel, and also created considerable cleaning problems. The short-lived \"[[carabine \u00e0 tige]]\" system used a pin at the bottom of the barrel which deformed the bullet against the wall of the barrel when the bullet was pushed to the bottom. This system was very problematic for cleaning, especially with the black powders of the period.\n\nThe Mini\u00e9 rifle used a [[percussion lock]] and weighed 10 lb 9 oz (4.8&nbsp;kg). Having a reasonable accuracy up to 600 yards (550 metres), it was equipped with sights for effective aiming. The hollow-based bullet was of .702 inch (17.8&nbsp;mm) calibre, and weighed 500 grains (32.4 g). It could penetrate 4 inches (10&nbsp;cm) of soft pine at 1,000 yards (918 m).\n\nA test in [[Vincennes]] in 1849 demonstrated that at 15 yards the bullet was able to penetrate two boards of poplar wood, each two-thirds of an inch thick and separated by 20 inches. Soldiers of the time spread rumors that at 1,200 yards the bullet could penetrate a soldier and his knapsack and still kill anyone standing behind him, even killing every person in a line of 15.\n\nThe Mini\u00e9 rifle saw limited distribution in the [[Crimean War]] and similar rifles using Mini\u00e9 bullets (such as the [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]], the [[Springfield Model 1861]] and the [[Lorenz rifle]]) were the dominant infantry weapons in the [[American Civil War]]. The large-caliber, easily deformed conical lead bullets, ranging in diameter from .54 to .58 inches (14-18mm), combined with the high-speed spin from the rifling, created terrible wounds.\n\n==Use==\nThe Pattern 1851 Mini\u00e9 rifle was in use by the [[British Army]] from 1851 to 1855. The Mini\u00e9 system was also used extensively by various manufacturers, such as [[Springfield Armory|Springfield]] (the [[Springfield Model 1861]]) and [[Royal Small Arms Factory|Enfield]] (the [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]]).\n\nMini\u00e9 rifles were also used extensively in the [[Boshin War]] (1868\u20131869) in Japan, where they had an important role in tipping the balance against the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] forces in encounters such as the [[Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi]].\n\n==Obsolescence==\nThe muzzle-loading Mini\u00e9 rifle became obsolete in 1866 following the [[Austro-Prussian War|defeat of the Austrians]], equipped with this type of rifle, against the Prussians, who had the innovative bolt-action [[Dreyse needle gun|Dreyse]] rifles. In France, the existing Mini\u00e9 rifles were then retooled to accommodate a breech-loading mechanism reminiscent of a [[snuff box]], and became known as [[Tabati\u00e8re rifle|Tabati\u00e8re (snuff-box) rifles]].

A version was adopted in 1849 following the invention of the [[Mini\u00e9 ball]]  in 1847 by the French Army captain [[Claude-\u00c9tienne Mini\u00e9]] of the [[Chasseurs]] d'[[Orl\u00e9ans]] and [[Henri-Gustave Delvigne]]. The bullet was designed to allow rapid [[Muzzleloader|muzzle loading]] of rifles, and was an innovation that brought about the widespread use of the rifle as the main battlefield weapon for individual soldiers.  The French adopted it following difficulties encountered by the French army in Northern Africa, where their muskets were outranged by long-barreled weapons which were handcrafted by their Algerian opponents.

What do you think? (7 April 1770{{snd}}23 April 1850) was an English [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poet who, with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], helped to launch the [[Romanticism|Romantic Age]] in [[English literature]] with their joint publication ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' (1798).\n\nWordsworth's ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' is generally considered to be ''[[The Prelude]]'', a semi-autobiographical poem of his early years that he revised and expanded a number of times. It was posthumously titled and published by his wife in the year of his death, before which it was generally known as \"the poem to Coleridge\".<ref>e g Dorothy Wordsworth's ''Journal'' 26 December 1801</ref> \n\nWordsworth was Britain's [[poet laureate]] from 1843 until his death from [[pleurisy]] on 23 April 1850.<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/OfficialRoyalposts/PoetLaureate.aspx \"Poet Laureate\"], The British Monarchy official website.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of William Wordsworth}}\n\nThe second of five children born to John Wordsworth and Ann Cookson, William Wordsworth was born on 7 April 1770 in what is now named [[Wordsworth House]] in [[Cockermouth]], Cumberland,<ref>{{NHLE |num=1327088 |desc=Wordsworth House |accessdate=21 December 2009}}</ref> part of the scenic region in northwestern England known as the [[Lake District]]. William's sister, the poet and diarist [[Dorothy Wordsworth]], to whom he was close all his life, was born the following year, and the two were baptised together. They had three other siblings: Richard, the eldest, who became a lawyer; John, born after Dorothy, who went to sea and died in 1805 when the ship of which he was captain, the ''[[Earl of Abergavenny (1796 EIC ship)|Earl of Abergavenny]]'', was wrecked off the south coast of England; and [[Christopher Wordsworth (divine)|Christopher]], the youngest, who entered the Church and rose to be Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>Appendix A (Past Governors) of Allport, D. H., & N. J. Friskney, ''A Short History of Wilson's School'', Wilson's School Charitable Trust, 1986.</ref>\n\nWordsworth's father was a legal representative of [[James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale]] and, through his connections, lived in a large mansion in the small town. He was frequently away from home on business, so the young William and his siblings had little involvement with him and remained distant from him until his death in 1783.<ref>Moorman 1968 pp. 5\u20137.</ref> However, he did encourage William in his reading, and in particular set him to commit large portions of verse to memory, including works by [[John Milton|Milton]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]. William was also allowed to use his father's library.\nWilliam also spent time at his mother's parents' house in [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]], Cumberland, where he was exposed to the moors, but did not get along with his grandparents or his uncle, who also lived there. His hostile interactions with them distressed him to the point of contemplating suicide.<ref>Moorman 1968:9\u201313.</ref>\n\nWordsworth was taught to read by his mother and attended, first, a tiny school of low quality in Cockermouth, then a school in Penrith for the children of upper-class families, where he was taught by Ann Birkett, who insisted on instilling in her students traditions that included pursuing both scholarly and local activities, especially the festivals around Easter, May Day and [[Shrove Tuesday]]. Wordsworth was taught both the Bible and the ''[[The Spectator (1711)|Spectator]]'', but little else. It was at the school in Penrith that he met the Hutchinsons, including Mary, who later became his wife.<ref>Moorman 1968:15\u201318.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Wordsworth's mother, in 1778, his father sent him to [[Hawkshead Grammar School]] in [[Lancashire]] (now in [[Cumbria]]) and sent Dorothy to live with relatives in [[Yorkshire]]. She and William did not meet again for another nine years.\n\nWordsworth made his debut as a writer in 1787 when he published a sonnet in ''[[The European Magazine]]''. That same year he began attending [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. He received his BA degree in 1791.<ref>{{acad|id=WRDT787W|name=Wordsworth, William}}</ref> He returned to Hawkshead for the first two summers of his time at Cambridge, and often spent later holidays on [[Hiking#Walking tours today|walking tours]], visiting places famous for the beauty of their [[landscape]]. In 1790 he went on a walking tour of Europe, during which he toured the [[Alps]] extensively, and visited nearby areas of France, Switzerland, and Italy.<ref name=\"Bennett2015\">{{cite book|author=Andrew Bennett|title=William Wordsworth in Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPtDBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA191|date=12 February 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-02841-8|page=191}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship with Annette Vallon==\nIn November 1791, Wordsworth visited [[Revolutionary France]] and became enchanted with the Republican movement. He fell in love with a French woman, Annette Vallon, who, in 1792, gave birth to their daughter Caroline. Financial problems and [[Great Britain|Britain]]'s tense relations with France forced him to return to England alone the following year.<ref name=webbio>Everett, Glenn, [http://www.victorianweb.org/previctorian/ww/bio.html \"William Wordsworth: Biography\"] at The Victorian Web, accessed 7 January 2007.</ref> The circumstances of his return and his subsequent behaviour raised doubts as to his declared wish to marry Annette. However, he supported her and his daughter as best he could in later life. The [[Reign of Terror]] left Wordsworth thoroughly disillusioned with the French Revolution and the outbreak of armed hostilities between Britain and France prevented him from seeing Annette and his daughter for some years.\n\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]] again allowing travel to France, in 1802 Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy visited Annette and Caroline in [[Calais]]. The purpose of the visit was to prepare Annette for the fact of his forthcoming marriage to Mary Hutchinson.<ref name=webbio/> Afterwards he wrote the sonnet \"[[It is a beauteous evening, calm and free]],\" recalling a seaside walk with the 9-year-old Caroline, whom he had never seen before that visit. Mary was anxious that Wordsworth should do more for Caroline. Upon Caroline's marriage, in 1816, Wordsworth settled \u00a330 a year on her (equivalent to \u00a31,360 as of the year 2000), payments which continued until 1835, when they were replaced by a capital settlement.<ref>Gill (1989) pp. 208, 299</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1245 to Present|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/ppoweruk/|publisher=MeasuringWorth.com|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==First publication and ''Lyrical Ballads''==\n[[File:William Wordsworth at 28 by William Shuter2.jpg|thumb|right|Wordsworth in 1798, about the time he began ''[[The Prelude]]''.<ref>\"[http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/collections/wordsworth.html The Cornell Wordsworth Collection]\". [[Cornell University]]. Retrieved 13 February 2009.</ref>]] The year 1793 saw the first publication of poems by Wordsworth, in the collections ''An Evening Walk'' and ''Descriptive Sketches''. In 1795 he received a legacy of \u00a3900 from Raisley Calvert and became able to pursue a career as a poet.\n\nIt was also in 1795 that he met [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] in Somerset. The two poets quickly developed a close friendship. For two years from 1795, William and his sister Dorothy lived at Racedown House in Dorset\u2014a property of the Pinney family\u2014to the west of [[Pilsdon Pen]]. They walked in the area for about two hours every day, and the nearby hills consoled Dorothy as she pined for the fells of her native Lakeland. She wrote,\n<blockquote>\"We have hills which, seen from a distance almost take the character of mountains, some cultivated nearly to their summits, others in their wild state covered with furze and broom. These delight me the most as they remind me of our native wilds.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Dorset Villages|author=Roland Gant|publisher=Robert Hale Ltd|pages=111\u2013112|year=1980|isbn=0 7091 8135 3}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1797, the pair moved to [[Alfoxton House]], Somerset, just a few miles away from Coleridge's home in [[Nether Stowey]]. Together Wordsworth and Coleridge (with insights from Dorothy) produced ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' (1798), an important work in the English [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]].<ref>{{Cite book |year=1798 |title=Lyricall Ballads: With a Few Other Poems    |edition=1 |publisher=  J. & A.

Wordsworth also gives his famous definition of poetry as \"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility\", and calls his own poems in the book \"experimental\". A fourth and final edition of ''Lyrical Ballads'' was published in 1805.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wordsworth |first= William |year=1805 |title=Lyrical Ballads with Pastoral and other Poems |edition=4 |publisher=Printed for Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, by R.

He attempted to get the play staged in November 1797, but it was rejected by [[Thomas Harris (theatre manager)|Thomas Harris]], the manager of the [[Covent Garden Theatre]], who proclaimed it \"impossible that the play should succeed in the representation\". The rebuff was not received lightly by Wordsworth and the play was not published until 1842, after substantial revision.<ref>Stephen Gill, ''William Wordsworth: A Life'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1989, pp. 132\u2013133.</ref>\n\n==Germany and move to the Lake District==\nWordsworth, Dorothy and Coleridge travelled to Germany in the autumn of 1798. While Coleridge was intellectually stimulated by the journey, its main effect on Wordsworth was to produce homesickness.<ref name=webbio/> During the harsh winter of 1798\u201399 Wordsworth lived with Dorothy in [[Goslar]], and, despite extreme stress and loneliness, began work on the autobiographical piece that was later titled ''The Prelude''. He wrote a number of other famous poems in Goslar, including \"[[The Lucy poems]]\". In the Autumn of 1799, Wordsworth and his sister returned to England and visited the Hutchinson family at Sockburn. When Coleridge arrived back in England he travelled to the North with their publisher Joseph Cottle to meet Wordsworth and undertake a proposed tour of the Lake District. This was the immediate cause of the brother and sister's settling at [[Dove Cottage]] in [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]] in the Lake District, this time with another poet, [[Robert Southey]], nearby. Wordsworth, Coleridge and Southey came to be known as the \"[[Lake Poets]]\".<ref>''[[Recollections of the Lake Poets]]''.</ref> Throughout this period many of Wordsworth's poems revolved around themes of death, endurance, separation and grief.\n\n==Marriage and children==\n[[File:Dove Cottage - geograph.org.uk - 70618.jpg|thumb|[[Dove Cottage]] (Town End, Grasmere) \u2013 home of William and Dorothy Wordsworth, 1799\u20131808; home of [[Thomas De Quincey]], 1809\u20131820]]\nIn 1802, Lowther's heir, [[William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale]], paid the \u00a34,000 owed to Wordsworth's father through Lowther's failure to pay his aide.<ref>Moorman 1968 p. 8</ref> It was this repayment that afforded Wordsworth the financial means to marry. On 4 October, following his visit with Dorothy to France to arrange matters with Annette, Wordsworth married his childhood friend Mary Hutchinson.<ref name=\"webbio\"/> Dorothy continued to live with the couple and grew close to Mary. The following year Mary gave birth to the first of five children, three of whom predeceased her and William:\n\n*John Wordsworth (18 June 1803{{snd}}1875). Married four times:\n*#Isabella Curwen (died 1848) had six children: Jane, Henry, William, John, Charles and Edward.\n*#Helen Ross (died 1854).

Married Fanny Graham and had four children: Mary Louisa, William, Reginald, Gordon\n\n==Autobiographical work and ''Poems, in Two Volumes''==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}\nWordsworth had for years been making plans to write a long philosophical poem in three parts, which he intended to call ''The Recluse''. In 1798\u201399 he started an autobiographical poem, which he referred to as the \"[[The Prelude|poem to Coleridge]]\" and which he planned would serve as an appendix to a larger work called ''The Recluse''. In 1804 he began expanding this autobiographical work, having decided to make it a prologue rather than an appendix. He completed this work, now generally referred to as the first version of ''[[The Prelude]]'', in 1805, but refused to publish such a personal work until he had completed the whole of ''The Recluse''. The death of his brother John, also in 1805, affected him strongly and may have influenced his decisions about these works.\n[[File:Rydal Mount - geograph.org.uk - 959824.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rydal Mount]] \u2013 home to Wordsworth 1813\u20131850. Hundreds of visitors came here to see him over the years]]\nWordsworth's philosophical allegiances as articulated in ''[[The Prelude]]'' and in such shorter works as \"[[Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey]]\" have been a source of critical debate. It was long supposed that Wordsworth relied chiefly on Coleridge for philosophical guidance, but more recently scholars have suggested that Wordsworth's ideas may have been formed years before he and Coleridge became friends in the mid-1790s. In particular, while he was in revolutionary Paris in 1792, the 22-year-old Wordsworth made the acquaintance of the mysterious traveler [[John \"Walking\" Stewart]] (1747\u20131822),<ref>[[Kelly Grovier]], \"Dream Walker: A Wordsworth Mystery Solved\", ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', 16 February 2007</ref> who was nearing the end of his thirty years of wandering, on foot, from [[Madras]], India, through [[Persia]] and [[Arabia]], across Africa and Europe, and up through the fledgling United States. By the time of their association, Stewart had published an ambitious work of original materialist philosophy entitled ''The Apocalypse of Nature'' (London, 1791), to which many of Wordsworth's philosophical sentiments may well be indebted.\n\nIn 1807 Wordsworth published ''[[Poems, in Two Volumes]]'', including \"[[Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood]]\". Up to this point Wordsworth was known only for ''Lyrical Ballads'', and he hoped that this new collection would cement his reputation. Its reception was lukewarm, however.\n\nIn 1810, Wordsworth and Coleridge were estranged over the latter's opium addiction,<ref name=webbio/> and in 1812, his son Thomas died at the age of 6, six months after the death of 3-year-old Catherine. The following year he received an appointment as Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland, and the stipend of \u00a3400 a year made him financially secure, albeit at the cost of political independence. In 1813, he and his family, including Dorothy, moved to [[Rydal Mount]], [[Ambleside]] (between Grasmere and Rydal Water), where he spent the rest of his life.<ref name=webbio/>\n\n==The Prospectus==\nIn 1814 Wordsworth published ''[[The Excursion]]'' as the second part of the three-part work ''The Recluse'', even though he had not completed the first part or the third part, and never did. He did, however, write a poetic Prospectus to ''The Recluse'' in which he laid out the structure and intention of the whole work. The Prospectus contains some of Wordsworth's most famous lines on the relation between the human mind and nature:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\n                      ... my voice proclaims\nHow exquisitely the individual Mind\n(And the progressive powers perhaps no less\nOf the whole species) to the external World\nIs fitted:{{mdash}}and how exquisitely, too{{mdash}}\nTheme this but little heard of among Men,\nThe external World is fitted to the Mind;\nAnd the creation (by no lower name\nCan it be called) which they with blended might\nAccomplish ...<ref>{{cite book|title=Poetical Works|location=London|publisher=Oxford U.P.|date=1936|series=Oxford Standard Authors|page=590}}</ref></poem>}}\n\nSome modern critics<ref>{{Cite book|title = Wordsworth's Poetry, 1787\u20131814|last = Hartman|first = Geoffrey|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 1987|isbn = 9780674958210|location = New Haven|pages = 329\u2013331}}</ref> suggest that there was a decline in his work beginning around the mid-1810s, perhaps because most of the concerns that characterised his early poems (loss, death, endurance, separation and abandonment) had been resolved in his writings and his life.<ref>Already in 1891 [[James Kenneth Stephen]] wrote satirically of Wordsworth having \"two voices\":  one is \"of the deep\", the other \"of an old half-witted sheep/Which bleats articulate monotony\".</ref> By 1820, he was enjoying considerable success accompanying a reversal in the contemporary critical opinion of his earlier works.\n\nFollowing the death of his friend the painter [[William Green (painter)|William Green]] in 1823, Wordsworth also mended his relations with Coleridge.<ref>Sylvanus Urban, ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', 1823</ref> The two were fully reconciled by 1828, when they toured the [[Rhineland]] together.<ref name=webbio/> Dorothy suffered from a severe illness in 1829 that rendered her an invalid for the remainder of her life. Coleridge and [[Charles Lamb]] both died in 1834, their loss being a difficult blow to Wordsworth. The following year saw the passing of [[James Hogg]]. Despite the death of many contemporaries, the popularity of his poetry ensured a steady stream of young friends and admirers to replace those he lost.\n\n==Religious beliefs==\nWordsworth's youthful political radicalism, unlike Coleridge's, never led him to rebel against his religious upbringing. He remarked in 1812 that he was willing to shed his blood for the established [[Church of England]], reflected in his ''Ecclesiastical Sketches'' of 1822. This religious conservatism also colours ''[[The Excursion]]'' (1814), a long poem that became extremely popular during the nineteenth century; it features three central characters, the Wanderer; the Solitary, who has experienced the hopes and miseries of the [[French Revolution]]; and the Pastor, who dominates the last third of the poem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/previctorian/ww/religion1.html|title=Wordsworth's Religion|website=www.victorianweb.org}}</ref>\n\n==Laureateship and other honours==\nWordsworth remained a formidable presence in his later years. In 1837, the Scottish poet and playwright [[Joanna Baillie]] reflected on her long acquaintance with Wordsworth. \"He looks like a man that one must not speak to unless one has some sensible thing to say. However he does occasionally converse cheerfully & well; and when one knows how benevolent & excellent he is, it disposes one to be very much pleased with him.\"<ref name=\"Baillie2010\">{{cite book|last=Baillie|first=Joanna|editor=Thomas McLean|title=Further Letters of Joanna Baillie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17xLwZQppO4C&pg=PA22|year=2010|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|location=Madison, NJ|isbn=978-0-8386-4149-1|page=181}}</ref>\n\nIn 1838, Wordsworth received an honorary doctorate in Civil Law from the [[University of Durham]] and the following year he was awarded the same honorary degree by the University of Oxford, when [[John Keble]] praised him as the \"poet of humanity\", praise greatly appreciated by Wordsworth.<ref name=webbio/><ref>Gill, pp396-7</ref> (It has been argued that Wordsworth was a great influence on Keble's immensely popular book of devotional poetry, ''The Christian Year'' (1827).<ref>http://www.victorianweb.org/religion/herb4.html#ww1</ref>) In 1842, the government awarded him a Civil List pension of \u00a3300 a year.\n\nFollowing the death of Robert Southey in 1843 Wordsworth became [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]]. He initially refused the honour, saying that he was too old, but accepted when the Prime Minister, [[Robert Peel]], assured him that \"you shall have nothing required of you\". Wordsworth thus became the only poet laureate to write no official verses. The sudden death of his daughter Dora in 1847 at age 42 was difficult for the aging poet to take and in his depression, he completely gave up writing new material.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:WilliamWordsworth Grave.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Gravestone of William Wordsworth, [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], Cumbria]]\nWilliam Wordsworth died at home at Rydal Mount from an aggravated case of [[pleurisy]] on 23 April 1850,<ref>Stephen Gill, ''William Wordsworth: A Life'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1989, pp. 422\u20133.</ref> and was buried at [[St Oswald's Church, Grasmere]]. His widow, Mary, published his lengthy autobiographical \"Poem to Coleridge\" as ''[[The Prelude]]'' several months after his death. Though it failed to interest people at the time, it has since come to be widely recognised as his masterpiece.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nWordsworth has appeared as a character in works of fiction, including:\n*William Kinsolving \u2013 ''Mister Christian''. 1996\n*[[Jasper Fforde]] - ''The Eyre Affair''. 2001\n*[[Val McDermid]] \u2013 ''The Grave Tattoo''. 2006\n*\"The Wordsmiths at Gorsemere\" by Sue Limb. 2008\n\n[[Isaac Asimov]]'s 1966 [[Fantastic Voyage#Novelization|novelization]] of the 1966 film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' sees Dr. Peter Duval quoting Wordsworth's ''[[The Prelude]]'' as the miniaturized submarine sails through the cerebral fluid surrounding a human brain, comparing it to the \"strange seas of thought\".\n\n==Major works==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=27em|\n* ''[[Lyrical Ballads]], with a Few Other Poems'' (1798)\n** \"Simon Lee\"\n** \"[[We are Seven]]\"\n** \"[[Lines Written in Early Spring]]\"\n** \"[[Expostulation and Reply]]\"\n** \"[[The Tables Turned]]\"\n** \"The Thorn\"\n** \"[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Lines Composed A Few Miles above Tintern Abbey]]\"\n* ''[[Lyrical Ballads]], with Other Poems'' (1800) {{Dubious|date=January 2018}}\n** [[Preface to the Lyrical Ballads]]\n** \"[[Strange fits of passion have I known]]\"<ref name=Lucy>M.

English [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poet who, with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], helped to launch the [[Romanticism|Romantic Age]] in [[English literature]] with their joint publication ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' (1798).\n\nWordsworth's ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' is generally considered to be ''[[The Prelude]]'', a semi-autobiographical poem of his early years that he revised and expanded a number of times. It was posthumously titled and published by his wife in the year of his death, before which it was generally known as \"the poem to Coleridge\".<ref>e g Dorothy Wordsworth's ''Journal'' 26 December 1801</ref> \n\nWordsworth was Britain's [[poet laureate]] from 1843 until his death from [[pleurisy]] on 23 April 1850.<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/OfficialRoyalposts/PoetLaureate.aspx \"Poet Laureate\"], The British Monarchy official website.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of William Wordsworth}}\n\nThe second of five children born to John Wordsworth and Ann Cookson, William Wordsworth was born on 7 April 1770 in what is now named [[Wordsworth House]] in [[Cockermouth]], Cumberland,<ref>{{NHLE |num=1327088 |desc=Wordsworth House |accessdate=21 December 2009}}</ref> part of the scenic region in northwestern England known as the [[Lake District]]. William's sister, the poet and diarist [[Dorothy Wordsworth]], to whom he was close all his life, was born the following year, and the two were baptised together. They had three other siblings: Richard, the eldest, who became a lawyer; John, born after Dorothy, who went to sea and died in 1805 when the ship of which he was captain, the ''[[Earl of Abergavenny (1796 EIC ship)|Earl of Abergavenny]]'', was wrecked off the south coast of England; and [[Christopher Wordsworth (divine)|Christopher]], the youngest, who entered the Church and rose to be Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>Appendix A (Past Governors) of Allport, D. H., & N. J. Friskney, ''A Short History of Wilson's School'', Wilson's School Charitable Trust, 1986.</ref>\n\nWordsworth's father was a legal representative of [[James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale]] and, through his connections, lived in a large mansion in the small town. He was frequently away from home on business, so the young William and his siblings had little involvement with him and remained distant from him until his death in 1783.<ref>Moorman 1968 pp. 5\u20137.</ref> However, he did encourage William in his reading, and in particular set him to commit large portions of verse to memory, including works by [[John Milton|Milton]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]. William was also allowed to use his father's library.\nWilliam also spent time at his mother's parents' house in [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]], Cumberland, where he was exposed to the moors, but did not get along with his grandparents or his uncle, who also lived there. His hostile interactions with them distressed him to the point of contemplating suicide.<ref>Moorman 1968:9\u201313.</ref>\n\nWordsworth was taught to read by his mother and attended, first, a tiny school of low quality in Cockermouth, then a school in Penrith for the children of upper-class families, where he was taught by Ann Birkett, who insisted on instilling in her students traditions that included pursuing both scholarly and local activities, especially the festivals around Easter, May Day and [[Shrove Tuesday]]. Wordsworth was taught both the Bible and the ''[[The Spectator (1711)|Spectator]]'', but little else. It was at the school in Penrith that he met the Hutchinsons, including Mary, who later became his wife.<ref>Moorman 1968:15\u201318.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Wordsworth's mother, in 1778, his father sent him to [[Hawkshead Grammar School]] in [[Lancashire]] (now in [[Cumbria]]) and sent Dorothy to live with relatives in [[Yorkshire]]. She and William did not meet again for another nine years.\n\nWordsworth made his debut as a writer in 1787 when he published a sonnet in ''[[The European Magazine]]''. That same year he began attending [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. He received his BA degree in 1791.<ref>{{acad|id=WRDT787W|name=Wordsworth, William}}</ref> He returned to Hawkshead for the first two summers of his time at Cambridge, and often spent later holidays on [[Hiking#Walking tours today|walking tours]], visiting places famous for the beauty of their [[landscape]]. In 1790 he went on a walking tour of Europe, during which he toured the [[Alps]] extensively, and visited nearby areas of France, Switzerland, and Italy.<ref name=\"Bennett2015\">{{cite book|author=Andrew Bennett|title=William Wordsworth in Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPtDBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA191|date=12 February 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-02841-8|page=191}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship with Annette Vallon==\nIn November 1791, Wordsworth visited [[Revolutionary France]] and became enchanted with the Republican movement. He fell in love with a French woman, Annette Vallon, who, in 1792, gave birth to their daughter Caroline. Financial problems and [[Great Britain|Britain]]'s tense relations with France forced him to return to England alone the following year.<ref name=webbio>Everett, Glenn, [http://www.victorianweb.org/previctorian/ww/bio.html \"William Wordsworth: Biography\"] at The Victorian Web, accessed 7 January 2007.</ref> The circumstances of his return and his subsequent behaviour raised doubts as to his declared wish to marry Annette. However, he supported her and his daughter as best he could in later life. The [[Reign of Terror]] left Wordsworth thoroughly disillusioned with the French Revolution and the outbreak of armed hostilities between Britain and France prevented him from seeing Annette and his daughter for some years.\n\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]] again allowing travel to France, in 1802 Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy visited Annette and Caroline in [[Calais]]. The purpose of the visit was to prepare Annette for the fact of his forthcoming marriage to Mary Hutchinson.<ref name=webbio/> Afterwards he wrote the sonnet \"[[It is a beauteous evening, calm and free]],\" recalling a seaside walk with the 9-year-old Caroline, whom he had never seen before that visit. Mary was anxious that Wordsworth should do more for Caroline. Upon Caroline's marriage, in 1816, Wordsworth settled \u00a330 a year on her (equivalent to \u00a31,360 as of the year 2000), payments which continued until 1835, when they were replaced by a capital settlement.<ref>Gill (1989) pp. 208, 299</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Purchasing Power of British Pounds from 1245 to Present|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/ppoweruk/|publisher=MeasuringWorth.com|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==First publication and ''Lyrical Ballads''==\n[[File:William Wordsworth at 28 by William Shuter2.jpg|thumb|right|Wordsworth in 1798, about the time he began ''[[The Prelude]]''.<ref>\"[http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/collections/wordsworth.html The Cornell Wordsworth Collection]\". [[Cornell University]]. Retrieved 13 February 2009.</ref>]] The year 1793 saw the first publication of poems by Wordsworth, in the collections ''An Evening Walk'' and ''Descriptive Sketches''. In 1795 he received a legacy of \u00a3900 from Raisley Calvert and became able to pursue a career as a poet.\n\nIt was also in 1795 that he met [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] in Somerset. The two poets quickly developed a close friendship. For two years from 1795, William and his sister Dorothy lived at Racedown House in Dorset\u2014a property of the Pinney family\u2014to the west of [[Pilsdon Pen]]. They walked in the area for about two hours every day, and the nearby hills consoled Dorothy as she pined for the fells of her native Lakeland. She wrote,\n<blockquote>\"We have hills which, seen from a distance almost take the character of mountains, some cultivated nearly to their summits, others in their wild state covered with furze and broom. These delight me the most as they remind me of our native wilds.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Dorset Villages|author=Roland Gant|publisher=Robert Hale Ltd|pages=111\u2013112|year=1980|isbn=0 7091 8135 3}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1797, the pair moved to [[Alfoxton House]], Somerset, just a few miles away from Coleridge's home in [[Nether Stowey]]. Together Wordsworth and Coleridge (with insights from Dorothy) produced ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' (1798), an important work in the English [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]].<ref>{{Cite book |year=1798 |title=Lyricall Ballads: With a Few Other Poems    |edition=1 |publisher=  J. & A.

One of Wordsworth's most famous poems, \"[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Tintern Abbey]]\", was published in this collection, along with Coleridge's \"[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]\".

Wordsworth also gives his famous definition of poetry as \"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility\", and calls his own poems in the book \"experimental\". A fourth and final edition of ''Lyrical Ballads'' was published in 1805.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wordsworth |first= William |year=1805 |title=Lyrical Ballads with Pastoral and other Poems |edition=4 |publisher=Printed for Longman, Hurst, Rees, and Orme, by R.

He attempted to get the play staged in November 1797, but it was rejected by [[Thomas Harris (theatre manager)|Thomas Harris]], the manager of the [[Covent Garden Theatre]], who proclaimed it \"impossible that the play should succeed in the representation\". The rebuff was not received lightly by Wordsworth and the play was not published until 1842, after substantial revision.<ref>Stephen Gill, ''William Wordsworth: A Life'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1989, pp. 132\u2013133.</ref>\n\n==Germany and move to the Lake District==\nWordsworth, Dorothy and Coleridge travelled to Germany in the autumn of 1798. While Coleridge was intellectually stimulated by the journey, its main effect on Wordsworth was to produce homesickness.<ref name=webbio/> During the harsh winter of 1798\u201399 Wordsworth lived with Dorothy in [[Goslar]], and, despite extreme stress and loneliness, began work on the autobiographical piece that was later titled ''The Prelude''. He wrote a number of other famous poems in Goslar, including \"[[The Lucy poems]]\". In the Autumn of 1799, Wordsworth and his sister returned to England and visited the Hutchinson family at Sockburn. When Coleridge arrived back in England he travelled to the North with their publisher Joseph Cottle to meet Wordsworth and undertake a proposed tour of the Lake District. This was the immediate cause of the brother and sister's settling at [[Dove Cottage]] in [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]] in the Lake District, this time with another poet, [[Robert Southey]], nearby. Wordsworth, Coleridge and Southey came to be known as the \"[[Lake Poets]]\".<ref>''[[Recollections of the Lake Poets]]''.</ref> Throughout this period many of Wordsworth's poems revolved around themes of death, endurance, separation and grief.\n\n==Marriage and children==\n[[File:Dove Cottage - geograph.org.uk - 70618.jpg|thumb|[[Dove Cottage]] (Town End, Grasmere) \u2013 home of William and Dorothy Wordsworth, 1799\u20131808; home of [[Thomas De Quincey]], 1809\u20131820]]\nIn 1802, Lowther's heir, [[William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale]], paid the \u00a34,000 owed to Wordsworth's father through Lowther's failure to pay his aide.<ref>Moorman 1968 p. 8</ref> It was this repayment that afforded Wordsworth the financial means to marry. On 4 October, following his visit with Dorothy to France to arrange matters with Annette, Wordsworth married his childhood friend Mary Hutchinson.<ref name=\"webbio\"/> Dorothy continued to live with the couple and grew close to Mary. The following year Mary gave birth to the first of five children, three of whom predeceased her and William:\n\n*John Wordsworth (18 June 1803{{snd}}1875).

Married Fanny Graham and had four children: Mary Louisa, William, Reginald, Gordon\n\n==Autobiographical work and ''Poems, in Two Volumes''==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}\nWordsworth had for years been making plans to write a long philosophical poem in three parts, which he intended to call ''The Recluse''. In 1798\u201399 he started an autobiographical poem, which he referred to as the \"[[The Prelude|poem to Coleridge]]\" and which he planned would serve as an appendix to a larger work called ''The Recluse''. In 1804 he began expanding this autobiographical work, having decided to make it a prologue rather than an appendix. He completed this work, now generally referred to as the first version of ''[[The Prelude]]'', in 1805, but refused to publish such a personal work until he had completed the whole of ''The Recluse''. The death of his brother John, also in 1805, affected him strongly and may have influenced his decisions about these works.\n[[File:Rydal Mount - geograph.org.uk - 959824.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rydal Mount]] \u2013 home to Wordsworth 1813\u20131850. Hundreds of visitors came here to see him over the years]]\nWordsworth's philosophical allegiances as articulated in ''[[The Prelude]]'' and in such shorter works as \"[[Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey]]\" have been a source of critical debate. It was long supposed that Wordsworth relied chiefly on Coleridge for philosophical guidance, but more recently scholars have suggested that Wordsworth's ideas may have been formed years before he and Coleridge became friends in the mid-1790s. In particular, while he was in revolutionary Paris in 1792, the 22-year-old Wordsworth made the acquaintance of the mysterious traveler [[John \"Walking\" Stewart]] (1747\u20131822),<ref>[[Kelly Grovier]], \"Dream Walker: A Wordsworth Mystery Solved\", ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', 16 February 2007</ref> who was nearing the end of his thirty years of wandering, on foot, from [[Madras]], India, through [[Persia]] and [[Arabia]], across Africa and Europe, and up through the fledgling United States. By the time of their association, Stewart had published an ambitious work of original materialist philosophy entitled ''The Apocalypse of Nature'' (London, 1791), to which many of Wordsworth's philosophical sentiments may well be indebted.\n\nIn 1807 Wordsworth published ''[[Poems, in Two Volumes]]'', including \"[[Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood]]\". Up to this point Wordsworth was known only for ''Lyrical Ballads'', and he hoped that this new collection would cement his reputation. Its reception was lukewarm, however.\n\nIn 1810, Wordsworth and Coleridge were estranged over the latter's opium addiction,<ref name=webbio/> and in 1812, his son Thomas died at the age of 6, six months after the death of 3-year-old Catherine. The following year he received an appointment as Distributor of Stamps for Westmorland, and the stipend of \u00a3400 a year made him financially secure, albeit at the cost of political independence. In 1813, he and his family, including Dorothy, moved to [[Rydal Mount]], [[Ambleside]] (between Grasmere and Rydal Water), where he spent the rest of his life.<ref name=webbio/>\n\n==The Prospectus==\nIn 1814 Wordsworth published ''[[The Excursion]]'' as the second part of the three-part work ''The Recluse'', even though he had not completed the first part or the third part, and never did. He did, however, write a poetic Prospectus to ''The Recluse'' in which he laid out the structure and intention of the whole work. The Prospectus contains some of Wordsworth's most famous lines on the relation between the human mind and nature:\n\n{{quote|<poem>\n                      ... my voice proclaims\nHow exquisitely the individual Mind\n(And the progressive powers perhaps no less\nOf the whole species) to the external World\nIs fitted:{{mdash}}and how exquisitely, too{{mdash}}\nTheme this but little heard of among Men,\nThe external World is fitted to the Mind;\nAnd the creation (by no lower name\nCan it be called) which they with blended might\nAccomplish ...<ref>{{cite book|title=Poetical Works|location=London|publisher=Oxford U.P.|date=1936|series=Oxford Standard Authors|page=590}}</ref></poem>}}\n\nSome modern critics<ref>{{Cite book|title = Wordsworth's Poetry, 1787\u20131814|last = Hartman|first = Geoffrey|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 1987|isbn = 9780674958210|location = New Haven|pages = 329\u2013331}}</ref> suggest that there was a decline in his work beginning around the mid-1810s, perhaps because most of the concerns that characterised his early poems (loss, death, endurance, separation and abandonment) had been resolved in his writings and his life.<ref>Already in 1891 [[James Kenneth Stephen]] wrote satirically of Wordsworth having \"two voices\":  one is \"of the deep\", the other \"of an old half-witted sheep/Which bleats articulate monotony\".</ref> By 1820, he was enjoying considerable success accompanying a reversal in the contemporary critical opinion of his earlier works.\n\nFollowing the death of his friend the painter [[William Green (painter)|William Green]] in 1823, Wordsworth also mended his relations with Coleridge.<ref>Sylvanus Urban, ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', 1823</ref> The two were fully reconciled by 1828, when they toured the [[Rhineland]] together.<ref name=webbio/> Dorothy suffered from a severe illness in 1829 that rendered her an invalid for the remainder of her life. Coleridge and [[Charles Lamb]] both died in 1834, their loss being a difficult blow to Wordsworth. The following year saw the passing of [[James Hogg]]. Despite the death of many contemporaries, the popularity of his poetry ensured a steady stream of young friends and admirers to replace those he lost.\n\n==Religious beliefs==\nWordsworth's youthful political radicalism, unlike Coleridge's, never led him to rebel against his religious upbringing. He remarked in 1812 that he was willing to shed his blood for the established [[Church of England]], reflected in his ''Ecclesiastical Sketches'' of 1822. This religious conservatism also colours ''[[The Excursion]]'' (1814), a long poem that became extremely popular during the nineteenth century; it features three central characters, the Wanderer; the Solitary, who has experienced the hopes and miseries of the [[French Revolution]]; and the Pastor, who dominates the last third of the poem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/previctorian/ww/religion1.html|title=Wordsworth's Religion|website=www.victorianweb.org}}</ref>\n\n==Laureateship and other honours==\nWordsworth remained a formidable presence in his later years. In 1837, the Scottish poet and playwright [[Joanna Baillie]] reflected on her long acquaintance with Wordsworth. \"He looks like a man that one must not speak to unless one has some sensible thing to say. However he does occasionally converse cheerfully & well; and when one knows how benevolent & excellent he is, it disposes one to be very much pleased with him.\"<ref name=\"Baillie2010\">{{cite book|last=Baillie|first=Joanna|editor=Thomas McLean|title=Further Letters of Joanna Baillie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17xLwZQppO4C&pg=PA22|year=2010|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|location=Madison, NJ|isbn=978-0-8386-4149-1|page=181}}</ref>\n\nIn 1838, Wordsworth received an honorary doctorate in Civil Law from the [[University of Durham]] and the following year he was awarded the same honorary degree by the University of Oxford, when [[John Keble]] praised him as the \"poet of humanity\", praise greatly appreciated by Wordsworth.<ref name=webbio/><ref>Gill, pp396-7</ref> (It has been argued that Wordsworth was a great influence on Keble's immensely popular book of devotional poetry, ''The Christian Year'' (1827).<ref>http://www.victorianweb.org/religion/herb4.html#ww1</ref>) In 1842, the government awarded him a Civil List pension of \u00a3300 a year.\n\nFollowing the death of Robert Southey in 1843 Wordsworth became [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]]. He initially refused the honour, saying that he was too old, but accepted when the Prime Minister, [[Robert Peel]], assured him that \"you shall have nothing required of you\". Wordsworth thus became the only poet laureate to write no official verses. The sudden death of his daughter Dora in 1847 at age 42 was difficult for the aging poet to take and in his depression, he completely gave up writing new material.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:WilliamWordsworth Grave.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Gravestone of William Wordsworth, [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]], Cumbria]]\nWilliam Wordsworth died at home at Rydal Mount from an aggravated case of [[pleurisy]] on 23 April 1850,<ref>Stephen Gill, ''William Wordsworth: A Life'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1989, pp. 422\u20133.</ref> and was buried at [[St Oswald's Church, Grasmere]]. His widow, Mary, published his lengthy autobiographical \"Poem to Coleridge\" as ''[[The Prelude]]'' several months after his death. Though it failed to interest people at the time, it has since come to be widely recognised as his masterpiece.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nWordsworth has appeared as a character in works of fiction, including:\n*William Kinsolving \u2013 ''Mister Christian''. 1996\n*[[Jasper Fforde]] - ''The Eyre Affair''. 2001\n*[[Val McDermid]] \u2013 ''The Grave Tattoo''. 2006\n*\"The Wordsmiths at Gorsemere\" by Sue Limb. 2008\n\n[[Isaac Asimov]]'s 1966 [[Fantastic Voyage#Novelization|novelization]] of the 1966 film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' sees Dr. Peter Duval quoting Wordsworth's ''[[The Prelude]]'' as the miniaturized submarine sails through the cerebral fluid surrounding a human brain, comparing it to the \"strange seas of thought\".\n\n==Major works==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=27em|\n* ''[[Lyrical Ballads]], with a Few Other Poems'' (1798)\n** \"Simon Lee\"\n** \"[[We are Seven]]\"\n** \"[[Lines Written in Early Spring]]\"\n** \"[[Expostulation and Reply]]\"\n** \"[[The Tables Turned]]\"\n** \"The Thorn\"\n** \"[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Lines Composed A Few Miles above Tintern Abbey]]\"\n* ''[[Lyrical Ballads]], with Other Poems'' (1800) {{Dubious|date=January 2018}}\n** [[Preface to the Lyrical Ballads]]\n** \"[[Strange fits of passion have I known]]\"<ref name=Lucy>M.

Rei ends up taking Eijun to see one of Chris rehab practices and reveals he is the only man Miyuki has never beaten.

Unknown to everyone, the Coach arranges three practice games for the weekend to see how everyone will do at maximum fatigue. Sawamura and Furuya are scheduled to pitch the game held on Saturday, while Tanba and Kawakami are scheduled to do Sunday's double header. After practice Furuya and Eijun find themselves called into Miyuki's room. Upon entering they see all the varsity team upper classman relaxing. At first Eijun thinks they are going to beat him for taking Chris's roster spot, but Miyuki's motive is to get the two freshmen pitchers to spend time with the upper classmen who will be fielding behind them. As Day 5 hits Sawamura and Furuya are sent into the bullpen to pitch and told they will pitch both batting practice and in the bullpen on Day 6 to get ready for their game on Day 7.

However because his previous team was weak, he is used to such situations and quickly begins to adjust.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = Ace of Diamond (season 1)\n| EpisodeNumber       = 18\n| Title               = I Hate It, But...\n| TranslitTitle       = Mukatsuku kedo\n| NativeTitle         = \u30e0\u30ab\u3064\u304f\u3051\u3069\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy          = Akira Shimizu\n| WrittenBy           = Junichi Fujisaku\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2014|2|9}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/program/detail/22856_201402090830.html|script-title=ja:\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u306e\uff21\u300c\u3080\u304b\u3064\u304f\u3051\u3069\u300d|date=|publisher=TV Tokyo|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary        = Miyuki continues to try to get Sawamura to pitch inside and gain additional control, but his motivational speeches seem to have little to no effect on Sawamura.

Kawakami pitches the game vs. Inashiro Industrial with Miyauchi while Tanba is forced to work with Miyuki. None of the starters play in the match vs. Inashiro Industrial, though Furuya is positioned in left field for the entire game. Inashiro Industrial brings out their starters for the second game, including southpaw ace Narumiya Mei. Mei already has a wicked slider, curve ball, and fast ball, but in the game he debuts a change up pitch that could make him unbeatable. Finally we start the Shuuhoku vs. Seidou match.

Everyone that sticks around gets to watch Sawamura work on his inside control with Kanemaru in the batting circle. The next day the reporters head to Akikawa where they are shocked to see Yeung is the pitcher for the practice sessions.

At first Sawamura pitches the ball straight down the middle, but a throwback from Miyuki makes Sawamura remember it is a team game and not a one-on-one contest. Sawamura is able to trick Raichi and get him behind with some outside pitches into a 1-2 count. Finally Sawamura unleashes his 4-seam fastball to the inside and gets Raichi to pop out.

Seeing no other choice, Raizou recommends they each get two strikes to get used to the speed of his pitch before swinging. The #8 man gets on base. Then the #9 batter calls for a bunt, the first bunt Yakushi has made in the tournament. Raichi now comes up for his third at bat. A homerun will make it 5-3 and could ruin Seidou's momentum.

The foundation of the city of Winterberg was presumably carried out together with the cloister in [[K\u00fcstelberg]]. Here indicates a document of 1276 in which the rights are regulated in the town between archbishop and cloister. In this document a church is mentioned in Winterberg whose precursor presumably goes back till the time about 1225. \nThe city fortification seems to have granted in the 14th century first only very much restricted protection. The count [[von Waldeck]] conquered the town 1321. About 1357 Winterberg became destroyed by [[Gottfried IV. (Arnsberg)|Gottfried IV. von Arnsberg]] during his war with the Cologne archbishop [[Wilhelm von Gennep]] . For the reconstruction the archbishop granted an at first ten-year-old tax freedom. This was extended in 1370 and 1374 in each case by other five years. At this time Winterberg owned the same town right like Hallenberg.\nWinterberg was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] from the 13th until the 17th century. The town was in the middle of two trade roads, [[Heidenstrasse]] between [[Cologne]] and [[Kassel]] and [[Heerstrasse]] between [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Soest, Germany|Soest]]. The bad agricultural conditions led to the fact that trade played a central role as a life basis of the town.\n\n===Deserted Medieval Town===\nBetween 1350 and 1500 the surrounding settlements village Wernsdorf, Merleheim, Haarfeld, G\u00fcnninghausen and Elkeringhausen were given up by her inhabitants. They often moved to Winterberg and they maintained her possession rights in her old land pieces. \nThe cause for give-up of the old settlements probably was due to the plague. The frequent feuds and lootings of this time was other cause. The towns offered a better protection against enemy troops. Only the cities of Winterberg, Hallenberg, Schmallenberg and Medebach were presumably settled at this time. The surrounding villages were presumably left completely.\n\n===Modern times till the end of Thirty Years' War (1500\u20131650)===\nBy the acquisition of region \"Marken\" the area of Winterberg strongly extended. There were similar trends in neighbouring towns. At the beginning of the 16th century Winterberg expanded her farmland in the area of Astenberg. Thereby they got during conflict with the count of von Waldeck who owned rights in the neighbouring village [[Nordenau]]. From southwest her territorial claims overlapped with the county Wittgenstein. This quarrel stretched with both opponents up to the end of the 18th century. In a comparison with Wittgenstein 1783 the debatable area was split.\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]] the neighbouring town Medebach and Hallenberg were 1634 destroyed by Hessian troops. Both had to suffer very much from contributions, lootings and murders. Besides, still the plague broke out soon afterwards. Both towns thereby had to register big population losses. This destiny seems to have remained saved to the city of Winterberg to a great extent. An important clue for this is that in 1638/39 the town council could buy a new organ for 240 imperial talers. Vice versa this could be the trigger for a vain siege of the town about 1640. The Winterberger shooters repulsed therefore attacking Hessen and Sweden successfully.\n\n===Witch hunts===\nAs in many other places in the [[Duchy of Westphalia]], between the 16th and 18th centuries, [[Witch-hunt|witch trials and executions]] took place in Winterberg. The exact number is unknown because the source material is extremely poor. Documented witch trials took place in 1523, probably 1562, 1629 and possibly 1728. On November 19, 1993 at the site of the \"Winterberger Halsgerichts\" a monument was opened as a memorial to the victims of the 16th century witch hunts.\n\n==Points of interest==\nThe second highest mountain of the [[Sauerland]], the ''[[Kahler Asten]]'' in the [[Rothaargebirge]], is located in the city area, which also contains the spring of the [[Lenne]] and [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] rivers.\n\n==Sport==\nThe city is one of the winter sports centers of the [[Sauerland]], best known probably for the [[Winterberg bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track|bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track]].
