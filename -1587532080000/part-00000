Stemming from a musical family, Luke's father Rick Steele is a local blues musician, and two of Luke's siblings are also musicians, with brother Jesse a former member of The Sleepy Jackson (and currently performing with father Rick in The Hot Biscuit Band), and sister [[Katy Steele|Katy]], who fronts another Perth rock band, [[Little Birdy]]. While a series of acclaimed EPs brought The Sleepy Jackson to a broader musical attention of Australia, it was the release of their 2003 album ''[[Lovers (The Sleepy Jackson album)|Lovers]]'' and 2006 second album ''[[Personality \u2013 One Was a Spider, One Was a Bird]]'' that directed significant international focus upon the band.\n\n==History==\n\n===''Miniskirt'' EP===\nThe Sleepy Jackson formed in 1998 with the original lineup featuring Luke Steele (vocals and guitars), Jesse Steele (drums), and Matthew O'Connor (bass). This lineup recorded a self-titled debut EP and a subsequent single titled \"Miniskirt.\" Both recordings were independently released. Dan Bull joined the lineup in 1999 as the band's first live keyboard player (who later played keys with [[Eskimo Joe]] at their live performances).\n\nIn 2000, as a result of non-musical commitments, Luke suggested that his brother should redirect his attentions and concentrate on other happenings in his life which ultimately resulted in Jesse following his advice and departing the band.\n\nThe void created by Jesse Steele's departure was filled by Paul Keenan (who later drummed with [[Eskimo Joe]] at their live performances). Along with numerous shows in their hometown of Perth, in late 2000 The Sleepy Jackson toured nationally with [[Jebediah]]. In March 2001, on the eve of the band's signing with [[EMI]] Records, the band toured with [[Magic Dirt]] and [[Motor Ace]] with Ronan Charles on keyboards joining Steele, O'Connor and Keenan. Five weeks into the tour, with the band broke, exhausted, and sleeping in caravan parks rather than enjoying the luxuries their touring partners were enjoying, O'Connor, Keenan and Charles quit, leaving Luke Steele to complete the tour solo.\n\n===EMI EPs===\nUpon signing to EMI, pressure was soon placed on Steele to produce a recording. The result was the 2001 EP titled ''Caffeine in the Morning Sun'', which Steele recorded in [[Sydney]] with a collection of session musicians. In addition to playing solo, Steele recruited drummer Malcolm Clark into The Sleepy Jackson fold and, when some serious touring was required in support of the release, the services of Justin Burford (guitar) and Rodney Aravena (bass) were enlisted. In addition to The Sleepy Jackson, Steele's three colleagues were also playing around their hometown with Jonathon Dudman under the name [[End of Fashion]].\n\nThe Sleepy Jackson relocated to Sydney, where they recorded another EP, ''Let Your Love Be Love'', in late 2002. Songs from this EP and ''Caffeine in the Morning Sun'' were compiled together to form a self-titled mini-album for release in the UK market in February 2003. A period of extensive touring quickly followed, which saw the band playing in Australia, the United States, and Europe. The latter brought the band some very enthusiastic attention from UK music magazine ''[[NME]]''.\n\n===''Lovers''===\nIn between live appearances, The Sleepy Jackson worked on recordings that were to become their debut album ''[[Lovers (The Sleepy Jackson album)|Lovers]]''. During a series of UK appearances in 2003, Burford and Aravena left the band. With a support slot for [[Silverchair]]'s ''[[Diorama (Silverchair album)|Diorama]]'' tour looming back in [[Australia]], replacements were quickly sought. Clarke called upon the only other [[End of Fashion]] member not previously part of The Sleepy Jackson, Jonathon Dudman.\n\nDudman joined the band in Sydney, where he took over bass duties, and the second guitarist position was filled by session musician Ben Nightingale. The Sleepy Jackson's revolving door continued when Nightingale was ultimately replaced by Jonathon Dudman's brother, Julian Dudman. But the Dudmans subsequently left the band, leaving Luke Steele and Malcolm Clark as the only official members of The Sleepy Jackson.\n\n===''Personality \u2013 One Was a Spider, One Was a Bird''===\nThe Sleepy Jackson released their second full-length album ''[[Personality \u2013 One Was a Spider, One Was a Bird]]'' in Australia on 1 July 2006, where it debuted at number 10 on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Albums Chart]] the following week. Later that July, the album was nominated for a [[J Award]] by Australian radio station [[Triple J]]. With ''Personality'''s predecessor ''Lovers'' also receiving generous support from both critics and radio alike, the band supported the new album's worldwide release with a series of live appearances in select markets. Joining Steele and Clark were Dave Symes and [[Felix Bloxsom]], who both worked on the album, and Lee Jones who was formerly in the Perth band [[Spencer Tracy (band)|Spencer Tracy]]. Bloxsom has since been replaced by Luke's brother Jake and Luke's wife Jodi, a.k.a. \"Snappy Dolphin,\" which also brought a change from organic percussion instruments to computer samples backing the band.\n\n===Touring===\nIn 2007, The Sleepy Jackson performed at the 2007 [[Big Day Out]], the [[Southbound (festival)|Southbound festival]], the [[Falls Festival]] and the St. Jerome's Laneway festivals in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]], [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]], and [[Brisbane, Queensland|Brisbane]]. Also in 2007, Steele provided slide guitar to the song \"Waiting All Day\" by [[Silverchair]] on their fifth album ''[[Young Modern]]''. Steele also appeared on the [[Pnau]] single \"With You Forever,\" leading [[Nick Littlemore]] to state on Pnau's website \"...working with Luke Steele... it was amazing, that inspired [me] to work on a separate project with him all together. It's another album we're doing.\"\n\n===Compilation albums===\nThe Sleepy Jackson were one of the artists contributing to [[Yoko Ono]]'s album [[Yes, I'm A Witch]], which was released in 2007 and is a compilation of remixed versions of Yoko's songs performed by various invited artists. The Sleepy Jackson contributed the remix of the song \"I'm Moving On\".<ref>[[Yes, I'm a Witch]]</ref>\n\n===2012 onwards===\nThe status of the band following the completion of touring for the second album is uncertain, with the band's official website no longer active.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to thesleepyjackson.com|url=http://www.thesleepyjackson.com/|work=www.thesleepyjackson.com|publisher=Network Advertising|accessdate=24 August 2012|author=Network Advertising|year=2012}}</ref> However, as of 2012, the band remains listed on the \"Artists\" page of the EMI Music website.<ref>{{cite web|title=Artists|url=http://www.emimusic.com/artists/#letterB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028122213/http://www.emimusic.com/artists/#letterB|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 October 2010|work=EMI Music|publisher=EMI Group Limited|accessdate=24 August 2012|author=EMI Music|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nIn late May 2013, as part of an interview for the second Empire of the Sun album ''Ice On The Dune'', Steele revealed that a third Sleepy Jackson album was heard by the band's record label but a lack of subsequent interest meant that it was never released.

Stemming from a musical family, Luke's father Rick Steele is a local blues musician, and two of Luke's siblings are also musicians, with brother Jesse a former member of The Sleepy Jackson (and currently performing with father Rick in The Hot Biscuit Band), and sister [[Katy Steele|Katy]], who fronts another Perth rock band, [[Little Birdy]]. While a series of acclaimed EPs brought The Sleepy Jackson to a broader musical attention of Australia, it was the release of their 2003 album ''[[Lovers (The Sleepy Jackson album)|Lovers]]'' and 2006 second album ''[[Personality \u2013 One Was a Spider, One Was a Bird]]'' that directed significant international focus upon the band.\n\n==History==\n\n===''Miniskirt'' EP===\nThe Sleepy Jackson formed in 1998 with the original lineup featuring Luke Steele (vocals and guitars), Jesse Steele (drums), and Matthew O'Connor (bass). This lineup recorded a self-titled debut EP and a subsequent single titled \"Miniskirt.\" Both recordings were independently released. Dan Bull joined the lineup in 1999 as the band\u2019s first live keyboard player (who later played keys with [[Eskimo Joe]] at their live performances).\n\nIn 2000, as a result of non-musical commitments, Luke suggested that his brother should redirect his attentions and concentrate on other happenings in his life which ultimately resulted in Jesse following his advice and departing the band.\n\nThe void created by Jesse Steele's departure was filled by Paul Keenan (who later drummed with [[Eskimo Joe]] at their live performances). Along with numerous shows in their hometown of Perth, in late 2000 The Sleepy Jackson toured nationally with [[Jebediah]]. In March 2001, on the eve of the band's signing with [[EMI]] Records, the band toured with [[Magic Dirt]] and [[Motor Ace]] with Ronan Charles on keyboards joining Steele, O'Connor and Keenan. Five weeks into the tour, with the band broke, exhausted, and sleeping in caravan parks rather than enjoying the luxuries their touring partners were enjoying, O'Connor, Keenan and Charles quit, leaving Luke Steele to complete the tour solo.\n\n===EMI EPs===\nUpon signing to EMI, pressure was soon placed on Steele to produce a recording. The result was the 2001 EP titled ''Caffeine in the Morning Sun'', which Steele recorded in [[Sydney]] with a collection of session musicians. In addition to playing solo, Steele recruited drummer Malcolm Clark into The Sleepy Jackson fold and, when some serious touring was required in support of the release, the services of Justin Burford (guitar) and Rodney Aravena (bass) were enlisted. In addition to The Sleepy Jackson, Steele's three colleagues were also playing around their hometown with Jonathon Dudman under the name [[End of Fashion]].\n\nThe Sleepy Jackson relocated to Sydney where they recorded another EP, ''Let Your Love Be Love'', in late 2002. Songs from this EP and ''Caffeine in the Morning Sun'' were compiled together to form a self-titled mini-album for release in the UK market in February 2003. A period of extensive touring quickly followed, which saw the band playing in Australia, the United States, and Europe. The latter brought the band some very enthusiastic attention from UK music magazine ''[[NME]]''.\n\n===''Lovers''===\nIn between live appearances, The Sleepy Jackson worked on recordings that were to become their debut album ''[[Lovers (The Sleepy Jackson album)|Lovers]]''. During a series of UK appearances in 2003, Burford and Aravena left the band. With a support slot for [[Silverchair]]'s ''[[Diorama (Silverchair album)|Diorama]]'' tour looming back in [[Australia]], replacements were quickly sought. Clarke called upon the only other [[End of Fashion]] member not previously part of The Sleepy Jackson, Jonathon Dudman.\n\nDudman joined the band in Sydney, where he took over bass duties, and the second guitarist position was filled by session musician Ben Nightingale. The Sleepy Jackson's revolving door continued when Nightingale was ultimately replaced by Jonathon Dudman's brother, Julian Dudman. But the Dudmans subsequently left the band, leaving Luke Steele and Malcolm Clark as the only official members of The Sleepy Jackson.\n\n===''Personality \u2013 One Was a Spider, One Was a Bird''===\nThe Sleepy Jackson released their second full-length album ''[[Personality \u2013 One Was a Spider, One Was a Bird]]'' in Australia on 1 July 2006, where it debuted at number 10 on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Albums Chart]] the following week. Later that July, the album was nominated for a [[J Award]] by Australian radio station [[Triple J]]. With ''Personality'''s predecessor ''Lovers'' also receiving generous support from both critics and radio alike, the band supported the new album's worldwide release with a series of live appearances in select markets. Joining Steele and Clark were Dave Symes and [[Felix Bloxsom]], who both worked on the album, and Lee Jones who was formerly in the Perth band [[Spencer Tracy (band)|Spencer Tracy]]. Bloxsom has since been replaced by Luke's brother Jake and Luke's wife Jodi, a.k.a. \"Snappy Dolphin,\" which also brought a change from organic percussion instruments to computer samples backing the band.\n\n===Touring===\nIn 2007, The Sleepy Jackson performed at the 2007 [[Big Day Out]], the [[Southbound (festival)|Southbound festival]], the [[Falls Festival]] and the St. Jerome's Laneway festivals in [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]], [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]], and [[Brisbane, Queensland|Brisbane]]. Also in 2007, Steele provided slide guitar to the song \"Waiting All Day\" by [[Silverchair]] on their fifth album ''[[Young Modern]]''. Steele also appeared on the [[Pnau]] single \"With You Forever,\" leading [[Nick Littlemore]] to state on Pnau's website \"...working with Luke Steele... it was amazing, that inspired [me] to work on a separate project with him all together. It's another album we're doing.\"\n\n===Compilation albums===\nThe Sleepy Jackson were one of the artists contributing to [[Yoko Ono]]'s album [[Yes, I'm A Witch]], which was released in 2007 and is a compilation of remixed versions of Yoko's songs performed by various invited artists. The Sleepy Jackson contributed the remix of the song \"I'm Moving On\".<ref>[[Yes, I'm a Witch]]</ref>\n\n===2012 onwards===\nThe status of the band following the completion of touring for the second album is uncertain, with the band's official website no longer active.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to thesleepyjackson.com|url=http://www.thesleepyjackson.com/|work=www.thesleepyjackson.com|publisher=Network Advertising|accessdate=24 August 2012|author=Network Advertising|year=2012}}</ref> However, as of 2012, the band remains listed on the \"Artists\" page of the EMI Music website.<ref>{{cite web|title=Artists|url=http://www.emimusic.com/artists/#letterB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028122213/http://www.emimusic.com/artists/#letterB|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 October 2010|work=EMI Music|publisher=EMI Group Limited|accessdate=24 August 2012|author=EMI Music|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nIn late May 2013, as part of an interview for the second Empire of the Sun album ''Ice On The Dune'', Steele revealed that a third Sleepy Jackson album was heard by the band's record label but a lack of subsequent interest meant that it was never released. As of 22 May 2013, Steele is focused on completing a collaboration with fellow Australian musician [[Daniel Johns]] and promotion for ''Ice On The Dune'', with the latter released on 14 June 2013.
