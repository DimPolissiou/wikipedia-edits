It comprises the former area of Valga District. The present-day county was created on 1 January 1990. The capital and largest town of Valga County is [[Valga, Estonia|Valga]], followed by [[T\u00f5rva]] and [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4]]. It is situated in the southern part of the country and borders [[P\u00f5lva County|P\u00f5lva]] and [[V\u00f5ru County]] to the east, [[Latvia]] to the south and west, and [[Viljandi County|Viljandi]] and [[Tartu County]] to the north. 29,944 people live in Valga County (as of 1 January 2015).<ref name=population>{{cite web|title=POPULATION NUMBER, AREA AND DENSITY, 1 JANUARY by Administrative unit or type of settlement, Year and Indicator|url=http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=Po0291&ti=POPULATION+NUMBER%2C+AREA+AND+DENSITY+BY+ADMINISTRATIVE+UNIT+OR+TYPE+OF+SETTLEMENT%2C+1++JANUARY&path=../I_Databas/Population/01Population_indicators_and_composition/04Population_figure_and_composition/&lang=1|publisher=[[Statistics Estonia]]|accessdate=4 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n== General ==\nValga County is located in the southern part of Estonia. By the economic-geographical and regional-political distribution it belongs to the area of South-East Estonia (together with P\u00f5lva and V\u00f5ru County). By historical ties and landscape the county belongs to the region of South Estonia (together with P\u00f5lva, V\u00f5ru, Viljandi, Tartu and [[J\u00f5geva County|J\u00f5geva Counties]]). With a population of 30,176 people (as of 1 January 2014), the total area of the county is 2,043.53&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2,046.49&nbsp;km\u00b2 together with the area of [[V\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv]]), it reaches 65&nbsp;km in the north\u2013south direction and 59&nbsp;km in the east\u2013west direction. Valga County ranks the 12th in Estonia by population and the 14th by the area.\n\nThe distances from the county centre, Valga, are the following: [[Tallinn]] 267&nbsp;km, <span lang=\"ET\">[[Tartu]]</span> 86&nbsp;km, [[Viljandi]] 88&nbsp;km, [[V\u00f5ru]] 73&nbsp;km, [[P\u00f5lva]] 96&nbsp;km, [[P\u00e4rnu]] 141&nbsp;km, [[Narva]] 264&nbsp;km and [[Riga]] 157&nbsp;km.\n\nValga County borders with Viljandi County in the north-west, with Tartu County in the north and P\u00f5lva and V\u00f5ru County in the east. Valga County has a borderline with the Republic of Latvia in the south and west (102.4&nbsp;km).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Medieval Period ===\nIt can be read from the [[Livonian Chronicle of Henry]] that the history of the county goes back to the 13th century when the [[Germans]] conquered the settlement. By the Chronicle the [[\u00dcmera River]] was the borderline between Estonia and Latvia. Historians suggest that the [[S\u00e4de River]] was the borderline, flowing through the northern part of Tireli Bog and falling into [[Lake Burtnieks]]. Meadows and forests surrounding the big Tireli Bog and the upper stream of the River S\u00e4de were probably even wider and impassable at that time and therefore functioning perfectly as a border.\n[[File:Helme linnus 2.jpg|left|thumb|208x208px|Ruins of Helme Order Castle, built in the 14th century]]\nThe ancient (13thcentury) national border ran in a totally different place. Assumably the area of H\u00e4rgm\u00e4e belonged to Estonian settlements and the national border went from the springs of the River S\u00e4de, passed the forests until the northernmost oxbow of the [[Koiva River]] and onwards alongside the river. Most likely the area of [[Kaagj\u00e4rve]] and Valga Town belonged to ancient [[Latgalians]].\n\nAfter the crusades and the Ancient Freedom Fight in 13th century, Valga County became a natural centre of the historical [[Old Livonia]] where the most important roads from north, south and east went through, gaining strategical importance.\n\n=== Early Modern Period ===\nCity rights were given to Valga by a Polish King [[Stefan Batory]] in 1584.\n\nOn the 3rdof July, 1783, the [[Empress Catherine II]] established a new administration order in the [[Baltic provinces]]. A new kreis (county), Valga Kreis, was constituted mainly from the territories of Riga and V\u00f5nnu Kreises. Valga Town which formerly belonged to Riga Kreis, went over to Valga Kreis. Valga Kreis consisted of eleven parishes, nine of them located on the present Latvian territory, and just two \u2013 Luke (Luga\u017ei in Latvian, Luhde in German) and H\u00e4rgm\u00e4e (\u0112r\u0123eme in Latvian, Ermes in German) \u2013 had an edge on the present Estonian area, mostly near Valga, which became an attraction centre of the new kreis.\n\nIn 1789, there were 891 citizens in Valga. As Valga became the centre of the kreis, [[St John's Church, Valga|St John's Church]] was founded and also the building of kreis institutions was built in 1783-1786 (later it became a prison).\n\n[[File:Taagepera m\u00f5isa peahoone2.jpg|thumb|The main building of Taagepera Manor (built in 1907-1912)]]\n\n=== Recent history ===\nOn 12 February 1919, the Government of the Republic of Estonia issued a regulation of constitution of Valga County, consisting of the territories gained during the [[Estonian War of Independence]]. Several parts of V\u00f5ru, Tartu and Viljandi Counties were close to Valga from the other side. On 19 April the first county governor was elected \u2013 [[Johann Kurvits]], a farmer of [[Karula, Viljandi County|Karula]]. He held this position until July 1921, when [[August Sild]] followed his position.\n\nUntil 1920s the surroundings of H\u00e4rgm\u00e4e and Valga belonged to the mixed area of Estonia-Latvia as there was no exact national border. Half of the citizens were Latvians, the other half were Estonians. In 1920 the national border was fixed and that helped to differentiate between the nations. Valga Kreis was divided so that Estonia got the areas of Paju and Sooru Manors and the majority of Valga (where the citizens were mostly Estonians), the rest belonged to Latvia.\n\n==== Independence ====\nValga County, almost in its present shape, was formed on 6 September 1920 when the course of the War of Independence and the situation at that time required Valga's separation from the other counties.\n\nOn 11 February 1921 the Estonian Government fixed the area of Valga County. V\u00f5ru County gave [[Kaagj\u00e4rve]], [[Karula, Valga County|Karula]], [[Laanemetsa]] and [[Taheva]] parishes, Tartu County gave [[T\u00f5lliste]], [[Laatre]], [[Sangaste]], [[Keeni]] and [[Kuigatsi]] parishes, Viljandi County gave [[J\u00f5geveste]], [[Patk\u00fcla]], [[Koork\u00fcla]], [[Taagepera]], [[Leebiku]], [[Helme, Estonia|Helme]], [[L\u00f5ve]] and [[Hummuli]] parishes. Later on, several administrative territorial changes were carried through. In 1921 [[Patk\u00fcla]] parish was separated from [[Holdre]] parish and [[T\u00f5rva]] borough. [[Purak\u00fcla]], which formerly belonged to [[Paju, Valga County|Paju]] parish was united to the town of [[Valga, Estonia|Valga]] in 1922. In 1924 [[Paju, Valga County|Paju]] parish was united to [[Sooru]] parish and on 2 July 1926, it started to bear the name [[T\u00f5rva]]. Since the second half of 1920s until 1939 there were 19 parishes in Valga County.\n\nIn 1939 many smaller parishes were united by the administrative reform. Ten parishes were left: [[Helme, Estonia|Helme]], [[Hummuli]], [[Kaagj\u00e4rve]], [[Karula, Valga County|Karula]], [[Kuigatsi]], [[P\u00f5drala]], [[Sangaste]], [[Taheva]], [[T\u00f5lliste]] and [[Vaok\u00fcla]].\n\n==== World War II and occupation ====\n[[File:T\u00f5rva 1944.jpg|left|thumb|281x281px|Aftermath of World War II. City centre of T\u00f5rva on the year 1944.]]\nThe last pre-occupation County Governor V\u00e4rdi Vellner had to give up his power on 8 July 1940. Nevertheless, the administrative division of 1939 lasted until 1950 when 39 county districts were formed. They were divided into 636 [[selsoviet|village soviets]].\n\nThe present territory of Valga County was divided into three parts: [[Valga, Estonia|Valga]], [[T\u00f5rva]] and [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4]] districts. In 1952 the oblasts of [[Tallinn]], [[Tartu]] and [[P\u00e4rnu]] were formed on the territory of the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonian SSR]].\n\nIn 1959 the liquidation of smaller districts began. [[Antsla]], [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4]] and [[T\u00f5rva]] districts were liquidated. T\u00f5rva and the village soviets of [[Haabsaare]], [[Helme, Estonia|Helme]], [[Koork\u00fcla]], [[M\u00f5niste]], [[Riidaja]] and [[Taagepera]] were united to Valga district. [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4]] town and the village soviets of Otep\u00e4\u00e4 and [[P\u00fchaj\u00e4rve]] were united to [[Elva, Estonia|Elva]] district. In 1961 [[M\u00f5niste]] was united to [[V\u00f5ru]] district.\n\nNext year, in 1962, Otep\u00e4\u00e4 and village soviets of [[Aakre, Estonia|Aakre]], Otep\u00e4\u00e4 and [[Palupera]] were reunited to Valga district. One year later some areas of [[P\u00f5lva]] District were united to Valga district. In 1966 the area of [[Valtina]] was added and thus the final border of Valga district was fixed.\n\nIn December 1989 the Chairman of the former Executive Committee of Valga District, Uno Heinla, was elected as the inaugural county governor following Estonia's reestablished independence. On 22 February 1990, the RSN Executive Committee of Valga District was reorganized and it became Valga County Government.\n\n==== Regaining Independence ====\nAfter the reindependence, there were three towns ([[Valga, Estonia|Valga]], [[T\u00f5rva]] and [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4]]) and 11 parishes formed in Valga County: [[Helme Parish|Helme]], [[Hummuli Parish|Hummuli]], [[Karula Parish|Karula]], [[\u00d5ru Parish|\u00d5ru]], [[Palupera Parish|Palupera]], [[P\u00f5drala Parish|P\u00f5drala]], [[P\u00fchaj\u00e4rve Parish|P\u00fchaj\u00e4rve]], [[Puka Parish|Puka]], [[Sangaste Parish|Sangaste]], [[Taheva Parish|Taheva]] and [[T\u00f5lliste Parish|T\u00f5lliste]]. On 1 January 1999, the town of [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4]] and P\u00fchaj\u00e4rve Parish were merged and a new [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4 Parish]] was formed. Despite that, the town of Otep\u00e4\u00e4 kept holding the town rights, but is officially part of the rural municipality (parish).\n\n== County Government ==\nThe [[County Governments of Estonia|County Government]] (Estonian: ''Maavalitsus'') is led by [[County Governors of Estonia|Governor]] (Estonian: ''maavanem''), who is appointed by the [[Government of Estonia]] for a term of five years. Currently the Governor position is held by [[Margus Lepik]].\n\n== Municipalities, settlement and population ==\nThere are 3 local municipalities in Valga County including Valga (county capital), T\u00f5rva, Helme, Hummuli, Karula, Otep\u00e4\u00e4, Palupera, Puka, P\u00f5drala, Sangaste, Taheva, T\u00f5lliste and \u00d5ru Parishes.\n\n=== Settlement units ===\nThere are 3 towns, 7 boroughs and 150 villages in Valga County.\n\n[[File:Valga municipalities.png|thumb|left|350px|Municipalities of Valga County]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! # !!

The population density was 14.8 ppl/km\u00b2. Since 2004 the population of the county has decreased by 4154 people. The main reason besides the natural negative [[population growth]] is the mechanical growth \u2013 the people who have left the county.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Relief ===\nThe [[landscape]] of Valga County is various. The western part is located in the south-eastern part of [[Sakala Upland]] where the [[moraine]] plain is being varied by old valleys, some hills and ridges. In the northern part the landscape is characterized by small [[drumlin]]s, the low and wet areas are covered with [[meadow]]s and forests. The surrounding area of T\u00f5rva-Helme is flatter but separated by the [[\u00d5hne|River \u00d5hne]] and the valleys of its tributaries ([[Valley of Tikste]]). In many places the sandstone of the substrate can be seen on the hillsides. The territory is quite densely populated. The farmlands are varied by meadows, lakes and a few patches of forest. In the southern part, around Hummuli and Taagepera, some rolling hills can be found.\n[[File:Rubina soo 2.jpg|thumb|249x249px|[[Bog pool]] in Rubina bog]]\nIn the southern part of the county, there is a large sandy area with big forests, [[moorland]]s and [[bog]]s. In the middle part of the county the valley of the [[V\u00e4ike Emaj\u00f5gi|River V\u00e4ike-Emaj\u00f5gi]] runs from north to south. It is continued by Valga Basin with mainly [[flexuous]] moraine landscape, cut through by low valleys or basin valleys. The most noticeable is the valley of the River V\u00e4ike-Emaj\u00f5gi where [[Pedeli]] Valley flows into. In the middle part of Valga Basin there is a large boggy meadow of Korva. Larger farmlands are mainly situated around Sangaste and Laatre.\n[[File:Kuutsem\u00e4gi, 2009.jpg|left|thumb|236x236px|The highest peak of Valga county - Kuutsem\u00e4e (217 m)]]\nThe most various and highest part of the county is located around Otep\u00e4\u00e4. The highest peaks are [[Kuutsem\u00e4gi|Kuutsem\u00e4gi Hill]] (217 m), [[Meegaste|Meegaste Hill]] (214 m) and [[Harim\u00e4gi|Harim\u00e4gi Hill]] (212 m). The moraine landscape is varied by low rolling hills and many lakes, the biggest and the best-known lake is [[P\u00fchaj\u00e4rv]]. On the edge areas of the upland the difference between the edges is small but the relief is strongly differentiated. To the south-east of Valga Basin, Karula Hills can be seen heading from the west to the east. The eastern part of the hills has especially varied relief. Heading to the west, the relief becomes lower and changes into lower hills continuing in the [[Latvia|Republic of Latvia]]. There are many lakes in Karula. The best-known lake is [[Karula Pikkj\u00e4rv]] and it is located on the northern edge of Karula Hills.\n\nHargla Basin is located in the southern part of the county. It is a mildly flat area between the uplands with some lonely moraine hills. The Valleys of [[Gauja|Koiva River]] and Mustj\u00f5e River together with the [[Aheru|Lake Aheru]] form a very picturesque area.\n\nThe area of forest land of the county is almost 114,000 hectares, which forms 56.7% of the area of Valga County. [[Pine]] and [[spruce]] are the main species. Forests are differentiated by meadows, moorlands, everglades and bogs. 7,900 hectares of the total area are covered with bogs, of which 5,400 hectares are moorlands. The largest bogs are Rubina, [[Korva bog|Korva]] and [[Lagesoo]].\n\n=== Lakes and rivers ===\nValga County has many lakes. Most of them are located in [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4 Upland]], on the area of Karula Hills and on the catchment area of \u00d5hne River. There are more than 180 natural lakes with the area of more than one hectare and with the total area of 17&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. \nThe biggest lake is \nP\u00fchj\u00e4rv (286 ha),\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" \n! colspan=\"2\" |Largest lakes of Valga county (ha)\n|-\n|[[V\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv]]\n|300*\n|-\n|[[P\u00fchaj\u00e4rv]]\n|285.9\n|-\n|[[Lake Aheru|Aheru]]\n|234\n|-\n|N\u00f5uni\n|78.8\n|-\n|T\u00fcndre\n|72.9\n|-\n|Valgj\u00e4rv (Koork\u00fcla)\n|44.1\n|-\n|Suur-Apja\n|42.6\n|-\n|Korij\u00e4rv\n|36.4\n|-\n|Pikkj\u00e4rv (Karula)\n|34.9\n|-\n|N\u00fcpli\n|27.5\n|-\n|Inni\n|24.5\n|-\n|Kaarna\n|23.6\n|-\n|M\u00f5rtsuka\n|19.7\n|-\n|Juusa\n|19.3\n|-\n|K\u00e4\u00e4riku\n|19.3\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |*part of the lake within county borders\n|}\n\nfollowed by Lake Aheru (234 ha). The southern part of [[V\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv|Lake V\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv]], with the area of 300 hectares, is also included within the borders of Valga County. Most of the lakes are quite shallow and not deeper than 10 m. The deepest lakes in the county are [[Udsu]] (30.2 m) and [[Petaj\u00e4rv]] (25 m), both located on the territory of [[Koork\u00fcla]] Lakes where the old valleys have been filled by the sediments from the [[Ice age]].

It comprises the former area of Valga District. The present-day county was created on 1 January 1990. The capital and largest town of Valga County is [[Valga, Estonia|Valga]], followed by [[T\u00f5rva]] and [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4]]. It is situated in the southern part of the country and borders [[P\u00f5lva County|P\u00f5lva]] and [[V\u00f5ru County]] to the east, [[Latvia]] to the south and west, and [[Viljandi County|Viljandi]] and [[Tartu County]] to the north. 29,944 people live in Valga County (as of 1 January 2015).<ref name=population>{{cite web|title=POPULATION NUMBER, AREA AND DENSITY, 1 JANUARY by Administrative unit or type of settlement, Year and Indicator|url=http://pub.stat.ee/px-web.2001/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=Po0291&ti=POPULATION+NUMBER%2C+AREA+AND+DENSITY+BY+ADMINISTRATIVE+UNIT+OR+TYPE+OF+SETTLEMENT%2C+1++JANUARY&path=../I_Databas/Population/01Population_indicators_and_composition/04Population_figure_and_composition/&lang=1|publisher=[[Statistics Estonia]]|accessdate=4 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n== General ==\nValga County is located in the southern part of Estonia. By the economic-geographical and regional-political distribution it belongs to the area of South-East Estonia (together with P\u00f5lva and V\u00f5ru County). By historical ties and landscape the county belongs to the region of South Estonia (together with P\u00f5lva, V\u00f5ru, Viljandi, Tartu and [[J\u00f5geva County|J\u00f5geva Counties]]). With a population of 30,176 people (as of 1 January 2014), the total area of the county is 2,043.53&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2,046.49&nbsp;km\u00b2 together with the area of [[V\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv]]), it reaches 65&nbsp;km in the north\u2013south direction and 59&nbsp;km in the east\u2013west direction. Valga County ranks the 12th in Estonia by population and the 14th by the area.\n\nThe distances from the county centre, Valga, are the following: [[Tallinn]] 267&nbsp;km, <span lang=\"ET\">[[Tartu]]</span> 86&nbsp;km, [[Viljandi]] 88&nbsp;km, [[V\u00f5ru]] 73&nbsp;km, [[P\u00f5lva]] 96&nbsp;km, [[P\u00e4rnu]] 141&nbsp;km, [[Narva]] 264&nbsp;km and [[Riga]] 157&nbsp;km.\n\nValga County borders with Viljandi County in the north-west, with Tartu County in the north and P\u00f5lva and V\u00f5ru County in the east. Valga County has a borderline with the Republic of Latvia in the south and west (102.4&nbsp;km).\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Medieval Period ===\nIt can be read from the [[Livonian Chronicle of Henry]] that the history of the county goes back to the 13th century when the [[Germans]] conquered the settlement. By the Chronicle the [[\u00dcmera River]] was the borderline between Estonia and Latvia. Historians suggest that the [[S\u00e4de River]] was the borderline, flowing through the northern part of Tireli Bog and falling into [[Lake Burtnieks]]. Meadows and forests surrounding the big Tireli Bog and the upper stream of the River S\u00e4de were probably even wider and impassable at that time and therefore functioning perfectly as a border.\n[[File:Helme linnus 2.jpg|left|thumb|208x208px|Ruins of Helme Order Castle, built in the 14th century]]\nThe ancient (13thcentury) national border ran in a totally different place. Assumably the area of H\u00e4rgm\u00e4e belonged to Estonian settlements and the national border went from the springs of the River S\u00e4de, passed the forests until the northernmost oxbow of the [[Koiva River]] and onwards alongside the river. Most likely the area of [[Kaagj\u00e4rve]] and Valga Town belonged to ancient [[Latgalians]].\n\nAfter the crusades and the Ancient Freedom Fight in 13th century, Valga County became a natural centre of the historical [[Old Livonia]] where the most important roads from north, south and east went through, gaining strategical importance.\n\n=== Early Modern Period ===\nCity rights were given to Valga by a Polish King [[Stefan Batory]] in 1584.\n\nOn the 3rdof July, 1783, the [[Empress Catherine II]] established a new administration order in the [[Baltic provinces]]. A new kreis (county), Valga Kreis, was constituted mainly from the territories of Riga and V\u00f5nnu Kreises. Valga Town which formerly belonged to Riga Kreis, went over to Valga Kreis. Valga Kreis consisted of eleven parishes, nine of them located on the present Latvian territory, and just two \u2013 Luke (Luga\u017ei in Latvian, Luhde in German) and H\u00e4rgm\u00e4e (\u0112r\u0123eme in Latvian, Ermes in German) \u2013 had an edge on the present Estonian area, mostly near Valga, which became an attraction centre of the new kreis.\n\nIn 1789, there were 891 citizens in Valga. As Valga became the centre of the kreis, [[St John's Church, Valga|St John's Church]] was founded and also the building of kreis institutions was built in 1783-1786 (later it became a prison).\n\n[[File:Taagepera m\u00f5isa peahoone2.jpg|thumb|The main building of Taagepera Manor (built in 1907-1912)]]\n\n=== Recent history ===\nOn 12 February 1919, the Government of the Republic of Estonia issued a regulation of constitution of Valga County, consisting of the territories gained during the [[Estonian War of Independence]]. Several parts of V\u00f5ru, Tartu and Viljandi Counties were close to Valga from the other side. On 19 April the first county governor was elected \u2013 [[Johann Kurvits]], a farmer of [[Karula, Viljandi County|Karula]]. He held this position until July 1921, when [[August Sild]] followed his position.\n\nUntil 1920s the surroundings of H\u00e4rgm\u00e4e and Valga belonged to the mixed area of Estonia-Latvia as there was no exact national border. Half of the citizens were Latvians, the other half were Estonians. In 1920 the national border was fixed and that helped to differentiate between the nations. Valga Kreis was divided so that Estonia got the areas of Paju and Sooru Manors and the majority of Valga (where the citizens were mostly Estonians), the rest belonged to Latvia.\n\n==== Independence ====\nValga County, almost in its present shape, was formed on 6 September 1920 when the course of the War of Independence and the situation at that time required Valga's separation from the other counties.\n\nOn 11 February 1921 the Estonian Government fixed the area of Valga County. V\u00f5ru County gave [[Kaagj\u00e4rve]], [[Karula, Valga County|Karula]], [[Laanemetsa]] and [[Taheva]] parishes, Tartu County gave [[T\u00f5lliste]], [[Laatre]], [[Sangaste]], [[Keeni]] and [[Kuigatsi]] parishes, Viljandi County gave [[J\u00f5geveste]], [[Patk\u00fcla]], [[Koork\u00fcla]], [[Taagepera]], [[Leebiku]], [[Helme, Estonia|Helme]], [[L\u00f5ve]] and [[Hummuli]] parishes. Later on, several administrative territorial changes were carried through. In 1921 [[Patk\u00fcla]] parish was separated from [[Holdre]] parish and [[T\u00f5rva]] borough. [[Purak\u00fcla]], which formerly belonged to [[Paju, Valga County|Paju]] parish was united to the town of [[Valga, Estonia|Valga]] in 1922. In 1924 [[Paju, Valga County|Paju]] parish was united to [[Sooru]] parish and on 2 July 1926, it started to bear the name [[T\u00f5rva]]. Since the second half of 1920s until 1939 there were 19 parishes in Valga County.\n\nIn 1939 many smaller parishes were united by the administrative reform. Ten parishes were left: [[Helme, Estonia|Helme]], [[Hummuli]], [[Kaagj\u00e4rve]], [[Karula, Valga County|Karula]], [[Kuigatsi]], [[P\u00f5drala]], [[Sangaste]], [[Taheva]], [[T\u00f5lliste]] and [[Vaok\u00fcla]].\n\n==== World War II and occupation ====\n[[File:T\u00f5rva 1944.jpg|left|thumb|281x281px|Aftermath of World War II. City centre of T\u00f5rva on the year 1944.]]\nThe last pre-occupation County Governor V\u00e4rdi Vellner had to give up his power on 8 July 1940. Nevertheless, the administrative division of 1939 lasted until 1950 when 39 county districts were formed. They were divided into 636 [[selsoviet|village soviets]].\n\nThe present territory of Valga County was divided into three parts: [[Valga, Estonia|Valga]], [[T\u00f5rva]] and [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4]] districts. In 1952 the oblasts of [[Tallinn]], [[Tartu]] and [[P\u00e4rnu]] were formed on the territory of the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonian SSR]].\n\nIn 1959 the liquidation of smaller districts began. [[Antsla]], [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4]] and [[T\u00f5rva]] districts were liquidated. T\u00f5rva and the village soviets of [[Haabsaare]], [[Helme, Estonia|Helme]], [[Koork\u00fcla]], [[M\u00f5niste]], [[Riidaja]] and [[Taagepera]] were united to Valga district. [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4]] town and the village soviets of Otep\u00e4\u00e4 and [[P\u00fchaj\u00e4rve]] were united to [[Elva, Estonia|Elva]] district. In 1961 [[M\u00f5niste]] was united to [[V\u00f5ru]] district.\n\nNext year, in 1962, Otep\u00e4\u00e4 and village soviets of [[Aakre, Estonia|Aakre]], Otep\u00e4\u00e4 and [[Palupera]] were reunited to Valga district. One year later some areas of [[P\u00f5lva]] District were united to Valga district. In 1966 the area of [[Valtina]] was added and thus the final border of Valga district was fixed.\n\nIn December 1989 the Chairman of the former Executive Committee of Valga District, Uno Heinla, was elected as the inaugural county governor following Estonia's reestablished independence. On 22 February 1990, the RSN Executive Committee of Valga District was reorganized and it became Valga County Government.\n\n==== Regaining Independence ====\nAfter the reindependence, there were three towns ([[Valga, Estonia|Valga]], [[T\u00f5rva]] and [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4]]) and 11 parishes formed in Valga County: [[Helme Parish|Helme]], [[Hummuli Parish|Hummuli]], [[Karula Parish|Karula]], [[\u00d5ru Parish|\u00d5ru]], [[Palupera Parish|Palupera]], [[P\u00f5drala Parish|P\u00f5drala]], [[P\u00fchaj\u00e4rve Parish|P\u00fchaj\u00e4rve]], [[Puka Parish|Puka]], [[Sangaste Parish|Sangaste]], [[Taheva Parish|Taheva]] and [[T\u00f5lliste Parish|T\u00f5lliste]]. On 1 January 1999, the town of [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4]] and P\u00fchaj\u00e4rve Parish were merged and a new [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4 Parish]] was formed. Despite that, the town of Otep\u00e4\u00e4 kept holding the town rights, but is officially part of the rural municipality (parish).\n\n== County Government ==\nThe [[County Governments of Estonia|County Government]] (Estonian: ''Maavalitsus'') is led by [[County Governors of Estonia|Governor]] (Estonian: ''maavanem''), who is appointed by the [[Government of Estonia]] for a term of five years. Currently the Governor position is held by [[Margus Lepik]].\n\n== Municipalities, settlement and population ==\nThere are 3 local municipalities in Valga County including Valga (county capital), T\u00f5rva, Helme, Hummuli, Karula, Otep\u00e4\u00e4, Palupera, Puka, P\u00f5drala, Sangaste, Taheva, T\u00f5lliste and \u00d5ru Parishes.\n\n=== Settlement units ===\nThere are 3 towns, 7 boroughs and 150 villages in Valga County.\n\n[[File:Valga municipalities.png|thumb|left|350px|Municipalities of Valga County]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! # !!

The population density was 14.8 ppl/km\u00b2. Since 2004 the population of the county has decreased by 4154 people. The main reason besides the natural negative [[population growth]] is the mechanical growth \u2013 the people who have left the county.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Relief ===\nThe [[landscape]] of Valga County is various. The western part is located in the south-eastern part of [[Sakala Upland]] where the [[moraine]] plain is being varied by old valleys, some hills and ridges. In the northern part the landscape is characterized by small [[drumlin]]s, the low and wet areas are covered with [[meadow]]s and forests. The surrounding area of T\u00f5rva-Helme is flatter but separated by the [[\u00d5hne|River \u00d5hne]] and the valleys of its tributaries ([[Valley of Tikste]]). In many places the sandstone of the substrate can be seen on the hillsides. The territory is quite densely populated. The farmlands are varied by meadows, lakes and a few patches of forest. In the southern part, around Hummuli and Taagepera, some rolling hills can be found.\n[[File:Rubina soo 2.jpg|thumb|249x249px|[[Bog pool]] in Rubina bog]]\nIn the southern part of the county, there is a large sandy area with big forests, [[moorland]]s and [[bog]]s. In the middle part of the county the valley of the [[V\u00e4ike Emaj\u00f5gi|River V\u00e4ike-Emaj\u00f5gi]] runs from north to south. It is continued by Valga Basin with mainly [[flexuous]] moraine landscape, cut through by low valleys or basin valleys. The most noticeable is the valley of the River V\u00e4ike-Emaj\u00f5gi where [[Pedeli]] Valley flows into. In the middle part of Valga Basin there is a large boggy meadow of Korva. Larger farmlands are mainly situated around Sangaste and Laatre.\n[[File:Kuutsem\u00e4gi, 2009.jpg|left|thumb|236x236px|The highest peak of Valga county - Kuutsem\u00e4e (217 m)]]\nThe most various and highest part of the county is located around Otep\u00e4\u00e4. The highest peaks are [[Kuutsem\u00e4gi|Kuutsem\u00e4gi Hill]] (217 m), [[Meegaste|Meegaste Hill]] (214 m) and [[Harim\u00e4gi|Harim\u00e4gi Hill]] (212 m). The moraine landscape is varied by low rolling hills and many lakes, the biggest and the best-known lake is [[P\u00fchaj\u00e4rv]]. On the edge areas of the upland the difference between the edges is small but the relief is strongly differentiated. To the south-east of Valga Basin, Karula Hills can be seen heading from the west to the east. The eastern part of the hills has especially varied relief. Heading to the west, the relief becomes lower and changes into lower hills continuing in the [[Latvia|Republic of Latvia]]. There are many lakes in Karula. The best-known lake is [[Karula Pikkj\u00e4rv]] and it is located on the northern edge of Karula Hills.\n\nHargla Basin is located in the southern part of the county. It is a mildly flat area between the uplands with some lonely moraine hills. The Valleys of [[Gauja|Koiva River]] and Mustj\u00f5e River together with the [[Aheru|Lake Aheru]] form a very picturesque area.\n\nThe area of forest land of the county is almost 114,000 hectares, which forms 56.7% of the area of Valga County. [[Pine]] and [[spruce]] are the main species. Forests are differentiated by meadows, moorlands, everglades and bogs. 7,900 hectares of the total area are covered with bogs, of which 5,400 hectares are moorlands. The largest bogs are Rubina, [[Korva bog|Korva]] and [[Lagesoo]].\n\n=== Lakes and rivers ===\nValga County has many lakes. Most of them are located in [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4 Upland]], on the area of Karula Hills and on the catchment area of \u00d5hne River. There are more than 180 natural lakes with the area of more than one hectare and with the total area of 17&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. \nThe biggest lake is \nP\u00fchj\u00e4rv (286 ha),\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" \n! colspan=\"2\" |Largest lakes of Valga county (ha)\n|-\n|[[V\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv]]\n|300*\n|-\n|[[P\u00fchaj\u00e4rv]]\n|285.9\n|-\n|[[Lake Aheru|Aheru]]\n|234\n|-\n|N\u00f5uni\n|78.8\n|-\n|T\u00fcndre\n|72.9\n|-\n|Valgj\u00e4rv (Koork\u00fcla)\n|44.1\n|-\n|Suur-Apja\n|42.6\n|-\n|Korij\u00e4rv\n|36.4\n|-\n|Pikkj\u00e4rv (Karula)\n|34.9\n|-\n|N\u00fcpli\n|27.5\n|-\n|Inni\n|24.5\n|-\n|Kaarna\n|23.6\n|-\n|M\u00f5rtsuka\n|19.7\n|-\n|Juusa\n|19.3\n|-\n|K\u00e4\u00e4riku\n|19.3\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |*part of the lake within county borders\n|}\n\nfollowed by Lake Aheru (234 ha). The southern part of [[V\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv|Lake V\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv]], with the area of 300 hectares, is also included within the borders of Valga County. Most of the lakes are quite shallow and not deeper than 10 m. The deepest lakes in the county are [[Udsu]] (30.2 m) and [[Petaj\u00e4rv]] (25 m), both located on the territory of [[Koork\u00fcla]] Lakes where the old valleys have been filled by the sediments from the [[Ice age]]. There are four official swimming places \u2013 the beach of [[Riiska|Lake Riiska]] and [[Lake Vanam\u00f5isa]] in T\u00f5rva, the beach of Lake P\u00fchaj\u00e4rv in Otep\u00e4\u00e4 and the beach on the sides of Pedeli River in Valga.\n\nThe fish fauna of the lakes is quite changeable as many fish die during cold winters because of shallow water. Species such as [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|whitefish]], [[bream]], [[Esox|pike]], and [[perch]] die because of a lack of oxygen. There may be more than ten species of fish in some lakes.\n\nThere are more than 30 artificial lakes with the area of one hectare and with the total area of 100 ha, 20 of which being used publicly. The biggest artificial lake is [[Puide Reservoir]] on [[J\u00f5ku|J\u00f5ku River]] (11.5 ha).\n\nThe best-known river of the area is V\u00e4ike-Emaj\u00f5gi, starting from Lake P\u00fchaj\u00e4rv and falling into Lake V\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv, flowing fully on the territory of Valga County. Another important river is Pedeli, which flows through Valga and is the biggest tributary of the River Emaj\u00f5gi. The River \u00d5hne is flowing through T\u00f5rva and the J\u00f5ku River is the tributary of the \u00d5hne River. The River Mustj\u00f5gi flows through the south-eastern corner of the county towards [[V\u00f5ru County]].\n[[File:P\u00fchaj\u00e4rve s\u00f5jatamm udus.jpg|left|thumb|221x221px|[[War Oak of P\u00fchaj\u00e4rve]] has the largest trunk circumference in Valga county (6.98 m) ]]\n\n=== Nature protection ===\nThe territory under nature protection composes around 20% of the whole territory of Valga County. The most important nature objects under protection are [[Otep\u00e4\u00e4 Nature Park]], [[Karula National Park]] and [[Koiva-Mustj\u00f5e Landscape Conservation Area]].

The biggest one in Valga County and also in Estonia is Otep\u00e4\u00e4 Nature Park with the area of 22,430 ha. The territory under protection, also including nature reserves and permanent habitats form the area of 43,431 ha.\n\nThere are 28 indigenous trees and 5 glacial boulders under protection as a single object.

Light-coloured sandstones from the Middle Devonian Burtniek stage, clay and marl layers are spread on the majority of the territory of the county. On the narrow stripe of the county's northern part, the sandstones of the Middle Devonian Aruk\u00fcla Stage become visible. They are cross-bedded with the interlayers of [[siltstone]]s, [[clay]]s and [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]]s.\n\nThe substrate is covered by the complex of quaternary sediments (glacial, limno-glacial and fluvio-glacial). Moraine is dominant on the area of the northern and middle parts of the county. Gravels, sands, [[loam]]s and bog sediments are diverged. The geological construction of the substrate is complicated (thickness is varying 10\u2013100 m and more). The [[surface water]] lies at the depth of 0\u201310 m, on the hills even deeper. From the aspect of engineering geology, the ground of the county is mostly of good load-capacity, but the relief can be an obstacle for construction works.\n\n== Economy ==\nValga County is an area of [[industry]] and [[agriculture]] but also an area of a well-known recreation and sports centre Otep\u00e4\u00e4.

professional [[Snooker world rankings|ranking]] [[snooker]] tournament that took place between 16 April and 2 May 2011 at the [[Crucible Theatre]] in [[Sheffield]], [[England]]. It was the 35th consecutive year that the World Snooker Championship had been held at the Crucible and was the last ranking event of the [[Snooker season 2010/2011|2010/2011 season]]. The event was organised by the WPBSA and had a prize fund of \u00a31,111,000.  The tournament was sponsored by [[Betfred|Betfred.com]].\n\n[[Neil Robertson]] was the defending champion, but lost 8\u201310 against [[Judd Trump]] in the first round. Trump became the youngest player since 1990 to reach the final where he lost to [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]]. This was Higgins' fourth world title, becoming only the fourth man to win four or more championships. [[Ding Junhui]] meanwhile became the first player from China to reach the semi-finals. Mark King and Ding Junhui made the highest breaks at the Crucible with 138; while James Wattana compiled the highest break of the tournament during qualifying with 141.\n\nAn audience of 3.93 million viewers watched the final session in [[Great Britain]] with 2.03 million watching the third session of the final.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weekly Top 30 Programmes|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-30?|publisher=Barb.co.uk|accessdate=11 May 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6SG3Fv74H?url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-30|archive-date=1 September 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}} (No permanent link available.

Although he was born to an obscure Byzantine aristocratic family, his mother was related to the imperial [[Komnenos]] clan. He married a younger daughter of the Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios&nbsp;III Angelos]] in 1200. He received the title of ''[[Despot (court title)|despot]]'' before 1203, demonstrating his right to succeed his father-in-law on the throne. \n\nThe [[Fourth Crusade]] forced Alexios{{nbsp}}III to flee from Constantinople in 1203. Theodore was imprisoned by the crusaders (or Latins), but he escaped. After crossing the [[Bosporus]] into [[Asia Minor]] (in present-day Turkey), he started to organise the local Greeks' resistance against the Latins in [[Bithynia]] in his father-in-law's name. He concluded an alliance with the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] [[Sultanate of Rum|Sultan of Rum]], but he could not stop the Latins' expansion. Neither could he prevent a claimant to the imperial throne, [[Alexios I of Trebizond|Alexios Komnenos]], from establishing a Byzantine successor state, the [[Empire of Trebizond]], in northern Asia Minor. Theodore's position consolidated only after Tzar [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Latins in the [[Battle of Adrianople (1205)|Battle of Adrianople]] (in [[Thrace]]) in 1205.\n\nGreeks fleeing from the [[Latin Empire]]\u2014the [[crusader state]] that emerged in the Byzantine core territories\u2014swarmed to Asia Minor to live under Theodore's rule. The Latins captured Theodore's father-in-law and made an alliance with Alexios{{nbsp}}I of Trebizond, but Theodore routed their united troops. He secured the support of most [[Bithynia|Bithynian]] aristocrats and seized the domains of those who resisted him. He assumed the traditional titles of the Byzantine emperors in 1205. Three years later, he convoked a Church council to elect a new [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople]]. The patriarch crowned Theodore emperor and established his seat at Theodore's capital, [[Nicaea]]. The Orthodox population of the Latin Empire regarded Theodore as the main defender of their Church, but the [[Despotate of Epirus#Rulers|rulers of Epirus]]\u2014a realm that developed in the western regions of the Byzantine Empire\u2014debated the legality of his coronation.\n\nTheodore's father-in-law did not abandon his claim to the throne. After being released from prison, Alexios{{nbsp}}III persuaded the Seljuqs to invade Nicaea, but Theodore defeated them in 1211. The Latin Emperor [[Henry of Flanders]] captured important fortresses in western Asia Minor in 1212, but he ran out of soldiers and could not place garrisons in them. Henry implicitly acknowledged the existence of the Empire of Nicea in his peace treaty with Theodore. Theodore conquered western [[Paphlagonia]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast from Alexios{{nbsp}}I Komnenos. Around 1220, Theodore tried to persuade the Latins of Constantinople to acknowledge his rule, but they refused. Theodore established a powerful state, located in the vicinity of Constantinople, which enabled his successors to expel the Latins from the city and revive the Byzantine Empire in 1261.\n\n== Early life ==\n\n=== Parentage ===\n\nTheodore Komnenos Laskaris was born to a noble but not particularly renowned Byzantine family around 1175.<ref group=\"note\">Akropolites stated that Theodore was \"more than 45&nbsp;years old but less than 50\" when he died in 1221, implying that he was born between 1171 and 1176. [[Nicephorus Gregoras]] said that Theodore was \"around 30&nbsp;years old\" when he was proclaimed emperor in 1205.</ref>{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=16, 236}} His parents' names are unknown. If Theodore followed the Byzantine custom of [[Papponymic|giving his father's name to his firstborn son]], his father was called Nicholas.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=16}} Theodore's mother belonged to an unidentified branch of the imperial [[Komnenos]] family and he proudly adopted her surname.{{sfn|Volkoff|2015|p=198}}{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=16\u201317}} Theodore had no less than six brothers\u2014[[Constantine Laskaris|Constantine]], George, [[Alexios Laskaris|Alexios]], [[Isaac Laskaris|Isaac]], Manuel and Michael. Manuel and Michael must have been born to a different mother, as they bore the surname Tzamantouros instead of Komnenos.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=16}} Theodore was also related to the aristocratic [[Phokas (Byzantine family)|Phokas]] family, most likely through the marriage of one of his aunts.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=17}}\n\nThe [[Laskaris]] held estates in western [[Asia Minor]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=17}} Both Theodore and his brother, Constantine, had a seal representing Saint George and bearing the inscription Diasorites.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=17}}{{sfn|Angold|2011|pp=69\u201370}} The seal expressed their connection to the monastery of Saint George Diasorites, located in [[Dios Hieron (Lydia)|Pyrgion]] in the valley of the river [[K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Menderes River|Kaistros]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=17}}{{sfn|Volkoff|2015|p=197}}\n\n=== Early career ===\n\nThe contemporaneous historian [[Niketas Choniates]] introduced Theodore as a \"daring youth and fierce warrior\" in his chronicle.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=19}} The Byzantine historian [[George Akropolites]] recorded that Theodore was \"small in body but not excessively so, quite dark, and had a flowing beard forked at the end\".{{sfn|Head|1980|p=238}} Theodore rose to prominence through his family ties with the Komneni. His first extant seal mentions his titles of ''[[sebastos]]'' and ''[[protovestiarites]]''. The first one was a court title, originally reserved for the Byzantine emperors' relatives, but Emperor [[Alexios III&nbsp;Angelos]] ({{reign|1195|1203}}) started to sell it to wealthy merchants.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=18}} As ''protovestiarites'', Theodore was the commander of a cadet unit of the guards of the [[Palace of Blachernae|imperial palace]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=18\u201319}}\n\nEmperor Alexios{{nbsp}}III who had no sons wanted to solve the problem of succession by marrying off his two eldest daughters.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=19}} Late in 1200, he gave his firstborn daughter, Irene, in marriage to [[Alexios Palaiologos (despot)|Alexios Palaiologos]], and her younger sister, [[Anna Komnene Angelina|Anna]], to Theodore.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=19}} Palaiologos was elevated to the rank of ''[[Despot (court title)|despot]]'', demonstrating his right to succeed his father-in-law on the throne.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=19}} When Palaiologos died before 1203, Theodore received the title of ''despot''.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=19}}\n\n=== Fall of Constantinople ===\n\n[[File:ConquestOfConstantinopleByTheCrusadersIn1204.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Soldiers holding crossbows and stones stand on a town's walls defending it against soldiers attacking from ships.|Crusaders besieging Constantinople in 1204.]]\n\nTo seize the Byzantine throne, Emperor Alexios{{nbsp}}III blinded and imprisoned his elder brother, [[Isaac II Angelos]] ({{reign|1185|1195}}).{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=20}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=659}} Isaac's son, [[Alexios IV Angelos|Alexios]], fled from Constantinople to Germany to seek his Catholic relatives' assistance. He concluded an agreement with the leaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]], promising a large sum, 800,000 ''[[Hyperpyron|hyperpyra]]'', for their support.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=662}} The crusaders reached Constantinople and captured [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]] on the opposite coast of the [[Golden Horn]] on 6{{nbsp}}July 1203.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=20}} Theodore conducted raids against the invaders, but they [[Siege of Constantinople (1203)|laid siege to the Byzantine capital]].{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=20\u201321}} The [[walls of Constantinople]] were vulnerable, and Alexios{{nbsp}}III fled in panic to [[Thrace]] during the night of 17\u201318&nbsp;July.

His wife and daughters accompanied him.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=23}} They reached [[Nicaea]], but the burghers of the town only admitted his family, because they feared Alexios{{nbsp}}IV's revenge.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|pp=23\u201324}} Theodore, as he later remembered, moved \"from one region to another\", avoiding the traps that his (unidentified) enemies laid for him.{{sfn|Angelov|2019|p=25}}\n\nAlexios{{nbsp}}IV could not pay off the crusaders. They refused to leave Constantinople and raided and plundered the nearby [[Thracia]]n villages. The Byzantines blamed Alexios{{nbsp}}IV for the crusaders' acts.

Although he was born to an obscure Byzantine aristocratic family, his mother was related to the imperial [[Komnenos]] clan. He married a younger daughter of the Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios&nbsp;III Angelos]] in 1200. He received the title of ''[[Despot (court title)|despot]]'' before 1203, demonstrating his right to succeed his father-in-law on the throne. \n\nThe [[Fourth Crusade]] forced Alexios{{nbsp}}III to flee from Constantinople in 1203. Theodore was imprisoned by the crusaders (or Latins), but he escaped. After crossing the [[Bosporus]] into [[Asia Minor]] (in present-day Turkey), he started to organise the local Greeks' resistance against the Latins in [[Bithynia]] in his father-in-law's name. He concluded an alliance with the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] [[Sultanate of Rum|Sultan of Rum]], but he could not stop the Latins' expansion. Neither could he prevent a claimant to the imperial throne, [[Alexios I of Trebizond|Alexios Komnenos]], from establishing a Byzantine successor state, the [[Empire of Trebizond]], in northern Asia Minor. Theodore's position consolidated only after Tzar [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Latins in the [[Battle of Adrianople (1205)|Battle of Adrianople]] (in [[Thrace]]) in 1205.\n\nGreeks fleeing from the [[Latin Empire]]\u2014the [[crusader state]] that emerged in the Byzantine core territories\u2014swarmed to Asia Minor to live under Theodore's rule. The Latins captured Theodore's father-in-law and made an alliance with Alexios{{nbsp}}I of Trebizond, but Theodore routed their united troops. He secured the support of most [[Bithynia|Bithynian]] aristocrats and seized the domains of those who resisted him. He assumed the traditional titles of the Byzantine emperors in 1205. Three years later, he convoked a Church council to elect a new [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople]]. The patriarch crowned Theodore emperor and established his seat at Theodore's capital, [[Nicaea]]. The Orthodox population of the Latin Empire regarded Theodore as the main defender of their Church, but the [[Despotate of Epirus#Rulers|rulers of Epirus]]\u2014a realm that developed in the western regions of the Byzantine Empire\u2014debated the legality of his coronation.\n\nTheodore's father-in-law did not abandon his claim to the throne. After being released from prison, Alexios{{nbsp}}III persuaded the Seljuqs to invade Nicaea, but Theodore defeated them in 1211. The Latin Emperor [[Henry of Flanders]] captured important fortresses in western Asia Minor in 1212, but he ran out of soldiers and could not place garrisons in them. Henry implicitly acknowledged the existence of the Empire of Nicea in his peace treaty with Theodore. Theodore conquered western [[Paphlagonia]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast from Alexios{{nbsp}}I Komnenos. Around 1220, Theodore tried to persuade the Latins of Constantinople to acknowledge his rule, but they refused. Theodore established a powerful state, located in the vicinity of Constantinople, which enabled his successors to expel the Latins from the city and revive the Byzantine Empire in 1261.\n\n== Early life ==\n\n=== Parentage ===\n\nTheodore Komnenos Laskaris was born to a noble but not particularly renowned Byzantine family around 1175.<ref group=\"note\">Akropolites stated that Theodore was \"more than 45&nbsp;years old but less than 50\" when he died in 1221, implying that he was born between 1171 and 1176.
