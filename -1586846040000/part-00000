It is considered one of the most famous rivalries in the NFL.<ref name=\"ESPN\">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=3086647&type=story|title=Ranking the NFL's best rivalries: Where does Colts-Pats fit?|work=[[ESPN.com]]|first=Jeffri|last=Chadiha|date=2007-10-31|accessdate=2009-01-24}}</ref> The two teams have combined for seven [[Super Bowl]] victories (six by the Patriots) and ten [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship]]s (eight by the Patriots) since [[2001 NFL season|2001]], while both are noted for their organizational excellence.<ref name=\"ESPN\" />\n\nThe nature of this rivalry is somewhat ironic because while the Colts and Patriots were [[AFC East]] division rivals from 1970\u20132001 (dating prior to the [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|Colts' move]] from [[Baltimore]] to [[Indianapolis]]), their intensified enmity was not prevalent until Indianapolis was moved into the newly formed [[AFC South]] following the 2001 season as part of the NFL's realignment.<ref name=\"ESPN\" /> Following New England's 43\u201322 win in [[2013\u201314 NFL playoffs|the 2013\u201314 playoffs]] the Patriots lead the series with nine wins (three in the playoffs) versus five wins (one playoff) for the Colts, and the Patriots hold a lead in points scored, 411\u2013351.\n\nThe modern matchup spanning the period of [[2001 NFL season|2001]]\u2013[[2011 NFL season|2011]] was usually headlined as a [[Brady-Manning rivalry|contest]] between quarterbacks [[Peyton Manning]] and [[Tom Brady]], who together won six NFL MVP awards in eight years (2003\u201310; four by Manning). In September 2001 Brady received his first start against the Colts after an injury to then-starter [[Drew Bledsoe]], and proceeded to defeat the Colts in his first six games against them in the next years, including the 2003 AFC Championship Game and a [[2004\u201305 NFL playoffs|2004 AFC Divisional playoff game]]. The 2004 Divisional game was notable as the Patriots held a record breaking Colts offense to 3 points on snowy cold night in Foxborough. The Colts won the next three matches, notching two regular season victories and a win in the 2006 AFC Championship Game on the way to their win in [[Super Bowl XLI]]. Since then, the Patriots have won the six out of the next eight games from 2007\u201314. The quarterback angle of the rivalry changed in 2012 following Manning's release from the team, and with the surge to success of Colts rookie [[Andrew Luck]].  The rivalry gained momentum again in February 2018, when Patriots offensive coordinator [[Josh McDaniels]], who had agreed to become the head coach of the Colts, went back on his word and decided to stay on as a coordinator in New England.\n\n==Rivalry statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!\n!Patriots wins\n!Ties\n!Colts wins\n!Patriots points\n!Colts

The Patriots and Colts were both wild card teams at the end of the 2006 season, the first time in the series history that they had met in the playoffs as wild cards. New England was coming off of wins over the Jets and Chargers, and finished the 2006 season with a 12-4 record. The Colts were also 12-4, but finished ahead of the Patriots by virtue of their head-to-head win over them during the regular season in Foxborough. The Colts were coming off wins over the Chiefs and Ravens. In this game, the Patriots ran out to a 21-3 lead in the 2nd quarter, but the Colts would pull off a fierce comeback to win 38-34, the largest comeback win in conference championship history at the time.<ref>{http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/games/2007-01-21-patriots-colts_x.htm}</ref> With 1 minute remaining in the game, Joseph Addai rushed in for a touchdown from 3 yards out to give the Colts the lead.

The Patriots had scored over 34 points in every game but the Colts defense stifled the Patriots' attack and Indianapolis clawed to a 20-10 lead in the fourth. But a 58-yard Tom Brady bomb to [[Randy Moss]] was caught at the Colts' 3-yard line, leading to a [[Wes Welker]] touchdown catch. After stopping Manning and forcing a punt, a strong kick return by Welker set up a three-play touchdown drive highlighted by a 32-yard catch by [[Dont\u00e9 Stallworth]] and a [[Kevin Faulk]] touchdown catch. Manning was hit and threw the ball into the hands of [[Rosevelt Colvin]] on the next Colts drive and the Patriots ran out the remaining clock for the 24-20 win.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This win was number 9 in the Patriots' 16-0 regular season.\n\n* '''November 15, 2009 (4th and 2 Game)''':\nThe undefeated Indianapolis Colts again played the 6-2 New England Patriots in what was Tom Brady's first start at Lucas Oil Stadium. With 4:12 left in the fourth quarter, the Patriots had pulled away 34-21. A pass interference call against New England set up a four-yard touchdown run by Colts RB [[Joseph Addai]] with 2:23 left. Leading 34-28, but backed up on their own 28-yard-line and needing to reach the 30-yard-line for a first down, Patriots coach [[Bill Belichick]] elected to go for it on 4th and 2 instead of punting. Brady completed a pass to halfback Kevin Faulk, but Faulk appeared not to make a clean catch and was immediately driven backwards. Officials determined that Faulk had not secured possession of the ball until he was short of the first down marker, resulting in a turnover on downs, and giving Manning and the Colts the ball on the Patriots' own 29-yard line with two minutes remaining. After three plays, Manning completed a one-yard touchdown pass to [[Reggie Wayne]], making the score even at 34-34 with 13 seconds left. Kicker [[Matt Stover]], filling in for Adam Vinatieri, made the extra point to make the score 35-34 and secured the victory for Indianapolis.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nBelichick obliquely criticized the ball-spot on the play in his Monday morning press conference.

The controversy was addressed by [[Bill Belichick]] in a snap press conference a week before [[Super Bowl XLIX]] and took a bizarre turn when [[Adam Schefter]] reported a league employee was fired after this game for stealing footballs and illegally selling them.\n\n==Connections between the teams==\n*[[Upton Bell]] was personnel director of the Colts in their first two Super Bowl appearances ([[Super Bowl III|III]] and [[Super Bowl V|V]]) and in 1971 took over as GM of the Patriots on the recommendation of Colts team owner [[Carroll Rosenbloom]]. Bell clashed with coach [[John Mazur]] because Mazur objected to Bell's policy of picking up waiver-wire free agents for him to train during the season. Eventually the two all but stopped speaking (the corridor between their two offices at Schaefer Stadium became known as \"the [[demilitarized zone|DMZ]]\")<ref>See \"Welcome To The DMZ\" in Fox, Larry (1979) The New England Patriots Triumph & Tragedy (New York: Atheneum)</ref> and Bell wanted to fire Mazur; the Patriots' board of directors agreed to the move provided the Patriots lost to the Colts by more than seven points in the 1971 season finale. Bell expected the Colts to win, since he knew the Colts team having helped build it, but instead of losing, Jim Plunkett's 88-yard touchdown pass caught by [[Randy Vataha]] made for a 21-17 Patriots win. Bell was heard furiously screaming for Vataha not to score, for the win guaranteed Mazur would continue as coach for 1972. Mazur and Bell were both released in the 1972 season.\n*[[Ron Meyer]] coached the Patriots from 1982 until mid-October 1984. He became coach of the Colts in December 1986 until October 1991, leading the team to a 36-35 record and one playoff appearance, in the 1987 AFC Divisional Playoffs where the Colts lost 38-21 to the [[Cleveland Browns]]. Meyer was fired after the Colts lost their first five games of 1991. His record against the Patriots in nine games was 3-6.\n*Before leading the Patriots to seven Super Bowl appearances and five Super Bowl wins as head coach, Bill Belichick's first job in the National Football League was as an assistant with the Baltimore Colts in [[1975 NFL season|1975]] under head coach [[Ted Marchibroda]]. In [[1996 NFL season|1996]], Belichick, then the head coach of the Cleveland Browns, returned to Baltimore following the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|Browns relocation]] but was fired shortly after the move. He was replaced by Marchibroda, who had just completed a four-season stint with the Indianapolis Colts. Belichick then took his first job with the Patriots, becoming an assistant under head coach [[Bill Parcells]] for the 1996 season.\n*Kicker [[Adam Vinatieri]] made the iconic winning field goal against the St. Louis Rams in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] with the Patriots and also played with them in three other Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl XXXI|XXXI]], [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|XXXVIII]], and [[Super Bowl XXXIX|XXXIX]]), winning three in total out of four. After the 2005 season, the Patriots chose not to place the franchise tag on Vinatieri as they had the year before, allowing him to become a free agent. He joined the Colts in 2006 and won [[Super Bowl XLI|the subsequent Super Bowl]] with them to earn his fourth ring. He was injured during the 2009 season, and did not play in [[Super Bowl XLIV]], which the Colts lost 31-17 to the [[New Orleans Saints]].\n*Raymond Berry was one of the most famous receivers in Colts history when they played in Baltimore. He joined the Patriots coaching staff under [[Chuck Fairbanks]] and became head coach in 1984; among his first wins was a 50-17 triumph versus the Colts in New England's first ever trip to Indianapolis. Berry went 10-2 against the Colts as Patriots head coach, including season sweeps in 1984-86 and 1989.\n*[[Jim E. Mora]] worked for the Patriots in 1982 under head coach Ron Meyer and became Colts head coach from 1998\u20132001; his record against the Patriots was 2-6.\n*In [[2009 NFL season|2009]], the Colts finished the regular season 14-2 with the best record in the NFL, and an AP MVP award for starting quarterback Peyton Manning, while the Patriots finished the season 10-6 receiving the No. 3 seed. The exact reverse would occur [[2010 NFL season|the following season]], with the Patriots' starting quarterback Tom Brady winning AP MVP honors. None of the teams though, would win a Super Bowl. The [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|2009 Colts]] were defeated by the [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] in [[Super Bowl XLIV]] while the [[2010 New England Patriots season|2010 Patriots]] were knocked out in the Divisional Playoffs by [[Mark Sanchez]] and divisional rival [[2010 New York Jets season|New York Jets]], who had narrowly defeated the [[2010 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]] 17-16 in the Wild Card round a week earlier on a last-second field goal.\n*The Patriots played [[Super Bowl XLVI]] at Lucas Oil Stadium, the Colts' home field and were defeated by the [[New York Giants]] and quarterback [[Eli Manning]], the younger brother of Peyton Manning. Manning and the Giants previously beat the Patriots in [[Super Bowl XLII]]. The majority of Colts fans rooted for Eli Manning and the Giants over their arch-rivals.\n*Joseph Addai was the starting running back for the Colts for the most part from 2006\u20132011. After the 2011 season, he was released and then signed a one-year contract with the Patriots in May 2012; however he was cut before taking a snap in 2012 training camp.\n*[[Austin Collie]] played his first four years in the NFL with the Colts, catching 173 passes for sixteen touchdowns (118 of his catches and fifteen of his touchdowns were from Manning); Collie signed with the Patriots in 2013; in his first game two late catches for first downs set up the game-winning score for the Patriots against [[2013 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans]].  He was released during the season but re-signed in December for the 2013 playoffs; his 15-yard catch late in the fourth quarter of the divisional playoff against the Colts set up a late [[Stevan Ridley]] touchdown.\n*[[Deion Branch]] was a two-time Super Bowl Champion with the Patriots during his time with the team from 2003\u20132005, and was the [[Super Bowl MVP|MVP]] of [[Super Bowl XXXIX]]. He also played in one other Super Bowl for the Patriots after returning for three seasons from 2010\u20132012. On January 6, 2014, five days before the Colts were set to play the Patriots in a Divisional round game, Branch signed with Indianapolis. He was inactive during the Colts 43-22 playoff loss.\n*[[Reggie Wayne]] played his first fourteen seasons (2001\u201314) with the Colts; against the Patriots he caught 67 passes on 118 targets for 897 yards and five touchdowns; his touchdown with thirteen seconds to go won the [[4th and 2]] game for the Colts in 2009.  On August 24, 2015 Wayne signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the Patriots<ref>[http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/08/25/reggie-wayne-whoever-the-naysayers-are-watch-me-work Reggie Wayne on signing with the Patriots] from [[Pro Football Talk]]</ref> but was cut on September 5, 2015.\n*Quarterback [[Jacoby Brissett]] was drafted by the Patriots in 2016 and played in three games in that season with wins over the [[2016 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] coming off the bench and against the [[2016 Houston Texans season|Texans]] as starter.  After a five-touchdown performance against the [[2017 New York Giants season|NY Giants]] in the 2017 preseason with the Patriots he was traded to the Colts for receiver [[Phillip Dorsett]]<ref>[http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2017/09/02/patriots-trade-jacoby-brissett-to-colts-for-phillip-dorsett Patriots trade Brissett to Colts] from [[Pro Football Talk]]</ref> after a season-ending ACL tear to Patriots' star receiver [[Julian Edelman]].  Brissett became Colts starter in 2019 following the unexpected retirement of [[Andrew Luck]]. \n*[[Josh McDaniels]] agreed to become Colts head coach for [[2018 Indianapolis Colts season|2018]] and even began hiring a staff such as assistant coach [[Joe Judge (American football)|Joe Judge]], but on February 7, a day the Colts officially announced him as head coach, he abruptly backed out of the deal to stay with the Patriots.

It is considered one of the most famous rivalries in the NFL.<ref name=\"ESPN\">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=3086647&type=story|title=Ranking the NFL's best rivalries: Where does Colts-Pats fit?|work=[[ESPN.com]]|first=Jeffri|last=Chadiha|date=2007-10-31|accessdate=2009-01-24}}</ref> The two teams have combined for seven [[Super Bowl]] victories (six by the Patriots) and ten [[AFC Championship Game|AFC Championship]]s (eight by the Patriots) since [[2001 NFL season|2001]], while both are noted for their organizational excellence.<ref name=\"ESPN\" />\n\nThe nature of this rivalry is somewhat ironic because while the Colts and Patriots were [[AFC East]] division rivals from 1970\u20132001 (dating prior to the [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|Colts' move]] from [[Baltimore]] to [[Indianapolis]]), their intensified enmity was not prevalent until Indianapolis was moved into the newly formed [[AFC South]] following the 2001 season as part of the NFL's realignment.<ref name=\"ESPN\" /> Following New England's 43\u201322 win in [[2013\u201314 NFL playoffs|the 2013\u201314 playoffs]] the Patriots lead the series with nine wins (three in the playoffs) versus five wins (one playoff) for the Colts, and the Patriots hold a lead in points scored, 411\u2013351.\n\nThe modern matchup spanning the period of [[2001 NFL season|2001]]\u2013[[2011 NFL season|2011]] was usually headlined as a [[Brady-Manning rivalry|contest]] between quarterbacks [[Peyton Manning]] and [[Tom Brady]], who together won six NFL MVP awards in eight years (2003\u201310; four by Manning). In September 2001 Brady received his first start against the Colts after an injury to then-starter [[Drew Bledsoe]], and proceeded to defeat the Colts in his first six games against them in the next years, including the 2003 AFC Championship Game and a [[2004\u201305 NFL playoffs|2004 AFC Divisional playoff game]]. The 2004 Divisional game was notable as the Patriots held a record breaking Colts offense to 3 points on snowy cold night in Foxborough. The Colts won the next three matches, notching two regular season victories and a win in the 2006 AFC Championship Game on the way to their win in [[Super Bowl XLI]]. Since then, the Patriots have won the six out of the next eight games from 2007\u201314. The quarterback angle of the rivalry changed in 2012 following Manning's release from the team, and with the surge to success of Colts rookie [[Andrew Luck]].  The rivalry gained momentum again in February 2018, when Patriots offensive coordinator [[Josh McDaniels]], who had agreed to become the head coach of the Colts, went back on his word and decided to stay on as a coordinator in New England.\n\n==Rivalry statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!\n!Patriots wins\n!Ties\n!Colts wins\n!Patriots points\n!Colts

The Patriots and Colts were both wild card teams at the end of the 2006 season, the first time in the series history that they had met in the playoffs as wild cards. New England was coming off of wins over the Jets and Chargers, and finished the 2006 season with a 12-4 record. The Colts were also 12-4, but finished ahead of the Patriots by virtue of their head-to-head win over them during the regular season in Foxborough. The Colts were coming off wins over the Chiefs and Ravens. In this game, the Patriots ran out to a 21-3 lead in the 2nd quarter, but the Colts would pull off a fierce comeback to win 38-34, the largest comeback win in conference championship history at the time.<ref>{http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/games/2007-01-21-patriots-colts_x.htm}</ref> With 1 minute remaining in the game, Joseph Addai rushed in for a touchdown from 3 yards out to give the Colts the lead. The game was sealed with an interception by Marlin Jackson with 14 seconds remaining, sending the Colts to the Super Bowl, which they won 29-17 over the Chicago Bears.

The Patriots had scored over 34 points in every game but the Colts defense stifled the Patriots' attack and Indianapolis clawed to a 20-10 lead in the fourth. But a 58-yard Tom Brady bomb to [[Randy Moss]] was caught at the Colts' 3-yard line, leading to a [[Wes Welker]] touchdown catch. After stopping Manning and forcing a punt, a strong kick return by Welker set up a three-play touchdown drive highlighted by a 32-yard catch by [[Dont\u00e9 Stallworth]] and a [[Kevin Faulk]] touchdown catch. Manning was hit and threw the ball into the hands of [[Rosevelt Colvin]] on the next Colts drive and the Patriots ran out the remaining clock for the 24-20 win.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} This win was number 9 in the Patriots' 16-0 regular season.\n\n* '''November 15, 2009 (4th and 2 Game)''':\nThe undefeated Indianapolis Colts again played the 6-2 New England Patriots in what was Tom Brady's first start at Lucas Oil Stadium. With 4:12 left in the fourth quarter, the Patriots had pulled away 34-21. A pass interference call against New England set up a four-yard touchdown run by Colts RB [[Joseph Addai]] with 2:23 left. Leading 34-28, but backed up on their own 28-yard-line and needing to reach the 30-yard-line for a first down, Patriots coach [[Bill Belichick]] elected to go for it on 4th and 2 instead of punting. Brady completed a pass to halfback Kevin Faulk, but Faulk appeared not to make a clean catch and was immediately driven backwards. Officials determined that Faulk had not secured possession of the ball until he was short of the first down marker, resulting in a turnover on downs, and giving Manning and the Colts the ball on the Patriots' own 29-yard line with two minutes remaining. After three plays, Manning completed a one-yard touchdown pass to [[Reggie Wayne]], making the score even at 34-34 with 13 seconds left. Kicker [[Matt Stover]], filling in for Adam Vinatieri, made the extra point to make the score 35-34 and secured the victory for Indianapolis.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nBelichick obliquely criticized the ball-spot on the play in his Monday morning press conference.

The controversy was addressed by [[Bill Belichick]] in a snap press conference a week before [[Super Bowl XLIX]] and took a bizarre turn when [[Adam Schefter]] reported a league employee was fired after this game for stealing footballs and illegally selling them.\n\n==Connections between the teams==\n*[[Upton Bell]] was personnel director of the Colts in their first two Super Bowl appearances ([[Super Bowl III|III]] and [[Super Bowl V|V]]) and in 1971 took over as GM of the Patriots on the recommendation of Colts team owner [[Carroll Rosenbloom]]. Bell clashed with coach [[John Mazur]] because Mazur objected to Bell's policy of picking up waiver-wire free agents for him to train during the season. Eventually the two all but stopped speaking (the corridor between their two offices at Schaefer Stadium became known as \"the [[demilitarized zone|DMZ]]\")<ref>See \"Welcome To The DMZ\" in Fox, Larry (1979) The New England Patriots Triumph & Tragedy (New York: Atheneum)</ref> and Bell wanted to fire Mazur; the Patriots' board of directors agreed to the move provided the Patriots lost to the Colts by more than seven points in the 1971 season finale. Bell expected the Colts to win, since he knew the Colts team having helped build it, but instead of losing, Jim Plunkett's 88-yard touchdown pass caught by [[Randy Vataha]] made for a 21-17 Patriots win. Bell was heard furiously screaming for Vataha not to score, for the win guaranteed Mazur would continue as coach for 1972. Mazur and Bell were both released in the 1972 season.\n*[[Ron Meyer]] coached the Patriots from 1982 until mid-October 1984. He became coach of the Colts in December 1986 until October 1991, leading the team to a 36-35 record and one playoff appearance, in the 1987 AFC Divisional Playoffs where the Colts lost 38-21 to the [[Cleveland Browns]]. Meyer was fired after the Colts lost their first five games of 1991. His record against the Patriots in nine games was 3-6.\n*Before leading the Patriots to seven Super Bowl appearances and five Super Bowl wins as head coach, Bill Belichick's first job in the National Football League was as an assistant with the Baltimore Colts in [[1975 NFL season|1975]] under head coach [[Ted Marchibroda]]. In [[1996 NFL season|1996]], Belichick, then the head coach of the Cleveland Browns, returned to Baltimore following the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|Browns relocation]] but was fired shortly after the move. He was replaced by Marchibroda, who had just completed a four-season stint with the Indianapolis Colts. Belichick then took his first job with the Patriots, becoming an assistant under head coach [[Bill Parcells]] for the 1996 season.\n*Kicker [[Adam Vinatieri]] made the iconic winning field goal against the St. Louis Rams in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] with the Patriots and also played with them in three other Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl XXXI|XXXI]], [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|XXXVIII]], and [[Super Bowl XXXIX|XXXIX]]), winning three in total out of four. After the 2005 season, the Patriots chose not to place the franchise tag on Vinatieri as they had the year before, allowing him to become a free agent. He joined the Colts in 2006 and won [[Super Bowl XLI|the subsequent Super Bowl]] with them to earn his fourth ring. He was injured during the 2009 season, and did not play in [[Super Bowl XLIV]], which the Colts lost 31-17 to the [[New Orleans Saints]].\n*Raymond Berry was one of the most famous receivers in Colts history when they played in Baltimore. He joined the Patriots coaching staff under [[Chuck Fairbanks]] and became head coach in 1984; among his first wins was a 50-17 triumph versus the Colts in New England's first ever trip to Indianapolis. Berry went 10-2 against the Colts as Patriots head coach, including season sweeps in 1984-86 and 1989.\n*[[Jim E. Mora]] worked for the Patriots in 1982 under head coach Ron Meyer and became Colts head coach from 1998\u20132001; his record against the Patriots was 2-6.\n*In [[2009 NFL season|2009]], the Colts finished the regular season 14-2 with the best record in the NFL, and an AP MVP award for starting quarterback Peyton Manning, while the Patriots finished the season 10-6 receiving the No. 3 seed. The exact reverse would occur [[2010 NFL season|the following season]], with the Patriots' starting quarterback Tom Brady winning AP MVP honors. None of the teams though, would win a Super Bowl. The [[2009 Indianapolis Colts season|2009 Colts]] were defeated by the [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] in [[Super Bowl XLIV]] while the [[2010 New England Patriots season|2010 Patriots]] were knocked out in the Divisional Playoffs by [[Mark Sanchez]] and divisional rival [[2010 New York Jets season|New York Jets]], who had narrowly defeated the [[2010 Indianapolis Colts season|Colts]] 17-16 in the Wild Card round a week earlier on a last-second field goal.\n*The Patriots played [[Super Bowl XLVI]] at Lucas Oil Stadium, the Colts' home field and were defeated by the [[New York Giants]] and quarterback [[Eli Manning]], the younger brother of Peyton Manning. Manning and the Giants previously beat the Patriots in [[Super Bowl XLII]]. The majority of Colts fans rooted for Eli Manning and the Giants over their arch-rivals.\n*Joseph Addai was the starting running back for the Colts for the most part from 2006\u20132011. After the 2011 season, he was released and then signed a one-year contract with the Patriots in May 2012; however he was cut before taking a snap in 2012 training camp.\n*[[Austin Collie]] played his first four years in the NFL with the Colts, catching 173 passes for sixteen touchdowns (118 of his catches and fifteen of his touchdowns were from Manning); Collie signed with the Patriots in 2013; in his first game two late catches for first downs set up the game-winning score for the Patriots against [[2013 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans]].  He was released during the season but re-signed in December for the 2013 playoffs; his 15-yard catch late in the fourth quarter of the divisional playoff against the Colts set up a late [[Stevan Ridley]] touchdown.\n*[[Deion Branch]] was a two-time Super Bowl Champion with the Patriots during his time with the team from 2003\u20132005, and was the [[Super Bowl MVP|MVP]] of [[Super Bowl XXXIX]]. He also played in one other Super Bowl for the Patriots after returning for three seasons from 2010\u20132012. On January 6, 2014, five days before the Colts were set to play the Patriots in a Divisional round game, Branch signed with Indianapolis. He was inactive during the Colts 43-22 playoff loss.\n*[[Reggie Wayne]] played his first fourteen seasons (2001\u201314) with the Colts; against the Patriots he caught 67 passes on 118 targets for 897 yards and five touchdowns; his touchdown with thirteen seconds to go won the [[4th and 2]] game for the Colts in 2009.  On August 24, 2015 Wayne signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the Patriots<ref>[http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/08/25/reggie-wayne-whoever-the-naysayers-are-watch-me-work Reggie Wayne on signing with the Patriots] from [[Pro Football Talk]]</ref> but was cut on September 5, 2015.\n*Quarterback [[Jacoby Brissett]] was drafted by the Patriots in 2016 and played in three games in that season with wins over the [[2016 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] coming off the bench and against the [[2016 Houston Texans season|Texans]] as starter.
