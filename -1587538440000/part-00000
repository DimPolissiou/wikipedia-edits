In addition to letter grades and percentages, the Ministry of Education also uses a level system to marks its students. The four levels correspond to how students are marked on the [[Ontario rubric]]. The following is the levels on the Ontario rubric, its meaning, and its corresponding letter/percentage grades:\n* Level 4, beyond government standards (A; 80 percent and above)\n* Level 3, at government standards (B; 70\u201379 percent)\n* Level 2, approaching government standards (C; 60\u201369 percent)\n* Level 1, well below government standards (D; 50\u201359 percent)\nThe grading standards for A-letter grades changed in September 2010 to coincide with a new academic year. The new changes require a higher percentage grade by two or five points to obtain an A or A+ respectively.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! Letter !!

Bikram era was initiated when a brave and victorian Suryabanshi king established his capital at Bishalnagar and Battaishputali (Himabatkhand). Here is another proof that the Bikram era was started in Nepal from an unknown ancient time. Just near above to a temple of Sankhu Bajrayogini there is another temple in which the head of King Bikramaditya has been kept.\n\n=== {{anchor|Historical Origins}}Historical origins ===\nThe association of the era beginning in 57 BCE with Vikramaditya is not found in any source before the 9th century CE; earlier sources call the era \"K\u1e5b\u1e6da\" (343 and 371 CE), \"Kritaa\" (404), \"the era of the [[Malavas|Malava tribe]]\" (424), or simply \"Samvat\".<ref name=\"AA_1989\"/><ref name=\"MS_1974\"/> The earliest known inscription which calls the era \"Vikrama\" is from 842. This inscription, from the [[Chauhan]]a ruler Chandamahasena, was found at [[Dholpur]] and is dated \"Vikrama Samvat 898, [[Vaishakha]] [[Shukla paksha|Shukla]] 2, Chanda\" (16 April 842). The earliest known inscription which associates the era with a king called Vikramaditya is dated 971, and the earliest literary work connecting the era to Vikramaditya is ''Subhashita-Ratna-Sandoha'' (993-994) by the Jain author Amitagati.<ref name=\"MS_1974\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4dVRvVyHaiQC&pg=PA100 |title=History of Classical Sanskrit Literature |author=M.

This is not true. Chandra Gupta II in the fourth century became king of Ujjayani. He captured Ayodhdhya in around 400 AD and made his capital. He then pasted himself on copper coins as \u2018Bikramaditya\u2019. But the same Chandra Gupta declaring himself decorated Bikramaditya, but he was not being the originator of Bikram Samat.\nIn fact, since Gupta kings of Magadh were influenced by Lichchhavis of Nepal, Chandra Gupta I married a princess of Lichchhavis king. Therefore due to the influence of the bravery of Lichchhavi Kings, Chandra Gupta II might have decorated himself as \u2018Bikramaditya\u2019.\nStill, the logic is not valid that Bikram Sambat started from India as Chandra Gupta II was decorated as Bikramaditya. The famous historian Baburam Acharya has written \u2018During 58 BC when Bikram Era was begun, there is no proof of the existence of King Bikramaditya in Ujjayani of India. No proof was established when of excavates of Ujjayani were studied.\u201d In this situation, it is proved that Bikram Sambat is not originated from India.

The enraged monk sought the help of the \u015aaka ruler King Sahi in [[Sistan]]. Despite heavy odds but aided by miracles, the \u015aaka king defeated Gandharvasena and made him a captive. Sarasvati was repatriated, although Gandharvasena himself was forgiven. The defeated king retired to the forest, where he was killed by a tiger. His son, Vikramaditya, being brought up in the forest, had to rule from [[Pratishthana]] (modern Paithan in [[Maharashtra]]). Later on, Vikramaditya invaded Ujjain and drove away from the \u015aakas. To commemorate this event, he started a new era called the \"Vikrama era\". The Ujjain calendar started around 58\u201356 BCE, and the subsequent Shaka-era calendar was started in 78 CE at Pratishthana.{{full citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== {{anchor|Historical Origins}}Historical origins ===\nThe association of the era beginning in 57 BCE with Vikramaditya is not found in any source before the 9th century CE; earlier sources call the era \"K\u1e5b\u1e6da\" (343 and 371 CE), \"Kritaa\" (404), \"the era of the [[Malavas|Malava tribe]]\" (424), or simply \"Samvat\".<ref name=\"AA_1989\"/><ref name=\"MS_1974\"/> The earliest known inscription which calls the era \"Vikrama\" is from 842.

The earliest known inscription which associates the era with a king called Vikramaditya is dated 971, and the earliest literary work connecting the era to Vikramaditya is ''Subhashita-Ratna-Sandoha'' (993-994) by the Jain author Amitagati.<ref name=\"MS_1974\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4dVRvVyHaiQC&pg=PA100 |title=History of Classical Sanskrit Literature |author=M.
