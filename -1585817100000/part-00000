The proposal was not approved to due to concerns over national security and negative cultural influence. In 1997, the [[Government of India]] banned DTH services when [[Rupert Murdoch]]-owned Indian Sky Broadcasting (ISkyB) was about to launch its DTH services in the country.<ref name=\"Rediff1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/2004/mar/23spec.htm|title=What is DTH?|website=www.rediff.com|access-date=2016-10-01}}</ref> After deliberations among groups of ministers, DTH services were permitted by the [[Third Vajpayee ministry|NDA government]] in November 2000. The ministers made four key recommendations to govern DTH services: no single entity, either private or state-owned, should be permitted a [[monopoly]] in DTH services; the [[vertical integration]] of DTH and [[cable television]] services should be monitored in order to prevent the formation of a monopoly in television distribution; the vertical integration of DTH operators and television channels should be avoided in order to ensure fair competition among TV channels.\n\nThe new policy announced in November 2000 required all DTH operators to set up earth stations in India within 12 months of receiving a license. DTH licenses were priced at $2.14 million with a validity of 10 years. The FDI limit in the DTH sector was capped at 49%, and the company operating the services was required to be headed by an Indian citizen.<ref name=\"Rediff1\"/>\n\n=== Early years ===\nThe first DTH service was launched in India on 2 October 2003 by [[Dish TV]] owned by [[Zee Entertainment Enterprises|Zee]].

The ministers made four key recommendations to govern DTH services: no single entity, either private or state-owned, should be permitted a [[monopoly]] in DTH services; the [[vertical integration]] of DTH and [[cable television]] services should be monitored in order to prevent the formation of a monopoly in television distribution; the vertical integration of DTH operators and television channels should be avoided in order to ensure fair competition among TV channels.\n\nThe new policy announced in November 2000 required all DTH operators to set up earth stations in India within 12 months of receiving a license. DTH licenses were priced at $2.14 million with a validity of 10 years.

Interfaces enable [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphic]] behavior. Classes implementing the identified interfaces are built and added to [[business domain]] classes as needed. Thus, system behaviors are realized without inheritance. \n\nIn fact, business domain classes may all be base classes without any inheritance at all. Alternative implementation of system behaviors is accomplished by providing another class that implements the desired behavior interface. A class that contains a reference to an interface can support implementations of the interface - a choice that can be delayed until run time.\n\n==Example==\n\n===Inheritance===\nAn example in [[C++11]] follows:\n\n<source lang=Cpp>\n#include <vector>\n\nclass Model;\n\nclass GameObject {\n public:\n  virtual ~GameObject() = default;\n\n  virtual void Update() {}\n  virtual void Draw() {}\n  virtual void Collide(const std::vector<GameObject*>& objects) {}\n};\n\nclass Visible : public GameObject {\n public:\n  void Draw() override {\n    // Draw |model_| at position of this object.\n  };\n\n private:\n  Model* model_;\n};\n\nclass Solid : public GameObject {\n public:\n  void Collide(const std::vector<GameObject*>& objects) override {\n    // Check and react to collisions with |objects|.\n  };\n};\n\nclass Movable : public GameObject {\n public:\n  void Update() override {\n    // Update position.\n  };\n};\n</source>\n\nThen, we have concrete classes:\n\n* class <code>Player</code> - which is <code>Solid</code>, <code>Movable</code> and <code>Visible</code>\n* class <code>Cloud</code> - which is <code>Movable</code> and <code>Visible</code>, but not <code>Solid</code>\n* class <code>Building</code> - which is <code>Solid</code> and <code>Visible</code>, but not <code>Movable</code>\n* class <code>Trap</code> - which is <code>Solid</code>, but neither <code>Visible</code> nor <code>Movable</code>\n\nNote that multiple inheritance is dangerous if not implemented carefully, as it can lead to the [[diamond problem]]. One solution to avoid this is to create classes such as <code>VisibleAndSolid</code>, <code>VisibleAndMovable</code>, <code>VisibleAndSolidAndMovable</code>, etc. for every needed combination, though this leads to a large amount of repetitive code. Keep in mind that C++ solves the diamond problem of multiple inheritance by allowing [[virtual inheritance]].\n\n=== Composition and interfaces ===\nThe following C# example demonstrates the principle of using composition and interfaces to achieve code reuse and polymorphism.\n\n<source lang=\"CSharp\">\nclass Program {\n    static void Main() {\n        var player = new GameObject(new Visible(), new Movable(), new Solid());\n        player.Update(); player.Collide(); player.Draw();\n\n        var cloud = new GameObject(new Visible(), new Movable(), new NotSolid());\n        cloud.Update(); cloud.Collide(); cloud.Draw();\n\n        var building = new GameObject(new Visible(), new NotMovable(), new Solid());\n        building.Update(); building.Collide(); building.Draw();\n\n        var trap = new GameObject(new Invisible(), new NotMovable(), new Solid());\n        trap.Update(); trap.Collide(); trap.Draw();\n    }\n}\n\ninterface IVisible {\n    void Draw();\n}\n\nclass Invisible : IVisible {\n    public void Draw() {\n        Console.Write(\"I won't appear.\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass Visible : IVisible {\n    public void Draw() {\n        Console.Write(\"I'm showing myself.\");\n    }\n}\n\ninterface ICollidable {\n    void Collide();\n}\n\nclass Solid : ICollidable {\n    public void Collide() {\n        Console.Write(\"Bang!\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass NotSolid : ICollidable {\n    public void Collide() {\n        Console.Write(\"Splash!\");\n    }\n}\n\ninterface IUpdatable {\n    void Update();\n}\n\nclass Movable : IUpdatable {\n    public void Update() {\n        Console.Write(\"Moving forward.\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass NotMovable : IUpdatable {\n    public void Update() {\n        Console.Write(\"I'm staying put.\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass GameObject : IVisible, IUpdatable, ICollidable {\n    private readonly IVisible _visible;\n    private readonly IUpdatable _updatable;\n    private readonly ICollidable _collidable;\n\n    public GameObject(IVisible visible, IUpdatable updatable, ICollidable collidable) {\n        _visible = visible;\n        _updatable = updatable;\n        _collidable = collidable;\n    }\n\n    public void Update() {\n        _updatable.Update();\n    }\n\n    public void Draw() {\n        _visible.Draw();\n    }\n\n    public void Collide() {\n        _collidable.Collide();\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\n==Benefits==\nTo favor composition over inheritance is a design principle that gives the design higher flexibility. It is more natural to build business-domain classes out of various components than trying to find commonality between them and creating a family tree. For example, an accelerator pedal and a steering wheel share very few common traits, yet both are vital components in a car. What they can do and how they can be used to benefit the car is easily defined. Composition also provides a more stable business domain in the long term as it is less prone to the quirks of the family members. In other words, it is better to compose what an object can do (''[[HAS-A]]'') than extend what it is (''[[IS-A]]'').<ref name=FHDPs>{{cite book\n | last1         = Freeman\n | first1        = Eric\n | last2         = Robson\n | first2        = Elisabeth \n | last3         = Sierra\n | first3        = Kathy\n | last4         = Bates\n | first4        = Bert\n | year          = 2004\n | title         = Head First Design Patterns\n | page          = 23\n | publisher     = O'Reilly\n | isbn          = 978-0-596-00712-6\n}}</ref>\n\nInitial design is simplified by identifying system object behaviors in separate interfaces instead of creating a hierarchical relationship to distribute behaviors among business-domain classes via inheritance. This approach more easily accommodates future requirements changes that would otherwise require a complete restructuring of business-domain classes in the inheritance model. Additionally, it avoids problems often associated with relatively minor changes to an inheritance-based model that includes several generations of classes.\n\nSome languages, notably [[Go (programming language)|Go]], use type composition exclusively.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html |title=Less is exponentially more |last1=Pike |first1=Rob |date=2012-06-25 |accessdate=2016-10-01 }}</ref>\n\n==Drawbacks==\nOne common drawback of using composition instead of inheritance is that methods being provided by individual components may have to be implemented in the derived type, even if they are only [[Forwarding (object-oriented programming)|forwarding methods]] ''(this is true in most programming languages, but not all; see [[#Avoiding_Drawbacks|caveats]].)'' In contrast, inheritance does not require all of the base class's methods to be re-implemented within the derived class. Rather, the derived class only needs to implement (override) the methods having different behavior than the base class methods. This can require significantly less programming effort if the base class contains many methods providing default behavior and only a few of them need to be overridden within the derived class.\n\nFor example, in the C# code below, the variables and methods of the {{code|Employee}} base class are inherited by the {{code|HourlyEmployee}} and {{code|SalariedEmployee}} derived subclasses. Only the {{code|Pay()}} method needs to be implemented (specialized) by each derived subclass. The other methods are implemented by the base class itself, and are shared by all of its derived subclasses; they do not need to be re-implemented (overridden) or even mentioned in the subclass definitions.\n\n<source lang=\"csharp\">\n// Base class\npublic abstract class Employee\n{\n    // Properties\n    protected string Name { get; set; }\n    protected int ID { get; set; }\n    protected decimal PayRate { get; set; }\n    protected int HoursWorked { get; }\n\n    // Get pay for the current pay period\n    public abstract decimal Pay();\n}\n\n// Derived subclass\npublic class HourlyEmployee : Employee\n{\n    // Get pay for the current pay period\n    public override decimal Pay()\n    {\n        // Time worked is in hours\n        return HoursWorked * PayRate;\n    }\n}\n\n// Derived subclass\npublic class SalariedEmployee : Employee\n{\n    // Get pay for the current pay period\n    public override decimal Pay()\n    {\n        // Pay rate is annual salary instead of hourly rate\n        return HoursWorked * PayRate / 2087;\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\n=== Avoiding drawbacks ===\nThis drawback can be avoided by using [[Traits (computer science)|traits]], [[mixin]]s, ''(type)'' [[embedding]], or [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocol]] extensions. \n\nSome languages provide specific means to mitigate this:\n\n* [[Raku (programming language)|Raku]] provides a <code>handles</code> keyword to facilitate method forwarding.\n* [[Java (programming language)|Java]] provides Project Lombok<ref>http://projectlombok.org/</ref> which allows delegation to be implemented using a single @Delegate annotation on the field, instead of copying and maintaining the names and types of all the methods from the delegated field.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://projectlombok.org/features/Delegate.html | title=@Delegate | website=Project Lombok | access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref> \n* [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]] macros can be used to generate forwarding methods.  Several implementations exist such as [https://github.com/MikeInnes/Lazy.jl Lazy.jl] and [https://github.com/JeffreySarnoff/TypedDelegation.jl TypedDelegation.jl]. \n* [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]] extensions can be used to define a default implementation of a protocol on the protocol itself, rather than within an individual type's implementation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Protocols.html | title=Protocols | website=The Swift Programming Language | publisher=Apple Inc | access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref> \n* [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]] includes the delegation pattern in the language syntax.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/delegated-properties.html | title=Delegated Properties | website=Kotlin Reference | publisher=JetBrains | access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref> \n* [[Go (programming language)|Go]] type embedding avoids the need for forwarding methods.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#embedding | title=''(Type)'' Embedding | website=The Go Programming Language Documentation | publisher=Google | access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref> \n* [[D (programming language)|D]] provides an explicit \"alias this\" declaration within a type can forward into it every method and member of another contained type. <ref>{{cite web | url=https://dlang.org/spec/class.html#alias-this | title=Alias This | website=D Language Reference| access-date=2019-06-15}}</ref>\n* [[C_Sharp (programming language)|C#]] provides default interface methods since 8.0 version which allows to define body to interface member. <ref>{{cite web | url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-8#default-interface-methods | title=What's new in C# 8.0 | website=Microsoft Docs | publisher=Microsoft | access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>\n*[[Rust (programming language)|Rust]] provides traits with default implementations.\n\n==Empirical studies==\nA 2013 study of 93 open source Java programs (of varying size) found that:\n\n{{quote|While there is not huge [sic] opportunity to replace inheritance with composition (...), the opportunity is significant (median of 2% of uses [of inheritance] are only internal reuse, and a further 22% are only external or internal reuse).\n\nOur results suggest there is no need for concern regarding abuse of inheritance (at least in open-source Java software), but they do highlight the question regarding use of composition versus inheritance.

A class that contains a reference to an interface can support implementations of the interface - a choice that can be delayed until run time.\n\n==Example==\n\n===Inheritance===\nAn example in [[C++11]] follows:\n\n<source lang=Cpp>\n#include <vector>\n\nclass Model;\n\nclass GameObject {\n public:\n  virtual ~GameObject() = default;\n\n  virtual void Update() {}\n  virtual void Draw() {}\n  virtual void Collide(const std::vector<GameObject*>& objects) {}\n};\n\nclass Visible : public GameObject {\n public:\n  void Draw() override {\n    // Draw |model_| at position of this object.\n  };\n\n private:\n  Model* model_;\n};\n\nclass Solid : public GameObject {\n public:\n  void Collide(const std::vector<GameObject*>& objects) override {\n    // Check and react to collisions with |objects|.\n  };\n};\n\nclass Movable : public GameObject {\n public:\n  void Update() override {\n    // Update position.\n  };\n};\n</source>\n\nThen, we have concrete classes:\n\n* class <code>Player</code> - which is <code>Solid</code>, <code>Movable</code> and <code>Visible</code>\n* class <code>Cloud</code> - which is <code>Movable</code> and <code>Visible</code>, but not <code>Solid</code>\n* class <code>Building</code> - which is <code>Solid</code> and <code>Visible</code>, but not <code>Movable</code>\n* class <code>Trap</code> - which is <code>Solid</code>, but neither <code>Visible</code> nor <code>Movable</code>\n\nNote that multiple inheritance is dangerous if not implemented carefully, as it can lead to the [[diamond problem]]. One solution to avoid this is to create classes such as <code>VisibleAndSolid</code>, <code>VisibleAndMovable</code>, <code>VisibleAndSolidAndMovable</code>, etc. for every needed combination, though this leads to a large amount of repetitive code. Keep in mind that C++ solves the diamond problem of multiple inheritance by allowing [[virtual inheritance]].\n\n=== Composition and interfaces ===\nThe following C# example demonstrates the principle of using composition and interfaces to achieve code reuse and polymorphism.\n\n<source lang=\"CSharp\">\nclass Program {\n    static void Main() {\n        var player = new GameObject(new Visible(), new Movable(), new Solid());\n        player.Update(); player.Collide(); player.Draw();\n\n        var cloud = new GameObject(new Visible(), new Movable(), new NotSolid());\n        cloud.Update(); cloud.Collide(); cloud.Draw();\n\n        var building = new GameObject(new Visible(), new NotMovable(), new Solid());\n        building.Update(); building.Collide(); building.Draw();\n\n        var trap = new GameObject(new Invisible(), new NotMovable(), new Solid());\n        trap.Update(); trap.Collide(); trap.Draw();\n    }\n}\n\ninterface IVisible {\n    void Draw();\n}\n\nclass Invisible : IVisible {\n    public void Draw() {\n        Console.Write(\"I won't appear.\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass Visible : IVisible {\n    public void Draw() {\n        Console.Write(\"I'm showing myself.\");\n    }\n}\n\ninterface ICollidable {\n    void Collide();\n}\n\nclass Solid : ICollidable {\n    public void Collide() {\n        Console.Write(\"Bang!\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass NotSolid : ICollidable {\n    public void Collide() {\n        Console.Write(\"Splash!\");\n    }\n}\n\ninterface IUpdatable {\n    void Update();\n}\n\nclass Movable : IUpdatable {\n    public void Update() {\n        Console.Write(\"Moving forward.\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass NotMovable : IUpdatable {\n    public void Update() {\n        Console.Write(\"I'm staying put.\");\n    }\n}\n\nclass GameObject : IVisible, IUpdatable, ICollidable {\n    private readonly IVisible _visible;\n    private readonly IUpdatable _updatable;\n    private readonly ICollidable _collidable;\n\n    public GameObject(IVisible visible, IUpdatable updatable, ICollidable collidable) {\n        _visible = visible;\n        _updatable = updatable;\n        _collidable = collidable;\n    }\n\n    public void Update() {\n        _updatable.Update();\n    }\n\n    public void Draw() {\n        _visible.Draw();\n    }\n\n    public void Collide() {\n        _collidable.Collide();\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\n==Benefits==\nTo favor composition over inheritance is a design principle that gives the design higher flexibility. It is more natural to build business-domain classes out of various components than trying to find commonality between them and creating a family tree. For example, an accelerator pedal and a steering wheel share very few common traits, yet both are vital components in a car. What they can do and how they can be used to benefit the car is easily defined. Composition also provides a more stable business domain in the long term as it is less prone to the quirks of the family members. In other words, it is better to compose what an object can do (''[[HAS-A]]'') than extend what it is (''[[IS-A]]'').<ref name=FHDPs>{{cite book\n | last1         = Freeman\n | first1        = Eric\n | last2         = Robson\n | first2        = Elisabeth \n | last3         = Sierra\n | first3        = Kathy\n | last4         = Bates\n | first4        = Bert\n | year          = 2004\n | title         = Head First Design Patterns\n | page          = 23\n | publisher     = O'Reilly\n | isbn          = 978-0-596-00712-6\n}}</ref>\n\nInitial design is simplified by identifying system object behaviors in separate interfaces instead of creating a hierarchical relationship to distribute behaviors among business-domain classes via inheritance. This approach more easily accommodates future requirements changes that would otherwise require a complete restructuring of business-domain classes in the inheritance model. Additionally, it avoids problems often associated with relatively minor changes to an inheritance-based model that includes several generations of classes.\n\nSome languages, notably [[Go (programming language)|Go]], use type composition exclusively.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html |title=Less is exponentially more |last1=Pike |first1=Rob |date=2012-06-25 |accessdate=2016-10-01 }}</ref>\n\n==Drawbacks==\nOne common drawback of using composition instead of inheritance is that methods being provided by individual components may have to be implemented in the derived type, even if they are only [[Forwarding (object-oriented programming)|forwarding methods]] ''(this is true in most programming languages, but not all; see [[#Avoiding_Drawbacks|caveats]].)'' In contrast, inheritance does not require all of the base class's methods to be re-implemented within the derived class. Rather, the derived class only needs to implement (override) the methods having different behavior than the base class methods. This can require significantly less programming effort if the base class contains many methods providing default behavior and only a few of them need to be overridden within the derived class.\n\nFor example, in the C# code below, the variables and methods of the {{code|Employee}} base class are inherited by the {{code|HourlyEmployee}} and {{code|SalariedEmployee}} derived subclasses. Only the {{code|Pay()}} method needs to be implemented (specialized) by each derived subclass. The other methods are implemented by the base class itself, and are shared by all of its derived subclasses; they do not need to be re-implemented (overridden) or even mentioned in the subclass definitions.\n\n<source lang=\"csharp\">\n// Base class\npublic abstract class Employee\n{\n    // Properties\n    protected string Name { get; set; }\n    protected int ID { get; set; }\n    protected decimal PayRate { get; set; }\n    protected int HoursWorked { get; }\n\n    // Get pay for the current pay period\n    public abstract decimal Pay();\n}\n\n// Derived subclass\npublic class HourlyEmployee : Employee\n{\n    // Get pay for the current pay period\n    public override decimal Pay()\n    {\n        // Time worked is in hours\n        return HoursWorked * PayRate;\n    }\n}\n\n// Derived subclass\npublic class SalariedEmployee : Employee\n{\n    // Get pay for the current pay period\n    public override decimal Pay()\n    {\n        // Pay rate is annual salary instead of hourly rate\n        return HoursWorked * PayRate / 2087;\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\n=== Avoiding drawbacks ===\nThis drawback can be avoided by using [[Traits (computer science)|traits]], [[mixin]]s, ''(type)'' [[embedding]], or [[Protocol (object-oriented programming)|protocol]] extensions. \n\nSome languages provide specific means to mitigate this:\n\n* [[Raku (programming language)|Raku]] provides a <code>handles</code> keyword to facilitate method forwarding.\n* [[Java (programming language)|Java]] provides Project Lombok<ref>http://projectlombok.org/</ref> which allows delegation to be implemented using a single @Delegate annotation on the field, instead of copying and maintaining the names and types of all the methods from the delegated field.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://projectlombok.org/features/Delegate.html | title=@Delegate | website=Project Lombok | access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref> \n* [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]] macros can be used to generate forwarding methods.  Several implementations exist such as [https://github.com/MikeInnes/Lazy.jl Lazy.jl] and [https://github.com/JeffreySarnoff/TypedDelegation.jl TypedDelegation.jl]. \n* [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]] extensions can be used to define a default implementation of a protocol on the protocol itself, rather than within an individual type's implementation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Protocols.html | title=Protocols | website=The Swift Programming Language | publisher=Apple Inc | access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref> \n* [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]] includes the delegation pattern in the language syntax.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/delegated-properties.html | title=Delegated Properties | website=Kotlin Reference | publisher=JetBrains | access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref> \n* [[Go (programming language)|Go]] type embedding avoids the need for forwarding methods.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#embedding | title=''(Type)'' Embedding | website=The Go Programming Language Documentation | publisher=Google | access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref> \n* [[D (programming language)|D]] provides an explicit \"alias this\" declaration within a type can forward into it every method and member of another contained type. <ref>{{cite web | url=https://dlang.org/spec/class.html#alias-this | title=Alias This | website=D Language Reference| access-date=2019-06-15}}</ref>\n* [[C_Sharp (programming language)|C#]] provides default interface methods since 8.0 version which allows to define body to interface member. <ref>{{cite web | url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-8#default-interface-methods | title=What's new in C# 8.0 | website=Microsoft Docs | publisher=Microsoft | access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>\n\n==Empirical studies==\nA 2013 study of 93 open source Java programs (of varying size) found that:\n\n{{quote|While there is not huge [sic] opportunity to replace inheritance with composition (...), the opportunity is significant (median of 2% of uses [of inheritance] are only internal reuse, and a further 22% are only external or internal reuse).\n\nOur results suggest there is no need for concern regarding abuse of inheritance (at least in open-source Java software), but they do highlight the question regarding use of composition versus inheritance.

Therefore, unlike other vegetables and fruits, freshness is not as important.  It should be ''fully matured'' first, in order to become flavorful, by first ripening the kabocha in a warm place (77&nbsp;\u00b0F/25&nbsp;\u00b0C) for 13 days to convert some of the starch to sugar.  Then the kabocha is transferred to a cool place (50&nbsp;\u00b0F/10&nbsp;\u00b0C) and stored for about a month in order to increase carbohydrate content. In this way the just-harvested, dry, bland-tasting kabocha is transformed into a smooth, sweet kabocha. Fully ripened, succulent kabocha will have reddish-yellow flesh, a hard skin, and a dry, corky stem.  It reaches the peak of ripeness about 1.5\u20133 months after it is harvested.<ref>[http://www.nijiya.com/gochiso/english/2006/files/06english.pdf \"Kabocha (Japanese Pumpkin) A Flavor of the Earth\"] [http://www.nijiya.com/gochiso-magazine#english Gochiso Web Magazine], 2006, p. 8</ref>\n\n==History==\nAll [[squash (plant)|squashes]] were domesticated in [[Mesoamerica]].

Some kabocha can taste like [[Russet potato]]es or [[chestnut]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} The rind is edible although some cooks may peel it to speed up the cooking process or to suit their personal taste preferences.  Kabocha is commonly utilized in side dishes and soups, or as a substitute for potato or other squash varieties. It can be roasted after cutting the squash in half, scooping out the seeds, and then cutting the squash into wedges. With a little olive oil and seasoning, it can be baked in the oven. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Likewise, cut Kabocha halves can be added to a pressure cooker and steamed under high pressure for 15\u201320 minutes.\n\nKabocha is available all year but is best in late summer and early fall. \nKabocha is primarily grown in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, California, Florida, Hawaii, [[Southwestern Colorado]], Mexico, [[Tasmania]], [[Tonga]], New Zealand, Chile, Jamaica, and South Africa, but is widely adapted for climates that provide a growing season of 100 days or more.

Therefore, unlike other vegetables and fruits, freshness is not as important.  It should be ''fully matured'' first, in order to become flavorful, by first ripening the kabocha in a warm place (77&nbsp;\u00b0F/25&nbsp;\u00b0C) for 13 days to convert some of the starch to sugar.  Then the kabocha is transferred to a cool place (50&nbsp;\u00b0F/10&nbsp;\u00b0C) and stored for about a month in order to increase carbohydrate content. In this way the just-harvested, dry, bland-tasting kabocha is transformed into a smooth, sweet kabocha. Fully ripened, succulent kabocha will have reddish-yellow flesh, a hard skin, and a dry, corky stem.  It reaches the peak of ripeness about 1.5\u20133 months after it is harvested.<ref>[http://www.nijiya.com/gochiso/english/2006/files/06english.pdf \"Kabocha (Japanese Pumpkin) A Flavor of the Earth\"] [http://www.nijiya.com/gochiso-magazine#english Gochiso Web Magazine], 2006, p. 8</ref>\n\n==History==\nAll [[squash (plant)|squashes]] were domesticated in [[Mesoamerica]].
