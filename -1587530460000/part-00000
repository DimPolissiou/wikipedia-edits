Retrieved 10 February 2015.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\nFor most of his childhood, Dennis O'Rourke lived in a small country town, where his parents ran a failing business, until he was sent to a Catholic boarding school for his secondary education. In the late 1960s, after two years of fruitless university studies, he went travelling in outback Australia, the Pacific Islands and South East Asia. During this period he worked as a farm hand, salesman, cowboy, a roughneck on oil rigs, and as a maritime seaman. He also taught himself photography and dreamt of becoming a photojournalist. Wanting to make documentary films, he moved to Sydney, where the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] employed him as an assistant gardener. He later became a cinematographer for that organization.\n\nFrom 1974 until 1979 he lived in Papua New Guinea, which was in the process of decolonisation. He worked for the newly independent government, teaching documentary filmmaking skills to Papua New Guineans. His first film, ''[[Yumi Yet - Independence for Papua New Guinea]]'', was completed in 1976, and it was widely acclaimed.\n\nRetrospectives of O'Rourke's work have been held at the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival, the Berlin Film Festival, the Institute of Contemporary Art in London, the Pacific Film Archive in San Francisco; and in other cities, including Freiburg, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Marseille, Melbourne, New Delhi, New York, Singapore, Taipei, and Uppsala.\n\nO'Rourke's film ''Half-Life - A Parable for the Nuclear Age'' was screened at a Leicester Square cinema in London in 1986.\n\nDennis O'Rourke was the father of five children. He died of cancer on June 15, 2013 while producing and directing ''[[I Love a Sunburnt Country...]]'', which is a feature film on the subject of being Australian, as seen through the poetry and poetic imagination of 'ordinary' people.<ref name=\"CameraWork\">[http://www.cameraworklimited.com/dennis-orourke.html CameraWork web site: About Dennis O'Rourke]</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/arts/stories/s3783496.htm ABC Arts] (17 June 2013) ''Vale Dennis O\u2019Rourke''.

Retrieved 10 February 2015.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\nFor most of his childhood, Dennis O'Rourke lived in a small country town, where his parents ran a failing business, until he was sent to a Catholic boarding school for his secondary education. In the late 1960s, after two years of fruitless university studies, he went travelling in outback Australia, the Pacific Islands and South East Asia. During this period he worked as a farm hand, salesman, cowboy, a roughneck on oil rigs, and as a maritime seaman. He also taught himself photography and dreamt of becoming a photojournalist. Wanting to make documentary films, he moved to Sydney where the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] employed him as an assistant gardener. He later became a cinematographer for that organization.\n\nFrom 1974 until 1979 he lived in Papua New Guinea, which was in the process of decolonisation. He worked for the newly independent government, teaching documentary filmmaking skills to Papua New Guineans. His first film, ''[[Yumi Yet - Independence for Papua New Guinea]]'', was completed in 1976, and it was widely acclaimed.\n\nRetrospectives of O'Rourke's work have been held at the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival, the Berlin Film Festival, the Institute of Contemporary Art in London, the Pacific Film Archive in San Francisco; and in other cities, including Freiburg, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Marseille, Melbourne, New Delhi, New York, Singapore, Taipei, and Uppsala.\n\nO'Rourke's film ''Half-Life - A Parable for the Nuclear Age'' was screened at a Leicester Square cinema in London in 1986.\n\nDennis O'Rourke was the father of five children. He died of cancer on June 15, 2013 while producing and directing ''[[I Love a Sunburnt Country...]]'', which is a feature film on the subject of being Australian, as seen through the poetry and poetic imagination of 'ordinary' people.<ref name=\"CameraWork\">[http://www.cameraworklimited.com/dennis-orourke.html CameraWork web site: About Dennis O'Rourke]</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/arts/stories/s3783496.htm ABC Arts] (17 June 2013) ''Vale Dennis O\u2019Rourke''.

His many other awards include the Eastman Kodak award for Cinematography, the Australian Film Institute Byron Kennedy Award, the Director's Prize for Extraordinary Achievement at the Sundance Film Festival, the Grand Prix at the [[Visions du r\u00e9el]] film festival in [[Nyon, Switzerland]], the Jury Prize for Best Film at the Berlin Film Festival, the Grand Premio at the Festival de Popoli in Florence, the Film Critics' Circle of Australia Award for best Documentary, the Australian Film Institute Best Director Award (for ''[[Cunnamulla]]'') and the Australian Centenary Medal \"for services to Australian society and Australian film production\".<ref name=\"CameraWork\"/>\n\n== Court case ==\n\nIn 2007 O'Rourke was awarded damages by the ACT (Australian Capital Territory) Supreme Court for defamation by an Aboriginal rights activist, who had accused O'Rourke of unscrupulous conduct during the filming of ''[[Cunnamulla]]''. O'Rourke also received damages from Nationwide News Pty.

Clancy decides to interview the sim Glasses Man, who he discovers is, in fact, the President in this universe. In front of the White House, a group of anti-marijuana protesters are gathered, seemingly unbothered by the zombies around them. This sparks debate between Clancy and Glasses Man as to whether there is such a thing as a 'good drug' or a 'bad drug'. Over the course of the episode, the two discuss the pros and cons of psychedelics, the dangers of drug usage if not well educated, and whether or not drugs can be beneficial for an individual's personal spiritual growth. They end up helping a pregnant woman give birth before they are all turned into zombies. However, they find the new situation relieving.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\n===Writing and production===\nLater, this rough concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix ordered eight episodes, which premiered on April 20th, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] who were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|website=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show is composed of Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production, they needed to know how much of the episodes will be story, to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell, the parts of the podcast chosen for the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> When Ward and Trussell started working on the scripts, Ward said it would be like taking an [[Indiana Jones]] movie and replacing the dialogue with podcast conversations.The main idea was to turn it into an entertaining animated show. They began to developing it out to following a concept. According Trussell that concept was \"During the apocalypse, people aren\u2019t just going to talk about the apocalypse, being in apocalyptic movies the situation revolves all around the survival.\u2019 Sort of the genesis of the show is what would happen if we took these podcast conversations and made them the dialogue that was happening during the various forms of the apocalypse.\u201d<ref name=\"ComingS\">{{cite web |last1=Hermanns|first1=Grant|title=CS Interview: Duncan Trussell on The Midnight Gospel |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/tv/features/1132053-cs-interview-duncan-trussell-on-the-midnight-gospel |website=[[Coming Soon]]|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe concept was expanded as the writer\u2019s room began exploring various potential apocalypses and finding a way to ensure that the podcast material was able to match up the storylines they built around the episode.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> This was the main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> Trussell described as a \u201claborious process\u201d while also realizing it helped evolve into a series with a story arc.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> They also worked to find a way to embed them in the psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. They thought episodes should have a balance so the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation, people would not pay attention to everything equally. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> According to Trussell, the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]]'s lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others references included the animated films \"[[Watership Down]]\" and \"[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]\" and the animated television series \"[[\u00c6on Flux]]\" and \"[[Liquid Television]]\" and the mystery horror drama television series \"[[Twin Peaks]]\".<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and ''The Midnight Gospel'' would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says, \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. According to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that something was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Themes===\nThroughout the episodes the series deals with different themes that explored through the interviews. During the first season, the guests interviewed covered topics such as [[magic]], [[meditation]], forgiveness, spiritualism, funerary rituals, death positivity, drug use, pain, moksha (transcendence) and existentialism. The animation also acts as a background for stories that expand the interviews.<ref name=\"Mea1\">{{cite web |last1=Salvi|first1=Pooja|title=CS 'The Midnight Gospel' Season 1 is a mesmerizing contemplation on life, love and death that mustn't be missed |url=https://meaww.com/the-midnight-gospel-duncan-trussell-family-hour-podcast-animated-netflix-series-love-death-life-431699 |website=[[Meaww]]|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In the second episode deer-dog hybrids mangling baby clowns to a knight seeking vengeance against an ass-wielding villain. The animation also intentionally complements the dialogue of an interview. During the same episode when the interviewee comments on her lack of fear of death as she's wheeled to the industrial meat grinder run by a bunch of clowns. These animated backstories pulls the viewer into the conversation, making him an important part of the exploration of said subject. <ref name=\"Thr1\">{{cite web |last1=Robinson|first1=Joshua|title=CS Netflix's Mind-Melting Animated Series 'The Midnight Gospel' Is a Soul-Affirming Success|url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/the-midnight-gospel-review-netflix |website=[[Thrillist]]|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 21, 2020}}</ref> \n\nOne constant in several episodes is the life cycle. An analysis of birth and death. The series reinforces how this cycle is continuous, ending process and one cannot escape it. In the last episode of the first season there is a deeper discussion about the miracle of life, the suffering that existence brings to the human life and the detestable pain that death brings with it. The main theme of this episode entitled \"Mouse of Silver\" is to deal with the loss of a loved one. Despite being the main theme in this episode, the theme reappears in several others at different levels. For Trussell the last episode becomes even more personal due to the discourse brought by him deep sorrow he felt after he lost his mother to cancer. <ref name=\"Mea2\">{{cite web |last1=Salvi|first1=Pooja|title=CS 'The Midnight Gospel' Ending Explained: Is Clancy dead?

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\n===Writing and production===\nLater, this rough concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix ordered eight episodes, which premiered on April 20th, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] who were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|website=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show is composed of Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production, they needed to know how much of the episodes will be story, to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell, the parts of the podcast chosen for the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> When Ward and Trussell started working on the scripts, Ward said it would be like taking an [[Indiana Jones]] movie and replacing the dialogue with podcast conversations.The main idea was to turn it into an entertaining animated show. They began to developing it out to following a concept. According Trussell that concept was \"During the apocalypse, people aren\u2019t just going to talk about the apocalypse, being in apocalyptic movies the situation revolves all around the survival.\u2019 Sort of the genesis of the show is what would happen if we took these podcast conversations and made them the dialogue that was happening during the various forms of the apocalypse.\u201d<ref name=\"ComingS\">{{cite web |last1=Hermanns|first1=Grant|title=CS Interview: Duncan Trussell on The Midnight Gospel |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/tv/features/1132053-cs-interview-duncan-trussell-on-the-midnight-gospel |website=[[Coming Soon]]|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe concept was expanded as the writer\u2019s room began exploring various potential apocalypses and finding a way to ensure that the podcast material was able to match up the storylines they built around the episode.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> This was the main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> Trussell described as a \u201claborious process\u201d while also realizing it helped evolve into a series with a story arc.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> They also worked to find a way to embed them in the psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. They thought episodes should have a balance so the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation, people would not pay attention to everything equally. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> According to Trussell, the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]]'s lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others references included the animated films \"[[Watership Down]]\" and \"[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]\" and the animated television series \"[[\u00c6on Flux]]\" and \"[[Liquid Television]]\" and the mystery horror drama television series \"[[Twin Peaks]]\".<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and ''The Midnight Gospel'' would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says, \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. According to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that something was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Themes===\nThroughout the episodes the series deals with different themes that explored through the interviews. During the first season, the guests interviewed covered topics such as [[magic]], [[meditation]], forgiveness, spiritualism, funerary rituals, death positivity, drug use, pain, moksha (transcendence) and existentialism. The animation also acts as a background for stories that expand the interviews.<ref name=\"Mea1\">{{cite web |last1=Salvi|first1=Pooja|title=CS 'The Midnight Gospel' Season 1 is a mesmerizing contemplation on life, love and death that mustn't be missed |url=https://meaww.com/the-midnight-gospel-duncan-trussell-family-hour-podcast-animated-netflix-series-love-death-life-431699 |website=[[Meaww]]|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In the second episode deer-dog hybrids mangling baby clowns to a knight seeking vengeance against an ass-wielding villain. The animation also intentionally complements the dialogue of an interview. During the same episode when the interviewee comments on her lack of fear of death as she's wheeled to the industrial meat grinder run by a bunch of clowns. These animated backstories pulls the viewer into the conversation, making him an important part of the exploration of said subject. <ref name=\"Thr1\">{{cite web |last1=Robinson|first1=Joshua|title=CS Netflix's Mind-Melting Animated Series 'The Midnight Gospel' Is a Soul-Affirming Success|url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/the-midnight-gospel-review-netflix |website=[[Thrillist]]|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 21, 2020}}</ref> \n\nOne constant in several episodes is the life cycle. An analysis of birth and death. The series reinforces how this cycle is continuous, ending process and one cannot escape it. In the last episode of the first season there is a deeper discussion about the miracle of life, the suffering that existence brings to the human life and the detestable pain that death brings with it. The main theme of this episode entitled \"Mouse of Silver\" is to deal with the loss of a loved one. Despite being the main theme in this episode, the theme reappears in several others at different levels. For Trussell the last episode becomes even more personal due to the discourse brought by him deep sorrow he felt after he lost his mother to cancer. <ref name=\"Mea1\">{{cite web |last1=Salvi|first1=Pooja|title=CS 'The Midnight Gospel' Ending Explained: Is Clancy dead?

As part of promoting the show, Netflix's YouTube channel launched a livestream on April 19, 2020 with a countdown to the series' debut on the streaming service. Throughout the livestream, small portions of the episodes were shown as well as a psychedelic animation.<ref name=\"Countdown\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by [[Netflix]], was released on April 20, 2020. According to Trussell, the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20. The date is Trussell's birthday and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-oriented celebrations that take place annually on April 20.<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "name_user": "Marxblom", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Gospel"}

He always had encouragement from them (the younger of his two sisters also wrote poetry) and his mother, proud of her Lowlands [[Scottish people|Scots]] ancestry, often recited poems that she had learned in her 19th-century childhood. Dawe's father's ancestors came from [[Wyke Regis]] in Dorset, England, in the mid-19th century. Dawe attended six schools before leaving [[Northcote High School]] in Melbourne at 16 without completing his [[Matriculation|Leaving Certificate]]. Of the four children in the family, he was the only one to attend secondary school.\n\nAfter leaving school at 16, he worked in a wide range of jobs: as a clerk in various firms as well as a labourer, sales assistant, office boy in an advertising agency and a copy boy at the Melbourne newspapers ''[[The Truth (Melbourne newspaper)|The Truth]]'' and ''[[The Sun News-Pictorial]]''. He also worked as a labourer in the Public Works Department, as a tailer-out in various Melbourne saw-mills and as a farm-hand in the [[Cann River]] valley.\n\nDawe completed his adult matriculation by part-time study in 1953 and enrolled at [[Melbourne University]] on a teaching scholarship in 1954. He left university at the end of 1954 and moved to Sydney, where he worked as a labourer in a glass factory and later in a factory manufacturing batteries. Returning to Melbourne in 1956, he worked as a postman for two years and as a self-employed gardener.\n\nHe joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) in 1959, initially as a trainee telegraphist but remustered as an education assistant. He was posted to Malaysia and returned to Melbourne after six months.\n\n==Teaching==\nLeaving the RAAF in 1968, Dawe began teaching at [[Downlands College]], a Catholic boys college (he became a  Catholic in 1954) in [[Toowoomba, Queensland]]. After teaching English and history at the secondary level for two and a half years, he became a tertiary lecturer in English literature at the [[Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education]] (DDIAE) in Toowoomba.\n\nHe was appointed as a lecturer at DDIAE in 1971, became a senior lecturer in 1980 and an associate professor following the status change to the [[University of Southern Queensland]] (USQ). He was awarded the inaugural DDIAE Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1988. He retired from full-time teaching in 1993 and was appointed as the first honorary professor of USQ in recognition of his contribution to the university.

He always had encouragement from them (the younger of his two sisters also wrote poetry) and his mother, proud of her Lowlands [[Scottish people|Scots]] ancestry, often recited poems that she had learned in her 19th-century childhood. Dawe's father's ancestors came from [[Wyke Regis]] in Dorset, England, in the mid-19th century. Dawe attended six schools before leaving [[Northcote High School]] in Melbourne at 16 without completing his [[Matriculation|Leaving Certificate]]. Of the four children in the family, he was the only one to attend secondary school.\n\nAfter leaving school at 16, he worked in a wide range of jobs: as a clerk in various firms as well as a labourer, sales assistant, office boy in an advertising agency and a copy boy at the Melbourne newspapers ''[[The Truth (Melbourne newspaper)|The Truth]]'' and ''[[The Sun News-Pictorial]]''. He also worked as a labourer in the Public Works Department, as a tailer-out in various Melbourne saw-mills and as a farm-hand in the [[Cann River]] valley.\n\nDawe completed his adult matriculation by part-time study in 1953 and enrolled at [[Melbourne University]] on a teaching scholarship in 1954. He left university at the end of 1954 and moved to Sydney where he worked as a labourer in a glass factory and later in a factory manufacturing batteries. Returning to Melbourne in 1956, he worked as a postman for two years and as a self-employed gardener.\n\nHe joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) in 1959, initially as a trainee telegraphist but remustered as an education assistant. He was posted to Malaysia and returned to Melbourne after six months.\n\n==Teaching==\nLeaving the RAAF in 1968, Dawe began teaching at [[Downlands College]], a Catholic boys college (he became a  Catholic in 1954) in [[Toowoomba, Queensland]]. After teaching English and history at the secondary level for two and a half years, he became a tertiary lecturer in English literature at the [[Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education]] (DDIAE) in Toowoomba.\n\nHe was appointed as a lecturer at DDIAE in 1971, became a senior lecturer in 1980 and an associate professor following the status change to the [[University of Southern Queensland]] (USQ). He was awarded the inaugural DDIAE Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1988. He retired from full-time teaching in 1993 and was appointed as the first honorary professor of USQ in recognition of his contribution to the university. He taught [[University of the Third Age]] classes after his retirement from full-time teaching.\n\nHe held four university degrees (BA, MLitt, MA, PhD), all completed by part-time study.\n\n==Personal life==\nDawe married Gloria Desley Blain on 27 January 1964. Between December 1964 and July 1969, they had four children: Brian, twins Jamie and Katrina, and Melissa.

At the same time Hypermobility Syndrome (also known under the earlier names Joint Hypermobility Syndrome and Benign Joint Hypermobility Syndrome) was redefined as a hypermobility disorder that does not meet the diagnostic criteria for EDS Type 3 (or Marfans, OI, or other collagen disorders) and renamed as Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD).

This same defect also results in weakened bones, which may result in [[osteoporosis]] and [[fractures]].\n* Abnormal joint [[proprioception]] (an impaired ability to locate body parts in space and/or monitor an extended joint)\n\nThese abnormalities cause abnormal joint stress, meaning that the joints can wear out, leading to [[osteoarthritis]].\n\nThe condition tends to run in families, suggesting a genetic basis for at least some forms of hypermobility. The term ''double jointed'' is often used to describe hypermobility; however, the name is a misnomer and should not be taken literally, as hypermobile joints are not doubled/extra in any sense.\n\nMost people have hypermobility with no other symptoms. Approximately 5% of the healthy population have one or more hypermobile joints. However, people with \"joint hypermobility syndrome\" are subject to many difficulties. For example, their joints may be easily injured, be more prone to complete dislocation due to the weakly stabilized joint and they may develop problems from [[muscle fatigue]] (as muscles must work harder to compensate for weakness in the ligaments that support the joints). Hypermobility syndrome can lead to chronic pain or even disability in severe cases. Musical instrumentalists with hypermobile fingers may have difficulties when fingers collapse into the finger locking position. Or, conversely, they may display superior abilities due to their increased range of motion for fingering, such as in playing a violin or cello.\n\nHypermobility may be symptomatic of a serious medical condition, such as [[Stickler syndrome]], [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]],<ref name=\"BJHS\">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jaoa.org/content/106/9/531.full |last1=Simpson |first1=MR |title=Benign joint hypermobility syndrome: evaluation, diagnosis, and management. |journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association |volume=106 |issue=9 |pages=531\u2013536 |date=September 2006 |pmid=17079522 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302094822/http://www.jaoa.org/content/106/9/531.full |archivedate=2013-03-02 }}</ref> [[Marfan syndrome]],<ref name=\"BJHS\"/> [[Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[osteogenesis imperfecta]],<ref name=\"BJHS\"/> [[systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[polio]], [[Down syndrome]],<ref name=\"BJHS\"/> [[morquio syndrome]], [[cleidocranial dysostosis]] or [[myotonia congenita]].\n\nHypermobility has been associated with [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] and [[fibromyalgia]]. Hypermobility causes physical trauma (in the form of joint dislocations, joint [[subluxation]]s, joint instability, [[sprain]]s, etc.). These conditions often, in turn, cause physical and/or emotional trauma and are possible triggers for conditions such as fibromyalgia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/fibromyalgia/guide/fibromyalgia-causes |title=Fibromyalgia: Possible Causes and Risk Factors |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2014-03-06}}</ref>\n\nWomen with hypermobility may experience particular difficulties when pregnant. During pregnancy, the body releases certain [[hormone]]s that alter ligament physiology, easing the stretching needed to accommodate fetal growth as well as the birthing process. The combination of hypermobility and [[Pelvic girdle pain|pregnancy-related pelvic girdle]] during pregnancy can be debilitating. The pregnant woman with hypermobile joints will often be in significant pain as muscles and joints adapt to the pregnancy. Pain often inhibits such women from standing or walking during pregnancy. The pregnant patient may be forced to use a [[bedpan]] and/or a [[wheelchair]] during pregnancy and may experience permanent disability.\n\nSymptoms of hypermobility include a dull but intense pain around the knee and ankle joints and the soles of the feet. The pain and discomfort affecting these body parts can be alleviated by using custom [[orthoses]].\n\n===Syndromes===\n\n[[File:Aa doublejointedfingers.jpg|right|thumb|Hypermobile metacarpo-phalangeal joints]]\n[[File:Hypertension Hypermobilit\u00e4t.jpg|right|thumb|Hyperextension thumb]]\n\nHypermobility syndrome is generally considered to comprise hypermobility together with other symptoms, such as [[myalgia]] and [[arthralgia]]. It is relatively common among children and affects more females than males.\n\nCurrent thinking suggests four causative factors:\n\n* The shape of the ends of the bones\u2014Some joints normally have a large range of movement, such as the shoulder and hip. Both are [[ball-and-socket joint]]s. If a shallow rather than a deep socket is inherited, a relatively large range of movement will be possible. If the socket is particularly shallow, then the joint may dislocate easily.\n* Protein deficiency or hormone problems\u2014Ligaments are made up of several types of protein fibre. These proteins include [[elastin]], which gives elasticity and which may be altered in some people. Female sex hormones alter [[collagen]] [[protein]]s. Women are generally more supple just before a [[menstruation|period]] and even more so in the latter stages of pregnancy, because of a hormone called [[relaxin]] that allows the [[pelvis]] to expand so the head of the baby can pass. Joint mobility differs by race, which may reflect differences in collagen protein structure. People from the Indian sub-continent, for example, often have more supple hands than Caucasians.<ref name=grahamekeer2003>{{cite book|last=Keer|first=Rosemary|title=Hypermobility syndrome : recognition and management for physiotherapists|year=2003|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7506-5390-9|page=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3tLOlyeuI4C&printsec=frontcover|author2=Rodney Grahame|quote=Asian Indians were found by Wordsworth et al. (1987) to be significantly more mobile than English Caucasians.}}</ref>\n* Muscle tone\u2014The tone of muscles is controlled by the nervous system, and influences range of movement. Special techniques can change muscle tone and increase flexibility. [[Yoga]], for example, can help to relax muscles and make the joints more supple. However, please note that Yoga is not recommended by most medical professionals for people with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome, due to the likelihood of damage to the joints. Gymnasts and athletes can sometimes acquire hypermobility in some joints through activity. \n* Proprioception\u2014Compromised ability to detect exact joint/body position with closed eyes, may lead to overstretching and hypermobile joints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arc.org.uk/arthinfo/patpubs/6019/6019.asp |title=Joint hypermobility |work=Arthritis Research UK |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408080835/http://www.arc.org.uk/arthinfo/patpubs/6019/6019.asp |archivedate=2009-04-08 }}</ref><!-- how is this different from generic overstretching? aren't proprioception problems more of a symptom than a cause? -->\n\nHypermobility can also be caused by connective tissue disorders, such as [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]] (EDS) and [[Marfan syndrome]]. Joint hypermobility is a common symptom for both. EDS has numerous sub-types; most include hypermobility in some degree. When hypermobility is the main symptom, then EDS/hypermobility type is likely.

J Rheumatol. 2000;27:1777\u20131779</ref> The Beighton criteria do not replace the Beighton score but instead use the previous score in conjunction with other symptoms and criteria. HMS is diagnosed in the presence of either two major criteria, one major and two minor criteria, or four minor criteria. The criteria are:\n\n==== Major criteria ====\n\n* A Beighton score of 5/9 or more (either current or historic)\n* [[Arthralgia]] for more than three months in four or more joints\nthis has been edited\n==== Minor criteria ====\n\n* A Beighton score of 1, 2 or 3/9 (0, 1, 2 or 3 if aged 50+)\n* Arthralgia (> 3 months) in one to three joints or back pain (> 3 months), [[spondylosis]], [[spondylolysis]]/[[spondylolisthesis]].\n* Dislocation/subluxation in more than one joint, or in one joint on more than one occasion.\n* Soft tissue [[rheumatism]]. > 3 lesions (e.g. [[epicondylitis]], [[tenosynovitis]], [[bursitis]]).\n* [[Marfanoid]] habitus (tall, slim, span/height ratio >1.03, upper: lower segment ratio less than 0.89, arachnodactyly; positive Steinberg finger / Walker wrist signs).\n* Abnormal skin: striae, hyperextensibility, thin skin, papyraceous scarring.\n\n=== Beighton score ===\n\nThe Beighton score is an edited version of the Carter/Wilkinson scoring system which was used for many years as an indicator of widespread hyper-mobility. Medical professionals varied in their interpretations of the results; some accepting as low as 1/9 and some 4/9 as a diagnosis of HMS. Therefore, it was incorporated, with clearer guidelines, into the Brighton Criteria. The Beighton score is measured by adding 1 point for each of the following:\n\n* Placing flat hands on the floor with straight legs\n* Left knee bending backward\n* Right knee bending backward\n* Left elbow bending backward\n* Right elbow bending backward\n* Left thumb touching the forearm\n* Right thumb touching the forearm\n* Left little finger bending backward past 90 degrees\n* Right little finger bending backward past 90 degrees\n\n== Treatments ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\n\n=== Physical therapy ===\n\nIt is important that hypermobile individuals remain fit - even more so than the average individual - to prevent recurrent injuries.  Regular exercise and exercise that is supervised by a physician and physical therapist can reduce symptoms because strong muscles increase dynamic joint stability. Low-impact exercise such as closed chain kinetic exercises are usually recommended as they are less likely to cause injury when compared to high-impact exercise or contact sports.\n\nHeat and cold treatment can help temporarily to relieve the pain of aching joints and muscles but does not address the underlying problems.\n\n=== Medication ===\n\nMedication is not the primary treatment for hypermobility, but can be used as an adjunct treatment for related joint pain. NSAIDs are the primary medications of choice. Narcotics are not recommended for primary or long term treatment and are reserved for short term use after acute injury.\n\n=== Lifestyle modification ===\n\nFor some people with hypermobility, lifestyle changes decrease symptom severity. In general, activity that increases pain is to be avoided. For example:\n\n* Typing can reduce pain from writing.\n* [[Voice control]] [[software]] or a more ergonomic keyboard can reduce pain from typing.\n* Bent knees or sitting can reduce pain from standing.\n* Unwanted symptoms are frequently produced by some forms of yoga and weightlifting. \n* Use of low impact [[elliptical trainer]] machines can replace high-impact running. \n* Pain-free swimming may require a kickboard or extra care to avoid hyperextending elbow and other joints.\n* Weakened ligaments and muscles contribute to poor posture, which may contribute to other medical conditions. \n* [[Isometric exercise]] avoids hyperextension and contributes to strength.\n\n=== Other treatments ===\n\n* Bracing can be helpful for temporarily protecting unstable joints.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nHypermobile joints occur in about 10 to 25% of the population.<ref name=Gar2011/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ligamentous laxity]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|   DiseasesDB     = 31101\n|   ICD10          = {{ICD10|M|35|7|m|30}}\n|   ICD9           = {{ICD9|728.5}} \n|   ICDO           = \n|   OMIM           = 147900\n|   MedlinePlus    = 003295\n|   eMedicineSubj  = \n|   eMedicineTopic = \n|   MeshID         = D007593 \n}}\n{{Commons category|Hypermobility}}\n\n{{Systemic connective tissue disorders}}\n{{Soft tissue disorders}}\n\n[[Category:Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]]\n[[Category:Disorders of fascia]]\n[[Category:Syndromes]]\n[[Category:Arthritis]]\n[[Category:Skeletal disorders]]\n[[Category:Rheumatology]]\n[[Category:Contortion]]\nmy pinky is actually really flexible and i do not know what to do.\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Human disease:  joints that stretch further than normal}}\n\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2009}}\n{{cleanup|date=November 2011}}\n\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Hypermobility\n| synonyms        = hyperlaxity, benign joints hypermobility syndrome (BJHS), hypermobility syndrome (HMS)<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 2204553 | volume=54 | issue=3 | title=Relative efficiency of therapeutic donor insemination using a luteinizing hormone monitor |vauthors=Federman CA, Dumesic DA, Boone WR, Shapiro SS | journal=Fertil Steril | pages=489\u201392| year=1990 | doi=10.1016/S0015-0282(16)53767-4 }}</ref>\n| image           = Hypermobile_fingers_and_thumb.jpg\n| caption         = Hypermobile fingers and thumb\n| pronounce       = \n| field           = [[Rheumatology]]\n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n'''Hypermobility''', also known as '''double-jointedness''', describes [[joint]]s that stretch farther than normal.

This same defect also results in weakened bones, which may result in [[osteoporosis]] and [[fractures]].\n* Abnormal joint [[proprioception]] (an impaired ability to locate body parts in space and/or monitor an extended joint)\n\nThese abnormalities cause abnormal joint stress, meaning that the joints can wear out, leading to [[osteoarthritis]].\n\nThe condition tends to run in families, suggesting a genetic basis for at least some forms of hypermobility. The term ''double jointed'' is often used to describe hypermobility; however, the name is a misnomer and should not be taken literally, as hypermobile joints are not doubled/extra in any sense.\n\nMost people have hypermobility with no other symptoms. Approximately 5% of the healthy population have one or more hypermobile joints. However, people with \"joint hypermobility syndrome\" are subject to many difficulties. For example, their joints may be easily injured, be more prone to complete dislocation due to the weakly stabilized joint and they may develop problems from [[muscle fatigue]] (as muscles must work harder to compensate for weakness in the ligaments that support the joints). Hypermobility syndrome can lead to chronic pain or even disability in severe cases. Musical instrumentalists with hypermobile fingers may have difficulties when fingers collapse into the finger locking position. Or, conversely, they may display superior abilities due to their increased range of motion for fingering, such as in playing a violin or cello.\n\nHypermobility may be symptomatic of a serious medical condition, such as [[Stickler syndrome]], [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]],<ref name=\"BJHS\">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jaoa.org/content/106/9/531.full |last1=Simpson |first1=MR |title=Benign joint hypermobility syndrome: evaluation, diagnosis, and management. |journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association |volume=106 |issue=9 |pages=531\u2013536 |date=September 2006 |pmid=17079522 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302094822/http://www.jaoa.org/content/106/9/531.full |archivedate=2013-03-02 }}</ref> [[Marfan syndrome]],<ref name=\"BJHS\"/> [[Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[osteogenesis imperfecta]],<ref name=\"BJHS\"/> [[systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]], [[polio]], [[Down syndrome]],<ref name=\"BJHS\"/> [[morquio syndrome]], [[cleidocranial dysostosis]] or [[myotonia congenita]].\n\nHypermobility has been associated with [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] and [[fibromyalgia]]. Hypermobility causes physical trauma (in the form of joint dislocations, joint [[subluxation]]s, joint instability, [[sprain]]s, etc.). These conditions often, in turn, cause physical and/or emotional trauma and are possible triggers for conditions such as fibromyalgia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/fibromyalgia/guide/fibromyalgia-causes |title=Fibromyalgia: Possible Causes and Risk Factors |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2008-05-21 |accessdate=2014-03-06}}</ref>\n\nWomen with hypermobility may experience particular difficulties when pregnant. During pregnancy, the body releases certain [[hormone]]s that alter ligament physiology, easing the stretching needed to accommodate fetal growth as well as the birthing process. The combination of hypermobility and [[Pelvic girdle pain|pregnancy-related pelvic girdle]] during pregnancy can be debilitating. The pregnant woman with hypermobile joints will often be in significant pain as muscles and joints adapt to the pregnancy. Pain often inhibits such women from standing or walking during pregnancy. The pregnant patient may be forced to use a [[bedpan]] and/or a [[wheelchair]] during pregnancy and may experience permanent disability.\n\nSymptoms of hypermobility include a dull but intense pain around the knee and ankle joints and the soles of the feet. The pain and discomfort affecting these body parts can be alleviated by using custom [[orthoses]].\n\n===Syndromes===\n\n[[File:Aa doublejointedfingers.jpg|right|thumb|Hypermobile metacarpo-phalangeal joints]]\n[[File:Hypertension Hypermobilit\u00e4t.jpg|right|thumb|Hyperextension thumb]]\n\nHypermobility syndrome is generally considered to comprise hypermobility together with other symptoms, such as [[myalgia]] and [[arthralgia]]. It is relatively common among children and affects more females than males.\n\nCurrent thinking suggests four causative factors:\n\n* The shape of the ends of the bones\u2014Some joints normally have a large range of movement, such as the shoulder and hip. Both are [[ball-and-socket joint]]s. If a shallow rather than a deep socket is inherited, a relatively large range of movement will be possible. If the socket is particularly shallow, then the joint may dislocate easily.\n* Protein deficiency or hormone problems\u2014Ligaments are made up of several types of protein fibre. These proteins include [[elastin]], which gives elasticity and which may be altered in some people. Female sex hormones alter [[collagen]] [[protein]]s. Women are generally more supple just before a [[menstruation|period]] and even more so in the latter stages of pregnancy, because of a hormone called [[relaxin]] that allows the [[pelvis]] to expand so the head of the baby can pass. Joint mobility differs by race, which may reflect differences in collagen protein structure. People from the Indian sub-continent, for example, often have more supple hands than Caucasians.<ref name=grahamekeer2003>{{cite book|last=Keer|first=Rosemary|title=Hypermobility syndrome : recognition and management for physiotherapists|year=2003|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-7506-5390-9|page=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3tLOlyeuI4C&printsec=frontcover|author2=Rodney Grahame|quote=Asian Indians were found by Wordsworth et al.

Special techniques can change muscle tone and increase flexibility. [[Yoga]], for example, can help to relax muscles and make the joints more supple. However, please note that Yoga is not recommended by most medical professionals for people with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome, due to the likelihood of damage to the joints. Gymnasts and athletes can sometimes acquire hypermobility in some joints through activity. \n* Proprioception\u2014Compromised ability to detect exact joint/body position with closed eyes, may lead to overstretching and hypermobile joints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arc.org.uk/arthinfo/patpubs/6019/6019.asp |title=Joint hypermobility |work=Arthritis Research UK |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408080835/http://www.arc.org.uk/arthinfo/patpubs/6019/6019.asp |archivedate=2009-04-08 }}</ref><!-- how is this different from generic overstretching? aren't proprioception problems more of a symptom than a cause? -->\n\nHypermobility can also be caused by connective tissue disorders, such as [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]] (EDS) and [[Marfan syndrome]].

The criteria are:\n\n==== Major criteria ====\n\n* A Beighton score of 5/9 or more (either current or historic)\n* [[Arthralgia]] for more than three months in four or more joints\nthis has been edited\n==== Minor criteria ====\n\n* A Beighton score of 1, 2 or 3/9 (0, 1, 2 or 3 if aged 50+)\n* Arthralgia (> 3 months) in one to three joints or back pain (> 3 months), [[spondylosis]], [[spondylolysis]]/[[spondylolisthesis]].\n* Dislocation/subluxation in more than one joint, or in one joint on more than one occasion.\n* Soft tissue [[rheumatism]]. > 3 lesions (e.g. [[epicondylitis]], [[tenosynovitis]], [[bursitis]]).\n* [[Marfanoid]] habitus (tall, slim, span/height ratio >1.03, upper: lower segment ratio less than 0.89, arachnodactyly; positive Steinberg finger / Walker wrist signs).\n* Abnormal skin: striae, hyperextensibility, thin skin, papyraceous scarring.\n\n=== Beighton score ===\n\nThe Beighton score is an edited version of the Carter/Wilkinson scoring system which was used for many years as an indicator of widespread hyper-mobility. Medical professionals varied in their interpretations of the results; some accepting as low as 1/9 and some 4/9 as a diagnosis of HMS. Therefore, it was incorporated, with clearer guidelines, into the Brighton Criteria. The Beighton score is measured by adding 1 point for each of the following:\n\n* Placing flat hands on the floor with straight legs\n* Left knee bending backward\n* Right knee bending backward\n* Left elbow bending backward\n* Right elbow bending backward\n* Left thumb touching the forearm\n* Right thumb touching the forearm\n* Left little finger bending backward past 90 degrees\n* Right little finger bending backward past 90 degrees\n\n== Treatments ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\n\n=== Physical therapy ===\n\nIt is important that hypermobile individuals remain fit - even more so than the average individual - to prevent recurrent injuries.  Regular exercise and exercise that is supervised by a physician and physical therapist can reduce symptoms because strong muscles increase dynamic joint stability. Low-impact exercise such as closed chain kinetic exercises are usually recommended as they are less likely to cause injury when compared to high-impact exercise or contact sports.\n\nHeat and cold treatment can help temporarily to relieve the pain of aching joints and muscles but does not address the underlying problems.\n\n=== Medication ===\n\nMedication is not the primary treatment for hypermobility, but can be used as an adjunct treatment for related joint pain. NSAIDs are the primary medications of choice. Narcotics are not recommended for primary or long term treatment and are reserved for short term use after acute injury.\n\n=== Lifestyle modification ===\n\nFor some people with hypermobility, lifestyle changes decrease symptom severity. In general, activity that increases pain is to be avoided. For example:\n\n* Typing can reduce pain from writing.\n* [[Voice control]] [[software]] or a more ergonomic keyboard can reduce pain from typing.\n* Bent knees or sitting can reduce pain from standing.\n* Unwanted symptoms are frequently produced by some forms of yoga and weightlifting. \n* Use of low impact [[elliptical trainer]] machines can replace high-impact running. \n* Pain-free swimming may require a kickboard or extra care to avoid hyperextending elbow and other joints.\n* Weakened ligaments and muscles contribute to poor posture, which may contribute to other medical conditions. \n* [[Isometric exercise]] avoids hyperextension and contributes to strength.\n\n=== Other treatments ===\n\n* Bracing can be helpful for temporarily protecting unstable joints.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nHypermobile joints occur in about 10 to 25% of the population.<ref name=Gar2011/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ligamentous laxity]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|   DiseasesDB     = 31101\n|   ICD10          = {{ICD10|M|35|7|m|30}}\n|   ICD9           = {{ICD9|728.5}} \n|   ICDO           = \n|   OMIM           = 147900\n|   MedlinePlus    = 003295\n|   eMedicineSubj  = \n|   eMedicineTopic = \n|   MeshID         = D007593 \n}}\n{{Commons category|Hypermobility}}\n\n{{Systemic connective tissue disorders}}\n{{Soft tissue disorders}}\n\n[[Category:Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]]\n[[Category:Disorders of fascia]]\n[[Category:Syndromes]]\n[[Category:Arthritis]]\n[[Category:Skeletal disorders]]\n[[Category:Rheumatology]]\n[[Category:Contortion]]\n", "name_user": "49.180.131.61", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermobility_(joints)"}

What makes it different to any other opera. Why is this opera the opera it is. The ABC Music Department cast all the operas so I played no part in that. Next was the design. I was allocated a designer. We would work out the costumes and sets and flavour and tone and period. Next is the big job of plotting the opera ie pictures and all the detail. I would leave the office and go home and play the opera for weeks, with the script in front of me. I would work on it plotting bar by bar. Then I passed all that information to the cast. I found most singers very grateful for direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abctvgorehill.com.au/assets/contributions/alan_burke_abc_opera.htm|title=Alan Burke Talks About Early ABC Opera|website=ABC Gore Hill}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe team of ''Lola Montez'' were commissioned to write an original musical for television, ''[[Pardon Miss Westcott]]''.

He directed operas, ballet, musicals, original Australian drama and Australian adaptations of overseas drama.\n\nBurke later described his process for directing operas:\n<blockquote>What I do first is learn the whole opera. I would get the records of the opera and learn every note and all the dialogue. I would play it, and play it etc. After a while images come into the mind \u2013 the way an aria sticks out in an opera and so do certain key moments. Then I work out the crucial scenes. What makes it different to any other opera. Why is this opera the opera it is. The ABC Music Department cast all the operas so I played no part in that. Next was the design. I was allocated a designer. We would work out the costumes and sets and flavour and tone and period. Next is the big job of plotting the opera ie pictures and all the detail. I would leave the office and go home and play the opera for weeks, with the script in front of me. I would work on it plotting bar by bar. Then I passed all that information to the cast. I found most singers very grateful for direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abctvgorehill.com.au/assets/contributions/alan_burke_abc_opera.htm|title=Alan Burke Talks About Early ABC Opera|website=ABC Gore Hill}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe team of ''Lola Montez'' were commissioned to write an original musical for television, ''[[Pardon Miss Westcott]]''.
