Madhavan|Madhavan]]) and Raju Rastogi ([[Sharman Joshi]]) begin their college year in the prestigious Imperial College of [[Engineering]] (ICE) in [[Delhi]]. They are joined by Ranchoddas Chanchad, nicknamed \"Rancho\" ([[Aamir Khan]]), as their roommate. They meet Manmohan a.k.a. \"Millimetre\", an adolescent boy helping the students . He is persuaded by Rancho to sneak into school and get educated. While Farhan chose to pursue engineering over his passion for photography to appease his father, Raju has taken the course in an attempt to end his family's poverty and is always afraid of failing. Rancho, on the other hand, is genuinely passionate in science and engineering. He believes in hands-on learning and tends to give unorthodox answers in class, resulting in him coming into conflict with the professors, particularly the institution's director, Viru Sahastrabuddhe ([[Boman Irani]]), whom the ICE community nicknames \"Virus\". Virus's traditional and strict philosophies on education contrast sharply with Rancho's carefree love of learning. Meanwhile, Chatur ([[Omi Vaidya]]), nicknamed \"Silencer\" (because of his nature of silently farting), is an arrogant student with little knowledge of Hindi due to his Ugandan-Tamilian upbringing, who is obsessed with topping the exams and invariably learns by rote.\n\nSometime later, the trio finds that a student named Joy Lobo, whose interest in machines was as much as Rancho, committed [[suicide]] by [[Suicide by hanging|hanging himself]], which was caused by [[Depression (mood)|depression]] after Virus informs Joy's father that Joy would be unable to graduate that year due to a delay in his submission of an assignment. Joy had taken longer as he wanted to perfect his breakthrough drone design of a quad-copter, and also due to a break on account of his father's brief illness. Rancho criticises Virus' method of teaching and tries to show him how much pressure engineers face when they study, angering him further. Rancho visits his friends' families, and later, the trio then gatecrashes the wedding of Virus' elder daughter, Mona to eat good food. They meet and befriend Pia ([[Kareena Kapoor Khan]]), who turns out to be Virus' younger daughter and a resident student at the city's hospital. Rancho advises Pia not to marry her fianc\u00e9e Suhas Tandon because he's madly obsessed with expensive jewellery, brands, and prices and has no true love for her. Rancho gives Pia a demo on Suhas' attitude by spilling mint sauce on his shoes to annoy him. When Virus spots the trio, he summons Farhan and Raju on the next working day and tells them of the consequences of being friends with Rancho by comparing their families' incomes. He tells them that Rancho comes from a very rich family and does not need to worry about getting good grades and making a career. Affected, Raju moves out and into Chatur's room. During the Teachers Day celebration, Chatur is humiliated when he delivers a Hindi speech modified by Rancho and as a result, he bets Rancho that ten years later, they would see who is more successful. Sometime later, Pia is at the mall with Suhas and spots Rancho with an invention named after Virus; The Virus Inverter. Rancho explains to Pia that he dislikes the way her father teaches his students and that they end up lame like Suhas. Rancho plays a prank on Suhas, pretending that Pia lost her watch, to prove that Suhas shows more value to expensive stuff rather than her. Fed up with Suhas' behaviour, she tells him off. Rancho and Pia save Raju's dying father; Raju reconciles with his friends while Pia falls in love with Rancho.\n\nOne night during their senior year, Farhan and Raju are upset that they are trailing behind in their grades every year and that Rancho is always in the front of every school picture. Farhan exposes Rancho of not telling Pia that he is in love with her and hasn't told her for the past four years. The three friends drunkenly break into the Sahastrabuddhe residence so that Rancho can propose to Pia. As the trio escape, Virus recognises Raju and, on the next day, threatens to expel him unless he writes a letter recommending Rancho for expulsion. Unwilling to betray Rancho or disappoint his family, Raju unsuccessfully attempts suicide and ends up in a [[coma]]. With intensive care and support from his friends, Raju recovers just in time for his first job interview on the campus, which he succeeds in cracking. Meanwhile, Rancho and Pia post Farhan's letter to his favourite Hungarian wildlife photographer Andre Istvan, who offers him a position as an assistant. On Rancho's advice, he communicates his dream to his father, who though reluctant at first, gives his blessings for the sake of his son's happiness.\n\nInfuriated by this and Rancho's influence, Virus sets a difficult final exam paper to fail Raju, wherein Pia tries to help the trio by revealing to them the location of the exam paper in her father's office; unfortunately, Virus finds out and expels them. Pia confronts Virus about her brother who had committed suicide because he couldn't meet Virus' expectation of clearing the engineering exam. That same night, the pregnant Mona goes into labour during a heavy storm that cuts off all traffic and electricity in the city. Rancho and the other students help them by using their engineering knowledge to quickly modify a [[vacuum cleaner]] into a [[ventouse]] and deliver the baby with the help of Pia over a video call. A grateful Virus finally acknowledges Rancho as an extraordinary student and revokes their expulsion. On graduation day, Rancho suddenly disappears shortly after the ceremony ends.\n\nTen years later, in 2009, Farhan is a successful wildlife photographer, while Raju is married and settled with his family in a comfortable lifestyle with a corporate job and Chatur is married and the vice-president of a reputable corporation in the [[United States]] wanting to crack a business deal with a world renowned scientist and businessman with 400 patents to his name, Phunsukh Wangdu for whom he has been asking an appointment for over 1 year  ; none among the three of them have heard from Rancho since graduation. Reuniting at the ICE campus, after Chatur reminds them about the bet,they travel to Shimla, where Rancho was spotted in the background of a snapshot taken by Chatur's secretary, Tracy, who was trying to get an appointment with Wangdu. Chatur then went through the Shimla directory and found the address of Rancho. Upon arrival, they meet a man who turns out to be the real Ranchoddas Chanchad ([[Javed Jaffrey]]) at his father's funeral and the photos of the Rancho they knew replaced with the real one. From him, Farhan and Raju learn that the Rancho they knew was actually \"Chhote\", the smart son of the gardener who was a servant to the Chanchad family who would sneak into school wearing Ranchoddas' old uniform and help Ranchoddas with his schoolwork until he was found out by a teacher who told Ranchoddas' father. Ranchoddas' father then arranged for Chhote to attend ICE in his son's name so that  Ranchoddas could take credit for the degree while  he was in London for 4 years . He also told Chhote to cut off all contact with his ICE friends after graduating but Chhote was sure that two idiots would come looking for him and Ranchoddas won't be able to stop them. Ranchoddas provides Chhote's address in [[Ladakh]], where he is a schoolteacher. On the way, they pass [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]] where against Chatur's wishes, they rescue and prevent Pia from marrying Suhas, who is now a changed man but reverts to his old ways when Raju, disguised as the housekeeping man, puts mint sauce on his wedding jacket, making Raju run away from the wedding in his attire. \n\nUpon arrival in Ladakh, the four head to the village school and witness the young students' inventions that resemble Chhote's college projects. They are reunited with the adult educated Manmohan, now going by the nickname \"Centimetre\" who has now become a helper for Chhote after receiving a letter from him to help him. He tells them that Chhote never forgot about them, stealing and keeping Pia's scooter helmet as a memento, reading Farhan's photography books and Raju's blog. He then tells them where to find Chhote. The four happily reunite with Chhote  to which Pia and Chhote smooch, while Chatur, unaware of Chhote's secret thinking he is Rancho, insults and asks Chhote to sign a contract stating that he is the least successful person; Chhote does so without commenting. As Chatur walks away triumphantly, Chhote reveals that his real name is Phunsukh Wangdu, to his friends' and Pia's surprise and delight. Realizing this, a horrified Chatur accepts his defeat and pleads him to sign his contract while Phunsukh and his friends run away laughing. In the end,  Wangdu tells everyone his theory: \"Follow excellence and success will by itself follow you\".\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Aamir Khan]] as Ranchoddas \"Rancho\" Shamaldas Chanchad / Chhote / Phunsukh Wangdu, one of the titular trio in the engineering college who vanishes after graduation and whom his two friends hunt for 5 years, while telling stories of their time in college together.

In the present story, he is vice-president of an American company (Rockledge Corporation) who discovers his success being overshadowed by Rancho in the end of the film. [[Baradwaj Rangan]] wrote that Chatur being a Tamil from Uganda makes him \"twice removed from the North Indians around him \u2013 a stranger to the nation as well as the national language.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/reviews/article87588.ece|title=3 Idiots|last=Rangan|first=Baradwaj|date=27 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127143622/http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/reviews/article87588.ece|archive-date=27 November 2015|work=[[New Indian Express]]}}</ref>\n* [[Rahul Kumar (actor)|Rahul Kumar]] as young Manmohan (nicknamed Millimetre), and [[Dushyant Wagh]] as adult Manmohan (Centimetre).

But I knew right from the start that I could not make a film completely on the book, as it was very anecdotal and a film needs a plot. So I had decided to rewrite it in a screenplay format. You'll see that the film is very different from the book. After I wrote the script, I called Chetan and narrated it to him. I told him that if he did not like the script, I would stop the project.

I even went to IIT with Abhijat a couple of times. But it was just not possible for me to be involved at every stage of the screenplay writing process since I was in Hong Kong at that time, working full-time and busy writing other books. Moreover, Abhijat is based in USA, Raju was in the US for quite a while working on the screenplay but it was not practical for me to do that [\u2026] The film retains the soul of the book. ''3 Idiots'' is different from the book but at the same time it does borrow many things from the book. The core theme and message of the film is coming from the book itself.

Madhavan|Madhavan]]) and Raju Rastogi ([[Sharman Joshi]]) begin their college year in the prestigious Imperial College of [[Engineering]] (ICE) in [[Delhi]]. They are joined by Ranchoddas Chanchad, nicknamed \"Rancho\" ([[Aamir Khan]]), as their roommate. They meet Manmohan a.k.a. \"Millimetre\", an adolescent boy helping the students . He is persuaded by Rancho to sneak into school and get educated. While Farhan chose to pursue engineering over his passion for photography to appease his father, Raju has taken the course in an attempt to end his family's poverty and is always afraid of failing. Rancho, on the other hand, is genuinely passionate in science and engineering. He believes in hands-on learning and tends to give unorthodox answers in class, resulting in him coming into conflict with the professors, particularly the institution's director, Viru Sahastrabuddhe ([[Boman Irani]]), whom the ICE community nicknames \"Virus\". Virus's traditional and strict philosophies on education contrast sharply with Rancho's carefree love of learning. Meanwhile, Chatur ([[Omi Vaidya]]), nicknamed \"Silencer\" (because of his nature of silently farting), is an arrogant student with little knowledge of Hindi due to his Ugandan-Tamilian upbringing, who is obsessed with topping the exams and invariably learns by rote.\n\nSometime later, the trio finds that a student named Joy Lobo, whose interest in machines was as much as Rancho, committed [[suicide]] by [[Suicide by hanging|hanging himself]], which was caused by [[Depression (mood)|depression]] after Virus informs Joy's father that Joy would be unable to graduate that year due to a delay in his submission of an assignment. Joy had taken longer as he wanted to perfect his breakthrough drone design of a quad-copter, and also due to a break on account of his father's brief illness. Rancho criticises Virus' method of teaching and tries to show him how much pressure engineers face when they study, angering him further. Rancho visits his friends' families, and later, the trio then gatecrashes the wedding of Virus' elder daughter, Mona to eat good food. They meet and befriend Pia ([[Kareena Kapoor Khan]]), who turns out to be Virus' younger daughter and a resident student at the city's hospital. Rancho advises Pia not to marry her fianc\u00e9e Suhas Tandon because he's madly obsessed with expensive jewellery, brands, and prices and has no true love for her. Rancho gives Pia a demo on Suhas' attitude by spilling mint sauce on his shoes to annoy him. When Virus spots the trio, he summons Farhan and Raju on the next working day and tells them of the consequences of being friends with Rancho by comparing their families' incomes. He tells them that Rancho comes from a very rich family and does not need to worry about getting good grades and making a career. Affected, Raju moves out and into Chatur's room. During the Teachers Day celebration, Chatur is humiliated when he delivers a Hindi speech modified by Rancho and as a result, he bets Rancho that ten years later, they would see who is more successful. Sometime later, Pia is at the mall with Suhas and spots Rancho with an invention named after Virus; The Virus Inverter. Rancho explains to Pia that he dislikes the way her father teaches his students and that they end up lame like Suhas. Rancho plays a prank on Suhas, pretending that Pia lost her watch, to prove that Suhas shows more value to expensive stuff rather than her. Fed up with Suhas' behaviour, she tells him off. Rancho and Pia save Raju's dying father; Raju reconciles with his friends while Pia falls in love with Rancho.\n\nOne night during their senior year, Farhan and Raju are upset that they are trailing behind in their grades every year and that Rancho is always in the front of every school picture. Farhan exposes Rancho of not telling Pia that he is in love with her and hasn't told her for the past four years. The three friends drunkenly break into the Sahastrabuddhe residence so that Rancho can propose to Pia. As the trio escape, Virus recognises Raju and, on the next day, threatens to expel him unless he writes a letter recommending Rancho for expulsion. Unwilling to betray Rancho or disappoint his family, Raju unsuccessfully attempts suicide and ends up in a [[coma]]. With intensive care and support from his friends, Raju recovers just in time for his first job interview on the campus, which he succeeds in cracking. Meanwhile, Rancho and Pia post Farhan's letter to his favourite Hungarian wildlife photographer Andre Istvan, who offers him a position as an assistant. On Rancho's advice, he communicates his dream to his father, who though reluctant at first, gives his blessings for the sake of his son's happiness.\n\nInfuriated by this and Rancho's influence, Virus sets a difficult final exam paper to fail Raju, wherein Pia tries to help the trio by revealing to them the location of the exam paper in her father's office; unfortunately, Virus finds out and expels them. Pia confronts Virus about her brother who had committed suicide because he couldn't meet Virus' expectation of clearing the engineering exam. That same night, the pregnant Mona goes into labour during a heavy storm that cuts off all traffic and electricity in the city. Rancho and the other students help them by using their engineering knowledge to quickly modify a [[vacuum cleaner]] into a [[ventouse]] and deliver the baby with the help of Pia over a video call. A grateful Virus finally acknowledges Rancho as an extraordinary student and revokes their expulsion. On graduation day, Rancho suddenly disappears shortly after the ceremony ends.\n\nTen years later, in 2009, Farhan is a successful wildlife photographer, while Raju is married and settled with his family in a comfortable lifestyle with a corporate job and Chatur is married and the vice-president of a reputable corporation in the [[United States]] wanting to crack a business deal with a world renowned scientist and businessman with 400 patents to his name, Phunsukh Wangdu for whom he has been asking an appointment for over 1 year  ; none among the three of them have heard from Rancho since graduation. Reuniting at the ICE campus, after Chatur reminds them about the bet,they travel to Shimla, where Rancho was spotted in the background of a snapshot taken by Chatur's secretary, Tracy, who was trying to get an appointment with Wangdu. Chatur then went through the Shimla directory and found the address of Rancho. Upon arrival, they meet a man who turns out to be the real Ranchoddas Chanchad ([[Javed Jaffrey]]) at his father's funeral and the photos of the Rancho they knew replaced with the real one. From him, Farhan and Raju learn that the Rancho they knew was actually \"Chhote\", the smart son of the gardener who was a servant to the Chanchad family who would sneak into school wearing Ranchoddas' old uniform and help Ranchoddas with his schoolwork until he was found out by a teacher who told Ranchoddas' father. Ranchoddas' father then arranged for Chhote to attend ICE in his son's name so that  Ranchoddas could take credit for the degree while  he was in London for 4 years . He also told Chhote to cut off all contact with his ICE friends after graduating but Chhote was sure that two idiots would come looking for him and Ranchoddas won't be able to stop them. Ranchoddas provides Chhote's address in [[Ladakh]], where he is a schoolteacher. On the way, they pass [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]] where against Chatur's wishes, they rescue and prevent Pia from marrying Suhas, who is now a changed man but reverts to his old ways when Raju, disguised as the housekeeping man, puts mint sauce on his wedding jacket, making Raju run away from the wedding in his attire. \n\nUpon arrival in Ladakh, the four head to the village school and witness the young students' inventions that resemble Chhote's college projects. They are reunited with the adult educated Manmohan, now going by the nickname \"Centimetre\" who has now become a helper for Chhote after receiving a letter from him to help him. He tells them that Chhote never forgot about them, stealing and keeping Pia's scooter helmet as a memento, reading Farhan's photography books and Raju's blog. He then tells them where to find Chhote. The four happily reunite with Chhote  to which Pia and Chhote smooch, while Chatur, unaware of Chhote's secret thinking he is Rancho, insults and asks Chhote to sign a contract stating that he is the least successful person; Chhote does so without commenting. As Chatur walks away triumphantly, Chhote reveals that his real name is Phunsukh Wangdu, to his friends' and Pia's surprise and delight. Realizing this, a horrified Chatur accepts his defeat and pleads him to sign his contract while Phunsukh and his friends run away laughing.

His habit of being gassy due to consumption of pills to enhance his memorisation earns him the nickname Silencer. In the present story, he is vice-president of an American company (Rockledge Corporation) who discovers his success being overshadowed by Rancho in the end of the film. [[Baradwaj Rangan]] wrote that Chatur being a Tamil from Uganda makes him \"twice removed from the North Indians around him \u2013 a stranger to the nation as well as the national language.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/reviews/article87588.ece|title=3 Idiots|last=Rangan|first=Baradwaj|date=27 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151127143622/http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/reviews/article87588.ece|archive-date=27 November 2015|work=[[New Indian Express]]}}</ref>\n* [[Rahul Kumar (actor)|Rahul Kumar]] as young Manmohan (nicknamed Millimetre), and [[Dushyant Wagh]] as adult Manmohan (Centimetre).

But I knew right from the start that I could not make a film completely on the book, as it was very anecdotal and a film needs a plot. So I had decided to rewrite it in a screenplay format. You'll see that the film is very different from the book. After I wrote the script, I called Chetan and narrated it to him. I told him that if he did not like the script, I would stop the project. But he was okay with it.<ref>[http://movies.rediff.com/slide-show/2009/dec/23/slide-show-1-rajkumar-hirani-on-3idiots.htm#contentTop \"Aamir's dedication is mistaken as interference\"], rediff.com, 23 December 2009.</ref>\n\nThe day after the film opened, Chetan also noted:\n:Initially I did sit down with Raju and Abhijat while they were deciding to make a film based on '5 Point Someone'. I even went to IIT with Abhijat a couple of times. But it was just not possible for me to be involved at every stage of the screenplay writing process since I was in Hong Kong at that time, working full-time and busy writing other books. Moreover, Abhijat is based in USA, Raju was in the US for quite a while working on the screenplay but it was not practical for me to do that [\u2026] The film retains the soul of the book. ''3 Idiots'' is different from the book but at the same time it does borrow many things from the book. The core theme and message of the film is coming from the book itself.

This is inherted into [[IEEE]] Std 1003.1-2008 ([[POSIX]]), which is part of the [[Single UNIX Specification]].<ref name=SUS>{{man|1|dd|SUS}}</ref>\n\nThe version of <code>dd</code> bundled in [[GNU]] [[coreutils]] was written by Paul Rubin, David MacKenzie, and Stuart Kemp.<ref name=lin>{{man|1|dd|Linux}}</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\nThe [[command line]] syntax of {{Mono|dd}} differs from many other Unix programs. It uses the syntax {{Mono|''option''{{=}}''value''}} for its [[command-line option]]s rather than the more standard {{Mono|-''option value''}} or {{Mono|--''option''{{=}}''value''}} formats. By default, {{Mono|dd}} reads from [[stdin]] and writes to [[Standard out|stdout]], but these can be changed by using the {{Mono|if}} (input file) and {{Mono|of}} (output file) options.<ref name=SUS/>\n\nCertain features of {{Mono|dd}} will depend on the computer system capabilities, such as {{Mono|dd}}'s ability to implement an option for direct memory access. Sending a [[SIGINFO]] signal (or a USR1 signal on Linux) to a running {{Mono|dd}} process makes it print I/O statistics to [[Standard error stream|standard error]] once and then continue copying. {{Mono|dd}} can read [[standard input]] from the keyboard. When [[end-of-file]] (EOF) is reached, {{Mono|dd}} will exit. Signals and EOF are determined by the software. For example, Unix tools ported to [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] vary as to the EOF: [[Cygwin]] uses {{Key press|Ctrl|D}} (the usual Unix EOF) and [[MKS Toolkit]] uses {{keypress|Ctrl|Z}} (the usual Windows EOF).\n\nThe non-standarized parts of dd invocation vary among implementations. \n\n=== Output messages ===\nOn completion, {{mono|dd}} prints to the [[standard error|stderr]] stream about statistics of the data transfer. The format is standarized in POSIX.<ref name=SUS/>{{rp|at=STDERR}} The manual page for GNU dd does not describe this format, but the BSD manuals do.\n\nEach of the \"Records in\" and \"Records out\" lines shows the number of complete blocks transferred + the number of partial blocks, e.g. because the physical medium ended before a complete block was read, or a physical error prevented reading the complete block.\n\n== Block size ==\nA [[Block (data storage)|block]] is a unit measuring the number of [[byte]]s that are read, written, or converted at one time. Command-line options can specify a different block size for input/reading ({{Mono|ibs}}) compared to output/writing ({{Mono|obs}}), though the block size ({{Mono|bs}}) option will override both {{Mono|ibs}} and {{Mono|obs}}. The default value for both input and output block sizes is 512 bytes (the traditional block size of disks, and POSIX-mandated size of \"a block\"). The {{Mono|count}} option for copying is measured in blocks, as are both the {{Mono|skip}} count for reading and {{Mono|seek}} count for writing. Conversion operations are also affected by the \"conversion block size\" ({{Mono|cbs}}).<ref name=SUS/>{{rp|at=OPERANDS}}\n\nThe value provided for block size options is interpreted as a decimal (base 10) integer number of bytes.  It can also contain suffixes to indicate that the block size is an integer number of larger units than bytes.  POSIX only specifies the suffixes {{Mono|b}} (blocks) for 512 and {{Mono|k}} ([[kibibytes]]) for 1024.<ref name=SUS/>{{rp|at=OPERANDS}}  Implementation differ on the additional suffixes they support: (Free)BSD uses lowercase {{mono|m}} ([[mebibytes]]), {{mono|g}} ([[gigibyte]]s), and so on for [[tebibyte]]s, [[exbibyte]]s, [[pebibyte]]s, [[zebibyte]]s, and [[yobibyte]]s,<ref name=bsd>{{man|1|dd|FreeBSD}}</ref> while GNU uses {{mono|M}} and {{mono|G}} for the same units, with {{mono|kB}}, {{mono|MB}}, and {{mono|GB}} used for their [[International System of Units|SI unit]] counterparts ([[kilobytes]]).<ref name=lin/> For example, for GNU {{mono|dd}}, {{mono|1=bs=16M}} indicates a blocksize of 16 mebibytes (16777216 bytes) and {{mono|1=bs=3kB}} specifies 3000 bytes.\n\nAdditionally, some implementations understand the {{Mono|x}} character as a multiplication operator for both block size and count parameters.  For example, {{Mono|bs{{=}}2x80x18b}} is interpreted as 2 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 512 = {{val|1474560|u=bytes}}, the exact size of a 1440&nbsp;KiB [[floppy disk]]. This is required in POSIX, but GNU does not seem to support it.<ref name=SUS/>{{rp|at=OPERANDS}} As a result, it is more portable to use the [[POSIX shell]] arithmetic syntax of <source lang=bash inline>bs=$((2*80*18))b</source>.\n\nBlock size has an effect on performance of copying {{mono|dd}} commands. Doing many small reads or writes is often slower than doing fewer large ones.  Using large blocks requires more RAM and can complicate error recovery.  When {{Mono|dd}} is used with variable-block-size devices such as tape drives or networks, the block size may determine the tape record size or [[network packet|packet]] size, depending on the [[communications protocol|network protocol]] used.\n\n== Uses ==\nThe {{Mono|dd}} command can be used for a variety of purposes. For plain-copying commands it tends to be slower than the domain-specific alternatives, but it excels at its unique ability to \"overwrite or truncate a file at any point or seek in a file\", a fairly low-level interface to the Unix file API.<ref name=relevant>{{cite web |last1=Gilles |title=cloning - dd vs cat \u2013 is dd still relevant these days? |url=https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/12538 |website=Unix & Linux Stack Exchange |date=2011}}</ref>\n\nThe examples below assume the use of GNU dd, mainly in the block size argument. To make them portable, replace e.g. {{code|1=bs=64M}} with the shell arithmetic expression {{code|1=bs=$((64*1024*1024))}} or {{code|1=bs=$((64 << 20))}} (written equivalently with a [[bit shift]]).\n\n=== Data transfer ===\n{{Mono|dd}} can duplicate data across files, devices, partitions and volumes.

The vanilla {{mono|dd}}, however, is clumsy to use as the user has to read the error messages and manually calculate the regions that can be read. The single block size also limits the granuality of the recovery, as a trade-off has to be made: either use a small one for more data recovered or use a large one for speed.\n\nA C program called {{Mono|dd_rescue}} was written in October 1999. It did away with the conversion functionality of {{mono|dd}}, and supports two block sizes to deal with the dilemma. If a read using a large size fails, it falls back to the smaller size to gather as much as data possible. It can also run backwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/ddrescue/|title=dd_rescue|work=garloff.de}}</ref> In 2003, a {{Mono|dd_rhelp}} script was written to automate the process of using {{mono|dd_rescue}}, keeping track of what areas have been read on its own.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kalysto.org/utilities/dd_rhelp/index.en.html |title= dd_rhelp author's repository |last1= |author= LAB Valentin|date=19 September 2011|quote=Important note : For some times, dd_rhelp was the only tool (AFAIK) that did this type of job, but since a few years, it is not true anymore: Antonio Diaz did write a ideal replacement for my tool: GNU 'ddrescue'.}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, GNU wrote a separate utility, unrelated to {{mono|dd}}, called {{mono|ddrescue}}.

This is inherted into [[IEEE]] Std 1003.1-2008 ([[POSIX]]), which is part of the [[Single UNIX Specification]].<ref name=SUS>{{man|1|dd|SUS}}</ref>\n\nThe version of <code>dd</code> bundled in [[GNU]] [[coreutils]] was written by Paul Rubin, David MacKenzie, and Stuart Kemp.<ref name=lin>{{man|1|dd|Linux}}</ref>\n\n== Usage ==\nThe [[command line]] syntax of {{Mono|dd}} differs from many other Unix programs. It uses the syntax {{Mono|''option''{{=}}''value''}} for its [[command-line option]]s rather than the more standard {{Mono|-''option value''}} or {{Mono|--''option''{{=}}''value''}} formats. By default, {{Mono|dd}} reads from [[stdin]] and writes to [[Standard out|stdout]], but these can be changed by using the {{Mono|if}} (input file) and {{Mono|of}} (output file) options.<ref name=SUS/>\n\nCertain features of {{Mono|dd}} will depend on the computer system capabilities, such as {{Mono|dd}}'s ability to implement an option for direct memory access. Sending a [[SIGINFO]] signal (or a USR1 signal on Linux) to a running {{Mono|dd}} process makes it print I/O statistics to [[Standard error stream|standard error]] once and then continue copying. {{Mono|dd}} can read [[standard input]] from the keyboard. When [[end-of-file]] (EOF) is reached, {{Mono|dd}} will exit. Signals and EOF are determined by the software. For example, Unix tools ported to [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] vary as to the EOF: [[Cygwin]] uses {{Key press|Ctrl|D}} (the usual Unix EOF) and [[MKS Toolkit]] uses {{keypress|Ctrl|Z}} (the usual Windows EOF).\n\nThe non-standarized parts of dd invocation vary among implementations. \n\n=== Output messages ===\nOn completion, {{mono|dd}} prints to the [[standard error|stderr]] stream about statistics of the data transfer. The format is standarized in POSIX.<ref name=SUS/>{{rp|at=STDERR}} The manual page for GNU dd does not describe this format, but the BSD manuals do.\n\nEach of the \"Records in\" and \"Records out\" lines shows the number of complete blocks transferred + the number of partial blocks, e.g. because the physical medium ended before a complete block was read, or a physical error prevented reading the complete block.\n\n== Block size ==\nA [[Block (data storage)|block]] is a unit measuring the number of [[byte]]s that are read, written, or converted at one time. Command-line options can specify a different block size for input/reading ({{Mono|ibs}}) compared to output/writing ({{Mono|obs}}), though the block size ({{Mono|bs}}) option will override both {{Mono|ibs}} and {{Mono|obs}}. The default value for both input and output block sizes is 512 bytes (the traditional block size of disks, and POSIX-mandated size of \"a block\"). The {{Mono|count}} option for copying is measured in blocks, as are both the {{Mono|skip}} count for reading and {{Mono|seek}} count for writing. Conversion operations are also affected by the \"conversion block size\" ({{Mono|cbs}}).<ref name=SUS/>{{rp|at=OPERANDS}}\n\nThe value provided for block size options is interpreted as a decimal (base 10) integer number of bytes.  It can also contain suffixes to indicate that the block size is an integer number of larger units than bytes.  POSIX only specifies the suffixes {{Mono|b}} (blocks) for 512 and {{Mono|k}} ([[kibibytes]]) for 1024.<ref name=SUS/>{{rp|at=OPERANDS}}  Implementation differ on the additional suffixes they support: (Free)BSD uses lowercase {{mono|m}} ([[mebibytes]]), {{mono|g}} ([[gigibyte]]s), and so on for [[tebibyte]]s, [[exbibyte]]s, [[pebibyte]]s, [[zebibyte]]s, and [[yobibyte]]s,<ref name=bsd>{{man|1|dd|FreeBSD}}</ref> while GNU uses {{mono|M}} and {{mono|G}} for the same units, with {{mono|kB}}, {{mono|MB}}, and {{mono|GB}} used for their [[International System of Units|SI unit]] counterparts ([[kilobytes]]).<ref name=lin/> For example, for GNU {{mono|dd}}, {{mono|1=bs=16M}} indicates a blocksize of 16 mebibytes (16777216 bytes) and {{mono|1=bs=3kB}} specifies 3000 bytes.\n\nAdditionally, some implementations understand the {{Mono|x}} character as a multiplication operator for both block size and count parameters.  For example, {{Mono|bs{{=}}2x80x18b}} is interpreted as 2 \u00d7 80 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 512 = {{val|1474560|u=bytes}}, the exact size of a 1440&nbsp;KiB [[floppy disk]]. This is required in POSIX, but GNU does not seem to support it.<ref name=SUS/>{{rp|at=OPERANDS}} As a result, it is more portable to use the [[POSIX shell]] arithmetic syntax of <source lang=bash inline>bs=$((2*80*18))b</source>.\n\nBlock size has an effect on performance of copying {{mono|dd}} commands. Doing many small reads or writes is often slower than doing fewer large ones.  Using large blocks requires more RAM and can complicate error recovery.  When {{Mono|dd}} is used with variable-block-size devices such as tape drives or networks, the block size may determine the tape record size or [[network packet|packet]] size, depending on the [[communications protocol|network protocol]] used.\n\n== Uses ==\nThe {{Mono|dd}} command can be used for a variety of purposes. For plain-copying commands it tends to be slower than the domain-specific alternatives, but it excels at its unique ability to \"overwrite or truncate a file at any point or seek in a file\", a fairly low-level interface to the Unix file API.<ref name=relevant>{{cite web |last1=Gilles |title=cloning - dd vs cat \u2013 is dd still relevant these days? |url=https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/12538 |website=Unix & Linux Stack Exchange |date=2011}}</ref>\n\nThe examples below assume the use of GNU dd, mainly in the block size argument. To make them portable, replace e.g. {{code|1=bs=64M}} with the shell arithmetic expression {{code|1=bs=$((64*1024*1024))}} or {{code|1=bs=$((64 << 20))}} (written equivalently with a [[bit shift]]).\n\n=== Data transfer ===\n{{Mono|dd}} can duplicate data across files, devices, partitions and volumes.  The data may be input or output to and from any of these; but there are important differences concerning the output when going to a partition.  Also, during the transfer, the data can be modified using the {{Mono|conv}} options to suit the medium. (For this purpose, however, {{mono|dd}} is slower than {{mono|cat}}.)<ref name=relevant/>\n\nAn attempt to copy the entire disk using {{Mono|[[cp (Unix)|cp]]}} may omit the final block if it is of an unexpected length{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}; whereas {{Mono|dd}} may succeed.

This can be achived by a \"data transfer\" from the Unix special files.\n\n* To write zeros to a disk, use <code>dd if=[[/dev/zero]] of=[[/dev/sda]] bs=16M</code>.\n* To write random data to a disk, use <code>dd if=[[/dev/urandom]] of=[[/dev/sda]] bs=16M</code>.\n\nWhen compared to the data modification example [[#Data modification|above]], {{Mono|notrunc}} conversion option is not required as it has no effect when the {{mono|dd}}'s output file is a block device.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20526198/why-using-conv-notrunc-when-cloning-a-disk-with-dd |title=linux - Why using conv=notrunc when cloning a disk with dd? |publisher=Stack Overflow |date=2013-12-11 |accessdate=2014-03-24}}</ref>\n\nThe {{Mono|bs{{=}}16M}} option makes dd read and write 16&nbsp;[[mebibytes]] at a time. For modern systems, an even greater block size may be faster. Note that filling the drive with random data may take longer than zeroing the drive, because the random data must be created by the CPU, while creating zeroes is very fast. On modern hard-disk drives, zeroing the drive will render most data it contains permanently irrecoverable.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Craig |last2=Kleiman |first2=Dave |last3=Sundhar R.\u00a0S. |first3=Shyaam |title=Overwriting Hard Drive Data: The Great Wiping Controversy |journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |year=2008 |volume=5352 |series=Information Systems Security |pages=243\u2013257 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-89862-7_21 |accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref>  However, with other kinds of drives such as flash memories, much data may still be recoverable by [[data remanence]].\n\nModern [[hard disk drive]]s contain a [[Secure Erase]] command designed to permanently and securely erase every accessible and inaccessible portion of a drive.  It may also work for some [[solid-state drive]]s (flash drives).  As of 2017, it does not work on [[USB flash drive]]s nor on [[Secure Digital]] flash memories.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  When available, this is both faster than using dd, and more secure.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  On [[Linux]] machines it is accessible via the [[hdparm]] command's {{Mono|--security-erase-enhanced}} option.\n\nThe [[shred (Unix)|shred]] program offers multiple overwrites, as well as more secure deletion of individual files.\n\n=== Data recovery ===\n[[Data recovery]] involves reading from a drive with some parts potentially inaccessible. {{mono|dd}} is a good fit with this job with its flexible skipping ({{mono|seek}}) and other low-level settings. The vanilla {{mono|dd}}, however, is clumsy to use as the user has to read the error messages and manually calculate the regions that can be read. The single block size also limits the granuality of the recovery, as a trade-off has to be made: either use a small one for more data recovered or use a large one for speed.\n\nA C program called {{Mono|dd_rescue}} was written in October 1999. It did away with the conversion functionality of {{mono|dd}}, and supports two block sizes to deal with the dilemma. If a read using a large size fails, it falls back to the smaller size to gather as much as data possible. It can also run backwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/ddrescue/|title=dd_rescue|work=garloff.de}}</ref> In 2003, a {{Mono|dd_rhelp}} script was written to automate the process of using {{mono|dd_rescue}}, keeping track of what areas have been read on its own.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kalysto.org/utilities/dd_rhelp/index.en.html |title= dd_rhelp author's repository |last1= |author= LAB Valentin|date=19 September 2011|quote=Important note : For some times, dd_rhelp was the only tool (AFAIK) that did this type of job, but since a few years, it is not true anymore: Antonio Diaz did write a ideal replacement for my tool: GNU 'ddrescue'.}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, GNU wrote a separate utility, unrelated to {{mono|dd}}, called {{mono|ddrescue}}. The authors of both {{mono|dd_rescue}} and {{mono|dd_rhelp}} considers it superior to their implementation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/ddrescue.html|title=Ddrescue - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)|work=gnu.org}}</ref> To help distinguish the newer GNU program from the older script, alternate names are sometimes used for GNU's {{Mono|ddrescue}}, including {{Mono|addrescue}} (the name on freecode.com and freshmeat.net), {{Mono|gddrescue}} ([[Debian]] package name), and {{Mono|gnu_ddrescue}} ([[openSUSE]] package name).\n\nAnother open-source program called {{Mono|savehd7}} uses a sophisticated algorithm, but it also requires the installation of [[Seed7|its own programming-language interpreter]].\n\n=== Benchmarking drive performance ===\nTo make drive benchmark test and analyze the sequential (and usually single-threaded) system read and write performance for 1024-byte blocks:\n* Write performance: <code>dd if=[[/dev/zero]] bs=1024 count=1000000 of=1GB_file_to_write</code>\n* Read performance: <code>dd if=1GB_file_to_read of=[[/dev/null]] bs=1024</code>\n\n=== Generating a file with random data ===\nTo make a file of 100 random bytes using the kernel random driver:\n{{pre|1=\ndd if=[[/dev/urandom]] of=myrandom bs=100 count=1\n}}\n\n=== Converting a file to upper case ===\nTo convert a file to uppercase:\n{{pre|1=\ndd if=filename of=filename1 conv=ucase,notrunc \n}}\n\n=== Progress indicator ===\nBeing a program mainly designed as a filter, {{Mono|dd}} normally does not provide any progress indication. This can be overcome by sending an {{Mono|USR1}} signal to the running GNU {{Mono|dd}} process, resulting in {{Mono|dd}} printing the current number of transferred blocks.\n\nThe following one-liner results in continuous output of progress every 10&nbsp;seconds until the transfer is finished, when {{Mono|''dd-pid''}} is replaced by the process-id of {{Mono|dd}}: \n{{pre|1=\nwhile kill -USR1 ''dd-pid'' ; do sleep 10 ; done\n}}\n\nNewer versions of GNU {{mono|dd}} support the {{mono|status{{=}}progress}} option, which enables periodic printing of transfer statistics to stderr.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/dd-invocation.html |title=GNU Coreutils: dd invocation |website=The GNU Operating System and the Free Software Movement |access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref>\n\n== Limitations ==\nAs stated in a part of documentation provided by [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]], \"certain disc utilities, such as DD, which depend on low-level disc access may not support 48-bit [[Logical block addressing|LBA]]s until they are updated\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070316080228/http://www.seagate.com/support/kb/disc/tp/137gb.pdf Windows 137GB (128 [[GiB]]) Capacity Barrier - Seagate Technology] (March 2003)</ref>{{citation needed|reason=Current reference|date=January 2014}}  Using ATA hard disk drives over 128&nbsp;[[GiB]] in size requires system support 48-bit LBA; however, in [[Linux]], {{Mono|dd}} uses the kernel to read or write to [[device file]]s instead of accessing hardware directly.{{Efn|This is verifiable with [[strace]].}}  Support for 48-bit LBA has been present since version 2.4.23 of the kernel, released in 2003.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/ChangeLog-2.4.23 | title=ChangeLog-2.4.23 | publisher=www.kernel.org | accessdate=2009-12-07 }}</ref><ref>[http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0311.3/0942.html Linux-2.4.23 released] Linux kernel mailing list, 2003.</ref>\n\n== Forks ==\n=== dcfldd {{anachor|dcfldd fork from 2006}}===\n''{{Mono|dcfldd}}'' is a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of GNU {{Mono|dd}} that is an enhanced version developed by Nick Harbour, who at the time was working for the United States'  [[Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center#Defense Computer Forensics Laboratory (DCFL)|Department of Defense Computer Forensics Lab]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dcfldd.sourceforge.net/ | title = DCFLDD at Source Forge | publisher=Source Forge | accessdate=2013-08-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Jeremy Faircloth, Chris Hurley |title=Penetration Tester's Open Source Toolkit |year=2007 |publisher=Syngress |isbn=9780080556079 |pages=470\u2013472}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Jack Wiles, Anthony Reyes |title=The Best Damn Cybercrime and Digital Forensics Book Period |year=2011 |publisher=Syngress |isbn=9780080556086 |pages=408\u2013411}}</ref> Compared to {{mono|dd}}, {{mono|dcfldd}} allows more than one output file, supports simultaneous multiple checksum calculations, provides a verification mode for file matching, and can display the percentage progress of an operation.
