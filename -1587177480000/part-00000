They are found in shallow temperate and tropical waters of the western [[Pacific Ocean]] and eastern [[Indian Ocean]], chiefly around [[Australia]] and [[Indonesia]], although one species (the [[Japanese wobbegong]], ''Orectolobus japonicus'') occurs as far north as [[Japan]]. The word ''wobbegong'' is believed to come from an [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian Aboriginal language]], meaning \"shaggy beard\", referring to the growths around the mouth of the shark of the western Pacific.\n\n==Description==\n\nWobbegongs are bottom-dwelling sharks, spending much of their time resting on the sea floor.  Most species have a maximum length of {{convert|1.25|m|ft|abbr=on}} or less, but the largest, the [[spotted wobbegong]], ''Orectolobus maculatus'', and [[banded wobbegong]], ''O. halei'', reach about {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length.\n\nWobbegongs are well [[camouflage]]d with a [[Symmetry|symmetrical]] pattern of bold markings which resembles a carpet.  Because of this striking pattern, wobbegongs and their close relatives are often referred to as [[carpet shark]]s. The reason for this is because the strange colours and patterns on their backs resemble carpets.  The camouflage is improved by the presence of small weed-like whisker lobes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/cps/rde/dpi/hs.xsl/28_12484_ENA_HTML.htm|title=Wobbegongs - five species encountered in Queensland|date=2009-03-02|publisher=Queensland Primary Industries and Fisheries|accessdate=2009-06-14|archiveurl=https://archive.is/tAOW|archivedate=1 Aug 2012}}</ref> surrounding the wobbegong's jaw, which help to camouflage it and act as sensory barbs.
