{"title_page": "Metropolitan Opera Live in HD", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|Live from the Metropolitan Opera}}\n\n'''Great Performances at the Met''' (also known as '''The Met: Live in HD''' and '''''Metropolitan Opera Live in HD''''') is a series of live opera performances transmitted in [[high-definition video]] via satellite from the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City to select venues, primarily [[movie theater]]s, in the United States and other parts of the world. The first transmission was of a condensed English-language version of Mozart's ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' on December 30, 2006. Most of the video recordings are later made available for streaming at Met Opera on Demand.\n\n==History==\nTo transmit the series via satellite [[simulcast]] in the US and Canada, the Met has partnered with [[Fathom Events]]. The series is broadcast to [[AMC Theatres]], [[Cinemark]], [[Cineplex Entertainment]], [[Regal Entertainment Group]] (Regal Cinemas, United Artists and Edwards), Goodrich, Kerasotes, Marcus and [[National Amusements]] movie theaters as well as a series of independent venues such as arts centers and college campuses. Its aims include building a larger audience for the Met and garnering excitement for arts at a local level.\n\nThe original idea for presenting operas in this way came from the new incoming general manager of the Met, [[Peter Gelb]] in late 2006. Exhibiting the Met's performances in digital movie theaters is in line with other audience-expanding efforts by the Met such as radio broadcasts on [[Sirius Radio]], [[iPod]] downloads, live streaming video on the Met website, and free opening night screenings in [[Times Square]] and at [[Lincoln Center]]. The Met is also sponsoring free HD broadcasts into selected New York City public schools.<ref>[http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/7484.html \"Metropolitan Opera to Offer Hi-Def Simulcasts in NYC Public Schools\"] Playbill.com, December 12, 2007</ref>\n\nThe simulcasts allow more people to experience the excitement of the Met's high-quality performance offerings. This audience includes current opera fans unable to get to New York City to see the shows in person and potential opera fans looking for an easy, affordable method of checking out a new art form.\n\nTom Galley, chief operations and technology officer of [[National CineMedia]], describes the experience by saying:\n{{quote|This Metropolitan Opera series is a unique opportunity for people to experience world-class opera in their local community, plus the movie theatre environment and affordable ticket price make these events something that the entire family can enjoy.

transmitted in [[high-definition video]] via satellite from the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City to select venues, primarily [[movie theater]]s, in the United States and other parts of the world. The first transmission was of a condensed English-language version of Mozart's ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' on December 30, 2006. Many of the video recordings are later rebroadcast via [[public television]] as part of the ''[[Great Performances]] at the Met'' series, and most are made available for streaming at Met Opera on Demand.\n\n==History==\nTo transmit the series via satellite [[simulcast]] in the US and Canada, the Met has partnered with [[Fathom Events]]. The series is broadcast to [[AMC Theatres]], [[Cinemark]], [[Cineplex Entertainment]], [[Regal Entertainment Group]] (Regal Cinemas, United Artists and Edwards), Goodrich, Kerasotes, Marcus and [[National Amusements]] movie theaters as well as a series of independent venues such as arts centers and college campuses. Its aims include building a larger audience for the Met and garnering excitement for arts at a local level.\n\nThe original idea for presenting operas in this way came from the new incoming general manager of the Met, [[Peter Gelb]] in late 2006. Exhibiting the Met's performances in digital movie theaters is in line with other audience-expanding efforts by the Met such as radio broadcasts on [[Sirius Radio]], [[iPod]] downloads, live streaming video on the Met website, and free opening night screenings in [[Times Square]] and at [[Lincoln Center]]. The Met is also sponsoring free HD broadcasts into selected New York City public schools.<ref>[http://www.playbillarts.com/news/article/7484.html \"Metropolitan Opera to Offer Hi-Def Simulcasts in NYC Public Schools\"] Playbill.com, December 12, 2007</ref>\n\nThe simulcasts allow more people to experience the excitement of the Met's high-quality performance offerings. This audience includes current opera fans unable to get to New York City to see the shows in person and potential opera fans looking for an easy, affordable method of checking out a new art form.\n\nTom Galley, chief operations and technology officer of [[National CineMedia]], describes the experience by saying:\n{{quote|This Metropolitan Opera series is a unique opportunity for people to experience world-class opera in their local community, plus the movie theatre environment and affordable ticket price make these events something that the entire family can enjoy. If you\u2019ve never had the pleasure of attending a live opera performance before, this is the perfect opportunity to see why this magical art form has captured audiences\u2019 imaginations for generations.<ref>[http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/news/press/detail.aspx?id=2719 \u201c'Metropolitan Opera: Live in HD' Now Playing at a Theater Near You,\" press release, November 15, 2006]</ref>}}\n\nIn the US, the series has also been broadcast in both [[high-definition television|high definition]] and regular TV as part of the [[Public Broadcasting Service]]'s ''[[Great Performances]]'' series under the title ''Great Performances at the Met''. In addition, selected performances can now be viewed online.<ref>[http://www.classicaltv.com/the-informer/operas-from-the-met \"Operas from The Met\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003214056/http://www.classicaltv.com/the-informer/operas-from-the-met |date=2009-10-03 }} ClassicalTV</ref>\n\n===International expansion===\nThe first season included seven theatres in Britain, two in Japan and one in Norway.

The county was one of the first counties established out of the vast non-agricultural lands in the more eastern part of the state.  Covington was originally cut out of Lawrence and Wayne Counties, and encompassed what is now Jefferson Davis, Covington, and Jones Counties.\n\nIn 1823, part of Covington County became Bainbridge County, most likely named after William Bainbridge, who became an American naval hero during the War of 1812.  The next year, in 1824, the Mississippi legislature did away with Bainbridge County, giving its lands back to Covington County.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|415|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|414|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|1.1|sqmi}} (0.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=November 3, 2014 |date=August 22, 2012 |title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928074019/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt |archivedate=September 28, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Smith County, Mississippi|Smith County]] (north)\n* [[Jones County, Mississippi|Jones County]] (east)\n* [[Forrest County, Mississippi|Forrest County]] (southeast)\n* [[Lamar County, Mississippi|Lamar County]] (south)\n* [[Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi|Jefferson Davis County]] (west)\n* [[Simpson County, Mississippi|Simpson County]] (northwest)\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Major highways===\n* [[Image:US 49.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 49]]\n* [[Image:US 84.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 84]]\n\nCovington County is crossed both north-to-south and east-to-west by four-laned state highways.

Highway 49 brings to Covington County thousands each day.\n\nHighway 84 cuts across Covington County east to west, and runs through the City of Collins.

The county was one of the first counties established out of the vast non-agricultural lands in the more eastern part of the state.  Covington was originally cut out of Lawrence and Wayne Counties, and encompassed what is now Jefferson Davis, Covington, and Jones Counties.\n\nIn 1823, part of Covington County became Bainbridge County, most likely named after William Bainbridge, who became an American naval hero during the War of 1812.  The next year, in 1824, the Mississippi legislature did away with Bainbridge County, giving its lands back to Covington County.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|415|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|414|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|1.1|sqmi}} (0.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=November 3, 2014 |date=August 22, 2012 |title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928074019/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt |archivedate=September 28, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n*[[Smith County, Mississippi|Smith County]] (north)\n*[[Jones County, Mississippi|Jones County]] (east)\n*[[Forrest County, Mississippi|Forrest County]] (southeast)\n*[[Lamar County, Mississippi|Lamar County]] (south)\n*[[Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi|Jefferson Davis County]] (west)\n*[[Simpson County, Mississippi|Simpson County]] (northwest)\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Major highways===\n\n*[[Image:US 49.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 49]]\n*[[Image:US 84.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 84]]\n\nCovington County is crossed both north-to-south and east-to-west by four-laned state highways.
