Some of them are perennial in nature, others come up on an annual basis while others are biennial in nature. The perennial ones are often very difficult to control. They keep regenerating despite every effort to control them. The annual and biennial ones are easier to deal with. Looking at their visual nature, broadleaf weeds have wide leaves in common. They also have a main center vein that connects to smaller veins which shoot out from a branch. Despite this, they also differ in various  aspects.<ref name=\"MISS\"/>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds develop clusters of blossoms or single flowers as they mature. Such flowers are not aesthetic in nature. They often come in diverse colors such as white, blue, purple, red and so on. Some of them come with  mixed colored flowers while others bear single colored flowers. Despite this, they still appear  unruffled when clustered around a yard or lawn.\n\nThe roots of most broadleaf weeds are fibrous in nature. Some of them spring up with thin roots. Others spring up with a massive taproot while some of them spring up with both types of root systems.  A good number of broadleaf weeds spread through their seeds and rhizomes. Some of them only spread through seeds while others spread through seeds and rhizomes.<ref name=\"UPS\"/>\n\n==Common broadleaf weeds==\nThere are several types of broadleaf weeds  growing in lawns, gardens and yards across the globe.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> Outlined below are the most common broadleaf weeds with their [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial names]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Some of them are perennial in nature, others come up on an annual basis while others are biennial in nature. The perennial ones are often very difficult to control. They keep regenerating despite every effort to control them. The annual and biennial ones are easier to deal with. Looking at their visual nature, broadleaf weeds have wide leaves in common. They also have a main center vein that connects to smaller veins which shoot out from a branch. Despite this, they also differ in various  aspects.<ref name=\"MISS\"/>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds develop clusters of blossoms or single flowers as they mature. Such flowers are not aesthetic in nature. They often come in diverse colors such as white, blue, purple, red and so on. Some of them come with  mixed colored flowers while others bear single colored flowers. Despite this, they still appear  unruffled when clustered around a yard or lawn.\n\nThe roots of most broadleaf weeds are fibrous in nature. Some of them spring up with thin roots. Others spring up with a massive taproot while some of them spring up with both types of root systems.  A good number of broadleaf weeds spread through their seeds and rhizomes. Some of them only spread through seeds while others spread through seeds and rhizomes.<ref name=\"UPS\"/>\n\n==Common broadleaf weeds==\nThere are several types of broadleaf weeds  growing in lawns, gardens and yards across the globe.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> Outlined below are the most common broadleaf weeds with their [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial names]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This should be carried out from time to time in order to check the spread weeds.<ref name=\"SC\"/>\n\n===Lawn mowing===\nIn a thick lawn that is overgrown with broadleaf weeds, the lawn moving method is considered the best approach.  This involves the use of a lawn mower in uprooting the weed.  It can be very tedious especially in situations where there are massive growth of the broadleaf weeds.<ref name=\"TUR\"/>\n\n===Use of chemical herbicides===\nThere are chemical herbicides meant for controlling broadleaf weeds.  The use of such chemicals is often the best option when thinking of clearing the entire yard or lawn of all manner of weeds.  In most cases, the chemical content prevent the weeds from re-surfacing for several months.   The perennial types of broadleaf weeds are often controlled with chemical herbicides although they still find their way back after some months  especially when the cleared lawn or yard is  left unused for months.<ref>{{cite news |title=Broadleaf Weed Problems in Lawns |website=LawnTalk |publisher=University of Illinois Extension |url=https://extension.illinois.edu/lawntalk/weeds/broadleaf_weed_problems_in_lawns.cfm |access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Shading out===\nBroadleaf weeds can be controlled by shading them out.  This involves covering the entire affected area with flat materials such as boards, nylon, plastic spread,  and the like.  When broadleaf weeds are covered that way, they lack access to sunlight and rain that speed up their growth. By so doing, they wither away.<ref name=\"TUR\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Weed]]\n* [[List of common weeds of Queensland]]\n* [[Weed control]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n\n\n[[Category:Garden pests]]\n[[Category:Plants and humans]]\n[[Category:Agricultural pests]]\n", "name_user": "Llunnaz", "label": "safe", "comment": "misprint in the word 'salons' and changed singular to plural in 'seed'", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadleaf_weeds"}

Originally priced about $799, within a year's time the price dropped to $599.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oOQCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18 | title=New York Magazine| date=October 12, 1992}}</ref>\n*The '''CD-i player 300 series''', which includes the 310, 350, 360, and 370 models. The 300 series consists of portable players designed for the professional market and not marketed to home consumers. A popular use was multimedia sales presentations such as those used by pharmaceutical companies to provide product information to physicians, as the devices could be easily transported by sales representatives.<ref name=\"gamefaqs.gamespot.com\"/>\n*The '''CD-i player 400 series''', which includes the 450, 470, 490 models. The 400 models are slimmed-down units aimed at console and educational markets. The CDI 450 player, for instance, is a budget model designed to compete with game consoles. In this version, an infrared remote controller is not standard but optional, as this model is more gaming-oriented. This series was introduced at CES [[Chicago]] in June 1994 and the 450 player retailed at [[Dutch guilders|\u0192]] 799 in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"CDiMagazine\" />\n*The '''CD-i player 500 series''', which includes the 550 model, which was essentially the same as the 450 with an installed digital video cartridge.

The 600 series is designed for professional applications and software development. Units in this line generally include support for [[floppy disk]] drives, [[computer keyboard|keyboards]] and other computer peripherals. Some models can also be connected to an emulator and have software testing and debugging features.\n*The '''CD-I player 700 series''', which consists of the 740 model, the most advanced player and featuring an [[RS-232]] port. It was only released in limited quantities.\n\nThere also exist a number of hard-to-categorize models, such as the FW380i, an integrated mini-stereo and CD-i player; the 21TCDi30, a television with a built-in CD-i device; the CD-i/PC 2.0, a CD-i module with an [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] interface for IBM-compatible 486 PCs.<ref>{{cite book |author=Staff writer |year=1994 |title=21TCDI30 Handbook |publisher=Philips |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref><ref>http://www.icdia.co.uk/brochures/prof_players/cdipc20_a.jpg</ref>\n\n;Gallery\n<gallery>\nPhilips-CDi-220-wController-FL.jpg|The Philips CDI 220\nPhilips-CDi-400-Console-Set.jpg|Magnavox CDI 550 (NTSC) with its paddle controller.

develop TeleCD-i <ref>Physica Verlag, The Information Superhighway and Private Households, p.162-172</ref> (also TeleCD). In this concept, the CD-i player is connected to a network such as [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] or Internet, enabling data-communication and rich media presentation. Dutch grocery chain [[Albert Heijn]] and mail-order company [[:de:Neckermann (Versandhandel)|Neckermann]] were early adopters and introduced award-winning TeleCD-i applications for their home-shopping and home-delivery services. CDMATICS also developed the special Philips TeleCD-i Assistant and a set of software tools to help the worldwide multimedia industry to develop and implement TeleCD-i. TeleCD-i is the world's first networked multimedia application at the time of its introduction. In 1996, Philips acquired source code rights from CDMATICS.\n\n==CD-Online==\n[[File:EmailCDOnline.jpg|thumb|left|E-mail screen of CD-Online UK]]\nInternet services on the CD-i devices were facilitated by the use of an additional hardware modem and \"CD-Online\" disc (renamed Web-i in the US<ref>[https://adage.com/print/78169] {{dead link|date=August 2019}}</ref>), which Philips initially released in Britain in 1995 for $150 US.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1295&dat=19960215&id=4YpOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Ox8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5675,2427974 | title=Philips puts Internet on TV sets | work=[[New Straits Times]] | date=1996-02-15 | accessdate=12 August 2019 | location=[[Malaysia]] | pages=43}}</ref><ref name=\"ParkerStarrett1996\">{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=Dana|last2=Starrett|first2=Bob|title=CD-ROM Professional's CD-recordable Handbook: The Complete Guide to Practical Desktop CD|url=https://archive.org/details/cdromprofessiona00park|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Pemberton Press|isbn=978-0-910965-18-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/cdromprofessiona00park/page/202 202]}}</ref> This service provided the CD-i with full internet access (with a 14.4k [[modem]]<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdinteractive.co.uk/download/mags/0304%2004-1996.pdf|title=Cd-i Magazine|date=August 1996|website=cDinteractive.co.uk|accessdate=12 August 2019}}</ref>), including online shopping, email, and support for networked multiplayer gaming on select CD-i games.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cardilini |first=Les |title=CDI, a low-tech Net option? |date=26 October 1995 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16909256/cdi_a_lowtech_net_option_by_les/ |work=[[The Age]] |location=[[Melbourne]], Australia |volume=142 |issue=43808 |at=Green Guide, p.16}}</ref> The service required a CD-i player with DV cartridge, and an \"Internet Starter Kit\" which initially retailed for  \u00a399.99.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24002397/cdonline_ad_by_philips/ |date=December 2, 1995 |title=Let's Make Things Better |author=Philips |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |volume= |issue= |page=6 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> It was advertized as bringing \"full Internet access to the living room on TV screens\".<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/19961031125504/http://www.cd-online.co.uk/wider.html</ref> Andy Stout, a writer for the official CD-i magazine, explained CD-Online: {{quote|It is very much Internet-lite.

In 1990, [[Peugeot]] used CD-i for its [[point of sale]] application promoting its then-new [[Peugeot 605|605]] automobile, and it was also at the time used by fellow car manufacturer [[Renault]] for staff training programmes, and in Japan by the Ministry of Trade and Industry for an exhibition there. A Philips executive, Gaston Bastiaens, quoted in 1990 \"CD-I will be 'the medium' for entertainment, education and information in the 90's.\".<ref>https://archive.org/details/ACE_Issue_33_1990-06_Future_Publishing_GB/page/n29</ref> Sony introduced its three portable CD-i players in June 1990, pitching them as \"picture books with sound\".<ref name=\"New Computer Express 086\"/>\n\nThe ambitious CD-i format had initially created much interest after its 1986 announcement, both in the west and in Japan, buoyed by the success of the [[CD]]. However, after repeated delays (hardware were first intended to be ready and shipped by Christmas 1987) interest was slowly lost. [[Electronic Arts]] for instance was enthusiastic about CD-i and formed a division for the development of video game titles on the format, but it was eventually halted with the intention of resuming when CD-i players would reach the market. The company eventually never resumed CD-i software development when it was released.<ref>https://archive.org/details/ACEIssue31Apr90/page/n19</ref> The delay also gave more attention to the hyped [[Digital Video Interactive]] (DVI) in 1987, which demonstrated full screen, [[full motion video]] (FMV) using a compression chip on an [[IBM PC/AT]] computer.<ref name=\"filfre.net\">https://www.filfre.net/2016/09/a-slow-motion-revolution/</ref> Amid the attention around its potential rival DVI,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZXvAAAAMAAJ&pg=PR39&lpg=PR39 | title=U-M Computing News| year=1989}}</ref> Philips and Sony decided to find a way to add full screen FMV abilities to the CD-i standard, causing further delay.<ref name=\"filfre.net\"/> Meanwhile, the [[Microsoft]]-backed CD-ROM standard was improving and solved certain video playback issues that were present on the CD-i \u2013 CD-ROM format products were already on the market by 1987.<ref name=\"dvorak.org\"/> At the end, CD-ROM standard benefited from the CD-i and DVI mishaps,<ref name=\"filfre.net\"/> and by the time CD-i players for consumers were released in 1991, CD-ROM had already become known and established.<ref name=\"dvorak.org\"/> [[Ron Gilbert]] commented in early 1990 \"The CD-I specifications look great, but where are the machines? If they'd come out four years ago, they'd have been hot, but now they're behind the times.\"<ref>https://archive.org/details/ACEIssue31Apr90/page/n37</ref> Another reason that led to fading interest pre-launch was the fact CD-i players would not launch with FMV but instead receive it later through a purchasable add-on cartridge (it was originally expected to come built-in) \u2013 as well as the obsolete [[Motorola]] processor, [[OS-9]] software, and a launch price considered high.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://archive.org/stream/DM-V1N02/DM-V1N02_djvu.txt |title = Digital Media: Volume 1, Number 2, July 1991|publisher = Seybold Publications|date = July 1991}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Philips had aggressively promoted their CD-i products in the U.S., by August 1993 ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' reported that \"skepticism persists about its long-term prospects\" compared to other platforms like [[IBM PC compatible]]s, [[Apple Macintosh]], and [[Sega Genesis]].<ref name=\"cgw199308\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=109 | title=Part II of CGW's Computer Game Developers Conference Coverage | work=Computer Gaming World | date=August 1993 | accessdate=July 12, 2014 | pages=38}}</ref> The magazine stated in January 1994 that despite Philips' new emphasis on games \"CD-i is still not the answer for hardcore gamers\", but the console \"may yet surprise us all in the future\".

The magazine noted that while Philips had not yet officially discontinued the CD-i, it was dead for all intents and purposes, citing as evidence the fact that though Philips had a large booth at the 1995 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], there was no CD-i hardware or software on display.

Plans for a second generation CD-i system were certainly present and [[Argonaut Software]] was even designated to design chip sets for the successor to the CD-i. However, the then president [[Cor Boonstra]] saw no interest in the media area for Philips and so Philips sold everything, including the media subsidiary [[Polygram]]. The Dutch half of Philips Media was sold to [[LBi|Softmachine]], which released ''[[The Lost Ride]]'' on the CD-i as the last product for the CD-i.

develop TeleCD-i <ref>Physica Verlag, The Information Superhighway and Private Households, p.162-172</ref> (also TeleCD). In this concept, the CD-i player is connected to a network such as [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] or Internet, enabling data-communication and rich media presentation. Dutch grocery chain [[Albert Heijn]] and mail-order company [[:de:Neckermann (Versandhandel)|Neckermann]] were early adopters and introduced award-winning TeleCD-i applications for their home-shopping and home-delivery services. CDMATICS also developed the special Philips TeleCD-i Assistant and a set of software tools to help the worldwide multimedia industry to develop and implement TeleCD-i. TeleCD-i is the world's first networked multimedia application at the time of its introduction. In 1996, Philips acquired source code rights from CDMATICS.\n\n==CD-Online==\n[[File:EmailCDOnline.jpg|thumb|left|E-mail screen of CD-Online UK]]\nInternet services on the CD-i devices were facilitated by the use of an additional hardware modem and \"CD-Online\" disc (renamed Web-i in the US<ref>[https://adage.com/print/78169] {{dead link|date=August 2019}}</ref>), which Philips initially released in Britain in 1995 for $150 US.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1295&dat=19960215&id=4YpOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Ox8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5675,2427974 | title=Philips puts Internet on TV sets | work=[[New Straits Times]] | date=1996-02-15 | accessdate=12 August 2019 | location=[[Malaysia]] | pages=43}}</ref><ref name=\"ParkerStarrett1996\">{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=Dana|last2=Starrett|first2=Bob|title=CD-ROM Professional's CD-recordable Handbook: The Complete Guide to Practical Desktop CD|url=https://archive.org/details/cdromprofessiona00park|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Pemberton Press|isbn=978-0-910965-18-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/cdromprofessiona00park/page/202 202]}}</ref> This service provided the CD-i with full internet access (with a 14.4k [[modem]]<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cdinteractive.co.uk/download/mags/0304%2004-1996.pdf|title=Cd-i Magazine|date=August 1996|website=cDinteractive.co.uk|accessdate=12 August 2019}}</ref>), including online shopping, email, and support for networked multiplayer gaming on select CD-i games.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cardilini |first=Les |title=CDI, a low-tech Net option? |date=26 October 1995 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/16909256/cdi_a_lowtech_net_option_by_les/ |work=[[The Age]] |location=[[Melbourne]], Australia |volume=142 |issue=43808 |at=Green Guide, p.16}}</ref> The service required a CD-i player with DV cartridge, and an \"Internet Starter Kit\" which initially retailed for  \u00a399.99.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24002397/cdonline_ad_by_philips/ |date=December 2, 1995 |title=Let's Make Things Better |author=Philips |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |volume= |issue= |page=6 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> It was advertized as bringing \"full Internet access to the living room on TV screens\".<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/19961031125504/http://www.cd-online.co.uk/wider.html</ref> Andy Stout, a writer for the official CD-i magazine, explained CD-Online: {{quote|It is very much Internet-lite.

In 1990, [[Peugeot]] used CD-i for its [[point of sale]] application promoting its then-new [[Peugeot 605|605]] automobile, and it was also at the time used by fellow car manufacturer [[Renault]] for staff training programmes, and in Japan by the Ministry of Trade and Industry for an exhibition there. A Philips executive, Gaston Bastiaens, quoted in 1990 \"CD-I will be 'the medium' for entertainment, education and information in the 90's.\".<ref>https://archive.org/details/ACE_Issue_33_1990-06_Future_Publishing_GB/page/n29</ref> Sony introduced its three portable CD-i players in June 1990, pitching them as \"picture books with sound\".<ref name=\"New Computer Express 086\"/>\n\nThe ambitious CD-i format had initially created much interest after its 1986 announcement, both in the west and in Japan, buoyed by the success of the [[CD]]. However, after repeated delays (hardware were first intended to be ready and shipped by Christmas 1987) interest was slowly lost. [[Electronic Arts]] for instance was enthusiastic about CD-i and formed a division for the development of video game titles on the format, but it was eventually halted with the intention of resuming when CD-i players would reach the market.

He graduated from the 36th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy|IJN Academy]] in 1908, with a ranking of 8 out of a class of 191 cadets. As a [[midshipman]], he served in the [[protected cruiser]]s {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Soya||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Niitaka||2}} and the [[armored cruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Nisshin||2}}. After his promotion to [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in 1910, he was assigned to cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Asama||2}}.\n\nAfter attending [[torpedo]] and [[naval artillery]] schools, he was promoted to sub-lieutenant and served in the [[battleship]] {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Aki||2}}, followed by the [[destroyer]] {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Hatsuyuki|1906|2}}. In 1914, he was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and was assigned to the [[battlecruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2}},<!-- See ''Kirishima''\u2032s article for the date of her conversion to a battleship. --> followed by the destroyer {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Sugi|1915|2}}. He was assigned his first command, the destroyer {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Kisaragi|1905|2}}, on 15 December 1917.\n\nNagumo graduated from the [[Naval War College (Japan)|Naval War College]], and was promoted to [[lieutenant commander]] in 1920. His specialty was torpedo and destroyer tactics. From 1920 to 1921, he was captain of the destroyer {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Momi|1919|2}}, but was soon sent to shore duty with various assignments by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff|IJN General Staff]]. He became a [[Commander#Commander as a naval rank|commander]] in 1924. From 1925 to 1926, Nagumo accompanied a Japanese mission to study naval warfare strategy, tactics, and equipment in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].\n\n[[Image:NagumoSaeki1925.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Nagumo (left) with his middle school friend (Ichiro Saeki) in [[Seattle, Washington]] in 1925]]\n\nAfter his return to Japan, Nagumo was appointed captain of the [[river gunboat]] {{ship|Japanese gunboat|Saga||2}} from 20 March 1926 to 15 October 1926, followed by the gunboat {{ship|Japanese gunboat|Uji|1903|2}} from 15 October 1926 to 15 November 1927. He then\nserved as an instructor at the IJN Academy from 1927 to 1929. Nagumo was promoted to [[Captain (naval)|captain]] in November 1929 and assumed command of the [[light cruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Naka||2}} and from 1930 to 1931 was commander of the [[11th Destroyer Division (Japanese)|11th Destroyer Division]]. After serving in administrative positions from 1931 to 1933, he assumed command of the [[heavy cruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Takao|1930|2}} from 1933 to 1934, and the battleship {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamashiro||2}} from 1934 to 1935. He was promoted to [[rear admiral]] on 1 November 1935.\n\nAs a rear admiral, Nagumo commanded the [[8th Cruiser Division (Japanese)|8th Cruiser Division]] to support [[Imperial Japanese Army]] movements in China from the [[Yellow Sea]]. As a leading officer of the militaristic [[Fleet Faction]], he also received a boost in his career from political forces.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1938, he was commandant of the Torpedo School, and from 1938 to 1939, he was commander of the [[3rd Cruiser Division (Japanese)|3rd Cruiser Division]]. Nagumo was promoted to [[Vice Admiral|vice admiral]] on 15 November 1939. From November 1940-April 1941, Nagumo was commandant of the Naval War College.\n\n==World War II==\nOn 10 April 1941, Nagumo was appointed [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[1st Air Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|First Air Fleet]], the IJN\u2032s main [[carrier battle group]], largely due to his seniority. Many contemporaries and historians have doubted his suitability for this command, given his lack of familiarity with [[naval aviation]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\nBy this time, he had visibly aged, physically and mentally. Physically, he suffered from [[arthritis]], perhaps from his younger days as a [[kendo|''kendoka'']].<ref name=DB/> Mentally, he had become a cautious officer who carefully worked over the tactical plans of every operation he was involved in.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nAdmiral [[Nishizo Tsukahara]] had doubts about Nagumo's appointment, and commented, \"Nagumo was an officer of the old school, a specialist of torpedo and surface maneuvers.... He did not have any idea of the capability and potential of naval aviation.\" One son of Nagumo described him as a brooding father, obsessed with and later regretful about pressuring his sons into the IJN. In contrast, Nagumo's junior naval officers thought of him as a father figure.<ref name=DB>[http://ww2db.com/person_bio.php?person_id=N11 World War II Database page on Nagumo].</ref>\n\nDespite his limited experience, he was a strong advocate of combining sea and air power although he was opposed to Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plan to attack the [[United States Navy]] [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor]].<ref>Evans, ''Kaigun'', p. 529</ref> While commanding the First Air Fleet, Nagumo oversaw the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], but he was later criticized for his failure to launch a third attack,<ref>Blair, Clay, Jr. ''Silent Victory'' (Lippincott, 1975); Willmott, H. P. ''Barrier and the Javelin'' (United States Naval Institute Press, 1983); Holmes, W. J. ''Double-Edged Secrets'' (United States Naval Institute Press, 1979).</ref> which might have destroyed the fuel oil storage and repair facilities. This could have rendered the most important U.S. naval base in the Pacific useless, especially as the use of the submarine base and intelligence station at the installation were critical factors in Japan's defeat in the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Blair, ''passim''; Holmes, ''passim''.</ref>\n\nNagumo was surrounded by able lieutenants such as [[Minoru Genda]] and [[Mitsuo Fuchida]]. He also fought well in the early 1942 campaigns, obtaining success as a fleet commander at the [[Bombing of Darwin]] and at the [[Indian Ocean raid]] on the British [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|Eastern Fleet]], the latter of which sank an aircraft carrier, two cruisers, and two destroyers, and caused Admiral Sir [[James Somerville]] to retreat to [[East Africa]].\n\nThe [[Battle of Midway]], in June 1942, brought Nagumo's near-perfect record to an end. The First Air Fleet lost four carriers during the turning point of the Pacific War, and the massive losses of carrier aircraft maintenance personnel would prove detrimental to the performance of the IJN in later engagements. The loss of the four carriers, their aircraft, and their maintenance crews, plus the loss of 120 experienced pilots, resulted in Japan losing the strategic initiative in the Pacific.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Turn of the Tide in the Pacific War|last=Judge|first=Sean M.|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2018|isbn=|editor-last=House|editor-first=Jonathan M.|location=|pages=143}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Nagumo was reassigned as commander-in-chief of the [[Third Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|Third Fleet]] and commanded aircraft carriers in the [[Guadalcanal campaign]], although there his actions were largely indecisive and slowly frittered away much of Japan's maritime strength.\n\n==Final days==\n[[Image:NagumoSaipan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Last picture of Nagumo (center), Saipan, 1944.]]\n\nOn 11 November 1942, Nagumo was reassigned to Japan, where he was given command of the [[Sasebo Naval District]]. He transferred to the [[Kure Naval District]] on 21 June 1943. From October 1943 to February 1944, Nagumo was again commander-in-chief of First Fleet, which was by that time largely involved in only training duties.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nAs Japan's military situation deteriorated, Nagumo was deployed on 4 March 1944 for the short-lived command of the [[List of Air Fleets of the Imperial Japanese Navy#14th Air Fleet|14th Air Fleet]] and the [[Central Pacific Area Fleet]] in the [[Mariana Islands]].\n\nThe Battle of Saipan began on 15 June 1944. The IJN, under Vice Admiral [[Jisabur\u014d Ozawa]], was overwhelmed within days by the [[United States Fifth Fleet|U.S. 5th Fleet]] in the decisive [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], where Japan lost three fleet carriers and about 600 aircraft. Nagumo and his Army peer General [[Yoshitsugu Saito]] then were on their own to keep control of [[Saipan]]. On 6 July, Nagumo killed himself with a pistol to the temple rather than the traditional ''[[seppuku]]''. His remains were recovered by the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] in the cave where he spent his last days as the Japanese commander of Saipan.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/USMC-C-Saipan/index.html Breaching the Marianas: The Battle for Saipan]</ref> He was posthumously promoted to admiral and awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Golden Kite]].\n\nNagumo's grave is located at the \u014cbai-in sub-temple of [[Engaku-ji]] in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kanagawa]], next to the grave of his son, Susumu Nagumo, who was killed in battle aboard the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Kishinami||2}} on 2 December 1944.\n\n==Naval Career==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!IJN Insignia\n!Rank\n!Date\n|-\n|[[File:OR-9_Kaigun_Jun%27i_%28cuff%29.png|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u5c11\u5c09\u5019\u88dc\u751f Kaigun Sh\u014di K\u014dh\u014dsei <br/>([[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy|Midshipman]])\n|21 November 1908\n|-\n||[[File:OF-1a - Kaigun Sh\u014di (cuff).gif|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u5c11\u5c09 ''Kaigun Sh\u014di'' <br/>([[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]])\n|15 January 1910\n|-\n||[[File:OF-1b - Kaigun Ch\u016bi (CUFF).gif|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u4e2d\u5c09 ''Kaigun Ch\u016bi'' <br/>([[Sub-Lieutenant]]/[[Lieutenant Junior Grade]])\n|1 December 1911\n|-\n||[[File:Imperial Japanese Navy Insignia Lieutenant \u6d77\u8ecd\u5927\u5c09.png|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u5927\u5c09 ''Kaigun Daii'' <br/>([[Lieutenant]])\n|1 December 1914\n|-\n||[[File:OF-3 - Kaigun Shosa (cuff).gif|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u5c11\u4f50 ''Kaigun Sh\u014dsa'' <br/>([[Lieutenant-Commander]])\n|1 December 1920\n|-\n||[[File:Imperial Japanese Navy Insignia Commander \u6d77\u8ecd\u4e2d\u4f50.png|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u4e2d\u4f50 ''Kaigun Ch\u016bsa'' <br/>([[Commander]])\n|1 December 1924\n|-\n||[[File:Imperial Japanese Navy Insignia Captain \u6d77\u8ecd\u5927\u4f50.png|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u5927\u4f50 ''Kaigun Daisa'' <br/>([[Captain (naval)|Captain]])\n|30 November 1929\n|-\n||[[File:Imperial Japanese Navy Insignia Rear admiral \u6d77\u8ecd\u5c11\u5c06.png|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u5c11\u5c06 ''Kaigun Sh\u014dsh\u014d'' <br/>([[Rear-Admiral]])\n|15 November 1935\n|-\n||[[File:Imperial Japanese Navy Insignia Vice admiral \u6d77\u8ecd\u4e2d\u5c06.png|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u4e2d\u5c06 ''Kaigun Ch\u016bj\u014d'' <br/>([[Vice-Admiral]])\n|15 November 1939\n|-\n||[[Image:Japan-navy-1931-1944-sleeve 30-1-.gif|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u5927\u5c06 ''Kaigun Taish\u014d'' <br/>([[Admiral]])\n|8 July 1944 (Posthumous)<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n|-\n|}\n\n==In popular culture==\n*In the 1970 film ''[[Tora!

He graduated from the 36th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy|IJN Academy]] in 1908, with a ranking of 8 out of a class of 191 cadets. As a [[midshipman]], he served in the [[protected cruiser]]s {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Soya||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Niitaka||2}} and the [[armored cruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Nisshin||2}}. After his promotion to [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in 1910, he was assigned to cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Asama||2}}.\n\nAfter attending [[torpedo]] and [[naval artillery]] schools, he was promoted to sub-lieutenant and served in the [[battleship]] {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Aki||2}}, followed by the [[destroyer]] {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Hatsuyuki|1906|2}}. In 1914, he was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and was assigned to the [[battlecruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2}},<!-- See ''Kirishima''\u2032s article for the date of her conversion to a battleship. --> followed by the destroyer {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Sugi|1915|2}}. He was assigned his first command, the destroyer {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Kisaragi|1905|2}}, on 15 December 1917.\n\nNagumo graduated from the [[Naval War College (Japan)|Naval War College]], and was promoted to [[lieutenant commander]] in 1920. His specialty was torpedo and destroyer tactics. From 1920 to 1921, he was captain of the destroyer {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Momi|1919|2}}, but was soon sent to shore duty with various assignments by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff|IJN General Staff]]. He became a [[Commander#Commander as a naval rank|commander]] in 1924. From 1925 to 1926, Nagumo accompanied a Japanese mission to study naval warfare strategy, tactics, and equipment in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].\n\n[[Image:NagumoSaeki1925.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Nagumo (left) with his middle school friend (Ichiro Saeki) in [[Seattle, Washington]] in 1925]]\n\nAfter his return to Japan, Nagumo was appointed captain of the [[river gunboat]] {{ship|Japanese gunboat|Saga||2}} from 20 March 1926 to 15 October 1926, followed by the gunboat {{ship|Japanese gunboat|Uji|1903|2}} from 15 October 1926 to 15 November 1927. He then\nserved as an instructor at the IJN Academy from 1927 to 1929. Nagumo was promoted to [[Captain (naval)|captain]] in November 1929 and assumed command of the [[light cruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Naka||2}} and from 1930 to 1931 was commander of the [[11th Destroyer Division (Japanese)|11th Destroyer Division]]. After serving in administrative positions from 1931 to 1933, he assumed command of the [[heavy cruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Takao|1930|2}} from 1933 to 1934, and the battleship {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamashiro||2}} from 1934 to 1935. He was promoted to [[rear admiral]] on 1 November 1935.\n\nAs a rear admiral, Nagumo commanded the [[8th Cruiser Division (Japanese)|8th Cruiser Division]] to support [[Imperial Japanese Army]] movements in China from the [[Yellow Sea]]. As a leading officer of the militaristic [[Fleet Faction]], he also received a boost in his career from political forces.\n\nFrom 1937 to 1938, he was commandant of the Torpedo School, and from 1938 to 1939, he was commander of the [[3rd Cruiser Division (Japanese)|3rd Cruiser Division]]. Nagumo was promoted to [[Vice Admiral|vice admiral]] on 15 November 1939. From November 1940-April 1941, Nagumo was commandant of the Naval War College.\n\n==World War II==\nOn 10 April 1941, Nagumo was appointed [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[1st Air Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|First Air Fleet]], the IJN\u2032s main [[carrier battle group]], largely due to his seniority. Many contemporaries and historians have doubted his suitability for this command, given his lack of familiarity with [[naval aviation]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\nBy this time, he had visibly aged, physically and mentally. Physically, he suffered from [[arthritis]], perhaps from his younger days as a [[kendo|''kendoka'']].<ref name=DB/> Mentally, he had become a cautious officer who carefully worked over the tactical plans of every operation he was involved in.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nAdmiral [[Nishizo Tsukahara]] had doubts about Nagumo's appointment, and commented, \"Nagumo was an officer of the old school, a specialist of torpedo and surface maneuvers.... He did not have any idea of the capability and potential of naval aviation.\" One son of Nagumo described him as a brooding father, obsessed with and later regretful about pressuring his sons into the IJN. In contrast, Nagumo's junior naval officers thought of him as a father figure.<ref name=DB>[http://ww2db.com/person_bio.php?person_id=N11 World War II Database page on Nagumo].</ref>\n\nDespite his limited experience, he was a strong advocate of combining sea and air power although he was opposed to Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plan to attack the [[United States Navy]] [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor]].<ref>Evans, ''Kaigun'', p. 529</ref> While commanding the First Air Fleet, Nagumo oversaw the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], but he was later criticized for his failure to launch a third attack,<ref>Blair, Clay, Jr. ''Silent Victory'' (Lippincott, 1975); Willmott, H. P. ''Barrier and the Javelin'' (United States Naval Institute Press, 1983); Holmes, W. J. ''Double-Edged Secrets'' (United States Naval Institute Press, 1979).</ref> which might have destroyed the fuel oil storage and repair facilities. This could have rendered the most important U.S. naval base in the Pacific useless, especially as the use of the submarine base and intelligence station at the installation were critical factors in Japan's defeat in the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Blair, ''passim''; Holmes, ''passim''.</ref>\n\nNagumo was surrounded by able lieutenants such as [[Minoru Genda]] and [[Mitsuo Fuchida]]. He also fought well in the early 1942 campaigns, obtaining success as a fleet commander at the [[Bombing of Darwin]] and at the [[Indian Ocean raid]] on the British [[Far East Fleet (United Kingdom)|Eastern Fleet]], the latter of which sank an aircraft carrier, two cruisers, and two destroyers, and caused Admiral Sir [[James Somerville]] to retreat to [[East Africa]].\n\nThe [[Battle of Midway]], in June 1942, brought Nagumo's near-perfect record to an end. The First Air Fleet lost four carriers during the turning point of the Pacific War, and the massive losses of carrier aircraft maintenance personnel would prove detrimental to the performance of the IJN in later engagements. The loss of the four carriers, their aircraft, and their maintenance crews, plus the loss of 120 experienced pilots, resulted in Japan losing the strategic initiative in the Pacific.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Turn of the Tide in the Pacific War|last=Judge|first=Sean M.|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2018|isbn=|editor-last=House|editor-first=Jonathan M.|location=|pages=143}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Nagumo was reassigned as commander-in-chief of the [[Third Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|Third Fleet]] and commanded aircraft carriers in the [[Guadalcanal campaign]], although there his actions were largely indecisive and slowly frittered away much of Japan's maritime strength.\n\n==Final days==\n[[Image:NagumoSaipan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Last picture of Nagumo (center), Saipan, 1944.]]\n\nOn 11 November 1942, Nagumo was reassigned to Japan, where he was given command of the [[Sasebo Naval District]]. He transferred to the [[Kure Naval District]] on 21 June 1943. From October 1943 to February 1944, Nagumo was again commander-in-chief of First Fleet, which was by that time largely involved in only training duties.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nAs Japan's military situation deteriorated, Nagumo was deployed on 4 March 1944 for the short-lived command of the [[List of Air Fleets of the Imperial Japanese Navy#14th Air Fleet|14th Air Fleet]] and the [[Central Pacific Area Fleet]] in the [[Mariana Islands]].\n\nThe Battle of Saipan began on 15 June 1944. The IJN, under Vice Admiral [[Jisabur\u014d Ozawa]], was overwhelmed within days by the [[United States Fifth Fleet|U.S. 5th Fleet]] in the decisive [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], where Japan lost three fleet carriers and about 600 aircraft. Nagumo and his Army peer General [[Yoshitsugu Saito]] then were on their own to keep control of [[Saipan]]. On 6 July, Nagumo killed himself with a pistol to the temple rather than the traditional ''[[seppuku]]''. His remains were recovered by the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] in the cave where he spent his last days as the Japanese commander of Saipan.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/USMC-C-Saipan/index.html Breaching the Marianas: The Battle for Saipan]</ref> He was posthumously promoted to admiral and awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Golden Kite]].\n\nNagumo's grave is located at the \u014cbai-in sub-temple of [[Engaku-ji]] in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kanagawa]], next to the grave of his son, Susumu Nagumo, who was killed in battle aboard the destroyer {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Kishinami||2}} on 2 December 1944.\n\n==Naval Career==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!IJN Insignia\n!Rank\n!Date\n|-\n|[[File:OR-9_Kaigun_Jun%27i_%28cuff%29.png|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u5c11\u5c09\u5019\u88dc\u751f Kaigun Sh\u014di K\u014dh\u014dsei <br/>([[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy|Midshipman]])\n|21 November 1908\n|-\n||[[File:OF-1a - Kaigun Sh\u014di (cuff).gif|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u5c11\u5c09 ''Kaigun Sh\u014di'' <br/>([[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]])\n|15 January 1910\n|-\n||[[File:OF-1b - Kaigun Ch\u016bi (CUFF).gif|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u4e2d\u5c09 ''Kaigun Ch\u016bi'' <br/>([[Sub-Lieutenant]]/[[Lieutenant Junior Grade]])\n|1 December 1911\n|-\n||[[File:Imperial Japanese Navy Insignia Lieutenant \u6d77\u8ecd\u5927\u5c09.png|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u5927\u5c09 ''Kaigun Daii'' <br/>([[Lieutenant]])\n|1 December 1914\n|-\n||[[File:OF-3 - Kaigun Shosa (cuff).gif|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u5c11\u4f50 ''Kaigun Sh\u014dsa'' <br/>([[Lieutenant-Commander]])\n|1 December 1920\n|-\n||[[File:Imperial Japanese Navy Insignia Commander \u6d77\u8ecd\u4e2d\u4f50.png|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u4e2d\u4f50 ''Kaigun Ch\u016bsa'' <br/>([[Commander]])\n|1 December 1924\n|-\n||[[File:Imperial Japanese Navy Insignia Captain \u6d77\u8ecd\u5927\u4f50.png|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u5927\u4f50 ''Kaigun Daisa'' <br/>([[Captain (naval)|Captain]])\n|30 November 1929\n|-\n||[[File:Imperial Japanese Navy Insignia Rear admiral \u6d77\u8ecd\u5c11\u5c06.png|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u5c11\u5c06 ''Kaigun Sh\u014dsh\u014d'' <br/>([[Rear-Admiral]])\n|15 November 1935\n|-\n||[[File:Imperial Japanese Navy Insignia Vice admiral \u6d77\u8ecd\u4e2d\u5c06.png|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u4e2d\u5c06 ''Kaigun Ch\u016bj\u014d'' <br/>([[Vice-Admiral]])\n|15 November 1939\n|-\n||[[Image:Japan-navy-1931-1944-sleeve 30-1-.gif|50px]]\n|\u6d77\u8ecd\u5927\u5c06 ''Kaigun Taish\u014d'' <br/>([[Admiral]])\n|8 July 1944 (Posthumous)<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n|-\n|}\n\n==In popular culture==\n*In the 1970 film ''[[Tora!
