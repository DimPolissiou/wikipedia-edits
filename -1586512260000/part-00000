In 1989 he found himself showcasing music from legendary clubs like the [[Hacienda]] on Manchester's [[Piccadilly Radio]] with his \"Isometric Dance Class\" show, which was the first show on legal FM radio in the UK solely dedicated to the new and growing genre of House music. At that time he gave DJs such as [[Justin Robertson]], [[Mike Pickering]] and [[Jon DaSilva]] their first radio exposure. He moved to London in 1990 where he worked as a TV Producer and then as a TV plugger for Phonogram records and was responsible for getting acts from the Talkin Loud stable, founded by Gilles Peterson, onto national TV.\n\nIn 1992, he moved back to Manchester to work for So What Arts, the management company for Simply Red and worked on their hugely successful \"Stars\" tour project.\n\nIn 1994, he then became one of the founder staff members at [[Faze FM]] who operated both [[Kiss 102]] & [[Kiss 105]] as Head of Music and Morning Presenter, programming the music and broadcasting on both stations in both [[Manchester]] and [[Yorkshire]]. Following a take over by [[Chrysalis Radio]] Kiss became Galaxy and he continued to present on the stations, though he moved back to London shortly afterwards to take up the role of Head of Music for MTV UK. He later joined national station long wave radio station [[Atlantic 252]] to present \"BPM\" - a dance music show. Then, in October 1998, he was given the job of repositioning the station to attract 15- to 24-year-olds as programme controller. This gave him the freedom to allow rising DJs [[DJ Lottie]], [[DJ Touche]], [[Eddy Temple Morris]] & [[James Hyman]] their first Radio shows.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.faqs.org/abstracts/Mass-communications/Dunne-joins-Atlantic-252-and-plans-programming-revamp-New-boss-at-Red-Dragon.html | title = Dunne given programme controller role at Atlantic252 | accessdate = 2010-03-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.atlantic252.com/133 | title = Dunne's whereabouts on Atlantic 252 tribute site | accessdate = 2010-03-01 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100402194518/http://www.atlantic252.com/133 | archive-date = 2010-04-02 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the closure of Atlantic by new owners, he joined [[Ministry of Sound]] as Managing Director of their digital radio station and radio syndication business in London.\n\nFollowing that, he worked at Trust the Dj.com and then joined [[Wise Buddah Productions|Wise Buddah]] as a consultant for development in July 2000 and between 2003 and 2010 worked for [[Hed Kandi]].

A remixed version appeared on their debut album ''[[All Over the UK]]'' (1996) and the song was released as a [[12-inch single]] in 1997. The song achieved mainstream popularity in 2003 when it was covered by [[Ultrabeat (English band)|Ultrabeat]] and peaked at No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\n==Force & Styles version==\nThe Force & Styles version was a happy hardcore song which features the vocals of Junior, and was played at Simon and Kerry's wedding \u2013 Simon being an MC who had previously performed with Force & Styles when they DJ'd at various hardcore club nights. The song was produced by Force & Styles and recorded with Junior at their own 'UK Dance Studios', in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex in 1996.\n\nIt first appeared on hardcore compilation albums, and in 1997 it was released on 12\" vinyl on Force & Styles's own record label UK Dance Records, with a b-side \"Apollo 13 <nowiki>[pt II]</nowiki> (The Journey Home)\". The vinyl was also re-released in 2001.\n\nThis hardcore version, although popular among hardcore listeners, never achieved the same mainstream success as the Ultrabeat cover.\n\nAfter the death of Junior on 31 December 2011, an online campaign to get the original, hardcore version into the charts was started called \"Let's get Junior - Pretty Green Eyes (Force & Styles) to #1\".\n\n===Track listing===\n'''12-inch single'''\n# \"Pretty Green Eyes\" (feat.

The group used a recording studio in Liverpool where Mike Di Scala was the engineer, and they first recorded the song there, with Mike singing. During the recording session, they did not have a [[pop filter]] for the microphone, so they had to use a [[sock]] instead.\n\nThe song was signed by [[All Around the World Productions|All Around the World]] because of Di Scala's last single for the label under the Rezonance Q alias. \"Someday\", a cover of the [[Mariah Carey]] song, had achieved a peak of No. 29 in the charts and when Di Scala was discussing its success with All Around the World, he played them Ultrabeat's demo of \"Pretty Green Eyes\". The whistle noise at the start of the song is sampled from House Traffic's 1994 hit \"Every Day of My Life\".\n\n===Chart performance===\nThe song became more popular when it was released on promos and ''[[Clubland (compilation series)|Clubland III]]'' and played more in nightclubs. It was released as a single in August 2003. It entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at No. 2, behind \"[[Breathe (Blu Cantrell song)|Breathe]]\" by [[Blu Cantrell]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/69544/cantrell-cassidy-maintain-uk-chart-control|title=Cantrell, Cassidy Maintain U.K. Chart Control|website=Billboard|accessdate=31 December 2018}}</ref> and stayed in the chart for 15 weeks.<ref name=uk/> This led to Ultrabeat performing on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and a lock-out signing in the [[HMV]] store in Liverpool.\n\n===Music video===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ultrabeat PGE.JPG|thumb|Screenshot of the video.|{{deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 8 September 2009}}]] -->\nThe video was filmed in [[London]] and features three young women who are dancers in a strip club. They are putting on their make-up and outfits, then they dance in the strip club, then the video switches to a nightclub, and back between the two.\n\nUltrabeat also appear in the video. They are sitting down on chairs in the strip club and they are also DJing at the nightclub. The video makes use of green lighting and green clothes, and switches between locations after zooming in on one of the girl's green eyes.\n\nThe original video for \"Pretty Green Eyes\" was actually a casino scene filmed at the Baby Blue Bar on the Albert Dock in Liverpool, but was not used as the actual music video. The scene depicts a gorgeous girl with green eyes gambling on the dice table. The dice dealer, Bill Pettrey, was the Deputy General Manager of Leo Casino, one of Liverpool's top night spots on Queen's Dock.\n\n===Track listing===\n'''CD Single 1'''\n# \"Pretty Green Eyes\"

The song was produced by Force & Styles and recorded with Junior at their own 'UK Dance Studios', in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex in 1996.\n\nIt first appeared on hardcore compilation albums, and in 1997 it was released on 12\" vinyl on Force & Styles's own record label UK Dance Records, with a b-side \"Apollo 13 <nowiki>[pt II]</nowiki> (The Journey Home)\". The vinyl was also re-released in 2001.\n\nThis hardcore version, although popular among hardcore listeners, never achieved the same mainstream success as the Ultrabeat cover.\n\nAfter the death of Junior on 31 December 2011, an online campaign to get the original, hardcore version into the charts was started called \"Let's get Junior - Pretty Green Eyes (Force & Styles) to #1\".\n\n===Track listing===\n'''12-inch single'''\n# \"Pretty Green Eyes\" (feat.

The group used a recording studio in Liverpool where Mike Di Scala was the engineer, and they first recorded the song there, with Mike singing. During the recording session, they did not have a [[pop filter]] for the microphone, so they had to use a [[sock]] instead.\n\nThe song was signed by [[All Around the World Productions|All Around the World]] because of Di Scala's last single for the label under the Rezonance Q alias. \"Someday\", a cover of the [[Mariah Carey]] song, had achieved a peak of No. 29 in the charts and when Di Scala was discussing its success with All Around the World, he played them Ultrabeat's demo of \"Pretty Green Eyes\". The whistle noise at the start of the song is sampled from House Traffic's 1994 hit \"Every Day of My Life\".\n\n===Chart performance===\nThe song became more popular when it was released on promos and ''[[Clubland (compilation series)|Clubland III]]'' and played more in nightclubs. It was released as a single in August 2003. It entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at No. 2, behind \"[[Breathe (Blu Cantrell song)|Breathe]]\" by [[Blu Cantrell]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/69544/cantrell-cassidy-maintain-uk-chart-control|title=Cantrell, Cassidy Maintain U.K. Chart Control|website=Billboard|accessdate=31 December 2018}}</ref> and stayed in the chart for 15 weeks.<ref name=uk/> This led to Ultrabeat performing on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and a lock-out signing in the [[HMV]] store in Liverpool.\n\n===Music video===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ultrabeat PGE.JPG|thumb|Screenshot of the video.|{{deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 8 September 2009}}]] -->\nThe video was filmed in [[London]] and features three young women who are dancers in a strip club. They are putting on their make-up and outfits, then they dance in the strip club, then the video switches to a nightclub, and back between the two.\n\nUltrabeat also appear in the video. They are sitting down on chairs in the strip club and they are also DJ-ing at the nightclub. The video makes use of green lighting and green clothes, and switches between locations after zooming in on one of the girl's green eyes.\n\nThe original video for \"Pretty Green Eyes\" was actually a casino scene filmed at the Baby Blue Bar on the Albert Dock in Liverpool, but was not used as the actual music video. The scene depicts a gorgeous girl with green eyes gambling on the dice table. The dice dealer, Bill Pettrey, was the Deputy General Manager of Leo Casino, one of Liverpool's top night spots on Queen's Dock.\n\n===Track listing===\n'''CD Single 1'''\n# \"Pretty Green Eyes\"

In 1991 they released their debut album ''Words and Music from the Lowlands'' included the singles \"Da Ten Is Mightier Than the Sword\" and \"Mathilda the Wicked Witch\". In 1992 they previewed new tracks on a radio and TV concert with 17-year-old rapper Michael Parkinson of later [[Postmen]]-fame standing in for Ten. The studio-versions of \"Naked\", \"MTV-ling\" and \"Where Have You Been So Long\" appeared in 1993 on ''GOTCHA! GOTCHA! GOTCHA!'', but the rock 'n roll-lifestyle that the band bought into had taken its toll. Singer/guitarist Robadope Ro and rapper 'Rockattack Ten' staged a fistfight during a gig in France and the original line-up fell apart.\nRo lived down his Gotcha!-years by DJing in [[Tokyo]]; upon his return to the Netherlands he joined freakcore-band {{Interlanguage link multi|De Raggende Manne|nl}} as a guitarist and songwriter.\nDrummer Martijn Bosman moved to Beeswamp in an attempt \"to recapture that Gotcha!-vibe\".\nPercussionist Rudi Conga performed with Hipbone Connection.\n\n===1995-1998===\nGotcha! continued in a new line-up including guitarist Koen Fu. In 1995 they released  ''Four: It! The Terra-P-Funk from Beyond Space'' (single: \"Babies\"). Ten left a year later to pursue a solo-career; he recorded two albums, toured with George Clinton and moved to [[London]] (although [[New York City|New York]] was his first option).\n    \nRo, Bosman and Rudi reunited as founding members of Ro & Paradise Funk; they released two albums that found critical acclaim, but no commercial success. The band were forced to split when a hernia kept Ro grounded for a year.\nBosman went on to play with upcoming-stars Ilse de Lange and Kane. Rudi spent the summer of '99 performing as a vocalist with the one-off band Kor en de Amigos at travelling-festival De Parade; he then took over Martijn's column-page in free music-monthly ''FRET''.\n\n===2002-2005===\nThe remaining members staged a comeback-tour and released a live-album as well as a Dutch-language-single (\"Je Moet Je Bek Houwe\", about the fine art of keeping your mouth shut). Nico 'Kid Crash' Noot shared rhymes with junior rappers De Moordgasten, the omitted MC Krimson and [[Osdorp Posse]]-frontman Def P. It became their biggest hit ever.\n\nMeanwhile, departed members Koen Fu and I-Repeat found commercial success with their reggae-band [[Beef (band)|Beef]].\n\nRo, also a drummer and compere for De Grote Prijs, formed breakbeat-soulband OlaBola with Rudi and former RPF-organist Nico Brandsen. Their debut-single \"Problems\" was originally used in a TV commercial and secured them a string of festival dates. By early 2005 Ro fell out with Brandsen and OlaBola broke up. Rudi and Martijn appeared at the [[Pinkpop Festival]] as [[JunkieXL]]'s touring musicians; they backed former [[Republica]]-singer Saffron among others.\n\n===2008-2019===\nIn 2008 music-monthly ''OOR'' published an article on Gotcha! as part of a lookback on Dutch pop-music's 50-year history. A reunion of the original band was considered; Ro agreed but eventually quit the music-scene altogether. Thus members of both line-ups merged into Gotcha All Stars; they toured from 2009 till 2011.\n\nThe same year Rudi and I-Repeat formed {{Interlanguage link multi|Jah6|nl}}, a reggae-band playing converted covers of classic Dutch-language songs by artists as [[Andre Hazes]], [[Willy Alberti]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Corry Konings|nl}} (the latter ending up on a re-recording of her own hit \"Mooi Was Die Tijd\"). They're planning a follow-up to their 2011 debut album. Members of Gotcha! and Jah6 also performed in Rudi's covers band The Graaffy.\n\nIn 2016, Dutch leading music website Maxazine.nl announced E1 Ten was leaving the band. In January 2019, E1 Ten finally released 'The Lovefunk', with the help of amongst others (ex-) Gotcha!-members Martijn Bosman, Michael Parkinson, Janice Williams and Rudi de Graaff.\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

A reunion of the original band was considered; Ro agreed but eventually quit the music-scene altogether. Thus members of both line-ups merged into Gotcha All Stars; they toured from 2009 till 2011.\n\nThe same year Rudi and I-Repeat formed {{Interlanguage link multi|Jah6|nl}}, a reggae-band playing converted covers of classic Dutch-language songs by artists as [[Andre Hazes]], [[Willy Alberti]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Corry Konings|nl}} (the latter ending up on a re-recording of her own hit \"Mooi Was Die Tijd\"). They're planning a follow-up to their 2011 debut album. Members of Gotcha! and Jah6 also performed in Rudi's covers band The Graaffy.\n\nIn 2016, Dutch leading music website Maxazine.nl announced E1 Ten was leaving the band. In January 2019, E1 Ten finally released 'The Lovefunk', with the help of amongst others (ex-) Gotcha!-members Martijn Bosman, Michael Parkinson, Janice Williams and Rudi de Graaff.\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

[[Ball culture]] consists of events that mix performance, dance, lip-syncing, and modeling. Events are divided into various categories, and participants \"walk\" and compete for prizes and trophies. As a countercultural phenomenon, ball culture is rooted in necessity and defiance. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, members of the underground LGBTQ+ community in large cities began to organize masquerade balls known as \"drags\" in defiance of laws which banned individuals from wearing clothes associated with the opposite gender. <ref>Bailey, Marlon. \"Gender/Racial Realness: Theorizing the Gender System in Ballroom Culture\".

Categories are designed to simultaneously epitomize and satirize various [[gender]]s and [[social classes]], while also offering an escape from reality. The culture extends beyond the extravagant events as many participants in ball culture also belong to groups known as \"houses\", a longstanding tradition in LGBT communities, and [[racial minorities]], where chosen families of friends live in households together, forming relationships and community to replace families of origin from which they may be estranged.<ref name=\"HIV/AIDS risk reduction strategies for\">{{cite web|last=Podhurst |first=L. |author2=Credle J. |title=HIV/AIDS risk reduction strategies for Gay youth of color in the \"house\" community.

I once attended as a guest of A'Lelia Walker. It is the ball where men dress as women and women dress as men. During the height of the New Negro era and the tourist invasion of Harlem, it was fashionable for the intelligentsia and social leaders of both Harlem and the downtown area to occupy boxes at this ball and look down from above at the queerly assorted throng on the dancing floor, males in flowing gowns and feathered headdresses and females in tuxedoes and box-back suits.\" \u2014Langston Hughes</blockquote>Although balls now feature mainly Black and Latinx participants, the first known ball at the Hamilton Lodge was integrated. This was uncommon because at the time, racial segregation was nearly universal.<ref>Smith, Barbara. \u201cAfrican American Lesbian and Gay History: An Exploration.\u201d ''The Truth That Never Hurts: Writings on Race, Gender, and Freedom'', Rutgers University Press, 1998.</ref> Although the ball was integrated, racism was still very present, which prevented many Black performers from receiving prizes.

''Bulldaggers, Pansies, and Chocolate Babies\u202f: Performance, Race, and Sexuality in the Harlem Renaissance''. University of Michigan Press, 2010.</ref> This racial discrimination prompted Black and Latinx attendees to form their own balls. In the subsequent decades, drag balls eventually developed the modern, mainstream format we know today.\n\nThe modern ballroom culture has existed for at least five decades. However, it remains largely underground and unknown for this particular community of Black and Latino queer youth.

Those taught became \"drag daughters,\" who in turn mentored others, creating entire \"drag families.\" Drag houses became the first social support groups in the city's gay and lesbian community. House names often came from addresses of the house 'mother', such as Mother Billy Bonhill's Belmont House at 15th and Belmont NW, or associations with the \"mother's\" chosen personality, as Mame Dennis's Beekman Place.<ref name=\"DragDC\">{{cite web |last1=unknown |first1=unknown |title=Drag in DC |url=http://www.rainbowhistory.org/drag.htm |website=rainbowhistory.org |publisher=The Rainbow History Project |accessdate=3 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515145528/http://www.rainbowhistory.org/drag.htm |url-status=dead |archivedate=15 May 2008}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe dance styles which later characterized drag houses had not been developed; competitions between houses involved standard drag performances in which entertainers lip-synced or, rarely, sang. In contrast to the New York houses in Paris Is Burning, some of the Washington, D.C. house mothers were white.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} However, African-American drag queens were a prominent part of the community:\n\n<blockquote>Venues for drag shows and competitions were a constant challenge in the 1960s. The Uptown Lounge sponsored monthly drag contests, an event later duplicated at Johnnie's on Capitol Hill. Chunga's drag shows at the Golden Key Club in North Beach, Maryland were a popular Sunday event. The major hotels' resistance to drag events was not broken until February 1968 when African-American drag impresario Black Pearl staged the gala Black Pearl International Awards at the Washington Hilton. It was the drag event of the year.<ref name=\"DragDC\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe Washington, D.C. ball community consists primarily of African-American and Latino participants, and has adopted many attributes seen in ''Paris Is Burning''. Nineteen-sixties-style drag shows and competitions still exist, with their own audience. Ball patrons will find similar categories (such as \"banjee thug realness\" and \"vogue\") as an audience member.\n\nThe Washington ballroom scene was created in the mid to late 1980s by Icon Lowell Adonis Khanh (Lowell Thomas Hickman, (1986)); Icon Eric Christian-Bazaar; and Icon [[Mother Juan Aviance]], founder and Mother of [[House of Aviance]] (1989\u2014present).

The competitions were divided up into Houses that then competed in different categories, in which one of the categories was voguing. Named after ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine, voguing required dancers to mirror the poses held by models, with emphasis placed on arm and hand movements. Dancers would play out elaborate scenes such as applying makeup or taking phone calls while dancing down the catwalk.<ref name=\"Marra\">{{Cite book|title=Staging desire : Queer readings of American theater history (Triangulations: lesbian/gay/queer theater/drama/performance).|last=Marra|first=K|location=Ann Arbor |publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2002|isbn=|pages=}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=November 2018}} Dancer and choreographer Willi Ninja has been recognized as the \"Grandfather of Vogue\" and the dance, as well as Ninja himself, were covered in the documentary ''Paris is Burning''.<ref name=\"Marra\" />{{Page needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Language===\nThe legacy of ball culture on current drag is extensive. Language that grew out of it is common among the LGBTQ+ community as a whole (such as terms \"reading\" and \"shade\" meaning insults used in battles of wit, and \"spilling tea\" meaning gossiping). The use of categories and judging can be seen on popular reality TV programs such as RuPaul's Drag Race. <ref>The Historic, Mainstream Appropriation of Ballroom Culture. Elyssa Goodman. Them.

Attitudes of defiance and subversion, that were necessary for black, latino, queer, and trans participants, as they navigated discrimination, exclusion, and the ravages of the AIDS epidemic, form an essential part of drag culture as a whole.\n\nBall-culture terms are sometimes used more generally; \"drag mother\" may apply to any drag queen in a mentorship role, and \"drag house\" may refer to a group of drag performers allied personally or professionally. \"Fierce\" and \"fierceness,\" \"work it\" and \"working it,\" \"fabulous\" and \"fabulousness\" are heard in ''Paris Is Burning'' and appeared in the lyrics of \"[[Supermodel (You Better Work)]]\", a 1992 hit by [[drag queen]] [[RuPaul]].

[[Ball culture]] consists of events that mix performance, dance, lip-syncing, and modeling. Events are divided into various categories, and participants \"walk\" and compete for prizes and trophies. As a countercultural phenomenon, ball culture is rooted in necessity and defiance. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, members of the underground LGBTQ+ community in large cities began to organize masquerade balls known as \"drags\" in defiance of laws which banned individuals from wearing clothes associated with the opposite gender. <ref>Bailey, Marlon. \"Gender/Racial Realness: Theorizing the Gender System in Ballroom Culture\".

The culture extends beyond the extravagant events as many participants in ball culture also belong to groups known as \"houses\", a longstanding tradition in LGBT communities, and [[racial minorities]], where chosen families of friends live in households together, forming relationships and community to replace families of origin from which they may be estranged.<ref name=\"HIV/AIDS risk reduction strategies for\">{{cite web|last=Podhurst |first=L. |author2=Credle J. |title=HIV/AIDS risk reduction strategies for Gay youth of color in the \"house\" community.

I once attended as a guest of A'Lelia Walker. It is the ball where men dress as women and women dress as men. During the height of the New Negro era and the tourist invasion of Harlem, it was fashionable for the intelligentsia and social leaders of both Harlem and the downtown area to occupy boxes at this ball and look down from above at the queerly assorted throng on the dancing floor, males in flowing gowns and feathered headdresses and females in tuxedoes and box-back suits.\" \u2014Langston Hughes</blockquote>Although balls now feature mainly Black and Latinx participants, the first known ball at the Hamilton Lodge was integrated. This was uncommon because at the time, racial segregation was nearly universal.<ref>Smith, Barbara. \u201cAfrican American Lesbian and Gay History: An Exploration.\u201d ''The Truth That Never Hurts: Writings on Race, Gender, and Freedom'', Rutgers University Press, 1998.</ref> Although the ball was integrated, racism was still very present, which prevented many Black performers from receiving prizes. There were no Black judges and many believe that the balls were rigged so that only Whites could win.<ref>Wilson, James F. ''Bulldaggers, Pansies, and Chocolate Babies\u202f: Performance, Race, and Sexuality in the Harlem Renaissance''. University of Michigan Press, 2010.</ref> This racial discrimination prompted Black and Latinx attendees to form their own balls. In the subsequent decades, drag balls eventually developed the modern, mainstream format we know today.\n\nThe modern ballroom culture has existed for at least five decades. However, it remains largely underground and unknown for this particular community of Black and Latino queer youth.

Those taught became \"drag daughters,\" who in turn mentored others, creating entire \"drag families.\" Drag houses became the first social support groups in the city's gay and lesbian community. House names often came from addresses of the house 'mother', such as Mother Billy Bonhill's Belmont House at 15th and Belmont NW, or associations with the \"mother's\" chosen personality, as Mame Dennis's Beekman Place.<ref name=\"DragDC\">{{cite web |last1=unknown |first1=unknown |title=Drag in DC |url=http://www.rainbowhistory.org/drag.htm |website=rainbowhistory.org |publisher=The Rainbow History Project |accessdate=3 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515145528/http://www.rainbowhistory.org/drag.htm |url-status=dead |archivedate=15 May 2008}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe dance styles which later characterized drag houses had not been developed; competitions between houses involved standard drag performances in which entertainers lip-synced or, rarely, sang. In contrast to the New York houses in Paris Is Burning, some of the Washington, D.C. house mothers were white.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} However, African-American drag queens were a prominent part of the community:\n\n<blockquote>Venues for drag shows and competitions were a constant challenge in the 1960s. The Uptown Lounge sponsored monthly drag contests, an event later duplicated at Johnnie's on Capitol Hill. Chunga's drag shows at the Golden Key Club in North Beach, Maryland were a popular Sunday event. The major hotels' resistance to drag events was not broken until February 1968 when African-American drag impresario Black Pearl staged the gala Black Pearl International Awards at the Washington Hilton. It was the drag event of the year.<ref name=\"DragDC\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe Washington, D.C. ball community consists primarily of African-American and Latino participants, and has adopted many attributes seen in ''Paris Is Burning''. Nineteen-sixties-style drag shows and competitions still exist, with their own audience. Ball patrons will find similar categories (such as \"banjee thug realness\" and \"vogue\") as an audience member.\n\nThe Washington ballroom scene was created in the mid to late 1980s by Icon Lowell Adonis Khanh (Lowell Thomas Hickman, (1986)); Icon Eric Christian-Bazaar; and Icon [[Mother Juan Aviance]], founder and Mother of [[House of Aviance]] (1989\u2014present).

ProjectVOGUE researchers utilized the House \"family\" structure by taking 15 \"mothers\", \"fathers\", founders, and more on a retreat to gauge the community's knowledge of HIV, while encouraging them to teach their \"children\" about HIV prevention.

April 25, 2018</ref> The structure of Houses is widely used among drag queens today, as well as associated notions of community and family. Attitudes of defiance and subversion, that were necessary for black, latino, queer, and trans participants, as they navigated discrimination, exclusion, and the ravages of the AIDS epidemic, form an essential part of drag culture as a whole.\n\nBall-culture terms are sometimes used more generally; \"drag mother\" may apply to any drag queen in a mentorship role, and \"drag house\" may refer to a group of drag performers allied personally or professionally. \"Fierce\" and \"fierceness,\" \"work it\" and \"working it,\" \"fabulous\" and \"fabulousness\" are heard in ''Paris Is Burning'' and appeared in the lyrics of \"[[Supermodel (You Better Work)]]\", a 1992 hit by [[drag queen]] [[RuPaul]]. These terms became more widely used in [[gay slang]], fashion industry [[jargon]] and mainstream [[colloquialism|colloquial]] language.<ref>''Fantabulosa: A Dictionary of Polari and Gay Slang'' by Paul Baker</ref>\n\n* Reading: to read a person is to highlight and exaggerate all of the flaws of a person, from their ridiculous clothes, to their flawed makeup and anything else the reader can come up with.

The conversation helps Lloyd see sense, and he tells Steve that he is grateful for helping him cope through the confession. Lloyd struggles to cope with losing Cheryl and Russ and at one point he grabs [[Karl Munro]] ([[John Michie]]) by the throat when he jokes about Cheryl. Lloyd sets fire to his sofa in the street as Cheryl and Chris watch.

Lloyd then sets up a rival taxi firm called Fare Ladies and begins poaching Steve's clients and staff. Lloyd hires [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]), but fires her after he realises she has been sabotaging his cars. Lloyd makes up with Steve and starts working for Street Cars again under the basis that they do not mention their earlier arguments. Lloyd becomes enemies with Karl, after he cheats on Stella with [[Sunita Alahan]] ([[Shobna Gulati]]). Lloyd fires Karl and refuses to acknowledge his existence, but Karl warns him that he will get him back.\n\nIn September 2012, Lloyd has a chance encounter at a gig with an old friend, [[List of Coronation Street characters (2012)#Mandy Kamara|Mandy Kamara]] ([[Pamela Nomvete]]).

This causes a rift between Lloyd's family and Paul but Paul's partner, Eileen Grimshaw, is trapped between the two as Lloyd is her colleague and one of her best friends. The argument between the two sides continue, with Eileen determined to end the feud. Sophie, who is involved with Jenna, contacts the fire service where Paul works and makes a formal complaint about his racist remark. Paul finds this out via his manager and believes Lloyd made the complaint as an act of revenge, trying to get him sacked from his job. He subsequently finds Lloyd near the pub, pins him up against the wall and hits him. Jenna is walking across the street and noticed and she subsequently tells Paul that it was Sophie who made the complaint. However, the police are present as they had been called by [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]) to investigate problems at his bar. Nick's wife [[Leanne|Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]) tells the police they are not needed, so they divert their attention to Paul and Lloyd and they take Paul down to the station for questioning due to his violent behaviour. Finally, Paul gives in and apologises to Lloyd, but there is still tension between the two. Mandy and Lloyd's relationship is almost as shaken by Eileen and Paul's. Events escalate and Lloyd and Mandy split.\n\nPaul has another encounter with Lloyd when Eileen convinces him and Steve to go out to a bar with Paul for his birthday.

He begins to chat up the barmaid, who is brown skinned. He invites her out, but then decides to abandon his drink and leave after he sees the unwelcome attention they are attracting. He bumps into Paul, who has come back for him, on the way out, but while distracted, he is surrounded by the men from the pub, who seek to rough him up. Paul intervenes, and one of the men 'questions his allegiances'. Paul ignores this, and tells them to back off. They return to the bar, and Paul and Lloyd begin to walk home. Paul apologises to Lloyd, but Lloyd, believing Paul's language instigated the encounter, shuns him, returning home alone. Later, when Paul leaves the street for good, Lloyd and Steve comfort Eileen, to no avail.\n\nLloyd later begins a relationship with [[Andrea Beckett]] ([[Hayley Tamaddon]]), a friend of Steve's from college.
