Located approximately {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Toronto]], Kitchener is the regional seat. Kitchener was called '''[[Berlin to Kitchener name change|Berlin]]''' until 1916; it was designated the Town of Berlin from 1854 until 1912 and the City of Berlin from 1912 until 1916.\n\nThe City of Kitchener covers an area of 136.86 square kilometres and had a population of 233,222 at the time of the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]]. The Kitchener [[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|metropolitan area]], which includes the smaller, neighbouring cities of [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] to the north and [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] to the south, has 523,894 people, making it the tenth largest [[Census Metropolitan Area]] (CMA) in Canada and the fourth largest CMA in Ontario.\n\nKitchener and Waterloo are considered \"twin cities\" which are often referred to jointly as \"Kitchener\u2013Waterloo\" (K\u2013W), although they have separate [[Municipal government in Canada|municipal governments]]. Including Cambridge, the three cities are known as \"[[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|the Tri-Cities]]\". All are part of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, which was created in 1973, when it replaced Waterloo County, which had been created in 1853.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\n===Geography===\nKitchener is located in [[Southwestern Ontario]], in the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands]]. This geological and climatic region has wet-climate soils and deciduous forests. Situated in the Grand River Valley, the area is generally above {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in elevation.\n\nKitchener is the largest city within the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] watershed, and the largest city on the Haldimand Tract. Just to the west of the city is [[Baden Hill]], in [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot Township]]. This glacial [[kame]] remnant formation is the highest elevation for many miles. The other dominant glacial feature is the [[Waterloo Moraine]], which snakes its way through the region and holds a significant quantity of [[artesian wells]], from which the city derives most of its drinking water. The settlement's first name, Sandhills, is an accurate description of the higher points of the moraine.\n\n===Climate===\nKitchener has a [[humid continental climate]] of the warm summer subtype (''Dfb'' under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]); there are large seasonal differences, usually warm and humid summers and cold to occasionally very cold winters. Winter-like conditions generally last from the mid-December until mid-March, while summer temperatures generally occur between mid-May to close to the end of September.\n\nMarch 2012 went down in the history books for Kitchener \u2013 between 16 and 22 March, temperatures ranged from {{convert|21.4|C|F|1}} to {{convert|27.0|C|F|1}}\u20147 record highs in a row. 19 March high of {{convert|24|C|F|1}} is one of the highest winter temperatures ever recorded, while 22 March high of {{convert|27|C|F|1}} is the highest for March in this area.\n\nTemperatures during the year can exceed {{convert|30|C|F|1}} in the summer and drop below {{convert|-20|C|F|1}} in the winter several times a year, but prolonged periods of extreme temperatures are rare.  The frost-free period for Kitchener averages about 147 frost-free days a year,<ref name=climate /> a much more limited number than cities on the Great Lakes due its inland location and higher elevation. Snowfall averages {{convert|160|cm|in|0}}  per year; high, but not nearly as high as areas more directly affected by [[lake effect snow]].\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Kitchener was {{convert|38.3|C|0}} on August 6 & 7, 1918 and July 27, 1941.<ref name=\"August 1918\"/><ref name=\"July 1941\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-34.1|C|1}} on February 16, 2015.<ref name=\"February 2015\"/>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Region of Waterloo International Airport]], 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1914\u2013present{{efn|Daily maximum and minimum

hectare area given to the [[Iroquois|Six Nations]] by the British as a gift for their allegiance during the [[American Revolution]]. Between 1796 and 1798, the Six Nations sold 38,000 hectares of this land to [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] Colonel [[Richard Beasley (politician)|Richard Beasley]].  The portion of land that Beasley purchased was remote but of great interest to German [[Mennonite]] farming families from [[Pennsylvania]]. They wanted to live in an area that would allow them to practice their beliefs without persecution. Eventually, the Mennonites purchased all of Beasley's unsold land creating 160 farm tracts.\n\nMany of the pioneers arriving from Pennsylvania, known as the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] or Pennsilfaanisch-Deitsche (German, not \"modern\" Dutch), after November 1803 bought land in a 60,000-acre section of Block Two from the German Company which was established by a group of Mennonites from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The tract included most of Block 2 of the previous Grand River Indian Lands.

In 1816 the Government of Upper Canada designated the settlement the Township of Waterloo.\n\nMuch of the land, made up of [[moraine]]s and swampland interspersed with rivers and streams, was converted to farmland and roads.  [[Rock Pigeon|Wild pigeons]], which once swarmed by the tens of thousands, were driven from the area.  Apple trees were introduced to the region by John Eby in the 1830s, and several [[gristmill|grist-]] and [[saw mill|sawmills]] (most notably Joseph Schneider's 1816 sawmill, John and [[Abraham Erb]]'s grist- and sawmills and Eby's cider mill) were erected throughout the area.  Schneider built Berlin's first road, from his home to the corner of King Street and Queen Street (then known as Walper corner).  $1000 was raised by the settlers to extend the road from Walper corner to Huether corner, where the Huether Brewery was built and the [[Huether Hotel]] now stands in the city of Waterloo; a petition to the government for $100 to assist in completing the project was denied.\n\nLater named the founder of Berlin, [[Benjamin Eby]] (made Mennonite preacher in 1809, and bishop in 1812) arrived from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania in 1806 and purchased a large tract of land consisting of much of what would become the village of Berlin (named about 1830).

Other German-speaking immigrants from Europe arrived during the 1830s to 1850s, bringing with them their language, religion and cultural traditions. The German community became industrial and political leaders, and created a German-Canadian society unlike any other found in Canada at the time.

The Princess of Wales Chapter of the [[Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire]] raised the $6,000 needed for the monument.<ref>[http://www.kpl.org/ref/gsr/trivia.html Kitchener Public Library Trivia Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513105151/http://www.kpl.org/ref/gsr/trivia.html |date=13 May 2012 }}</ref>\n[[File:victoria-park-kitchener-lake.jpg|thumb|right|Victoria Park]]\n\nAnother significant beauty spot in the city is Rockway Gardens. Adjacent to the Rockway golf course, the gardens occupy a long narrow strip of land alongside King Street as it rushes down to meet the Conestoga Parkway and become Highway 8. Here there are many fountains, ponds, waterfalls and rock grottoes. It is a popular site for wedding photos in the summer.\n\nKitchener has an extensive and safe community trail system. The trails, which are controlled and run by the city, are hundreds of kilometres in length. Due to Kitchener's close proximity to the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]], several community trails and paths border the river's shores. This convenient access to the Grand River has drawn nature-seeking tourists to the city. However, Kitchener's trails and especially natural areas remain underfunded by city council and as a result, many are not adequately maintained.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/Files/Item/item9645_csd-06-105_-_park___trails.pdf |title=Staff report regarding state of Kitchener's park system |publisher=Kitchener.ca |accessdate=10 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316205637/http://www.kitchener.ca/Files/Item/item9645_csd-06-105_-_park___trails.pdf |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, a bike park at the newly constructed McLennan Park, in the city's south end, was hailed as one of the best city-run bike parks in [[Southern Ontario]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.therecord.com/News/Local/article/565847 |title=TheRecord \u2013 21 Rosedene Avenue |publisher=News.therecord.com |date=19 July 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> by [[Freestyle BMX|BMX]] and [[mountain biking]] enthusiasts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://therecord.blogs.com/take_the_lane/2007/07/kitcheners-new-.html |title=Take the Lane: Kitchener's new bike park |publisher=Therecord.blogs.com |date=21 July 2007 |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708021409/http://therecord.blogs.com/take_the_lane/2007/07/kitcheners-new-.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The bike park offers a [[Four-cross|four-cross (4X)]] section, a [[Freestyle BMX|pump track]] section, a [[Dirt jumping|jump park]], and a [[Flatland BMX|free-ride]] course.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/pdf/parks_mclennan_bike.pdf |title=City of Kitchener |publisher=Kitchener.ca |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706184531/http://www.kitchener.ca/pdf/parks_mclennan_bike.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> McLennan Park also features an accessible play area, a splash pad, basketball courts, beach volleyball courts, a leash-free dog area, and a toboggan hill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/MclennanPark.asp |title=City of Kitchener \u2013 McLennan Park |publisher=City of Kitchener |accessdate=10 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729151656/http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/MclennanPark.asp |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Chicopee Ski Club]] is also within the city limits.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Highways and expressways===\n[[File:Highway 401 Grand River.jpg|thumb|left|[[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] in Kitchener looking east towards the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]]]]\n[[File:Conestoga.jpg|thumb|right|[[Highway 8 (Ontario)|Highway 8]] as seen from Franklin Street bridge]]\nKitchener was very proactive and visionary about its transportation network in the 1960s, with the province undertaking at that time construction of the [[Conestoga Parkway]] from the western boundary (just past Homer Watson Boulevard) across the south side of the city and looping north along the Grand River to Northfield Drive in Waterloo.\nSubsequent upgrades took the Conestoga west beyond Trussler Road and north towards [[St. Jacobs, Ontario|St Jacobs]], with eight lanes through its middle stretch.\n\nThe Conestoga Parkway bears the provincial highway designations of Highways [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|7]] and [[Highway 8 (Ontario)|8]]. King Street becomes Hwy 8 where it meets the Conestoga in the south and leads down to the 401, but Old King Street survives as the street-route through Freeport to the Preston area of [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]]. Up until construction of the Conestoga, Highland Road through [[Baden, Ontario|Baden]] had been the primary highway to [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]]. Victoria Street was then and remains the primary highway to [[Guelph]] but this is slated to be bypassed with an entirely new highway beginning at the Wellington Street exit and running roughly north of and parallel to the old route.\n\nThere are two interchanges with [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] on Kitchener's southern border. In addition to the primary link where Hwy 8 merges into the Hwy 401, there is another interchange on the west side with Homer Watson Boulevard.\n\nIn order to reduce the congestion on Highway 8, a new interchange has been proposed on Highway 401 at Trussler Road, which would serve the rapidly growing west side of Kitchener. Although this proposal is supported by the Region of Waterloo, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation has no plans to proceed with an interchange at Trussler Road.\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title = '''Destinations from Kitchener'''\n|Northwest = [[Wellesley, Ontario|Wellesley]]\n|North     = [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]] <br /><small>''via [[Conestoga Parkway]]''</small>\n|Northeast = [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Elora, Ontario|Elora]], [[Fergus, Ontario|Fergus]]\n|West      = [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot]], [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]] <br /><small>''via [[Conestoga Parkway]]''</small>\n|Centre    = Kitchener\n|East      = [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Guelph]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|Highway 7]]''</small>\n|Southwest = [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]]''</small>\n|South     = [[North Dumfries, Ontario|North Dumfries]], [[Paris, Ontario|Paris]]\n|Southeast = [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 8 (Ontario)|Highway 8]]''</small>\n}}\n\n===City streets===\nUnlike most southern Ontario cities whose streets follow a strict British grid survey pattern, Kitchener's streets are laid out in a complex radial pattern on the Continental models most familiar to the German settlers.\n\nThere is good historical reason for this. Kitchener was one of the few places in Ontario where the settlers arrived in advance of government surveyors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The Mennonites who had banded together as the German Company to purchase the township from Richard Beasley simply divided their vast parcel of land by the number of shareholder households and then drew random lots to confer title on individual farms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} There was no grid survey done\u2014no lines, no concessions, no right-of-way corridors for roads. When it came time to punch roads through the wilderness, the farmers modelled the road network on what was familiar to them, which was the pattern of villages in Switzerland and southern Germany.\n\nThis is a Continental Radial pattern and the result was major streets extended through diagonals cutting across the grid of smaller streets and converging at multiple-point intersections which, as the communities became more prosperous and if the automobile had not displaced the horse, might someday have become [[roundabouts]] decorated with circular gardens, fountains or statuary in the style of European cities. Five-point intersections created by converging diagonals are legion in the older areas.\n\nIn 2004, [[roundabouts]] were introduced to the Region of Waterloo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingaround/roundabouts.asp |title=Roundabouts \u2013 Region of Waterloo |publisher=Regionofwaterloo.ca |accessdate=10 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619124821/http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingAround/roundabouts.asp |archivedate=19 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Besides improving traffic flow, they will help the region lower pollution from emissions created by idling vehicles. In 2006, the first two were installed along Ira Needles Boulevard in Kitchener. Some people{{Who|date=February 2017}} argue roundabouts are ideal for intersections in this region because of the aforementioned historical growth along Continental radial patterns versus the British grid systems, but all installs have been at T and cross intersections making the point irrelevant.\n\nA controversial plan would extend River Road through an area known as Hidden Valley,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |title=Strengthening Community |publisher=Waterlooians.ca |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706212813/http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> but the pressure of traffic and the absence of any other full east-west arterials between Fairway Road and the Highway 401 is forcing this development ahead.\n\nMost streets that cross the municipal boundary between Kitchener and [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] retain the same street name in both cities. However, several streets which are divided into east and west sections in Kitchener shift to a north-south division in Waterloo. This primarily affects [[Weber Street|Weber]] and [[Waterloo Regional Road 15|King]] Streets and Westmount Road. Since these roads do not actually change their primary directional alignment significantly, (Weber Street and King Street, supposedly \"Parallel\" streets, cross 3 times), the shift in labelling can create confusion, since each of the aforementioned thoroughfares bears the labels north, south, west, and east on certain segments. However, it also reduces the potential confusion that would result from having separate west and east segments of the same street existing simultaneously in both cities.\n\nThe problem with giving streets in Waterloo Region compass-based labels, and attempting to divide each of the cities into quadrants comes from the radial layout of the roads, and the historical patterns of development. Waterloo's quadrants, created by the intersection of King and Erb Streets, roughly correspond to compass directions, but Kitchener's quadrants, delineated by King and Queen Streets, do not resemble compass directions whatsoever. A notable case is that of Lancaster Street, which runs almost exactly north-south, but is designated as east-west, since it crosses Queen Street, which divides the \"east\" and \"west\" halves of the city, yet follows a northeast-southwest orientation itself.\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:GrandRiverTransit3.jpg|thumb|GRT iXpress bus (since adapted into the ION bus service)]]\nSince 2000, public transport throughout the [[Waterloo Regional Municipality, Ontario|Region of Waterloo]] has been provided by [[Grand River Transit]], which was created by a merger of the former Cambridge Transit and Kitchener Transit.

Further complicating things is that the first area of development named Stanley Park, which is where Stanley Park school is located and where Stanley Park Conservation Area is located, has been included within the city's planning district of Heritage Park, leaving only later-developed areas of Stanley Park plus an adjacent residential neighbourhood to the south, originally referred to as Sunnyside, in the Stanley Park planning neighbourhood.  The Forest Heights Neighbourhood Association includes the Forest Hills neighbourhood/planning district to the east of Forest Heights proper.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/NeighbourhoodAssociations.asp |title=City of Kitchener |publisher=Kitchener.ca |accessdate=5 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908075809/http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/NeighbourhoodAssociations.asp |archivedate=8 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Sports==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Professional teams\n|-<!-- Table Header -->\n!

Located approximately {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Toronto]], Kitchener is the regional seat. Kitchener was called '''[[Berlin to Kitchener name change|Berlin]]''' until 1916; it was designated the Town of Berlin from 1854 until 1912 and the City of Berlin from 1912 until 1916.\n\nThe City of Kitchener covers an area of 136.86 square kilometres and had a population of 233,222 at the time of the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]]. The Kitchener [[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|metropolitan area]], which includes the smaller, neighbouring cities of [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] to the north and [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] to the south, has 523,894 people, making it the tenth largest [[Census Metropolitan Area]] (CMA) in Canada and the fourth largest CMA in Ontario.\n\nKitchener and Waterloo are considered \"twin cities\" which are often referred to jointly as \"Kitchener\u2013Waterloo\" (K\u2013W), although they have separate [[Municipal government in Canada|municipal governments]]. Including Cambridge, the three cities are known as \"[[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|the Tri-Cities]]\". All are part of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, which was created in 1973, when it replaced Waterloo County, which had been created in 1853.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\n===Geography===\nKitchener is located in [[Southwestern Ontario]], in the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands]]. This geological and climatic region has wet-climate soils and deciduous forests. Situated in the Grand River Valley, the area is generally above 300m (1000') in elevation.\n\nKitchener is the largest city within the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] watershed, and the largest city on the Haldimand Tract. Just to the west of the city is [[Baden Hill]], in [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot Township]]. This glacial [[kame]] remnant formation is the highest elevation for many miles. The other dominant glacial feature is the [[Waterloo Moraine]], which snakes its way through the region and holds a significant quantity of [[artesian wells]], from which the city derives most of its drinking water. The settlement's first name, Sandhills, is an accurate description of the higher points of the moraine.\n\n===Climate===\nKitchener has a [[humid continental climate]] of the warm summer subtype (''Dfb'' under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]); there are large seasonal differences, usually warm and humid summers and cold to occasionally very cold winters. Winter-like conditions generally last from the mid-December until mid-March, while summer temperatures generally occur between mid-May to close to the end of September.\n\nMarch 2012 went down in the history books for Kitchener \u2013 between 16 and 22 March, temperatures ranged from {{convert|21.4|C|F|1}} to {{convert|27.0|C|F|1}}\u20147 record highs in a row. 19 March high of {{convert|24|C|F|1}} is one of the highest winter temperatures ever recorded, while 22 March high of {{convert|27|C|F|1}} is the highest for March in this area.\n\nTemperatures during the year can exceed {{convert|30|C|F|1}} in the summer and drop below {{convert|-20|C|F|1}} in the winter several times a year, but prolonged periods of extreme temperatures are rare.  The frost-free period for Kitchener averages about 147 frost-free days a year,<ref name=climate /> a much more limited number than cities on the Great Lakes due its inland location and higher elevation. Snowfall averages {{convert|160|cm|in|0}}  per year; high, but not nearly as high as areas more directly affected by [[lake effect snow]].\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Kitchener was {{convert|38.3|C|0}} on August 6 & 7, 1918 and July 27, 1941.<ref name=\"August 1918\"/><ref name=\"July 1941\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-34.1|C|1}} on February 16,

hectare area given to the [[Iroquois|Six Nations]] by the British as a gift for their allegiance during the [[American Revolution]]. Between 1796 and 1798, the Six Nations sold 38,000 hectares of this land to [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] Colonel [[Richard Beasley (politician)|Richard Beasley]].  The portion of land that Beasley purchased was remote but of great interest to German [[Mennonite]] farming families from [[Pennsylvania]]. They wanted to live in an area that would allow them to practice their beliefs without persecution. Eventually, the Mennonites purchased all of Beasley's unsold land creating 160 farm tracts.\n\nMany of the pioneers arriving from Pennsylvania, known as the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] or Pennsilfaanisch-Deitsche (German, not \"modern\" Dutch), after November 1803 bought land in a 60,000-acre section of Block Two from the German Company which was established by a group of Mennonites from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The tract included most of Block 2 of the previous Grand River Indian Lands. Many of the first farms were least four hundred acres in size.<ref name=\"whs pdf 1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.whs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1930.pdf |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1930 |website=Waterloo Historical Society 1930 Annual Meeting |publisher=Waterloo Historical Society |access-date=13 March 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227233215/http://www.whs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1930.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"kitchener.foundlocally.com\">{{cite web |url=http://kitchener.foundlocally.com/Local/Info-CityHistoryToConfederation.htm |title=Kitchener\u2013Waterloo Ontario History \u2013 To Confederation |accessdate=2017-08-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525125004/http://kitchener.foundlocally.com/Local/Info-CityHistoryToConfederation.htm |archivedate=25 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The German Company, represented by Daniel Erb and Samuel Bricker, had acquired the land from previous owner Richard Beasley; he had gotten into financial difficulties after buying the land in 1796 from Joseph Brant who represented the Six Nations.

In 1816 the Government of Upper Canada designated the settlement the Township of Waterloo.\n\nMuch of the land, made up of [[moraine]]s and swampland interspersed with rivers and streams, was converted to farmland and roads.  [[Rock Pigeon|Wild pigeons]], which once swarmed by the tens of thousands, were driven from the area.  Apple trees were introduced to the region by John Eby in the 1830s, and several [[gristmill|grist-]] and [[saw mill|sawmills]] (most notably Joseph Schneider's 1816 sawmill, John and [[Abraham Erb]]'s grist- and sawmills and Eby's cider mill) were erected throughout the area.  Schneider built Berlin's first road, from his home to the corner of King Street and Queen Street (then known as Walper corner).  $1000 was raised by the settlers to extend the road from Walper corner to Huether corner, where the Huether Brewery was built and the [[Huether Hotel]] now stands in the city of Waterloo; a petition to the government for $100 to assist in completing the project was denied.\n\nLater named the founder of Berlin, [[Benjamin Eby]] (made Mennonite preacher in 1809, and bishop in 1812) arrived from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania in 1806 and purchased a large tract of land consisting of much of what would become the village of Berlin (named about 1830).

Here there are many fountains, ponds, waterfalls and rock grottoes. It is a popular site for wedding photos in the summer.\n\nKitchener has an extensive and safe community trail system. The trails, which are controlled and run by the city, are hundreds of kilometres in length. Due to Kitchener's close proximity to the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]], several community trails and paths border the river's shores. This convenient access to the Grand River has drawn nature-seeking tourists to the city. However, Kitchener's trails and especially natural areas remain underfunded by city council and as a result, many are not adequately maintained.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/Files/Item/item9645_csd-06-105_-_park___trails.pdf |title=Staff report regarding state of Kitchener's park system |publisher=Kitchener.ca |accessdate=10 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316205637/http://www.kitchener.ca/Files/Item/item9645_csd-06-105_-_park___trails.pdf |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, a bike park at the newly constructed McLennan Park, in the city's south end, was hailed as one of the best city-run bike parks in [[Southern Ontario]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.therecord.com/News/Local/article/565847 |title=TheRecord \u2013 21 Rosedene Avenue |publisher=News.therecord.com |date=19 July 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> by [[Freestyle BMX|BMX]] and [[mountain biking]] enthusiasts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://therecord.blogs.com/take_the_lane/2007/07/kitcheners-new-.html |title=Take the Lane: Kitchener's new bike park |publisher=Therecord.blogs.com |date=21 July 2007 |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708021409/http://therecord.blogs.com/take_the_lane/2007/07/kitcheners-new-.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The bike park offers a [[Four-cross|four-cross (4X)]] section, a [[Freestyle BMX|pump track]] section, a [[Dirt jumping|jump park]], and a [[Flatland BMX|free-ride]] course.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/pdf/parks_mclennan_bike.pdf |title=City of Kitchener |publisher=Kitchener.ca |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706184531/http://www.kitchener.ca/pdf/parks_mclennan_bike.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> McLennan Park also features an accessible play area, a splash pad, basketball courts, beach volleyball courts, a leash-free dog area, and a toboggan hill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/MclennanPark.asp |title=City of Kitchener \u2013 McLennan Park |publisher=City of Kitchener |accessdate=10 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729151656/http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/MclennanPark.asp |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Chicopee Ski Club]] is also within the city limits.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Highways and expressways===\n[[File:Highway 401 Grand River.jpg|thumb|left|[[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] in Kitchener looking east towards the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]]]]\n[[File:Conestoga.jpg|thumb|right|[[Highway 8 (Ontario)|Highway 8]] as seen from Franklin Street bridge]]\nKitchener was very proactive and visionary about its transportation network in the 1960s, with the province undertaking at that time construction of the [[Conestoga Parkway]] from the western boundary (just past Homer Watson Boulevard) across the south side of the city and looping north along the Grand River to Northfield Drive in Waterloo.\nSubsequent upgrades took the Conestoga west beyond Trussler Road and north towards [[St. Jacobs, Ontario|St Jacobs]], with eight lanes through its middle stretch.\n\nThe Conestoga Parkway bears the provincial highway designations of Highways [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|7]] and [[Highway 8 (Ontario)|8]]. King Street becomes Hwy 8 where it meets the Conestoga in the south and leads down to the 401, but Old King Street survives as the street-route through Freeport to the Preston area of [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]]. Up until construction of the Conestoga, Highland Road through [[Baden, Ontario|Baden]] had been the primary highway to [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]]. Victoria Street was then and remains the primary highway to [[Guelph]] but this is slated to be bypassed with an entirely new highway beginning at the Wellington Street exit and running roughly north of and parallel to the old route.\n\nThere are two interchanges with [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] on Kitchener's southern border. In addition to the primary link where Hwy 8 merges into the Hwy 401, there is another interchange on the west side with Homer Watson Boulevard.\n\nIn order to reduce the congestion on Highway 8, a new interchange has been proposed on Highway 401 at Trussler Road, which would serve the rapidly growing west side of Kitchener. Although this proposal is supported by the Region of Waterloo, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation has no plans to proceed with an interchange at Trussler Road.\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title = '''Destinations from Kitchener'''\n|Northwest = [[Wellesley, Ontario|Wellesley]]\n|North     = [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]] <br /><small>''via [[Conestoga Parkway]]''</small>\n|Northeast = [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Elora, Ontario|Elora]], [[Fergus, Ontario|Fergus]]\n|West      = [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot]], [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]] <br /><small>''via [[Conestoga Parkway]]''</small>\n|Centre    = Kitchener\n|East      = [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Guelph]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|Highway 7]]''</small>\n|Southwest = [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]]''</small>\n|South     = [[North Dumfries, Ontario|North Dumfries]], [[Paris, Ontario|Paris]]\n|Southeast = [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 8 (Ontario)|Highway 8]]''</small>\n}}\n\n===City streets===\nUnlike most southern Ontario cities whose streets follow a strict British grid survey pattern, Kitchener's streets are laid out in a complex radial pattern on the Continental models most familiar to the German settlers.\n\nThere is good historical reason for this. Kitchener was one of the few places in Ontario where the settlers arrived in advance of government surveyors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The Mennonites who had banded together as the German Company to purchase the township from Richard Beasley simply divided their vast parcel of land by the number of shareholder households and then drew random lots to confer title on individual farms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} There was no grid survey done\u2014no lines, no concessions, no right-of-way corridors for roads. When it came time to punch roads through the wilderness, the farmers modelled the road network on what was familiar to them, which was the pattern of villages in Switzerland and southern Germany.\n\nThis is a Continental Radial pattern and the result was major streets extended through diagonals cutting across the grid of smaller streets and converging at multiple-point intersections which, as the communities became more prosperous and if the automobile had not displaced the horse, might someday have become [[roundabouts]] decorated with circular gardens, fountains or statuary in the style of European cities. Five-point intersections created by converging diagonals are legion in the older areas.\n\nIn 2004, [[roundabouts]] were introduced to the Region of Waterloo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingaround/roundabouts.asp |title=Roundabouts \u2013 Region of Waterloo |publisher=Regionofwaterloo.ca |accessdate=10 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619124821/http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingAround/roundabouts.asp |archivedate=19 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Besides improving traffic flow, they will help the region lower pollution from emissions created by idling vehicles. In 2006, the first two were installed along Ira Needles Boulevard in Kitchener. Some people{{Who|date=February 2017}} argue roundabouts are ideal for intersections in this region because of the aforementioned historical growth along Continental radial patterns versus the British grid systems, but all installs have been at T and cross intersections making the point irrelevant.\n\nA controversial plan would extend River Road through an area known as Hidden Valley,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |title=Strengthening Community |publisher=Waterlooians.ca |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706212813/http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> but the pressure of traffic and the absence of any other full east-west arterials between Fairway Road and the Highway 401 is forcing this development ahead.\n\nMost streets that cross the municipal boundary between Kitchener and [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] retain the same street name in both cities. However, several streets which are divided into east and west sections in Kitchener shift to a north-south division in Waterloo. This primarily affects [[Weber Street|Weber]] and [[Waterloo Regional Road 15|King]] Streets and Westmount Road. Since these roads do not actually change their primary directional alignment significantly, (Weber Street and King Street, supposedly \"Parallel\" streets, cross 3 times), the shift in labelling can create confusion, since each of the aforementioned thoroughfares bears the labels north, south, west, and east on certain segments. However, it also reduces the potential confusion that would result from having separate west and east segments of the same street existing simultaneously in both cities.\n\nThe problem with giving streets in Waterloo Region compass-based labels, and attempting to divide each of the cities into quadrants comes from the radial layout of the roads, and the historical patterns of development. Waterloo's quadrants, created by the intersection of King and Erb Streets, roughly correspond to compass directions, but Kitchener's quadrants, delineated by King and Queen Streets, do not resemble compass directions whatsoever. A notable case is that of Lancaster Street, which runs almost exactly north-south, but is designated as east-west, since it crosses Queen Street, which divides the \"east\" and \"west\" halves of the city, yet follows a northeast-southwest orientation itself.\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:GrandRiverTransit3.jpg|thumb|GRT iXpress bus (since adapted into the ION bus service)]]\nSince 2000, public transport throughout the [[Waterloo Regional Municipality, Ontario|Region of Waterloo]] has been provided by [[Grand River Transit]], which was created by a merger of the former Cambridge Transit and Kitchener Transit.

It runs approximately east\u2013west through the northern section of downtown Kitchener. It was originally laid out and constructed in 1856 by the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR), and after the GTR's acquisition of the [[Great Western Railway (Ontario)|Great Western Railway]], the mainline through Kitchener became known informally as the \"North Main Line\" in contrast with the \"South Main Line\" through [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]], both connecting [[London, Ontario|London]] and [[Toronto]]. Coming from the east, the [[Waterloo Spur]] diverges from the mainline and heads north through [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] and ultimately to [[Elmira, Ontario|Elmira]]. The spur was formerly owned by CN, but is now owned by the [[Region of Waterloo]] and leased to the [[Goderich-Exeter Railway]] (GEXR), a shortline freight railway.\n\n[[Kitchener station]] lies a short distance west along the track from the junction with the Waterloo Spur. The current station building dates from 1897 and is a heritage structure which is owned by [[Via Rail]], Canada's national passenger railway. Both Via Rail [[Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor (Via Rail)|''Corridor'']] service and [[GO Transit]] [[Kitchener line]] service are available at the station, the latter of which has its western terminus at the station. Via Rail service consists of two trains per day in each direction along the Toronto\u2013London\u2013Sarnia route; one westbound train terminates at [[Sarnia station|Sarnia]] while another terminates at [[London station (Ontario)|London]], while both eastbound trains terminate at [[Toronto Union Station]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/summer2020/24-25_Toronto-London-Sarnia.pdf |title=Toronto-London-Sarnia |access-date=8 March 2020 |publisher=[[Via Rail]]}}</ref> GO train service was originally extended to Kitchener in 2011 from its previous western terminus at [[Georgetown, Ontario|Georgetown]].<ref name=2011kitchenerline>{{cite news |url=https://www.therecord.com/sports-story/2567786-go-trains-to-run-from-kitchener-to-toronto-in-2011/ |title=GO trains to run from Kitchener to Toronto in 2011 |date=13 November 2010 |newspaper=[[Waterloo Region Record]] |access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref> GO service began with two trains per direction per weekday,<ref name=2011kitchenerline /> but since its inception train frequency has gradually increased and as of early 2020 it stands at 8 eastbound and 7 westbound trains per weekday, with no weekend service.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gotransit.com/static_files/gotransit/assets/pdf/TripPlanning/FullSchedules/FS11012020/Table31.pdf |publisher=[[GO Transit]] |access-date=8 March 2020 |title=Kitchener GO Train and Bus Schedule}}</ref> In 2017, [[Metrolinx]] (the parent agency of GO Transit) constructed a purpose-built train layover facility on Shirley Avenue to supplement its existing adapted layover facility, which was at capacity.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metrolinxengage.com/sites/default/files/waterloo_region_council_august_30_final.pdf |publisher=[[Metrolinx]] |website=Metrolinx Engage |title=Creating Connections in Waterloo Region |date=30 August 2017 |access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhile Kitchener benefits from increasingly frequent commuter-oriented GO service east to Toronto, intercity Via Rail service to the city has been largely unchanged for years, limiting its connectivity to [[Southwestern Ontario]] to the west. In contrast, the South Main Line through Brantford (which is still owned by CN) has faster and more frequent service between Toronto and London than the North Main Line does, along with larger double-tracked sections. In 2017, the Ontario Liberal government proposed a Windsor\u2013Toronto [[high-speed rail]] line through Kitchener, which would improve travel times to nearby major cities as well as to the [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Bill|title=Province initiates EA for high-speed rail|url=https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7325518-province-initiates-ea-for-high-speed-rail/|publisher=Kitchener Post|accessdate=25 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328004435/https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7325518-province-initiates-ea-for-high-speed-rail/|archivedate=28 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The proposal, if approved, would provide a 48-minute trip from Kitchener to downtown Toronto.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toronto \u2013 Kitchener \u2013 London Ontario High Speed Rail Pre-Feasibility Study prepared for Ontario Ministry of Transport Commercial in Confidence|url=http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/publications/pdfs/toronto-kitchener-london-ontario-high-speed-rail-feasibility-study.pdf|website=mto.gov.on.ca|accessdate=25 June 2017|page=8|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704192850/http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/publications/pdfs/toronto-kitchener-london-ontario-high-speed-rail-feasibility-study.pdf|archivedate=4 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> With the election of a new [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Conservative]] government, funding for the project was indefinitely paused.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/ontario-pauses-high-speed-rail-funding-will-look-at-enhancing-current-services |title=Ontario pauses high-speed rail funding, will look at enhancing current services |date=15 April 2019 |access-date=8 March 2020 |first=Shawn |last=Jeffords |newspaper=The [[National Post]]}}</ref>\n\nFreight trains in Kitchener are operated by the [[Goderich-Exeter Railway]] and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].

It was fought between [[Union Army|Union]] [[Major General]] [[Nathaniel Prentice Banks]] against [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Major General]] [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]] during Banks\u2019s operations against the [[Bayou Teche]] region near [[Franklin, Louisiana|Franklin]], the seat of [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary Parish]] in southern [[Louisiana]].\n\n==Prelude==\nWhile the other two Union [[XIX Corps (ACW)|XIX Corps]] divisions under Nathaniel Prentice Banks were comprising the expedition into west [[Louisiana]] crossed [[Berwick Bay]] towards [[Fort Bisland]], [[Brigadier General]] [[Cuvier Grover]]\u2019s division went up the [[Atchafalaya River]] into [[Grand Lake (Louisiana)|Grand Lake]], where they could either block a Confederate retreat, or force a retreat if the Confederates stayed and fought at Fort Bisland. The battle occurred two days after the [[Battle of Fort Bisland]].\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:BattleofIrishBend.png|thumb|200px|left|Map of the Battle of Irish Bend]]\n[[File:Irish_Bend_Battlefield_Louisiana.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Irish Bend Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]].]]\nOn the morning of April 13, 1863, Grover\u2019s division landed in the vicinity of Franklin and scattered Confederate troops attempting to stop them from disembarking. That night Grover ordered the division to cross [[Bayou Teche]] and prepare for an attack towards [[Franklin, Louisiana]], at dawn. Meanwhile, however, Major General Richard Taylor reacted, feeling the obvious threat to his rear. He started withdrawing his forces from Fort Bisland, and his advance guard arrived quickly. On the morning of April 14, Taylor and his men were at Nerson\u2019s Woods, around a mile and a half above Franklin. As Grover\u2019s lead brigade marched out a few miles, it found Taylor\u2019s men on its right and skirmishing began. The fighting became intense; the Confederates attacked, forcing the Federal soldiers to fall back. The gunboat ''Diana'' arrived and anchored the Confederate right flank on the Teche. Still, Grover\u2019s men outnumbered the Confederates and when he paused to deploy his full force, Taylor withdrew rather than risk a pitched battle against superior numbers. Grover\u2019s men had taken the strategic position they sought. This victory, along with the one at Fort Bisland, two days earlier, assured the success of the expedition into west Louisiana.\n\n==Opposing Forces==\n\n===Union===\n[[Army of the Gulf]]\u2014Major General [[Nathaniel P.

As Grover\u2019s lead brigade marched out a few miles, it found Taylor\u2019s men on its right and skirmishing began. The fighting became intense; the Confederates attacked, forcing the Federal soldiers to fall back. The gunboat ''Diana'' arrived and anchored the Confederate right flank on the Teche. Still, Grover\u2019s men outnumbered the Confederates and when he paused to deploy his full force, Taylor withdrew rather than risk a pitched battle against superior numbers. Grover\u2019s men had taken the strategic position they sought. This victory, along with the one at Fort Bisland, two days earlier, assured the success of the expedition into west Louisiana.\n\n==Opposing Forces==\n\n===Union===\n[[Army of the Gulf]]\u2014Major General [[Nathaniel P.

Players control Joel, a smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl, [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]], across a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] United States. ''The Last of Us'' is played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. Players use firearms and [[improvised weapons]], and can use [[Stealth game|stealth]] to defend against hostile humans and [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] creatures infected by a mutated strain of the ''[[Cordyceps]]'' fungus. In the [[Multiplayer video game|online multiplayer]] mode, up to eight players engage in [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and competitive gameplay.\n\n[[Development of The Last of Us|Development of ''The Last of Us'']] began in 2009, soon after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game, ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]''. For the first time in the company's history, Naughty Dog split into two teams; while one team developed ''[[Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception]]'', the other half developed ''The Last of Us''. The relationship between Joel and Ellie became the focus, with all other elements developed around it. Actors [[Troy Baker]] and [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]] portrayed Joel and Ellie respectively through [[Voice acting|voice]] and [[motion capture]], and assisted creative director [[Neil Druckmann]] with the development of the characters and story. The [[Music of The Last of Us|original score]] was composed and performed by [[Gustavo Santaolalla]].\n\nFollowing its announcement in December 2011, ''The Last of Us'' was widely anticipated. It was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] in June 2013, and for the [[PlayStation 4]] in July 2014.{{efn|name=Remastered}} Upon release, it received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its narrative, gameplay, visuals, sound design, [[characterization]], and depiction of female characters. ''The Last of Us'' became one of the [[list of best-selling video games|best-selling video games of all time]], selling over 1.3 million units in its first week and 17 million by April 2018. The game [[List of accolades received by The Last of Us|won year-end accolades]], including multiple [[Game of the Year]] awards from several gaming publications, critics, and game award ceremonies, and is considered one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]].\n\nAfter the game's release, Naughty Dog released several [[downloadable content]] additions. ''[[The Last of Us: Left Behind]]'' adds a single-player campaign following Ellie and her best friend Riley. A sequel, ''[[The Last of Us Part II]],'' was announced in December 2016.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''The Last of Us'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[survival horror]] game played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]].<ref name=\"Kotaku Review\" /> The player traverses across [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] environments such as towns, buildings, forest and sewers to advance the story. The player can use firearms, [[improvised weapons]], and [[Stealth game|stealth]] to defend against hostile humans and [[Zombie (fiction)|cannibalistic]] creatures infected by a mutated strain of the ''[[Cordyceps]]'' fungus. For most of the game, the player takes control of Joel, a man tasked with escorting a young girl, [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]], across the United States.<ref name=\"announcement\"/> The player also controls Ellie throughout the game's winter segment.<ref name=\"Grounded\"/>\n\nIn combat, the player can use long-range weapons, such as rifles, shotguns, and bows, and short-range weapons such as handguns and short-barreled shotguns. The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies.<ref name=\"Joystick bricks\"/> The player can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. Equipment such as health kits, [[shiv (weapon)|shiv]]s, and [[Molotov cocktail]]s can be found or crafted using collected items. Attributes such as the [[Health (gaming)|health meter]] and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged through the use of health kits.<ref name=\"Shacknews Crafting\"/>\n\n[[File:The Last of Us Listen Mode.jpg|thumb|260px|Listen Mode allows players to discover the position of enemies and characters by displaying their outline through walls, achieved through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness.<ref name=\"Listen Mode\"/>|alt=The player character is crouching, with his companion nearby. Enemies lurk in the distance, with a white outline alerting players of their location.|left]]\n\nThough the player can attack enemies directly, they can also use stealth to attack undetected or sneak by them. \"Listen Mode\" allows the player to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness, indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects.<ref name=\"Listen Mode\"/> In the dynamic [[cover system]], the player can crouch behind obstacles to gain a [[Positional advantage|tactical advantage]] during combat.<ref name=\"Metro review\"/> The game features periods without combat, often involving conversation between the characters.<ref name=\"PrimaGames Conversations\"/> The player can solve simple puzzles, such as using floating pallets to move Ellie, who is unable to swim, across bodies of water, and using ladders or dumpsters to reach higher areas. Story collectibles, such as notes, maps and comics, can be scavenged and viewed in the backpack menu.<ref name=\"GamesRadar Collectibles\"/>\n\nThe game features an artificial intelligence system by which hostile human enemies react to combat. If enemies discover the player, they may take cover or call for assistance, and can take advantage of the player when they are distracted, out of ammunition, or in a fight. Player companions, such as Ellie, can assist in combat by throwing objects at threats to stun them, announcing the location of unseen enemies, or using a knife and pistol to attack enemies.<ref name=\"AI\"/>\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\nThe [[Multiplayer video game|online multiplayer]] allows up to eight players to engage in competitive gameplay in recreations of multiple single-player settings. The game features three multiplayer game types: Supply Raid and Survivors are both team [[deathmatch]]es, with the latter excluding the ability to [[Spawning (video gaming)|respawn]];<ref name=\"Multiplayer\" /> Interrogation features teams investigating the location of the enemy team's [[Lock box|lockbox]], and the first to capture such lockbox wins.<ref name=\"IGN Multiplayer\" /> In every mode, players select a faction\u2014Hunters (a group of hostile survivors) or Fireflies (a revolutionary militia group)\u2014and keep their clan alive by collecting supplies during matches. Each match is equal to one day; by surviving twelve \"weeks\", players have completed a journey and can re-select their Faction.<ref name=\"PSBlog Multiplayer\" /> Killing enemies, reviving allies, and crafting items earn the player parts that can be converted to supplies; supplies can also be scavenged from enemies' bodies. Players are able to carry more equipment by earning points as their clan's supplies grow. Players can connect the game to their [[Facebook]] account, which alters clan members' names and faces to match the players' [[Facebook features#Friend|Facebook friends]].<ref name=\"GameSpot Multiplayer\" /> Players have the ability to customize their characters with hats, helmets, masks, and emblems.<ref name=\"GameSpot Executions\" /> The multiplayer servers for the PlayStation 3 version of the game were shut down on September 3, 2019.<ref name=\"GamesRadar Multiplayer\"/>\n\n== Plot ==\n{{See also|List of The Last of Us characters}}\n\nIn September 2013, an outbreak of a mutant ''Cordyceps'' fungus ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts into aggressive creatures known as the Infected. In the suburbs of [[Austin, Texas]], Joel ([[Troy Baker]]) flees the chaos with his brother Tommy ([[Jeffrey Pierce]]) and daughter Sarah ([[Hana Hayes]]). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in Joel's arms. Twenty years later, civilization has been decimated by the infection. Survivors live in heavily policed quarantine zones, independent settlements, and nomadic groups. Joel works as a smuggler with his partner Tess ([[Annie Wersching]]) in the quarantine zone in the [[North End, Boston|North End]] of [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]. They hunt down Robert ([[Robin Atkin Downes]]), a [[black market|black-market]] dealer, to recover a stolen weapons cache. Before Tess kills him, Robert reveals that he traded the cache with the Fireflies, a rebel [[militia]] opposing the quarantine zone authorities.\n\nThe leader of the Fireflies, Marlene ([[Merle Dandridge]]), promises to double their cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl, [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]] ([[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]]), to Fireflies hiding in the [[Massachusetts State House]] outside the quarantine zone. Joel, Tess, and Ellie sneak out in the night, but after an encounter with a government patrol, they discover Ellie is infected. Full infection normally occurs in under two days, but Ellie claims she was infected three weeks earlier and that her immunity may lead to a cure. The trio make their way to their destination through hordes of the infected, but find that the Fireflies there have been killed. Tess reveals she has been bitten by an infected and, believing in Ellie's importance, sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he can locate the remaining Fireflies. With the help of Bill ([[W. Earl Brown]]), a smuggler and survivalist who owes Joel a favor, they acquire a working vehicle from Bill's neighborhood. Driving into [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], Joel and Ellie are ambushed by bandits and their car is wrecked. They ally with two brothers, Henry ([[Brandon Scott (actor)|Brandon Scott]]) and Sam ([[Nadji Jeter]]). After they escape the city, Sam is bitten by an infected but hides it from the group. As his infection takes hold, Sam attacks Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead and immediately afterwards commits suicide out of grief.\n\nIn the fall, Joel and Ellie finally find Tommy in Jackson County, Wyoming, where he has assembled a fortified settlement near a [[hydroelectric]] dam with his wife Maria ([[Ashley Scott]]). Joel decides to leave Ellie with Tommy, but after she confronts him about Sarah, he decides to let her stay with him. Tommy directs them to a Fireflies enclave at the University of Eastern Colorado. They find the university abandoned, but learn that the Fireflies have moved to a hospital in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]]. Afterward, the two are attacked by bandits and Joel is severely wounded while escaping.\n\nDuring the winter, Ellie and Joel shelter in the mountains. Joel is on the brink of death and relies on Ellie to care for him. Hunting for food, Ellie encounters David ([[Nolan North]]) and James ([[Reuben Langdon]]), scavengers willing to trade medicine for food; despite initially appearing friendly and cooperative, David turns hostile after revealing the university bandits were part of his group. Ellie manages to lead David's group away from Joel, but is eventually captured; David intends to recruit her into his cannibal group. Refusing the offer, she escapes after killing James, but David corners her in a burning restaurant. Meanwhile, Joel recovers from his wounds and sets out to find Ellie. He reaches Ellie as she kills David and breaks down crying; Joel comforts her before they flee.\n\nIn the spring, Joel and Ellie arrive in Salt Lake City. Ellie is rendered unconscious after almost drowning, before they are captured by a Firefly patrol. In the hospital, Marlene tells Joel that Ellie is being prepared for surgery: in hope of producing a vaccine for the infection, the Fireflies must remove the infected portion of Ellie's brain, which will kill her. Unwilling to let Ellie die, Joel battles his way to the operating room and carries the unconscious Ellie to the parking garage. He is confronted by Marlene, whom he shoots and kills to prevent the Fireflies from pursuing them. On the drive out of the city, when Ellie wakes up, Joel claims that the Fireflies had found many other immune people but were unable to create a cure, and that they have stopped trying. On the outskirts of Tommy's settlement, Ellie expresses her [[survivor guilt]]. At her insistence, Joel swears his story about the Fireflies is true.<ref>{{cite video game |title=The Last of Us |developer=[[Naughty Dog]] |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=June 14, 2013 |platform=[[PlayStation 3]] |version=1.0 }}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n{{Main|Development of The Last of Us}}\n{{multiple image\n| footer = [[Bruce Straley]] (left) and [[Neil Druckmann]] (right) led development as game director and creative director respectively.<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/>\n| align = \n| direction = \n| width = \n| image1 = Bruce Straley PAX Prime 2014.jpg\n| width1 = 145\n| alt1 = A 35-year-old man with short brown hair, smiling and looking at something to the right of the camera.\n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Neil Druckmann SDCC 2014.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = A 35-year-old man with curly black hair talking into a microphone, looking at something to the left of the camera.\n| caption2 = \n}}\n[[Naughty Dog]] began [[Development of The Last of Us|developing ''The Last of Us'']] in 2009, following the release of ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]''.

The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles.

Players control Joel, a smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl, [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]], across a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] United States. ''The Last of Us'' is played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]]. Players use firearms and [[improvised weapons]], and can use [[Stealth game|stealth]] to defend against hostile humans and [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] creatures infected by a mutated strain of the ''[[Cordyceps]]'' fungus. In the [[Multiplayer video game|online multiplayer]] mode, up to eight players engage in [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] and competitive gameplay.\n\n[[Development of The Last of Us|Development of ''The Last of Us'']] began in 2009, soon after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game, ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]''. For the first time in the company's history, Naughty Dog split into two teams; while one team developed ''[[Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception]]'', the other half developed ''The Last of Us''. The relationship between Joel and Ellie became the focus, with all other elements developed around it. Actors [[Troy Baker]] and [[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]] portrayed Joel and Ellie respectively through [[Voice acting|voice]] and [[motion capture]], and assisted creative director [[Neil Druckmann]] with the development of the characters and story. The [[Music of The Last of Us|original score]] was composed and performed by [[Gustavo Santaolalla]].\n\nFollowing its announcement in December 2011, ''The Last of Us'' was widely anticipated. It was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] in June 2013, and for the [[PlayStation 4]] in July 2014.{{efn|name=Remastered}} Upon release, it received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its narrative, gameplay, visuals, sound design, [[characterization]], and depiction of female characters. ''The Last of Us'' became one of the [[list of best-selling video games|best-selling video games of all time]], selling over 1.3 million units in its first week and 17 million by April 2018. The game [[List of accolades received by The Last of Us|won year-end accolades]], including multiple [[Game of the Year]] awards from several gaming publications, critics, and game award ceremonies, and is considered one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]].\n\nAfter the game's release, Naughty Dog released several [[downloadable content]] additions. ''[[The Last of Us: Left Behind]]'' adds a single-player campaign following Ellie and her best friend Riley. A sequel, ''[[The Last of Us Part II]],'' was announced in December 2016, and is scheduled for release on May 29, 2020.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''The Last of Us'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[survival horror]] game played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]].<ref name=\"Kotaku Review\" /> The player traverses across [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] environments such as towns, buildings, forest and sewers to advance the story. The player can use firearms, [[improvised weapons]], and [[Stealth game|stealth]] to defend against hostile humans and [[Zombie (fiction)|cannibalistic]] creatures infected by a mutated strain of the ''[[Cordyceps]]'' fungus. For most of the game, the player takes control of Joel, a man tasked with escorting a young girl, [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]], across the United States.<ref name=\"announcement\"/> The player also controls Ellie throughout the game's winter segment.<ref name=\"Grounded\"/>\n\nIn combat, the player can use long-range weapons, such as rifles, shotguns, and bows, and short-range weapons such as handguns and short-barreled shotguns. The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack enemies.<ref name=\"Joystick bricks\"/> The player can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. Equipment such as health kits, [[shiv (weapon)|shiv]]s, and [[Molotov cocktail]]s can be found or crafted using collected items. Attributes such as the [[Health (gaming)|health meter]] and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health can be recharged through the use of health kits.<ref name=\"Shacknews Crafting\"/>\n\n[[File:The Last of Us Listen Mode.jpg|thumb|260px|Listen Mode allows players to discover the position of enemies and characters by displaying their outline through walls, achieved through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness.<ref name=\"Listen Mode\"/>|alt=The player character is crouching, with his companion nearby. Enemies lurk in the distance, with a white outline alerting players of their location.|left]]\n\nThough the player can attack enemies directly, they can also use stealth to attack undetected or sneak by them. \"Listen Mode\" allows the player to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness, indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects.<ref name=\"Listen Mode\"/> In the dynamic [[cover system]], the player can crouch behind obstacles to gain a [[Positional advantage|tactical advantage]] during combat.<ref name=\"Metro review\"/> The game features periods without combat, often involving conversation between the characters.<ref name=\"PrimaGames Conversations\"/> The player can solve simple puzzles, such as using floating pallets to move Ellie, who is unable to swim, across bodies of water, and using ladders or dumpsters to reach higher areas. Story collectibles, such as notes, maps and comics, can be scavenged and viewed in the backpack menu.<ref name=\"GamesRadar Collectibles\"/>\n\nThe game features an artificial intelligence system by which hostile human enemies react to combat. If enemies discover the player, they may take cover or call for assistance, and can take advantage of the player when they are distracted, out of ammunition, or in a fight. Player companions, such as Ellie, can assist in combat by throwing objects at threats to stun them, announcing the location of unseen enemies, or using a knife and pistol to attack enemies.<ref name=\"AI\"/>\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\nThe [[Multiplayer video game|online multiplayer]] allows up to eight players to engage in competitive gameplay in recreations of multiple single-player settings. The game features three multiplayer game types: Supply Raid and Survivors are both team [[deathmatch]]es, with the latter excluding the ability to [[Spawning (video gaming)|respawn]];<ref name=\"Multiplayer\" /> Interrogation features teams investigating the location of the enemy team's [[Lock box|lockbox]], and the first to capture such lockbox wins.<ref name=\"IGN Multiplayer\" /> In every mode, players select a faction\u2014Hunters (a group of hostile survivors) or Fireflies (a revolutionary militia group)\u2014and keep their clan alive by collecting supplies during matches. Each match is equal to one day; by surviving twelve \"weeks\", players have completed a journey and can re-select their Faction.<ref name=\"PSBlog Multiplayer\" /> Killing enemies, reviving allies, and crafting items earn the player parts that can be converted to supplies; supplies can also be scavenged from enemies' bodies. Players are able to carry more equipment by earning points as their clan's supplies grow. Players can connect the game to their [[Facebook]] account, which alters clan members' names and faces to match the players' [[Facebook features#Friend|Facebook friends]].<ref name=\"GameSpot Multiplayer\" /> Players have the ability to customize their characters with hats, helmets, masks, and emblems.<ref name=\"GameSpot Executions\" /> The multiplayer servers for the PlayStation 3 version of the game were shut down on September 3, 2019.<ref name=\"GamesRadar Multiplayer\"/>\n\n== Plot ==\n{{See also|List of The Last of Us characters}}\n\nIn September 2013, an outbreak of a mutant ''Cordyceps'' fungus ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts into aggressive creatures known as the Infected. In the suburbs of [[Austin, Texas]], Joel ([[Troy Baker]]) flees the chaos with his brother Tommy ([[Jeffrey Pierce]]) and daughter Sarah ([[Hana Hayes]]). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in Joel's arms. Twenty years later, civilization has been decimated by the infection. Survivors live in heavily policed quarantine zones, independent settlements, and nomadic groups. Joel works as a smuggler with his partner Tess ([[Annie Wersching]]) in the quarantine zone in the [[North End, Boston|North End]] of [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]]. They hunt down Robert ([[Robin Atkin Downes]]), a [[black market|black-market]] dealer, to recover a stolen weapons cache. Before Tess kills him, Robert reveals that he traded the cache with the Fireflies, a rebel [[militia]] opposing the quarantine zone authorities.\n\nThe leader of the Fireflies, Marlene ([[Merle Dandridge]]), promises to double their cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl, [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]] ([[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]]), to Fireflies hiding in the [[Massachusetts State House]] outside the quarantine zone. Joel, Tess, and Ellie sneak out in the night, but after an encounter with a government patrol, they discover Ellie is infected. Full infection normally occurs in under two days, but Ellie claims she was infected three weeks earlier and that her immunity may lead to a cure. The trio make their way to their destination through hordes of the infected, but find that the Fireflies there have been killed. Tess reveals she has been bitten by an infected and, believing in Ellie's importance, sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he can locate the remaining Fireflies. With the help of Bill ([[W. Earl Brown]]), a smuggler and survivalist who owes Joel a favor, they acquire a working vehicle from Bill's neighborhood. Driving into [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], Joel and Ellie are ambushed by bandits and their car is wrecked. They ally with two brothers, Henry ([[Brandon Scott (actor)|Brandon Scott]]) and Sam ([[Nadji Jeter]]). After they escape the city, Sam is bitten by an infected but hides it from the group. As his infection takes hold, Sam attacks Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead and immediately afterwards commits suicide out of grief.\n\nIn the fall, Joel and Ellie finally find Tommy in Jackson County, Wyoming, where he has assembled a fortified settlement near a [[hydroelectric]] dam with his wife Maria ([[Ashley Scott]]). Joel decides to leave Ellie with Tommy, but after she confronts him about Sarah, he decides to let her stay with him. Tommy directs them to a Fireflies enclave at the University of Eastern Colorado. They find the university abandoned, but learn that the Fireflies have moved to a hospital in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]]. Afterward, the two are attacked by bandits and Joel is severely wounded while escaping.\n\nDuring the winter, Ellie and Joel shelter in the mountains. Joel is on the brink of death and relies on Ellie to care for him. Hunting for food, Ellie encounters David ([[Nolan North]]) and James ([[Reuben Langdon]]), scavengers willing to trade medicine for food; despite initially appearing friendly and cooperative, David turns hostile after revealing the university bandits were part of his group. Ellie manages to lead David's group away from Joel, but is eventually captured; David intends to recruit her into his cannibal group. Refusing the offer, she escapes after killing James, but David corners her in a burning restaurant. Meanwhile, Joel recovers from his wounds and sets out to find Ellie. He reaches Ellie as she kills David and breaks down crying; Joel comforts her before they flee.\n\nIn the spring, Joel and Ellie arrive in Salt Lake City. Ellie is rendered unconscious after almost drowning, before they are captured by a Firefly patrol. In the hospital, Marlene tells Joel that Ellie is being prepared for surgery: in hope of producing a vaccine for the infection, the Fireflies must remove the infected portion of Ellie's brain, which will kill her. Unwilling to let Ellie die, Joel battles his way to the operating room and carries the unconscious Ellie to the parking garage. He is confronted by Marlene, whom he shoots and kills to prevent the Fireflies from pursuing them. On the drive out of the city, when Ellie wakes up, Joel claims that the Fireflies had found many other immune people but were unable to create a cure, and that they have stopped trying. On the outskirts of Tommy's settlement, Ellie expresses her [[survivor guilt]]. At her insistence, Joel swears his story about the Fireflies is true.<ref>{{cite video game |title=The Last of Us |developer=[[Naughty Dog]] |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=June 14, 2013 |platform=[[PlayStation 3]] |version=1.0 }}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n{{Main|Development of The Last of Us}}\n{{multiple image\n| footer = [[Bruce Straley]] (left) and [[Neil Druckmann]] (right) led development as game director and creative director respectively.<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/>\n| align = \n| direction = \n| width = \n| image1 = Bruce Straley PAX Prime 2014.jpg\n| width1 = 145\n| alt1 = A 35-year-old man with short brown hair, smiling and looking at something to the right of the camera.\n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Neil Druckmann SDCC 2014.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = A 35-year-old man with curly black hair talking into a microphone, looking at something to the left of the camera.\n| caption2 = \n}}\n[[Naughty Dog]] began [[Development of The Last of Us|developing ''The Last of Us'']] in 2009, following the release of ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]''.

His father was also called Ptolemy and was a brother of Antigonus. Ptolemy, the nephew, was Antigonus's right-hand-man until his son [[Demetrius Poliorcetes|Demetrius]] took on a more prominent role.\n\nHe is first mentioned as being present with his uncle at the siege of [[Nora (Cappadocia)|Nora]] in 319 BC, when he was given up to [[Eumenes]] as a hostage for the safety of the latter during a conference with Antigonus.{{r|plut_10}} A few years later we find him entrusted by his uncle with commands of importance. In 315 BC, when Antigonus moved against the coalition of Diadochi formed against him, he placed Ptolemy at the head of an army which was marched to [[Asia Minor]] against the generals of [[Cassander]].\n\nThe young general successfully carried out his mission, relieving [[Samsun|Amisus]], which was besieged by Asclepiodorus, and recovered the whole [[satrap]]y of [[Cappadocia]]; after which he advanced into [[Bithynia]], compelling king [[Zipoites I of Bithynia|Zipoites]] to join Antigonus. Upon his approach and occupation of [[Ionia]], [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] withdrew from that territory.{{r|diod_19.57_60}} He made an alliance with [[Dionysius of Heraclea|Dionysius]] the tyrant of Heraclea, cemented by marrying the tyrant's daughter.<ref>[[Memnon of Heraclea|Memnon]], ''History of Heraclea'', F. 4, 6.</ref>\n\nIn the latter part of that year, Ptolemy next threatened [[Caria]], which was defended for a time by [[Myrmidon of Athens|Myrmidon]], a mercenary in service to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. In the following year (313 BC) Ptolemy was able to strike a decisive blow in that quarter against [[Eupolemus (general)|Eupolemus]], a general of Cassander, whom he surprised and totally defeated.{{r|diod_62_68}} Ptolemy had been attending his father's funeral when his opponent Assander (satrap of Karia) received reinforcements from his ally [[Cassander]] and decided to strike at Ptolemy's troops who were without their commander and scattered around Karia in winter quarters. He sent Eupolemus with 8,000 foot and 200 horse to take Ptolemy's forces by surprise. Ptolemy somehow got word of the surprise attack and ambushed Eupolemus, capturing his entire force.<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''Bibliotheca Historica'', xix. 68.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 313 BC, the arrival of Antigonus himself gave a decided preponderance to his arms in Anatolia, and Ptolemy, after rendering active assistance in the sieges of [[Kaunos]] and [[Iasus, Caria|Iasus]], was sent with a considerable army to [[Hellenistic Greece|Greece]] to carry on the war there against Cassander. His successes were at first rapid: he drove out the garrisons of his adversary from [[Chalcis]] and [[Oropos|Oropus]], invaded [[Attica]], where he compelled [[Athens]]' [[tyrant]] [[Demetrius Phalereus]] to make overtures of submission, and then carried his arms triumphantly through [[Boeotia]], [[Phocis]], and [[Locris]]. Wherever he went, he expelled Cassander's garrisons, and proclaimed the liberty and independence of the  cities.\n\nHe then directed his armies to the [[Peloponnese]], where the authority of Antigonus had been endangered by the recent defection of his general [[Telesphorus (general)|Telesphorus]] another nephew of Antigonus's.

His father was also called Ptolemy and was a brother of Antigonus. Ptolemy, the nephew, was Antigonus's right-hand-man until his son [[Demetrius Poliorcetes|Demetrius]] took on a more prominent role.\n\nHe is first mentioned as being present with his uncle at the siege of [[Nora (Cappadocia)|Nora]] in 319 BC, when he was given up to [[Eumenes]] as a hostage for the safety of the latter during a conference with Antigonus.{{r|plut_10}} A few years later we find him entrusted by his uncle with commands of importance. In 315 BC, when Antigonus moved against the coalition of Diadochi formed against him, he placed Ptolemy at the head of an army which was marched to [[Asia Minor]] against the generals of [[Cassander]].\n\nThe young general successfully carried out his mission, relieving [[Samsun|Amisus]], which was besieged by Asclepiodorus, and recovered the whole [[satrap]]y of [[Cappadocia]]; after which he advanced into [[Bithynia]], compelling king [[Zipoites I of Bithynia|Zipoites]] to join Antigonus. Upon his approach and occupation of [[Ionia]], [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] withdrew from that territory.{{r|diod_19.57_60}} He made an alliance with [[Dionysius of Heraclea|Dionysius]] the tyrant of Heraclea, cemented by marrying the tyrant's daughter.<ref>[[Memnon of Heraclea|Memnon]], ''History of Heraclea'', F. 4, 6.</ref>\n\nIn the latter part of that year, Ptolemy next threatened [[Caria]], which was defended for a time by [[Myrmidon of Athens|Myrmidon]], a mercenary in service to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. In the following year (313 BC) Ptolemy was able to strike a decisive blow in that quarter against [[Eupolemus (general)|Eupolemus]], a general of Cassander, whom he surprised and totally defeated.{{r|diod_62_68}} Ptolemy had been attending his father's funeral when his opponent Assander (satrap of Karia) received reinforcements from his ally [[Cassander]] and decided to strike at Ptolemy's troops who were without their commander and scattered around Karia in winter quarters. He sent Eupolemus with 8,000 foot and 200 horse to take Ptolemy's forces by surprise. Ptolemy somehow got word of the surprise attack and ambushed Eupolemus, capturing his entire force.<ref>[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca Historica]]'', xix. 68.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 313 BC, the arrival of Antigonus himself gave a decided preponderance to his arms in Anatolia, and Ptolemy, after rendering active assistance in the sieges of [[Kaunos]] and [[Iasus, Caria|Iasus]], was sent with a considerable army to [[Hellenistic Greece|Greece]] to carry on the war there against Cassander. His successes were at first rapid: he drove out the garrisons of his adversary from [[Chalcis]] and [[Oropos|Oropus]], invaded [[Attica]], where he compelled [[Athens]]' [[tyrant]] [[Demetrius Phalereus]] to make overtures of submission, and then carried his arms triumphantly through [[Boeotia]], [[Phocis]], and [[Locris]]. Wherever he went, he expelled Cassander's garrisons, and proclaimed the liberty and independence of the  cities.\n\nHe then directed his armies to the [[Peloponnese]], where the authority of Antigonus had been endangered by the recent defection of his general [[Telesphorus (general)|Telesphorus]] another nephew of Antigonus's. Ptolemy succeeded in bringing Teleshorus back into the fold.{{r|diod_75_77_78_87}} Here he appears to have remained till the peace of 311 suspended hostilities in that region.\n\nHe is thought to have considered that his services had not met with their due reward from Antigonus; and therefore, when in 310 BC Cassander and Ptolemy were preparing to renew the war, Ptolemy suddenly abandoned the cause of his uncle and concluded a treaty with Cassander and Ptolemy.
