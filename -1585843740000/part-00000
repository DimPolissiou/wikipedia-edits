He auditioned for the show on August 8, 2008 in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and was selected as a semifinalist following his \"Hollywood Week\" performances. Although he was not one of the three finalists chosen out of his semifinal performance group, he returned as a \"Wild Card.\" The judges saved Desai for last on Wild Card night and after announcing that [[Matt Giraud]] had made the Top 12, Simon Cowell then revealed the twist of Season 8: that Desai would also move onto the finals, leading to the first ever Top 13 in Idol history.\n\nDesai's first finals performance of [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Beat It]]\" was panned by the judges, with [[Simon Cowell]] saying that it was \"very lightweight\" and that he regretted choosing Desai for the Top 13. But Desai won the judges over again the next week, when he sang [[Willie Nelson]]'s classic country ballad \"[[Always On My Mind]]\" for \"[[Grand Ole Opry]] Week.\" Even Cowell was impressed, and retracted his remarks about Desai not deserving to be in the Top 13. Desai's rendition of [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s \"[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]\" three weeks later, which also garnered praise from the judges, prompted Cowell to compare the contestant to a \"yo-yo\", going back and forth between good and weak performances.\n\nNonetheless, Desai landed in the Bottom Two that week, just as he had the previous week. He finished in the Bottom Three during Top 7 week, when Matt Giraud was saved from elimination by the judges. This meant the next week would be a double elimination, wherein Desai ended up being voted off along with [[Lil Rounds]].\n\nCelebrities such as [[Ellen DeGeneres]] and [[Keith Urban]] said they favored Desai to win.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theboot.com/keith-urban-on-piano-serenades-and-idol-worship/|title=Keith Urban on Piano Serenades and 'Idol' Worship|last=Betts|first=Stephen L.|website=The Boot|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nDesai returned for the [[American Idol (season 8)#Finale|season finale]] of ''Idol'''s Season 8 to perform \"[[I'm Yours (Jason Mraz song)|I'm Yours]]\" with fellow ''Idol'' contestant Alexis Grace and singer [[Jason Mraz]].\n\n=== Performances/Results ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:Center;

He auditioned for the show on August 8, 2008 in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and was selected as a semifinalist following his \"Hollywood Week\" performances. Although he was not one of the three finalists chosen out of his semifinal performance group, he returned as a \"Wild Card.\" The judges saved Desai for last on Wild Card night and after announcing that [[Matt Giraud]] had made the Top 12, Simon Cowell then revealed the twist of Season 8: that Desai would also move onto the finals, leading to the first ever Top 13 in Idol history.\n\nDesai's first finals performance of [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Beat It]]\" was panned by the judges, with [[Simon Cowell]] saying that it was \"very lightweight\" and that he regretted choosing Desai for the Top 13. But Desai won the judges over again the next week, when he sang [[Willie Nelson]]'s classic country ballad \"[[Always On My Mind]]\" for \"[[Grand Ole Opry]] Week.\" Even Cowell was impressed, and retracted his remarks about Desai not deserving to be in the Top 13. Desai's rendition of [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s \"[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]\" three weeks later, which also garnered praise from the judges, prompted Cowell to compare the contestant to a \"yo-yo\", going back and forth between good and weak performances.\n\nNonetheless, Desai landed in the Bottom Two that week, just as he had the previous week. He finished in the Bottom Three during Top 7 week, when Matt Giraud was saved from elimination by the judges. This meant the next week would be a double elimination, wherein Desai ended up being voted off along with [[Lil Rounds]].\n\nCelebrities such as [[Ellen DeGeneres]] and [[Keith Urban]] said they favored Desai to win.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theboot.com/keith-urban-on-piano-serenades-and-idol-worship/|title=Keith Urban on Piano Serenades and 'Idol' Worship|last=Betts|first=Stephen L.|website=The Boot|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nDesai returned for the [[American Idol (season 8)#Finale|season finale]] of ''Idol'''s Season 8 to perform \"[[I'm Yours (Jason Mraz song)|I'm Yours]]\" with fellow ''Idol'' contestant Alexis Grace and singer [[Jason Mraz]].\n\n=== Performances/Results ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:Center;
