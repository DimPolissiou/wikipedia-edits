The wheelbase is {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}} shorter at {{convert|100.4|in|mm|abbr=on}} and an overall length {{convert|2.7|in|mm|abbr=on}} shorter at {{convert|167.1|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The overall width has been increased by {{convert|1.3|in|mm|abbr=on}}, the rear track by {{convert|2.2|in|mm|abbr=on}}, and overall height reduced by {{convert|0.3|in|mm|abbr=on}}. The smaller exterior dimensions and use of more lightweight materials helped reduce weight.\n\nThe 370Z features a front aluminum subframe, aluminum-alloy engine cradle, aluminum door panels, an all-aluminum hood, and an aluminum hatch. Front body torsional rigidity is improved by 10 percent with an extensively revised body structure, which includes a new front suspension cradle to reduce front body lateral bending, new rear structural reinforcements, and an underbody \"V-bar\" to help reduce rear lateral bending. Rear body torsional rigidity is improved by up to 22 percent and rear body vertical bending rigidity is improved by up to 30 percent. Additional enhancements include the use of a carbon fiber composite radiator housing and strengthening of the rear fender and hatch areas. The new structure weighs slightly less than the 350Z.\n\nThe 370Z uses a front double wishbone suspension, with forged aluminum control arms and steering knuckle. The rear multi-link suspension uses a forged aluminum upper control arm, lower arm and radius rod, the toe control rod is steel and wheel carrier assembly is aluminum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.insideline.com/roadtests/2009/04/2009-nissan-370z-suspension-walkaround.html|title=2009 Nissan 370Z: Suspension Walkaround|work=Edmunds}}</ref> The refreshed 2013 model uses new dampers with the Sport package models.

He is a nephew of Armenian revolutionary [[Krikor Amirian]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Early life===\nMardikian was born on November 7, 1903, in [[Bayburt]], in what was then the [[Ottoman Empire]], to Magar Mardikian and Haiganoush Amirian.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mardikian |first=George |title=Song of America |url=https://archive.org/details/songofamerica00mard |url-access=registration |year=1956 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn= |page= |pages=}}</ref> Mardikian grew up in the city of Scutari, an Armenian community in [[Constantinople]]. Mardikian's paternal family was one of warriors\u2014hence their family name: in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], 'Mardik' translates to 'warrior'. His maternal family, the Amirians, was an influential and powerful family in Bayburt. Mardikian's mother also was the eldest sibling of his idol, Krikor Amirian.\n\nAs a child, Mardikian was very chubby and carried the nickname 'shisko', which is Armenian for 'chubby'. Mardikian's father, Magar, was of one of the approximately 250 ethnic-Armenian intellectuals and community leaders arrested on April 24, 1915, known as [[Red Sunday]]. After his arrest, the Amirians were driven out of their homes and marched to [[Erzincan]]. Mardikian's maternal grandmother, Vartanoush Amirian, committed suicide by jumping in the [[Euphrates]], while the rest of the Amirian family was either beaten to death or burned alive. Witnessing the massacre of his mother's side of his family, Mardikian wanted to avenge their deaths and prove to his mother that he was a true warrior. As a result of his ambition, Mardikian ran away from his home and joined the [[Armenian volunteer units]], in which his uncle, Krikor Amirian, was a high-ranking member. After the First World War ended, Mardikian returned to his mother as a war hero.\n\nIn the summer of 1920, Mardikian worked with Captain Eddie Fox and George D. White of the Near East Relief organization to create an Armenian [[Boy Scout]] unit. It would be a short-lived accomplishment, since war broke out between the [[First Republic of Armenia]], Turkey, and Russia. Mardikian called on his fellow youths to continue the fight for freedom. When he returned to the battlefield, he was quickly captured and imprisoned. Mardikian served his term in prison in a sauerkraut factory where the Turkish guards forced the Armenian prisoners to chop ice, even though it was a useless activity. After serving two years in prison, Mardikian got lucky. George D. White, whom he had met a few years earlier, told the Turkish prison commandant that Mardikian was an American and demanded his freedom.<ref>{{cite serial |title=Why I Close My Restaurant |series=[[The Bob Edwards Show]] |network= |station= |location=San Francisco, California |airdate=August 21, 2009 |transcript=This I Believe, Inc. |transcripturl=http://thisibelieve.org/essay/16784/}}</ref> Mardikian eventually gained his freedom and returned to his mother and his surviving family members in Scutari. His mother, Haiganoush, and uncle, Krikor, advised him that he must go to the United States like his older sister Baidzar. Within a few days, he left Scutari.\n\nOne hour after Mardikian's ship left the port of Scutari, Turkish police knocked on Haiganoush's door demanding that they reveal the location of her son. The reason for this was that Mardikian stated he was a Near East Relief worker, which led to his freedom from prison. Haiganoush stated that her son had left this world and had entered a new one. Nonetheless, the Turkish police ransacked the home and finally left, assuming that he had died.\n\n===Arrival in the United States===\nMardikian arrived at [[Ellis Island]] on July 24, 1922.

He is a nephew of Armenian revolutionary [[Krikor Amirian]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Early life===\nMardikian was born on November 7, 1903, in [[Bayburt]], in what was then the [[Ottoman Empire]], to Magar Mardikian and Haiganoush Amirian.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mardikian |first=George |title=Song of America |url=https://archive.org/details/songofamerica00mard |url-access=registration |year=1956 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn= |page= |pages=}}</ref> Mardikian grew up in the city of Scutari, an Armenian community in [[Constantinople]]. Mardikian's paternal family was one of warriors\u2014hence their family name: in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], 'Mardik' translates to 'warrior'. His maternal family, the Amirians, was an influential and powerful family in Bayburt. Mardikian's mother also was the eldest sibling of his idol, Krikor Amirian.\n\nAs a child, Mardikian was very chubby and carried the nickname 'shisko', which is Armenian for 'chubby'. Mardikian's father, Magar, was of one of the approximately 250 ethnic-Armenian intellectuals and community leaders arrested on April 24, 1915, known as [[Red Sunday]]. After his arrest, the Amirians were driven out of their homes and marched to [[Erzincan]]. Mardikian's maternal grandmother, Vartanoush Amirian, committed suicide by jumping in the [[Euphrates]], while the rest of the Amirian family was either beaten to death or burned alive. Witnessing the massacre of his mother's side of his family, Mardikian wanted to avenge their deaths and prove to his mother that he was a true warrior. As a result of his ambition, Mardikian ran away from his home and joined the [[Armenian volunteer units]], in which his uncle, Krikor Amirian, was a high-ranking member. After the First World War ended, Mardikian returned to his mother as a war hero.\n\nIn the summer of 1920, Mardikian worked with Captain Eddie Fox and George D. White of the Near East Relief organization to create an Armenian [[Boy Scout]] unit. It would be a short-lived accomplishment, since war broke out between the [[First Republic of Armenia]], Turkey, and Russia. Mardikian called on his fellow youths to continue the fight for freedom. When he returned to the battlefield, he was quickly captured and imprisoned. Mardikian served his term in prison in a sauerkraut factory where the Turkish guards forced the Armenian prisoners to chop ice, even though it was a useless activity. After serving two years in prison, Mardikian got lucky. George D. White, whom he had met a few years earlier, told the Turkish prison commandant that Mardikian was an American and demanded his freedom.<ref>{{cite serial |title=Why I Close My Restaurant |series=[[The Bob Edwards Show]] |network= |station= |location=San Francisco, California |airdate=August 21, 2009 |transcript=This I Believe, Inc. |transcripturl=http://thisibelieve.org/essay/16784/}}</ref> Mardikian eventually gained his freedom and returned to his mother and his surviving family members in Scutari. His mother, Haiganoush, and uncle, Krikor, advised him that he must go to the United States like his older sister Baidzar. Within a few days, he left Scutari.\n\nOne hour after Mardikian's ship left the port of Scutari, Turkish police knocked on Haiganoush's door demanding that they reveal the location of her son. The reason for this was that Mardikian stated he was a Near East Relief worker, which led to his freedom from prison. Haiganoush stated that her son had left this world and had entered a new one. Nonetheless, the Turkish police ransacked the home and finally left, assuming that he had died.\n\n===Arrival in the United States===\nMardikian arrived at [[Ellis Island]] on July 24, 1922.
