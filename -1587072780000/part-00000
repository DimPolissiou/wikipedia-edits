Schwartze Memorial Catholic Center==\n[[File:Alphonse J. Schwartze Memorial Pastoral Center.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Alphonse J. Schwartze Memorial Catholic Center]]\nThe ''Alphonse J. Schwartze Memorial Catholic Center'' serves as the [[Diocesan chancery|chancery]] offices for the diocese of Jefferson City.  It is located adjacent to the [[Cathedral of Saint Joseph (Jefferson City, Missouri)|Cathedral of Saint Joseph]].  It is the pastoral center and a headquarters for the diocese.  The center is named in memory of [[Alphonse J. Schwartze]], a philanthropist who was the primary benefactor. Schwartze was a parishioner of St. Joseph's Church in [[Westphalia]], Missouri.  Groundbreaking for the center took place on April 1, 2004, with [[John R. Gaydos]], Bishop of Jefferson City, presiding.  Also, present was Schwartze's brother, Emil.  Blessing of the completed center took place on October 7, 2007.  Present for the blessing were Gaydos and bishops from neighboring dioceses in Missouri: [[Raymond L. Burke]], Archbishop of St. Louis; [[Robert Finn (bishop)|Robert W. Finn]], Bishop of Kansas City-Joseph; and [[John Joseph Leibrecht]], Bishop of Springfield-Cape Girardeau; [[Robert J. Herman]], Auxiliary Bishop of St. Louis.\n\n===History===\nThe chancery for the diocese had several addresses prior to the current one.  The first was a temporary one located at 505 Bolivar Street in Jefferson City.  The first permanent chancery was at 312 East Capitol Avenue from 1957 until 1968.  From 1968 until 2005, the chancery was located at 605 Clark Avenue in Jefferson City.\n\n===Features===\nThe building is {{convert|26795|sqft|m2}} and contains 47 rooms of various sizes, including a chapel and meeting rooms.\n\n===St. Alphonsus Chapel===\nThe Saint Alphonsus Chapel is dedicated to St. [[Alphonsus Liguori|Alphonsus Maria de Liguori]]. It is dominated by an imported 4\u00bd foot wooden image of Christ modeled after the [[Gero Crucifix]] of the [[Cologne Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Peter and the Virgin Mary]] in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]].  The selection of this [[crucifix]] was made in order to link the occupation of the building with [[World Youth Day]] which was held in Cologne in 2005.

Its ecclesiastical jurisdiction includes the northern and central parts of the state of [[Mississippi]], an area of {{convert|97,458|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. It is the largest diocese, by area, in the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]]. It was formerly known as the ''Diocese of Natchez'' (1837\u20131956) and the ''Diocese of Natchez-Jackson'' (1956\u201377). [[Jackson, Mississippi]] is the [[episcopal see]].\n\n==History==\nThe region which is now the Diocese of Jackson made its first contacts with the Catholic Church through French [[Jesuit]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] missionaries during the expeditions of [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]], [[Jacques Marquette|Marquette]], and [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville|d'Iberville]] in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1787, three [[Spain|Spanish]] priests, Fathers McKenna, White, and Savage, arrived at [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] from [[Salamanca]] and erected three missions in the vicinity. These missions, however, virtually disappeared after the Spanish turned over the area to the United States. Much valuable property was lost to the Church, and the efforts made to recover it were in vain.<ref name=Charles>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10709b.htm Charles, Brother. \"Natchez.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 26 February 2020{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe diocese was originally erected as the '''Vicariate Apostolic of Mississippi''', an administrative region of the church separate from the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of New Orleans|Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas (Saint Louis of New Orleans)]] to which it had previously belonged, and which itself would later become the Diocese of New Orleans on 18 July 1826. At the head of the Vicariate was [[Louis-Guillaume-Valentin Dubourg]], P.S.S., who served less than a year before being appointed [[bishop of Montauban]], [[France]] (he would eventually become the [[archbishop of Besan\u00e7on]]).\n\nThe Vicariate was elevated to the '''[[Natchesium|Diocese of Natchez]]''' on 28 July 1837. Although the Diocese of Natchez encompassed the entire state of Mississippi, nearly three years passed before [[John Mary Joseph Chanche]], S.S. (1795\u20131852), president of [[St. Mary's Seminary and University|St. Mary's College]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], was appointed as its first bishop on 15 December 1840.  Bishop Chanche, like his predecessor, was of French lineage, having been born to parents who had fled to Baltimore from the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] (present-day [[Haiti]]), presumably during the Haitian revolution. At his arrival in Mississippi, he found one priest in the diocese, a Father Brogard, who was there only temporarily. Chanche set to work building a diocesan infrastructure.\n\nIn 1842 Bishop Chanche laid the cornerstone of the [[St. Mary Basilica, Natchez|Cathedral of Our Lady of Sorrows]], designed by [[Robert Cary Long Jr.]] After the diocesan see was translated to Jackson, this became St. Mary's Basilica. In 1847 the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Sisters of Charity]] of Emmitsburg came to Natchez and established Saint Mary's Orphanage.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yt0Xrt7vcVYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=St.+Mary+Basilica,+Natchez&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwitg_y78dbnAhUsVd8KHfAOCFM4ChDoATAIegQIBxAC#v=onepage&q=St.%20Mary%20Basilica%2C%20Natchez&f=false Namorato, Michael V., ''The Catholic Church in Mississippi, 1911-1984: A History'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998, p. 7]{{ISBN|9780313307195}}</ref> Chanche attended the [[Plenary Councils of Baltimore|First Plenary Council]] of 1852, held in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].

That year, Bishop [[William Henry Elder]] refused to bend to orders from the Federal troops administering Natchez to compel his parishioners to pray for the [[President of the United States]]. For this act, Elder was tried, convicted, and then jailed briefly in [[Vidalia, Louisiana]], just across the [[Mississippi River]] from Natchez. Elder wrote to President Lincoln explaining that his refusal was not political, but based on the authority of the church to regulate church services. After officials in Washington intervened, Elder was ordered released on 12 August 1864.<ref name=glimpses>''Character Glimpses of Most Reverend William Henry Elder, D.D.,'' published by Frederick Pustet & Company, New York and Cincinnati, 1911</ref> As of 2006, Elder remains the second-longest-serving bishop in the diocese's history.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nBy the mid-20th century, the capitol of the state of Mississippi, [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], had grown to perhaps be a more appropriate center for the administration of the diocese. To reflect this fact, on 18 December 1956 the name was changed to '''Diocese of Natchez-Jackson'''. Finally, on 1 March 1977, the diocese was divided, with the southern counties of Mississippi being reorganized as the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Biloxi|Diocese of Biloxi]]. Concurrently, the Diocese of Natchez-Jackson became simply the Diocese of Jackson.  Since the relocation of the diocese to Jackson, the Diocese of Natchez has been maintained as a [[titular see]].\n\n===Sex Abuse===\nIn 2006, the Diocese of Jackson, Mississippi, settled a handful of lawsuits with 19 victims with a $5 million settlement which included an average payout of more than $250,000 for each survivor. In August 2019, it was revealed that a 35-year-old man named La Jarvis D. Love was sexually abused at a Franciscan Friar grade school in Greenwood, Mississippi, when he was a boy and that Order attempted to keep him silent in later years by offering him $15,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/catholic-church-settles-sex-abuse-case-southern-black-man-n1046816|title=After secrecy, Catholic church settles sex abuse case with black man|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Love and Wisconsin-based Franciscan Friar leader James Gannon secretly signed a non-disclosure agreement in January 2019 which insured that the order would give Love a financial settlement. This came in spite of the fact that the Catholic Church agreed to ban non-disclosure agreements. By August 30, the accused friar's name was revealed to be Paul West and Love's three cousins Joshua Love, La Jarvis Love and Raphael Love also accused him of sexually abusing them in the mid 1990s.<ref name=\"loveaccusations\">{{Cite web|url=https://msbusiness.com/2019/08/survivors-demand-us-investigation-of-mississippi-abuse-deals/|title=Survivors demand US investigation of Mississippi abuse deals {{!}}|last=Press|first=Associated|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nThe first seat of the diocese was [[St. Mary Basilica, Natchez|Saint Mary Basilica]] (then Cathedral) in Natchez, whose cornerstone was laid by Bishop Chanche in 1842. The current seat is the [[Cathedral of St. Peter the Apostle in Jackson]]. Since 1998, however, the church has maintained a [[minor basilica]] at the former cathedral in Natchez; it is now formally known as St. Mary Basilica.\n\nThe Diocese of Jackson encompasses an area of the United States that has historically been (and still is) overwhelmingly Protestant. Only about 2.6% of the residents in the diocese are considered Catholic (about 52,000 Catholics out of a total population of nearly 2 million).

Its ecclesiastical jurisdiction includes the northern and central parts of the state of [[Mississippi]], an area of {{convert|97,458|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. It is the largest diocese, by area, in the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]]. It was formerly known as the ''Diocese of Natchez'' (1837\u20131956) and the ''Diocese of Natchez-Jackson'' (1956\u201377). [[Jackson, Mississippi]] is the [[episcopal see]].\n\n==History==\nThe region which is now the Diocese of Jackson made its first contacts with the Catholic Church through French [[Jesuit]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] missionaries during the expeditions of [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]], [[Jacques Marquette|Marquette]], and [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville|d'Iberville]] in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1787, three [[Spain|Spanish]] priests, Fathers McKenna, White, and Savage, arrived at [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] from [[Salamanca]] and erected three missions in the vicinity. These missions, however, virtually disappeared after the Spanish turned over the area to the United States. Much valuable property was lost to the Church, and the efforts made to recover it were in vain.<ref name=Charles>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10709b.htm Charles, Brother. \"Natchez.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 26 February 2020{{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe diocese was originally erected as the '''Vicariate Apostolic of Mississippi''', an administrative region of the church separate from the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of New Orleans|Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas (Saint Louis of New Orleans)]] to which it had previously belonged, and which itself would later become the Diocese of New Orleans on 18 July 1826. At the head of the Vicariate was [[Louis-Guillaume-Valentin Dubourg]], P.S.S., who served less than a year before being appointed [[bishop of Montauban]], [[France]] (he would eventually become the [[archbishop of Besan\u00e7on]]).\n\nThe Vicariate was elevated to the '''[[Natchesium|Diocese of Natchez]]''' on 28 July 1837. Although the Diocese of Natchez encompassed the entire state of Mississippi, nearly three years passed before [[John Mary Joseph Chanche]], S.S. (1795\u20131852), president of [[St. Mary's Seminary and University|St. Mary's College]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], was appointed as its first bishop on 15 December 1840.  Bishop Chanche, like his predecessor, was of French lineage, having been born to parents who had fled to Baltimore from the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] (present-day [[Haiti]]), presumably during the Haitian revolution. At his arrival in Mississippi, he found one priest in the diocese, a Father Brogard, who was there only temporarily. Chanche set to work building a diocesan infrastructure. \n\nIn 1842 Bishop Chanche laid the cornerstone of the [[St. Mary Basilica, Natchez|Cathedral of Our Lady of Sorrows]], designed by [[Robert Cary Long Jr.]] After the diocesan see was translated to Jackson, this became St. Mary's Basilica. In 1847 the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Sisters of Charity]] of Emmitsburg came to Natchez and established Saint Mary's Orphanage.<ref> [https://books.google.com/books?id=yt0Xrt7vcVYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=St.+Mary+Basilica,+Natchez&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwitg_y78dbnAhUsVd8KHfAOCFM4ChDoATAIegQIBxAC#v=onepage&q=St.%20Mary%20Basilica%2C%20Natchez&f=false Namorato, Michael V., ''The Catholic Church in Mississippi, 1911-1984: A History'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 1998, p. 7]{{ISBN|9780313307195}}</ref> Chanche attended the [[Plenary Councils of Baltimore|First Plenary Council]] of 1852, held in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].

That year, Bishop [[William Henry Elder]] refused to bend to orders from the Federal troops administering Natchez to compel his parishioners to pray for the [[President of the United States]]. For this act, Elder was tried, convicted, and then jailed briefly in [[Vidalia, Louisiana]], just across the [[Mississippi River]] from Natchez. Elder wrote to President Lincoln explaining that his refusal was not political, but based on the authority of the church to regulate church services. After officials in Washington intervened, Elder was ordered released on 12 August 1864.<ref name=glimpses>''Character Glimpses of Most Reverend William Henry Elder, D.D.,'' published by Frederick Pustet & Company, New York and Cincinnati, 1911</ref> As of 2006, Elder remains the second-longest-serving bishop in the diocese's history.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nBy the mid-20th century, the capitol of the state of Mississippi, [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], had grown to perhaps be a more appropriate center for the administration of the diocese. To reflect this fact, on 18 December 1956 the name was changed to '''Diocese of Natchez-Jackson'''. Finally, on 1 March 1977, the diocese was divided, with the southern counties of Mississippi being reorganized as the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Biloxi|Diocese of Biloxi]]. Concurrently, the Diocese of Natchez-Jackson became simply the Diocese of Jackson.  Since the relocation of the diocese to Jackson, the Diocese of Natchez has been maintained as a [[titular see]].\n\n===Sex Abuse===\nIn 2006, the Diocese of Jackson, Mississippi, settled a handful of lawsuits with 19 victims with a $5 million settlement which included an average payout of more than $250,000 for each survivor. In August 2019, it was revealed that a 35-year-old man named La Jarvis D. Love was sexually abused at a Franciscan Friar grade school in Greenwood, Mississippi, when he was a boy and that Order attempted to keep him silent in later years by offering him $15,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/catholic-church-settles-sex-abuse-case-southern-black-man-n1046816|title=After secrecy, Catholic church settles sex abuse case with black man|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Love and Wisconsin-based Franciscan Friar leader James Gannon secretly signed a non-disclosure agreement in January 2019 which insured that the order would give Love a financial settlement. This came in spite of the fact that the Catholic Church agreed to ban non-disclosure agreements. By August 30, the accused friar's name was revealed to be Paul West and Love's three cousins Joshua Love, La Jarvis Love and Raphael Love also accused him of sexually abusing them in the mid 1990s.<ref name=\"loveaccusations\">{{Cite web|url=https://msbusiness.com/2019/08/survivors-demand-us-investigation-of-mississippi-abuse-deals/|title=Survivors demand US investigation of Mississippi abuse deals {{!}}|last=Press|first=Associated|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> \n\n==Demographics==\nThe first seat of the diocese was [[St. Mary Basilica, Natchez|Saint Mary Basilica]] (then Cathedral) in Natchez, whose cornerstone was laid by Bishop Chanche in 1842. The current seat is the [[Cathedral of St. Peter the Apostle in Jackson]]. Since 1998, however, the church has maintained a [[minor basilica]] at the former cathedral in Natchez; it is now formally known as St. Mary Basilica.\n\nThe Diocese of Jackson encompasses an area of the United States that has historically been (and still is) overwhelmingly Protestant. Only about 2.6% of the residents in the diocese are considered Catholic (about 52,000 Catholics out of a total population of nearly 2 million). The diocese contains 74 [[parish]]es and has 79 priests.\n\n==Bishops==\n===Bishops of Natchez===\n# [[John J. Chanche]], P.S.S. (1840\u20131852)\n# [[James Oliver Van de Velde]], S.J.
