Smith was an important figure in the [[Beat Generation]] scene in New York City, and his activities, such as his use of mind-altering substances and interest in [[Esotericism|esoteric]] [[spirituality]], anticipated aspects of the [[History of the hippie movement|Hippie movement]]. Besides his films, most notably his full length [[Cutout animation|cutout animated]] film ''[[Heaven and Earth Magic]]'' (1962), Smith is also widely known for his influential ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music]]'', drawn from his extensive collection of out-of-print commercial 78 rpm recordings.\n\nThroughout his life Smith was an inveterate collector. In addition to records, artifacts he collected included [[string figure]]s,<ref>A brochure accompanying an exhibit of Harry Smith's string figures stated: \"First described in Western anthropological literature by [[Franz Boas]] in 1888, these patterns \u2013 made by looping or weaving lengths of string into geometric forms or shapes that often evoke familiar objects \u2013 have been produced throughout history, both as a secular pastime and as a spiritual practice. When he died, Smith left an unfinished thousand-page manuscript on string figures, along with an extensive collection of figures that he had created\", [http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/harry-smith-string-figures/ \"Harry Smith: String Figures\", Cabinet Gallery, Brooklyn, N.Y. (September 19 through November 3, 2012)]</ref> [[paper airplanes]], [[Seminole textiles]], and [[Ukrainian Easter eggs]].\n\n==Biography==\nHarry Smith was born in Portland, Oregon, and spent his earliest years in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] in the area between [[Seattle]] and [[Bellingham]]. As a child he lived for a time with his family in [[Anacortes, Washington]], a town on [[Fidalgo Island]], where the [[Swinomish Reservation of Washington#Reservation|Swinomish Indian reservation]] is located.<ref>[[Ed Sanders]], biographical essay in Liner Notes to ''Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, Volume 4'', Revenant RVM 211 (2000), pp. 4\u20135.</ref> He attended high school in nearby [[Bellingham]].\n\nSmith's parents were [[Theosophism|Theosophists]] with [[Pantheism|Pantheistic]] tendencies (involving the belief in an immanent God who is identical with the Universe or nature), and both were fond of folk music. His mother, Mary Louise, originally from Sioux City, Iowa, came from a long line of school teachers and herself taught for a time on the [[Lummi]] Indian reservation near Bellingham. His father, Robert James Smith, a fisherman, worked as a watchman for the Pacific American Fishery, a salmon canning company. Smith's paternal great-grandfather John Corson Smith (d. 1910) had been a Union colonel in the [[American Civil War]], brevetted Brigadier General just as the war ended, and had served from 1885-89 as Lieutenant Governor of the state of Illinois. He had also been a prominent [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and had authored several books about the history of the order.<ref>[http://galenahistory.blogspot.com/2011/12/meet-generals-john-corson-smith.html \"Meet the Generals: John Corson Smith\"], Galena [Illinois] History (December, 2011).</ref>\n\nSmith's parents, who didn't get along, lived in separate houses, meeting only at dinner time. Although poor, they gave their son an artistic education, including 10 years of drawing and painting lessons. For a time, it is said, they even ran an art school in their house. Smith was also a voracious reader and he recalled his father bringing him a copy of [[Carl Sandburg]]'s folksong anthology, ''American Songbag''. \"We were considered some kind of 'low' family\", Smith once said, \"despite my mother's feeling that she was [an incarnation of] the Czarina of Russia\".<ref>[[Ed Sanders]], Liner Notes (2000), pp. 4\u20135.</ref> Friends recall that in high school Smith carried around a camera and in his high school yearbook said that he wanted to compose symphonic music.\n\nPhysically, Smith was undersized and had a curvature of the spine which kept him from being drafted (a circumstance that later would disqualify him from benefitting from the G.I. Bill). During World War II he took a job as a mechanic working nights on the construction of the tight, hard-to-reach interior of Boeing bomber planes, for which his short stature suited him.<ref>John Cohen wrote: \"Moe [Asch] first told me about Harry Smith, the man: that Smith was a little oddball guy \u2013 something of a hunchback \u2013 who had amassed his collection of 78 rpm records on the West Coast, and paid for it with his job working in the tight parts of World War II bombers.\" John Cohen in Liner Notes to ''Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, Volume 4'', Revenant RVM 211 (2000), pp. 32\u201333.</ref> Smith used the money he made from his job to buy blues records. The money also enabled him to study anthropology at the University of Washington in Seattle for five semesters between 1942 and the fall of 1944. He focused on American Indian tribes concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, making numerous field trips to document the music and customs of the [[Lummi]], whom he had gotten to know through his mother's work with them.<ref>Sanders, Liner Notes (2000) pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nWhen the war ended Smith, now 22, moved to the Bay Area of San Francisco, then home to a lively bohemian folk music and jazz scene. As a collector of blues records he had already been corresponding with the noted blues record aficionado James McKune, He now also began seriously collecting old hillbilly music records from junk dealers and stores which were going out of business and even appeared as a guest on a folk music radio show hosted by poet [[Jack Spicer]].<ref>Sanders, Liner Notes (2000), p. 9.</ref> In 1948, his mother succumbed to cancer.<ref name=\"Sanders, Liner Notes 2000 p. 14\">Sanders, Liner Notes (2000), p. 14.</ref> Immediately after her funeral, Smith, who was estranged from his father, left Berkeley for a room above a well known after-hours jazz club in the [[Fillmore District, San Francisco|Fillmore district]] of San Francisco. Smith was especially drawn to [[bebop]], a new jazz form which had originated during impromptu jam sessions before and after paid performances; and San Francisco abounded in night spots and after hours clubs where [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Charlie Parker]] could be heard. At this time he painted several ambitious jazz-inspired abstract paintings (since destroyed) and began making animated [[avant garde]] films featuring patterns that he painted directly on the film stock and which were intended to be shown to the accompaniment of bebop music.<ref>Sanders, Liner Notes (2000), p. 10.</ref>\n\nIn 1950 Smith received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim grant]] to complete an abstract film. This enabled him first to visit and later move to New York City.<ref>[http://www.harrysmitharchives.com/1_bio/index.html Biography of Harry Smith on Harry Smith Archives website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711145838/http://www.harrysmitharchives.com/1_bio/index.html |date=July 11, 2011 }}.</ref> He arranged for his collections, including his records, to be shipped to the East Coast. He said that \"one reason he moved to New York was to study the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]]. And, 'I wanted to hear [[Thelonious Monk]] play'.\"<ref>quoted in Sanders, Liner Notes (2000), p. 11.</ref> When his grant money ran out, he brought what he termed \"the cream of the crop\"<ref name=\"Sanders, Liner Notes 2000 p. 14\"/> of his record collection to [[Moe Asch]], president of [[Folkways Records]], with the idea of selling it. Instead, Asch proposed that the 27-year-old Smith use the material to edit a multi-volume anthology of American folk music in long playing format \u2013 then a newly developed, cutting edge medium \u2013 and he provided space and equipment in his office for Smith to work in. The recording engineer on the project was P\u00e9ter Bart\u00f3k, son of the renowned [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|composer and folklorist]].\n\n===Anthologist of American folk music===\nThe resultant [[Folkways Records|Folkways]] anthology, issued in 1952 under the title [[Anthology of American Folk Music|''American Folk Music'']], was a compilation of recordings of folk music issued on [[Old-time music|hillbilly]] and [[race record]]s that had previously been released commercially on 78 rpm. These dated from the abbreviated dawn, sometimes called the \"golden age\",<ref>[[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], Liner Notes to ''Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, Volume 4'' RVN 211 (2000) p. 40.</ref> of the commercial country music industry, that is, between 1927, when, as Smith explained, \"[[acoustic recording]] {{sic}}<ref>Technically, they were  [[Victor Orthophonic Victrola|\"electric recordings\"]], \"acoustic recordings\" were made by someone singing into a large trumpet, a practice that ended c. 1925.</ref> made possible accurate music reproduction, and 1932, when the [[Great Depression|Depression]] halted folk music sales\",<ref>Harry Smith, \"Foreword,\" to liner notes ''American Folk Music'', Folkways Records (1952).</ref> and the artists, in many cases, sunk into obscurity. Originally issued as budget discs marketed to regional, rural audiences, these records had long been known, collected, and occasionally reissued by folklorists<ref>For example, Ronald D. Cohen writes, \"John Lomax produced the [78 rpm] compilation album ''Smoky Mountain Ballads'' for RCA in 1941 [Victor P 79]. It included ten commercial recordings by [[Uncle Dave Macon]], the [[Carter Family]], Gil Tanner and his [[Skillet Lickers]], [[Bill Monroe]], and others [such as [[J. E. Mainer]]]. Alan would produce two similar compilations for Brunswick in 1947, ''Mountain Frolic'' and ''Listen to Our Story'',\" Ronald D. Cohen, editor, ''Alan Lomax Assistant in Charge: The Library of Congress Letters, 1935-1945'' (University of Mississippi Press, 2011) p. 390.</ref> and aficionados,<ref>\"Hillbilly reissues were learned and performed by revival performers such as Pete Seeger, who credited his sources and suggested that people should copy them, not him\", Neil V. Rosenberg, ''Bluegrass: A History'' (University of Illinois Press, 2005), p. 172.</ref> but this was the first time such a large compilation was made available to affluent, non-specialist urban dwellers. [[LP record|LP]] discs could hold much more material than the old three-minute 78s, and had greater fidelity and far less [[surface noise]]. The Anthology was packaged as a set of three, boxed albums with a total of 6 LPs. Each  box front a different color: red, blue, and green \u2013 in Smith's [[Schema (psychology)|schema]], representing the [[Alchemy|alchemical]] [[Classical element|elements]]. Priced at $25.00 per two-disc set, they were relatively expensive. For the money-challenged, Moe Asch maintained a retail record store in the 1950s near Union Square Park where he sold all 6 of the Anthology records for $1 each, as well as others from his catalogue. The $1 records were sold without their original jackets, and with a hole punched through the label area to indicate that the record was remaindered and not to be sold for the full retail price. A fourth album, comprising topical songs from the Depression era, was originally planned by [[Moe Asch|Asch]] and his long-time assistant, Marian Distler, and never completed by Smith. It was issued in 2000, nine years after his death in [[compact discs|CD]] format by [[Revenant Records]] with a 95-page booklet of tribute essays to Smith.<ref>Smith told [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], that there were to be \"four of them in the series.\" \"Red, Blue, Green [symbolizing Fire, Air and Water] were issued, so that the element that was left out was Earth. The type of thinking that I applied to records, I still apply to other things like Seminole patchwork, or to Ukrainian Easter eggs\" (Chelsea Hotel Interview, ''Sing Out!'' 4/5: 2\u20136 [1969], excerpted in Liner Notes to ''Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, Volume 4'', Revenant RVM 211 [2000], p. 33). In another interview, he said he had quarreled with Miss Distler over the song selection for the fourth volume (Interview conducted by Gary Kenton at the Breslin Hotel, NYC [1983], quoted in Liner Notes to ''Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, Volume 4'', Revenant RVM 211 [2000], p. 42).</ref>\n\nThe music on Smith's anthology, performed by such artists as [[Clarence Ashley]], [[Dock Boggs]], [[The Carter Family]], [[Sleepy John Estes]], [[Mississippi John Hurt]], [[Dick Justice (singer)|Dick Justice]], [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]], [[Buell Kazee]], and [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]], greatly influenced the [[folk & blues revival]]s of the 1950s and 60s and were covered by [[The New Lost City Ramblers]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Joan Baez]], to name a few. Rock critic [[Greil Marcus]] in his liner-note essay for the 1997 Smithsonian reissue, quoted musician [[Dave van Ronk]]'s avowal that \"We all knew every word of every song on it, including the ones we hated.\"<ref>Greil Marcus, \"The Old, Weird America,\" liner notes to ''Anthology of American Folk Music'' (1997 CD reissue), Smithsonian Folkways Recordings.</ref>\n\nSmith's presentation was a marked departure from the more social or politically oriented folk song collections of the 1930s and 40s. His annotations avoided localized historical and social commentary, consisting instead of terse, evocative synopses \u2013 riffs \u2013  written in the manner of telegraph messages or newspaper headlines as though from an otherworldly realm, seemingly both timeless and [[avant-garde]]. For example, for [[Chubby Parker]]'s rendition of \"King Kong Kitchie Kitchie Ki-Me-O\" (\"[[Frog Went A-Courting]]\"), a ballad that has been traced to 1548, Smith wrote: \"Zoologic Miscegeny Achieved Mouse Frog Nuptuals {{sic}}, Relatives Approve.\"\n\nSmith was also unique in associating folk music with the occult: the design he chose to be printed on the box covers, for example, was taken from an engraving by [[Theodore de Bry]] of a great hand tuning the Celestial [[monochord#Monochord practitioners|Monochord]] (the one-stringed instrument symbolizing the music of the spheres), that had illustrated a sixteenth-century treatise on music by the Elizabethan magus [[Robert Fludd]].<ref>So successful was Smith's mediation strategy in presenting these 1920s country artists as uncanny voices from the beyond \u2013 \"the old, weird America\", in Greil Marcus's memorable phrase \u2013 that the 1960s folk revivalists were astonished to find that many of these artists from forty years earlier were still very much alive.  \"What was then called \"old timey\" music ... at the time was about as far in the past as the Beatles are today,\" Peter Stampfel has observed. See [http://www.furious.com/perfect/harrysmith.html Peter Stampfel, \"Harry Smith Tribute, May. 1997\", ''Perfect Sound Forever Online Magazine''.] Thanks to Smith's Anthology, several of these performers subsequently went on to have revived musical careers.</ref>\n\nSmith told interviewer [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], that he had first heard this kind of record at the home of Bertrand Harris Bronson, the eminent English professor and ballad scholar,<ref>\"As a teacher [Bronson] had, as he liked to say, four quills in his quiver, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Johnson and his age, and the musicology of the ballad, and he had devoted students in each of these domains. They honored him by two ''festschriften'': ''The Ballad Image: Essays Presented to B. H. Bronson'', edited by James Porter, Center for Comparative Study of Folklore and Mythology, UCLA (1983); and ''Essays in Honor of B. H. Bronson'', edited by Robert Maccubbin and Oliver Sigworth, ''Eighteenth Century Life'' 10: 3.\" See [http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb767nb3z6&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00016&toc.depth=1&toc.id=  \"Bertrand H. Bronson (1903\u201386), Professor emeritus, English, University of California, Berkeley\".]</ref> who collected them. In 1946 Smith reportedly lived for a time in small room with a separate entrance on the first floor of Bronson's Berkeley residence, and it is thought he may have received informal tutelage in folk music through his acquaintance with the scholar.<ref>See Andrew Perchuk and Rani Singh, eds., ''Harry Smith: The Avant-Garde in the American Vernacular: Issues & Debates'' (Los Angeles: Getty Research Institute, 2010), pp. 22, 176\u201378.</ref>\n\nSmith also told Cohen that in selecting his material he relied heavily on the Library of Congress's mimeographed \"List of American Folk Songs on Commercial Records\", a monograph compiled by [[Alan Lomax]] in 1940 with the assistance of [[Pete Seeger]], that Lomax and Seeger had sent out to folk song scholars (and which could also be purchased directly from the Library for 25 cents).<ref>See John Swzed, ''Alan Lomax, The Man Who Recorded the World'' (New York, London: Viking, 2011), pp. 223\u201324. Nathan Salsburg writes:<blockquote>Of the estimated (by Szwed) 3000 titles Lomax and Seeger listened to, Alan selected 350 for inclusion in a Library of Congress monograph called the \"List of American Folk Songs on Commercial Records,\" published in a September 1940 Report of the Committee of the Conference on Inter-American Relations in the Field of Music. This was the first methodological research made into the pre-war commercial record companies' documentation of rural vernacular music and, despite its main shortcoming \u2014 the fact that the team had little or no access to titles from the Gennett or OKeh catalogs \u2014 it proved to be a highly influential road-map for at least two of the earliest and most influential collectors of this music, Harry Smith and James McKune, who in turn paved the way for the many years that followed of its further excavation, investigation, and publication \u2014 which, of course, continue apace today ([http://roothogordie.wordpress.com/2012/09/24/alan-lomaxs-list-of-american-folk-songs-on-commercial-records/ Nathan Salsburg, \"Alan Lomax's, 'List of American Folk Songs on Commercial Records', Library of Congress, 1940\", ''Root Hog or Die'', September 24, 2012.])</blockquote></ref> \nCohen asked Smith: \"Where did you first hear of the Carter Family?\"\n\n{{quote|'''Smith:''' I would think from that mimeographed list that the Library of Congress issued around 1937 {{sic}}, \"American Folksongs on Commercially Available Records\" {{sic}}. Shortly after that, two Carter Family recordings, \"Worried Man Blues\" and \"East Virginia Blues\" were reissued on the album ''Smoky Mountain Ballads''. That album would come to stores that wouldn't ordinarily have Carter Family records.\n\n'''John Cohen:''' In that album John and Alan Lomax made hillbilly music respectable enough to have it sold along with art music and symphonies.<ref>\"A Rare Interview with Harry Smith\", ''Sing Out!'' 4/5 (1969): 2\u20136.</ref>}}\n\nTwelve of the 60 songs and many of the artists on Lomax and Seeger's \"List\" appear in Smith's anthology and his notes credit the Lomaxes. Smith explained that he had selected material based on what he thought would be of interest to scholars and to people who might like to sing them.<ref>\"You couldn't get a representative cross-section of music into such a small number of records [six LPs]. Instead, they were selected to be ones that would be popular among musicologists, or possibly with people who would want to sing them and maybe would improve the version. They were basically picked out from an epistemological, musicological selection of reasons\" ([[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], Chelsea Hotel Interview, [\"A Rare Interview with Harry Smith\", ''Sing Out!'' 4/5 (1969): 2\u20136]). However, Smith also insisted that in deciding what to put in and what to leave out, \"The first criterion was excellence in performance, combined with excellence of words.\" (John Cohen, \"A Rare Interview With Harry Smith\", ''Sing Out!'' 4/5: 2\u20136).</ref> He also told Cohen that, \"I felt social change would result from it. I'd been reading [[The Republic (Plato)|Plato's Republic]]. He's jabbering about music, how you have to be careful about changing the music, because it might upset or destroy the government. Everybody gets out of step. You are not to arbitrarily change it because you may undermine the Empire State Building without knowing it. Of course, I thought it would do that ... I imagined it as having some kind of social force for good\".<ref>John Cohen, \"A Rare Interview With Harry Smith\", Sing Out! 4/5: 2\u20136</ref>\n\nIn 1991, shortly before his death, Smith was the recipient of a [[Grammy]], the Chairman's Merit Award for Lifetime Achievement. Ed Sanders writes:\n\n<blockquote>It was a joy to his many friends to see him clambering up the Grammy steps wearing a tuxedo. \"I'm glad to say that my dreams came true \u2013 I saw America changed through music,\" he told the audience. Plato was right, music can change the direction of a civilization, for worse or better.<ref>Sanders, Liner Notes [2000], p. 30).</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1997, Smith's collection was re-released as a boxed set of six [[compact discs|CDs]] on [[Folkways Records|Smithsonian Folkways Recordings]], as the ''Anthology of American Folk Music'' (now also informally referred to as \"The Harry Smith Anthology\").\n\nIn his notes to a 2006 revival CD, [[Elvis Costello]] wrote: \"We're lucky that somebody compiled the ''Anthology'' as intelligently and as imaginatively so that it can tell a series of stories to future musicians and listeners, and be a starting point.\"<ref>Elvis Costello, Liner Note to  ''The Harry Smith Project: The Anthology of American Folk Music Revisited'', Sony BMG Music Entertainment CD (2006).</ref>\n\n===Other recording projects===\nIn addition to compiling the Folkways anthology, Smith was also instrumental in getting Folkways to produce ''[[The Fugs First Album]]'', now considered{{by whom|date=August 2017}} the first \"folk rock\" album, on its Broadside label in 1965. A regular visitor to the Peace Eye bookstore, in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] on 10th Street between Avenues B and Ave C, founded in 1965 by poet [[Ed Sanders]], Smith had advised Sanders which books about Native American studies the store ought to stock. When Sanders and [[Tuli Kupferberg]] formed the [[The Fugs|Fugs]], they rehearsed at Peace Eye. \"Thanks to Harry,\" writes Sanders, \"the band was able to record an album within weeks of forming.\"<ref>Sanders, Liner Notes (2000), p. 21.</ref> Peter Stampfel recalled that, as the album's editor and producer, \"Harry's contribution to the proceedings were his presence, inspiration, and best of all, smashing a wine bottle against the wall while we were recording 'Nothing,'\"<ref>[http://www.furious.com/perfect/harrysmith.html Peter Stampfel, \"Harry Smith Tribute, May. 1997\", ''Perfect Sound Forever Online Magazine''.]</ref> But Sanders recalled learning a lot from watching Smith's adept, businesslike tape editing at the Folkways studio, adding that, as far as he knew, Smith received no financial reward for his work. He asked for a bottle of rum, which Sanders bought for him, and then proceeded to smash the bottle against the wall, to \"spur us to greater motivity and energy\", Sanders speculated.<ref>Ed Sanders, ''Fug You: An Informal History of the Peace Eye Bookstore, the Fuck You Press, the Fugs, and Counterculture in the Lower East Side'' (Philadelphia, Pa.: Da Capo Press, 2011), p. 142.</ref>\n\nIn 1971\u201373 Smith recorded performances held at his room at the [[Hotel Chelsea]] (for a project called \"deonage\") of, among other things, spontaneously composed folk and protest songs written and performed by his long-time friend, [[Allen Ginsberg]], accompanying himself on the [[Pump organ|harmonium]]. These included, \"CIA Dope Calypso\", \"MacDougal Street Blues\", \"Bus Ride Ballad Ride to Suva\", and \"Dope Fiend Blues\", among others, all later issued on an LP entitled ''New York Blues: Rags, Ballads and Harmonium Songs'' (Folkways, 1981).\n\nIn keeping with his interest in chemically altered states of consciousness, Smith made field recordings documenting Kiowa peyote meeting songs, which Folkways issued as a multi-LP set.\n\n===Experimental films===\nCritical attention has been most often paid to Smith's [[experimental film|experimental work with film]].

He frequently reedited them (hence the different runtimes), incorporating on various occasions reassembled footage of different film to be viewed with varying music tracks. For instance, the handmade films now known as No. 1, 2, 3, and 5 were accompanied by an improvising jazz band on May 12, 1950 when they premiered as part of the ''Art in Cinema'' series curated by Smith's friend [[Frank Stauffacher]] at the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art|San Francisco Museum of Art]], though Smith had originally intended them to be accompanied by recordings of beat favorite [[Dizzy Gillespie]]. Later he showed the films with random records or even the radio as accompaniment. Smith stated that his films were made for contemporary music, and he kept changing their soundtracks. At the urging of his friend Rosemarie \"Rosebud\" Feliu-Pettet, Smith also re-cut ''[[Early Abstractions]]'' to sync with ''[[Meet the Beatles!]]''. After Smith's death, artists such as [[John Zorn]], [[Philip Glass]] or [[DJ Spooky]] provided musical backgrounds for screenings of his films: Zorn at many screenings at [[Anthology Film Archives]] (where he is composer-in-residence) as part of his Essential Cinema project, Glass at the 2004 summer benefit concert of [[the Film-Makers' Cooperative]] and DJ Spooky at several venues in 1999 for ''Harry Smith: A Re-creation'', an embroidered compendium of Smith's films put together by his close collaborator M. Henry Jones who tries to screen the films in the manner intended by Smith - as performances - using stroboscopic effects, multiple projections, magic lanterns, and the like.<ref>[http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/VMFilms.htm Center for Visual Music], [http://www.film-makerscoop.com/benefit.html The Film-Makers' Cooperative], [http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74669 Chris Baker: A Waking Dream] ([[Austin Chronicle]]), [http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=4689 Ain't It Cool News)], [http://citypages.com/databank/20/958/article7464.asp Reconstructing Harry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050911022222/http://www.citypages.com/databank/20/958/article7464.asp |date=September 11, 2005 }} ([[City Pages]]).</ref>\n\nThe present-day numbering system which Smith introduced some time between 1951 and 1964\u201365 (the year [[the Film-Makers' Cooperative]] started distributing 16&nbsp;mm copies of his films) includes only films that survived up to that point. Thus this filmography is in no way a comprehensive list of all the films he has ever made, all the more as he is known to have lost, sold, traded or even wantonly destroyed some of his own works. The dating of the film presents another puzzle. Since Smith frequently worked for years on them and kept little to no documentation, the information varies considerably from one source to another. Therefore all available information has been added to the following list, inevitably resulting in a loss of clarity but having the advantage of giving the whole picture. The films are also known by variant designation, i.e. ''Film No. 1'', ''Film # 1'' or simply ''# 1''.\n\nSince the 1970s Smith's films have been archived and preserved at [[Anthology Film Archives]] in New York City.\n\nThe Academy Film Archive preserved \"Abstractions,\" films 1-3, and \"Freedom and Famine\" by Harry Smith.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=&filmmaker=harry+smith&category=All&collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\n===Visual art===\nSmith's early efforts in the field of [[fine art]] painting were [[:wikt:freeform|freeform]] [[abstraction]]s intended to visually represent notes, measures, [[Beat (music)|beats]] and [[riff]]s of the [[beatnik|beatnik era]] [[jazz music]] that [[muse|inspired]] him.\n\nThere is photographic evidence of Smith's large paintings created in the 1940s; however, the works themselves were destroyed by Smith himself. He did not destroy his work on film (although he did misplace a few) and this legacy supplements the nature and design of his paintings. Smith created several later works, some of which have been serially printed in limited editions. Much of his imagery is inspired by [[Hermetic Qabalah|Kabbalistic]] themes such as the [[Sephirah]], where the [[Planetary spheres|Planetary Spheres]] are distributed like musical notes upon a staff.\n\n===Occult interests===\nSmith said he had become acquainted with the [[Lummi]] Indians through his mother's teaching work and claimed to have participated in [[shaman|shamanic initiation]] at a young age. He recorded Lummi songs and rituals using homemade equipment and notation of his own devising and developed an important collection of Native American religious objects.\n\nTarot cards were another of Smith's interests. A set of \"irregularly-shaped Tarot cards\" he designed was apparently used for the degree certificates for a branch of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] founded by occult \"magus\" [[Aleister Crowley]].<ref name=\"Sanders, Liner Notes 2000 p. 24\">Sanders, Liner Notes (2000), p. 24.</ref> In the late 1940s in California Smith is said to have worked with the reputed occult \"magus\" Aleister Crowley's one-time acolyte [[Charles Stansfeld Jones]],{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} a convert to Roman Catholicism, and later with Jones's \"trusted student\", Albert Handel<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=j3uVfRl9kWEC&pg=PR30&dq=albert+handel&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1qiTUqn0HtHKsQT5soDwBQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=albert%20handel&f=false Albert Handel]</ref> in New York.\n\nSmith frequented the [[Weiser Antiquarian Books|Samuel Weiser Antiquarian Bookstore]], a used book store on New York's \"Book Row\" that specialized in works on [[comparative religion]], [[hermeticism]], and the [[occult]]. The store also had a publishing house, Weiser Books, which used Smith's designs for its paperback edition of Aleister Crowley's ''[[Holy Books of Thelema]]''.<ref name=\"Sanders, Liner Notes 2000 p. 24\"/>\n\n[[Ed Sanders|Sanders]] recounts that Smith was the key advisor for [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[The Fugs]] 's effort to levitate [[The Pentagon]]. \"In the fall of 1967,\" he wrote:\n\n<blockquote> a bunch of us decided to exorcise the demons from the Pentagon as part of a big demonstration against the Vietnam War. (You can get a flavor of that day from [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[Armies of the Night]]''.) I was in charge of coming up with a structure for the Exorcism. I knew Harry would know what to do so I conferred with him. He gave me the basic outline, which was to use the symbols of the four directions, and to use the symbols of earth, air, fire, and water. He also suggested adding a cow, to represent the Goddess Hathor. We did have a cow prepared, painted with mythic symbols, but the police stopped it from getting near the Pentagon. The Exorcism was duly recorded by WBAI's Bob Fass, and can be found on the Fugs album ''Tenderness Junction''.<ref name=\"Sanders, Liner Notes 2000 p. 24\"/></blockquote>\n\nSmith also studied the [[Enochian magic|Enochian]] system in depth and as it was recounted by [[Edward Kelley]] and [[John Dee]], and as later elaborated upon by the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]]. He also compiled a concordance of the Enochian language with the aid of Khem Caigan, his assistant throughout much of the 1970s and early 1980s.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nIn 1986 Smith was consecrated a bishop in the [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]], which claims [[William Blake]] and [[Giordano Bruno]] in its pantheon of saints. Smith had long been a familiar figure in the New York branch of [[Ordo Templi Orientis]]. After his death, Smith's branch of the sect performed a Gnostic Mass in his honor at St. Mark's Church in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].<ref name=\"Sanders, Liner Notes 2000 p. 24\"/>\n\n===Later life and death===\nSmith lived at the [[Hotel Chelsea]] on West 23rd Street in New York City, residing in Room #731 from 1968 to 1977, after which he was \"sometimes 'stranded' at hotels where he would owe so much money he couldn't leave, and he was too famous just to be thrown out\".<ref>Sanders, Liner Notes (2000) p. 26</ref> This was the case at the Breslin Hotel at 28th and Broadway, where Smith lived until 1985, when his friend, poet Allen Ginsberg, took him into his home on East 12th Street. While living with Ginsberg, Smith designed the cover for two of Ginsberg's books, ''White Shroud'' and ''Collected Poems'', as well as continuing to work on his own films and to record ambient sounds. For many years subsisting on a diet of raw eggs, vodka and amphetamine tablets{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}, by this time, Smith was suffering from severe health and dental problems.  He proved a difficult guest. Ginsberg's psychiatrist finally told him that Smith would have to leave because he was bad for Ginsberg's blood pressure (Ginsberg was already suffering from the cardiovascular disease that was to kill him). In 1988 Ginsberg arranged for Smith to teach shamanism at the Naropa Institute (now [[Naropa University]]) in Boulder, Colorado. When Ginsberg, who was paying all of Smith's expenses, realized Smith was using the money he was sending him for rent to buy alcohol, he hired Rani Singh, then a student at Naropa, to look after him, but not before Smith had amassed substantial debts that Ginsberg would be responsible for.<ref>Bill Morgan, ''I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg'' (Viking Group, 2006), p. 607.</ref> Singh, now an author and art curator, has since devoted much of her life to furthering Smith's legacy.\n\nSmith returned to New York, staying for a while with friends in Cooperstown, New York, and ending up at one point at Francis House, a home for derelicts on the Bowery. All the while he continued to tape ambient sounds, including \"the dying coughs and prayers of impoverished sick people in adjacent cubicles.\"<ref>Allen Ginsberg quoted in Sanders, Liner Notes (2000) p. 29</ref>\n\nIn November 1991, Smith suffered a bleeding ulcer followed by cardiac arrest in Room 328 at the [[Hotel Chelsea]] in [[New York City]]. His friend, poet [[Paola Igliori]], described him as dying in her arms, \"singing as he drifted away\".<ref>[http://blogs.indiewire.com/pressplay/grey_matters_remembering_lance_loud \"Grey Matters: Young and old memories of the Hotel Chelsea\"] by Ian Grey, ''[[indieWire|Indie Wire]]'', 12 August 2011</ref> Smith was pronounced dead one hour later at [[St. Vincent's Hospital (Manhattan)|St. Vincent's Hospital]].\n\nSmith's ashes are in the care of his friend, longtime participant in New York's [[Beat Generation|Beat]] scene, Rosemarie \"Rosebud\" Feliu-Pettet, whom Paola Igliori has described as Smith's \"spiritual wife.\"<ref name=allen>[http://www.allenginsberg.org/index.php?page=paola-igliori-interview-on-harry-smith Allen Ginsberg & Paola Igliori, 24 September 1995], at the AllenGinsberg.org</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n*''[[Early Abstractions]]'' (1939-56 or 1941-57 or 1946-52 or 1946-57) (assembled ca. 1964) 16&nbsp;mm, black & white and color, 22 min.

Smith was an important figure in the [[Beat Generation]] scene in New York City, and his activities, such as his use of mind-altering substances and interest in [[Esotericism|esoteric]] [[spirituality]], anticipated aspects of the [[History of the hippie movement|Hippie movement]]. Besides his films, most notably his full length [[Cutout animation|cutout animated]] film ''[[Heaven and Earth Magic]]'' (1962), Smith is also widely known for his influential ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music]]'', drawn from his extensive collection of out-of-print commercial 78 rpm recordings.\n\nThroughout his life Smith was an inveterate collector. In addition to records, artifacts he collected included [[string figure]]s,<ref>A brochure accompanying an exhibit of Harry Smith's string figures stated: \"First described in Western anthropological literature by [[Franz Boas]] in 1888, these patterns \u2013 made by looping or weaving lengths of string into geometric forms or shapes that often evoke familiar objects \u2013 have been produced throughout history, both as a secular pastime and as a spiritual practice. When he died, Smith left an unfinished thousand-page manuscript on string figures, along with an extensive collection of figures that he had created\", [http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/harry-smith-string-figures/ \"Harry Smith: String Figures\", Cabinet Gallery, Brooklyn, N.Y. (September 19 through November 3, 2012)]</ref> [[paper airplanes]], [[Seminole textiles]], and [[Ukrainian Easter eggs]].\n\n==Biography==\nHarry Smith was born in Portland, Oregon, and spent his earliest years in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] in the area between [[Seattle]] and [[Bellingham]]. As a child he lived for a time with his family in [[Anacortes, Washington]], a town on [[Fidalgo Island]], where the [[Swinomish Reservation of Washington#Reservation|Swinomish Indian reservation]] is located.<ref>[[Ed Sanders]], biographical essay in Liner Notes to ''Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, Volume 4'', Revenant RVM 211 (2000), pp. 4\u20135.</ref> He attended high school in nearby [[Bellingham]].\n\nSmith's parents were [[Theosophism|Theosophists]] with [[Pantheism|Pantheistic]] tendencies (involving the belief in an immanent God who is identical with the Universe or nature), and both were fond of folk music. His mother, Mary Louise, originally from Sioux City, Iowa, came from a long line of school teachers and herself taught for a time on the [[Lummi]] Indian reservation near Bellingham. His father, Robert James Smith, a fisherman, worked as a watchman for the Pacific American Fishery, a salmon canning company. Smith's paternal great-grandfather John Corson Smith (d. 1910) had been a Union colonel in the [[American Civil War]], brevetted Brigadier General just as the war ended, and had served from 1885-89 as Lieutenant Governor of the state of Illinois. He had also been a prominent [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and had authored several books about the history of the order.<ref>[http://galenahistory.blogspot.com/2011/12/meet-generals-john-corson-smith.html \"Meet the Generals: John Corson Smith\"], Galena [Illinois] History (December, 2011).</ref>\n\nSmith's parents, who didn't get along, lived in separate houses, meeting only at dinner time. Although poor, they gave their son an artistic education, including 10 years of drawing and painting lessons. For a time, it is said, they even ran an art school in their house. Smith was also a voracious reader and he recalled his father bringing him a copy of [[Carl Sandburg]]'s folksong anthology, ''American Songbag''. \"We were considered some kind of 'low' family\", Smith once said, \"despite my mother's feeling that she was [an incarnation of] the Czarina of Russia\".<ref>[[Ed Sanders]], Liner Notes (2000), pp. 4\u20135.</ref> Friends recall that in high school Smith carried around a camera and in his high school yearbook said that he wanted to compose symphonic music.\n\nPhysically, Smith was undersized and had a curvature of the spine which kept him from being drafted (a circumstance that later would disqualify him from benefitting from the G.I. Bill). During World War II he took a job as a mechanic working nights on the construction of the tight, hard-to-reach interior of Boeing bomber planes, for which his short stature suited him.<ref>John Cohen wrote: \"Moe [Asch] first told me about Harry Smith, the man: that Smith was a little oddball guy \u2013 something of a hunchback \u2013 who had amassed his collection of 78 rpm records on the West Coast, and paid for it with his job working in the tight parts of World War II bombers.\" John Cohen in Liner Notes to ''Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, Volume 4'', Revenant RVM 211 (2000), pp. 32\u201333.</ref> Smith used the money he made from his job to buy blues records. The money also enabled him to study anthropology at the University of Washington in Seattle for five semesters between 1942 and the fall of 1944. He focused on American Indian tribes concentrated in the Pacific Northwest, making numerous field trips to document the music and customs of the [[Lummi]], whom he had gotten to know through his mother's work with them.<ref>Sanders, Liner Notes (2000) pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\nWhen the war ended Smith, now 22, moved to the Bay Area of San Francisco, then home to a lively bohemian folk music and jazz scene. As a collector of blues records he had already been corresponding with the noted blues record aficionado James McKune, He now also began seriously collecting old hillbilly music records from junk dealers and stores which were going out of business and even appeared as a guest on a folk music radio show hosted by poet [[Jack Spicer]].<ref>Sanders, Liner Notes (2000), p. 9.</ref> In 1948, his mother succumbed to cancer.<ref name=\"Sanders, Liner Notes 2000 p. 14\">Sanders, Liner Notes (2000), p. 14.</ref> Immediately after her funeral, Smith, who was estranged from his father, left Berkeley for a room above a well known after-hours jazz club in the [[Fillmore District, San Francisco|Fillmore district]] of San Francisco. Smith was especially drawn to [[bebop]], a new jazz form which had originated during impromptu jam sessions before and after paid performances; and San Francisco abounded in night spots and after hours clubs where [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and [[Charlie Parker]] could be heard. At this time he painted several ambitious jazz-inspired abstract paintings (since destroyed) and began making animated [[avant garde]] films featuring patterns that he painted directly on the film stock and which were intended to be shown to the accompaniment of bebop music.<ref>Sanders, Liner Notes (2000), p. 10.</ref>\n\nIn 1950 Smith received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim grant]] to complete an abstract film. This enabled him first to visit and later move to New York City.<ref>[http://www.harrysmitharchives.com/1_bio/index.html Biography of Harry Smith on Harry Smith Archives website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711145838/http://www.harrysmitharchives.com/1_bio/index.html |date=July 11, 2011 }}.</ref> He arranged for his collections, including his records, to be shipped to the East Coast. He said that \"one reason he moved to New York was to study the [[Kabbalah|Cabala]]. And, 'I wanted to hear [[Thelonious Monk]] play'.\"<ref>quoted in Sanders, Liner Notes (2000), p. 11.</ref> When his grant money ran out, he brought what he termed \"the cream of the crop\"<ref name=\"Sanders, Liner Notes 2000 p. 14\"/> of his record collection to [[Moe Asch]], president of [[Folkways Records]], with the idea of selling it. Instead, Asch proposed that the 27-year-old Smith use the material to edit a multi-volume anthology of American folk music in long playing format \u2013 then a newly developed, cutting edge medium \u2013 and he provided space and equipment in his office for Smith to work in. The recording engineer on the project was P\u00e9ter Bart\u00f3k, son of the renowned [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|composer and folklorist]].\n\n===Anthologist of American folk music===\nThe resultant [[Folkways Records|Folkways]] anthology, issued in 1952 under the title [[Anthology of American Folk Music|''American Folk Music'']], was a compilation of recordings of folk music issued on [[Old-time music|hillbilly]] and [[race record]]s that had previously been released commercially on 78 rpm. These dated from the abbreviated dawn, sometimes called the \"golden age\",<ref>[[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], Liner Notes to ''Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, Volume 4'' RVN 211 (2000) p. 40.</ref> of the commercial country music industry, that is, between 1927, when, as Smith explained, \"[[acoustic recording]] {{sic}}<ref>Technically, they were  [[Victor Orthophonic Victrola|\"electric recordings\"]], \"acoustic recordings\" were made by someone singing into a large trumpet, a practice that ended c. 1925.</ref> made possible accurate music reproduction, and 1932, when the [[Great Depression|Depression]] halted folk music sales\",<ref>Harry Smith, \"Foreword,\" to liner notes ''American Folk Music'', Folkways Records (1952).</ref> and the artists, in many cases, sunk into obscurity. Originally issued as budget discs marketed to regional, rural audiences, these records had long been known, collected, and occasionally reissued by folklorists<ref>For example, Ronald D. Cohen writes, \"John Lomax produced the [78 rpm] compilation album ''Smoky Mountain Ballads'' for RCA in 1941 [Victor P 79]. It included ten commercial recordings by [[Uncle Dave Macon]], the [[Carter Family]], Gil Tanner and his [[Skillet Lickers]], [[Bill Monroe]], and others [such as [[J. E. Mainer]]]. Alan would produce two similar compilations for Brunswick in 1947, ''Mountain Frolic'' and ''Listen to Our Story'',\" Ronald D. Cohen, editor, ''Alan Lomax Assistant in Charge: The Library of Congress Letters, 1935-1945'' (University of Mississippi Press, 2011) p. 390.</ref> and aficionados,<ref>\"Hillbilly reissues were learned and performed by revival performers such as Pete Seeger, who credited his sources and suggested that people should copy them, not him\", Neil V. Rosenberg, ''Bluegrass: A History'' (University of Illinois Press, 2005), p. 172.</ref> but this was the first time such a large compilation was made available to affluent, non-specialist urban dwellers. [[LP record|LP]] discs could hold much more material than the old three-minute 78s, and had greater fidelity and far less [[surface noise]]. The Anthology was packaged as a set of three, boxed albums with a total of 6 LPs. Each  box front a different color: red, blue, and green \u2013 in Smith's [[Schema (psychology)|schema]], representing the [[Alchemy|alchemical]] [[Classical element|elements]]. Priced at $25.00 per two-disc set, they were relatively expensive. For the money-challenged, Moe Asch maintained a retail record store in the 1950s near Union Square Park where he sold all 6 of the Anthology records for $1 each, as well as others from his catalogue. The $1 records were sold without their original jackets, and with a hole punched through the label area to indicate that the record was remaindered and not to be sold for the full retail price. A fourth album, comprising topical songs from the Depression era, was originally planned by [[Moe Asch|Asch]] and his long-time assistant, Marian Distler, and never completed by Smith. It was issued in 2000, nine years after his death in [[compact discs|CD]] format by [[Revenant Records]] with a 95-page booklet of tribute essays to Smith.<ref>Smith told [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], that there were to be \"four of them in the series.\" \"Red, Blue, Green [symbolizing Fire, Air and Water] were issued, so that the element that was left out was Earth. The type of thinking that I applied to records, I still apply to other things like Seminole patchwork, or to Ukrainian Easter eggs\" (Chelsea Hotel Interview, ''Sing Out!'' 4/5: 2\u20136 [1969], excerpted in Liner Notes to ''Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, Volume 4'', Revenant RVM 211 [2000], p. 33). In another interview, he said he had quarreled with Miss Distler over the song selection for the fourth volume (Interview conducted by Gary Kenton at the Breslin Hotel, NYC [1983], quoted in Liner Notes to ''Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, Volume 4'', Revenant RVM 211 [2000], p. 42).</ref>\n\nThe music on Smith's anthology, performed by such artists as [[Clarence Ashley]], [[Dock Boggs]], [[The Carter Family]], [[Sleepy John Estes]], [[Mississippi John Hurt]], [[Dick Justice (singer)|Dick Justice]], [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]], [[Buell Kazee]], and [[Bascom Lamar Lunsford]], greatly influenced the [[folk & blues revival]]s of the 1950s and 60s and were covered by [[The New Lost City Ramblers]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Joan Baez]], to name a few. Rock critic [[Greil Marcus]] in his liner-note essay for the 1997 Smithsonian reissue, quoted musician [[Dave van Ronk]]'s avowal that \"We all knew every word of every song on it, including the ones we hated.\"<ref>Greil Marcus, \"The Old, Weird America,\" liner notes to ''Anthology of American Folk Music'' (1997 CD reissue), Smithsonian Folkways Recordings.</ref>\n\nSmith's presentation was a marked departure from the more social or politically oriented folk song collections of the 1930s and 40s. His annotations avoided localized historical and social commentary, consisting instead of terse, evocative synopses \u2013 riffs \u2013  written in the manner of telegraph messages or newspaper headlines as though from an otherworldly realm, seemingly both timeless and [[avant-garde]]. For example, for [[Chubby Parker]]'s rendition of \"King Kong Kitchie Kitchie Ki-Me-O\" (\"[[Frog Went A-Courting]]\"), a ballad that has been traced to 1548, Smith wrote: \"Zoologic Miscegeny Achieved Mouse Frog Nuptuals {{sic}}, Relatives Approve.\"\n\nSmith was also unique in associating folk music with the occult: the design he chose to be printed on the box covers, for example, was taken from an engraving by [[Theodore de Bry]] of a great hand tuning the Celestial [[monochord#Monochord practitioners|Monochord]] (the one-stringed instrument symbolizing the music of the spheres), that had illustrated a sixteenth-century treatise on music by the Elizabethan magus [[Robert Fludd]].<ref>So successful was Smith's mediation strategy in presenting these 1920s country artists as uncanny voices from the beyond \u2013 \"the old, weird America\", in Greil Marcus's memorable phrase \u2013 that the 1960s folk revivalists were astonished to find that many of these artists from forty years earlier were still very much alive.  \"What was then called \"old timey\" music ... at the time was about as far in the past as the Beatles are today,\" Peter Stampfel has observed. See [http://www.furious.com/perfect/harrysmith.html Peter Stampfel, \"Harry Smith Tribute, May. 1997\", ''Perfect Sound Forever Online Magazine''.] Thanks to Smith's Anthology, several of these performers subsequently went on to have revived musical careers.</ref>\n\nSmith told interviewer [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], that he had first heard this kind of record at the home of Bertrand Harris Bronson, the eminent English professor and ballad scholar,<ref>\"As a teacher [Bronson] had, as he liked to say, four quills in his quiver, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Johnson and his age, and the musicology of the ballad, and he had devoted students in each of these domains. They honored him by two ''festschriften'': ''The Ballad Image: Essays Presented to B. H. Bronson'', edited by James Porter, Center for Comparative Study of Folklore and Mythology, UCLA (1983); and ''Essays in Honor of B. H. Bronson'', edited by Robert Maccubbin and Oliver Sigworth, ''Eighteenth Century Life'' 10: 3.\" See [http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb767nb3z6&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00016&toc.depth=1&toc.id=  \"Bertrand H. Bronson (1903\u201386), Professor emeritus, English, University of California, Berkeley\".]</ref> who collected them. In 1946 Smith reportedly lived for a time in small room with a separate entrance on the first floor of Bronson's Berkeley residence, and it is thought he may have received informal tutelage in folk music through his acquaintance with the scholar.<ref>See Andrew Perchuk and Rani Singh, eds., ''Harry Smith: The Avant-Garde in the American Vernacular: Issues & Debates'' (Los Angeles: Getty Research Institute, 2010), pp. 22, 176\u201378.</ref>\n\nSmith also told Cohen that in selecting his material he relied heavily on the Library of Congress's mimeographed \"List of American Folk Songs on Commercial Records\", a monograph compiled by [[Alan Lomax]] in 1940 with the assistance of [[Pete Seeger]], that Lomax and Seeger had sent out to folk song scholars (and which could also be purchased directly from the Library for 25 cents).<ref>See John Swzed, ''Alan Lomax, The Man Who Recorded the World'' (New York, London: Viking, 2011), pp. 223\u201324. Nathan Salsburg writes:<blockquote>Of the estimated (by Szwed) 3000 titles Lomax and Seeger listened to, Alan selected 350 for inclusion in a Library of Congress monograph called the \"List of American Folk Songs on Commercial Records,\" published in a September 1940 Report of the Committee of the Conference on Inter-American Relations in the Field of Music. This was the first methodological research made into the pre-war commercial record companies' documentation of rural vernacular music and, despite its main shortcoming \u2014 the fact that the team had little or no access to titles from the Gennett or OKeh catalogs \u2014 it proved to be a highly influential road-map for at least two of the earliest and most influential collectors of this music, Harry Smith and James McKune, who in turn paved the way for the many years that followed of its further excavation, investigation, and publication \u2014 which, of course, continue apace today ([http://roothogordie.wordpress.com/2012/09/24/alan-lomaxs-list-of-american-folk-songs-on-commercial-records/ Nathan Salsburg, \"Alan Lomax's, 'List of American Folk Songs on Commercial Records', Library of Congress, 1940\", ''Root Hog or Die'', September 24, 2012.])</blockquote></ref> \nCohen asked Smith: \"Where did you first hear of the Carter Family?\"\n\n{{quote|'''Smith:''' I would think from that mimeographed list that the Library of Congress issued around 1937 {{sic}}, \"American Folksongs on Commercially Available Records\" {{sic}}. Shortly after that, two Carter Family recordings, \"Worried Man Blues\" and \"East Virginia Blues\" were reissued on the album ''Smoky Mountain Ballads''. That album would come to stores that wouldn't ordinarily have Carter Family records.\n\n'''John Cohen:''' In that album John and Alan Lomax made hillbilly music respectable enough to have it sold along with art music and symphonies.<ref>\"A Rare Interview with Harry Smith\", ''Sing Out!'' 4/5 (1969): 2\u20136.</ref>}}\n\nTwelve of the 60 songs and many of the artists on Lomax and Seeger's \"List\" appear in Smith's anthology and his notes credit the Lomaxes. Smith explained that he had selected material based on what he thought would be of interest to scholars and to people who might like to sing them.<ref>\"You couldn't get a representative cross-section of music into such a small number of records [six LPs]. Instead, they were selected to be ones that would be popular among musicologists, or possibly with people who would want to sing them and maybe would improve the version. They were basically picked out from an epistemological, musicological selection of reasons\" ([[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], Chelsea Hotel Interview, [\"A Rare Interview with Harry Smith\", ''Sing Out!'' 4/5 (1969): 2\u20136]). However, Smith also insisted that in deciding what to put in and what to leave out, \"The first criterion was excellence in performance, combined with excellence of words.\" (John Cohen, \"A Rare Interview With Harry Smith\", ''Sing Out!'' 4/5: 2\u20136).</ref> He also told Cohen that, \"I felt social change would result from it. I'd been reading [[The Republic (Plato)|Plato's Republic]]. He's jabbering about music, how you have to be careful about changing the music, because it might upset or destroy the government. Everybody gets out of step. You are not to arbitrarily change it because you may undermine the Empire State Building without knowing it. Of course, I thought it would do that ... I imagined it as having some kind of social force for good\".<ref>John Cohen, \"A Rare Interview With Harry Smith\", Sing Out! 4/5: 2\u20136</ref>\n\nIn 1991, shortly before his death, Smith was the recipient of a [[Grammy]], the Chairman's Merit Award for Lifetime Achievement. Ed Sanders writes:\n\n<blockquote>It was a joy to his many friends to see him clambering up the Grammy steps wearing a tuxedo. \"I'm glad to say that my dreams came true \u2013 I saw America changed through music,\" he told the audience. Plato was right, music can change the direction of a civilization, for worse or better.<ref>Sanders, Liner Notes [2000], p. 30).</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1997, Smith's collection was re-released as a boxed set of six [[compact discs|CDs]] on [[Folkways Records|Smithsonian Folkways Recordings]], as the ''Anthology of American Folk Music'' (now also informally referred to as \"The Harry Smith Anthology\").\n\nIn his notes to a 2006 revival CD, [[Elvis Costello]] wrote: \"We're lucky that somebody compiled the ''Anthology'' as intelligently and as imaginatively so that it can tell a series of stories to future musicians and listeners, and be a starting point.\"<ref>Elvis Costello, Liner Note to  ''The Harry Smith Project: The Anthology of American Folk Music Revisited'', Sony BMG Music Entertainment CD (2006).</ref>\n\n===Other recording projects===\nIn addition to compiling the Folkways anthology, Smith was also instrumental in getting Folkways to produce ''[[The Fugs First Album]]'', now considered{{by whom|date=August 2017}} the first \"folk rock\" album, on its Broadside label in 1965. A regular visitor to the Peace Eye bookstore, in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] on 10th Street between Avenues B and Ave C, founded in 1965 by poet [[Ed Sanders]], Smith had advised Sanders which books about Native American studies the store ought to stock. When Sanders and [[Tuli Kupferberg]] formed the [[The Fugs|Fugs]], they rehearsed at Peace Eye. \"Thanks to Harry,\" writes Sanders, \"the band was able to record an album within weeks of forming.\"<ref>Sanders, Liner Notes (2000), p. 21.</ref> Peter Stampfel recalled that, as the album's editor and producer, \"Harry's contribution to the proceedings were his presence, inspiration, and best of all, smashing a wine bottle against the wall while we were recording 'Nothing,'\"<ref>[http://www.furious.com/perfect/harrysmith.html Peter Stampfel, \"Harry Smith Tribute, May. 1997\", ''Perfect Sound Forever Online Magazine''.]</ref> But Sanders recalled learning a lot from watching Smith's adept, businesslike tape editing at the Folkways studio, adding that, as far as he knew, Smith received no financial reward for his work. He asked for a bottle of rum, which Sanders bought for him, and then proceeded to smash the bottle against the wall, to \"spur us to greater motivity and energy\", Sanders speculated.<ref>Ed Sanders, ''Fug You: An Informal History of the Peace Eye Bookstore, the Fuck You Press, the Fugs, and Counterculture in the Lower East Side'' (Philadelphia, Pa.: Da Capo Press, 2011), p. 142.</ref>\n\nIn 1971\u201373 Smith recorded performances held at his room at the [[Hotel Chelsea]] (for a project called \"deonage\") of, among other things, spontaneously composed folk and protest songs written and performed by his long-time friend, [[Allen Ginsberg]], accompanying himself on the [[Pump organ|harmonium]]. These included, \"CIA Dope Calypso\", \"MacDougal Street Blues\", \"Bus Ride Ballad Ride to Suva\", and \"Dope Fiend Blues\", among others, all later issued on an LP entitled ''New York Blues: Rags, Ballads and Harmonium Songs'' (Folkways, 1981).\n\nIn keeping with his interest in chemically altered states of consciousness, Smith made field recordings documenting Kiowa peyote meeting songs, which Folkways issued as a multi-LP set.\n\n===Experimental films===\nCritical attention has been most often paid to Smith's [[experimental film|experimental work with film]]. He produced extravagant abstract animations. The effects were often painted or manipulated by hand [[Direct Films|directly]] on the [[celluloid]]. Themes of mysticism, [[surrealism]] and [[dada]] were common elements in his work.<ref>The main sources of the filmography: Harry Smith Archives ({{cite web |url=http://www.harrysmitharchives.com/1_bio/cv.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126014437/http://www.harrysmitharchives.com/1_bio/cv.html |archivedate=November 26, 2005 |df=mdy-all }} & {{cite web |url=http://www.harrysmitharchives.com/3_store/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-01-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050213172853/http://harrysmitharchives.com/3_store/index.html |archivedate=February 13, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}), [[Anthology Film Archives]] ([http://www.anthologyfilmarchives.org/schedule/?start=2006-9-15&end=2006-9-21]) & [http://www.anthologyfilmarchives.org/schedule/?start=2006-3-01&end=2006-3-07]), Krugman Associates ({{cite web |url=http://www.krugmaninc.com/title_jump.asp?TITLE=EARLY+ABSTRACTIONS |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818013246/http://www.krugmaninc.com/title_jump.asp?TITLE=EARLY+ABSTRACTIONS |archivedate=August 18, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}, {{cite web |url=http://www.krugmaninc.com/title_jump.asp?TITLE=HEAVEN+AND+EARTH+MAGIC |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818013304/http://www.krugmaninc.com/title_jump.asp?TITLE=HEAVEN+AND+EARTH+MAGIC |archivedate=August 18, 2007 |df=mdy-all }} & \n{{cite web |url=http://www.krugmaninc.com/title_jump.asp?TITLE=LATE+SUPERIMPOSITIONS |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819011547/http://www.krugmaninc.com/title_jump.asp?TITLE=LATE+SUPERIMPOSITIONS |archivedate=August 19, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}, [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0808421 IMDb], articles by [http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2005/36/harry_smith/ Jamie Sexton], [http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2005/cteq/early_abstractions/ Dirk de Bruyn] (both Senses of Cinema), [http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=7635 Eric L.

He frequently reedited them (hence the different runtimes), incorporating on various occasions reassembled footage of different film to be viewed with varying music tracks. For instance, the handmade films now known as No. 1, 2, 3, and 5 were accompanied by an improvising jazz band on May 12, 1950 when they premiered as part of the ''Art in Cinema'' series curated by Smith's friend [[Frank Stauffacher]] at the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art|San Francisco Museum of Art]], though Smith had originally intended them to be accompanied by recordings of beat favorite [[Dizzy Gillespie]]. Later he showed the films with random records or even the radio as accompaniment. Smith stated that his films were made for contemporary music, and he kept changing their soundtracks. At the urging of his friend Rosemarie \"Rosebud\" Feliu-Pettet, Smith also re-cut ''[[Early Abstractions]]'' to sync with ''[[Meet the Beatles!]]''. After Smith's death, artists such as [[John Zorn]], [[Philip Glass]] or [[DJ Spooky]] provided musical backgrounds for screenings of his films: Zorn at many screenings at [[Anthology Film Archives]] (where he is composer-in-residence) as part of his Essential Cinema project, Glass at the 2004 summer benefit concert of [[the Film-Makers' Cooperative]] and DJ Spooky at several venues in 1999 for ''Harry Smith: A Re-creation'', an embroidered compendium of Smith's films put together by his close collaborator M. Henry Jones who tries to screen the films in the manner intended by Smith - as performances - using stroboscopic effects, multiple projections, magic lanterns, and the like.<ref>[http://www.centerforvisualmusic.org/VMFilms.htm Center for Visual Music], [http://www.film-makerscoop.com/benefit.html The Film-Makers' Cooperative], [http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74669 Chris Baker: A Waking Dream] ([[Austin Chronicle]]), [http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=4689 Ain't It Cool News)], [http://citypages.com/databank/20/958/article7464.asp Reconstructing Harry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050911022222/http://www.citypages.com/databank/20/958/article7464.asp |date=September 11, 2005 }} ([[City Pages]]).</ref>\n\nThe present-day numbering system which Smith introduced some time between 1951 and 1964\u201365 (the year [[the Film-Makers' Cooperative]] started distributing 16&nbsp;mm copies of his films) includes only films that survived up to that point. Thus this filmography is in no way a comprehensive list of all the films he has ever made, all the more as he is known to have lost, sold, traded or even wantonly destroyed some of his own works. The dating of the film presents another puzzle. Since Smith frequently worked for years on them and kept little to no documentation, the information varies considerably from one source to another. Therefore all available information has been added to the following list, inevitably resulting in a loss of clarity but having the advantage of giving the whole picture. The films are also known by variant designation, i.e. ''Film No. 1'', ''Film # 1'' or simply ''# 1''.\n\nSince the 1970s Smith's films have been archived and preserved at [[Anthology Film Archives]] in New York City.\n\nThe Academy Film Archive preserved \"Abstractions,\" films 1-3, and \"Freedom and Famine\" by Harry Smith.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserved Projects|url=http://www.oscars.org/academy-film-archive/preserved-projects?title=&filmmaker=harry+smith&category=All&collection=All|website=Academy Film Archive}}</ref>\n\n===Visual art===\nSmith's early efforts in the field of [[fine art]] painting were [[:wikt:freeform|freeform]] [[abstraction]]s intended to visually represent notes, measures, [[Beat (music)|beats]] and [[riff]]s of the [[beatnik|beatnik era]] [[jazz music]] that [[muse|inspired]] him.\n\nThere is photographic evidence of Smith's large paintings created in the 1940s; however, the works themselves were destroyed by Smith himself. He did not destroy his work on film (although he did misplace a few) and this legacy supplements the nature and design of his paintings. Smith created several later works, some of which have been serially printed in limited editions. Much of his imagery is inspired by [[Hermetic Qabalah|Kabbalistic]] themes such as the [[Sephirah]], where the [[Planetary spheres|Planetary Spheres]] are distributed like musical notes upon a staff.\n\n===Occult interests===\nSmith said he had become acquainted with the [[Lummi]] Indians through his mother's teaching work and claimed to have participated in [[shaman|shamanic initiation]] at a young age. He recorded Lummi songs and rituals using homemade equipment and notation of his own devising and developed an important collection of Native American religious objects.\n\nTarot cards were another of Smith's interests. A set of \"irregularly-shaped Tarot cards\" he designed was apparently used for the degree certificates for a branch of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] founded by occult \"magus\" [[Aleister Crowley]].<ref name=\"Sanders, Liner Notes 2000 p. 24\">Sanders, Liner Notes (2000), p. 24.</ref> In the late 1940s in California Smith is said to have worked with the reputed occult \"magus\" Aleister Crowley's one-time acolyte [[Charles Stansfeld Jones]],{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} a convert to Roman Catholicism, and later with Jones's \"trusted student\", Albert Handel<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=j3uVfRl9kWEC&pg=PR30&dq=albert+handel&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1qiTUqn0HtHKsQT5soDwBQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=albert%20handel&f=false Albert Handel]</ref> in New York.\n\nSmith frequented the [[Weiser Antiquarian Books|Samuel Weiser Antiquarian Bookstore]], a used book store on New York's \"Book Row\" that specialized in works on [[comparative religion]], [[hermeticism]], and the [[occult]]. The store also had a publishing house, Weiser Books, which used Smith's designs for its paperback edition of Aleister Crowley's ''[[Holy Books of Thelema]]''.<ref name=\"Sanders, Liner Notes 2000 p. 24\"/>\n\n[[Ed Sanders|Sanders]] recounts that Smith was the key advisor for [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[The Fugs]] 's effort to levitate [[The Pentagon]]. \"In the fall of 1967,\" he wrote:\n\n<blockquote> a bunch of us decided to exorcise the demons from the Pentagon as part of a big demonstration against the Vietnam War. (You can get a flavor of that day from [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[Armies of the Night]]''.) I was in charge of coming up with a structure for the Exorcism. I knew Harry would know what to do so I conferred with him. He gave me the basic outline, which was to use the symbols of the four directions, and to use the symbols of earth, air, fire, and water. He also suggested adding a cow, to represent the Goddess Hathor. We did have a cow prepared, painted with mythic symbols, but the police stopped it from getting near the Pentagon. The Exorcism was duly recorded by WBAI's Bob Fass, and can be found on the Fugs album ''Tenderness Junction''.<ref name=\"Sanders, Liner Notes 2000 p. 24\"/></blockquote>\n\nSmith also studied the [[Enochian magic|Enochian]] system in depth and as it was recounted by [[Edward Kelley]] and [[John Dee]], and as later elaborated upon by the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]]. He also compiled a concordance of the Enochian language with the aid of Khem Caigan, his assistant throughout much of the 1970s and early 1980s.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nIn 1986 Smith was consecrated a bishop in the [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]], which claims [[William Blake]] and [[Giordano Bruno]] in its pantheon of saints. Smith had long been a familiar figure in the New York branch of [[Ordo Templi Orientis]]. After his death, Smith's branch of the sect performed a Gnostic Mass in his honor at St. Mark's Church in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].<ref name=\"Sanders, Liner Notes 2000 p. 24\"/>\n\n===Later life and death===\nHarry Smith lived at the [[Hotel Chelsea]] on West 23rd Street in New York City, residing in Room #731 from 1968 to 1977, after which he was \"sometimes 'stranded' at hotels where he would owe so much money he couldn't leave, and he was too famous just to be thrown out\".<ref>Sanders, Liner Notes (2000) p. 26</ref> This was the case at the Breslin Hotel at 28th and Broadway, where Smith lived until 1985, when his friend, poet Allen Ginsberg, took him into his home on East 12th Street. While living with Ginsberg, Smith designed the cover for two of Ginsberg's books, ''White Shroud'' and ''Collected Poems'', as well as continuing to work on his own films and to record ambient sounds. For many years subsisting on a diet of raw eggs, vodka and amphetamine tablets{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}, by this time, Smith was suffering from severe health and dental problems.  He proved a difficult guest. Ginsberg's psychiatrist finally told him that Smith would have to leave because he was bad for Ginsberg's blood pressure (Ginsberg was already suffering from the cardiovascular disease that was to kill him). In 1988 Ginsberg arranged for Smith to teach shamanism at the Naropa Institute (now [[Naropa University]]) in Boulder, Colorado. When Ginsberg, who was paying all of Smith's expenses, realized Smith was using the money he was sending him for rent to buy alcohol, he hired Rani Singh, then a student at Naropa, to look after him, but not before Smith had amassed substantial debts that Ginsberg would be responsible for.<ref>Bill Morgan, ''I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg'' (Viking Group, 2006), p. 607.</ref> Singh, now an author and art curator, has since devoted much of her life to furthering Smith's legacy.\n\nSmith returned to New York, staying for a while with friends in Cooperstown, New York, and ending up at one point at Francis House, a home for derelicts on the Bowery. All the while he continued to tape ambient sounds, including \"the dying coughs and prayers of impoverished sick people in adjacent cubicles.\"<ref>Allen Ginsberg quoted in Sanders, Liner Notes (2000) p. 29</ref>\n\nIn November 1991, Smith suffered a bleeding ulcer followed by cardiac arrest in Room 328 at the [[Hotel Chelsea]] in [[New York City]]. His friend, poet [[Paola Igliori]], described him as dying in her arms, \"singing as he drifted away\".<ref>[http://blogs.indiewire.com/pressplay/grey_matters_remembering_lance_loud \"Grey Matters: Young and old memories of the Hotel Chelsea\"] by Ian Grey, ''[[indieWire|Indie Wire]]'', 12 August 2011</ref> Smith was pronounced dead one hour later at [[St. Vincent's Hospital (Manhattan)|St. Vincent's Hospital]].\n\nSmith's ashes are in the care of his friend, longtime participant in New York's [[Beat Generation|Beat]] scene, Rosemarie \"Rosebud\" Feliu-Pettet, whom Paola Igliori has described as Smith's \"spiritual wife.\"<ref name=allen>[http://www.allenginsberg.org/index.php?page=paola-igliori-interview-on-harry-smith Allen Ginsberg & Paola Igliori, 24 September 1995], at the AllenGinsberg.org</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n*''[[Early Abstractions]]'' (1939-56 or 1941-57 or 1946-52 or 1946-57) (assembled ca. 1964) 16&nbsp;mm, black & white and color, 22 min.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that couldn't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that couldn't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy.

A water recycling device was used in the lotus lake of the set, allowing ripples to be seen on the lake surface. A special ceiling was built for the ancestral hall.<ref name=zhuan /> \n\nFor the Qinghe Nie sect, the set was designed to be surrounded by high walls and the entrance isn't easily seen because it was often invaded by Qishan Wen sect. For Qishan Wen sect, designs from the [[Shang dynasty]] were used.

The other clubs were [[St Kilda Football Club]], [[Essendon Football Club]], [[Fitzroy Football Club]], [[Melbourne Football Club]], [[Geelong Football Club]], [[Carlton Football Club]] and [[Collingwood Football Club]].\n\n===VFL entry: 1897\u20131909===\nSouth Melbourne was one of the original founding clubs of the [[Victorian Football League (1897\u20131989)|Victorian Football League]] that was formed in 1897.\n\n===Premiership success: 1909\u20131945===\nThe club had early success and won three VFL premierships in 1909, 1918 and 1933. The club was at its most successful in the 1930s, when key recruits from both Victoria and interstate led to a string of appearances in the finals, including four successive grand final appearances from 1933 to 1936, albeit with only one premiership in 1933.  The collection of players recruited from interstate in 1932/1933 became known as South Melbourne's \"Foreign Legion\".<ref>The caricature at the foot of [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/149547747/17704724 page 10 of ''Table Talk'' (22 June 1933)] was created by Richard \"Dick\" Ovenden (1897\u20131972). From left to right those represented are: [[Jack Bisset]], the team's captain; [[Dick Mullaly]], the club's secretary; [[Brighton Diggins]], from Subiaco (WAFL); [[Bert Beard]], from South Fremantle (WAFL); [[Bill Faul]], from Subiaco (WAFL); [[Jim O'Meara]], from East Perth (WAFL); [[Frank Davies (footballer, born 1907)|Frank Davies]], from City (NTFA); [[Laurie Nash]], from City (NTFA); [[John Bowe (footballer)|John Bowe]], from Subiaco (WAFL); [[Jack Wade (footballer)|Jack Wade]], from Port Adelaide (SANFL); [[Ossie Bertram]], from West Torrens (SANFL); and [[Wilbur Harris]], from West Torrens (SANFL).</ref>\n\nOn grand final eve, 1935, as the Swans prepared to take on Collingwood, star full-forward Bob Pratt was clipped by a truck moments after stepping off a tram and subsequently missed the match for South. Ironically, the truck driver was a South Melbourne supporter.<ref>Shaw, I.W. (2006) ''The Bloodbath''. Scribe Publications.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period that the team became known as the Swans. The nickname, which was suggested by a [[Herald and Weekly Times]] artist in 1933, was inspired by the number of Western Australians in the team (the [[black swan]] being the state emblem of Western Australia), and was formally adopted by the club before the following season 1934.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sporting Globe|date=24 January 1934|location=Melbourne|title=Real story behind South Melbourne's football premiership|page=7|author=J. M. Rohan}}</ref> The name stuck, in part due to the club's association with nearby [[Albert Park and Lake]], also known for its [[swan]]s (although there are no longer any non-native white swans and only black, indigenous swans in the lake).\n\nAfter several years with only limited success, South Melbourne next reached the grand final in 1945. The match, played against Carlton, was to become known as \"the Bloodbath\", courtesy of the brawl that overshadowed the match, with a total of 9 players being reported by the umpires. Carlton won the match by 28 points, and from then on, South Melbourne struggled.\n\n===Struggling times: 1946\u20131981===\nIn the following years, South Melbourne consistently struggled, as their traditional inner-city recruiting district largely emptied as a result of demographic shifts. The club missed the finals in 1946 and continued to fall such that by 1950 they were second-last on the ladder. They nearly made the finals in 1952, but from 1953 to 1969, they never finished higher than eighth on the ladder. By the 1960s it was clear that South Melbourne's financial resources would not be capable of allowing them to compete in the growing market for country and interstate players, and their own local zone was never strong enough to compensate for this. The introduction of country [[zoning (Australian rules football)|zoning]] failed to help, as the [[Riverina Football League]] proved to be one of the least profitable zones.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1981, South Melbourne made the finals only twice: under legendary coach [[Norm Smith]], South Melbourne finished fourth in 1970, but lost the first semi-final; and, in 1977, the club finished fifth under coach Ian Stewart, but lost the elimination final. In that time, they \"won\" three [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoons]]. Between Round 7, 1972 and Round 13, 1973, the team lost 29 consecutive games. By the end of the 1970s South Melbourne were saddled with massive debts after struggling for such a long period of time.\n\n==Sydney history==\n{{recentism|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Early years in Sydney: 1982\u20131987===\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the VFL was strategically interested in seeing a club based in Sydney, as part of a long-term plan to broaden the appeal of the game in [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]. The league had started moving a few premiership matches to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] annually since 1979, and in 1981 was preparing to establish an entirely new, 13th VFL club in Sydney after the [[Fitzroy Lions]] staved off a proposed relocation to become the Sydney Lions in late 1980. These plans halted when the South Melbourne board, recognising the difficulties it faced with viability and financial stability in Melbourne, made the decision to play all 1982 home games in Sydney. The club had been operating at a loss of at least $150,000 for the previous five years. News of the proposal broke on 2 July 1981, after which a letter was sent to members outlining the board's reasons for making the proposal and noting that the coach and current players were in favour of the move.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2019-07-02/on-this-day-swans-move-to-sydney|title=On This Day: Swans move to Sydney|website=sydneyswans.com.au|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> On 29 July 1981, the VFL formally accepted the proposal, and paved the way for the Swans to shift to Sydney in 1982.\n\nThe move caused great internal difficulties, as a group of supporters known as Keep South at South campaigned throughout the rest of 1981 to stop the move; and, at an [[extraordinary general meeting]] on 22 September, the group democratically took control of the club's board. However, the new board did not have the power to unilaterally stop the move to Sydney: under the VFL constitution, to rescind the decision that had been made on 29 July required a three-quarters majority in a vote of all twelve clubs, and at a meeting on 14 October it failed to obtain this majority.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|title=VFL 'no' sends South to Sydney|author=Mike Coward|date=15 October 1981|page=32}}</ref> The new board also lacked the support of the players, the vast majority of whom were in favour of a long-term move to Sydney; in early November, after the board promised that it would try to bring the club back to Melbourne in 1983, the players went on strike, seeking to force the new board commit to Sydney in the long term as well as seeking payments that the cash-strapped club owed them from the previous season.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|page=40|author=Geoff Slattery|date=7 November 1981|title=South Players on strike}}</ref> The board ended up undermining its own position when it accepted a $400,000 loan from the VFL in late November to stay solvent, under the condition that it commit to Sydney for two years. Finally, in early December, the Keep South at South board resigned and a board in favour of the move to Sydney was installed.<ref name=\"saga\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Roar|title=Revisiting the South Melbourne to Sydney saga|date=6 July 2012|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/07/06/the-south-to-sydney-saga/|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1982 Escort Championships|1982 Escort Championships Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  {{AFL Swa}}|| '''13''' ||'''12''' ||'''90'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  {{AFL Nor}} || 8 || 10 || 58\n|-\n| Venue: [[Waverley Park]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 20,028\n|}\n\nUpon moving, the club played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In 1982, the club was technically a Melbourne-based club which played all of its home games in Sydney; it dropped the name \"South Melbourne\" in June 1982, becoming known as simply \"the Swans\" for the rest of that season.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|location=Melbourne|first=Peter|last=Simunovich|title=The Swans \u2013 officially|date=3 June 1982|page=67}}</ref> It was not until 1983 that the club formally moved its operations to Sydney and became the Sydney Swans.<ref name=\"saga\" /> Its physical \"home club\" was the \"Southern Cross Social Club\" at 120a Clovelly Road, Randwick, New South Wales which became bankrupt in 1987; new Sydney Swans Offices were then set up in the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].\n\n[[File:Sydney80s.png|frame|left|Sydney 1980s shield logo]]\n\nOn 31 July 1985, for what was thought to be [[Australian dollar|$]]6.3&nbsp;million, [[Geoffrey Edelsten]] \"bought\" the Swans; in reality it was $2.9&nbsp;million in cash with funding and other payments spread over five years. Edelsten resigned as chairman in less than twelve months, but had already made his mark. He immediately recruited former Geelong coach [[Tom Hafey]]. Hafey, in turn, used his knowledge of Geelong's contracts to recruit [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], who would all form a key part of the Sydney side, at a league-determined total fee of $240,000 (less than the $500,000 Geelong demanded and even the $300,000 Sydney offered).<ref>Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', page 91. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995</ref> The likes of [[Gerard Healy]], [[Merv Neagle]] and [[Paul Morwood]] were also poached from other clubs, and failed approaches were made to [[Simon Madden]], [[Terry Daniher]], [[Andrew Bews]] and [[Maurice Rioli]].<ref>Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', p. 93. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995</ref>\n\nDuring the Edelsten years, the Swans were seen by the Sydney public as a flamboyant club, typified by the style of its spearhead, [[Warwick Capper]], his long bright blond [[mullet (hairstyle)|mullet]] and bright pink boots made him unmissable on the field and his pink Lamborghini, penchant for fashion models and eccentricity made him notorious off the field \u2013 all somewhat [[1980s in fashion|fashionable in the 1980s]]. During Capper's peak years, the Swans had made successive finals appearances for the first time since relocating. His consistently spectacular aerial exploits earned him consecutive [[Mark of the Year]] awards while his goalkicking efforts (amassing 103 goals in 1987) made him runner up in the Coleman Medal two years running. The Swans\u2019 successive finals appearances saw crowds during this time peak at an average of around 25,000 per game. Edelsten also introduced the \"Swanettes\", becoming the sole such cheerleading group among VFL teams following the disbandment of Carlton's Blue Birds in 1986. The Swanettes did not get much performance time, owing to the short intervals between quarters of play in the VFL and the lack of space in which they might perform while other activities take place on the field. The Swanettes were soon discontinued and no club has had cheerleaders since then.\n\nIn 1987, the Swans scored 201 points against the [[West Coast Eagles]] and the following week scored 236 points against the [[Essendon Football Club]]. Both games were at the SCG. The Swans remain one of only two clubs to have scored consecutive team tallies above 200 points, the only other being Geelong in 1992.<ref>[[1992 AFL season]]</ref> However, this was followed by several heavy losses, including defeat by Hawthorn by 99 points in the Qualifying Final and by 76 points against Melbourne in the First Semi-final.\n\n===Dark times: 1988\u20131994===\nThe club's form was to slump in the following year.\n\nLosses were in the millions. A group of financial backers including [[Mike Willesee]], Basil Sellers, Peter Weinert and Craig Kimberley purchased the licence and bankrolled the club until 1993, when the AFL stepped in.\n\nMorale at the side plummeted as players were asked to take pay cuts.<ref>[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie rules for dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008), p.128</ref> Legendary coach [[Tom Hafey]] was sacked by the club in 1988 after a player-led rebellion at his tough training methods (unusual in the semi-professional days of that era).\n\nCapper was sold to the Brisbane Bears for $400,000 in a desperate attempt to improve the club's finances. Instead, it only led to disastrous on-field performances. Instead of a 100-goal-a-season forward, Sydney's goalkicking was led by [[Bernard Toohey]] (usually a defender) with 29 in 1989, then Jim West with 34 in 1990. Players left the club in droves, including Brownlow Medalist [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Barry Mitchell (footballer)|Barry Mitchell]]. The careers of stars such as [[Dennis Carroll]], [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Ian Roberts (footballer)|Ian Roberts]], [[Tony Morwood]] and [[David Murphy (Australian rules footballer)|David Murphy]] wound down,<ref>Cowley, Michael (19 October 2009) [http://www.smh.com.au/afl/afl-news/gen-next-must-fly-for-swans-as-wily-old-birds-go-20091124-j2aa.html Gen Next must fly for Swans as wily old birds go]</ref> while promising young players like [[Jamie Lawson (Australian footballer)|Jamie Lawson]], [[Robert Teal]] and [[Paul Bryce]] had their careers cut short by injury.\n\nAttendances consistently dropped below 10,000 when the team performed poorly between 1990 and 1994. The nadir came with three consecutive wooden spoons in 1992, 1993 and 1994.\n\nThe AFL stepped in to save the Swans, offering substantial monetary and management support. The club survived, despite strong rumours in 1992 that it would merge with the [[Brisbane Bears]] to form a combined New South Wales/Queensland team, fold altogether, or even move back to South Melbourne.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} With draft and salary cap concessions in the early 1990s and a series of notable recruits, the team became competitive after the early part of the decade.\n\nDuring this time, the side was largely held together by two inspirational skippers, both from the [[Wagga Wagga]] region of country New South Wales, [[Dennis Carroll]] and later the courageous captain [[Paul Kelly (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Kelly]].\n\nDesperate to hang on, the club was keen to enlist the biggest names and identities in the AFL, and recruited legendary coach [[Ron Barassi]] who helped save the club from extinction while serving them as coach from Round 7, 1993 to 1995. At roughly the same time, Hawthorn legend [[Dermott Brereton]] was also recruited, albeit with little on-field impact. On a much brighter side for the Swans, their captain Paul Kelly won the League's highest individual honour, the [[Brownlow Medal]], in 1995.\n\n===Tony Lockett and grand final return: 1995\u20132001===\nA big coup for the club was recruitment of [[St Kilda Football Club]] champion [[Tony Lockett|Tony \"Plugger\" Lockett]] in 1995. Lockett became a cult figure in Sydney, with an instant impact and along with the [[Super League war]] in the dominant rival [[rugby league]] football code in Australia, helped the Swans to become a powerhouse Sydney icon.\n\n1995 would be Barassi's last year in charge. The Swans won eight games \u2013 as many as they did in the previous three seasons combined \u2013 and finished with a percentage of over 100 (in fact, they have managed such consistently ever since). They were also one of only two teams to defeat the all-conquering Carlton side of that year. Swans great Paul Kelly also won the [[Brownlow Medal]] that year. Barassi left an improving team, a club in a much better state than he found them.\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1996 AFL season|1996 AFL Home & Away Season]]'' || ''W'' || ''L'' || ''D'' ||''Total'' || ''%''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  '''Sydney Swans''' || '''16''' || '''5''' || '''1''' || '''66''' || '''123.9'''\n|-\n|\n| colspan=9 | ''Minor Premiers''\n|}\n\nFormer Hawthorn player Rodney Eade took over the reins in 1996 and after a slow start (they lost their first two games of the season), turned the club around into powerful force. The Swans ended the minor round on top of the premiership table with 16 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw. In the finals, the Swans won one of the most thrilling AFL preliminary finals in history after Plugger Lockett kicked a behind after the siren to win the game. The Swans lost the grand final to {{AFL Nor}}, which had been their first appearance in a grand final since 1945. The game was played in front of 93,102 at the [[MCG]].\n\nThe Swans then made the finals for four of the next five full years that Rodney Eade was in charge. In 1998 they finished 3rd on the AFL ladder; despite beating {{AFL StK}} in their first final the Swans were then beaten by eventual premiers {{AFL Ade}} in the semi-final at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]].\n\nThe 1999 season was a largely uneventful year for the club, the only real highlight being [[Tony Lockett]] kicking his record-breaking 1300th goal against {{AFL Col}} in Round 10. The 1999 season ended with a 69-point mauling at the hands of minor premiers {{AFL Ess}}.\n\nAfter missing the finals in [[2000 AFL season|2000]], the Swans rebounded to finish 7th in [[2001 AFL season|2001]], but were beaten by {{AFL Haw}} by 55 points in their elimination final at [[Colonial Stadium]].\n\n===Rebuilding and finals return: 2002\u20132004===\nFormer Swans favourite son [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]] was appointed caretaker coach midway through the 2002 season, replacing Rodney Eade who was removed after Round 12. Roos won six of the remaining 10 games that year (including the last four of the season) and was installed as the permanent coach from the 2003 season onwards, despite rumors that Sydney had nearly concluded a deal with [[Terry Wallace]].\n\nRoos continued a record as a successful coach with the Swans for the eight full seasons that would follow.\n\nA new home ground in [[ANZ Stadium]] (then known as Telstra Stadium) provided increased capacity over the SCG. The Swans' first game played at the Stadium in Round 9, 2002 against {{AFL Ess}} attracted 54,169 spectators. The Sydney Swans v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] match on 23 August 2003 set an attendance record for the largest crowd to watch an AFL game outside of Victoria with an official attendance of 72,393 and was the largest home and away AFL crowd at any stadium for 2003. A preliminary final against the [[Brisbane Lions]] in 2003 attracted 71,019 people. The Swans lost all three of those significant matches.\n\n2004 saw an average year for Sydney, however one highlight was when they ended {{AFL StK}}'s undefeated start to the season in Round 11. The match was notable for [[Leo Barry]]'s effort in nullifying the impact of St Kilda full-forward and eventual [[Coleman Medal]]list [[Fraser Gehrig]], whom Barry restricted to only two possessions for the entire match.\n\nSydney was able to recruit another St Kilda export in the Lockett mould, [[Barry Hall]]. There were obvious parallels to the signing of Lockett (a powerful, tough forward from St Kilda with questions over his discipline and attitude), which left Hall with much to live up to. He flourished in his new surroundings and eventually became a cult figure and club leader in his own right.\n\nAs the new century dawned, Sydney implemented a policy of giving up high order draft picks in exchange for players who struggled at other clubs. It was during this era that the Swans picked up the likes of [[Paul Williams (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Williams]], [[Barry Hall]], [[Craig Bolton]], [[Darren Jolly]], [[Ted Richards]], [[Peter Everitt]], [[Martin Mattner]], [[Rhyce Shaw]], [[Shane Mumford]], [[Ben McGlynn]] and [[Mitch Morton]], amongst others, and giving up higher order draft picks meant the Swans missed out on the likes of [[Daniel Motlop]], [[Nick Dal Santo]], [[James Kelly (Australian footballer)|James Kelly]], [[Courtenay Dempsey]] and [[Sam Lonergan]] who went to {{AFL Por}}, {{AFL StK}}, {{AFL Gee}} and the latter two to {{AFL Ess}} respectively. This policy is said to have paid off in the Roos era, as they implemented a strict culture of discipline at the club.\n\n===Premiership glory: 2005===\n{{Main|2005 AFL Grand Final}}\n{{Wikinews|Sydney Swans win AFL premiership after 72 years in classic match}}\nIn 2005, the Swans came under enormous public scrutiny, even from AFL CEO [[Andrew Demetriou]], for their unorthodox, \"boring\" defense-oriented tactics that included tightly controlling the tempo of the game and starving the opposition of possession (in fact, seven teams that season had their lowest possession total whilst playing against the Swans). Swans coach [[Paul Roos (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Roos]] maintained that playing contested football was the style used by all recent Premiership-winning teams, and felt that it was ironic that the much criticised strategy proved ultimately successful.\n\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n|width=35%\n|align=right\n|quote=Nick Davis!

In the first preliminary final at the MCG on 16 September against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], the Swans used a seven-goal blitz in 11 minutes of the fourth quarter to overturn an 8-point deficit and overrun the Saints by 15.6 (96) to 9.11 (65).\n\nThe Swans faced the Eagles in a rematch in the [[AFL Grand Final]] on 24 September 2005, and this time, they prevailed by four points, final score 8.10 (58) to West Coast's 7.12 (54). In the last few minutes, the Sydney defence held strong, with [[Leo Barry]] marking the ball just before the siren to stop the Eagles' final desperate shot at goal. The Premiership was the Swans' first in 72 years and their first since being based in Sydney. It was also the fifth Premiership in succession to be won by a team from outside [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[2005 AFL Grand Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  '''Sydney Swans''' || '''8''' || '''10''' || '''58'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[West Coast Eagles]] || 7  || 12 || 54\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 91,898\n|}\n\nOn Friday, 30 September 2005, a [[ticker tape parade]] down Sydney's [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] was held in honour of the Swans' achievements, which ended with a rally at [[Town Hall]], where Sydney [[Lord Mayor of Sydney|Lord Mayor]] [[Clover Moore]] presented the team with the key to the city.

Ryan O'Keefe was named the Norm Smith Medallist and the Swan's best player in September\n\n[[File:Sydney Swans warming up 2013.jpg|thumb|The Sydney Swans warm up before a match in 2013.]]\nThe Swans' [[2013 AFL season|2013 season]] was marred by long-term injuries to many of its key players, namely [[Adam Goodes]], Sam Reid, [[Lewis Jetta]], [[Rhyce Shaw]] and [[Lewis Roberts-Thomson]], among others; despite this setback, the team were still able to reach the finals for the fifteenth time in 18 seasons, reaching the preliminary finals where they were defeated by {{AFL Fre}} at [[Subiaco Oval|Patersons Stadium]], its first loss at the venue since 2009.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2013-09-21/dockers-smother-swans Dockers smother Swans to reach first Grand Final], AFL.com.au official website, 21 September 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.theroar.com.au/2013/09/26/2013-afl-season-review-sydney-swans/ 2013 AFL Season review: Sydney Swans], ''The Roar'', 26 September 2013</ref>\n\nThe 2014 AFL season began with some difficulties for the Swans. Sydney lost their first game against {{AFL GWS}} and then to Collingwood before becoming the first non-South Australian team to win at [[Adelaide Oval]] defeating Adelaide by 63 points with Lance Franklin and Luke Parker kicking 4 goals each. After a loss to North Melbourne in Round 4, the Swans' won twelve games in a row, including victories against 2013 grand finalists Fremantle and Hawthorn, Geelong by 110 points at the SCG and then ladder leaders Port Adelaide. In Round 17, the Swans defeated Carlton to match a winning streak set three times in club history, the last of which came way back in 1935,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thenewdaily.com.au/sport/2014/07/12/dozen-unstoppable-sydney-swans/|title=Dozen up for unstoppable Swans \u2013 The New Daily|date=12 July 2014|publisher=}}</ref> and eventually closed out the season with their first minor premiership in 18 years and a club record 17 wins for the season, eclipsing the previous highest of 16, which was achieved on six past occasions in 2012, 1996, 1986, 1945, 1936 and 1935. In 2014 the Swans were minor premiers, and also qualified for the [[2014 AFL Grand Final]]. They defeated [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]] at home in the first qualifying final in Round one of the finals series and so earned a one-week break. In the first preliminary final the Swans had a convincing win against [[North Melbourne Kangaroos|North Melbourne]], which led them to their fourth grand final in 10 years. The [[2014 AFL Grand Final]] was played on Saturday 27 September 2014 in near perfect weather conditions, with Sydney seen as favourites leading up to the match. This was the first time in a finals series that former Hawk player [[Lance Franklin]] would play against his former team, one of very few players to have played back to back grand finals for two different teams. The Hawks dominated the game quite early and eventually defeated the Swans 11.8.(74) to 21.11.(137). The 63-point loss was Sydney's biggest ever loss in a grand final and their biggest defeat all season, meaning Hawthorn would become back to back premiers for the second time in their history.\n\nThe Swans started the 2015 AFL season well, winning their first three, before losing their next 2 games against [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]], where they trailed by as many as 8 goals before half-time, and the [[Western Bulldogs]]. They won their next 6 leading into the bye, including home wins against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], and an upset away win against [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] in the grand final replay. The Swans lost their first game after the bye, their 3rd of the season to [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] at the SCG, 11.11 (77) to 14.11. (95). The Swans rebounded with unconvincing wins against [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] and [[Brisbane Lions Football Club|Brisbane Lions]], before suffering their heaviest defeat for 17 seasons against the [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawks]] by 89 points.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/biggest-loss-in-17-years-a-humiliation-for-swans-says-luke-parker-20150719-gifoiw.html|title=Biggest loss in 17 years a humiliation for Swans, says Luke Parker|first=Sebastian|last=Hassett|date=19 July 2015|website=The Age}}</ref> The following week was no better with a road trip to Perth and another loss, this time to the [[West Coast Eagles|Eagles]] by 52 points, the scoreline ultimately flattering the Swans. The Swans bounced back against Adelaide with a convincing win 52-point win, but lost their next game to [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] at [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Simmonds stadium]]; a close affair that Geelong blew apart in the 3rd quarter. The Swans won their final 4 games to secure a top 4 finish, against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], {{AFL GWS}}, [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and {{AFL GCS}}.\n\nThe Swans faced minor premiers [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]] in the first qualifying final, their first finals match without Franklin, who had withdrawn from the finals due to illness.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-09-08/star-swan-franklin-out-of-final-against-freo-with-ongoing-mental-health-condition], AFL.com.au official website, 8 September 2015</ref> Ultimately the Swans would go down in a low scoring affair, effectively kicking themselves out of the game after losing [[Sam Reid (Australian footballer born 1991)|Sam Reid]] to a hamstring injury midway through the 2nd quarter.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-premiership/video-sam-reid-subbed-out-of-sydneys-qualifying-final-with-fremantle-with-hamstring-injury/story-e6frf3e3-1227524180065], Fox Sports, 12 September 2015</ref> The following week the Swans were knocked out of the finals in a one-sided contest against [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], struggling to score throughout the first half with the game effectively over by half-time. For the first time since 2011, the Swans failed to make a preliminary final.\n\nThe Swans' continued period of success, in which it has missed the finals only three times since 1995, has led to some criticism about a [[salary cap]] concession which the club receives; the concession is in the form of an additional Cost of Living Allowance (COLA), due to the higher cost of living in Sydney compared with any other Australian city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/salary-cap-gave-swans-the-flag-say-hawks/story-e6frexx0-1226497327257|title=Hawks and Crows critical of Swans' salary cap \u2013 thetelegraph.com.au|publisher=|date=16 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/afl/afl-turns-up-heat-on-sydneys-cost-of-living-allowance/story-e6frexwr-1226497138805|title=Dailytelegraph.com.au \u2013 Subscribe to The Daily Telegraph for exclusive stories|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au}}</ref> It was, however, announced in March 2014 that this allowance would be scrapped.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2014-03-04/afl-to-scrap-cola AFL to scrap COLA], AFL.com.au official website, 4 March 2014</ref> The trade ban was fought by the club before the 2015 season and a reprieve was won, with the AFL allowing the club to participate in the 2015 AFL draft. There was a catch however, with the league imposing an edict that the club could only recruit players at or below current average wage of $340,000 (adjusted figures for 2015 was $349,000).<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-01-21/swans-ok-to-trade-afl], AFL.com.au official website, 21 January 2015</ref> During the 2015 season, with the Swans team stretched by aging players and injuries, it had become apparent that the trade restrictions that had prevented the Swans from participating in the 2014 draft, had impacted the list. With the trade period looming, Andrew Pridham lobbied the AFL to lift the trade restrictions, labeling the ban as a restraint of trade.<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-08-14/swans-chairman-calls-for-trade-ban-to-be-banished], AFL.com.au official website, 14 August 2015</ref> In response to continued discussions between the club and league, as well as lobbying by the AFLPA,<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-players-association-joins-fight-over-sydney-swans-trading-ban-20150820-gj4504.html], ''The Age'', 20 August 2015</ref> the league further relaxed the trade restrictions for the Swans during the 2015 AFL Finals. The AFL changed the sanctions so that the Swans could replace a player that leaves the club as either a free agent, or through trade, with another player on a contract up to $450,000 per year. This allowed the Swans to trade for [[Callum Sinclair]] in a swap deal,<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-10-14/eagles-swans-agree-to-straight-sinclairjetta-swap], AFL.com.au official website, 14 October 2015</ref> as well as trade a late pick for out-of-contract defender, [[Michael Talia]] from the Western Bulldogs.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-trade-period-2015-former-bulldog-michael-talia-moves-to-swans-in-lastminute-trade-deal-20151022-gkfzhi.html], ''The Age'', 22 October 2015</ref>\n\nThe Swans started off the 2016 season with a convincing 80-point round 1 win against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], with new Swans recruit [[Michael Talia]] suffering a long term foot injury. They followed up the next round with a 60-point win against the Blues, with new recruit [[Callum Sinclair]] kicking 3 goals. The following week they defeated GWS by 25 points, with [[Lance Franklin]] kicking 4 goals. In the following match against the Crows, [[Isaac Heeney]] starred with 18 touches and 4 goals in a losing side. Three more wins followed, against West Coast, Brisbane and Essendon respectively before a shock loss to Richmond in round 8 by a solitary point, after a kick after the siren. They bounced back to win against top spot North Melbourne, and the Hawks at the MCG, with Lance Franklin booting 3 goals, including a bomb from 80 metres. After a tight slog against the Suns, the Swans played the Giants once more and were defeated in the club's 100th game. They won their next game by 55 points against the Demons, in a fourth quarter breeze. After a bye in Round 14, the Sydney Swans lost their first game after, again with the last kick of the game, by 4 points. The week after was soured by a family feud involving co-captain [[Kieren Jack]] and his parents, after they were reportedly told by him not to come to is 200-game milestone. After the spat, Jack led the Swans to an emphatic upset victory against Geelong, booting 3 goals and gathering 24 possessions in the one-sided 38-point victory at Simonds Stadium. They then travelled back home where they faced Hawthorn and lost their 3rd match of the season by under a goal, as Buddy went goalless for the first time in the season. After an unconvincing win the following week against Carlton, the Swans went on to win their last 5 home and away games by a combined total of 349 points, giving them top spot and a home qualifying final.\n\nAhead of their first final against cross-town rivals the Giants, the Swans confirmed that they would play all home finals at the SCG except for Sydney Derbies, which would be played at ANZ Stadium. The final would create history, being the first Sydney Derby to be played in a final. It was also the first time that the Giants would make the finals in their fifth year. In a low-scoring first half, the Swans were very competitive, trailing by only 2 points. However, a mark not paid to Isaac Heeney midway through the third quarter turned all the momentum the Giants way, as they kicked away to win by 36 points. The Swans only kicked 2 goals after half-time with Giant [[Jeremy Cameron]] outscoring them in the third quarter alone with 3 goals. They were quick to bounce back the following week, thumping the [[Adelaide Crows]] by 6 goals, with Franklin and [[Tom Papley]] kicking 4 goals a piece, after a blistering 7 goal to 1 quarter. The story was pretty much the same in the preliminary final against the [[Geelong Cats]] at the MCG. The Swans kept the Cats goalless for the first quarter, and were never really challenged in their 37-point triumph. It would take them to their third grand final in 5 years, against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. After leading by a scant 2-point margin at half time, the Bulldogs pulled away towards the end of the fourth quarter to hand Sydney their second grand final loss in three years.\n\nThe Swans began the 2017 season with six straight losses, after being upset at home by Port Adelaide in the opening round, they were upset by Collingwood and Carlton, and suffered defeats to the Western Bulldogs, Greater Western Sydney (who won their first game at the SCG) and West Coast Eagles (in Perth). However, they managed to win 13 of their last 15, losing both their games to [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] by 1 goal. Some of their best wins include against the reigning premiers the Bulldogs, GWS, and comeback wins against Richmond and Essendon. After becoming the first grand-finalist to lose their first six games, they have become the first team to reach the finals after starting the season 0\u20136. They would comprehensively defeat Essendon in their first final, before slumping to an ugly defeat against Geelong, ending their season.\n\nThe Swans had an indifferent 2018, compounded by their struggles at home, losing 5 out of 11 games at the SCG. A lean patch of form which included upset losses to Gold Coast (for the first time ever) and Essendon (for the first time since 2011) had them looking likely to miss finals altogether. However three out of four wins in the last four rounds was enough to see them into their ninth consecutive finals series, where they were comprehensively beaten by GWS in the Elimination Final.\n\nThe Swans' golden era of finals appearances came to an end in 2019. They missed the finals for the first time in a decade, finishing 15th on the ladder with eight wins and 14 losses. They started the season poorly with just one win in their first seven matches, although they would briefly recover after winning five of the next seven games. Six losses on the trot ended any chance of a tenth consecutive finals appearance, but strong wins over also-rans Melbourne and St Kilda in the final two rounds ensured the season ended on a positive note.\n\nThey won their first match of the interrupted 2020 season against Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval by three points.\n\n==Club identity==\n\n===Guernsey===\nThe jumper is white with a red back and a red yoke with a silhouette of the [[Sydney Opera House]] at the point of the yoke. The Opera House design was first used at the start of the 1987 season, replacing the traditional red \"V\" on white design. Until 1991, the back of the jumper was white with the yoke only extending to the back of the shoulders and each side of the jumper had a red vertical stripe. The current predominantly red design appeared at the start of the 1992 season. The club's major sponsor is [[QBE Insurance]]. In 2004 the club added the initials 'SMFC' in white lettering at the back of the collar to honour the club's past as South Melbourne Football Club. The move was welcomed by Melbourne-based fans. The clash guernsey is a predominantly white version of the home guernsey similar to the original Opera House guernsey design, including a white back, but it is rarely used, since the two Queensland clubs (the [[Brisbane Lions]] and [[Gold Coast Football Club|Gold Coast Suns]]) and cross town rivals [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|GWS Giants]] are the only clubs with which there is a clash.<ref>[http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2012-10-31/swans-2013-fixture-released Swans 2013 fixture released], Sydney Swans official website, 31 October 2012</ref>\n\n[[International Sports Clothing|ISC]] have manufactured the Swans' apparel since [[2010 AFL season|2010]], replacing long-time sponsor [[Puma SE|Puma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131104222641/http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-11-04|title=ISC 2018 COMING SOON|website=www.isc-sports.com.au}}</ref>\n\n====Uniform evolution====\nSince the club was called \"South Melbourne\", the team has worn different designs with the traditional red and white colors, as follows:<ref>[https://www.footyjumpers.com/seasons.htm VFL Uniforms by season (since 1897)] on FootyJumpers.com</ref>\n{|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _thinwhitehoops|pattern_so= _hoops_white|body= 002D62 |shorts= 002D62|socks= 002D62|title= 1874\u20131879}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _thinwhitehoops|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000 |shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1880-1904}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _3whitestripes|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1905\u201306}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redrightsash|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1907-11 & 13-31}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redleftsash|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1912}}\n|}\n{|\n|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= |pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= |socks= ffffff|title= 1920-1922}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n| pattern_b = _Vonwhite|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= 000000|socks= ffffff|title= 1932\u201374}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n| pattern_b = _Vonwhite|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= ff0000|socks= ffffff|title= 1975\u201386}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _swans19h|pattern_so= |body= ffffff|shorts= ff0000|socks= ff0000|title= 1987\u20132005}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _swans19h|pattern_so= _hoops_red |body= ffffff|shorts= ff0000|socks= |title= 2006\u2013present}}\n|}\n\n===Song===\nThe club song is known as ''Cheer, Cheer The Red and The White''' and is to the tune of the ''[[Victory March (fight song)|Victory March]]'', the fight song of the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] in South Bend, Indiana, USA, which was written by [[University of Notre Dame]] graduates and brothers Rev.

The rivalry was highlighted by Sydney's four-point win against West Coast in the [[2005 AFL Grand Final|2005 Grand Final]], and West Coast's one-point win against Sydney in the [[2006 AFL Grand Final|2006 Grand Final]].\n\n===Hawthorn===\n\nThe rivalry with [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] has been more recent, mostly defined by two grand finals ([[2012 AFL Grand Final|2012]] and [[2014 AFL Grand Final|2014]]). The Swans beat Hawthorn in 2012 by 10 points to claim their fifth premiership. The rivalry grew in 2013, when Hawthorn forward Lance Franklin transferred to the Swans as a free agent on a nine-year, $10&nbsp;million deal. In 2014, the Swans finished minor premiers and were favourites to win the grand final, however Hawthorn beat Sydney by 63 points. Both teams have had close games since their grand final encounters, with their matches often finishing within single digit margins.\n\n==VFL and AFL premierships==\n\n===Premiers===\n* 1909 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated Carlton 4.14 (38) to 4.12 (36)\n* 1918 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated Collingwood 9.8 (62) to 7.15 (57)\n* 1933 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated Richmond 9.17 (71) to 4.5 (29)\n* 2005 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated West Coast 8.10 (58) to 7.12 (54)\n* 2012 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated Hawthorn 14.7 (91) to 11.15 (81)\n\n===Defeated in grand finals===\n* 1899 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Fitzroy 3.9 (27) to 3.8 (26)\n* 1907 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Carlton 6.14 (50) to 6.9 (45)\n* 1912 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Essendon 5.17 (47) to 4.9 (33)\n* 1914 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Carlton 6.9 (45) to 4.15 (39)\n* 1934 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Richmond 19.14 (128) to 12.17 (89)\n* 1935 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Collingwood 11.12 (78) to 7.16 (58)\n* 1936 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Collingwood 11.23 (89) to 10.18 (78)\n* 1945 (as South Melbourne) \u2013 defeated by Carlton 15.13 (103) to 10.15 (75)\n* 1996 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated by North Melbourne 19.17 (131) to 13.10 (88); first grand final appearance after relocation\n* 2006 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated by West Coast 12.13 (85) to 12.12 (84)\n* 2014 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated by Hawthorn 21.11 (137) to 11.8 (74)\n* 2016 (as Sydney Swans) \u2013 defeated by Western Bulldogs 13.11 (89) to 10.7 (67)\n\n==Players and staff==\n\n===Current squad===\n{{Sydney Swans current squad}}\n\n===Officials===\n* '''Chairman:''' [[Andrew Pridham]]\n* '''Directors:'''\n** Andrew McMaster (Deputy chairman)\n** Rob Morgan\n** Alexandra Goodfellow\n** Greg Paramor\n** Robert Pascoe\n** Brian Tyson\n** Brad Seymour\n** Tim Worner\n* '''Chief executive:''' [[Tom Harley]]\n* '''general manager \u2013 Football:''' [[Charlie Gardiner (footballer)|Charlie Gardiner]]\n* '''Player Welfare & Development:''' [[Dennis Carroll]]\n\n==Reserves team==\n{{Main|Australian Football League reserves affiliations}}\nThe Swans currently field a reserves team in the [[North East Australian Football League]]. Previously a reserves team was first created for South Melbourne in 1919 and continued to compete in the Victorian reserves competition until 1999 despite the team relocating to Sydney in 1982. The team enjoyed little success in the Victorian competition; it was the only reserves team never to win a premiership, and its best performances were losing grand finals in 1927, 1956 and 1980. In 2000 the Swans entered a reserves team in the [[Sydney AFL]] competition but withdrew prior to the finals series because the club felt the difference in standard was too greatly in favour of the Swans. Between 2001 and 2002 the Swans affiliated themselves with the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League|VFL]] while also starting a new stand-alone team named the Redbacks in the Sydney AFL competition. Little success resulted and the Swans entered a stand-alone reserves team in the [[AFL Canberra]] competition in 2003 which resulted in four consecutive premierships between 2005 and 2008. In 2011 the Swans reserves team joined the North East Australian Football League with the rest of the AFL Canberra competition and now have regular matches against AFL reserve teams from the [[Brisbane Lions]], [[Gold Coast Suns]] and [[GWS Giants]]. The team plays home games at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] and will often play as a curtain raiser to senior AFL games.\n\nIn [[2011 NEAFL season|2011]] the Swans reserves finished the home and away season with the Eastern Conference minor premiership. In the Eastern Conference grand final [[Ainslie Football Club|Ainslie]] caused a major upset when they defeated the Swans by 52 points. The team suffered the same fate in [[2012 NEAFL season|2012]] when [[Queanbeyan Football Club|Queanbeyan]] defeated them by 30 points in the Eastern Conference grand final. The Swans reserves would then go on to play in an astonishing five losing NEAFL grand finals; 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display:inline-table;\"\n|+Premierships (4)\n|-\n!Year\n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Venue\n|-\n| [[2005 AFL Canberra season|2005]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''12.8 (80) \u2013 8.15 (63)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2006 AFL Canberra season|2006]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''10.16 (76) \u2013 6.7 (43)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2007 AFL Canberra season|2007]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Queanbeyan Football Club|Queanbeyan]] || '''18.14 (122) \u2013 14.10 (94)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2008 AFL Canberra season|2008]] || [[AFL Canberra]]|| [[Belconnen Football Club|Belconnen]] || '''11.4 (70) \u2013 9.15 (69)''' || [[Manuka Oval]]\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"display:inline-table;\"\n|+Runners-up (9)\n|-\n!Year\n!Competition\n!Opponent\n!Score\n!Venue\n|-\n| [[1927 VFL season|1927]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] || '''11.9 (75) \u2013 12.22 (94)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1956 VFL season|1956]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] || '''10.12 (72) \u2013 16.14 (110)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n| [[1980 VFL season|1980]]{{ref label|1|a}} || [[Victorian State Football League|VFL Reserves]]|| [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] || '''19.12 (126) \u2013 24.15 (159)''' || [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n|-\n|1995\n|AFL Reserves\n|North Melbourne\n|'''13.16 (94) - 11.14 (80)'''\n|MCG\n|-\n| [[2013 NEAFL season|2013]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Brisbane Lions]] || '''10.13 (73) \u2013 12.9 (81)''' || [[Graham Rd Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2014 NEAFL season|2014]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Aspley Australian Football Club|Aspley Hornets]] || '''15.10 (100) \u2013 15.12 (102)''' || [[Graham Rd Oval]]\n|-\n| [[2016 NEAFL season|2016]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Greater Western Sydney Football Club|WSU Giants]] || '''11.12 (78) \u2013 11.16 (82)''' || [[Blacktown International Sportspark]]\n|-\n| [[2017 NEAFL season|2017]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| [[Brisbane Lions]] || '''10.22 (82) \u2013 12.13 (85)''' || [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]\n|-\n| [[2018 NEAFL season|2018]] || [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]|| Southport {{ref label|1|b}}||'''14.6 (90) \u2013  5.5 (35)''' || [[Fankhauser Reserve]]\n|}\n{{note label|1|a}} Competed as South Melbourne.\n\n{{ref label|1|b}} In the final quarter with Southport leading 76 - 16, Southport were found to have 19 men on the field.

(SAFF)\n\n==Media coverage==\n\n===Print===\n\nThe Sydney Swans receive regular exposure from Sydney's two major daily newspapers, [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]], the [[Sydney Morning Herald]] and their respective counterpart publications, [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]] and [[The Sun-Herald]]. Articles about the Swans can occasionally be found in local community newspapers, free magazines and Sydney street press publications.\n\n===Radio===\n\nThe Sydney Swans are sponsored by radio station [[2MMM|Triple M]] which broadcasts all of its games, including finals, live. Occasionally, [[702 ABC Sydney]] may cover Swans matches if they are played on a Saturday afternoon, regardless of where they are playing. If they play in Sydney during that time schedule, appropriately 702 ABC Sydney will cover the match. Matches played at other times and days are broadcast on the [[ABC NewsRadio]] station's analogue AM/FM frequencies for listeners in Sydney, Newcastle, the NSW Central Coast and Canberra. Most Swans matches can be heard by listeners in the Riverina region of N.S.W. via the [[ABC Riverina]] \u2013 [[Wagga Wagga]] ([[2RVR]]) service, on the 675 AM frequency. Match coverage can be heard anywhere in the world via live streaming at the official AFL website or by downloading the AFL app for smartphones such as the [[iPhone]] and [[Samsung Galaxy]].\n\n===Television===\n\nFrom 2002 to 2011 [[Network Ten]] televised all Swans games played in Melbourne and outside [[New South Wales]] live, but on a half-hour delay when played in Sydney for Sydney viewers and via affiliated stations in N.S.W and [[Canberra]]. In past and recent years the [[Seven Network]] broadcast Swans games to viewers in Sydney and most of N.S.W. and Canberra via the Prime TV network (now branded as [[Prime7]]). Matches were telecast either live, on a 30\u201390-minute delayed broadcast or late-night replay. Commencing 2002 all their games were broadcast live or on same day delay by Subscription television provider [[Foxtel]] across Australia on either the [[Fox Footy Channel]] or [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] channels.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2016, the AFL commenced a new broadcast deal requiring the [[Seven Network]] and their affiliate station [[Prime7]] to broadcast all Sydney Swans (and [[Greater Western Sydney Giants]]) games live to viewers in Sydney and most of regional [[New South Wales]] and [[Canberra]].

Established in [[Melbourne]] as the '''South Melbourne Football Club''' in 1874, the Swans relocated to [[Sydney]] in 1982, thus making it the first club in the competition to be based outside [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\nInitially playing in the [[Victorian Football League|Victorian Football Association]] (VFA), the Swans joined seven other clubs in founding the breakaway Victorian Football League (now known as the AFL) in 1896. It won premierships in [[1909 VFL Grand Final|1909]], [[1918 VFL Grand Final|1918]] and [[1933 VFL Grand Final|1933]] before experiencing a 72-year premiership drought\u2014the longest in the competition's history. The club broke the drought in [[2005 AFL Grand Final|2005]] and won another premiership in [[2012 AFL season|2012]].\n\nThe club has proven to be one of the most consistent teams in the AFL era, failing to make the finals in only four seasons since [[1995 AFL season|1995]], playing the most number of finals matches and winning the second-most matches overall (only behind {{AFL Gee}}) since 2000 and boasting a finals winning record of over 50% in the same time period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uKBlqPdAo0WO-F_PQzFLuRX-TDz7xsg7TFb-gQ1C3F0/pubhtml?gid=388289766&single=true|title=AFL Finals Summary All Clubs 2000\u20132015|accessdate=9 November 2015|location=Google Docs|first=Justin|last=Mitchell|year=2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/2017-02-06/which-was-the-best-club-since-2000|title=Which was the best club since 2000?|work=Staff writers|publisher=Australian Football League|date=6 February 2017|accessdate=6 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Swans' headquarters and training facilities are located at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]], the club's playing home ground since 1982.\n\n==South Melbourne history==\n[[File:Smfc.png|thumb|Old South Melbourne Football Club shield.

The other clubs were [[St Kilda Football Club]], [[Essendon Football Club]], [[Fitzroy Football Club]], [[Melbourne Football Club]], [[Geelong Football Club]], [[Carlton Football Club]] and [[Collingwood Football Club]].\n\n===VFL entry: 1897\u20131909===\nSouth Melbourne was one of the original founding clubs of the [[Victorian Football League (1897\u20131989)|Victorian Football League]] that was formed in 1897.\n\n===Premiership success: 1909\u20131945===\nThe club had early success and won three VFL premierships in 1909, 1918 and 1933. The club was at its most successful in the 1930s, when key recruits from both Victoria and interstate led to a string of appearances in the finals, including four successive grand final appearances from 1933 to 1936, albeit with only one premiership in 1933.  The collection of players recruited from interstate in 1932/1933 became known as South Melbourne's \"Foreign Legion\".<ref>The caricature at the foot of [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/149547747/17704724 page 10 of ''Table Talk'' (22 June 1933)] was created by Richard \"Dick\" Ovenden (1897\u20131972).

Ironically, the truck driver was a South Melbourne supporter.<ref>Shaw, I.W. (2006) ''The Bloodbath''. Scribe Publications.</ref>\n\nIt was during this period that the team became known as the Swans. The nickname, which was suggested by a [[Herald and Weekly Times]] artist in 1933, was inspired by the number of Western Australians in the team (the [[black swan]] being the state emblem of Western Australia), and was formally adopted by the club before the following season 1934.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sporting Globe|date=24 January 1934|location=Melbourne|title=Real story behind South Melbourne's football premiership|page=7|author=J. M. Rohan}}</ref> The name stuck, in part due to the club's association with nearby [[Albert Park and Lake]], also known for its [[swan]]s (although there are no longer any non-native white swans and only black, indigenous swans in the lake).\n\nAfter several years with only limited success, South Melbourne next reached the grand final in 1945. The match, played against Carlton, was to become known as \"the Bloodbath\", courtesy of the brawl that overshadowed the match, with a total of 9 players being reported by the umpires. Carlton won the match by 28 points, and from then on, South Melbourne struggled.\n\n===Struggling times: 1946\u20131981===\nIn the following years, South Melbourne consistently struggled, as their traditional inner-city recruiting district largely emptied as a result of demographic shifts. The club missed the finals in 1946 and continued to fall such that by 1950 they were second-last on the ladder. They nearly made the finals in 1952, but from 1953 to 1969, they never finished higher than eighth on the ladder. By the 1960s it was clear that South Melbourne's financial resources would not be capable of allowing them to compete in the growing market for country and interstate players, and their own local zone was never strong enough to compensate for this. The introduction of country [[zoning (Australian rules football)|zoning]] failed to help, as the [[Riverina Football League]] proved to be one of the least profitable zones.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1981, South Melbourne made the finals only twice: under legendary coach [[Norm Smith]], South Melbourne finished fourth in 1970, but lost the first semi-final; and, in 1977, the club finished fifth under coach Ian Stewart, but lost the elimination final. In that time, they \"won\" three [[Wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoons]]. Between Round 7, 1972 and Round 13, 1973, the team lost 29 consecutive games. By the end of the 1970s South Melbourne were saddled with massive debts after struggling for such a long period of time.\n\n==Sydney history==\n{{recentism|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Early years in Sydney: 1982\u20131987===\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the VFL was strategically interested in seeing a club based in Sydney, as part of a long-term plan to broaden the appeal of the game in [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]. The league had started moving a few premiership matches to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] annually since 1979, and in 1981 was preparing to establish an entirely new, 13th VFL club in Sydney after the [[Fitzroy Lions]] staved off a proposed relocation to become the Sydney Lions in late 1980. These plans halted when the South Melbourne board, recognising the difficulties it faced with viability and financial stability in Melbourne, made the decision to play all 1982 home games in Sydney. The club had been operating at a loss of at least $150,000 for the previous five years. News of the proposal broke on 2 July 1981, after which a letter was sent to members outlining the board's reasons for making the proposal and noting that the coach and current players were in favour of the move.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2019-07-02/on-this-day-swans-move-to-sydney|title=On This Day: Swans move to Sydney|website=sydneyswans.com.au|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> On 29 July 1981, the VFL formally accepted the proposal, and paved the way for the Swans to shift to Sydney in 1982.\n\nThe move caused great internal difficulties, as a group of supporters known as Keep South at South campaigned throughout the rest of 1981 to stop the move; and, at an [[extraordinary general meeting]] on 22 September, the group democratically took control of the club's board. However, the new board did not have the power to unilaterally stop the move to Sydney: under the VFL constitution, to rescind the decision that had been made on 29 July required a three-quarters majority in a vote of all twelve clubs, and at a meeting on 14 October it failed to obtain this majority.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|title=VFL 'no' sends South to Sydney|author=Mike Coward|date=15 October 1981|page=32}}</ref> The new board also lacked the support of the players, the vast majority of whom were in favour of a long-term move to Sydney; in early November, after the board promised that it would try to bring the club back to Melbourne in 1983, the players went on strike, seeking to force the new board commit to Sydney in the long term as well as seeking payments that the cash-strapped club owed them from the previous season.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|location=Melbourne|page=40|author=Geoff Slattery|date=7 November 1981|title=South Players on strike}}</ref> The board ended up undermining its own position when it accepted a $400,000 loan from the VFL in late November to stay solvent, under the condition that it commit to Sydney for two years. Finally, in early December, the Keep South at South board resigned and a board in favour of the move to Sydney was installed.<ref name=\"saga\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Roar|title=Revisiting the South Melbourne to Sydney saga|date=6 July 2012|url=http://www.theroar.com.au/2012/07/06/the-south-to-sydney-saga/|accessdate=7 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1982 Escort Championships|1982 Escort Championships Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  {{AFL Swa}}|| '''13''' ||'''12''' ||'''90'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  {{AFL Nor}} || 8 || 10 || 58\n|-\n| Venue: [[Waverley Park]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 20,028\n|}\n\nUpon moving, the club played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In 1982, the club was technically a Melbourne-based club which played all of its home games in Sydney; it dropped the name \"South Melbourne\" in June 1982, becoming known as simply \"the Swans\" for the rest of that season.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|location=Melbourne|first=Peter|last=Simunovich|title=The Swans \u2013 officially|date=3 June 1982|page=67}}</ref> It was not until 1983 that the club formally moved its operations to Sydney and became the Sydney Swans.<ref name=\"saga\" /> Its physical \"home club\" was the \"Southern Cross Social Club\" at 120a Clovelly Road, Randwick, New South Wales which became bankrupt in 1987; new Sydney Swans Offices were then set up in the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].\n\n[[File:Sydney80s.png|frame|left|Sydney 1980s shield logo]]\n\nOn 31 July 1985, for what was thought to be [[Australian dollar|$]]6.3&nbsp;million, [[Geoffrey Edelsten]] \"bought\" the Swans; in reality it was $2.9&nbsp;million in cash with funding and other payments spread over five years. Edelsten resigned as chairman in less than twelve months, but had already made his mark. He immediately recruited former Geelong coach [[Tom Hafey]]. Hafey, in turn, used his knowledge of Geelong's contracts to recruit [[David Bolton (Australian footballer)|David Bolton]], [[Bernard Toohey]] and [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)|Greg Williams]], who would all form a key part of the Sydney side, at a league-determined total fee of $240,000 (less than the $500,000 Geelong demanded and even the $300,000 Sydney offered).<ref>Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', page 91. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995</ref> The likes of [[Gerard Healy]], [[Merv Neagle]] and [[Paul Morwood]] were also poached from other clubs, and failed approaches were made to [[Simon Madden]], [[Terry Daniher]], [[Andrew Bews]] and [[Maurice Rioli]].<ref>Williams, Greg: ''Diesel: The Greg Williams Story'', p. 93. Pan MacMillan Australia, 1995</ref>\n\nDuring the Edelsten years, the Swans were seen by the Sydney public as a flamboyant club, typified by the style of its spearhead, [[Warwick Capper]], his long bright blond [[mullet (hairstyle)|mullet]] and bright pink boots made him unmissable on the field and his pink Lamborghini, penchant for fashion models and eccentricity made him notorious off the field \u2013 all somewhat [[1980s in fashion|fashionable in the 1980s]]. During Capper's peak years, the Swans had made successive finals appearances for the first time since relocating. His consistently spectacular aerial exploits earned him consecutive [[Mark of the Year]] awards while his goalkicking efforts (amassing 103 goals in 1987) made him runner up in the Coleman Medal two years running. The Swans\u2019 successive finals appearances saw crowds during this time peak at an average of around 25,000 per game. Edelsten also introduced the \"Swanettes\", becoming the sole such cheerleading group among VFL teams following the disbandment of Carlton's Blue Birds in 1986. The Swanettes did not get much performance time, owing to the short intervals between quarters of play in the VFL and the lack of space in which they might perform while other activities take place on the field. The Swanettes were soon discontinued and no club has had cheerleaders since then.\n\nIn 1987, the Swans scored 201 points against the [[West Coast Eagles]] and the following week scored 236 points against the [[Essendon Football Club]]. Both games were at the SCG. The Swans remain one of only two clubs to have scored consecutive team tallies above 200 points, the only other being Geelong in 1992.<ref>[[1992 AFL season]]</ref> However, this was followed by several heavy losses, including defeat by Hawthorn by 99 points in the Qualifying Final and by 76 points against Melbourne in the First Semi-final.\n\n===Dark times: 1988\u20131994===\nThe club's form was to slump in the following year.\n\nLosses were in the millions. A group of financial backers including [[Mike Willesee]], Basil Sellers, Peter Weinert and Craig Kimberley purchased the licence and bankrolled the club until 1993, when the AFL stepped in.\n\nMorale at the side plummeted as players were asked to take pay cuts.<ref>[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie rules for dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008), p.128</ref> Legendary coach [[Tom Hafey]] was sacked by the club in 1988 after a player-led rebellion at his tough training methods (unusual in the semi-professional days of that era).\n\nCapper was sold to the Brisbane Bears for $400,000 in a desperate attempt to improve the club's finances. Instead, it only led to disastrous on-field performances. Instead of a 100-goal-a-season forward, Sydney's goalkicking was led by [[Bernard Toohey]] (usually a defender) with 29 in 1989, then Jim West with 34 in 1990.

The nadir came with three consecutive wooden spoons in 1992, 1993 and 1994.\n\nThe AFL stepped in to save the Swans, offering substantial monetary and management support. The club survived, despite strong rumours in 1992 that it would merge with the [[Brisbane Bears]] to form a combined New South Wales/Queensland team, fold altogether, or even move back to South Melbourne.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} With draft and salary cap concessions in the early 1990s and a series of notable recruits, the team became competitive after the early part of the decade.\n\nDuring this time, the side was largely held together by two inspirational skippers, both from the [[Wagga Wagga]] region of country New South Wales, [[Dennis Carroll]] and later the courageous captain [[Paul Kelly (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Kelly]].\n\nDesperate to hang on, the club was keen to enlist the biggest names and identities in the AFL, and recruited legendary coach [[Ron Barassi]] who helped save the club from extinction while serving them as coach from Round 7, 1993 to 1995. At roughly the same time, Hawthorn legend [[Dermott Brereton]] was also recruited, albeit with little on-field impact. On a much brighter side for the Swans, their captain Paul Kelly won the League's highest individual honour, the [[Brownlow Medal]], in 1995.\n\n===Tony Lockett and grand final return: 1995\u20132001===\nA big coup for the club was recruitment of [[St Kilda Football Club]] champion [[Tony Lockett|Tony \"Plugger\" Lockett]] in 1995. Lockett became a cult figure in Sydney, with an instant impact and along with the [[Super League war]] in the dominant rival [[rugby league]] football code in Australia, helped the Swans to become a powerhouse Sydney icon.\n\n1995 would be Barassi's last year in charge. The Swans won eight games \u2013 as many as they did in the previous three seasons combined \u2013 and finished with a percentage of over 100 (in fact, they have managed such consistently ever since). They were also one of only two teams to defeat the all-conquering Carlton side of that year. Swans great Paul Kelly also won the [[Brownlow Medal]] that year. Barassi left an improving team, a club in a much better state than he found them.\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1996 AFL season|1996 AFL Home & Away Season]]'' || ''W'' || ''L'' || ''D'' ||''Total'' || ''%''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  '''Sydney Swans''' || '''16''' || '''5''' || '''1''' || '''66''' || '''123.9'''\n|-\n|\n| colspan=9 | ''Minor Premiers''\n|}\n\nFormer Hawthorn player Rodney Eade took over the reins in 1996 and after a slow start (they lost their first two games of the season), turned the club around into powerful force. The Swans ended the minor round on top of the premiership table with 16 wins, 5 losses, and 1 draw. In the finals, the Swans won one of the most thrilling AFL preliminary finals in history after Plugger Lockett kicked a behind after the siren to win the game. The Swans lost the grand final to {{AFL Nor}}, which had been their first appearance in a grand final since 1945. The game was played in front of 93,102 at the [[MCG]].\n\nThe Swans then made the finals for four of the next five full years that Rodney Eade was in charge. In 1998 they finished 3rd on the AFL ladder; despite beating {{AFL StK}} in their first final the Swans were then beaten by eventual premiers {{AFL Ade}} in the semi-final at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]].\n\nThe 1999 season was a largely uneventful year for the club, the only real highlight being [[Tony Lockett]] kicking his record-breaking 1300th goal against {{AFL Col}} in Round 10. The 1999 season ended with a 69-point mauling at the hands of minor premiers {{AFL Ess}}.\n\nAfter missing the finals in [[2000 AFL season|2000]], the Swans rebounded to finish 7th in [[2001 AFL season|2001]], but were beaten by {{AFL Haw}} by 55 points in their elimination final at [[Colonial Stadium]].\n\n===Rebuilding and finals return: 2002\u20132004===\nFormer Swans favourite son [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]] was appointed caretaker coach midway through the 2002 season, replacing Rodney Eade who was removed after Round 12. Roos won six of the remaining 10 games that year (including the last four of the season) and was installed as the permanent coach from the 2003 season onwards, despite rumors that Sydney had nearly concluded a deal with [[Terry Wallace]].\n\nRoos continued a record as a successful coach with the Swans for the eight full seasons that would follow.\n\nA new home ground in [[ANZ Stadium]] (then known as Telstra Stadium) provided increased capacity over the SCG. The Swans' first game played at the Stadium in Round 9, 2002 against {{AFL Ess}} attracted 54,169 spectators. The Sydney Swans v [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] match on 23 August 2003 set an attendance record for the largest crowd to watch an AFL game outside of Victoria with an official attendance of 72,393 and was the largest home and away AFL crowd at any stadium for 2003. A preliminary final against the [[Brisbane Lions]] in 2003 attracted 71,019 people. The Swans lost all three of those significant matches.\n\n2004 saw an average year for Sydney, however one highlight was when they ended {{AFL StK}}'s undefeated start to the season in Round 11. The match was notable for [[Leo Barry]]'s effort in nullifying the impact of St Kilda full-forward and eventual [[Coleman Medal]]list [[Fraser Gehrig]], whom Barry restricted to only two possessions for the entire match.\n\nSydney was able to recruit another St Kilda export in the Lockett mould, [[Barry Hall]]. There were obvious parallels to the signing of Lockett (a powerful, tough forward from St Kilda with questions over his discipline and attitude), which left Hall with much to live up to. He flourished in his new surroundings and eventually became a cult figure and club leader in his own right.\n\nAs the new century dawned, Sydney implemented a policy of giving up high order draft picks in exchange for players who struggled at other clubs. It was during this era that the Swans picked up the likes of [[Paul Williams (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Williams]], [[Barry Hall]], [[Craig Bolton]], [[Darren Jolly]], [[Ted Richards]], [[Peter Everitt]], [[Martin Mattner]], [[Rhyce Shaw]], [[Shane Mumford]], [[Ben McGlynn]] and [[Mitch Morton]], amongst others, and giving up higher order draft picks meant the Swans missed out on the likes of [[Daniel Motlop]], [[Nick Dal Santo]], [[James Kelly (Australian footballer)|James Kelly]], [[Courtenay Dempsey]] and [[Sam Lonergan]] who went to {{AFL Por}}, {{AFL StK}}, {{AFL Gee}} and the latter two to {{AFL Ess}} respectively. This policy is said to have paid off in the Roos era, as they implemented a strict culture of discipline at the club.\n\n===Premiership glory: 2005===\n{{Main|2005 AFL Grand Final}}\n{{Wikinews|Sydney Swans win AFL premiership after 72 years in classic match}}\nIn 2005, the Swans came under enormous public scrutiny, even from AFL CEO [[Andrew Demetriou]], for their unorthodox, \"boring\" defense-oriented tactics that included tightly controlling the tempo of the game and starving the opposition of possession (in fact, seven teams that season had their lowest possession total whilst playing against the Swans). Swans coach [[Paul Roos (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Roos]] maintained that playing contested football was the style used by all recent Premiership-winning teams, and felt that it was ironic that the much criticised strategy proved ultimately successful.\n\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n|width=35%\n|align=right\n|quote=Nick Davis!

This dropped them into a semi-final against the [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong Cats]] at the SCG on 9 September, and the Swans trailed the Cats 31\u201353 before [[Nick Davis (footballer)|Nick Davis]] kicked four consecutive goals, with the last one a matter of seconds before the siren, to win the game for Sydney by 7.14 (56) to 7.11 (53). In the first preliminary final at the MCG on 16 September against [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], the Swans used a seven-goal blitz in 11 minutes of the fourth quarter to overturn an 8-point deficit and overrun the Saints by 15.6 (96) to 9.11 (65).\n\nThe Swans faced the Eagles in a rematch in the [[AFL Grand Final]] on 24 September 2005, and this time, they prevailed by four points, final score 8.10 (58) to West Coast's 7.12 (54). In the last few minutes, the Sydney defence held strong, with [[Leo Barry]] marking the ball just before the siren to stop the Eagles' final desperate shot at goal. The Premiership was the Swans' first in 72 years and their first since being based in Sydney. It was also the fifth Premiership in succession to be won by a team from outside [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px No. 000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[2005 AFL Grand Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  '''Sydney Swans''' || '''8''' || '''10''' || '''58'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[West Coast Eagles]] || 7  || 12 || 54\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 91,898\n|}\n\nOn Friday, 30 September 2005, a [[ticker tape parade]] down Sydney's [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] was held in honour of the Swans' achievements, which ended with a rally at [[Town Hall]], where Sydney [[Lord Mayor of Sydney|Lord Mayor]] [[Clover Moore]] presented the team with the key to the city.

It was their earliest exit from the finals since 2001 and was a culmination of a mostly disappointing season, as only victories against lesser teams saw them through to a fifth consecutive finals campaign.\n\nThe conclusion of the 2007 trade saw the loss of [[Adam Schneider]] and [[Sean Dempster]] to [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]], the delisting of [[Simon Phillips (footballer)|Simon Phillips]], Jonathan Simpkin and [[Luke Vogels]], and the gain of [[Henry Playfair]] from [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and [[Martin Mattner]] from [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]].\n\n[[File:Sydney banner honouring Amon Buchanon and Paul Roos.jpg|thumb|A Sydney Swans banner honouring Amon Buchanon's 100th game as a player [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]]' 500th game as player and coach]]\n\nThe Swans spent the middle part of the 2008 season inside the top four, however a late form slump which yielded only three wins in the last nine rounds saw the Swans drop to sixth at the conclusion of the 2008 regular season. Having qualified for the finals for a sixth consecutive season, the Swans defeated {{AFL Nor}} in the elimination final before losing to the [[Western Bulldogs]] the following week.\n\n2009 saw the club register only eight victories as they failed to reach the finals for the first time since 2002, finishing 12th with a percentage of below 100% for the first time since 1994. [[Barry Hall]], [[Leo Barry]], [[Jared Crouch]], [[Michael O'Loughlin]], [[Amon Buchanan]] and [[Darren Jolly]] all departed at the conclusion of the season, with [[Mark Seaby]], [[Daniel Bradshaw]] and [[Shane Mumford]], among others, joining the club during the trade period.\n\nThe 2010 season saw Sydney return to the finals by virtue of a fifth-place finish at the end of the regular season. The club defeated {{AFL Car}} by five points in the elimination final before losing to the [[Western Bulldogs]] in the semi-finals for the second time in three seasons.

The Swans defeated {{AFL StK}} in an elimination final at [[Docklands Stadium]] before losing to {{AFL Haw}} in the semi-finals the following week.\n\nIt was during the regular season that the Swans caused the upset of the season, defeating the star-studded [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong Cats]] on its home ground, [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Skilled Stadium]], where the home tenant had won its past 29 games in succession, and its past two matches at the ground by a combined margin of 336 points, in Round 23. It was the Swans' first win over the Cats since 2006 and its first win at the ground since Round 8, 1999. The Swans were also the only team to defeat the [[West Coast Eagles]] at [[Subiaco Oval|Patersons Stadium]] during the regular season. The Swans' victory over Geelong was overshadowed by the news that co-captain [[Jarrad McVeigh]]'s baby daughter had died in the week leading up to the match, forcing him to miss that match.\n\n[[File:Sydney Swans banner.jpg|thumb|right|Sydney Swans players run through the banner before the inaugural Sydney Derby on 24 March 2012.]]\nThe 2012 season began for the Swans with the inaugural Sydney Derby against AFL newcomers {{AFL GWS}}.

In 2014 the Swans were minor premiers, and also qualified for the [[2014 AFL Grand Final]]. They defeated [[Fremantle Dockers|Fremantle]] at home in the first qualifying final in Round one of the finals series and so earned a one-week break. In the first preliminary final the Swans had a convincing win against [[North Melbourne Kangaroos|North Melbourne]], which led them to their fourth grand final in 10 years. The [[2014 AFL Grand Final]] was played on Saturday 27 September 2014 in near perfect weather conditions, with Sydney seen as favourites leading up to the match. This was the first time in a finals series that former Hawk player [[Lance Franklin]] would play against his former team, one of very few players to have played back to back grand finals for two different teams. The Hawks dominated the game quite early and eventually defeated the Swans 11.8.(74) to 21.11.(137). The 63-point loss was Sydney's biggest ever loss in a grand final and their biggest defeat all season, meaning Hawthorn would become back to back premiers for the second time in their history.\n\nThe Swans started the 2015 AFL season well, winning their first three, before losing their next 2 games against [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]], where they trailed by as many as 8 goals before half-time, and the [[Western Bulldogs]].

This allowed the Swans to trade for [[Callum Sinclair]] in a swap deal,<ref>[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-10-14/eagles-swans-agree-to-straight-sinclairjetta-swap], AFL.com.au official website, 14 October 2015</ref> as well as trade a late pick for out-of-contract defender, [[Michael Talia]] from the Western Bulldogs.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-trade-period-2015-former-bulldog-michael-talia-moves-to-swans-in-lastminute-trade-deal-20151022-gkfzhi.html], ''The Age'', 22 October 2015</ref>\n\nThe Swans started off the 2016 season with a convincing 80-point round 1 win against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]], with new Swans recruit [[Michael Talia]] suffering a long term foot injury. They followed up the next round with a 60-point win against the Blues, with new recruit [[Callum Sinclair]] kicking 3 goals. The following week they defeated GWS by 25 points, with [[Lance Franklin]] kicking 4 goals. In the following match against the Crows, [[Isaac Heeney]] starred with 18 touches and 4 goals in a losing side. Three more wins followed, against West Coast, Brisbane and Essendon respectively before a shock loss to Richmond in round 8 by a solitary point, after a kick after the siren. They bounced back to win against top spot North Melbourne, and the Hawks at the MCG, with Lance Franklin booting 3 goals, including a bomb from 80 metres. After a tight slog against the Suns, the Swans played the Giants once more and were defeated in the club's 100th game. They won their next game by 55 points against the Demons, in a fourth quarter breeze. After a bye in Round 14, the Sydney Swans lost their first game after, again with the last kick of the game, by 4 points. The week after was soured by a family feud involving co-captain [[Kieren Jack]] and his parents, after they were reportedly told by him not to come to is 200-game milestone. After the spat, Jack led the Swans to an emphatic upset victory against Geelong, booting 3 goals and gathering 24 possessions in the one-sided 38-point victory at Simonds Stadium. They then travelled back home where they faced Hawthorn and lost their 3rd match of the season by under a goal, as Buddy went goalless for the first time in the season. After an unconvincing win the following week against Carlton, the Swans went on to win their last 5 home and away games by a combined total of 349 points, giving them top spot and a home qualifying final.\n\nAhead of their first final against cross-town rivals the Giants, the Swans confirmed that they would play all home finals at the SCG except for Sydney Derbies, which would be played at ANZ Stadium. The final would create history, being the first Sydney Derby to be played in a final. It was also the first time that the Giants would make the finals in their fifth year. In a low-scoring first half, the Swans were very competitive, trailing by only 2 points. However, a mark not paid to Isaac Heeney midway through the third quarter turned all the momentum the Giants way, as they kicked away to win by 36 points. The Swans only kicked 2 goals after half-time with Giant [[Jeremy Cameron]] outscoring them in the third quarter alone with 3 goals. They were quick to bounce back the following week, thumping the [[Adelaide Crows]] by 6 goals, with Franklin and [[Tom Papley]] kicking 4 goals a piece, after a blistering 7 goal to 1 quarter. The story was pretty much the same in the preliminary final against the [[Geelong Cats]] at the MCG. The Swans kept the Cats goalless for the first quarter, and were never really challenged in their 37-point triumph. It would take them to their third grand final in 5 years, against the Western Bulldogs at the MCG. After leading by a scant 2-point margin at half time, the Bulldogs pulled away towards the end of the fourth quarter to hand Sydney their second grand final loss in three years.\n\nThe Swans began the 2017 season with six straight losses, after being upset at home by Port Adelaide in the opening round, they were upset by Collingwood and Carlton, and suffered defeats to the Western Bulldogs, Greater Western Sydney (who won their first game at the SCG) and West Coast Eagles (in Perth). However, they managed to win 13 of their last 15, losing both their games to [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] by 1 goal. Some of their best wins include against the reigning premiers the Bulldogs, GWS, and comeback wins against Richmond and Essendon. After becoming the first grand-finalist to lose their first six games, they have become the first team to reach the finals after starting the season 0\u20136. They would comprehensively defeat Essendon in their first final, before slumping to an ugly defeat against Geelong, ending their season.\n\nThe Swans had an indifferent 2018, compounded by their struggles at home, losing 5 out of 11 games at the SCG. A lean patch of form which included upset losses to Gold Coast (for the first time ever) and Essendon (for the first time since 2011) had them looking likely to miss finals altogether. However three out of four wins in the last four rounds was enough to see them into their ninth consecutive finals series, where they were comprehensively beaten by GWS in the Elimination Final.\n\nThe Swans' golden era of finals appearances came to an end in 2019. They missed the finals for the first time in a decade, finishing 15th on the ladder with eight wins and 14 losses. They started the season poorly with just one win in their first seven matches, although they would briefly recover after winning five of the next seven games. Six losses on the trot ended any chance of a tenth consecutive finals appearance, but strong wins over also-rans Melbourne and St Kilda in the final two rounds ensured the season ended on a positive note.\n\nThey won their first match of the interrupted 2020 season against Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval by three points.\n\n==Club identity==\n\n===Guernsey===\nThe jumper is white with a red back and a red yoke with a silhouette of the [[Sydney Opera House]] at the point of the yoke. The Opera House design was first used at the start of the 1987 season, replacing the traditional red \"V\" on white design. Until 1991, the back of the jumper was white with the yoke only extending to the back of the shoulders and each side of the jumper had a red vertical stripe. The current predominantly red design appeared at the start of the 1992 season. The club's major sponsor is [[QBE Insurance]]. In 2004 the club added the initials 'SMFC' in white lettering at the back of the collar to honour the club's past as South Melbourne Football Club. The move was welcomed by Melbourne-based fans. The clash guernsey is a predominantly white version of the home guernsey similar to the original Opera House guernsey design, including a white back, but it is rarely used, since the two Queensland clubs (the [[Brisbane Lions]] and [[Gold Coast Football Club|Gold Coast Suns]]) and cross town rivals [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|GWS Giants]] are the only clubs with which there is a clash.<ref>[http://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/2012-10-31/swans-2013-fixture-released Swans 2013 fixture released], Sydney Swans official website, 31 October 2012</ref>\n\n[[International Sports Clothing|ISC]] have manufactured the Swans' apparel since [[2010 AFL season|2010]], replacing long-time sponsor [[Puma SE|Puma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131104222641/http://www.isc-sports.com.au/about-isc/history/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-11-04|title=ISC 2018 COMING SOON|website=www.isc-sports.com.au}}</ref>\n\n====Uniform evolution====\nSince the club was called \"South Melbourne\", the team has worn different designs with the traditional red and white colors, as follows:<ref>[https://www.footyjumpers.com/seasons.htm VFL Uniforms by season (since 1897)] on FootyJumpers.com</ref>\n{|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _thinwhitehoops|pattern_so= _hoops_white|body= 002D62 |shorts= 002D62|socks= 002D62|title= 1874\u20131879}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _thinwhitehoops|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000 |shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1880-1904}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _3whitestripes|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1905\u201306}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redrightsash|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1907-11 & 13-31}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redleftsash|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 002D62|socks= ffffff|title= 1912}}\n|}\n{|\n|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= |pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= |socks= ffffff|title= 1920-1922}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n| pattern_b = _Vonwhite|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= 000000|socks= ffffff|title= 1932\u201374}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n| pattern_b = _Vonwhite|pattern_so= _hoops_red|body= ff0000|shorts= ff0000|socks= ffffff|title= 1975\u201386}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _swans19h|pattern_so= |body= ffffff|shorts= ff0000|socks= ff0000|title= 1987\u20132005}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _swans19h|pattern_so= _hoops_red |body= ffffff|shorts= ff0000|socks= |title= 2006\u2013present}}\n|}\n\n===Song===\nThe club song is known as ''Cheer, Cheer The Red and The White''' and is to the tune of the ''[[Victory March (fight song)|Victory March]]'', the fight song of the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] in South Bend, Indiana, USA, which was written by [[University of Notre Dame]] graduates and brothers Rev. Michael J. Shea and John F. Shea.

Previously a reserves team was first created for South Melbourne in 1919 and continued to compete in the Victorian reserves competition until 1999 despite the team relocating to Sydney in 1982. The team enjoyed little success in the Victorian competition; it was the only reserves team never to win a premiership, and its best performances were losing grand finals in 1927, 1956 and 1980. In 2000 the Swans entered a reserves team in the [[Sydney AFL]] competition but withdrew prior to the finals series because the club felt the difference in standard was too greatly in favour of the Swans. Between 2001 and 2002 the Swans affiliated themselves with the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League|VFL]] while also starting a new stand-alone team named the Redbacks in the Sydney AFL competition. Little success resulted and the Swans entered a stand-alone reserves team in the [[AFL Canberra]] competition in 2003 which resulted in four consecutive premierships between 2005 and 2008. In 2011 the Swans reserves team joined the North East Australian Football League with the rest of the AFL Canberra competition and now have regular matches against AFL reserve teams from the [[Brisbane Lions]], [[Gold Coast Suns]] and [[GWS Giants]]. The team plays home games at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] and will often play as a curtain raiser to senior AFL games.\n\nIn [[2011 NEAFL season|2011]] the Swans reserves finished the home and away season with the Eastern Conference minor premiership.

Morning Herald]] and their respective counterpart publications, [[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Sunday Telegraph]] and [[The Sun-Herald]]. Articles about the Swans can occasionally be found in local community newspapers, free magazines and Sydney street press publications.\n\n===Radio===\n\nThe Sydney Swans are sponsored by radio station [[2MMM|Triple M]] which broadcasts all of its games, including finals, live. Occasionally, [[702 ABC Sydney]] may cover Swans matches if they are played on a Saturday afternoon, regardless of where they are playing. If they play in Sydney during that time schedule, appropriately 702 ABC Sydney will cover the match. Matches played at other times and days are broadcast on the [[ABC NewsRadio]] station's analogue AM/FM frequencies for listeners in Sydney, Newcastle, the NSW Central Coast and Canberra. Most Swans matches can be heard by listeners in the Riverina region of N.S.W. via the [[ABC Riverina]] \u2013 [[Wagga Wagga]] ([[2RVR]]) service, on the 675 AM frequency. Match coverage can be heard anywhere in the world via live streaming at the official AFL website or by downloading the AFL app for smartphones such as the [[iPhone]] and [[Samsung Galaxy]].\n\n===Television===\n\nFrom 2002 to 2011 [[Network Ten]] televised all Swans games played in Melbourne and outside [[New South Wales]] live, but on a half-hour delay when played in Sydney for Sydney viewers and via affiliated stations in N.S.W and [[Canberra]]. In past and recent years the [[Seven Network]] broadcast Swans games to viewers in Sydney and most of N.S.W. and Canberra via the Prime TV network (now branded as [[Prime7]]). Matches were telecast either live, on a 30\u201390-minute delayed broadcast or late-night replay. Commencing 2002 all their games were broadcast live or on same day delay by Subscription television provider [[Foxtel]] across Australia on either the [[Fox Footy Channel]] or [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] channels.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2016, the AFL commenced a new broadcast deal requiring the [[Seven Network]] and their affiliate station [[Prime7]] to broadcast all Sydney Swans (and [[Greater Western Sydney Giants]]) games live to viewers in Sydney and most of regional [[New South Wales]] and [[Canberra]]. These games are screened on the [[7mate]] channel in these regions. [[Foxtel]] also signed a new broadcast deal for the 2012 \u2013 2016 seasons which included screening all AFL matches (including all Swans games) live across Australia on their [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] and [[Fox Footy]] channels.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Sports|Australia}}\n*[[:Category:Sydney Swans players|List of former and current Swans' players' entries]]\n*[[List of South Melbourne/Sydney Football Club coaches]] (includes their W/L records)\n*[[Australian rules football in New South Wales]]\n*[[Lake Oval]] \u2013 former home of the Swans\n*[[North East Australian Football League]] \u2013 Sydney Swans reserves fields a team in this competition.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{Cite book|author=Jim Main|title=Plugger and the Mighty Swans|publisher=Wilkinson Books|year=1996|isbn=1-86350-229-7|author-link=Jim Main}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.afl.com.au/ Official website of the AFL]\n*[http://sydneyswans.com.au/ Official website of the Sydney Swans Football Club]\n*[http://www.aroundthegrounds.bellestorie.com/lakeside/lakeside.html \"Around the Grounds\" web documentary about the Lakeside Oval]\n\n{{Sydney Swans}}\n{{VFL/AFL minor premiers}}\n{{VFL/AFL premiers}}\n{{Australian Football League}}\n{{NEAFL}}\n{{VFL}}\n{{Aussie Rules in New South Wales}}\n{{Sydney Sports Teams}}\n\n[[Category:Sydney Swans|*]]\n[[Category:Australian Football League clubs]]\n[[Category:Sports clubs established in 1874]]\n[[Category:Australian rules football clubs in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Former Victorian Football League clubs]]\n[[Category:1874 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sydney Cricket Ground]]\n[[Category:Sports team relocations]]\n", "name_user": "The-Pope", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:Moore Park#Sydney Swans and NSW Swifts\u2192Moore Park, New South Wales#Sydney Swans and NSW Swifts", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans"}

Ethnic involvement in organized crime gave rise to alien conspiracy theories in the US law enforcement community, in which the conception of organized crime as an alien and united entity was vital. The involvement of a small percentage of recent immigrants in organized crime created a lasting stereotype of devious immigrants corrupting the morality of native-born Americans.
