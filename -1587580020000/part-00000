'''''Alien Contamination''''') is a 1980 [[Science fiction film|science fiction]]-[[horror film]] directed by [[Luigi Cozzi]] and starring [[Ian McCulloch (actor)|Ian McCulloch]]. The film is about an alien cyclops creature that uses human agents to place eggs all over Earth. The eggs release a gelatinous goo that causes people to explode when they come into physical contact with the substance.\nThe tagline on the Italian one-sheet (\"...e ora tocca a voi!\") translates as \"...and now it's your turn!\".\n\n== Plot ==\n\nA large ship drifts into [[New York Harbor]], seemingly abandoned. The ship is discovered to be carrying large containers of coffee, hidden inside of which are a series of football-sized green eggs. The crew sent in to explore the ghost ship find the mutilated remains of the former crew gathered in one place, and they soon discover the reason why: when disturbed, the green eggs explode, spraying a viscous liquid over everything. The liquid is toxic to living creatures, and causes the body to immediately explode.\n\nThe military's answer to this phenomenon is Colonel Stella Holmes ([[Louise Marleau|Marleau]]). She establishes a link between the green eggs and a recent mission to Mars that ended badly for the two astronauts who descended to the planet. One of them disappeared, and the other, Commander Hubbard ([[Ian McCulloch (actor)|McCulloch]]), had a breakdown and subsequently became an alcoholic. When pressed, Hubbard agrees to help Holmes in her investigation of the insidious plot to bring the deadly eggs to Manhattan, and it takes them, along with sarcastic New York cop Tony Aris ([[Marino Mas\u00e9|Mas\u00e9]]), to a Colombian [[Economics of coffee|coffee plantation]]. All is not as it seems; Hubbard's former astronaut colleague is apparently alive and well and living under the influence of a monstrous alien cyclops, which is using mind control to further its plot to flood the world with the green eggs and wipe out human life on Earth.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Ian McCulloch (actor)|Ian McCulloch]] as Commander Ian Hubbard\n* [[Louise Marleau]] as Colonel Stella Holmes\n* [[Marino Mas\u00e9]] as Lieutenant Tony Aris, NYPD\n* [[Siegfried Rauch]] as Hamilton\n* [[Gisela Hahn]] as Perla de la Cruz\n* [[Carlo De Mejo]] as Agent Young\n* [[Carlo Monni]] as Dr. Turner\n* Mike Morris as Dr. Hilton\n* Martin Sorrentino as Black Warehouse Doorman\n* Angelo Ragusa as Warehouse Doorman\n* Brigitte Wagner as Doctor\n\n== Production ==\n\nAfter the success of his film ''[[Starcrash]]'', director [[Luigi Cozzi]] wanted to follow it up with another science fiction film.

Specifically, the film includes graphic depictions of human bodies exploding violently in slow motion, as well as the grisly remains of such explosions. While the explosion effects are not technically graphic (each of the exploding victims is encased in some kind of bulky costume that is obviously hiding the mechanism that sprays the gore), they are extremely bloody.{{fact|date=May 2016}}\n\nYears later, the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] classified the uncut version with a 15 certificate. It was released on home video in the United States under the titles ''Alien Contamination'' and ''Toxic Spawn'', which are both heavily edited.

The name was duly changed against Cozzi's wishes, with the producer also insisting on Cozzi developing more [[James Bond]]-style elements as opposed to his science fiction theme.<ref name=\"documentary\"/>\n\nThe film's production offices were in the same building as those used by the makers of ''[[Zombi 2]]'' and, impressed by the profits that film had made, Cozzi decided to try to hire the same cast members, although ultimately [[Ian McCulloch (actor)|Ian McCulloch]] was the only actor to work on ''Contamination''.<ref name=\"documentary\"/> Cozzi wanted to use [[Caroline Munro]] (who had been featured in ''Starcrash'') as Colonel Holmes but once again the producer overruled him and hired [[Louise Marleau]] instead.<ref name=\"documentary\"/>\n\n''Contamination'' was shot in eight weeks between 14 January and 4 March 1980.<ref name=\"filmportal\" /><ref name=\"documentary\"/> The film schedule included three weeks in Rome and then a further two weeks split between location shooting in [[New York City]], [[Florida]] and [[Colombia]].<ref name=\"documentary\"/> Cozzi had wanted to use animation or [[stop motion]] photography to realise the alien cyclops at the film's climax but was once again overruled by the producer, and an [[animatronic]] version was constructed instead.<ref name=\"documentary\"/> Cozzi subsequently claimed that this creature failed to work properly and would barely move, so he had to use rapid jump cuts to hide the fact that it was being pulled about by stagehands.<ref name=\"documentary\"/>\n\n== Release and controversy ==\n''Contamination'' was released in Germany on 9 May 1980, where it was distributed by Residenz-Film.<ref name=\"filmportal\" />\n\nAfter the [[Video Recordings Act 1984|Video Recordings Act]], ''Contamination'' was classed as a [[video nasty]]. Specifically, the film includes graphic depictions of human bodies exploding violently in slow motion, as well as the grisly remains of such explosions. While the explosion effects are not technically graphic (each of the exploding victims is encased in some kind of bulky costume that is obviously hiding the mechanism that sprays the gore), they are extremely bloody.{{fact|date=May 2016}}\n\nYears later, the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] classified the uncut version with a 15 certificate. It was released on home video in the United States under the titles ''Alien Contamination'' and ''Toxic Spawn'', which are both heavily edited. Cozzi later revealed that [[Cannon films|Cannon Films]], the film's North American distributor, had changed the name to ''Alien Contamination'' in order to capitalize on the popularity of Ridley Scott's [[Alien (film)|''Alien'']] (1979).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=Chris|date=|title=30 Years of Contamination|url=https://archive.org/details/Fangoria_296_2010/page/n69|journal=[[Fangoria]]|issue=296|pages=70\u201371, 80|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref> It is now available in the US in an unedited version which has been released on DVD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.melonfarmers.co.uk/nasties.htm |title=The Video Nasties List...Tabloid Hysteria |website=The Melon Farmer's Video Hits |accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hysteria-lives.co.uk/hysterialives/nasties/nastiesmain2.htm |title=Nasties |website=hysteria-lives.co.uk |accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Arrow Video]] released the film uncut on Blu-Ray in 2015.

The character debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 6 September 2006; his storylines have significantly revolved around his sexuality, evolving from the initial denial of his [[homosexuality]], to the pursuit and relations with best friend [[Craig Dean]] ([[Guy Burnet]]), the storyline gained a fan-base and garnered them \"[[supercouple]] status\". The storylines received acclaim from [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]] charity [[Stonewall (UK)|Stonewall]]. John Paul later has a relationship with a priest, [[Kieron Hobbs]] ([[Jake Hendriks]]). In 2008, Sutton quit the serial and his character received a \"sunset ending\" with Craig, which was promised for fans by executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]].\n\nSutton reprised the role in 2012 and John Paul returned on 18 December 2012, after leaving his role as [[Ryan Lamb (Emmerdale)|Ryan Lamb]] in ''[[Emmerdale]]''. Producers placed the character at the focus of a [[male rape]] story in 2014 when he is assaulted by a student, [[Finn O'Connor]] (Keith Rice). <!--Since his return, the character has been involved in: a failed marriage to [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]); being hospitalised due to a drink that was spiked with drugs; being involved in a train crash with his family, which ultimately killed his older sister [[Carmel McQueen]] ([[Gemma Merna]]); a drunken kiss with [[Harry Thompson (Hollyoaks)|Harry Thompson]] ([[Parry Glasspool]]) which months later, jeopardised his career; an affair with cousin-in-law, [[Lockie Campbell]] (Nick Rhys); getting estranged from his husband and striking up a friendship with transgender boss [[Sally St. Claire]] ([[Annie Wallace]]), and later finding out that she's his real father, a relationship with [[Scott Drinkwell]] ([[Ross Adams]]) and a one-night stand with [[James Nightingale (Hollyoaks)|James Nightingale]] ([[Gregory Finnegan]]).-->In early 2017, Sutton announced his intentions to leave the serial and the character departed on 9 March 2017. He reprised the role on 26 March 2019 for a cameo appearance, and four months later, it was announced that Sutton had reprised the role on a permanent basis. He returned on 9 December 2019 for two episodes to explore Finn's presence after his release, before returning permanently on 2 January 2020.\n\n==Storylines==\n===2006\u20132008===\nJohn Paul is the sixth eldest of [[Myra McQueen]]'s ([[Nicole Barber-Lane]]) eight children. He grew up around all women and was always the most level-headed of the group. John Paul meets [[Craig Dean]] ([[Guy Burnet]]) after saving him from a beating by [[Sonny Valentine]] ([[Devon Anderson]]). John Paul becomes close friends with Craig, [[Sarah Barnes]], ([[Loui Batley]]), [[Hannah Ashworth]] ([[Emma Rigby]]), and [[Nancy Hayton]] ([[Jessica Fox (actress)|Jessica Fox]]).\n\nJohn Paul and Hannah begin dating and they lose their virginity to each other. However, John Paul is clearly not as into Hannah as she is into him. After John Paul breaks up with Hannah, everyone mistakenly believes it is because he has feelings for Sarah, who is Craig's girlfriend. John Paul and Hannah later reconcile. At Hannah's 18th birthday party, John Paul emotionally confesses to Craig that he is in love with him. Afterwards, John Paul tells Craig he did not mean it and they agree to forget about it.\n\nCraig drunkenly kisses John Paul at a school dance-off competition. Hannah sees the kiss and announces it to the whole school. John Paul tells a devastated Hannah that he is gay. After Hannah's mother, [[Suzanne Ashworth|Suzanne]] ([[Suzanne Hall]]), tells Myra everything, she confronts John Paul about his sexuality. John Paul comes out to his family and while his sisters are supportive, Myra struggles with the revelation. John Paul also comes out to his friends and classmates, which leads to him being teased and bullied. Craig, not wanting to be perceived as gay, attacks John Paul physically. Craig apologises, but John Paul makes it clear they are no longer friends.\n\nJohn Paul and Craig later make up and become close again. John Paul begins dating a DJ named [[Spike (Hollyoaks)|Spike]] ([[Tom Vaughan (actor)|Tom Vaughan]]). Craig is jealous of all the time John Paul spends with Spike and John Paul tells him that he needs to accept his new relationship. Much to John Paul's surprise, Craig confesses he has feelings for him, too, and they sleep together. Afterwards, Craig pretends nothing happened between them. Eventually, they sleep together again and John Paul assumes this means Craig is going to come out. However, Craig tells John Paul that he is not gay, not finishing with Sarah, and wants to see John Paul on the side. John Paul is disgusted by the proposition at first, but he eventually gives in and the two begin an affair.\n\nCraig tells John Paul he loves him and they both agree to finish with their partners so they can be together. John Paul finishes with Spike, but Craig keeps finding excuses not to finish with Sarah. John Paul grows increasingly frustrated with Craig, who keeps on assuring him that they have a future. Spike finds out about the affair and threatens to expose it, but John Paul gets him to back down. Hannah is suffering from [[anorexia]] and tells John Paul it was triggered by their break-up, leaving him guilt-ridden.\n\nJohn Paul finally reaches his breaking point when he finds out Craig and Sarah are engaged when he walks in on their engagement party. John Paul demands that Craig makes his choice, but Craig is unable to. John Paul texts Sarah on Craig's mobile and she discovers the two of them kissing. Sarah announces to everyone at the party what she saw. Craig furiously tells John Paul he had no right to do what he did, but John Paul tells him it is all his fault.\n\nIn the aftermath of the revelation, everybody is left in pieces. John Paul still wants to be Craig and he is thrilled when Craig tells him he wants to be with him, too. Despite the disapproval of their friends and family, John Paul and Craig officially start a relationship. However, John Paul cannot get over how Craig seems ashamed to be with him. To prove his commitment to him, Craig asks John Paul to move with him to [[Dublin]]. At the airport, John Paul overhears Craig tell his brother, [[Jake Dean|Jake]] ([[Kevin Sacre]]), that he is not gay. John Paul expresses concern at Craig's reluctance to come out and this is further exacerbated by Craig not being able to bring himself to kiss John Paul in public. John Paul tells Craig he loves him with all of his heart, but that he needs more than to be with a man who cannot even display affection towards him. Heartbroken, John Paul returns home, leaving a devastated Craig to go to Dublin alone.\n\nJohn Paul tries to move on with his life. He begins attending Hollyoaks Community College and making friends with other students. Myra offers their home to a young [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[priest]] named [[List of minor Hollyoaks characters (2008)#Kieron Hobbs|Kieron Hobbs]] ([[Jake Hendriks]]). John Paul is shocked to find out that Kieron is gay, but Kieron says it does not matter since he is celibate. An attraction grows between Kieron and John Paul, but Kieron refuses to break his vow of celibacy. Eventually, he cannot deny his feeling for John Paul any longer and they begin a relationship in secret. Kieron decides to leave the church and they take their relationship public. John Paul proposes to Kieron who joyfully accepts.\n\nA while later, John Paul realises he is too young to get married and calls off the engagement, though he still wants to be with Kieron. John Paul is surprised when Craig returns to the village. Kieron accuses John Paul of not being over Craig, but John Paul insists he is. Kieron gives John Paul an ultimatum: either they get married the following week or it is over between them. John Paul tells a heartbroken Kieron that he cannot marry him. Craig tells John Paul he is not over him and wants a second chance. John Paul admits he still loves Craig and they sleep together. John Paul tells Craig he is and will always be the one. John Paul goes to finish with Kieron and is devastated when he finds Kieron dead after he was poisoned by John Paul's secret brother, [[Niall Rafferty]] ([[Barry Sloane]]). John Paul decides to start fresh with Craig and they leave together for Dublin.\n\nA few weeks later, John Paul reappears when Niall kidnaps all the McQueens. John Paul had been lured back to Hollyoaks by Niall under false pretenses. When Niall makes Myra choose four of her children to die, John Paul volunteers to sacrifice his own life. Niall blows up the church they are in. They all survive except for [[Tina McQueen|Tina]] ([[Leah Hackett]]). John Paul later returns to Dublin.\n\n===2012\u22122017===\nJohn Paul unsuccessfully attempts to prevent Craig from leaving him at the coach station in Dublin. He ends up meeting [[Brendan Brady]] ([[Emmett J. Scanlan]]) and sleeps with him. He returns home for Christmas only to find an abandoned baby at his family's doorstep. He later discover Mercedes' actions and Carmel's face accident. John Paul tells Nancy that he is the father. He reveals that he and Craig decided to have a child to save their relationship. However, it is unknown who is the paternal father. He initially rejects the baby, but decides to be a single parent and names him Matthew. He secures a teaching job at the local sixth form. His colleague [[Jen Gilmore]] (Amy Downham) gets fired when it emerges she was previously in a relationship with student [[Tilly Evans]] ([[Lucy Dixon]]). However, when Patrick discovers John Paul's awareness of Jen's actions, he believes he will lose his job, so he and Doug cover Patrick's car with post-its as a prank. It seems John Paul will embark on a relationship with [[Doug Carter]] ([[PJ Brennan]]), after a tumultuous start, the two sleep together. Later, it turns out that Patrick was not intending to fire John Paul, but suspends him from work because of his prank. John Paul later starts dating Doug but ends because Doug is still in love with [[Ste Hay]] ([[Kieron Richardson]]).\n\nJohn Paul meets supply teacher [[Danny Lomax]] ([[Stephen Billington]]). He kisses John Paul but does not see him for two weeks. John Paul later tells Danny that he will not be treated badly, but they soon begin dating. Matthew's mother, [[Chloe (Hollyoaks)|Chloe]], ([[Susan Loughnane]]) arrives and claims Craig is Matthew's father. She demands money or she will fight for custody, but a DNA test proves John Paul as the father. John Paul and Danny find the body of D.S. Trent while on a date.

He grew up around all women and was always the most level-headed of the group. John Paul meets [[Craig Dean]] ([[Guy Burnet]]) after saving him from a beating by [[Sonny Valentine]] ([[Devon Anderson]]). John Paul becomes close friends with Craig, [[Sarah Barnes]], ([[Loui Batley]]), [[Hannah Ashworth]] ([[Emma Rigby]]), and [[Nancy Hayton]] ([[Jessica Fox (actress)|Jessica Fox]]).\n\nJohn Paul and Hannah begin dating and they lose their virginity to each other. However, John Paul is clearly not as into Hannah as she is into him. After John Paul breaks up with Hannah, everyone mistakenly believes it is because he has feelings for Sarah, who is Craig's girlfriend. John Paul and Hannah later reconcile. At Hannah's 18th birthday party, John Paul emotionally confesses to Craig that he is in love with him. Afterwards, John Paul tells Craig he did not mean it and they agree to forget about it.\n\nCraig drunkenly kisses John Paul at a school dance-off competition. Hannah sees the kiss and announces it to the whole school. John Paul tells a devastated Hannah that he is gay. After Hannah's mother, [[Suzanne Ashworth|Suzanne]] ([[Suzanne Hall]]), tells Myra everything, she confronts John Paul about his sexuality. John Paul comes out to his family and while his sisters are supportive, Myra struggles with the revelation. John Paul also comes out to his friends and classmates, which leads to him being teased and bullied. Craig, not wanting to be perceived as gay, attacks John Paul physically. Craig apologises, but John Paul makes it clear they are no longer friends.\n\nJohn Paul and Craig later make up and become close again. John Paul begins dating a DJ named [[Spike (Hollyoaks)|Spike]] ([[Tom Vaughan (actor)|Tom Vaughan]]). Craig is jealous of all the time John Paul spends with Spike and John Paul tells him that he needs to accept his new relationship. Much to John Paul's surprise, Craig confesses he has feelings for him, too, and they sleep together. Afterwards, Craig pretends nothing happened between them. Eventually, they sleep together again and John Paul assumes this means Craig is going to come out. However, Craig tells John Paul that he is not gay, not finishing with Sarah, and wants to see John Paul on the side. John Paul is disgusted by the proposition at first, but he eventually gives in and the two begin an affair.\n\nCraig tells John Paul he loves him and they both agree to finish with their partners so they can be together. John Paul finishes with Spike, but Craig keeps finding excuses not to finish with Sarah. John Paul grows increasingly frustrated with Craig, who keeps on assuring him that they have a future. Spike finds out about the affair and threatens to expose it, but John Paul gets him to back down. Hannah is suffering from [[anorexia]] and tells John Paul it was triggered by their break-up, leaving him guilt-ridden.\n\nJohn Paul finally reaches his breaking point when he finds out Craig and Sarah are engaged when he walks in on their engagement party. John Paul demands that Craig makes his choice, but Craig is unable to. John Paul texts Sarah on Craig's mobile and she discovers the two of them kissing. Sarah announces to everyone at the party what she saw. Craig furiously tells John Paul he had no right to do what he did, but John Paul tells him it is all his fault.\n\nIn the aftermath of the revelation, everybody is left in pieces. John Paul still wants to be Craig and he is thrilled when Craig tells him he wants to be with him, too. Despite the disapproval of their friends and family, John Paul and Craig officially start a relationship. However, John Paul cannot get over how Craig seems ashamed to be with him. To prove his commitment to him, Craig asks John Paul to move with him to [[Dublin]]. At the airport, John Paul overhears Craig tell his brother, [[Jake Dean|Jake]] ([[Kevin Sacre]]), that he is not gay. John Paul expresses concern at Craig's reluctance to come out and this is further exacerbated by Craig not being able to bring himself to kiss John Paul in public. John Paul tells Craig he loves him with all of his heart, but that he needs more than to be with a man who cannot even display affection towards him. Heartbroken, John Paul returns home, leaving a devastated Craig to go to Dublin alone.\n\nJohn Paul tries to move on with his life. He begins attending Hollyoaks Community College and making friends with other students. Myra offers their home to a young [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[priest]] named [[List of minor Hollyoaks characters (2008)#Kieron Hobbs|Kieron Hobbs]] ([[Jake Hendriks]]). John Paul is shocked to find out that Kieron is gay, but Kieron says it does not matter since he is celibate. An attraction grows between Kieron and John Paul, but Kieron refuses to break his vow of celibacy. Eventually, he cannot deny his feeling for John Paul any longer and they begin a relationship in secret. Kieron decides to leave the church and they take their relationship public. John Paul proposes to Kieron who joyfully accepts.\n\nA while later, John Paul realises he is too young to get married and calls off the engagement, though he still wants to be with Kieron. John Paul is surprised when Craig returns to the village. Kieron accuses John Paul of not being over Craig, but John Paul insists he is. Kieron gives John Paul an ultimatum: either they get married the following week or it is over between them. John Paul tells a heartbroken Kieron that he cannot marry him. Craig tells John Paul he is not over him and wants a second chance. John Paul admits he still loves Craig and they sleep together. John Paul tells Craig he is and will always be the one.

He is characterised as smart, witty, and not afraid to stand up for himself and his beliefs. Sutton described his portrayal of John Paul's personality as different and similar to his own. \"He's very, very quick to take [offence] sometimes\", Sutton relayed. \"He's a bit up and down, so that's a side of him I\u2019m not too keen on, but he's also very sensitive and loving and he cares a lot about his family and his friends and that side of it is very true to me as well and that's kind of what I kind of brought to the table.\"<ref name=\"www.afterelton.com\">{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Jensen |title=Interview with James Sutton |publisher=[[AfterElton.com]] |date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=2008-08-17 |url=http://www.afterelton.com/people/2008/7/james_sutton |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816150451/http://www.afterelton.com/people/2008/7/james_sutton |archivedate=2008-08-16 |df= }}</ref> Sutton stated that he had no trouble portraying a [[gay]] character because he had \"spent a good part of [his] youth [in the theater] and there were a lot of openly gay men\".<ref name=www.afterelton.com/>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nWhen detailing insight he gained about the [[gay community]] while portraying John Paul, Sutton stated, \"My character was [[Heterosexuality|straight]] when I first started so I had to do the whole sort of [[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning your sexuality]] and finding out who you are and what you\u2019re about and what your likes are and what your sexual preferences are, so I got a real insight from the storyline and just how hard it is.\"<ref name=www.afterelton.com/> Sutton cited that John Paul \"was very, very lucky in that his family were pretty much all supportive\". Further detailing his character's personality and how he did not want John Paul to be a [[LGBT stereotypes|gay stereotype]], Sutton revealed, \"I was very, very keen to make this character a straight-acting gay man. He's just a normal guy, like any other guy. He plays football. He likes music. He likes going out. He likes all the same things that straight men like.
