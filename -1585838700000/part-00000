''Roe v. Wade'' reshaped U.S. politics, dividing much of the United States into [[anti-choice]] and [[pro-choice]], while activating [[grassroots]] movements on both sides.\n\nThe decision involved the case of a woman named [[Norma McCorvey]]{{mdash}}known in her lawsuit under the pseudonym \"Jane Roe\"{{mdash}}who in 1969 became pregnant with her third child and wanted an abortion. However, McCorvey lived in Texas, where abortion was illegal except when necessary to save the mother's life. She was referred to lawyers [[Sarah Weddington]] and [[Linda Coffee]], who filed a lawsuit on her behalf in U.S. federal court against her local [[district attorney]], [[Henry Wade]], alleging that Texas's abortion laws were unconstitutional. A three-judge panel of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas]] heard the case and ruled in her favor. Texas then appealed this ruling directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.\n\nIn January 1973, the Supreme Court issued a 7\u20132 decision holding that the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] provides a \"right to privacy\" that protects a pregnant woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion.

''Roe v. Wade'' reshaped U.S. politics, dividing much of the United States into [[anti-abortion]] and [[pro-choice|pro-abortion rights]] camps, while activating [[grassroots]] movements on both sides.\n\nThe decision involved the case of a woman named [[Norma McCorvey]]{{mdash}}known in her lawsuit under the pseudonym \"Jane Roe\"{{mdash}}who in 1969 became pregnant with her third child and wanted an abortion. However, McCorvey lived in Texas, where abortion was illegal except when necessary to save the mother's life. She was referred to lawyers [[Sarah Weddington]] and [[Linda Coffee]], who filed a lawsuit on her behalf in U.S. federal court against her local [[district attorney]], [[Henry Wade]], alleging that Texas's abortion laws were unconstitutional. A three-judge panel of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas|U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas]] heard the case and ruled in her favor. Texas then appealed this ruling directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.\n\nIn January 1973, the Supreme Court issued a 7\u20132 decision holding that the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]] provides a \"right to privacy\" that protects a pregnant woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. However, it held that this right is not absolute, and must be balanced against the government's interests in protecting women's health and protecting prenatal life.{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;18.29(a)(i)}}{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}} The Court resolved this [[balancing test]] by tying state regulation of abortion to the three [[Trimester (pregnancy)#Physiology|trimesters of pregnancy]]: during the first trimester, governments could not prohibit abortions at all; during the second trimester, governments could require reasonable health regulations; during the third trimester, abortions could be prohibited entirely so long as the laws contained exceptions for cases when they were necessary to save the life or health of the mother.{{sfnp|Chemerinsky|2019|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;10.3.3.1, p. 887}} The Court classified the right to choose to have an abortion as \"fundamental\", which required courts to evaluate challenged abortion laws under the \"[[strict scrutiny]]\" standard, the highest level of judicial review in the United States.{{sfnp|Nowak|Rotunda|2012|loc=\u00a7&nbsp;18.29(b)(i)}}\n\n''Roe'' was criticized by some in the legal community,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Limits: The Role of the Law in Bioethical Decision Making|last=Dworkin|first=Roger|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|year=1996|isbn=978-0253330758|location=|pages=28\u201336}}</ref> and some have called the decision a form of [[judicial activism]].<ref name=\":1\" /> In a prominent ''[[Yale Law Journal]]'' article published soon after the decision was issued,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{harvnb|Greenhouse|2005|pp=135\u201336}}</ref> the legal scholar [[John Hart Ely]] criticized ''Roe'' as a decision that \"is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be.\"<ref>Ely, John Hart. \"[http://www.timothypcarney.com/wages-wolf.htm The Wages of Crying Wolf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625170521/http://www.timothypcarney.com/wages-wolf.htm|date=2007-06-25}}\", 82 ''Yale Law Journal'' 920 (1973).

He later became an Austrian, and then a British, citizen. He was a noted expert on the drawings of [[Michelangelo]]. Wilde was a pioneer of the use of [[X-rays]] as a tool for the study of both the creation and the state of conservation of paintings. From 1948 to 1958 he was deputy director of the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] in London.<ref name=court/><ref name=dnb/>\n\n==Life==\nJohannes Wilde was born J\u00e1nos Wilde on 2 July 1891 in [[Budapest]], Hungary. He was the last of six children of Richard Wilde (died 1912) and his wife Rosa ''n\u00e9e'' Somj\u00e1gy (died 1928). From 1909 to 1914 he studied art, philosophy and archeology at the [[University of Budapest]] and then from 1915 to 1917 studied for a doctorate under [[Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] at the [[University of Vienna]], defending his thesis ''summa cum laude'' in July 1918. He returned to Budapest and was until 1922 an assistant to [[Simon Meller]] in the department of prints and drawings of the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]].\n\nIn the brief period of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] of [[B\u00e9la Kun]] in 1919, Wilde worked with [[Frederick Antal]] on the sequestration of privately owned works of art of national significance.\n\nMax Dvo\u0159\u00e1k died in February 1921, and in 1922 Wilde moved permanently to Vienna in order to work with [[Carl Maria Swoboda]] on a collected edition of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's writings. This was published between 1924 and 1929. He became an Austrian citizen in 1928, and on 6 February 1930 married the art historian Julia Gy\u00e1rf\u00e1s.<ref name=dnb/>\n\n==Theatrum Pictorium==\nFrom 1923 Wilde worked as an assistant Keeper, and later as a Keeper, at the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] of Vienna, where he worked principally on [[Italian Renaissance]] paintings. Many of the paintings in the collections of the museum were in a poor state of conservation in the [[Hofburg]].<ref name=hirst/> He carefully researched and catalogued the Italian paintings, many of which were documented in [[David Teniers the Younger]]'s [[Theatrum Pictorium]], though with incorrect attributions. \n\nIt was Wilde who discovered that the hitherto separate paintings by [[Antonello da Messina]] in the collection \"[[:File:Antonello da Messina - Pala di San Cassiano Detail- San Nicholas - Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna.jpg|St. Nicolas and a Female Saint]]\" (attributed by Teniers to Bellini), \"[[:File:Antonello da Messina 063.jpg|The Virgin and Child Enthroned]]\", and \"[[:File:Antonello da Messina 008.jpg|St. Dominic and St. Ursula]]\", were all fragments of one altarpiece and he oversaw the reconconstruction of the [[San Cassiano Altarpiece]] in 1928.<ref>J.

Samml. in Wien, n. s., III (1929), pp. 57-72</ref>\n\n==X-rays==\nBy about 1928 Wilde and the restorer Sebastian Isepp were using [[X-radiation]] as a systematic aid to understanding both the physical condition of paintings and the artistic processes by which those paintings had been created. At first they made use of the facilities of the R\u00f6ntgenologisches Institut of [[Vienna University]], but in 1930 an X-ray laboratory was installed at the Kunsthistorisches Museum. While Wilde was not the first to use X-rays to examine pictures, this was the first such laboratory in Europe. He first published his findings on [[The Gypsy Madonna]] and [[The Three Philosophers]]'<ref name=hirst/> In the next eight years Wilde made more than 1000 X-ray photographs of works in the museum. He also maintained a steady flow of scholarly publications.<ref name=hirst/>\n\n==Britain==\nAfter the [[Anschluss]], the annexation of Austria into the German [[Third Reich]] on 12 March 1938, Wilde's Hungarian Jewish wife Julia was at risk. With the help of friends including Count [[Antoine Seilern]], the couple left Vienna for the Netherlands in April 1939 to visit an art exhibition; from there they flew to England, where they stayed at the home of [[Sir Kenneth Clark]], director of the [[National Gallery]] and [[Surveyor of the King's Pictures]]. \n\nWilde soon went to [[Aberystwyth]] to work on Seilern's pictures, which had been sent to the [[National Library of Wales]] for safety at the beginning of the [[Second World War]]. He also worked on the pictures of the National Gallery, which were in the same building. The [[British Museum]] collection of Italian drawings was also housed there and, through [[Arthur Ewart Popham]], Wilde was asked in June 1940 by the Trustees of the museum to start work on cataloguing them too.<ref name=\"dnb\" />\n\nIn the same year, in what Kenneth Clark describes as a \"revolting incident\", Wilde was charged with signalling to enemy submarines, interned in a concentration camp, and deported to another camp in Canada, where he barely survived.<ref name=dnb/><ref name=clark/>\n\n==Publications==\nThe publications of Johannes Wilde include:\n*Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k; Carl Maria Swoboda and Johannes Wilde (eds.), ''Kunstgeschichte als Geistesgeschichte.

All games must have features exclusive to the console, and must be rated E or E10+ by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]], or PEGI 3 or PEGI 7 by [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]].
