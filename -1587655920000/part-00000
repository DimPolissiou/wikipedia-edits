It is in [[Simcoe County]] between [[Lake Couchiching]] and [[Lake Simcoe]]. Although it is in Simcoe County, the city is [[Independent city|politically independent]].  It is part of the [[Huronia (region)|Huronia]] region of [[Central Ontario]]. The population in 2016 was 31,166.<ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n\nIt was incorporated as a village in 1867, but the history of what is today the City of Orillia dates back at least several thousand years. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence of fishing by the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Iroquois]] peoples in the area over 4,000 years ago, and of sites used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Aboriginal peoples]] for hundreds of years for trading, hunting, and fishing.\n\nKnown as the \"Sunshine City\", the city's large waterfront attracts many tourists to the area every year, as do a number of annual festivals and other cultural attractions. While the area's largest employer is [[Casino Rama]], overall economic activity in Orillia is a mixture of many different industries including manufacturing, government services, customer service and tourism.\n\nOrillia is located on the shores of two connected lakes: [[Lake Simcoe]] and [[Lake Couchiching]]. Both lakes are part of the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]]. Travel north on Lake Couchiching, then through three [[Canal lock|locks]] and the only marine railway ([[Big Chute Marine Railway]]) still in use in [[North America]] leads to [[Georgian Bay]] on [[Lake Huron]]. Travel south-east across Lake Simcoe, through many [[Canal lock|locks]] (including two of the highest hydraulic lift locks in the world, [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] and [[Kirkfield Lift Lock]]) eventually leads to [[Lake Ontario]]. From either of these [[Great Lakes]] one can connect to the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]] and thence to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:PortionofSamueldeChamplainMonumentinOrilliaOntario.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bronze monument featuring a Christian missionary holding a cross high over the heads of two North American aboriginal peoples sitting at his feet|The Christian missionary portion of the [[Samuel de Champlain]] monument designed by [[Vernon March]] in Orillia]]\n[[File:Orillia City Hall.jpg|thumb|Orillia City Hall]]\nThe human history of the area extends back several thousand years: in the \"Narrows\", a small waterway that connects [[Lake Couchiching]] and [[Lake Simcoe]], there is marine [[archaeological]] evidence of ancient [[fishing weir]]s used by [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Iroquois]] people to trap fish over 4,000 years ago. Also, there are several archaeological sites in the surrounding area that provide evidence of trading, fishing, and hunting camps that were visited for hundreds of years by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]].\n\nAlso of historical note, the famed French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] visited the area that would later become Orillia in the summer of 1615, travelling over what would become the Coldwater Road centuries later; it was used by the Hurons, Ojibways, French and British as a fur-trading route. Champlain spent the winter with the Hurons in their chief village of Cahiague (near the current Warminster).<ref name=\"Champlain\"/>  Ecole Samuel de Champlain, a local francophone elementary school, is named in his honour. A monument to Samuel de Champlain can also be found in Couchiching Beach Park and is a [[National Historic Site of Canada]].\n\nThe government made treaties with the Hurons in 1798, 1815 and 1818 to gain land to the north and west of Lake Simcoe and then made grants to military veterans.<ref name=\"Champlain\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Simcoe58.html |title=Champlain in Ontario, 1615\n|website=OntarioPlaques.com |publisher=Alan L.

The settlement had a church, a post office, four stores, three taverns, a tannery, two blacksmiths, four shoemakers, a tailor, and two furniture makers.

The book was based on Leacock's experiences in the town and since the book's release, the city has attempted to mimic the fictional location in as many ways as possible. The Leacock Museum and National Historic Site, located in Orillia, is one of the [[National Historic Sites of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historicplacesday.ca/places/leacock-museum-national-historic-site/ |title=Leacock Museum National Historic Site | accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[William E. Bell (author)|William E. Bell's]] 1989 novel ''Five Days of the Ghost'' was also set in Orillia, with many readers recognizing popular local spots, including the Guardian Angels Catholic Church, the [[Samuel de Champlain]] statue in [[Couchiching Beach Park]] as well as [[Big Chief Island]] in the middle of [[Lake Couchiching]].\n\nOrillia was the first municipality in North America to introduce [[daylight saving time]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2017/07/08/bold-attempt-at-daylight-saving-time-became-a-comic-failure-in-orillia.html |title=Bold attempt at daylight saving time became a comic failure in Orillia|publisher=Toronto Star | date=8 July 2017 | accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref> and had the first municipal hydroelectric transmission plant<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM52FB_FIRST_HYDRO_ELECTRIC_PLANT__Orillia_Ontario_CANADA |title=FIRST HYDRO-ELECTRIC PLANT - Orillia, Ontario CANADA | accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref> in North America.\n\n===Etymology===\nThe first recorded use of the name to describe the region, which until then had no officially sanctioned designation, was in 1820 when the name was given in [[Toronto|York]], [[Upper Canada]] by then [[Lieutenant-Governors of Ontario|Lieutenant-Governor]] Sir [[Peregrine Maitland]]. Maitland was a veteran of the [[United Kingdom|British]] campaign against the [[First French Empire|French]] in [[Spain]], called the [[Peninsular War]], during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] where he served under the command of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]].\n\nWhile there are no records clearly indicating the reason for the name Orillia, the most common explanation holds that the name originates in the [[Spanish language|Spanish]], \"orilla,\" which can mean the shore of either a lake or river. The Spanish pronunciation sounds much like, \"oreeya,\" and since the word itself is spelled almost identically to Orillia, without the second, \"i,\" it has come to be commonly accepted as the source word for the city's name. Further backing the theory of a Spanish origin are the names of surrounding communities and landmarks, which include [[Oro-Medonte|Oro]] for [[gold]], [[Mariposa, Ontario|Mariposa]] for [[butterfly]], and [[Mono, Ontario|Mono]] for [[monkey]]. Historical documents contain a second spelling of the name which was never officially recognised, Aurelia, which when pronounced sounds similar to the name and is considered a [[clerical error]].<ref>Why Call it That? by Ross McDonald, published by the Orillia Historical Society.

Subsequently, Orillia's economics has ranged from farming (even downtown) to machinery, to automobiles and even one of the first \"campers\" (a pop-up tent in a car).\n\nEconomic activity in Orillia is a mix of manufacturing, government services, customer service and tourism. The largest employer in the area is [[Casino Rama]], located in the nearby [[Indian reserve|reserve]] land of the [[Chippewas of Rama First Nation]]. Manufacturing operations in the city include CCI Thermal Technologies (industrial heaters and heating components), Dorr-Oliver Eimco (industrial equipment), Kubota Metal Corporation ([[petrochemical industry]] components), [[Parker Hannifin]] (moulded rubber products), Pliant Corporation (components for the packaging industry), Smiths Aerospace Components (aerospace industry machining) and TI Group Automotive Systems (automotive components). Call centre Tele Tech Canada also employs approximately 850 people. The Central Operations Headquarters for Ontario Provincial Police is located in Orillia (Memorial Drive), as is the regional headquarters.\n\nHeywood-Wakefield seating, which operated from the early 20th century, announced it was closing its doors in September 2007.

Rope & Twine, which was one of the foremost North American producers of braided rope from 1973 to 1985, was also the inventor of the automotive grocery or cargo restraint net. The net was introduced with the launch of the Ford Taurus at Christmas 1985, and shortly thereafter the company was sold and became Polytech Netting Industries, which employed several hundred people until moving to Mexico in 1996\u201397. G.W.B. Rope and Twine's founders, Gordon W. Brown and family, launched G&B Ropes in 1990. (Their son Sean Brown worked with G&B Ropes until it transferred ownership around 1998. Sean Brown then assisted in the development of Orillia's newest rope-making business, Redpoint Ropes.)\n\nLarge public-sector employers include the headquarters for the [[Ontario Provincial Police]], which is located in Orillia. The [[Huronia Regional Centre]], formerly an asylum that later became an institution to house disabled people, was one of the area's largest employers for many decades until the de-institutionalization movement of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n==Recreation and culture==\nOrillia is known as the \"Sunshine City\", taking the moniker from its role as the fictional \"Mariposa\" in the book ''[[Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town]]'' by [[Stephen Leacock]]. Many local businesses also use \"Mariposa\" in their names.\n\nThe city council has actively restricted the construction of large buildings downtown and seeks to maintain a certain \"small town\" look with regard to signs and decorations. However, in 2017 plans were further discussed to redevelop the waterfront district and other areas underdeveloped or otherwise vacant. A 3D model was developed at the local Royal Canadian Legion to reflect the possible future and is to be on display in city hall.\n[[Image:Stephen Leacock House Orillia.jpg|thumb|left|Leacock Museum and National Historic Site]]\n\nOrillia's \"Arts District\" is located on Peter St. S., between Mississauga St. E. and Colborne St. E. and is home to a variety of art galleries, fine dining and shops. At its centre is the Orillia Museum of Art & History, considered the hub of art and culture for the city, playing an instrumental role in municipal cultural events.\n\nThe museum occupies all four floors of the historic Sir Sam Steele Building, a landmark destination for both residents and visitors. A collection of over 10,000 artefacts of regional historical significance features in a rotating exhibits schedule. On a separate floor is contemporary art space with exhibits featuring regional and international artists. The museum also features a designated education space and hosts activities including art-making and interpretive programming for children, artists, artisans, historians, etc.\n\nMany tourists and boaters are attracted to the city each year because of its waterfront park Couchiching Beach Park/Centennial Park/Port of Orillia and its position as a gateway to Lake Country, cottage country in [[Muskoka]], [[Algonquin Provincial Park]], the [[Trent\u2013Severn Waterway]] and other natural attractions. The city's waterfront has an extensive lakeshore boardwalk, a large park with two beaches, several playgrounds, an outdoor theatre, a touring ferry, and a children's train.\n\nThe city of Orillia also is home to a large number of retirement homes (currently nine, with four more under construction). As such, it is often characterized as a \"retirement community\", although less than 18% of the city's population is actually over 65 (see below).\n\nOrillia is home to an annual Perch Fishing Festival. Perch are netted, tagged, and released into the local lake, to be caught for prize money. This event also includes a large social gathering consisting of a \"perch fry\". Other popular annual festivals include the Leacock Festival, Blues Festival, Jazz Festival, Scottish Festival, and Beatles Festival.\n\nThe Port of Orillia holds an annual \"Christmas in June\", which includes a boat decorating contest and turkey buffet. Boat and cottage shows are held in June and August.\n\nOrillia also hosts an annual Canada Day event at Couchiching Beach Park.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://orilliacanadaday.ca/|title=Orillia Canada Day|access-date= 10 August 2019}}</ref> The day begins with a traditional pancake breakfast served by the Mayor and Council, and ends with a large fireworks display at dusk.\n\nOrillia is the original and current site of the popular [[Mariposa Folk Festival]]. Beginning in 1961, this festival is the longest running folk festival in Canada.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mariposafolk.com/the-foundation/history/|title=History - Mariposa Folk Foundation|work=Mariposa Folk Foundation|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe Stephen Leacock Associates have honoured former Orillia resident and humourist [[Stephen Leacock]]'s memory since 1947 with the annual [[Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour]], awarded to the best Canadian humorous book published the previous year.  The Leacock Medal Gala and Award ceremony is held each June at nearby Geneva Park, with tickets for sale to the public.\n\nThe [[Royal Canadian Legion]] sponsors a yearly Scottish Festival at Couchiching Beach Park and Centennial Park in July each year.

It is in [[Simcoe County]] between [[Lake Couchiching]] and [[Lake Simcoe]]. Although it is in Simcoe County, the city is [[Independent city|politically independent]].  It is part of the [[Huronia (region)|Huronia]] region of [[Central Ontario]]. The population in 2016 was 31,166.<ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n\nIt was incorporated as a village in 1867, but the history of what is today the City of Orillia dates back at least several thousand years. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence of fishing by the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Iroquois]] peoples in the area over 4,000 years ago, and of sites used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Aboriginal peoples]] for hundreds of years for trading, hunting, and fishing.\n\nKnown as the \"Sunshine City\", the city's large waterfront attracts many tourists to the area every year, as do a number of annual festivals and other cultural attractions. While the area's largest employer is [[Casino Rama]], overall economic activity in Orillia is a mixture of many different industries including manufacturing, government services, customer service and tourism.\n\nOrillia is located on the shores of two connected lakes: [[Lake Simcoe]] and [[Lake Couchiching]]. Both lakes are part of the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]]. Travel north on Lake Couchiching, then through three [[Canal lock|locks]] and the only marine railway ([[Big Chute Marine Railway]]) still in use in [[North America]] leads to [[Georgian Bay]] on [[Lake Huron]]. Travel south-east across Lake Simcoe, through many [[Canal lock|locks]] (including two of the highest hydraulic lift locks in the world, [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] and [[Kirkfield Lift Lock]]) eventually leads to [[Lake Ontario]]. From either of these [[Great Lakes]] one can connect to the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]] and thence to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:PortionofSamueldeChamplainMonumentinOrilliaOntario.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A bronze monument featuring a Christian missionary holding a cross high over the heads of two North American aboriginal peoples sitting at his feet|The Christian missionary portion of the [[Samuel de Champlain]] monument designed by [[Vernon March]] in Orillia]]\n[[File:Orillia City Hall.jpg|thumb|Orillia City Hall]]\nThe human history of the area extends back several thousand years: in the \"Narrows\", a small waterway that connects [[Lake Couchiching]] and [[Lake Simcoe]], there is marine [[archaeological]] evidence of ancient [[fishing weir]]s used by [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Iroquois]] people to trap fish over 4,000 years ago. Also, there are several archaeological sites in the surrounding area that provide evidence of trading, fishing, and hunting camps that were visited for hundreds of years by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]].\n\nAlso of historical note, the famed French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] visited the area that would later become Orillia in the summer of 1615, travelling over what would become the Coldwater Road centuries later; it was used by the Hurons, Ojibways, French and British as a fur-trading route. Champlain spent the winter with the Hurons in their chief village of Cahiague (near the current Warminster).<ref name=\"Champlain\"/>  Ecole Samuel de Champlain, a local francophone elementary school, is named in his honour. A monument to Samuel de Champlain can also be found in Couchiching Beach Park and is a [[National Historic Site of Canada]].\n\nThe government made treaties with the Hurons in 1798, 1815 and 1818 to gain land to the north and west of Lake Simcoe and then made grants to military veterans.<ref name=\"Champlain\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Simcoe58.html |title=Champlain in Ontario, 1615\n|website=OntarioPlaques.com |publisher=Alan L.

The settlement had a church, a post office, four stores, three taverns, a tannery, two blacksmiths, four shoemakers, a tailor, and two furniture makers. A grist mill could be found about a mile away.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

The book was based on Leacock's experiences in the town and since the book's release, the city has attempted to mimic the fictional location in as many ways as possible. The Leacock Museum and National Historic Site, located in Orillia, is one of the [[National Historic Sites of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historicplacesday.ca/places/leacock-museum-national-historic-site/ |title=Leacock Museum National Historic Site | accessdate=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[William E.

Maitland was a veteran of the [[United Kingdom|British]] campaign against the [[First French Empire|French]] in [[Spain]], called the [[Peninsular War]], during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] where he served under the command of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]].\n\nWhile there are no records clearly indicating the reason for the name Orillia, the most common explanation holds that the name originates in the [[Spanish language|Spanish]], \"orilla,\" which can mean the shore of either a lake or river. The Spanish pronunciation sounds much like, \"oreeya,\" and since the word itself is spelled almost identically to Orillia, without the second, \"i,\" it has come to be commonly accepted as the source word for the city's name. Further backing the theory of a Spanish origin are the names of surrounding communities and landmarks, which include [[Oro-Medonte|Oro]] for [[gold]], [[Mariposa, Ontario|Mariposa]] for [[butterfly]], and [[Mono, Ontario|Mono]] for [[monkey]]. Historical documents contain a second spelling of the name which was never officially recognised, Aurelia, which when pronounced sounds similar to the name and is considered a [[clerical error]].<ref>Why Call it That? by Ross McDonald, published by the Orillia Historical Society.

The city has experienced growth for the past fifteen years, with a population increase of over 2,000 residents (7.0 percent) since the 2001 census. The median household income in 2015 for Orillia was $55,802, which is below the Ontario provincial average of $74,287.<ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n\n==Government==\nOrillia is governed by the [[Orillia City Council]], which consists of eight city councillors and a mayor.\n\nThere are four wards in the city.\n\nFrom 1875 to 1969 the council was led by a reeve or mayor. Since 1969 the head of the council is the mayor.\n\n==Grape Island==\n\n'''Grape Island''' is a lake island located off Victoria Point in the north end of [[Lake Simcoe]].\n\nToday the island is occupied by about 40 private homes or cottages and residences are part of the ''Grape Island Property Owners Association'' (c. 1952).<ref name=\"GrapeIs\">{{cite news |url=https://www.orilliamatters.com/local-news/councils-grape-island-decision-not-fair-to-anyone-820211 |title=Council's Grape Island decision 'not fair to anyone' |date=January 23, 2018|first=Dave |last=Dawson |website=OrilliaMatters.com |accessdate=July 7, 2019}}</ref> Access is restricted to residents of the island with access by boat from Forest Avenue South dock to private docks on the island.<ref name=\"GrapeIs\"/> The heavy traffic at the mainland docks have resulted in tensions between island residents and residents of Victoria Point.<ref name=\"GrapeIs\"/> The city of Orillia is working on finding a solution for access to the island without inconveniencing residents in Victoria Point.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bayshorebroadcasting.ca/news_item.php?NewsID=104117 |title=Search for New Location for Grape Island Dock |date=September 11, 2018 |first=Ken |last=Hashizume |publisher=Bayshore Broadcasting |accessdate=July 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are no vehicular roads on the island.

Subsequently, Orillia's economics has ranged from farming (even downtown) to machinery, to automobiles and even one of the first \"campers\" (a pop-up tent in a car).\n\nEconomic activity in Orillia is a mix of manufacturing, government services, customer service and tourism. The largest employer in the area is [[Casino Rama]], located in the nearby [[Indian reserve|reserve]] land of the [[Chippewas of Rama First Nation]]. Manufacturing operations in the city include CCI Thermal Technologies (industrial heaters and heating components), Dorr-Oliver Eimco (industrial equipment), Kubota Metal Corporation ([[petrochemical industry]] components), [[Parker Hannifin]] (moulded rubber products), Pliant Corporation (components for the packaging industry), Smiths Aerospace Components (aerospace industry machining) and TI Group Automotive Systems (automotive components). Call centre Tele Tech Canada also employs approximately 850 people. The Central Operations Headquarters for Ontario Provincial Police is located in Orillia (Memorial Drive), as is the regional headquarters.\n\nHeywood-Wakefield seating, which operated from the early 20th century, announced it was closing its doors in September 2007. In late July 2009, Parker Hannifin announced that they were shutting down their operations in Orillia at the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.midlandmirror.com/midlandmirror/article/142346|title=Simcoe County Breaking News - Simcoe County's Online Newspaper - Simcoe.com|website=Simcoe.com|accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nG.W.B. Rope & Twine, which was one of the foremost North American producers of braided rope from 1973 to 1985, was also the inventor of the automotive grocery or cargo restraint net. The net was introduced with the launch of the Ford Taurus at Christmas 1985, and shortly thereafter the company was sold and became Polytech Netting Industries, which employed several hundred people until moving to Mexico in 1996\u201397. G.W.B. Rope and Twine's founders, Gordon W. Brown and family, launched G&B Ropes in 1990. (Their son Sean Brown worked with G&B Ropes until it transferred ownership around 1998. Sean Brown then assisted in the development of Orillia's newest rope-making business, Redpoint Ropes.)\n\nLarge public-sector employers include the headquarters for the [[Ontario Provincial Police]], which is located in Orillia. The [[Huronia Regional Centre]], formerly an asylum that later became an institution to house disabled people, was one of the area's largest employers for many decades until the de-institutionalization movement of the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n==Recreation and culture==\nOrillia is known as the \"Sunshine City\", taking the moniker from its role as the fictional \"Mariposa\" in the book ''[[Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town]]'' by [[Stephen Leacock]]. Many local businesses also use \"Mariposa\" in their names.\n\nThe city council has actively restricted the construction of large buildings downtown and seeks to maintain a certain \"small town\" look with regard to signs and decorations. However, in 2017 plans were further discussed to redevelop the waterfront district and other areas underdeveloped or otherwise vacant. A 3D model was developed at the local Royal Canadian Legion to reflect the possible future and is to be on display in city hall.\n[[Image:Stephen Leacock House Orillia.jpg|thumb|left|Leacock Museum and National Historic Site]]\n\nOrillia's \"Arts District\" is located on Peter St. S., between Mississauga St. E. and Colborne St. E. and is home to a variety of art galleries, fine dining and shops. At its centre is the Orillia Museum of Art & History, considered the hub of art and culture for the city, playing an instrumental role in municipal cultural events.\n\nThe museum occupies all four floors of the historic Sir Sam Steele Building, a landmark destination for both residents and visitors. A collection of over 10,000 artefacts of regional historical significance features in a rotating exhibits schedule. On a separate floor is contemporary art space with exhibits featuring regional and international artists. The museum also features a designated education space and hosts activities including art-making and interpretive programming for children, artists, artisans, historians, etc.\n\nMany tourists and boaters are attracted to the city each year because of its waterfront park Couchiching Beach Park/Centennial Park/Port of Orillia and its position as a gateway to Lake Country, cottage country in [[Muskoka]], [[Algonquin Provincial Park]], the [[Trent\u2013Severn Waterway]] and other natural attractions. The city's waterfront has an extensive lakeshore boardwalk, a large park with two beaches, several playgrounds, an outdoor theatre, a touring ferry, and a children's train.\n\nThe city of Orillia also is home to a large number of retirement homes (currently nine, with four more under construction). As such, it is often characterized as a \"retirement community\", although less than 18% of the city's population is actually over 65 (see below).\n\nOrillia is home to an annual Perch Fishing Festival. Perch are netted, tagged, and released into the local lake, to be caught for prize money. This event also includes a large social gathering consisting of a \"perch fry\". Other popular annual festivals include the Leacock Festival, Blues Festival, Jazz Festival, Scottish Festival, and Beatles Festival.\n\nThe Port of Orillia holds an annual \"Christmas in June\", which includes a boat decorating contest and turkey buffet. Boat and cottage shows are held in June and August.\n\nOrillia also hosts an annual Canada Day event at Couchiching Beach Park.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://orilliacanadaday.ca/|title=Orillia Canada Day|access-date= 10 August 2019}}</ref> The day begins with a traditional pancake breakfast served by the Mayor and Council, and ends with a large fireworks display at dusk.\n\nOrillia is the original and current site of the popular [[Mariposa Folk Festival]]. Beginning in 1961, this festival is the longest running folk festival in Canada.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mariposafolk.com/the-foundation/history/|title=History - Mariposa Folk Foundation|work=Mariposa Folk Foundation|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe Stephen Leacock Associates have honoured former Orillia resident and humourist [[Stephen Leacock]]'s memory since 1947 with the annual [[Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour]], awarded to the best Canadian humorous book published the previous year.  The Leacock Medal Gala and Award ceremony is held each June at nearby Geneva Park, with tickets for sale to the public.\n\nThe [[Royal Canadian Legion]] sponsors a yearly Scottish Festival at Couchiching Beach Park and Centennial Park in July each year. Marching bands from around the country participate.\n\nSince 1963, the [[Webers]] hamburger restaurant has been approximately 1&nbsp;km north of Orillia,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Webers+Restaurant/@44.6940158,-79.3988699,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4d2aa6784cfe299f:0x759e8003df69dd60|title=Webers Location Google Maps|publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=19 August 2015}}</ref> next to [[Ontario Highway 11]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.readersdigest.ca/food/bbq/canadas-8-greatest-burger-restaurants?id=2|title=Canada's 8 Greatest Burger Restaurants|last=Sue Campbell & Jen McMorran|work=[[Reader's Digest]]|accessdate=19 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/living/article/1236157--the-dish-on-cottage-country-s-famous-foodie-treats-burgers-to-butter-tarts|title=The dish on cottage country\u2019s famous foodie treats: burgers to butter tarts|last=Ogilvie|first=Megan|date=3 August 2012|work=[[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=19 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nLake St. George Golf Club is ten minutes north of Orillia.\n\n==Education==\nBoth French and English public education is offered in Orillia.\n\nThere is one Catholic French-language elementary school, ''\u00c9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire catholique Samuel-de-Champlain'', operated by the [[Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud]].<ref>[http://www.sdc.csdccs.edu.on.ca \u00c9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire catholique Samuel-de-Champlain]</ref>\n\nStudents from this elementary school attend ''\u00c9cole secondaire catholique Nouvelle-Alliance'', which is operated by the same board and is located in Barrie.<ref>[http://www.escna.csdccs.edu.on.ca \u00c9cole secondaire catholique Nouvelle-Alliance]</ref>\n\nEnglish public education in Orillia is provided via the [[Simcoe County District School Board]], which has nine elementary and three secondary schools in the city.

For example, the following data satisfy the parallel condition. In parallel data, even if a correlation matrix is used instead of a covariance matrix, there is no loss of information.

Conventional names give no information about the nature of each coefficient, or give misleading information (e.g., composite reliability). Conventional names are inconsistent. Some are formulas, and others are coefficients. Some are named after the original developer, some are named after someone who is not the original developer, and others do not include the name of any person. While one formula is referred to by multiple names, multiple formulas are referred to by one notation (e.g., alphas and omegas).

However, this interpretation overlooks the fact that <math>\\rho_{ST}</math> underestimes reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. At the population level, the maximum of all possible <math>\\rho_{ST}</math> values is closer to reliability than the average of all possible <math>\\rho_{ST}</math> values.<ref name=ChoKim/> This mathematical fact was already known even before the publication of Cronbach (1951).<ref name=Guttman>Guttman, L.

They did not give the reliability coefficients particular names. Equation 20 in their article is <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. This formula is often referred to as Kuder-Richardson Formula 20, or KR-20.

A review of this paper reveals that they did not present a general formula because they did not need to, not because they were not able to. Let <math>p_i</math> denote the correct answer ratio of item <math>i </math>, and <math>q_i</math> denote the incorrect answer ratio of item <math>i</math> (<math>p_i + q_i = 1 </math>). The formula of KR-20 is as follows.\n</br><math>{\\rho}_{KR-20} = {{k} \\over {k-1} } \\left(1 - {{\\sum_{i=1}^k p_i q_i}\\over {\\sigma^2_X}} \\right)</math>\n\nSince <math>p_i q_i = \\sigma^2 _i</math>, KR-20 and <math>\\rho_{T}</math> have the same meaning.\n\n===Between 1937 and 1951===\n==== Several studies published the general formula of KR-20 ====\nKuder and Richardson (1937) made unnecessary assumptions to derive <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. Several studies have derived <math> \\rho_{T}</math> in a different way from Kuder and Richardson (1937). \n\nHoyt (1941)<ref name = Hoyt> Hoyt, C. (1941).

[[Cyril Hoyt]] may be considered the first developer of the general formula of the KR-20, but he did not explicitly present the formula of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>.\n\nThe first expression of the modern formula of <math> \\rho_{T} </math> appears in Jackson and Ferguson (1941)<ref name =JF>Jackson, R.

[[Louis Guttman]] proved that all of these formulas were always less than or equal to reliability, and based on these characteristics, he referred to these formulas as 'lower bounds of reliability'. Guttman's <math> \\lambda_4 </math> is <math> \\rho_{ST} </math>, and <math> \\lambda_3 </math> is <math> \\rho_{T} </math>. He proved that <math> \\lambda_2 </math> is always greater than or equal to <math> \\lambda_3 </math> (i.e., more accurate). At that time, all calculations were done with paper and pencil, and since the formula of <math> \\lambda_3 </math> was simpler to calculate, he mentioned that <math> \\lambda_3 </math> was useful under certain conditions. \n</br><math>\\lambda_3 = {\\rho}_{T} = {{k} \\over {k-1} } \\left(1 - {{\\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma^2_i}\\over {\\sigma^2_X}} \\right)</math>\n\nGulliksen (1950)<ref name = Gulliksen>Gulliksen, H.

The assumption he used is essential tau-equivalence in modern terms.\n\n====Recognition of  KR-20's original formula and general formula at the time====\nThe two formulas were recognized to be exactly identical, and the expression of general formula of KR-20 was not used. Hoyt<ref name = Hoyt/> explained that his method \"gives precisely the same result\" as KR-20 (p.156). Jackson and Ferguson<ref name = JF/> stated that the two formulas are \"identical\"(p.74). Guttman<ref name = Guttman/> said <math> \\lambda_3 </math> is \"algebraically identical\" to KR-20 (p.275). Gulliksen<ref name = Gulliksen/> also admitted that the two formulas are \u201cidentical\u201d(p.224). \n\nEven studies critical of KR-20 did not point out that the original formula of KR-20 could only be applied to dichotomous data.<ref name=c1943>Cronbach, L.

Journal of Educational Psychology, 34(8), 485\u2013494. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0058608</ref>\n\n====Criticism of underestimation of KR-20====\nDevelopers<ref name=KR/> of this formula reported that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> consistently underestimates reliability. Hoyt<ref name=Hoyt2>Hoyt, C. J. (1941). Note on a simplified method of computing test reliability: Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1(1). https://doi.org/10.1177/001316444100100109</ref> argued that this characteristic alone made <math> \\rho_{T}</math> more recommendable than the traditional split-half technique, which was unknown whether to underestimate or overestimate reliability.\n\nCronbach (1943)<ref name =c1943/> was critical of the underestimation of <math> \\rho_{T} </math>. He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated homogeneity of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

Psychometrika, 32(1), 1\u201313. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02289400</ref> proved the necessary and sufficient condition for <math>\\rho_{T}</math> to be equal to reliability, and named it the condition of being essentially tau-equivalent.\n\nCronbach (1978)<ref name = c1978/> mentioned that the reason Cronbach (1951) received a lot of citations was \"mostly because [he] put a brand name on a common-place coefficient\"(p.263)<ref name = Cho />. He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

Educational and Psychological Measurement, 64(3), 391\u2013418. https://doi.org/10.1177/0013164404266386</ref> encouraged readers to use generalizability theory rather than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. He opposed the use of the name Cronbach's alpha. He explicitly denied the existence of existing studies that had published the general formula of KR-20 prior to Cronbach (1951).\n\n== Common misconceptions about tau-equivalent reliability<ref name=ChoKim/>==\n===The value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one===\nBy definition, reliability cannot be less than zero and cannot be greater than one. Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by -1. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math> \\rho_{T}=-3 </math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>-1</math> || <math>-1</math> || <math>1</math>\n|}\nNegative <math>\\rho_{T}</math> can occur for reasons such as negative discrimination or mistakes in processing reversely scored items.\n\nUnlike <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., <math>\\rho_{C}</math>) are always greater than or equal to zero.\n\nThis anomaly was first pointed out by Cronbach (1943)<ref name=c1943/> to criticize <math> \\rho_{T}</math>, but Cronbach (1951)<ref name=Cronbach/> did not comment on this problem in his article, which discussed every topic related <math> \\rho_{T}</math> and he himself<ref name=c2004/> described as being \"encyclopedic\" (p.396).\n\n=== If there is no measurement error, the value of tau-equivalent reliability is one===\nThis anomaly also originates from the fact that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> underestimates reliability. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by two.

This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality. Several studies have provided proofs or counterexamples that high <math> \\rho_{T}</math> values do not indicate unidimensionality.<ref name=Cortina>Cortina, J. M. (1993). What is coefficient alpha?

C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not.

If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha.

The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory.

Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991).

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest. Discover in advance the problem of reliability.\n\nExclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reversely scored items).\n====After data collection====\nRemove the problematic items using \"alpha if item deleted\". However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.\n\nUse a more accurate reliability coefficient than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. For example, <math>\\rho_{C}</math> is .02 larger than <math>\\rho_{T}</math> on average.<ref name=PK/>\n==Which reliability coefficient to use==\n===Should we continue to use tau-equivalent reliability?===\n<math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> is used in an overwhelming proportion.

However, different opinions are given on which reliability coefficient should be used instead of <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>.\n\nDifferent reliability coefficients ranked first in each simulation study<ref name=KTD/><ref name=Osburn/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=TC/><ref name=VVS/> comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients.<ref name=ChoKim/>\n\nThe majority opinion is to use SEM-based reliability coefficients as an alternative to <math> {\\rho} _ {T} </math>.<ref name=Cho/><ref name=ChoKim/><ref name=DBB/><ref name=GY/><ref name=Peters/><ref name=RM/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=YG/>\n\nHowever, there is no consensus on which of the several SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., unidimensional or multidimensional models) is the best to use.\n\nSome people say <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math><ref name=RZ/> as an alternative, but <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> shows information that is completely different from reliability. <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> is a type of coefficient comparable to Revelle's <math>\\beta</math>.<ref name=Revelle/><ref name=RZ/> They do not substitute, but complement reliability.<ref name=Cho/>\n\nAmong SEM-based reliability coefficients, multidimensional reliability coefficients are rarely used, and the most commonly used is <math>{\\rho}_{C}</math> .<ref name = Cho/>\n===Software for SEM-based reliability coefficients===\nGeneral-purpose statistical software such as SPSS and SAS include a function to calculate <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>. Users who don't know the formula of <math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> have no problem in obtaining the estimates with just a few mouse clicks. \n\nSEM software such as AMOS, LISREL, and MPLUS does not have a function to calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients. Users need to calculate the result by inputting it to the formula. To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients.<ref name = Cho/> There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.\n\n1) R (free): The psych package <ref>http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf</ref> calculates various reliability coefficients.\n\n2) EQS (paid)<ref>http://www.mvsoft.com/eqs60.htm</ref>: This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.\n\n3) RelCalc (free)<ref name = Cho/>: Available with Microsoft Excel. <Math>\\rho_C</math> can be obtained without the need for SEM software. Various multidimensional SEM reliability coefficients and various types of <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> can be calculated based on the results of SEM software.\n\n==Derivation of formula<ref name=Cho/>==\nAssumption 1. The observed score of an item consists of the true score of the item and the error of the item, which is independent of the true score. <math>X_i=T_i+e_i</math>\n\nLemma. <math>Cov(T_i,e_i)=Cov(T_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 2. Errors are independent of each other. <math>Cov(e_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 3. (The assumption of being essentially tau-equivalent) The true score of an item consists of the true score common to all items and the constant of the item. <math>T_i=\\mu_i + t</math>\n\nLet <math>T</math> denote the sum of the item true scores. <math>T=\\sum_{i=1}^k T_i</math>\n\nThe variance of <math>T</math> is called the true score variance.\n\nDefinition. Reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. <math>\\rho={\\sigma^2_T \\over \\sigma^2_X}</math>\n\nThe following relationship is established from the above assumptions.\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_i=Var(\\mu_i + t+e_i)=\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_i} (\\because Var(\\mu_i)=Cov(t,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,t)=0)</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma_{ij}=Cov(T_i+e_i, T_j+e_j)=\\sigma^2_t (\\because Cov(T_i,e_j)=Cov(T_j,e_i)=Cov(e_i,e_j)=0)</math>\n\nTherefore, the covariance matrix between items is as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>\\ldots</math>\n! <math>X_k</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_1}</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>||<math>\\ldots</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_2}</math>|| <math>\\ldots</math>|| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>\\vdots</math>\n| <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\ddots</math>|| <math>\\vdots</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_k</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\ldots</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_k}</math>\n|-\n\n|}\nYou can see that <math> \\sigma^2_t</math> equals the mean of the covariances between items.

They did not give the reliability coefficients particular names. Equation 20 in their article is <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. This formula is often referred to as Kuder-Richardson Formula 20, or KR-20. They dealt with cases where the observed scores were dichotomous (e.g., correct or incorrect), so the expression of KR-20 is slightly different from the conventional formula of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. A review of this paper reveals that they did not present a general formula because they did not need to, not because they were not able to. Let <math>p_i</math> denote the correct answer ratio of item <math>i </math>, and <math>q_i</math> denote the incorrect answer ratio of item <math>i</math> (<math>p_i + q_i = 1 </math>).

The assumption he used is essential tau-equivalence in modern terms.\n\n====Recognition of  KR-20's original formula and general formula at the time====\nThe two formulas were recognized to be exactly identical, and the expression of general formula of KR-20 was not used. Hoyt<ref name = Hoyt/> explained that his method \"gives precisely the same result\" as KR-20 (p.156). Jackson and Ferguson<ref name = JF/> stated that the two formulas are \"identical\"(p.74). Guttman<ref name = Guttman/> said <math> \\lambda_3 </math> is \"algebraically identical\" to KR-20 (p.275). Gulliksen<ref name = Gulliksen/> also admitted that the two formulas are \u201cidentical\u201d(p.224). \n\nEven studies critical of KR-20 did not point out that the original formula of KR-20 could only be applied to dichotomous data.<ref name=c1943>Cronbach, L.

Hoyt<ref name=Hoyt2>Hoyt, C. J. (1941). Note on a simplified method of computing test reliability: Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1(1). https://doi.org/10.1177/001316444100100109</ref> argued that this characteristic alone made <math> \\rho_{T}</math> more recommendable than the traditional split-half technique, which was unknown whether to underestimate or overestimate reliability.\n\nCronbach (1943)<ref name =c1943/> was critical of the underestimation of <math> \\rho_{T} </math>. He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated homogeneity of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent.

This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality.

C. (1967). Psychometric theory. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref><ref name=n2>Nunnally, J. C. (1978). Psychometric theory (2nd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref><ref name=n3>Nunnally, J. C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not. Rather than .7, the criterion of .8 referred to applied research by Nunnally is more appropriate for most empirical studies.<ref name=LBM/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\n|+ Nunnally's recommendations on the level of reliability\n|-\n!   !! 1st edition<ref name=n1/> !! 2nd<ref name=n2/> & 3rd<ref name=n3/> edition\n|-\n| Early stage of research|| .5 or .6 || .7\n|-\n| Applied research|| .8 || .8\n|-\n| When making important decisions || .95 (minimum .9) || .95 (minimum .9)\n|}\n\nHis recommendation level did not imply a cutoff point. If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha. Journal of Product Research, 38(1), 9\u201320.</ref>\n\nHis idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.\n\n===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===\nMany textbooks explain that the higher the value of reliability, the better. The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 51(5), 493\u2013504. https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1954.tb00485.x</ref><ref>Humphreys, L. (1956). The normal curve and the attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991). Does item homogeneity indicate internal consistency or item redundancy in psychometric scales? Personality and Individual Differences, 12(3), 291\u2013294. https://doi.org/10.1016/0191-8869(91)90115-R</ref><ref>Streiner, D. L. (2003).

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest. Discover in advance the problem of reliability.\n\nExclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reversely scored items).\n====After data collection====\nRemove the problematic items using \"alpha if item deleted\". However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.\n\nUse a more accurate reliability coefficient than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. For example, <math>\\rho_{C}</math> is .02 larger than <math>\\rho_{T}</math> on average.<ref name=PK/>\n==Which reliability coefficient to use==\n===Should we continue to use tau-equivalent reliability?===\n<math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> is used in an overwhelming proportion. A study estimates that approximately 97% of studies use <math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> as a reliability coefficient<ref name = Cho/>. \n\nHowever, simulation studies comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients have led to the common result that <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> is an inaccurate reliability coefficient.<ref name=KTD>Kamata, A., Turhan, A., & Darandari, E.

However, different opinions are given on which reliability coefficient should be used instead of <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>.\n\nDifferent reliability coefficients ranked first in each simulation study<ref name=KTD/><ref name=Osburn/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=TC/><ref name=VVS/> comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients.<ref name=ChoKim/>\n\nThe majority opinion is to use SEM-based reliability coefficients as an alternative to <math> {\\rho} _ {T} </math>.<ref name=Cho/><ref name=ChoKim/><ref name=DBB/><ref name=GY/><ref name=Peters/><ref name=RM/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=YG/>\n\nHowever, there is no consensus on which of the several SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., unidimensional or multidimensional models) is the best to use.\n\nSome people say <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math><ref name=RZ/> as an alternative, but <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> shows information that is completely different from reliability. <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> is a type of coefficient comparable to Revelle's <math>\\beta</math>.<ref name=Revelle/><ref name=RZ/> They do not substitute, but complement reliability.<ref name=Cho/>\n\nAmong SEM-based reliability coefficients, multidimensional reliability coefficients are rarely used, and the most commonly used is <math>{\\rho}_{C}</math> .<ref name = Cho/>\n===Software for SEM-based reliability coefficients===\nGeneral-purpose statistical software such as SPSS and SAS include a function to calculate <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>. Users who don't know the formula of <math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> have no problem in obtaining the estimates with just a few mouse clicks. \n\nSEM software such as AMOS, LISREL, and MPLUS does not have a function to calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients. Users need to calculate the result by inputting it to the formula. To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients.<ref name = Cho/> There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.\n\n1) R (free): The psych package <ref>http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf</ref> calculates various reliability coefficients.\n\n2) EQS (paid)<ref>http://www.mvsoft.com/eqs60.htm</ref>: This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.\n\n3) RelCalc (free)<ref name = Cho/>: Available with Microsoft Excel. <Math>\\rho_C</math> can be obtained without the need for SEM software. Various multidimensional SEM reliability coefficients and various types of <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> can be calculated based on the results of SEM software.\n\n==Derivation of formula<ref name=Cho/>==\nAssumption 1. The observed score of an item consists of the true score of the item and the error of the item, which is independent of the true score. <math>X_i=T_i+e_i</math>\n\nLemma. <math>Cov(T_i,e_i)=Cov(T_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 2. Errors are independent of each other. <math>Cov(e_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 3. (The assumption of being essentially tau-equivalent) The true score of an item consists of the true score common to all items and the constant of the item. <math>T_i=\\mu_i + t</math>\n\nLet <math>T</math> denote the sum of the item true scores. <math>T=\\sum_{i=1}^k T_i</math>\n\nThe variance of <math>T</math> is called the true score variance.\n\nDefinition. Reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. <math>\\rho={\\sigma^2_T \\over \\sigma^2_X}</math>\n\nThe following relationship is established from the above assumptions.\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_i=Var(\\mu_i + t+e_i)=\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_i} (\\because Var(\\mu_i)=Cov(t,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,t)=0)</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma_{ij}=Cov(T_i+e_i, T_j+e_j)=\\sigma^2_t (\\because Cov(T_i,e_j)=Cov(T_j,e_i)=Cov(e_i,e_j)=0)</math>\n\nTherefore, the covariance matrix between items is as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>\\ldots</math>\n! <math>X_k</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_1}</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>||<math>\\ldots</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_2}</math>|| <math>\\ldots</math>|| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>\\vdots</math>\n| <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\ddots</math>|| <math>\\vdots</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_k</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\ldots</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_k}</math>\n|-\n\n|}\nYou can see that <math> \\sigma^2_t</math> equals the mean of the covariances between items.

He was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1895 to 1897, and the [[List of Governors of New York|32nd Governor of New York]] from 1897 to 1898.\n\n==Early life==\nBlack was born near [[Limington, Maine|Limington, York County, Maine]] on March 8, 1853, one of eleven children born to farmer Jacob Black and Charlotte (Butters) Black.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} His father moved the family to [[Alfred, Maine]] after accepting an appointment as keeper of the [[York County, Maine|York County]] jail.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} Black graduated from [[Lebanon, Maine|Lebanon]] Academy in 1871, then taught school while attending [[Dartmouth College]].{{sfn|''American Biography''}} He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1875, was an editor of all three of the school's student publications, and won prizes for oratory.{{sfn|''American Biography''}}{{sfn|''Catalogue of the Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity''}} While in college, Black joined the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity.{{sfn|''Catalogue of the Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity''}}\n\n==Start of career==\nAfter completing his education, Black moved [[Rome, New York]], where he sold [[Chromolithography|Chromolithographs]].{{sfn|''American Biography''}} He soon moved to [[Johnstown (city), New York|Johnstown, New York]] to become editor of the ''Johnstown Journal''.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} A member of the [[Half-Breeds (politics)|Half-Breed]] faction of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and follower of [[James G. Blaine]],{{sfn|''Bulletin to the Schools''}} Black changed the political stance of the paper while its Democratic owner was out of town, for which he was promptly fired.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} He then moved to [[Troy, New York]], where he worked for the ''Troy Whig'' and ''Troy Times''.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} While working as a night reporter, he was a clerk in the Troy post office and [[reading law|studied law]] with the firm of Robertson & Foster.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} Black attained [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] in 1879 and began to practice in Troy.{{sfn|''American Biography''}}\n\nIn 1888, Black campaigned for [[Benjamin Harrison]] for president.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} In 1892, he campaigned for Harrison's reelection, but Harrison was defeated by former President [[Grover Cleveland]].{{sfn|''American Biography''}} In March 1894, an election day dispute between Republicans and Democrats in Troy culminated with the [[murder of Robert Ross]], a Republican.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} Black assisted in the prosecution of the defendants, Democrats Bartholomew \"Bat\" Shea and John McGough, who were convicted. McGough was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Shea was executed.\n\n==U.S. House==\nLargely as a result of the Ross murder case, in November 1894, Black was elected to the [[54th United States Congress]], representing [[New York's 19th congressional district]].{{sfn|''American Biography''}} He served from March 4, 1895 to January 7, 1897, when he resigned because he had been elected governor.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} During his House term, Black was a member of the Committee on Pacific Railroads and the Committee on Private Land Claims.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} He was a delegate to the [[1896 Republican National Convention]] and supported [[William McKinley]] for president.\n\n==Governor==\nBlack was elected governor [[New York state election, 1896|in 1896]] and served from January 1, 1897 to December 31, 1898.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} A highlight of his governorship was completion of construction on the [[New York State Capitol]], which had fallen far behind schedule and had been plagued with cost overruns.{{sfn|''American Biography''}}\n\nAs governor, Black advocated for conservation of the area now known as the [[Adirondack State Park]].{{sfn|''American Biography''}} As part of this effort, he oversaw the establishment of the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry]].{{sfn|''American Biography''}} During Black's governorship, the boroughs that now make up [[New York City]] were consolidated into one municipality.{{sfn|''American Biography''}}\n\nBlack also oversaw New York's participation in the [[Spanish-American War]].{{sfn|''American Biography''}} Under his leadership, 16,000 soldiers were raised, trained, and equipped for accession into the [[United States Army]] as it expanded for the war.{{sfn|''American Biography''}} In addition, he successfully advocated for election reforms, including allowing soldiers to vote while they out of state or outside the United States.{{sfn|''American Biography''}}\n\nIn 1896, Black had been nominated for governor by Republican political operative Louis F. Payn, who was widely regarded as a corrupt associate of [[Thomas C. Platt]], the boss of New York State's Republican Party. As governor, Black caused a controversy when appointed Payn as [[New York State Insurance Department|state insurance superintendent]]. Despite criticism from advocates of good government and civil service reform, Black continued to support Payn. Despite backing Payn, Black incurred Platt's displeasure when Black successfully opposed a bill Platt favored, which would have banned from newspapers editorial cartoons critical of state government officials.\n\nLate in Black's term, state officials were accused of squandering more than a million dollars on a project to expand the [[Erie Canal]], which had come to be regarded as a [[boondoggle]] because of delays and excessive costs. Black's chances for reelection were jeopardized, so Republicans replaced him as their 1898 gubernatorial nominee with [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who had recently attained hero status in Cuba during the [[Spanish-American War]]. Roosevelt won the November general election by narrowly defeating Democratic nominee [[Augustus Van Wyck]]. In 1899, an investigating commission appointed by Black, in conjunction with two special counsels appointed by Roosevelt, exonerated those involved of criminal wrongdoing.\n\n==Later life==\nAfterwards he resumed his law practice. Among the noteworthy cases in which he was involved, Black took part in the defense of Roland B. Molineaux in the famed ''[[People v. Molineux]]'' case. After Molineaux was convicted of murder, the conviction was overturned and he won an acquittal at retrial. The case was the source of the well-known \"Molineux rule\" which limits the ability of prosecutors to use prior crimes as proof that a defendant committed the crime with which he is charged. Black also took part in the defense of [[Caleb Powers]] for the assassination of Kentucky governor [[William Goebel]].\n\nBlack maintained his interest in politics even after leaving office. In 1904, he was a candidate for the Republican nomination for [[United States Senator]], but lost to incumbent [[Chauncey Depew]], who went on to win reelection. He was a delegate to the [[1904 Republican National Convention]], and nominated President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] for election to a full term. In 1908, Black supported William Howard Taft for president.\n\n==Death and burial==\nBlack died from heart disease at his home in Troy on March 22, 1913. He was cremated and his ashes were buried at his farm outside [[Freedom, New Hampshire]].\n\n==Family==\nIn 1879, Black married Lois B. Hamlin (1858-1931) of [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], whom he had met while teaching school in Provincetown. They were the parents of a son, Arthur (1880-1953).\n\n==Honors==\nIn 1898, Black received the [[honorary degree]] of [[Legum Doctor|LL.D.]] from Dartmouth College.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n===Books===\n*{{cite book |editor-last=Cutter |editor-first=William Richard |date=1918 |title=American Biography: A New Cyclopedia |volume=II |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tmoKAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA347 |location=New York, NY |publisher=The American Historical Society |pages=347-348 |via=[[Google Books]] |ref={{sfnRef|''American Biography''}}}}\n*{{cite book |last=Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity |date=1890 |title=Catalogue of the Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Feo140qPrb4C&pg=PA675 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Council Publishing Company |page=675 |via=[[Google Books]] |ref={{sfnRef|''Catalogue of the Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity''}}}}\n\n===Magazines===\n*{{cite magazine |date=September 15, 1923 |title=Governors of New York: Frank S.
