Australia's first guns were landed from {{HMS|Sirius|1786|6}} and a small earthen redoubt built, near the present day [[Macquarie Place]], to command the approaches to [[Sydney Cove]]. The deployment of these guns represents the origins of [[artillery]] in Australia. These and subsequent defences, as well as field guns, were operated by marines and the soldiers of infantry regiments stationed in Australia. The first [[Royal Regiment of Artillery|Royal Artillery]] unit arrived in Australia in 1856 and began a succession of gunner units which ended with the withdrawal of the imperial forces in 1870 resulting in the raising of the Victorian Artillery Corps in Melbourne in 1870 and the New South Wales Artillery in Sydney in 1871. The First World War saw the raising of 60 [[Field artillery|field]], 20 [[howitzer]] and two siege batteries along with the heavy and medium trench [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] batteries. Until 19 September 1962 the Australian Artillery was referred to as the 'Royal Australian Artillery', however on this date [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|HM Queen Elizabeth II]] granted the RAA the title of 'The Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery'. The Regiment today consists of Regular and Reserve units.\n\n{{Australian Army Arms}}\n\n==Regular Army==\nUnlike their [[Royal Artillery|British]] and [[Royal Canadian Artillery|Canadian]] equivalents, there are no regiments of [[horse artillery]] in the [[order of battle]] of the Royal Australian Artillery. The [[Australian Army|Australian Regular Army]] came into being in 1947, while prior to this artillery units were predominantly [[Militia#Australia|militia]] based. The permanent artillery consisted of one field battery, [[A Field Battery, Royal Australian Artillery|'A' Field Battery]], which now perpetuates the New South Wales Artillery raised on 1 August 1871, HQ P Anti-Aircraft Battery with 1st, 2nd and 3rd AA Cadres under command, the independent 4th and 5th AA Cadres, HQ 1st, 2nd and 3rd Heavy Brigades and the 1st to 13th Heavy Batteries.<ref>The Army List, Part I, 1 February 1939</ref> Prior to the Second World War heavy artillery, later called [[coast artillery]], units were established at strategic locations around the coastline, however these units were progressively phased out by 1962. During the Second World War, the RAA raised in excess of 70 regiments of field, medium, anti-tank, anti-aircraft and survey artillery, and in excess of 200 anti-aircraft and coast artillery batteries with their attendant anti-aircraft group or fire command headquarters in the fixed defences. Many saw action in the Middle East, Malaya and Southwest Pacific theatres, with two field regiments, one anti-tank regiment, one independent anti-tank battery, an anti-aircraft battery and two coast batteries being captured by the Japanese in Singapore, Ambon, Timor and New Britain while serving as part of the [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Division]].\n\nThe present [[School of Artillery (Australia)|School of Artillery]] (completed in 1998) is located in [[Puckapunyal]] in central [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and maintains modern training facilities.

The silver plaque fixed to the Banner pike reads \"Presented by Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Captain General of The Regiment of Royal Australian Artillery, to replace the Banner presented by His Majesty King Edward VII and in Honour of the Centenary of the Regiment 1971.\"<ref name=\"RAA SO 2014\">RAA SO 2014</ref>\n\nThe King's Banner was presented in November 1904 by the Governor General [[Henry Northcote, 1st Baron Northcote|Lord Northcote]].<ref>General Order No 243 of 20 October 1904</ref> The silver plaque reads \"Presented by His Gracious Majesty the King Emperor to the Royal Australian Artillery in recognition of the services rendered to the Empire in South Africa 1904\". The artillery units or sub-units that served in this war were A Battery, NSW Regiment RAA, and the Machine Gun Section, Queensland Regiment RAA, although many Gunners, permanent and militia, enlisted in the various colonial contingents, and after Federation the battalions of Australian Commonwealth Horse, that served in South Africa.\n\n==Traditions==\n* Battle Honour \u2013 UBIQUE \u2013 Latin :meaning \"Everywhere\".<ref>RAA Standing Orders 2014</ref>\n* Captain General of the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery \u2013 Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.<ref name=\"RAA SO 2014\"/>\n* Head of Regiment \u2013 the senior serving RAA officer who is appointed by the Chief of Army to be his adviser on RAA Regimental matters.<ref name=\"RAA SO 2014\"/>\n* Motto \u2013 \"QUO FAS ET GLORIA DUCUNT\" \u2013 Meaning 'Whither right and glory lead'. The motto of the RAA from 1903 was CONSENSU STABILES, meaning \"Strong in Agreement\", previously carried by the Queensland Regiment of RAA.<ref name=\"RAA SO 2014\"/> The permanent, militia and volunteer artillery units of the Australian colonies and the Australian Commonwealth have carried many mottoes in the past. The motto QUO FAS ET GLORIA DUCUNT was granted to the RAA by HM King George VI in December 1949 and notification of approval was given in AAO 6/1950.<ref name=\"RAA SO 2014\"/>\n* The Regimental Colours \u2013 In times past infantry Regiments carried Colours to serve as rallying points in battle. The rallying point in battle for Gunners is their guns. Thus the guns are the artillery Colours. Abandoning guns is, in the Artillery considered tantamount to abandoning colours in other combat Corps although in reality the RAA has had to abandon guns on several occasions in the past as a result of their destruction or their inability to be removed from their gun positions. There has been no shame associated with these actions, in all cases the guns are rendered unserviceable prior to abandonment.\n* Current Australian manufactured guns symbolically have the national Coat of Arms engraved on the barrels.\n* Troops stand to attention when being passed by the guns when on parade as the guns are the ceremonial colours of Artillery.\n* It is considered rude and insulting to the colours to lean on or rest against a gun.\n* Patron Saint \u2013 [[Saint Barbara]], Protector from fire and explosion.\n* Regimental Birthday \u2013 1 August.\n* Regimental Marching Tune \u2013 \"[[The British Grenadiers]]\".\n* Takes precedence on parade after units of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps. Artillery units on parade with their guns take place to the right of units parading without their guns.<ref name=\"RAA SO 2014\"/> \n* The hat badge of the Royal Australian Artillery was approved in June 1930 with the battle honour UBIQUE in the upper scroll surmounted by an Imperial crown, and the motto CONSENSU STABILES and the word AUSTRALIA in the lower scrolls. In 1951 a design with QUO FAS ET GLORIA DUCUNT replaced the wording in the lower scrolls but this was never manufactured or issued. The current design with the St Edwards crown and QUO FAS ET GLORIA DUCUNT in the lower scrolls was approved in 1954.<ref name=\"RAA SO 2014\"/>\n* Officers and Warrant Officers Class One wear a bursting 7-flamed grenade with a scroll bearing the Battle Honour UBIQUE on the collars of ceremonial uniforms. Other ranks wear a collar badge comprising the cypher 'RAA' above a scroll bearing the RAA motto.<ref name=\"RAA SO 2014\"/>\n* Ceremonial colours \u2013 Red over blue.\n* Regimental lanyard colour \u2013 White.<ref>Army Standing Orders for Dress</ref> This colour was officially adopted in 1952 by officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers of the RAA who were required to carry whistles as part of their duties and the lanyard was worn looped around the right shoulder. <ref>Standing Orders for Dress 1952</ref> In 1950, officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers of the RAA required to carry whistles in the exercise of their command functions had been authorised to wear a braided scarlet lanyard but although the item was supplied, it is thought that this instruction was widely ignored.<ref>NAA: SP1008/1; 544/2/7118, Lanyards, Whistle, Braided, Military Board (MGO) letter B2531 of 10 Mar 50, para 3</ref> In 1956 wearing of the white lanyard was extended to all ranks.<ref>Standing Orders for Dress 1958</ref> A Battery RAA were given permission to wear their lanyard on the left shoulder in 1963, confirming an unofficial practice continued from 1931, and perpetuating a local authority for other ranks of both 7th Light Horse Regiment and the then 1st Battery, Royal Australian Field Artillery, to wear a white lanyard while they were functioning as the escort to the Duke of York, the future King George VI, when he opened the first Parliament in Canberra in 1927.<ref>Army Dress Manual 1963</ref> The first lanyards issued to Australian artillerymen, from as early as 1886, were for permanent gunners to carry their clasp knife and were never worn on full dress or ceremonial uniform nor were they worn by officers. They were never bleached or blancoed white and do not appear to have been worn looped around the shoulder. During the Great War gunners of the Australian Imperial Force serving abroad began to unofficially adopt white or khaki braided cord lanyards, or plaited leather lanyards, on their best uniforms while on leave or for carrying whistles. There was no laid down policy and these were worn on either left or right shoulder according to personal preference. After the war the practice was continued by other ranks of the permanent and militia artillery and the lanyard was usually worn on the left shoulder. This practice was unofficial although in 1925 personnel who carried whistles on duty were allowed to wear lanyards in the colour of the uniform, i.e., khaki.<ref>Standing Orders for Clothing, Part 3, 1925</ref> In 1931 these lanyards were authorised to be worn on the right shoulder although 1st Field Cadre RAA continued to wear them on the left.<ref>Standing Orders for Dress 1931</ref> White lanyards were worn unofficially by artillery, light horse, Corps of Signals, infantry, and Australian Army Service Corps, during the 1920s and 1930s and the practice ceased at the start of the Second World War. The Australian Tank Corps wore it on the left shoulder during the 1930s. The white lanyard worn by the Royal Australian Artillery has nothing whatsoever to do with the Boer War, nor was it ever used for carrying pocket knives or fuze keys. It began being worn unofficially as an embellishment during the Great War, became a functional item for carrying whistles after the Second World War, and subsequently reverted to an embellishment.\n\n==Affiliations==\n*{{GBR}} \u2013 [[Royal Regiment of Artillery]]\n*{{CAN}} \u2013 [[Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery]]\n*{{NZL}} \u2013 [[Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery]]\n\n==Order of precedence==\n{{s-start}}\n{{order of precedence\n| before = [[Royal Australian Armoured Corps]]\n| title  = [[List of Australian Army Corps|Australian Army Order of Precedence]]\n| after  = [[Royal Australian Engineers]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Australian Army Artillery Units, World War I]]\n*[[Australian Army Artillery Museum]]\n*[[List of guns and mortars used by the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery]]\n\n==References==\n{{commonscat|Artillery of Australia}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Australian army units with royal patronage|Regiment of Australian Artillery, Royal]]\n[[Category:Artillery regiments of Australia]]\n[[Category:Australian Army Corps|Artillery]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1901]]\n[[Category:1901 establishments in Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=May 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2013}}\n{{Infobox military unit\n| unit_name              = Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery\n| image                  = Royal Artillery Cap Badge.jpg\n| image_size             = 200px\n| caption                = Cap badge of the Royal Australian Artillery\n| country                = Australia\n| type                   = [[Artillery]]\n| branch                 = [[Australian Army]]\n| dates                  = 1 March 1901 \u2013 present\n| specialisation         = Field Artillery (3 regiments)<br>Air Defence (1 regiment)<br>Surveillance and Target Acquisition (1 regiment)\n| command_structure      = \n| size                   = Six Regiments\n| current_commander      = \n| garrison               = \n| ceremonial_chief       = [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|HM The Queen]]\n| ceremonial_chief_label = Captain-General\n| nickname               = ''The 9 Mile Snipers''\n| motto                  = ''Ubique | Quo Fas et Gloria Ducunt'' (Everywhere | Where right and glory lead)\n| colors                 = \n| march                  = Quick \u2013 ''Royal Artillery Quick March''<br>Slow \u2013 ''Royal Artillery Slow March''\n| mascot                 = \n| battles                = \n| notable_commanders     = \n| anniversaries          = 1 August (Regimental Birthday).\n| identification_symbol  = Red over blue.\n| identification_symbol_label = \n| identification_symbol_2 = \n| identification_symbol_2_label = \n}}\nThe '''Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery''', normally referred to as the '''Royal Australian Artillery''' ('''RAA'''), is a Regiment of the [[Australian Army]] descended from the original [[Colonial forces of Australia|colonial artillery]] units prior to [[Federation of Australia|Australia's federation]].

The silver plaque fixed to the Banner pike reads \"Presented by Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Captain General of The Regiment of Royal Australian Artillery, to replace the Banner presented by His Majesty King Edward VII and in Honour of the Centenary of the Regiment 1971.\"<ref name=\"RAA SO 2014\">RAA SO 2014</ref>\n\nThe King's Banner was presented in November 1904 by the Governor General [[Henry Northcote, 1st Baron Northcote|Lord Northcote]].<ref>General Order No 243 of 20 October 1904</ref> The silver plaque reads \"Presented by His Gracious Majesty the King Emperor to the Royal Australian Artillery in recognition of the services rendered to the Empire in South Africa 1904\". The artillery units or sub-units that served in this war were A Battery, NSW Regiment RAA, and the Machine Gun Section, Queensland Regiment RAA, although many Gunners, permanent and militia, enlisted in the various colonial contingents, and after Federation the battalions of Australian Commonwealth Horse, that served in South Africa.\n\n==Traditions==\n* Battle Honour \u2013 UBIQUE \u2013 Latin :meaning \"Everywhere\".<ref>RAA Standing Orders 2014</ref>\n* Captain General of the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery \u2013 Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.<ref name=\"RAA SO 2014\"/>\n* Head of Regiment \u2013 the senior serving RAA officer who is appointed by the Chief of Army to be his adviser on RAA Regimental matters.<ref name=\"RAA SO 2014\"/>\n* Motto \u2013 \"QUO FAS ET GLORIA DUCUNT\" \u2013 Meaning 'Whither right and glory lead'. The motto of the RAA from 1903 was CONSENSU STABILES, meaning \"Strong in Agreement\", previously carried by the Queensland Regiment of RAA.<ref name=\"RAA SO 2014\"/> The permanent, militia and volunteer artillery units of the Australian colonies and the Australian Commonwealth have carried many mottoes in the past. The motto QUO FAS ET GLORIA DUCUNT was granted to the RAA by HM King George VI in December 1949 and notification of approval was given in AAO 6/1950.<ref name=\"RAA SO 2014\"/>\n* The Regimental Colours \u2013 In times past infantry Regiments carried Colours to serve as rallying points in battle. The rallying point in battle for Gunners is their guns. Thus the guns are the artillery Colours. Abandoning guns is, in the Artillery considered tantamount to abandoning colours in other combat Corps although in reality the RAA has had to abandon guns on several occasions in the past as a result of their destruction or their inability to be removed from their gun positions. There has been no shame associated with these actions, in all cases the guns are rendered unserviceable prior to abandonment.\n* Current Australian manufactured guns symbolically have the national Coat of Arms engraved on the barrels.\n* Troops stand to attention when being passed by the guns when on parade as the guns are the ceremonial colours of Artillery.\n* It is considered rude and insulting to the colours to lean on or rest against a gun.\n* Patron Saint \u2013 [[Saint Barbara]], Protector from fire and explosion.\n* Regimental Birthday \u2013 1 August.\n* Regimental Marching Tune \u2013 \"[[The British Grenadiers]]\".\n* Takes precedence on parade after units of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps. Artillery units on parade with their guns take place to the right of units parading without their guns.<ref name=\"RAA SO 2014\"/> \n* The hat badge of the Royal Australian Artillery was approved in June 1930 with the battle honour UBIQUE in the upper scroll surmounted by an Imperial crown, and the motto CONSENSU STABILES and the word AUSTRALIA in the lower scrolls. In 1951 a design with QUO FAS ET GLORIA DUCUNT replaced the wording in the lower scrolls but this was never manufactured or issued. The current design with the St Edwards crown and QUO FAS ET GLORIA DUCUNT in the lower scrolls was approved in 1954.<ref name=\"RAA SO 2014\"/>\n* Officers and Warrant Officers Class One wear a bursting 7-flamed grenade with a scroll bearing the Battle Honour UBIQUE on the collars of ceremonial uniforms. Other ranks wear a collar badge comprising the cypher 'RAA' above a scroll bearing the RAA motto.<ref name=\"RAA SO 2014\"/>\n* Ceremonial colours \u2013 Red over blue.\n* Regimental lanyard colour \u2013 White.<ref>Army Standing Orders for Dress</ref> This colour was officially adopted in 1952 by officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers of the RAA who were required to carry whistles as part of their duties and the lanyard was worn looped around the right shoulder. <ref>Standing Orders for Dress 1952</ref> In 1950, officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers of the RAA required to carry whistles in the exercise of their command functions had been authorised to wear a braided scarlet lanyard but although the item was supplied, it is thought that this instruction was widely ignored.<ref>NAA: SP1008/1; 544/2/7118, Lanyards, Whistle, Braided, Military Board (MGO) letter B2531 of 10 Mar 50, para 3</ref> In 1956 wearing of the white lanyard was extended to all ranks.<ref>Standing Orders for Dress 1958</ref> A Battery RAA were given permission to wear their lanyard on the left shoulder in 1963, confirming an unofficial practice continued from 1931, and perpetuating a local authority for other ranks of both 7th Light Horse Regiment and the then 1st Battery, Royal Australian Field Artillery, to wear a white lanyard while they were functioning as the escort to the Duke of York, the future King George VI, when he opened the first Parliament in Canberra in 1927.<ref>Army Dress Manual 1963</ref> The first lanyards issued to Australian artillerymen, from as early as 1886, were for permanent gunners to carry their clasp knife and were never worn on full dress or ceremonial uniform nor were they worn by officers. They were never bleached or blancoed white and do not appear to have been worn looped around the shoulder. During the Great War gunners of the Australian Imperial Force serving abroad began to unofficially adopt white or khaki braided cord lanyards, or plaited leather lanyards, on their best uniforms while on leave or for carrying whistles. There was no laid down policy and these were worn on either left or right shoulder according to personal preference. After the war the practice was continued by other ranks of the permanent and militia artillery and the lanyard was usually worn on the left shoulder. This practice was unofficial although in 1925 personnel who carried whistles on duty were allowed to wear lanyards in the colour of the uniform, i.e., khaki.<ref>Standing Orders for Clothing, Part 3, 1925</ref> In 1931 these lanyards were authorised to be worn on the right shoulder although 1st Field Cadre RAA continued to wear them on the left.<ref>Standing Orders for Dress 1931</ref> White lanyards were worn unofficially by artillery, light horse, Corps of Signals, infantry, and Australian Army Service Corps, during the 1920s and 1930s and the practice ceased at the start of the Second World War. The Australian Tank Corps wore it on the left shoulder during the 1930s. The white lanyard worn by the Royal Australian Artillery has nothing whatsoever to do with the Boer War, nor was it ever used for carrying pocket knives or fuze keys. It began being worn unofficially as an embellishment during the Great War, became a functional item for carrying whistles after the Second World War, and subsequently reverted to an embellishment.\n\n==Affiliations==\n*{{GBR}} \u2013 [[Royal Regiment of Artillery]]\n*{{CAN}} \u2013 [[Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery]]\n*{{NZL}} \u2013 [[Royal Regiment of New Zealand Artillery]]\n\n==Order of precedence==\n{{s-start}}\n{{order of precedence\n| before = [[Royal Australian Armoured Corps]]\n| title  = [[List of Australian Army Corps|Australian Army Order of Precedence]]\n| after  = [[Royal Australian Engineers]]\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Australian Army Artillery Units, World War I]]\n*[[Australian Army Artillery Museum]]\n*[[List of guns and mortars used by the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery]]\n\n==References==\n{{commonscat|Artillery of Australia}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Australian army units with royal patronage|Regiment of Australian Artillery, Royal]]\n[[Category:Artillery regiments of Australia]]\n[[Category:Australian Army Corps|Artillery]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1901]]\n[[Category:1901 establishments in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Hammersfan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRegular Army", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Artillery"}

In 1957, he relocated to [[Amsterdam]]. While there, Armando, an artist and friend of Brouwn, introduced him to the [[Zero (art)|Zero movement]]. They were a group of artists who deferred from the style other artists often applied to their works. Brouwn's first works coincided with his introduction to this movement.

His career as an artist flourished after he was introduced to the Zero movement by Armando. The Zero movement, a group of artists who rejected the role of authorship upon their works, is largely responsible for the [[anonymity]] Brouwn demonstrated throughout his career. In the early 1960s, Brouwn produced his first works. These consisted of iron and wooden [[sculpture]]. He also used suspended polythene bags filled with garbage. Few of these early works have survived, as Brouwn destroyed most of them. \n\nEventually, Brouwn began to consider the role of the audience in the development of artwork.

In 2005, a retrospective collection of Brouwn's works was exhibited in the [[Van Abbemuseum|Van Abbe Museum]] in Eindhoven, Netherlands.

It was both a conceptual and [[performance art]] piece that consisted of Brouwn asking passers-by for directions, recording their responses on tape or encouraging them to draw their directions.

Each cabinet consisted of varied numbers of white cards. One of these cabinets held 1000 cards, an outline of a 3000-step walk and the length of the strides between 840 and 890 millimetres.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.impossibleobjectsmarfa.com/fragments-2/stanley-brouwn|title=STANLEY BROUWN|website=Impossible objects|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>\n\nBrouwn also explored the concept of deformation. In 1974, he drew lines constructing borders upon three sheets of paper. Each of these lines denoted the length of a step. If these sheets were hung together, a movement in a single direction could be observed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.impossibleobjectsmarfa.com/fragments-2/stanley-brouwn|title=STANLEY BROUWN|website=Impossible objects|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Later works and exhibitions ===\nBrouwn's works gained fame and earned him positions in a variety of prestigious exhibitions.
