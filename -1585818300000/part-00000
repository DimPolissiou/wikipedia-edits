Unlike other schools that base placement entirely on grades, the University of Missouri School of Law uses a write-on system.  After final exams in the spring semester are completed, packets are made available to all interested students.  In the packet are two assignments: the first is a case and exclusive list of citations to other sources; and the second is a mock list of footnotes.  Applicants to the law journals must write a case note based on the case in the packet, using as citations only those sources specifically listed.  Applicants must also edit the mock list of footnotes for errors, pursuant to the [[Bluebook]] method of citation.  Applicants must then return the entire packet, as well as a list identifying their preferred law journals.\n\nThe Editors-in-Chief and other editors blind-grade the submissions.  Law school administrative assistants rank each student three times: first, by weighting the applicants' GPAs at 80% and their written submissions 20%; then, by weighting the GPAs at 20% and the written submissions at 80%; lastly, by ranking solely based on the scores of the written submissions.  The Editors-in-Chief then select which applicants they want.  The Missouri Law Review selects first based on the 80/20 rankings, then the ''Journal of Dispute Resolution'', then the ''Business, Entrepreneurship & Tax Law Review'' (formerly the ''Journal of Environmental and Sustainability Law'').  Then, they pick again in order, this time based on the 20/80 rankings, and finally they select based on the 0/100 rankings.<ref>[http://law.missouri.edu/lawreview/membership/ Membership on the Missouri Law Reviews]</ref>\n\n=== Missouri Law Review ===<!--Law review should be first, regardless of position in alphabet. A law school's main law review is almost always the most prestigious journal.-->\nThe ''Missouri Law Review'' is the law school's oldest law journal.  It is entirely student-run and student-edited and publishes four times a year.  Since 1936, when publication began, it has been cited over sixteen hundred times in published court opinions, including over twenty occasions by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].<ref>[http://law.missouri.edu/lawreview/about/ About the Missouri Law Review]</ref>\n\nEach spring the law review hosts a symposium on a different part of the law.  Noted scholars and practitioners in the given area give a presentation, and then they write an article which the law review publishes later that year.\n\n=== Business, Entrepreneurship & Tax Law Review ===\nThe ''Business, Entrepreneurship & Tax Law Review'' (\"BETR\") is a student-edited and led publication that creates a three-part publication and hosts an annual symposium providing cutting-edge information and legal analysis over a wide range of issues. \n\n=== Journal of Dispute Resolution ===\nThe ''Journal of Dispute Resolution'', operated by the Center for the Study of Dispute Resolution, is entirely student-led and student-edited.  Published semi-annually, the Journal is considered the leading publication in alternative dispute resolution. The Journal, like the ''Missouri Law Review'', hosts annual symposia in the area of dispute resolution.\n\n=== Journal of Environmental and Sustainability Law ===\nThe ''Journal of Environmental and Sustainability Law'', or JESL, formerly known as the ''Missouri Environmental Law & Policy Review'', was a joint venture between the School of Law and the [[Missouri Bar Association]]. Founded in 1993, JESL  consisted of 11 student editors and no more than 20 student associates.\n\nJESL published case notes and articles on topics including energy policy, land use, water policy, agricultural law, land reclamation, and environmental sustainability. From its inception in 1993 to the 2010-2011 school year, it published three editions each year. Beginning in the 2011-2012 school year, two issues per year are published, one each in the fall and spring. The journal's last issue was published in spring 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://law.missouri.edu/jesl/|title=Home Page - Journal of Environmental & Sustainability Law|website=law.missouri.edu|access-date=2018-09-04}}</ref>\n\n== Employment ==\nAccording to Mizzou Law's official 2016 ABA-required disclosures, 82% of the Class of 2016 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.missouri.edu/careers/employment-statistics/ |title=Employment Statistics}}</ref> Mizzou Law's [[Law School Transparency]] under-employment score is 17.7%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2016 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lstreports.com/schools/missouri/ |title=University of Missouri - Columbia Profile}}</ref>\n\n==Costs==\nFor the 2019-2020 school year, in-state tuition is $22,218.95, and out-of-state tuition is $41,079.35.<ref>{{cite http://law.missouri.edu/financialaid/cost/}}</ref>  The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Mizzou Law for the 2014-2015 academic year is $55,106 for non-Missouri residents and $34,476.30 for Missouri residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.missouri.edu/financialaid/cost/ |title=Tuition and Expenses}}</ref> The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $212,935 for non-Missouri residents and $143,714 for Missouri residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lstscorereports.com/schools/missouri/costs/2013/ |title=University of Missouri - Columbia Profile}}</ref>  \n\nIn 2017, the school was recognized and ranked 21st by ''The National Jurist'' and ''preLaw Magazine'' as one of the nation's best valued law schools. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://bluetoad.com/publication/frame.php?i=443086&p=22&pn=&ver=html5|title=The National Jurist Fall 2017 Page 22|access-date=2018-09-04}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Faculty==\n\n*[[Royce de rohan Barondes]] (contracts & business organizations)\n*[[Dennis Crouch|Dennis D.

Unlike other schools that base placement entirely on grades, the University of Missouri School of Law uses a write-on system.  After final exams in the spring semester are completed, packets are made available to all interested students.  In the packet are two assignments: the first is a case and exclusive list of citations to other sources; and the second is a mock list of footnotes.  Applicants to the law journals must write a case note based on the case in the packet, using as citations only those sources specifically listed.  Applicants must also edit the mock list of footnotes for errors, pursuant to the [[Bluebook]] method of citation.  Applicants must then return the entire packet, as well as a list identifying their preferred law journals.\n\nThe Editors-in-Chief and other editors blind-grade the submissions.  Law school administrative assistants rank each student three times: first, by weighting the applicants' GPAs at 80% and their written submissions 20%; then, by weighting the GPAs at 20% and the written submissions at 80%; lastly, by ranking solely based on the scores of the written submissions.  The Editors-in-Chief then select which applicants they want.  The Missouri Law Review selects first based on the 80/20 rankings, then the ''Journal of Dispute Resolution'', then the ''Business, Entrepreneurship & Tax Law Review'' (formerly the ''Journal of Environmental and Sustainability Law'').  Then, they pick again in order, this time based on the 20/80 rankings, and finally they select based on the 0/100 rankings.<ref>[http://law.missouri.edu/lawreview/membership/ Membership on the Missouri Law Reviews]</ref>\n\n=== Missouri Law Review ===<!--Law review should be first, regardless of position in alphabet. A law school's main law review is almost always the most prestigious journal.-->\nThe ''Missouri Law Review'' is the law school's oldest law journal.  It is entirely student-run and student-edited and publishes four times a year.  Since 1936, when publication began, it has been cited over sixteen hundred times in published court opinions, including over twenty occasions by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].<ref>[http://law.missouri.edu/lawreview/about/ About the Missouri Law Review]</ref>\n\nEach spring the law review hosts a symposium on a different part of the law.  Noted scholars and practitioners in the given area give a presentation, and then they write an article which the law review publishes later that year.\n\n=== Business, Entrepreneurship & Tax Law Review ===\nThe ''Business, Entrepreneurship & Tax Law Review'' (\"BETR\") is a student-edited and led publication that creates a three-part publication and hosts an annual symposium providing cutting-edge information and legal analysis over a wide range of issues. \n\n=== Journal of Dispute Resolution ===\nThe ''Journal of Dispute Resolution'', operated by the Center for the Study of Dispute Resolution, is entirely student-led and student-edited.  Published semi-annually, the Journal is considered the leading publication in alternative dispute resolution. The Journal, like the ''Missouri Law Review'', hosts annual symposia in the area of dispute resolution.\n\n=== Journal of Environmental and Sustainability Law ===\nThe ''Journal of Environmental and Sustainability Law'', or JESL, formerly known as the ''Missouri Environmental Law & Policy Review'', was a joint venture between the School of Law and the [[Missouri Bar Association]]. Founded in 1993, JESL  consisted of 11 student editors and no more than 20 student associates.\n\nJESL published case notes and articles on topics including energy policy, land use, water policy, agricultural law, land reclamation, and environmental sustainability. From its inception in 1993 to the 2010-2011 school year, it published three editions each year. Beginning in the 2011-2012 school year, two issues per year are published, one each in the fall and spring. The journal's last issue was published in spring 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://law.missouri.edu/jesl/|title=Home Page - Journal of Environmental & Sustainability Law|website=law.missouri.edu|access-date=2018-09-04}}</ref>\n\n== Employment ==\nAccording to Mizzou Law's official 2016 ABA-required disclosures, 82% of the Class of 2016 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.missouri.edu/careers/employment-statistics/ |title=Employment Statistics}}</ref> Mizzou Law's [[Law School Transparency]] under-employment score is 17.7%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2016 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lstreports.com/schools/missouri/ |title=University of Missouri - Columbia Profile}}</ref>\n\n==Costs==\nFor the 2019-2020 school year, in-state tuition is $22,218.95, and out-of-state tuition is $41,079.35.<ref>{{cite http://law.missouri.edu/financialaid/cost/}}</ref>  The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Mizzou Law for the 2014-2015 academic year is $55,106 for non-Missouri residents and $34,476.30 for Missouri residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.missouri.edu/financialaid/cost/ |title=Tuition and Expenses}}</ref> The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $212,935 for non-Missouri residents and $143,714 for Missouri residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lstscorereports.com/schools/missouri/costs/2013/ |title=University of Missouri - Columbia Profile}}</ref>  \n\nIn 2017, the school was recognized and ranked 21st by ''The National Jurist'' and ''preLaw Magazine'' as one of the nation's best valued law schools. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://bluetoad.com/publication/frame.php?i=443086&p=22&pn=&ver=html5|title=The National Jurist Fall 2017 Page 22|access-date=2018-09-04}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Faculty==\n\n*[[Royce de rohan Barondes]] (contracts & business organizations)\n*[[Dennis Crouch|Dennis D.

{"title_page": "Scooter (motorcycle)", "text_new": "{{For|similar terms|Scooter (disambiguation)}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Red scooter rider Avenida Do Mar, Funchal, Madeira Island.jpg|upright=1.14|thumb|The [[Vespa]] was the first globally popular scooter ]]\n\nA '''scooter''' or '''motor scooter''' is a type of [[motorcycle]] with a [[step-through frame]] and a platform for the rider's feet. Elements of scooter design were present in some of the earliest motorcycles, and scooters have been made since at least 1914. Scooter development continued in Europe and the United States [[Interwar period|between the World Wars]].\n\nThe global popularity of motor scooters dates from the post-World War II introductions of the [[Vespa]] and [[Lambretta]] models in Italy. These scooters were intended to provide economical personal transportation ([[engine]]s from {{convert|50|to|250|cc|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The original layout is still widely used in this application. Maxi-scooters, with larger engines from {{convert|250|to|850|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} have been developed for Western markets.\n\nScooters are popular for personal transportation partly due to being more affordable, easier to operate, and more convenient to park and store than a car. Licensing requirements for scooters are easier and cheaper than for cars in most parts of the world, and insurance is usually cheaper. The term motor scooter is sometimes used to avoid confusion with [[kick scooter]], but can then be confused with [[motorized scooter]]s, another distinct kind of scooter.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines a motor scooter is a motorcycle similar to a [[kick scooter]] with a seat, a floorboard, and small or low wheels.<ref name=ScooterDefinition/> The [[United States Department of Transportation|US Department of Transportation]] defines a scooter as a motorcycle that has a platform for the operator's feet or has integrated footrests, and has a step-through architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?section=571.123  |title=DOT Regulation Part 571.123: Standard No. 123; Motorcycle controls and displays. |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration |accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>\n\nThe classic scooter design features a step-through frame and a flat floorboard for the rider's feet.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} This design is possible because most scooter engines and drive systems are attached to the rear axle or under the seat. Unlike a conventional motorcycle, in which the engine is mounted on the frame, most modern scooters allow the engine to swing with the rear wheel, while most vintage scooters and some newer [[retro]] models have an axle-mounted engine. Modern scooters starting from late-1980s generally use a [[continuously variable transmission]] (CVT), while older ones use a manual transmission with the gearshift and clutch control built into the left handlebar.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nScooters usually feature bodywork, including a front leg shield and body that conceals all or most of the mechanicals. There is often some integral storage space, either under the seat, built into the front leg shield, or both. Scooters have varying engine displacements and configurations ranging from 50&nbsp;cc single-cylinder to 850&nbsp;cc twin-cylinder models.\n\nTraditionally, scooter wheels are smaller than conventional motorcycle wheels and are made of pressed steel or cast aluminum alloy, bolt on easily, and often are interchangeable between front and rear. Some scooters carry a [[spare wheel]]. Many recent scooters use conventional [[Motorcycle fork|front forks]] with the front axle fastened at both ends.\n\n== Regulatory classification ==\n\nMost jurisdictions do not differentiate between scooters and motorcycles. For all legal purposes in the United States of America, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) recommends using the term motorcycle for all of these vehicles. However, while NHTSA excludes the term ''motor scooter'' from legal definition, it proceeds, in the same document, to give detailed instructions on how to import a small motor scooter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/import/FAQ%20Site/pages/page3.html#Anchor-52644   |title=Importation and Certification FAQ's Directory-Motorcycles and Scooters |publisher=Nhtsa.dot.gov   |accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref>\n\n===California===\n{{As of|2020}} the US state of California has a highly complex regulatory system for 2- and 3-wheeled vehicles.  It classifies vehicles with fewer than four wheels into the following categories:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myronsmopeds.com/category/california-vehicle-codes/|title=California Vehicle Codes|work=Myron's Mopeds}}</ref>\n* Motorcycle: a motorcycle is any 2- or 3-wheeled gas operated vehicle weighing under 1,500 lbs. with an engine displacement greater than or equal to 150ccs.  Operation requires an M1 class license, and such vehicles must be registered with the state and carry mandatory insurance as well as bear a motorcycle license plate.  Motorcycles may travel on any public roadway, including freeways, and may carry a single passenger in addition to the driver.  Helmets are mandatory.\n* Motor-driven cycle: a motor-driven cycle is 2-wheeled gas operated vehicle with an engine displacement of 149ccs or less that does not qualify as a moped (see below) and is capable of traveling greater than 30mph.  It has the same licensing, registration, insurance, license plating, and helmet requirements as a motorcycle, though it may not travel on freewways.  Such vehicles are commonly referred to as \"scooters\".\n* Moped: a moped (or \"motorized bicycle\") is a 2- or 3-wheeled device with an automatic transmission capable of traveling no more than 30mph, with either a gas engine displacement of less than 50ccs (i.e., 49ccs or less) ''with'' built-in pedals like a bicycle for human operation, OR, if powered only by electricity, it must not produce more than four gross [[brake horsepower]] (bicycle pedals are optional for electric mopeds).  There are no registration or insurance requirements for the device, but the operator him- or herself must have an M1 or M2 class license and must personally carry the minimum state automobile insurance and the moped itself must bear a special moped license plate. A single passenger is permitted if the vehicle is fitted with a specific seat and footrests for same.\n*Motorized tricycle/ quadricycie: a motorized tricycle or quadricycle is a 3- or 4-wheeled vehicle propelled by a gas motor not capable of traveling greater than 30mph and with a gross brake horsepower of 2 or less.\n* Motorized scooter: a motorized scooter is a 2-wheeled vehicle not capable of traveling greater than 15mph with a floorboard designed to be stood upon while operating.  They do not require a license plate or insurance, and may not be driven on a roadway with a posted speed limit greater than 25mph.  A valid class C driver license is required, as is a bicycle helmet.  Passenger are prohibited.  They may be operated on a bikepath or bikeway but not on a sidewalk.  If a given roadway has a bicycle lane, the motorized scooter must travel within it, and can only make a left-hand turn by dismounting and crossing an intersection as a pedestrian.\n* Electric bicycle: California recognizes three classes of electric bicycle.  A class 1 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose electric motor only provides assistance to the rider when using the pedals and stops assisting when the bicycle reaches 20mph; a class 2 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose motor can drive the bicycle entirely on its own, but will not assist the rider above 20mph; a class 3 electric bicycle is identical to a class 1 electric bicycle, but is capable of traveling up 28mph before the engine stops assisting the rider AND is equipped with a speedometer.  No electric bicycle requires insurance, a license, or any form of registration or license plate as it is not considered a \"motor vehicle\" by the state.\n\n== Emissions ==\n{{See also|Fuel gas-powered scooter}}\nThe [[vehicle emissions control|emissions]] of [[moped]]s and scooters have been the subject of multiple studies. Studies have found that [[two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] 50&nbsp;[[Cubic centimetre|cc]] mopeds, with and without catalytic converters, emit ten to thirty times more hydrocarbons and particulate emissions than the outdated [[European emission standards|Euro 3]] automobile standards.<ref name=\"eri.ucr.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eri.ucr.edu/ISAFXVCD/ISAFXVAF/EmMPFAM.pdf|work=Schramm et al.|title=Emissions from a Moped Fuelled by Gasoline/Ethanol Mixtures|accessdate=2010-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=44|issue=1|pages=505\u2013512|title=Chemical characterization of emissions from modern two-stroke mopeds complying with legislative regulation in Europe (EURO-2)|doi=10.1021/es9021969|pmid=19928903|year = 2010|last1 = Adam|first1 = T.|last2=Farfaletti|first2=A.|last3=Montero|first3=L.|last4=Martini|first4=G.|last5=Manfredi|first5=U.|last6=Larsen|first6=B.|last7=Santi|first7=G.

In 1894, [[Hildebrand & Wolfm\u00fcller]] in [[Munich]], Germany produced the first motorcycle that was available for purchase. Their motorcycle had a step-through frame, with its fuel tank mounted on the down tube, its parallel two-cylinder engine mounted low on the frame, and its cylinders mounted in line with the frame. It was water-cooled and had a [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] built into the top of the rear fender. It became the first mass-produced and publicly sold powered two-wheel vehicle, and among the first powered mainly by its engine rather than foot pedals. Maximum speed was {{convert|40|kph|abbr=on}}. The rear wheel was driven directly by rods from the pistons in a manner similar to the drive wheels of [[steam locomotive]]s. Only a few hundred such bikes were built, and the high price and technical difficulties made the venture a financial failure for both Wolfm\u00fcller and his financial backer, Hildebrand.<ref name=\"WoM_HuW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.khulsey.com/motorcycles/vintage_motorcycle_hildebrand_wolfmueller.html|title=The World of Motorcycles: Vintage Motorcycles - Hildebrand & Wolfm\u00fcller|publisher=Kevin Hulsey Illustration, Inc.|website=theworldofmotorcycles.com|accessdate=2009-05-17}}</ref>\n\nIn France, the [[Auto-Fauteuil]] was introduced in 1902.

D'Ascanio's {{convert|98|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} scooter had various new design concepts, including a stress-bearing structure. The [[gear shift]] lever was moved to the handlebars for easier riding. The engine was placed near the rear wheel, eliminating the [[belt drive]]. The typical fork support was replaced by an arm similar to an aircraft carriage for easier tire-changing. The body design protected the driver from wind and road dirt. The smaller wheels and shorter wheelbase provide improved maneuverability through narrow streets and congested traffic. The name originated when Piaggio's president, upon seeing the prototype, remarked ''\"Sembra una vespa\"'', \"It looks like a wasp\".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMonths after the Vespa, in 1947, [[Innocenti]] introduced the [[Lambretta (motorscooter)|Lambretta]], beginning a rivalry with Vespa.

Honda's [[Honda PS250|PS250]] (also known as Big Ruckus) features a motorcycle-like exoskeleton instead of bodywork.\n\nA new direction in maxi-scooters has the engine fixed to the frame. This arrangement improves handling by allowing bigger wheels and less unsprung weight, also tending to move the centre of gravity forwards. The trend toward larger, more powerful scooters with fully automatic transmissions converges with an emerging trend in motorcycle design that foreshadows automatic transmission motorcycles with on-board storage. Examples include the [[Aprilia Mana 850]] automatic-transmission motorcycle and the [[Honda NC700D Integra]], which is a scooter built on a motorcycle platform.\n\n===Enclosed scooter===\n{{Main|Cabin motorcycle}}\n\nSome scooters, including the [[BMW C1]] and the [[Honda Gyro|Honda Gyro Canopy]], have a windscreen and a roof.

Some examples are: the [[ENV]] from Intelligent Energy, [[Honda]]'s scooter using the Honda FC Stack, and the Yamaha FC-AQEL. Also, petroleum hybrid-electric motorcycles are available.

This has a slanted downtube, which defines an underbone, and no foot platform, the presence of which defines a scooter.]]\n\nAn [[underbone]] is a motorcycle built on a chassis consisting mostly of a single large diameter tube. An underbone differs from a conventional motorcycle mainly by not having a structural member connecting the [[head stock]] to the structure under the front of the seat and by not having a fuel tank or similarly styled appendage in the space between the riders knees. Underbones are commonly referred to as \"step-throughs\" and appeal to both genders in much the same way as scooters.\n\nUnderbones are often mistaken for scooters and are sometimes marketed as such. However, an underbone does not have a footboard, and is therefore not a scooter.\n\nThe engine of an underbone is usually fixed to the chassis under the downtube, while a scooter usually has its engine mounted on its [[swingarm]]. As a result, underbone engines are usually further forwards than those of scooters. A typical underbone therefore has a more central [[center of mass|centre of gravity]] than a typical scooter. Furthermore, having an engine mounted on the swingarm gives a typical scooter more [[unsprung mass]] than a typical underbone. These factors give a typical underbone better handling than a typical scooter.\n\nThe engine of an underbone typically drives the rear wheel by a chain of the kind used on a conventional motorcycle. This final drive is often concealed by a chain enclosure to keep the chain clean and reduce wear. The final drive of a scooter with a swingarm-mounted engine runs in a sealed oil bath and is shorter.\n\nAn underbone is usually fitted with near full-size motorcycle wheels, which are often spoked. Scooter wheels are usually small, and made from pressed steel. In both cases, more recent examples often have cast alloy wheels. The bigger wheels of an underbone allow more ventilation and better cooling for the brakes than the smaller wheels of a scooter.\n\nWhile the engine and suspension layouts described here for scooters and underbones are typical, they are not rigid definitions. There have been scooters with fixed engines and chain drive, and there have been underbones with swingarm-mounted engines. A twenty-first century example of variance from the typical scooter layout is the [[Suzuki Choinori]], which had both its engine and its rear axle rigidly bolted to its frame.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Some atypical scooters and underbones\">\nFile:Heinkel Tourist 103 A0, Bj. 1956.jpg|1956 Heinkel Tourist.

In Thailand, scooters are used for street to door taxi services, as well as for navigating through heavy traffic. The extensive range of cycle tracks in the Netherlands extends into parts of Belgium and Germany and is open to all small powered two-wheelers. Motor scooters are popular because of their size, [[fuel efficiency|fuel-efficiency]], weight, and typically larger storage room than a motorcycle.

Scooters had provided inexpensive transportation for decades before the development of the mod subculture, but the mods stood out in the way that they treated the vehicle as a fashion accessory, expressed through clubs such as the [[Ace of Herts]]. Italian scooters were preferred for their cleanlined, curving shapes and gleaming [[chrome plating|chrome]].

Engine side panels and front bumpers were taken to local electroplating workshops and plated with highly reflective chrome.\n\nScooters were also a practical and accessible form of transportation for 1960s teens. In the early 1960s, [[public transport]] stopped relatively early in the night, and so having scooters allowed mods to stay out all night at dance clubs. To keep their expensive suits clean and keep warm while riding, mods often wore long army parkas. For teens with low-end jobs, scooters were cheaper than cars, and they could be bought on a payment plan through newly available [[hire purchase]] plans. After a law was passed requiring at least one mirror be attached to every motorcycle, mods were known to add four, ten, or as many as 30 mirrors to their scooters.

Elements of scooter design were present in some of the earliest motorcycles, and scooters have been made since at least 1914. Scooter development continued in Europe and the United States [[Interwar period|between the World Wars]].\n\nThe global popularity of motor scooters dates from the post-World War II introductions of the [[Vespa]] and [[Lambretta]] models in Italy. These scooters were intended to provide economical personal transportation ([[engine]]s from {{convert|50|to|250|cc|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The original layout is still widely used in this application. Maxi-scooters, with larger engines from {{convert|250|to|850|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} have been developed for Western markets.\n\nScooters are popular for personal transportation partly due to being more affordable, easier to operate, and more convenient to park and store than a car. Licensing requirements for scooters are easier and cheaper than for cars in most parts of the world, and insurance is usually cheaper. The term motor scooter is sometimes used to avoid confusion with [[kick scooter]], but can then be confused with [[motorized scooter]]s, another distinct kind of scooter.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines a motor scooter is a motorcycle similar to a [[kick scooter]] with a seat, a floorboard, and small or low wheels.<ref name=ScooterDefinition/> The [[United States Department of Transportation|US Department of Transportation]] defines a scooter as a motorcycle that has a platform for the operator's feet or has integrated footrests, and has a step-through architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?section=571.123  |title=DOT Regulation Part 571.123: Standard No. 123; Motorcycle controls and displays. |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration |accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>\n\nThe classic scooter design features a step-through frame and a flat floorboard for the rider's feet.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} This design is possible because most scooter engines and drive systems are attached to the rear axle or under the seat. Unlike a conventional motorcycle, in which the engine is mounted on the frame, most modern scooters allow the engine to swing with the rear wheel, while most vintage scooters and some newer [[retro]] models have an axle-mounted engine. Modern scooters starting from late-1980s generally use a [[continuously variable transmission]] (CVT), while older ones use a manual transmission with the gearshift and clutch control built into the left handlebar.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nScooters usually feature bodywork, including a front leg shield and body that conceals all or most of the mechanicals. There is often some integral storage space, either under the seat, built into the front leg shield, or both. Scooters have varying engine displacements and configurations ranging from 50&nbsp;cc single-cylinder to 850&nbsp;cc twin-cylinder models.\n\nTraditionally, scooter wheels are smaller than conventional motorcycle wheels and are made of pressed steel or cast aluminum alloy, bolt on easily, and often are interchangeable between front and rear. Some scooters carry a [[spare wheel]]. Many recent scooters use conventional [[Motorcycle fork|front forks]] with the front axle fastened at both ends.\n\n== Regulatory classification ==\n\nMost jurisdictions do not differentiate between scooters and motorcycles. For all legal purposes in the United States of America, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) recommends using the term motorcycle for all of these vehicles. However, while NHTSA excludes the term ''motor scooter'' from legal definition, it proceeds, in the same document, to give detailed instructions on how to import a small motor scooter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/import/FAQ%20Site/pages/page3.html#Anchor-52644   |title=Importation and Certification FAQ's Directory-Motorcycles and Scooters |publisher=Nhtsa.dot.gov   |accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref>\n\n===California===\n{{As of|2020}} the US state of California has a highly complex regulatory system for 2- and 3-wheeled vehicles.  It classifies vehicles with fewer than four wheels into the following categories:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myronsmopeds.com/category/california-vehicle-codes/|title=California Vehicle Codes|work=Myron's Mopeds}}</ref>\n* Motorcycle: a motorcycle is any 2- or 3-wheeled gas operated vehicle weighing under 1,500 lbs. with an engine displacement greater than or equal to 150ccs.  Operation requires an M1 class license, and such vehicles must be registered with the state and carry mandatory insurance as well as bear a motorcycle license plate.  Motorcycles may travel on any public roadway, including freeways, and may carry a single passenger in addition to the driver.  Helmets are mandatory.\n* Motor-driven cycle: a motor-driven cycle is 2-wheeled gas operated vehicle with an engine displacement of 149ccs or less that does not qualify as a moped (see below) and is capable of traveling greater than 30mph.  It has the same licensing, registration, insurance, license plating, and helmet requirements as a motorcycle, though it may not travel on freewways.  Such vehicles are commonly referred to as \"scooters\".\n* Moped: a moped (or \"motorized bicycle\") is a 2- or 3-wheeled device with an automatic transmission capable of traveling no more than 30mph, with either a gas engine displacement of less than 50ccs (i.e., 49ccs or less) ''with'' built-in pedals like a bicycle for human operation, OR, if powered only by electricity, it must not produce more than four gross [[brake horsepower]] (bicycle pedals are optional for electric mopeds).  There are no registration or insurance requirements for the device, but the operator him- or herself must have an M1 or M2 class license and must personally carry the minimum state automobile insurance and the moped itself must bear a special moped license plate. A single passenger is permitted if the vehicle is fitted with a specific seat and footrests for same.\n*Motorized tricycle/ quadricycie: a motorized tricycle or quadricycle is a 3- or 4-wheeled vehicle propelled by a gas motor not capable of traveling greater than 30mph and with a gross brake horsepower of 2 or less.\n* Motorized scooter: a motorized scooter is a 2-wheeled vehicle not capable of traveling greater than 15mph with a floorboard designed to be stood upon while operating.  They do not require a license plate or insurance, and may not be driven on a roadway with a posted speed limit greater than 25mph.  A valid class C driver license is required, as is a bicycle helmet.  Passenger are prohibited.  They may be operated on a bikepath or bikeway but not on a sidewalk.  If a given roadway has a bicycle lane, the motorized scooter must travel within it, and can only make a left-hand turn by dismounting and crossing an intersection as a pedestrian.\n* Electric bicycle: California recognizes three classes of electric bicycle.  A class 1 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose electric motor only provides assistance to the rider when using the pedals and stops assisting when the bicycle reaches 20mph; a class 2 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose motor can drive the bicycle entirely on its own, but will not assist the rider above 20mph; a class 3 electric bicycle is identical to a class 1 electric bicycle, but is capable of traveling up 28mph before the engine stops assisting the rider AND is equipped with a speedometer.  No electric bicycle requires insurance, a license, or any form of registration or license plate as it is not considered a \"motor vehicle\" by the state.\n\n== Emissions ==\n{{See also|Fuel gas-powered scooter}}\nThe [[vehicle emissions control|emissions]] of [[moped]]s and scooters have been the subject of multiple studies.

Their motorcycle had a step-through frame, with its fuel tank mounted on the down tube, its parallel two-cylinder engine mounted low on the frame, and its cylinders mounted in line with the frame. It was water-cooled and had a [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] built into the top of the rear fender. It became the first mass-produced and publicly sold powered two-wheel vehicle, and among the first powered mainly by its engine rather than foot pedals. Maximum speed was {{convert|40|kph|abbr=on}}. The rear wheel was driven directly by rods from the pistons in a manner similar to the drive wheels of [[steam locomotive]]s.

D'Ascanio's {{convert|98|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} scooter had various new design concepts, including a stress-bearing structure. The [[gear shift]] lever was moved to the handlebars for easier riding. The engine was placed near the rear wheel, eliminating the [[belt drive]]. The typical fork support was replaced by an arm similar to an aircraft carriage for easier tire-changing. The body design protected the driver from wind and road dirt. The smaller wheels and shorter wheelbase provide improved maneuverability through narrow streets and congested traffic. The name originated when Piaggio's president, upon seeing the prototype, remarked ''\"Sembra una vespa\"'', \"It looks like a wasp\".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nMonths after the Vespa, in 1947, [[Innocenti]] introduced the [[Lambretta (motorscooter)|Lambretta]], beginning a rivalry with Vespa.

Honda's [[Honda PS250|PS250]] (also known as Big Ruckus) features a motorcycle-like exoskeleton instead of bodywork.\n\nA new direction in maxi-scooters has the engine fixed to the frame. This arrangement improves handling by allowing bigger wheels and less unsprung weight, also tending to move the centre of gravity forwards. The trend toward larger, more powerful scooters with fully automatic transmissions converges with an emerging trend in motorcycle design that foreshadows automatic transmission motorcycles with on-board storage.

This has a slanted downtube, which defines an underbone, and no foot platform, the presence of which defines a scooter.]]\n\nAn [[underbone]] is a motorcycle built on a chassis consisting mostly of a single large diameter tube. An underbone differs from a conventional motorcycle mainly by not having a structural member connecting the [[head stock]] to the structure under the front of the seat and by not having a fuel tank or similarly styled appendage in the space between the riders knees. Underbones are commonly referred to as \"step-throughs\" and appeal to both genders in much the same way as scooters.\n\nUnderbones are often mistaken for scooters and are sometimes marketed as such. However, an underbone does not have a footboard, and is therefore not a scooter.\n\nThe engine of an underbone is usually fixed to the chassis under the downtube, while a scooter usually has its engine mounted on its [[swingarm]]. As a result, underbone engines are usually further forwards than those of scooters. A typical underbone therefore has a more central [[center of mass|centre of gravity]] than a typical scooter. Furthermore, having an engine mounted on the swingarm gives a typical scooter more [[unsprung mass]] than a typical underbone. These factors give a typical underbone better handling than a typical scooter.\n\nThe engine of an underbone typically drives the rear wheel by a chain of the kind used on a conventional motorcycle. This final drive is often concealed by a chain enclosure to keep the chain clean and reduce wear. The final drive of a scooter with a swingarm-mounted engine runs in a sealed oil bath and is shorter.\n\nAn underbone is usually fitted with near full-size motorcycle wheels, which are often spoked. Scooter wheels are usually small, and made from pressed steel. In both cases, more recent examples often have cast alloy wheels. The bigger wheels of an underbone allow more ventilation and better cooling for the brakes than the smaller wheels of a scooter.\n\nWhile the engine and suspension layouts described here for scooters and underbones are typical, they are not rigid definitions. There have been scooters with fixed engines and chain drive, and there have been underbones with swingarm-mounted engines. A twenty-first century example of variance from the typical scooter layout is the [[Suzuki Choinori]], which had both its engine and its rear axle rigidly bolted to its frame.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Some atypical scooters and underbones\">\nFile:Heinkel Tourist 103 A0, Bj. 1956.jpg|1956 Heinkel Tourist.

In Thailand, scooters are used for street to door taxi services, as well as for navigating through heavy traffic. The extensive range of cycle tracks in the Netherlands extends into parts of Belgium and Germany and is open to all small powered two-wheelers. Motor scooters are popular because of their size, [[fuel efficiency|fuel-efficiency]], weight, and typically larger storage room than a motorcycle.

Scooters had provided inexpensive transportation for decades before the development of the mod subculture, but the mods stood out in the way that they treated the vehicle as a fashion accessory, expressed through clubs such as the [[Ace of Herts]]. Italian scooters were preferred for their cleanlined, curving shapes and gleaming [[chrome plating|chrome]]. For young mods, Italian scooters were the \"embodiment of continental style and a way to escape the working-class row houses of their upbringing\".<ref name=\"straight.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.straight.com/article/vespa-scoots-sexily-back-to-vancouver|title=Vespa Scoots Sexily Back to Vancouver|last=Sarti|first=Doug|date=June 3, 2004|publisher=Vancouver Free Press|location=Vancouver, Canada|quote=The scooter, to them, was the embodiment of continental style and a way to escape the working-class row houses of their upbringing.|work=straight.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522112423/http://www.straight.com/article/vespa-scoots-sexily-back-to-vancouver|archivedate=2011-05-22|url-status=live|accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref> They customized their scooters by painting them in \"two-tone and candyflake and overaccessorized [them] with luggage racks, crash bars, and scores of mirrors and fog lights\",<ref name=\"straight.com\"/> and they often put their names on the small windscreen. Engine side panels and front bumpers were taken to local electroplating workshops and plated with highly reflective chrome.\n\nScooters were also a practical and accessible form of transportation for 1960s teens. In the early 1960s, [[public transport]] stopped relatively early in the night, and so having scooters allowed mods to stay out all night at dance clubs. To keep their expensive suits clean and keep warm while riding, mods often wore long army parkas. For teens with low-end jobs, scooters were cheaper than cars, and they could be bought on a payment plan through newly available [[hire purchase]] plans. After a law was passed requiring at least one mirror be attached to every motorcycle, mods were known to add four, ten, or as many as 30 mirrors to their scooters. The cover of [[The Who]]'s album ''[[Quadrophenia]]'', which includes themes related to mods and [[Rocker (subculture)|rockers]], depicts a young man on a Vespa GS with four mirrors attached.<ref>{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=Pete|title=Quadrophenia|year=1973|publisher=Fabulous Music Ltd., 1973|location=London|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7r3PSgAACAAJ&dq=quadrophenia}}</ref> The album spawned a [[Quadrophenia (film)|1979 motion picture of the same name]].\n\n[[Scooterboy]] magazines include the British monthly magazine ''[[Scootering (British magazine)|Scootering]]''<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gillard|first1=Andy|first2=Gareth |last2=Brown |author3=Stuart Lanning |title=Scootering |journal=Scootering |year=1986 |url=http://www.mortonsmediagroup.com/media/sco.asp#ratecardia}}</ref> \nand the American quarterly magazine ''Scoot!''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Whitney |first1=April |first2=Josh |last2=Rogers |first3=Mike |last3=Zorn |first4=Casey |last4=Earls |first5=Barry |last5=Synoground |journal=Scoot! |year=1995|url=http://www.scootmagazine.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517035608/http://www.scootmagazine.com/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-05-17 |title= Scoot!}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Auto rickshaw]]\n* [[Cutdown]]\n* [[List of scooter manufacturers]]\n* [[List of scooters]]\n* [[Fuel gas-powered scooter#Conversion kits for petrol scooters|Fuel conversion kits for scooters]]\n* [[Mobility scooter]]\n* [[Segway PT]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{-}}\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=ScooterDefinition>Various scooter definitions:\n* {{cite book |title= The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary |edition= third |year= 1968 |origyear= 1956 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford, UK |pages= 1808\u201309|quote='''3.'''

The scales in this species are keeled; scales found on top of the head have been noted to be  larger than those located on the back. Water monitors are often defined by their dark brown or blackish coloration with yellow spots found on their underside- these yellow markings have a tendency to disappear gradually with age. This species is also denoted by the blackish band with yellow edges extending back from each eye. These monitors have very long necks and an elongated snout. They use their powerful jaws, serrated teeth and sharp claws for both predation and defense. In captivity, Asian water monitors' life expectancy has been determined to be anywhere between 11\u201325 years depending on conditions, in the wild it is considerably shorter.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://wildlife-facts.weebly.com/asian-water-monitor.html|title=Asian Water Monitor|website=Wildlife Facts|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vitalexotics.com/water-monitor-black-dragon-care-sheet/|title=Water Monitor Care Sheet {{!}} Black Dragon Care Sheet {{!}} Varanus salvator Care Sheet {{!}} Vital Exotics|website=www.vitalexotics.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202203120/http://www.vitalexotics.com/water-monitor-black-dragon-care-sheet/|archive-date=2017-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:Water monitor showing split tongue .jpg|thumb|showing its split tongue]]\nThe Asian water monitor is widely distributed from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, the Chinese [[Guangxi]] and [[Hainan]] provinces, Malaysia, Singapore to the [[Sunda islands]] [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], [[Bali]], [[Borneo]] and [[Sulawesi]].

It has been noted that these monitors are not deterred from living in areas of human disturbance. In fact, they have been known to adapt and thrive in agricultural areas as well as cities with canal systems (such as in Sri Lanka, where they are not hunted or persecuted by humans). This species does not thrive in habitats with extensive loss of natural vegetation and aquatic resources. Habitats that are considered to be most important to this species are mangrove vegetation, swamps, wetlands, and altitudes below 1000 meters.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Behaviour and ecology ==\n[[File:Varanus salvator (illustration).jpg|thumb|Water monitors robbing eggs from a nest.

He is not afraid of people, but will lie gaping and hissing at them in the way, and will scarce stir out of it. He will come and eat Carrion with the Dogs and Jackals, and will not be scared away by them, but if they come near to bark or snap at him, with his tail, which is long like a whip, he will so slash them, that they will run away and howl.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |author=Knox, R. |title=An Historical Relation of the Island of Ceylon in the East Indies: Together With, an Account of the Detaining in Captivity the Author, and Divers, Other Englishmen Now Living There, and of the Author's Miraculous Escape |location=London |year=1681 |publisher=Richard Chiswell}}</ref>\n\nWater monitors should be handled with care since they have many sharp teeth and can give gashing bites that can sever tendons and veins, causing extensive bleeding.

Previously, venom was thought to be unique to [[Serpentes]] (snakes) and ''[[Heloderma]]'' (venomous lizards). The aftereffects of a ''Varanus'' bite were thought to be due to oral [[bacteria]] alone, but recent studies have shown [[venom]] glands are likely to be present in the mouths of several, if not all, of the species. The venom may be used as a defensive mechanism to fend off predators, to help digest food, to sustain oral hygiene, and possibly to help in capturing and killing prey.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Arbuckle, K. |url=http://www.varanidae.org/Vol3_No2_Arbuckle.pdf |title=Ecological Function of Venom in ''Varanus'', with a Compilation of Dietary Records from the Literature|journal=Biowak |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=46\u221256 |year=2009}}</ref><ref>Yong, Ed.

Water monitors are often defined by their dark brown or blackish coloration with yellow spots found on their underside- these yellow markings have a tendency to disappear gradually with age. This species is also denoted by the blackish band with yellow edges extending back from each eye. These monitors have very long necks and an elongated snout. They use their powerful jaws, serrated teeth and sharp claws for both predation and defense. In captivity, Asian water monitors' life expectancy has been determined to be anywhere between 11\u201325 years depending on conditions, in the wild it is considerably shorter.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://wildlife-facts.weebly.com/asian-water-monitor.html|title=Asian Water Monitor|website=Wildlife Facts|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vitalexotics.com/water-monitor-black-dragon-care-sheet/|title=Water Monitor Care Sheet {{!}} Black Dragon Care Sheet {{!}} Varanus salvator Care Sheet {{!}} Vital Exotics|website=www.vitalexotics.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202203120/http://www.vitalexotics.com/water-monitor-black-dragon-care-sheet/|archive-date=2017-12-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:Water Monitor Sunderban National Park West Bengal India 22.08.2014.jpg|thumb|Asian water monitor showing split tongue ([[Sunderbans National Park]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]])]]\nThe Asian water monitor is widely distributed from India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, the Chinese [[Guangxi]] and [[Hainan]] provinces, Malaysia, Singapore to the [[Sunda islands]] [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], [[Bali]], [[Borneo]] and [[Sulawesi]].

He will come and eat Carrion with the Dogs and Jackals, and will not be scared away by them, but if they come near to bark or snap at him, with his tail, which is long like a whip, he will so slash them, that they will run away and howl.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |author=Knox, R. |title=An Historical Relation of the Island of Ceylon in the East Indies: Together With, an Account of the Detaining in Captivity the Author, and Divers, Other Englishmen Now Living There, and of the Author's Miraculous Escape |location=London |year=1681 |publisher=Richard Chiswell}}</ref>\n\nWater monitors should be handled with care since they have many sharp teeth and can give gashing bites that can sever tendons and veins, causing extensive bleeding.

Previously, venom was thought to be unique to [[Serpentes]] (snakes) and ''[[Heloderma]]'' (venomous lizards). The aftereffects of a ''Varanus'' bite were thought to be due to oral [[bacteria]] alone, but recent studies have shown [[venom]] glands are likely to be present in the mouths of several, if not all, of the species. The venom may be used as a defensive mechanism to fend off predators, to help digest food, to sustain oral hygiene, and possibly to help in capturing and killing prey.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Arbuckle, K. |url=http://www.varanidae.org/Vol3_No2_Arbuckle.pdf |title=Ecological Function of Venom in ''Varanus'', with a Compilation of Dietary Records from the Literature|journal=Biowak |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=46\u221256 |year=2009}}</ref><ref>Yong, Ed.
