It is the 140th entry in the series released by [[Columbia Pictures]] starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959.\n\n==Plot==\nLarry is a womanizer who is having an affair with Moe's wife, Belle ([[Mary Ainslee]]) while making eyes at Shemp's fianc\u00e9e, Millie ([[Angela Stevens]]), as well. Moe, however, tracks down the conniving Larry at his pet shop, and gives him the works. Larry is able to think fast and convinces Moe he is innocent, which calms him down. Realizing he needs to cover his tracks, Larry looks for a \"fall guy\" in the form of Shemp. Larry then gets Shemp a job as an underwear salesman and the first place he goes is Moe's home.\n\nWhile Shemp is modeling his ware for Belle, Larry calls both Millie and Moe and lies to them about Shemp's advances on Moe's wife. Both of them go storming over to Moe's, with Moe carrying a loaded gun. Looking to avoid being killed, Shemp flees up the chimney. After he fools Moe with a [[Santa Claus]] disguise, Shemp makes a quick getaway. Shemp then spies Larry coming. Now aware that Larry set him up, Shemp knocks Larry out and dresses him in the Santa outfit and sends him to Moe, Millie, and Moe's wife. Moe unmasks Larry to the surprise of them all and chases him out of the apartment. Moe shoots Larry in the buttocks times before accidentally shooting himself in the foot while celebrating.\n\n==Production notes==\n''He Cooked His Goose'' was [[remake|reworked]] in 1959 as ''[[Triple Crossed]]'', using ample [[stock footage]] from the original. It is one of only three films in which [[Larry Fine]] is the main character.

It is the 140th entry in the series released by [[Columbia Pictures]] starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959.\n\n==Plot==\nLarry is a womanizer who is having an affair with Moe's wife, Belle ([[Mary Ainslee]]) while making eyes at Shemp's fianc\u00e9e, Millie ([[Angela Stevens]]), as well. Moe, however, tracks down the conniving Larry at his pet shop, and gives him the works. Larry is able to think fast and convinces Moe he is innocent, which calms him down. Realizing he needs to cover his tracks, Larry looks for a \"fall guy\" in the form of Shemp. Larry then gets Shemp a job as an underwear salesman and the first place he goes is Moe's home.\n\nWhile Shemp is modeling his ware for Belle, Larry calls both Millie and Moe and lies to them about Shemp's advances on Moe's wife. Both of them go storming over to Moe's, with Moe carrying a loaded gun. Looking to avoid being killed, Shemp flees up the chimney. After he fools Moe with a [[Santa Claus]] disguise, Shemp makes a quick getaway. Shemp then spies Larry coming. Now aware that Larry set him up, Shemp knocks Larry out and dresses him in the Santa outfit and sends him to Moe, Millie, and Moe's wife. Moe unmasks Larry to the surprise of them all and chases him out of the apartment. Moe shoots Larry in the buttocks times before accidentally shooting himself in the foot while celebrating.\n\n==Production notes==\n''He Cooked His Goose'' was [[remake|reworked]] in 1959 as ''[[Triple Crossed]]'', using ample [[stock footage]] from the original. It is one of only three films in which [[Larry Fine]] is the main character. The other two where he takes the lead role are ''[[Woman Haters]]'' and ''[[Three Loan Wolves]]''.<ref name=\"Solomon\"/>\n\n''He Cooked His Goose'' was filmed on January 7-9, 1952 when Christmas trees were available, but not released until July.

Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship.\" The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted.

The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Indira by the early 1980s the Soviets became the largest trading partner of India.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

The political parties in India paid substantial attention to Gandhi's gender before she became prime minister, hoping to use her for political gain.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/23/archives/indira-gandhi-has-never-regretted-being-a-woman-well-almost-never.html</ref><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/14/archives/indira-gandhi-is-either-hated-or-adored-indira-gandhi-is-either.html</ref> \nEven though men surrounded Gandhi during her upbringing, she still had a female role model as a child. Several books on Gandhi mention her interest in [[Joan of Arc]]. In her own accounts through her letters, she wrote to her friend Dorothy Norman, in 1952 she wrote: \"At about eight or nine I was taken to France; Jeanne d'Arc became a great heroine of mine. She was one of the first people I read about with enthusiasm.\"<ref>Norman, Dorothy. Indira Gandhi, Letters to an American Friend. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985. Print. 12.</ref> Another historian recounts Indira's comparison of herself to Joan of Arc: \"Indira developed a fascination for Joan of Arc, telling her aunt, 'Someday I am going to lead my people to freedom just as Joan of Arc did!{{' \"}}<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print. 107.</ref> Gandhi's linking of herself to Joan of Arc presents a nice model for historians to assess Gandhi. As one writer said: \"The Indian people were her children; members of her family were the only people capable of leading them.\"<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print. 131.</ref>\n\nGandhi had been swept up in the call for Indian independence since she was born in 1917.<ref>\"Indira Gandhi.\" About Indira Gandhi. Web. 20 November 2012.\n<http://www.indiragandhi.com/aboutindiragandhi.htm>.</ref> Thus by 1947, she was already well immersed in politics, and by 1966, when she first assumed the position of prime minister, she had held several cabinet positions in her father's office.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2017}}\n\nGandhi's advocacy for women's rights began with her help in establishing the Congress Party's Women's Section.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2017}} In 1956, she wrote in a letter: \"It is because of this that I am taking a much more active part in politics. I have to do a great deal of touring in order to set up the Congress Party Women's Section, and am on numerous important committees.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Gandhi spent a great deal of time throughout the 1950s helping organize women. She wrote to Norman in 1959, irritable that women had organized around the communist cause but had not mobilized for the Indian cause: \"The women, whom I have been trying to organize for years, had always refused to come into politics. Now they are out in the field.\"<ref>Norman, Dorothy. Indira Gandhi, Letters to an American Friend. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985. Print. 57.</ref> Once appointed president in 1959, she \"travelled relentlessly, visiting remote parts of the country that had never before received a VIP...she talked to women, asked about child health and welfare, inquired after the crafts of the region\"<ref>Jayakar, Pupul. Indira Gandhi: An Intimate Biography. New York: Pantheon, 1992. Print. 112.</ref> Gandhi's actions throughout her ascent to power clearly reflect a desire to mobilize women{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2017}}. Gandhi did not see the purpose of feminism. Gandhi saw her own success as a woman, and also noted that \"Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once.\"<ref name=\"Norman, Dorothy 1985\"/>\n\nGandhi felt guilty about her inability to fully devote her time to her children. She noted that her main problem in office was how to balance her political duties with tending to her children, and \"stressed that motherhood was the most important part of her life.\"<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print. 127.</ref> At another point, she went into more detail: \"To a woman, motherhood is the highest fulfilment...To bring a new being into this world, to see its perfection and to dream of its future greatness is the most moving of all experiences and fills one with wonder and exaltation.\"<ref>Malhotra, Inder. Indira Gandhi: A Personal and Political Biography. Boston: Northeastern UP, 1989. Print. 55.</ref>\n\nHer domestic initiatives did not necessarily reflect favourably on Indian women. Gandhi did not make a special effort to appoint women to cabinet positions. She did not appoint any women to full cabinet rank during her terms in office.<ref name=\"Genovese, Michael A. 1993\"/> Yet despite this, many women saw Gandhi as a symbol for feminism and an image of women's power.<ref name=\"Genovese, Michael A. 1993\"/>\n\n==Legacy== \n\nAfter leading India to victory against Pakistan in the [[Bangladesh liberation war]] in 1971, President [[V.

However, Gandhi rejected calls to resign and announced plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. Gandhi insisted that the conviction did not undermine her position, despite having been unseated from Lok Sabha. She said: \"There is a lot of talk about our government not being clean, but from our experience the situation was very much worse when [opposition] parties were forming governments\". And she dismissed criticism of the way her Congress Party raised election campaign money, saying all parties used the same methods. The prime minister retained the support of her party, which issued a statement backing her.\n\nAfter news of the verdict spread, hundreds of supporters demonstrated outside her house, pledging their loyalty.

Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship.\" The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]].

Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods.

She noted that her main problem in office was how to balance her political duties with tending to her children, and \"stressed that motherhood was the most important part of her life.\"<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993.

{"title_page": "Criminal justice system of Japan", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=January 2007}}\n{{POV | date = May 2019}}\n\nThree basic features of [[Japan]]'s system of [[criminal justice]] characterize its operations. First, the institutions\u2014[[Law enforcement in Japan|police]], government prosecutors' offices, [[Judicial system of Japan|courts]], and [[Penal system of Japan|correctional organs]]\u2014maintain close and cooperative relations with each other, consulting frequently on how best to accomplish the shared goals of limiting and controlling [[crime in Japan|crime]]. Second, citizens are encouraged to assist in maintaining public order, and they participate extensively in [[crime prevention]] campaigns, apprehension of suspects, and offender [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] programs. Finally, officials who administer criminal justice are allowed considerable discretion in dealing with offenders.\n\nIn 2020, Japan ranked 9th in the sub-ranking \"criminal justice\" in the [[World Justice Project|World Justice Project's]] Rule of Law Index, second highest among [[Group of Seven|G7]] countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldjusticeproject.org/rule-of-law-index/global/2020/Criminal%20Justice/|title=WJP Rule of Law Index|last=|first=|date=|website=worldjusticeproject.org|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nUntil the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, the Japanese criminal justice system was controlled mainly by ''[[daimy\u014d]]s''. Public officials, not laws, guided and constrained people to conform to moral norms. In accordance with the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ideal, officials were to serve as models of behavior; the people, who lacked rights and had only obligations, were expected to obey. Such laws as did exist were transmitted through local military officials in the form of local domain laws. Specific enforcement varied from domain to domain, and no formal [[criminal code|penal codes]] existed. Justice was generally harsh, and severity depended upon one's status. Kin and neighbors could share blame for an offender's guilt: whole families and villages could be flogged or put to death for one member's transgression. (see [[Criminal punishment in Edo-period Japan]] for details)\n\nAfter 1868 the justice system underwent rapid transformation. The first publicly promulgated legal codes, the [[Penal Code of 1880]] and the [[Code of Criminal Instruction of 1880]], were based on French models, i.e. the [[Napoleonic code]]. Offenses were specified, and set punishments were established for particular crimes. Both codes were innovative in that they treated all citizens as equals, provided for centralized administration of criminal justice, and prohibited punishment by [[ex post facto law]]. Guilt was held to be personal; [[collective guilt]] and [[guilt by association]] were abolished. Offenses against the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] were spelled out for the first time.\n\nInnovative aspects of the codes notwithstanding, certain provisions reflected traditional attitudes toward authority. The prosecutor represented the state and sat with the judge on a raised platform\u2014his position above the defendant and the defense counsel suggesting their relative status. Under a semi-inquisitorial system, primary responsibility for questioning witnesses lay with the judge, and defense counsel could question witnesses only through the judge. Cases were referred to trial only after a judge presided over a preliminary fact-finding investigation in which the suspect was not permitted counsel. Because in all trials available evidence had already convinced the court in a preliminary procedure, the defendant's legal [[presumption of innocence]] at trial was undermined, and the [[legal recourse]] open to his counsel was further weakened.\n\nThe [[Criminal Code of Japan|Penal Code]] was substantially revised in 1907 to reflect the growing influence of German law in Japan, and the French practice of classifying offenses into three types was eliminated. More important, where the old code had allowed very limited judicial discretion, the new one permitted the judge to apply a wide range of subjective factors in [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]].\n\nAfter World War II, [[Occupation of Japan|occupation]] authorities initiated reform of the constitution and laws in general. Except for omitting offenses relating to war, the imperial family, and adultery, the 1947 Penal Code remained virtually identical to the 1907 version. The [[criminal procedure]] code, however, was substantially revised to incorporate rules guaranteeing the rights of the accused. The system became almost completely accusatorial, and the judge, although still able to question witnesses, decided a case on evidence presented by both sides. The preliminary investigative procedure was suppressed. The prosecutor and defense counsel sat on equal levels, below the judge. Laws on indemnification of the wrongly accused and laws concerning juveniles, prisons, probation, and minor offenses were also passed in the postwar years to supplement criminal justice administration.\n\n== Criminal investigation ==\nIn the [[Empire of Japan]], the [[criminal investigation]] was presided over by [[prosecutor]]s, like the [[Minist\u00e8re public (France)|Minist\u00e8re public]] does in French law. Then, with the 1947 [[:ja:\u8b66\u5bdf\u6cd5|Police Law]] and 1948 [[:ja:\u5211\u4e8b\u8a34\u8a1f\u6cd5|Code of Criminal Procedure]], responsibility of investigations has been defined as uniquely resting with police officers. In order to fulfill this responsibility, [[Prefectural police department#Criminal investigation|criminal investigation department]]s were set up in each [[prefectural police department]]. After the establishment of the 1954 amended Police Law, these departments are supervised by the [[National Police Agency (Japan)#Criminal Affairs Bureau|Criminal Affairs Bureau of the National Police Agency]].<ref name=\"NPA1977\">{{Cite book|editor=National Police Agency Police History Compilation Committee|year=1977|title=Japan post-war police history|publisher=[[:ja:\u8b66\u5bdf\u5354\u4f1a|Japan Police Support Association]]|language=Japanese|page=320}}</ref>\n\n== Criminal procedure ==\nThe nation's criminal justice officials follow specified legal procedures in dealing with offenders. Once a suspect is arrested by police officers, the case is turned over to attorneys in the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office, who are the government's sole agents in prosecuting lawbreakers. Under the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]]'s administration, these officials work under [[Supreme Court of Japan|Supreme Court]] rules and are career [[Civil service of Japan|civil servants]] who can be removed from office only for incompetence or impropriety. Prosecutors presented the government's case before judges in the Supreme Court and the four types of lower courts: high courts, district courts, summary courts, and family courts. Penal and probation officials administer programs for convicted offenders under the direction of public prosecutors (see [[Judicial System of Japan]]).\n\nAfter identifying a suspect, police have the authority to exercise some discretion in determining the next step. If, in cases pertaining to theft, the amount is small or already returned, the offense petty, the victim unwilling to press charges, the act accidental, or the likelihood of a repetition not great, the police can either drop the case or turn it over to a prosecutor. Reflecting the belief that appropriate remedies are sometimes best found outside the formal criminal justice mechanisms, in 1990 over 70 percent of criminal cases were not sent to the prosecutor.\n\n==Juveniles==\nPolice also exercise wide discretion in matters concerning [[juvenile (law)|juvenile]]s. Police are instructed by law to identify and counsel minors who appear likely to commit crimes, and they can refer juvenile offenders and non-offenders alike to child guidance centers to be treated on an outpatient basis. Police can also assign juveniles or those considered to be harming the welfare of juveniles to special family courts. These courts were established in 1949 in the belief that the adjustment of a family's situation is sometimes required to protect children and prevent [[juvenile delinquency]]. Family courts are run in closed sessions, try juvenile offenders under special laws, and operate extensive probationary guidance programs. The cases of young people between the ages of fourteen and twenty can, at the judgment of police, be sent to the public prosecutor for possible trial as adults before a judge under the general criminal law.\n\n==Citizens==\n\n===Arrest===\nPolice have to secure [[Warrant (law)|warrants]] to search for or seize evidence. A warrant is also necessary for an arrest, although if the crime is very serious or if the perpetrator is likely to flee, it can be obtained immediately after arrest. Within forty-eight hours after placing a suspect under detention, the police have to present their case before a prosecutor, who is then required to apprise the accused of the charges and of the right to counsel. Within another twenty-four hours, the prosecutor has to go before a judge and present a case to obtain a detention order. Suspects can be held for ten days (extensions are granted in almost all cases when requested){{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=March 2013}}, pending an investigation and a decision whether or not to prosecute. In the 1980s, some suspects were reported to have been mistreated during this detention to exact a confession.  These detentions often occur at cells within police stations, called ''[[daiyo kangoku]]''. A suspect can be taken into custody after arrest and before prosecution for up to 23 days.\n\n===Prosecution===\nProsecution can be denied on the grounds of insufficient evidence or on the prosecutor's judgment. Under Article 248 of the [[Code of Criminal Procedure]], after weighing the offender's age, character, and environment, the circumstances and gravity of the crime, and the accused's rehabilitative potential, public action does not have to be instituted, but can be denied or suspended and ultimately dropped after a probationary period. Because the investigation and disposition of a case can occur behind closed doors and the identity of an accused person who is not prosecuted is rarely made public, an offender can successfully reenter society and be rehabilitated under probationary status without the stigma of a criminal conviction.\n\n===Inquest of prosecution===\nInstitutional safeguards check the prosecutors' discretionary powers not to prosecute. Lay committees are established in conjunction with branch courts to hold inquests on a prosecutor's decisions. These committees meet four times yearly and can order that a case be reinvestigated and prosecuted. Victims or interested parties can also appeal a decision not to prosecute.\n\n===Trial===\nMost offenses are tried first in district courts before one or three judges, depending on the severity of the case. Defendants are protected from [[self-incrimination]], [[forced confession]], and unrestricted admission of hearsay evidence. In addition, defendants have the right to counsel, [[public trial]], and cross-examination. [[Jury trial|Trial by jury]] was authorized by the 1923 Jury Law but was suspended in 1943. A [[Lay judges in Japan|new lay judge law]] was enacted in 2004 and came into effect in May 2009, but it only applies to certain serious crimes.\n\nThe judge conducts the trial and is authorized to question witnesses, independently call for evidence, decide guilt, and pass sentence. The judge can also suspend any sentence or place a convicted party on [[probation]]. Should a judgment of not guilty be rendered, the accused is entitled to compensation by the state based on the number of days spent in detention.\n\nCriminal cases from summary courts, family courts, and district courts can be appealed to the high courts by both the prosecution and the defense. Criminal appeal to the Supreme Court is limited to constitutional questions and a conflict of precedent between the Supreme Court and high courts.\n\nThe criminal code sets minimum and maximum sentences for offenses to allow for the varying circumstances of each crime and criminal. Penalties range from fines and short-term incarceration to compulsory labor and the death penalty. Heavier penalties are meted out to repeat offenders. [[Capital punishment in Japan|Capital punishment]] consists of death by hanging and is usually imposed for multiple homicides.\n\nAfter a sentence is finalized, the only recourse for a convict to gain an acquittal is through a [[retrial]].  A retrial can be granted if the convicted person or their legal representative show [[reasonable doubt]] about the finalized verdict, such as clear evidence that past testimony or expert opinions in the trial were false.<ref>Ito, Masami, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110816i1.html Retrials high hurdle but sole tack for wrongfully convicted]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 16 August 2011, p. 3.</ref> On average, it takes 3 months to get a final judgment for a first trial.\n\n====Trial by lay judge====\n{{Main article|Lay judges in Japan}}\nThe first trial by citizen judge, {{nihongo|''saiban-in''|\u88c1\u5224\u54e1||lay judge}}, began August 3, 2009 under a new law passed in 2004.  Six citizens became lay judges and joined three professional judges to determine the verdict and sentence the defendant. Japan belongs to an inquisitory system of criminal process. Therefore, a judge oversees the proceedings and also determines the guilt and the sentence of the accused. The citizen lay judges as well as professional judges are allowed to put forth questions to defendants, witnesses and victims during the trial.  The new system aims to invite participation of the wider community and also provide a speedier, more democratic justice system, according to [[Eisuke Sato]], the justice minister.  The first trial by lay judge lasted four days, while some comparable criminal cases may last years under the old system.  The historic trial of 72-year-old Katsuyoshi Fujii, who stabbed his 66-year-old neighbor to death, had substantial media attention. The selected lay judges must be voters, at least 20 years old, and possess a secondary-level education.  Professional lawyers and politicians may not serve as lay judges in the new system.  At least one judge must concur with the majority vote from the lay judges in regards to a guilty verdict; however, a majority not-guilty verdict by the lay judges will stand.  During the inaugural case, the citizens relied on the professional judges to help ascertain a sentence for the verdict decided upon, but felt confident in their interpretation of the trial arguments presented by the prosecution and defense.<ref name=\"Tabuchi\">{{Citation\n  | last = Tabuchi\n  | first = Hiroko\n  | last2 = McDonald\n  | first2 = Mark\n  | title = In First Return to Japan Court, Jurors Convict and Sentence\n  | newspaper =[[The New York Times]]\n  | date =  August 6, 2009\n  | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/world/asia/07japan.html?_r=1&partner=MOREOVERNEWS&ei=5040\n|accessdate=2009-08-06\n  | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC\">{{Citation\n  | title = Japan's landmark jury trial ends\n  | newspaper =BBC News\n  | date =  August 6, 2009\n  | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8188447.stm\n|accessdate=2009-08-06\n  | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref><ref name=\"Wallacy\">{{Citation\n  | last = Wallacy\n  | first = Mark\n  | title = Japan revives jury trials\n  | newspaper =ABC News\n  | date =  August 6, 2009\n  | url =http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/08/05/2646469.htm\n|accessdate=2009-08-06\n  | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n  | author = [https://www.theguardian.com/profile/justinmccurry Justin McCurry]\n  | title = Trial by jury returns to Japan Thousands queue to witness historic change to country's criminal justice system\n  | newspaper = Guardian.co.uk\n  | date = August 3, 2009\n  | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/03/japan-trial-by-jury-returns\n|accessdate=2009-08-06\n  | postscript = <!--none-->}}\n</ref>\n\n==Conviction rate==\n{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=August 2011}}\n{{Original research section|date=December 2015}}\nOne of the main features of the Japanese criminal justice system well known in the rest of the world is its extremely high [[conviction rate]], which exceeds 99%.<ref>{{Cite web\n    | url = http://hakusyo1.moj.go.jp/en/61/image/image/h002003001001h.jpg\n    | title = Number of persons finally judged by type of judgment (1969, 1979, 1989, 1999, 2002-2011)\n    | publisher = [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)]]\n    | accessdate=2014-03-12\n}}</ref> Some in the common law countries argue that this is to do with elimination of the [[jury system]] in 1943, however, trials by jury were rarely held as the accused had to give up the right to appeal. Lobbying by human rights groups and the Japan Federation of Bar Associations resulted in the passing of a judicial reform bill in May, 2004, which introduced a lay-judge system in 2009, which is often confused with jury system in common law countries.<ref>[http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/japan/index.do Japan Human Rights Concerns] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202190101/http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/japan/index.do |date=2007-02-02 }}, Amnesty International</ref>\n\nJ. Mark Ramseyer of [[Harvard Law School]] and Eric B. Rasmusen of [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] examine if the accusation is in fact warranted. In their paper (\"Why Is the Japanese Conviction Rate So High?\") they examined two possibilities. One is that judges who come under the control of central bureaucracy are pressured to pass a guilty verdict, ensuring high conviction. Another possibility is that, given that the non-jury system under inquisition system has predictable ruling on guilt, Japan's understaffed prosecutors working on low budgets only bring the most obviously guilty defendants to trial, and do not file indictments in cases in which they are not certain they can win.<ref>Ramseyer & Rasmusen, [http://www.rasmusen.org/published/Rasmusen-01.JLS.jpncon.pdf \"Why Is the Japanese Conviction Rate So High?\"]</ref> \n\nThe most likely reason why the Japanese conviction rate is so high is that prosecutors have a broad discretion to prosecute or not, taking into account many factors (similar to sentencing factors in Western countries). The prosecutors may decide, for example, not to prosecute someone even if there is sufficient evidence to win at trial, because of the circumstances of the crime or accused. Article 248 of the Japanese Code of Criminal Procedure states: \"Where prosecution is deemed unnecessary owing to the character, age, environment, gravity of the offense, circumstances or situation after the offense, prosecution need not be instituted.\" Thus, prosecutors in Japan have a very broad discretion in the decision to prosecute or not.\n\nAll Japanese court rulings are accessible in digital format; the two academics examined every case after [[World War II]] in which the court found the defendant not guilty. The result is mixed. Simple statistical analysis shows that the judge's later career tends to be negatively affected by a non-guilty verdict. However, by examining the individual cases, the two academics found that all of those cases which negatively affected judges' careers had political implications (such as labour law or electoral law) and that the facts of the case (i.e. the defendants committing the accused deed) itself were never in dispute. However, judges delivered 'not guilty' verdicts on technicalities such as statutes of limitation or constitutional arguments, which were subsequently reversed in a higher court. In cases in which the judge delivered a 'not guilty' verdict because they ruled that there was insufficient evidence to ascertain that the defendants did the accused deed, the judge suffered no negative consequence. For this reason, the paper argued that Japanese judges are politically conservative in legal interpretation but are not biased in matter of fact.\n\nIn the matter relating to Japanese prosecutors being extremely cautious, the paper found ample evidence for it. In Japan, 99.7% of all the cases brought to court resulted in conviction, while in the U.S. the figure is 88%. According to a cited research, in the U.S. the accused contest guilt in 22% of federal cases and 11% of state cases, while in Japan, the ratio is modestly less. The paper attributes this difference to greater predictability of the outcome in Japanese cases. This is due to two reasons. One is that it is the judge rather than the jury who determines the verdict. As judges \"have seen it all before\" and the lawyers on both sides \"have seen them seeing it\", as they can read the judge's previous ruling (which includes written reasoning for the previous verdict), the way that the judge thinks and argues is very predictable.\n\nSecondly, Japanese trials before the institution of the current lay judge system, were discontinuous. The defense and the prosecutor would first gather in front of the judges and present the issue. Then, the court would enter recess and both sides would go back to prepare their case. As they reconvened on different dates, they would then present each case which the judges examined, the court would be put in recess again and each side would go back to gather further evidence. Some complex trials took years or even a decade to conclude which is impossible under jury system. During the questioning of evidence, judges were explicit about their opinions by the way they questioned the evidence, which gave greater predictability about the final verdict.\n\nFor this reason, the prosecutor is far more likely to bring in the case where conviction is assured and the accused is far more likely to settle.\n\nMoreover, the paper found that Japanese prosecutors have a far more pressing need to be selective. In the U.S., the federal government employs 27,985 lawyers and the states employ another 38,242 (of which 24,700 are state prosecutors). In Japan, with about a third of U.S. population, the entire government employs a mere 2,000. Despite Japan having a low crime rate, such numbers create a significant case overload for prosecutors. In the U.S., there are 480 arrests (96 serious cases) per year per state prosecutor. (The actual figure is lower as some are prosecuted in federal court). In Japan, the figure is 700 per year per prosecutor. In the U.S., a rough estimate is that 42% of arrests in felony cases result in prosecution - while in Japan, the figure is only 17.5%.\n\nIn murder, U.S. police arrested 19,000 people for 26,000 murders, in which 75% were prosecuted and courts convicted 12,000 people. In Japan, 1,800 people were arrested for 1,300 murders, but prosecutors tried only 43%. Had the allegation that Japanese prosecutors use weak evidence mostly based on (forced) confessions to achieve convictions been true, the larger proportion of arrests would have resulted in prosecutions and eventual conviction. But the opposite is true. In fact, the data indicates that Japanese prosecutors bring charges only when the evidence is overwhelming and likelihood of conviction is near absolute, which gives a greater incentive for the accused to confess and aim for a lighter sentence, which, in turn, results in a high rate for confession.\n\nThe Japanese criminal justice system, despite retaining the death penalty, is relatively lenient in sentencing by the standard of the United States. Outside capital cases, many of those sentenced to life sentences are paroled within 15 years. Those convicted of less heinous murder and manslaughter are likely to serve less than 10 years. Those convicted of rape will often serve less than two to five years. It is even possible for someone convicted of murder to serve a suspended sentence if the defense successfully argues for mitigating circumstances. Moreover, in Japanese criminal proceedings the conviction and sentencing phase are separate. In the Japanese criminal justice system, these are distinct phases, echoing that of common law jurisdictions where sentencing is usually remitted to a later hearing after a finding of guilt. The court proceedings first determine guilt, then a second proceeding takes place to determine the sentence. Prosecutors and defense teams argue each phase. Defense lawyers, given the predictability of the outcome in term of guilt once the charge is brought, together with leniency of punishment (except in death penalty cases), often advise the accused to confess their guilt in trial. Remorse is seen as a mitigating factor which tends to bring reduced sentences.\n\n==Confession in Japanese criminal investigation==\nMany Western human rights organizations alleged that the high conviction rate is due to rampant use of conviction solely based on [[Confession (law)|confession]]. Confessions are often obtained after long periods of questioning by police as those arrested may be held for up to 23 days. This can at times take weeks, during which the suspect is in detention and can be prevented from contacting a lawyer or family.<ref name=\"BBCmp3\">BBC. \"Assignment - Rough Justice in Japan\". Sept. 13, 2007 (http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/docarchive/docarchive_20070913-1539.mp3)</ref>\n\nArticle 38 of Japan's Constitution categorically requires that \"no person shall be convicted or punished in cases where the only proof against a suspect is his/her own confession,\" In practice, this constitutional requirement takes a form of safeguarding known as the \"revelation of secret\" (Himitsu no Bakuro, lit. \"outing of secret\"). Because suspects are put through continuous interrogation that could last up to 23 days, as well as isolation from the outside world - including access to lawyers, both the Japanese judiciary, and the public - it can be suggested that the court is well aware that confession of guilt can easily be forced. Consequently, the court (and the public) take the view that mere confession of guilt alone is never any sufficient ground for conviction.\n\nInstead, for confession to be a valid evidence for conviction, the Japanese court requires confession to include revelation of verifiable factual matter that only the perpetrator of the crime could have known about, such as the location of an undiscovered body or the time and place the murder weapon was purchased, a fact about the crime scene, etc. Furthermore, to safeguard against the possibility that the interrogator has implanted such knowledge into the confession, the prosecutor must prove that such revelation of secret was unknown to the police until the point of confession. For example, in the 1948 Sachiura murder case, the conviction was initially secured by the confession of the location of the body, which was yet to be discovered. However, it later transpired that the police had likely known the location of the body, and this created a possibility that the confession of this information could've been forged and implanted by the investigating police. This resulted in the higher court declaring the confession unsafe and reversing the verdict.\n\nActivists claim that the Japanese justice system (and the Japanese public to some extent) consider that prolonged interrogation of a suspect in isolation without access to lawyers is justified to solve criminal cases without risking a miscarriage of justice. In addition, the requirement that the revelation of relevant information by the accused must be unknown to the police, and that the prosecutor must examine the police investigation before the case is brought to the court, is seen as an extra layer of safeguarding for the validity of confession as evidence.\n\nHowever, most miscarriage of justice cases in Japan are, indeed, the result of conviction solely based on the confession of the accused. In these case, (1) the record of sequence and timing of the police discoveries of evidence and the timing of confession is unclear (or even faked by the police) (2) the contents of the revelation of secret has only weak relevance to the crime itself or that (3) the revelation of secret is actually only so vague that it can only be loosely applied to the elements of the crime ([[Prosecutor's fallacy]]). Serious miscarriage of justice cases in Japan involve police deliberately faking the police evidence (and insufficient supervision by the prosecutor to spot such rogue behaviour) such as where the police already knew (or suspected) the location of the body or the murder weapon but they fake the police record to make it appear that it is the suspect who revealed the location. During the 1970s, a series of reversals to death penalty cases brought attention to the fact that some accused, after intensive interrogation, had signed \"as-yet unwritten confessions\", which were later actually filled in by investigating police officers. Moreover, in some cases, the police falsified the record so that it appeared that the accused confessed to the location of where the body was buried, yet the truth was that the police had written the location into the confession after the body was discovered by other means. These coerced confessions, together with other circumstantial evidence, often convinced judges to (falsely) convict.\n\nCurrently the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations is calling for the entire interrogation phase to be recorded to prevent similar incidents occurring.<ref name=\"Bar\">[http://www.ibanet.org/images/downloads/HRIJapanIntroOfElectronicRecording.pdf \"Interrogation of Criminal Suspects in Japan\"]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, International Bar Association, December 2003</ref> The International Bar Association, which encompasses the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations, cited problems in its \"Interrogation of Criminal Suspects in Japan\".<ref name=\"Bar\" /> Former Japanese [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Minister of Justice]], [[Hideo Hiraoka]], has also supported videotaping interrogations.<ref name=JT>{{cite web|last=Matsutani|first=Minoru|title=Hiraoka urges 'active' debate on executions|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110920f1.html|work=The Japan Times Online|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|accessdate=21 September 2011}}</ref> Police and prosecutors have traditionally been opposed to videotaping interrogations, stating that it would undermine their ability to get confessions.<ref name=JT/> The current office of prosecutors has, however, reversed their previous opposition to this proposal. Proponents argue that without the credibility of confessions supported by electronic recordings, the lay judges may refuse to convict in a case when other offered evidence is weak. It is also argued that recording of interrogation may allow for standards to be lowered in the \"revelation of secret\" where the confession must contain an element of the crime that police and prosecutor did not know about. Once the recording is introduced, it would become impossible for the police to forge a confession. Then, it may become possible to bring conviction based on a confession of elements of the crime that only the perpetrator and the police knew.\n\nIn October 2007, the [[BBC]] published a feature giving examples and an overview of \"'Forced confessions' in Japan\".<ref>BBC Hogg [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7063316.stm 'Forced confessions' in Japan.

First, the institutions\u2014[[Law enforcement in Japan|police]], government prosecutors' offices, [[Judicial system of Japan|courts]], and [[Penal system of Japan|correctional organs]]\u2014maintain close and cooperative relations with each other, consulting frequently on how best to accomplish the shared goals of limiting and controlling [[crime in Japan|crime]]. Second, citizens are encouraged to assist in maintaining public order, and they participate extensively in [[crime prevention]] campaigns, apprehension of suspects, and offender [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] programs. Finally, officials who administer criminal justice are allowed considerable discretion in dealing with offenders.\n\nIn 2020, Japan ranked 9th in the sub-ranking \"criminal justice\" in the [[World Justice Project|World Justice Project's]] Rule of Law Index, second highest among [[Group of Seven|G7]] countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldjusticeproject.org/rule-of-law-index/global/2020/Criminal%20Justice/|title=WJP Rule of Law Index|last=|first=|date=|website=worldjusticeproject.org|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nUntil the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, the Japanese criminal justice system was controlled mainly by ''[[daimy\u014d]]s''. Public officials, not laws, guided and constrained people to conform to moral norms. In accordance with the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ideal, officials were to serve as models of behavior; the people, who lacked rights and had only obligations, were expected to obey. Such laws as did exist were transmitted through local military officials in the form of local domain laws. Specific enforcement varied from domain to domain, and no formal [[criminal code|penal codes]] existed. Justice was generally harsh, and severity depended upon one's status. Kin and neighbors could share blame for an offender's guilt: whole families and villages could be flogged or put to death for one member's transgression. (see [[Criminal punishment in Edo-period Japan]] for details)\n\nAfter 1868 the justice system underwent rapid transformation. The first publicly promulgated legal codes, the [[Penal Code of 1880]] and the [[Code of Criminal Instruction of 1880]], were based on French models, i.e. the [[Napoleonic code]]. Offenses were specified, and set punishments were established for particular crimes. Both codes were innovative in that they treated all citizens as equals, provided for centralized administration of criminal justice, and prohibited punishment by [[ex post facto law]]. Guilt was held to be personal; [[collective guilt]] and [[guilt by association]] were abolished. Offenses against the [[Emperor of Japan|emperor]] were spelled out for the first time.\n\nInnovative aspects of the codes notwithstanding, certain provisions reflected traditional attitudes toward authority. The prosecutor represented the state and sat with the judge on a raised platform\u2014his position above the defendant and the defense counsel suggesting their relative status. Under a semi-inquisitorial system, primary responsibility for questioning witnesses lay with the judge, and defense counsel could question witnesses only through the judge. Cases were referred to trial only after a judge presided over a preliminary fact-finding investigation in which the suspect was not permitted counsel. Because in all trials available evidence had already convinced the court in a preliminary procedure, the defendant's legal [[presumption of innocence]] at trial was undermined, and the [[legal recourse]] open to his counsel was further weakened.\n\nThe [[Criminal Code of Japan|Penal Code]] was substantially revised in 1907 to reflect the growing influence of German law in Japan, and the French practice of classifying offenses into three types was eliminated. More important, where the old code had allowed very limited judicial discretion, the new one permitted the judge to apply a wide range of subjective factors in [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]].\n\nAfter World War II, [[Occupation of Japan|occupation]] authorities initiated reform of the constitution and laws in general. Except for omitting offenses relating to war, the imperial family, and adultery, the 1947 Penal Code remained virtually identical to the 1907 version. The [[criminal procedure]] code, however, was substantially revised to incorporate rules guaranteeing the rights of the accused. The system became almost completely accusatorial, and the judge, although still able to question witnesses, decided a case on evidence presented by both sides. The preliminary investigative procedure was suppressed. The prosecutor and defense counsel sat on equal levels, below the judge. Laws on indemnification of the wrongly accused and laws concerning juveniles, prisons, probation, and minor offenses were also passed in the postwar years to supplement criminal justice administration.\n\n== Criminal investigation ==\nIn the [[Empire of Japan]], the [[criminal investigation]] was presided over by [[prosecutor]]s, like the [[Minist\u00e8re public (France)|Minist\u00e8re public]] does in French law. Then, with the 1947 [[:ja:\u8b66\u5bdf\u6cd5|Police Law]] and 1948 [[:ja:\u5211\u4e8b\u8a34\u8a1f\u6cd5|Code of Criminal Procedure]], responsibility of investigations has been defined as uniquely resting with police officers. In order to fulfill this responsibility, [[Prefectural_police_department#Criminal_investigation|Criminal Investigation Department]]s were set up in each [[Prefectural Police Department]]s. After the establishment of the 1954 amended Police Law, these departments are supervised by the [[National Police Agency (Japan)#Criminal Affairs Bureau|Criminal Affairs Bureau of the National Police Agency]].<ref name=\"NPA1977\">{{Cite book|editor=National Police Agency Police History Compilation Committee|year=1977|title=Japan post-war police history|publisher=[[:ja:\u8b66\u5bdf\u5354\u4f1a|Japan Police Support Association]]|language=Japanese|page=320}}</ref>\n\n== Criminal procedure ==\nThe nation's criminal justice officials follow specified legal procedures in dealing with offenders. Once a suspect is arrested by police officers, the case is turned over to attorneys in the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office, who are the government's sole agents in prosecuting lawbreakers. Under the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]]'s administration, these officials work under [[Supreme Court of Japan|Supreme Court]] rules and are career [[Civil service of Japan|civil servants]] who can be removed from office only for incompetence or impropriety. Prosecutors presented the government's case before judges in the Supreme Court and the four types of lower courts: high courts, district courts, summary courts, and family courts. Penal and probation officials administer programs for convicted offenders under the direction of public prosecutors (see [[Judicial System of Japan]]).\n\nAfter identifying a suspect, police have the authority to exercise some discretion in determining the next step. If, in cases pertaining to theft, the amount is small or already returned, the offense petty, the victim unwilling to press charges, the act accidental, or the likelihood of a repetition not great, the police can either drop the case or turn it over to a prosecutor. Reflecting the belief that appropriate remedies are sometimes best found outside the formal criminal justice mechanisms, in 1990 over 70 percent of criminal cases were not sent to the prosecutor.\n\n==Juveniles==\nPolice also exercise wide discretion in matters concerning [[juvenile (law)|juvenile]]s. Police are instructed by law to identify and counsel minors who appear likely to commit crimes, and they can refer juvenile offenders and non-offenders alike to child guidance centers to be treated on an outpatient basis. Police can also assign juveniles or those considered to be harming the welfare of juveniles to special family courts. These courts were established in 1949 in the belief that the adjustment of a family's situation is sometimes required to protect children and prevent [[juvenile delinquency]]. Family courts are run in closed sessions, try juvenile offenders under special laws, and operate extensive probationary guidance programs. The cases of young people between the ages of fourteen and twenty can, at the judgment of police, be sent to the public prosecutor for possible trial as adults before a judge under the general criminal law.\n\n==Citizens==\n\n===Arrest===\nPolice have to secure [[Warrant (law)|warrants]] to search for or seize evidence. A warrant is also necessary for an arrest, although if the crime is very serious or if the perpetrator is likely to flee, it can be obtained immediately after arrest. Within forty-eight hours after placing a suspect under detention, the police have to present their case before a prosecutor, who is then required to apprise the accused of the charges and of the right to counsel. Within another twenty-four hours, the prosecutor has to go before a judge and present a case to obtain a detention order. Suspects can be held for ten days (extensions are granted in almost all cases when requested){{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=March 2013}}, pending an investigation and a decision whether or not to prosecute. In the 1980s, some suspects were reported to have been mistreated during this detention to exact a confession.  These detentions often occur at cells within police stations, called ''[[daiyo kangoku]]''. A suspect can be taken into custody after arrest and before prosecution for up to 23 days.\n\n===Prosecution===\nProsecution can be denied on the grounds of insufficient evidence or on the prosecutor's judgment. Under Article 248 of the [[Code of Criminal Procedure]], after weighing the offender's age, character, and environment, the circumstances and gravity of the crime, and the accused's rehabilitative potential, public action does not have to be instituted, but can be denied or suspended and ultimately dropped after a probationary period. Because the investigation and disposition of a case can occur behind closed doors and the identity of an accused person who is not prosecuted is rarely made public, an offender can successfully reenter society and be rehabilitated under probationary status without the stigma of a criminal conviction.\n\n===Inquest of prosecution===\nInstitutional safeguards check the prosecutors' discretionary powers not to prosecute. Lay committees are established in conjunction with branch courts to hold inquests on a prosecutor's decisions. These committees meet four times yearly and can order that a case be reinvestigated and prosecuted. Victims or interested parties can also appeal a decision not to prosecute.\n\n===Trial===\nMost offenses are tried first in district courts before one or three judges, depending on the severity of the case. Defendants are protected from [[self-incrimination]], [[forced confession]], and unrestricted admission of hearsay evidence. In addition, defendants have the right to counsel, [[public trial]], and cross-examination. [[Jury trial|Trial by jury]] was authorized by the 1923 Jury Law but was suspended in 1943. A [[Lay judges in Japan|new lay judge law]] was enacted in 2004 and came into effect in May 2009, but it only applies to certain serious crimes.\n\nThe judge conducts the trial and is authorized to question witnesses, independently call for evidence, decide guilt, and pass sentence. The judge can also suspend any sentence or place a convicted party on [[probation]]. Should a judgment of not guilty be rendered, the accused is entitled to compensation by the state based on the number of days spent in detention.\n\nCriminal cases from summary courts, family courts, and district courts can be appealed to the high courts by both the prosecution and the defense. Criminal appeal to the Supreme Court is limited to constitutional questions and a conflict of precedent between the Supreme Court and high courts.\n\nThe criminal code sets minimum and maximum sentences for offenses to allow for the varying circumstances of each crime and criminal. Penalties range from fines and short-term incarceration to compulsory labor and the death penalty. Heavier penalties are meted out to repeat offenders. [[Capital punishment in Japan|Capital punishment]] consists of death by hanging and is usually imposed for multiple homicides.\n\nAfter a sentence is finalized, the only recourse for a convict to gain an acquittal is through a [[retrial]].  A retrial can be granted if the convicted person or their legal representative show [[reasonable doubt]] about the finalized verdict, such as clear evidence that past testimony or expert opinions in the trial were false.<ref>Ito, Masami, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110816i1.html Retrials high hurdle but sole tack for wrongfully convicted]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 16 August 2011, p. 3.</ref> On average, it takes 3 months to get a final judgment for a first trial.\n\n====Trial by lay judge====\n{{Main article|Lay judges in Japan}}\nThe first trial by citizen judge, {{nihongo|''saiban-in''|\u88c1\u5224\u54e1||lay judge}}, began August 3, 2009 under a new law passed in 2004.  Six citizens became lay judges and joined three professional judges to determine the verdict and sentence the defendant. Japan belongs to an inquisitory system of criminal process. Therefore, a judge oversees the proceedings and also determines the guilt and the sentence of the accused. The citizen lay judges as well as professional judges are allowed to put forth questions to defendants, witnesses and victims during the trial.  The new system aims to invite participation of the wider community and also provide a speedier, more democratic justice system, according to [[Eisuke Sato]], the justice minister.  The first trial by lay judge lasted four days, while some comparable criminal cases may last years under the old system.  The historic trial of 72-year-old Katsuyoshi Fujii, who stabbed his 66-year-old neighbor to death, had substantial media attention. The selected lay judges must be voters, at least 20 years old, and possess a secondary-level education.  Professional lawyers and politicians may not serve as lay judges in the new system.  At least one judge must concur with the majority vote from the lay judges in regards to a guilty verdict; however, a majority not-guilty verdict by the lay judges will stand.  During the inaugural case, the citizens relied on the professional judges to help ascertain a sentence for the verdict decided upon, but felt confident in their interpretation of the trial arguments presented by the prosecution and defense.<ref name=\"Tabuchi\">{{Citation\n  | last = Tabuchi\n  | first = Hiroko\n  | last2 = McDonald\n  | first2 = Mark\n  | title = In First Return to Japan Court, Jurors Convict and Sentence\n  | newspaper =[[The New York Times]]\n  | date =  August 6, 2009\n  | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/world/asia/07japan.html?_r=1&partner=MOREOVERNEWS&ei=5040\n|accessdate=2009-08-06\n  | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC\">{{Citation\n  | title = Japan's landmark jury trial ends\n  | newspaper =BBC News\n  | date =  August 6, 2009\n  | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8188447.stm\n|accessdate=2009-08-06\n  | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref><ref name=\"Wallacy\">{{Citation\n  | last = Wallacy\n  | first = Mark\n  | title = Japan revives jury trials\n  | newspaper =ABC News\n  | date =  August 6, 2009\n  | url =http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/08/05/2646469.htm\n|accessdate=2009-08-06\n  | postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n  | author = [https://www.theguardian.com/profile/justinmccurry Justin McCurry]\n  | title = Trial by jury returns to Japan Thousands queue to witness historic change to country's criminal justice system\n  | newspaper = Guardian.co.uk\n  | date = August 3, 2009\n  | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/03/japan-trial-by-jury-returns\n|accessdate=2009-08-06\n  | postscript = <!--none-->}}\n</ref>\n\n==Conviction rate==\n{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=August 2011}}\n{{Original research section|date=December 2015}}\nOne of the main features of the Japanese criminal justice system well known in the rest of the world is its extremely high [[conviction rate]], which exceeds 99%.<ref>{{Cite web\n    | url = http://hakusyo1.moj.go.jp/en/61/image/image/h002003001001h.jpg\n    | title = Number of persons finally judged by type of judgment (1969, 1979, 1989, 1999, 2002-2011)\n    | publisher = [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)]]\n    | accessdate=2014-03-12\n}}</ref> Some in the common law countries argue that this is to do with elimination of the [[jury system]] in 1943, however, trials by jury were rarely held as the accused had to give up the right to appeal.

Mark Ramseyer of [[Harvard Law School]] and Eric B. Rasmusen of [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] examine if the accusation is in fact warranted. In their paper (\"Why Is the Japanese Conviction Rate So High?\") they examined two possibilities. One is that judges who come under the control of central bureaucracy are pressured to pass a guilty verdict, ensuring high conviction. Another possibility is that, given that the non-jury system under inquisition system has predictable ruling on guilt, Japan's understaffed prosecutors working on low budgets only bring the most obviously guilty defendants to trial, and do not file indictments in cases in which they are not certain they can win.<ref>Ramseyer & Rasmusen, [http://www.rasmusen.org/published/Rasmusen-01.JLS.jpncon.pdf \"Why Is the Japanese Conviction Rate So High?\"]</ref> \n\nThe most likely reason why the Japanese conviction rate is so high is that prosecutors have a broad discretion to prosecute or not, taking into account many factors (similar to sentencing factors in Western countries). The prosecutors may decide, for example, not to prosecute someone even if there is sufficient evidence to win at trial, because of the circumstances of the crime or accused. Article 248 of the Japanese Code of Criminal Procedure states: \"Where prosecution is deemed unnecessary owing to the character, age, environment, gravity of the offense, circumstances or situation after the offense, prosecution need not be instituted.\" Thus, prosecutors in Japan have a very broad discretion in the decision to prosecute or not.\n\nAll Japanese court rulings are accessible in digital format; the two academics examined every case after [[World War II]] in which the court found the defendant not guilty. The result is mixed. Simple statistical analysis shows that the judge's later career tends to be negatively affected by a non-guilty verdict. However, by examining the individual cases, the two academics found that all of those cases which negatively affected judges' careers had political implications (such as labour law or electoral law) and that the facts of the case (i.e. the defendants committing the accused deed) itself were never in dispute. However, judges delivered 'not guilty' verdicts on technicalities such as statutes of limitation or constitutional arguments, which were subsequently reversed in a higher court. In cases in which the judge delivered a 'not guilty' verdict because they ruled that there was insufficient evidence to ascertain that the defendants did the accused deed, the judge suffered no negative consequence. For this reason, the paper argued that Japanese judges are politically conservative in legal interpretation but are not biased in matter of fact.\n\nIn the matter relating to Japanese prosecutors being extremely cautious, the paper found ample evidence for it. In Japan, 99.7% of all the cases brought to court resulted in conviction, while in the U.S. the figure is 88%. According to a cited research, in the U.S. the accused contest guilt in 22% of federal cases and 11% of state cases, while in Japan, the ratio is modestly less. The paper attributes this difference to greater predictability of the outcome in Japanese cases. This is due to two reasons. One is that it is the judge rather than the jury who determines the verdict. As judges \"have seen it all before\" and the lawyers on both sides \"have seen them seeing it\", as they can read the judge's previous ruling (which includes written reasoning for the previous verdict), the way that the judge thinks and argues is very predictable.\n\nSecondly, Japanese trials before the institution of the current lay judge system, were discontinuous. The defense and the prosecutor would first gather in front of the judges and present the issue. Then, the court would enter recess and both sides would go back to prepare their case. As they reconvened on different dates, they would then present each case which the judges examined, the court would be put in recess again and each side would go back to gather further evidence. Some complex trials took years or even a decade to conclude which is impossible under jury system. During the questioning of evidence, judges were explicit about their opinions by the way they questioned the evidence, which gave greater predictability about the final verdict.\n\nFor this reason, the prosecutor is far more likely to bring in the case where conviction is assured and the accused is far more likely to settle.\n\nMoreover, the paper found that Japanese prosecutors have a far more pressing need to be selective. In the U.S., the federal government employs 27,985 lawyers and the states employ another 38,242 (of which 24,700 are state prosecutors). In Japan, with about a third of U.S. population, the entire government employs a mere 2,000. Despite Japan having a low crime rate, such numbers create a significant case overload for prosecutors. In the U.S., there are 480 arrests (96 serious cases) per year per state prosecutor. (The actual figure is lower as some are prosecuted in federal court). In Japan, the figure is 700 per year per prosecutor. In the U.S., a rough estimate is that 42% of arrests in felony cases result in prosecution - while in Japan, the figure is only 17.5%.\n\nIn murder, U.S. police arrested 19,000 people for 26,000 murders, in which 75% were prosecuted and courts convicted 12,000 people. In Japan, 1,800 people were arrested for 1,300 murders, but prosecutors tried only 43%. Had the allegation that Japanese prosecutors use weak evidence mostly based on (forced) confessions to achieve convictions been true, the larger proportion of arrests would have resulted in prosecutions and eventual conviction. But the opposite is true. In fact, the data indicates that Japanese prosecutors bring charges only when the evidence is overwhelming and likelihood of conviction is near absolute, which gives a greater incentive for the accused to confess and aim for a lighter sentence, which, in turn, results in a high rate for confession.\n\nThe Japanese criminal justice system, despite retaining the death penalty, is relatively lenient in sentencing by the standard of the United States. Outside capital cases, many of those sentenced to life sentences are paroled within 15 years. Those convicted of less heinous murder and manslaughter are likely to serve less than 10 years. Those convicted of rape will often serve less than two to five years. It is even possible for someone convicted of murder to serve a suspended sentence if the defense successfully argues for mitigating circumstances. Moreover, in Japanese criminal proceedings the conviction and sentencing phase are separate. In the Japanese criminal justice system, these are distinct phases, echoing that of common law jurisdictions where sentencing is usually remitted to a later hearing after a finding of guilt. The court proceedings first determine guilt, then a second proceeding takes place to determine the sentence. Prosecutors and defense teams argue each phase. Defense lawyers, given the predictability of the outcome in term of guilt once the charge is brought, together with leniency of punishment (except in death penalty cases), often advise the accused to confess their guilt in trial. Remorse is seen as a mitigating factor which tends to bring reduced sentences.\n\n==Confession in Japanese criminal investigation==\nMany Western human rights organizations alleged that the high conviction rate is due to rampant use of conviction solely based on [[Confession (law)|confession]]. Confessions are often obtained after long periods of questioning by police as those arrested may be held for up to 23 days. This can at times take weeks, during which the suspect is in detention and can be prevented from contacting a lawyer or family.<ref name=\"BBCmp3\">BBC. \"Assignment - Rough Justice in Japan\". Sept. 13, 2007 (http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/docarchive/docarchive_20070913-1539.mp3)</ref>\n\nArticle 38 of Japan's Constitution categorically requires that \"no person shall be convicted or punished in cases where the only proof against a suspect is his/her own confession,\" In practice, this constitutional requirement takes a form of safeguarding known as the \"revelation of secret\" (Himitsu no Bakuro, lit. \"outing of secret\"). Because suspects are put through continuous interrogation that could last up to 23 days, as well as isolation from the outside world - including access to lawyers, both the Japanese judiciary, and the public - it can be suggested that the court is well aware that confession of guilt can easily be forced. Consequently, the court (and the public) take the view that mere confession of guilt alone is never any sufficient ground for conviction.\n\nInstead, for confession to be a valid evidence for conviction, the Japanese court requires confession to include revelation of verifiable factual matter that only the perpetrator of the crime could have known about, such as the location of an undiscovered body or the time and place the murder weapon was purchased, a fact about the crime scene, etc. Furthermore, to safeguard against the possibility that the interrogator has implanted such knowledge into the confession, the prosecutor must prove that such revelation of secret was unknown to the police until the point of confession. For example, in the 1948 Sachiura murder case, the conviction was initially secured by the confession of the location of the body, which was yet to be discovered. However, it later transpired that the police had likely known the location of the body, and this created a possibility that the confession of this information could've been forged and implanted by the investigating police. This resulted in the higher court declaring the confession unsafe and reversing the verdict.\n\nActivists claim that the Japanese justice system (and the Japanese public to some extent) consider that prolonged interrogation of a suspect in isolation without access to lawyers is justified to solve criminal cases without risking a miscarriage of justice. In addition, the requirement that the revelation of relevant information by the accused must be unknown to the police, and that the prosecutor must examine the police investigation before the case is brought to the court, is seen as an extra layer of safeguarding for the validity of confession as evidence.\n\nHowever, most miscarriage of justice cases in Japan are, indeed, the result of conviction solely based on the confession of the accused. In these case, (1) the record of sequence and timing of the police discoveries of evidence and the timing of confession is unclear (or even faked by the police) (2) the contents of the revelation of secret has only weak relevance to the crime itself or that (3) the revelation of secret is actually only so vague that it can only be loosely applied to the elements of the crime ([[Prosecutor's fallacy]]). Serious miscarriage of justice cases in Japan involve police deliberately faking the police evidence (and insufficient supervision by the prosecutor to spot such rogue behaviour) such as where the police already knew (or suspected) the location of the body or the murder weapon but they fake the police record to make it appear that it is the suspect who revealed the location. During the 1970s, a series of reversals to death penalty cases brought attention to the fact that some accused, after intensive interrogation, had signed \"as-yet unwritten confessions\", which were later actually filled in by investigating police officers. Moreover, in some cases, the police falsified the record so that it appeared that the accused confessed to the location of where the body was buried, yet the truth was that the police had written the location into the confession after the body was discovered by other means. These coerced confessions, together with other circumstantial evidence, often convinced judges to (falsely) convict.\n\nCurrently the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations is calling for the entire interrogation phase to be recorded to prevent similar incidents occurring.<ref name=\"Bar\">[http://www.ibanet.org/images/downloads/HRIJapanIntroOfElectronicRecording.pdf \"Interrogation of Criminal Suspects in Japan\"]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, International Bar Association, December 2003</ref> The International Bar Association, which encompasses the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations, cited problems in its \"Interrogation of Criminal Suspects in Japan\".<ref name=\"Bar\" /> Former Japanese [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Minister of Justice]], [[Hideo Hiraoka]], has also supported videotaping interrogations.<ref name=JT>{{cite web|last=Matsutani|first=Minoru|title=Hiraoka urges 'active' debate on executions|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110920f1.html|work=The Japan Times Online|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|accessdate=21 September 2011}}</ref> Police and prosecutors have traditionally been opposed to videotaping interrogations, stating that it would undermine their ability to get confessions.<ref name=JT/> The current office of prosecutors has, however, reversed their previous opposition to this proposal. Proponents argue that without the credibility of confessions supported by electronic recordings, the lay judges may refuse to convict in a case when other offered evidence is weak. It is also argued that recording of interrogation may allow for standards to be lowered in the \"revelation of secret\" where the confession must contain an element of the crime that police and prosecutor did not know about. Once the recording is introduced, it would become impossible for the police to forge a confession. Then, it may become possible to bring conviction based on a confession of elements of the crime that only the perpetrator and the police knew.\n\nIn October 2007, the [[BBC]] published a feature giving examples and an overview of \"'Forced confessions' in Japan\".<ref>BBC Hogg [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7063316.stm 'Forced confessions' in Japan.

Aviation historians consider the name \"Capronissimo\" to be totally unjustified from a historical point of view.<ref>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|pp=15, 17}}</ref><ref name=alegi_35 />}} It featured eight engines and three sets of triple wings.\n\nOnly one example of this aircraft, designed by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] [[aviation pioneer]] [[Gianni Caproni]], was built by the [[Caproni]] company. It was tested on [[Lake Maggiore]] in 1921: its brief maiden flight took place on February 12 or March 2.{{refn|group=N|name=maiden}} Its second flight was March 4; shortly after takeoff, the aircraft crashed on the water surface and broke up upon impact. The Ca.60 was further damaged when the wreck was towed to shore and, in spite of Caproni's intention to rebuild the aircraft, the project was soon abandoned because of its excessive cost.  The few surviving parts are on display at the [[Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics]] and at the [[Volandia]] [[aviation museum]] in Italy.\n\n== Development ==\n[[Giovanni Battista Caproni|Gianni Caproni]] became a famous aircraft designer and manufacturer during the [[First World War]]; his [[Caproni]] aviation company had major success, especially in the field of heavy multi-engine [[bomber]]s, building aircraft such as the [[Caproni Ca.32]], [[Caproni Ca.33|Ca.33]], [[Caproni Ca.36|Ca.36]] and [[Caproni Ca.40|Ca.40]]. The end of the conflict, however, caused a dramatic decrease in the demand for bombers in the Italian military.  As a result, Caproni, like many other entrepreneurs of the time, directed his attention to the civil aviation market.<ref name=alegi_15>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|p=15}}</ref>\n\nAs early as 1913 Caproni, then aged 27, had said during an interview for the Italian sports newspaper ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' that \"aircraft with a capacity of one hundred and more passengers\" would soon become a reality.<ref name=sfidadelvolo>{{Cite sign |title=La sfida del volo |trans-title=The Challenge of Flight |date=2011 |type=exhibition explanatory panel |publisher=[[Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics]] |location=[[Trento]] |language=it}}</ref> It was after the war, however, that (besides converting some of his large wartime bombers into [[airliner]]s) Caproni began designing a huge and ambitious passenger [[flying boat]]; he first took out a patent on a design of this kind on February 6, 1919.<ref name=alegi_15-17>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|pp=15\u201317}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of a large multi-engined flying boat designed for carrying passengers on long-range flights was considered, at the time, rather eccentric.<ref name=alegi_16>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|p=16}}</ref> Caproni thought, however, that such an aircraft could allow the travel to remote areas more quickly than ground or water transport, and that investing in innovative aerial means would be a less expensive strategy than improving traditional thoroughfares.<ref name=alegi_15/> He affirmed that his large flying boat could be used on any route, within a nation or internationally, and he considered operating it in countries with large territories and poor transport infrastructures, such as [[China]].{{refn|group=N|Caproni wrote: \"There are countries such as China, with immense distances and very backward means of transportation and communications: such countries will turn to the means [of transportation] that offers the greatest progress.\"<ref name=alegi_16/>}}<ref name=alegi_15-16>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|pp=15\u201316}}</ref>\n\nCaproni believed that, to attain these objectives, rearranging wartime aircraft would not be sufficient. On the contrary, he thought that a new generation of airliners (featuring extended range and increased payload capacity, the latter in turn allowing a reduction in cost per passenger) had to supersede the converted leftovers from the war.{{refn|group=N|Caproni also stated that: \"Taking into consideration two centers such as New York and Buenos Aires, it will be seen that, with today's communications, a letter takes about one month to go from New York to Buenos Aires, and another month for the return trip. [...] With an aircraft such as the triple-wing Caproni seaplane the New York\u2013Buenos Aires trip could be made in 3 or 4 days! Today a telegram, again between New York and Buenos Aires, takes one day; the cost is 53 cents or a dollar per word. What would happen if, at about the same cost, it were possible, in three, four days, to deliver to Buenos Aires not a telegram of a few words but a letter, a signed document, valuables, drawing, samples?\"<ref name=alegi_16/>}}\n\nIn spite of criticism from some important figures in Italian aviation, especially aerial warfare theorist [[Giulio Douhet]],<ref name=alegi_16/> Caproni started designing a very innovative aircraft and soon, in 1919, he took out a patent on it.<ref name=alegi_17>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|p=17}}</ref>\n\nCaproni was aware of the [[Air safety|safety]] problems connected to passenger flights, such concerns being the root of Douhet's criticism. So, he concentrated on both improving the aircraft's reliability and minimizing the damage that could be caused by possible accidents. First of all, he conceived his large seaplane as a multi-engine aircraft featuring enough motors to allow it to keep flying even in case of the failure of one or more of them. He also considered (but then discarded) the opportunity of providing the aircraft with \"backup engines\" that could be shut off once the [[Cruise (aeronautics)|cruise]] altitude had been reached and only restarted in case of emergency.<ref name=alegi_17/> The seaplane configuration assured the capability of performing relatively safe and easy [[Emergency landing|emergency]] [[water landing]]s on virtually any water surface calm and large enough. Moreover, Caproni intended to improve the comfort of the passengers by increasing the cruise altitude, which he meant to achieve with [[turbocharger]]s and [[variable-pitch propeller]]s (such devices could compensate for the loss of power output of the engines at high altitude).<ref name=alegi_17/>\n\n[[File:Ca.60 under costruction.jpg|thumb|The Transaereo under construction in [[Sesto Calende]]. [[Gianni Caproni]] is sitting on the left side [[outrigger]].]]\n\nThe construction of the model 3000, or Transaereo,{{refn|group=N|name=name}} began in the second half of 1919. The earliest reference to this event is found in a French daily newspaper of August 10, 1919, and perhaps the first parts were built in the Caproni factory of [[Vizzola Ticino]]. In September an air fair took place at the Caproni factory in [[Taliedo]], not far from [[Milan]], during which the new, ambitious project was heavily publicized.<ref name=alegi_18>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|p=18}}</ref> Later in September, Caproni experimented with a Caproni Ca.4 seaplane to improve his calculations for the Transaereo. In 1920, the huge [[hangar]] where most of the construction of the Transaereo was to take place was built in [[Sesto Calende]], on the shore of [[Lake Maggiore]]. The several parts built by Caproni's subcontractors, many of whom had already collaborated with the company during the Great War, were assembled here.<ref name=alegi_18/>\n\nAt the end of the year, the construction yard was visited by [[United States Ambassador to Italy]] [[Robert Underwood Johnson]], who admired Caproni's exceptional aircraft. The press affirmed that the aircraft would be able to begin test flights in January 1921, and added that, were the tests successful, Italy would swiftly gain international supremacy in the field of civil aerial transport.<ref name=alegi_18/>\n\nOn January 10, 1921 the forward engines and nacelles were tested, and no dangerous vibrations were recorded. On January 12 two of the aft engines were also successfully tested. On the fifteenth, Caproni forwarded his request for permission to undertake test flights to the Inspector General of Aeronautics, General Omodeo De Siebert.<ref name=alegi_20>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|p=20}}</ref>\n\n== Design ==\nThe Transaereo was a large [[flying boat]], whose main [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], which contained the [[Aircraft cabin|cabin]], hung below three sets of [[wing]]s each composed of [[Triplane|three superimposed aerodynamic surfaces]]: one set was located fore of the hull, one aft and one in the center (a little lower than the other two).<ref name=alegi_17/> The [[wingspan]] of each of the nine wings was 30&nbsp;[[Meter|m]] (98&nbsp;[[Foot (unit)|ft]] 5&nbsp;[[Inch|in]]), and the total wing area was 750.00&nbsp;[[Square meter|m\u00b2]]&nbsp;(8073&nbsp;[[Square foot|ft\u00b2]]); the fuselage was 23.45&nbsp;m (77&nbsp;ft) long and the whole structure, from the bottom of the hull to the top of the wings, was 9.15&nbsp;m (30&nbsp;ft) high.<ref name=angelucci/> The [[Manufacturer's empty weight|empty weight]] was 14,000&nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]] (30,865&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]]) and the [[maximum takeoff weight]] was 26,000&nbsp;kg (57,320&nbsp;lb).<ref name=aaa/>\n\n[[File:Caproni Ca.60 modeli in Volandia Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Scale model of the Transaereo, at the [[Volandia]] museum.

[[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)|Roll]] (the aircraft's rotation about the longitudinal axis) was controlled in a completely conventional way by the differential action of [[port and starboard]] ailerons; [[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)|pitch]] (the aircraft's rotation about the transverse axis) was controlled by the differential action of fore and aft ailerons, since the aircraft didn't have [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevators]]; four articulated vertical surfaces located between the wings of the aftmost wing set acted as [[vertical stabilizer]]s and rudders controlling the [[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)|yaw]] (the aircraft's rotation about the vertical axis).<ref name=alegi_17-18>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|pp=17\u201318}}</ref> Wings had a positive [[Dihedral (aeronautics)|dihedral angle]], which contributed to stabilizing the aircraft on the roll axis; Caproni also expected the Transaereo to be very stable on the pitch axis because of the tandem-triplane configuration, for the aft wing set was supposed to act as a very big and efficient stabilizer; he said that the huge aircraft could \"be flown with just one hand on the controls.\"<ref name=alegi_18/> Caproni had patented this particular control system on September 25, 1918.<ref name=alegi_17/>\n\n=== Propulsion ===\n[[File:Caproni Ca.60 Liberty engine.JPG|thumb|left|\nOnly one of the eight [[Liberty L-12]] engines of the Transeaereo survives, shown here on display at the [[Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics|Caproni Museum]].]]\n\nThe aircraft was powered by eight [[Liberty L-12]] [[V12 engine]]s built in the [[United States]].

Each group featured a central nacelle, containing two engines in a [[push-pull configuration]], all with four-blade [[Propeller (aircraft)|propellers]].  To either side were single-engine nacelles, with two-blade propellers.  In the forward engine group, these were [[tractor configuration|pulling]], while in the aft engine group, they were [[Pusher configuration|pushing]].\n\nAll nacelles had [[radiator]]s for the [[cooling liquid]].<ref>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|pp=18, 21}}</ref>  Each of the two fore side engines was connected to the central wing set and to the corresponding aft engine thanks to a truss boom with a triangular section.<ref name=alegi_18/>\n\nThe two central nacelles also housed an open-air [[cockpit]], for one flight engineer each, who controlled the power output of the engines in response to the orders given by the pilots via means of a complex system of lights and indicators located on electrical panels.<ref name=alegi_18/>\n\n[[File:Caproni Ca.60 engine control panel.JPG|thumb|right|A Transaereo engine control panel, on display at the [[Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics|Caproni Museum]].

The passenger cabin was enclosed, and featured wide panoramic windows. Travelers were meant to [[Airline seat|sit]] in pairs on wooden benches that faced each other\u2014two facing forward and two backwards.  It featured a [[Aircraft lavatory|lavatory]] at the rear end of the fuselage.<ref name=aeroplanicaproni_144>{{cite book|author=Gianni Caproni |title=Gli Aeroplani Caproni \u2013 Studi, progetti, realizzazioni dal 1908 al 1935 |publisher=Museo Caproni |location=Milano |year=1937 |p=144 |language=it}}</ref>\n\nAn open-air cockpit was positioned above and slightly behind the forward windows.  It accommodated a [[pilot in command]] and a [[co-pilot]] side-by-side. Its floor was raised above the passenger cabin floor, so that the shoulders and heads of the pilots protruded through the roof. The flight deck could be reached from inside the fuselage by a ladder.\n\nBesides the main hull, the aircraft was fitted with two side floats located under the central wing set, acting as [[outriggers]] which stabilized the aircraft during static floating, [[takeoff]] and [[landing]].  Caproni had [[Alessandro Guidoni]], one of the most important seaplane designers of the time, create the hull and floats, the hydrodynamic surfaces that connected them and the two small hydrofoils located close to the nose of the aircraft:<ref name=alegi_18/> Guidoni designed new and innovative floats for the Transaereo to reduce dimensions and weight.<ref name=alegi_18/>\n\n== Test flights ==\nThe Transaereo was taken out of its hangar for the first time on January 20, 1921, and on that day it was extensively photographed. On January 21, the aircraft was scheduled to be put in the water for the first time, and a cameraman had been hired to shoot some sequences of the aircraft floating on the lake. Because of the low level of the lake and of some difficulties related to the slipway that connected the hangar with the surface of the lake, the flying boat could not reach the water. After receiving De Siebert's authorization, the slipway was lengthened on January 24, and then again on 28.<ref>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|pp=20\u201322}}</ref> Operations were carried on among problems and obstacles until February 6, when Caproni was informed that 30 [[wing ribs]] had broken and needed to be repaired before the beginning of test flights. He was infuriated, and kept his employees awake through the night to allow the tests to begin on February 7. The ribs were fixed, but then a [[Starter (engine)|starter]] was found broken, causing Caproni's frustration, so that the tests had to be postponed again.<ref name=alegi_22>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|p=22}}</ref>\n\nOn February 9, finally, the Transaereo was put in the water its engines running smoothly and it started [[taxiing]] on the surface of the lake. The pilot was Federico Semprini, a former military flight instructor who was known for having once looped a [[Caproni Ca.3]] heavy bomber.<ref name=alegi_20/> He would be the test pilot in all the subsequent trials of the Transaereo; no tests were going to be performed with more than one pilot on board.\n\n[[File:The Caproni Ca.60 on Lake Maggiore, 1921.png|thumb|left|The Transaereo on Lake Maggiore.]]\n\nAlways keeping on the water surface, the aircraft made some turns, then accelerated simulating a takeoff run, then made other maneuvers in front of Gianni Caproni and other important representatives of the Italian aviation in the 1920s: [[Giulio Macchi (engineer)|Giulio Macchi]] and [[Alessandro Tonini]] of [[Aermacchi|Nieuport-Macchi]], [[Raffaele Conflenti]] of [[SIAI-Marchetti|SIAI]]. The tests were soon interrupted by the worsening of the weather conditions, but their outcome was positive. The aircraft had proved responsive to the controls, maneuverable and stable; it seemed to be too light towards the bow and at the end of the day some water was found to have leaked inside the fuselage, but Caproni was satisfied.<ref>{{harvnb|Alegi|November 2006|pp=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Caproni Ca.60 Transaereo scale model.JPG|thumb|left|A period scale model of the Transaereo, on display at the Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics. The position of the left outrigger is clearly visible, as well as the shape of the fore part of the hull.]]\n\nOn the next day, after reconsidering some of his calculations, Caproni decided to load the bow of the Transaereo with [[ballast]] before carrying out further tests, in order to keep the aircraft from pitching up excessively.\n\nMore taxiing tests were successfully carried out on February 11. On February 12 or March 2, 1921,{{refn|group=N|name=maiden}} the bow of the aircraft loaded with {{convert|300|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of ballast, the Transaereo reached the speed of {{convert|80|km/h|kn mph|abbr=on}} and took off for the first time. During the brief flight it proved stable and maneuverable, in spite of a persisting tendency to climb.<ref name=alegi_193_23-24>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|pp=23\u201324}}</ref>\n\nThe second flight took place on March 4. Semprini (according to what he later recalled) accelerated the aircraft to 100 or 110&nbsp;km/h (54\u201359&nbsp;kn, 62\u201368&nbsp;mph), pulling the [[yoke]] toward himself; suddenly the Transaereo took off and started climbing in a sharp nose-up attitude; the pilot reduced the [[throttle]], but then the aircraft's tail started falling<!--in a stall?--> and the aircraft lost altitude, out of control. The tail soon hit the water and was rapidly followed by the nose of the aircraft, which slammed into the surface, breaking the fore part of the hull. The fore wing set collapsed in the water together with the nose of the aircraft, while the central and the aft wing sets, together with the tail of the aircraft, kept floating. The pilot and the flight engineers escaped the wreck unscathed.<ref name=alegi_32>{{harvnb|Alegi|November 2006|p=32}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Il Caproni Ca.60 dopo l'incidente, 4 marzo 1921.png|thumb|The wreck of the Transaereo is towed to shore after the accident, on March 4, 1921. The boat may be the same that interfered with the aircraft's takeoff, possibly causing it to crash.]]\n\nCaproni, coming from Vizzola Ticino by automobile, was delayed, and only arrived on the shore of Lake Maggiore after the Transaereo had crashed. He later commented, \"So the fruit of years of work, an aircraft that was to form the basis of future aviation, all is lost in a moment. But one must not be shocked if one wants to progress. The path of progress is strewn with suffering.\"<ref name=alegi_32/>\n\nAt the time, the accident was blamed on two concurrent causes. First, the wake of a steamboat that was navigating on the lake close to the area where the Transaereo was accelerating was thought to have interfered with the takeoff. Second, test pilot Semprini was blamed for having kept pulling the yoke trying to gain altitude while he should have performed corrective maneuvers, for example lowering the nose to let the huge aircraft gain speed.<ref name=alegi_32/> Another theory suggests the aforementioned boat was a ferry loaded with passengers and Semprini (who was only performing some taxiing trials, for he didn't mean to take off before Caproni's arrival on the spot) was suddenly compelled to take off, in spite of the insufficient speed, to avoid a collision.<ref name=museo>{{cite web|url=http://www.museocaproni.it/index.php/it/collezioni/43-caproni/935-aenean-quis-2 |title=Caproni Ca.60 |website=Museo dell'Aeronautica Gianni Caproni |accessdate=7 November 2014 |language=it}}</ref> According to more recent theories, the cause of the accident was probably the sandbags that had been placed in the aircraft to simulate the weight of passengers: not having been fastened to the seats, they may have slid to the back of the fuselage when, upon takeoff, the Transaereo suddenly pitched up. With the tail burdened by this additional load and a shift in the [[center of gravity]], the aircraft became uncontrollable and the nose lifted more and more, until the Transaereo [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stalled]] and violently hit the water tail first.<ref name=sfidadelvolo/>\n\n[[File:Museo dell'Aeronautica Gianni Caproni Ca.60 (2).JPG|thumb|The surviving fragments of the outriggers and of the lower front section of the main hull, on display at the [[Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics]].]]\n\n[[File:Caproni Ca.60 fragments in the Volandia aviation museum.JPG|thumb|More surviving fragments (a section of one of the truss-booms and one of the hydrofoils) are on display at [[Volandia]].]]\n\nBecause the photographer was on board the same car as Caproni, no photos exist of the takeoff, flight or crash, but many were shot of the wreck.<ref>{{harvnb|Alegi|November 2006|pp=32\u201335}}</ref>\n\nThe flying boat had sustained heavy damage in the crash, but the rear two-thirds of the fuselage and the central and aft wing sets were almost intact. However, the Transaereo had to be towed to shore. The crossing of the lake, performed thanks to a boat that may have been the same that had interfered with the takeoff, further damaged the aircraft: a considerable quantity of water leaked in the hull and the fuselage was partly submerged, while the central and aft wing sets got damaged and partly collapsed in the water.\n\nThe possibility of repairing the Transaereo was remote. After the accident, only the metallic parts and the engines were still usable. Almost all wooden parts would have to be rebuilt.<ref name=alegi_35>{{harvnb|Alegi|November 2006|p=35}}</ref> The cost of the repairs, according to Caproni's own estimate, would be one-third of the total cost of building the prototype, but he doubted the company's resources would be sufficient to sustain such a financial effort. After initial discouragement, however, on March 6 Caproni was already considering design modifications to carry on the project of a 100-passenger transatlantic flying boat. He was sure that the Transaereo was a promising machine, and decided to build a 1/4 scale model to keep on testing the concept.<ref name=alegi_35/>\n\nAfter discussing with De Siebert and [[Ivanoe Bonomi]] (who had been the [[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministry of War]] until shortly before), Caproni was convinced he could build a 1/3 scale model and Bonomi promised that, had he won the elections, his cabinet would grant him all the financial support he needed. However, even though Bonomi actually became [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] in July, more urgent political priorities ultimately caused the project of the Transaereo to be abandoned.<ref name=alegi_35/>\n\nEven if, overall, it was not successful, the Caproni Ca.60 keeps being considered \"one of the most extraordinary aircraft ever built.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|2003|p=164.}}</ref>\n\n== Aircraft on display ==\nMost of the damaged structure of the wreck was lost after the Transaereo project was eventually abandoned. Caproni, however, was convinced of the importance of preserving and honoring the historical heritage related to the birth and early development of Italian aviation in general, and to the Caproni firm in particular; his historical sensibility meant that several parts of the Transaereo, retrospectively known as the Caproni Ca.60, survived: the two outriggers, the lower front section of the main hull, a control and communication panel and one of the Liberty engines were spared and, after following the [[Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics|Caproni Museum]] in all its whereabouts between its foundation in 1927 and its move to its current location in [[Trento]] in 1992, they were displayed together with the rest of the permanent collection in the main exhibition hall of the museum in 2010.<ref name=alegi_35/><ref name=museo/>\n\nA section of one of the two triangular truss-booms also survived, as well as one of the hydrofoils that connected the main hull and the outriggers.<ref

Aviation historians consider the name \"Capronissimo\" to be totally unjustified from a historical point of view.<ref>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|pp=15, 17}}</ref><ref name=alegi_35 />}} It featured eight engines and three sets of triple wings.\n\nOnly one example of this aircraft, designed by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] [[aviation pioneer]] [[Gianni Caproni]], was built by the [[Caproni]] company. It was tested on [[Lake Maggiore]] in 1921: its brief maiden flight took place on February 12 or March 2.{{refn|group=N|name=maiden}} Its second flight was March 4; shortly after takeoff, the aircraft crashed on the water surface and broke up upon impact. The Ca.60 was further damaged when the wreck was towed to shore and, in spite of Caproni's intention to rebuild the aircraft, the project was soon abandoned because of its excessive cost.  The few surviving parts are on display at the [[Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics]] and at the [[Volandia]] [[aviation museum]] in Italy.\n\n== Development ==\n[[Giovanni Battista Caproni|Gianni Caproni]] became a famous aircraft designer and manufacturer during the [[First World War]]; his [[Caproni]] aviation company had major success, especially in the field of heavy multi-engine [[bomber]]s, building aircraft such as the [[Caproni Ca.32]], [[Caproni Ca.33|Ca.33]], [[Caproni Ca.36|Ca.36]] and [[Caproni Ca.40|Ca.40]]. The end of the conflict, however, caused a dramatic decrease in the demand for bombers in the Italian military.  As a result, Caproni, like many other entrepreneurs of the time, directed his attention to the civil aviation market.<ref name=alegi_15>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|p=15}}</ref>\n\nAs early as 1913 Caproni, then aged 27, had said during an interview for the Italian sports newspaper ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' that \"aircraft with a capacity of one hundred and more passengers\" would soon become a reality.<ref name=sfidadelvolo>{{Cite sign |title=La sfida del volo |trans-title=The Challenge of Flight |date=2011 |type=exhibition explanatory panel |publisher=[[Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics]] |location=[[Trento]] |language=it}}</ref> It was after the war, however, that (besides converting some of his large wartime bombers into [[airliner]]s) Caproni began designing a huge and ambitious passenger [[flying boat]]; he first took out a patent on a design of this kind on February 6, 1919.<ref name=alegi_15-17>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|pp=15\u201317}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of a large multi-engined flying boat designed for carrying passengers on long-range flights was considered, at the time, rather eccentric.<ref name=alegi_16>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|p=16}}</ref> Caproni thought, however, that such an aircraft could allow the travel to remote areas more quickly than ground or water transport, and that investing in innovative aerial means would be a less expensive strategy than improving traditional thoroughfares.<ref name=alegi_15/> He affirmed that his large flying boat could be used on any route, within a nation or internationally, and he considered operating it in countries with large territories and poor transport infrastructures, such as [[China]].{{refn|group=N|Caproni wrote: \"There are countries such as China, with immense distances and very backward means of transportation and communications: such countries will turn to the means [of transportation] that offers the greatest progress.\"<ref name=alegi_16/>}}<ref name=alegi_15-16>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|pp=15\u201316}}</ref>\n\nCaproni believed that, to attain these objectives, rearranging wartime aircraft would not be sufficient. On the contrary, he thought that a new generation of airliners (featuring extended range and increased payload capacity, the latter in turn allowing a reduction in cost per passenger) had to supersede the converted leftovers from the war.{{refn|group=N|Caproni also stated that: \"Taking into consideration two centers such as New York and Buenos Aires, it will be seen that, with today's communications, a letter takes about one month to go from New York to Buenos Aires, and another month for the return trip. [...] With an aircraft such as the triple-wing Caproni seaplane the New York\u2013Buenos Aires trip could be made in 3 or 4 days! Today a telegram, again between New York and Buenos Aires, takes one day; the cost is 53 cents or a dollar per word. What would happen if, at about the same cost, it were possible, in three, four days, to deliver to Buenos Aires not a telegram of a few words but a letter, a signed document, valuables, drawing, samples?\"<ref name=alegi_16/>}}\n\nIn spite of criticism from some important figures in Italian aviation, especially aerial warfare theorist [[Giulio Douhet]],<ref name=alegi_16/> Caproni started designing a very innovative aircraft and soon, in 1919, he took out a patent on it.<ref name=alegi_17>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|p=17}}</ref>\n\nCaproni was aware of the [[Air safety|safety]] problems connected to passenger flights, such concerns being the root of Douhet's criticism. So, he concentrated on both improving the aircraft's reliability and minimizing the damage that could be caused by possible accidents. First of all, he conceived his large seaplane as a multi-engine aircraft featuring enough motors to allow it to keep flying even in case of the failure of one or more of them. He also considered (but then discarded) the opportunity of providing the aircraft with \"backup engines\" that could be shut off once the [[Cruise (aeronautics)|cruise]] altitude had been reached and only restarted in case of emergency.<ref name=alegi_17/> The seaplane configuration assured the capability of performing relatively safe and easy [[Emergency landing|emergency]] [[water landing]]s on virtually any water surface calm and large enough. Moreover, Caproni intended to improve the comfort of the passengers by increasing the cruise altitude, which he meant to achieve with [[turbocharger]]s and [[variable-pitch propeller]]s (such devices could compensate for the loss of power output of the engines at high altitude).<ref name=alegi_17/>\n\n[[File:Ca.60 under costruction.jpg|thumb|The Transaereo under construction in [[Sesto Calende]]. [[Gianni Caproni]] is sitting on the left side [[outrigger]].]]\n\nThe construction of the model 3000, or Transaereo,{{refn|group=N|name=name}} began in the second half of 1919. The earliest reference to this event is found in a French daily newspaper of August 10, 1919, and perhaps the first parts were built in the Caproni factory of [[Vizzola Ticino]]. In September an air fair took place at the Caproni factory in [[Taliedo]], not far from [[Milan]], during which the new, ambitious project was heavily publicized.<ref name=alegi_18>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|p=18}}</ref> Later in September, Caproni experimented with a Caproni Ca.4 seaplane to improve his calculations for the Transaereo. In 1920, the huge [[hangar]] where most of the construction of the Transaereo was to take place was built in [[Sesto Calende]], on the shore of [[Lake Maggiore]]. The several parts built by Caproni's subcontractors, many of whom had already collaborated with the company during the Great War, were assembled here.<ref name=alegi_18/>\n\nAt the end of the year, the construction yard was visited by [[United States Ambassador to Italy]] [[Robert Underwood Johnson]], who admired Caproni's exceptional aircraft. The press affirmed that the aircraft would be able to begin test flights in January 1921, and added that, were the tests successful, Italy would swiftly gain international supremacy in the field of civil aerial transport.<ref name=alegi_18/>\n\nOn January 10, 1921 the forward engines and nacelles were tested, and no dangerous vibrations were recorded. On January 12 two of the aft engines were also successfully tested. On the fifteenth, Caproni forwarded his request for permission to undertake test flights to the Inspector General of Aeronautics, General Omodeo De Siebert.<ref name=alegi_20>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|p=20}}</ref>\n\n== Design ==\nThe Transaereo was a large [[flying boat]], whose main [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], which contained the [[Aircraft cabin|cabin]], hung below three sets of [[wing]]s each composed of [[Triplane|three superimposed aerodynamic surfaces]]: one set was located fore of the hull, one aft and one in the center (a little lower than the other two).<ref name=alegi_17/> The [[wingspan]] of each of the nine wings was 30&nbsp;[[Meter|m]] (98&nbsp;[[Foot (unit)|ft]] 5&nbsp;[[Inch|in]]), and the total wing area was 750.00&nbsp;[[Square meter|m\u00b2]]&nbsp;(8073&nbsp;[[Square foot|ft\u00b2]]); the fuselage was 23.45&nbsp;m (77&nbsp;ft) long and the whole structure, from the bottom of the hull to the top of the wings, was 9.15&nbsp;m (30&nbsp;ft) high.<ref name=angelucci/> The [[Manufacturer's empty weight|empty weight]] was 14,000&nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]] (30,865&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]]) and the [[maximum takeoff weight]] was 26,000&nbsp;kg (57,320&nbsp;lb).<ref name=aaa/>\n\n[[File:Caproni Ca.60 modeli in Volandia Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Scale model of the Transaereo, at the [[Volandia]] museum.

[[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)|Roll]] (the aircraft's rotation about the longitudinal axis) was controlled in a completely conventional way by the differential action of [[port and starboard]] ailerons; [[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)|pitch]] (the aircraft's rotation about the transverse axis) was controlled by the differential action of fore and aft ailerons, since the aircraft didn't have [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevators]]; four articulated vertical surfaces located between the wings of the aftmost wing set acted as [[vertical stabilizer]]s and rudders controlling the [[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)|yaw]] (the aircraft's rotation about the vertical axis).<ref name=alegi_17-18>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|pp=17\u201318}}</ref> Wings had a positive [[Dihedral (aeronautics)|dihedral angle]], which contributed to stabilizing the aircraft on the roll axis; Caproni also expected the Transaereo to be very stable on the pitch axis because of the tandem-triplane configuration, for the aft wing set was supposed to act as a very big and efficient stabilizer; he said that the huge aircraft could \"be flown with just one hand on the controls.\"<ref name=alegi_18/> Caproni had patented this particular control system on September 25, 1918.<ref name=alegi_17/>\n\n=== Propulsion ===\n[[File:Caproni Ca.60 Liberty engine.JPG|thumb|left|\nOnly one of the eight [[Liberty L-12]] engines of the Transeaereo survives, shown here on display at the [[Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics|Caproni Museum]].]]\n\nThe aircraft was powered by eight [[Liberty L-12]] [[V12 engine]]s built in the [[United States]].

Each group featured a central nacelle, containing two engines in a [[push-pull configuration]], all with four-blade [[Propeller (aircraft)|propellers]].  To either side were single-engine nacelles, with two-blade propellers.  In the forward engine group, these were [[tractor configuration|pulling]], while in the aft engine group, they were [[Pusher configuration|pushing]].\n\nAll nacelles had [[radiator]]s for the [[cooling liquid]].<ref>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|pp=18, 21}}</ref>  Each of the two fore side engines was connected to the central wing set and to the corresponding aft engine thanks to a truss boom with a triangular section.<ref name=alegi_18/>\n\nThe two central nacelles also housed an open-air [[cockpit]], for one flight engineer each, who controlled the power output of the engines in response to the orders given by the pilots via means of a complex system of lights and indicators located on electrical panels.<ref name=alegi_18/>\n\n[[File:Caproni Ca.60 engine control panel.JPG|thumb|right|A Transaereo engine control panel, on display at the [[Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics|Caproni Museum]].

It accommodated a [[pilot in command]] and a [[co-pilot]] side-by-side. Its floor was raised above the passenger cabin floor, so that the shoulders and heads of the pilots protruded through the roof. The flight deck could be reached from inside the fuselage by a ladder.\n\nBesides the main hull, the aircraft was fitted with two side floats located under the central wing set, acting as [[outriggers]] which stabilized the aircraft during static floating, [[takeoff]] and [[landing]].  Caproni had [[Alessandro Guidoni]], one of the most important seaplane designers of the time, create the hull and floats, the hydrodynamic surfaces that connected them and the two small hydrofoils located close to the nose of the aircraft:<ref name=alegi_18/> Guidoni designed new and innovative floats for the Transaereo to reduce dimensions and weight.<ref name=alegi_18/>\n\n== Test flights ==\nThe Transaereo was taken out of its hangar for the first time on January 20, 1921, and on that day it was extensively photographed. On January 21, the aircraft was scheduled to be put in the water for the first time, and a cameraman had been hired to shoot some sequences of the aircraft floating on the lake. Because of the low level of the lake and of some difficulties related to the slipway that connected the hangar with the surface of the lake, the flying boat could not reach the water. After receiving De Siebert's authorization, the slipway was lengthened on January 24, and then again on 28.<ref>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|pp=20\u201322}}</ref> Operations were carried on among problems and obstacles until February 6, when Caproni was informed that 30 [[wing ribs]] had broken and needed to be repaired before the beginning of test flights. He was infuriated, and kept his employees awake through the night to allow the tests to begin on February 7. The ribs were fixed, but then a [[Starter (engine)|starter]] was found broken, causing Caproni's frustration, so that the tests had to be postponed again.<ref name=alegi_22>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|p=22}}</ref>\n\nOn February 9, finally, the Transaereo was put in the water its engines running smoothly and it started [[taxiing]] on the surface of the lake. The pilot was Federico Semprini, a former military flight instructor who was known for having once looped a [[Caproni Ca.3]] heavy bomber.<ref name=alegi_20/> He would be the test pilot in all the subsequent trials of the Transaereo; no tests were going to be performed with more than one pilot on board.\n\n[[File:The Caproni Ca.60 on Lake Maggiore, 1921.png|thumb|left|The Transaereo on Lake Maggiore.]]\n\nAlways keeping on the water surface, the aircraft made some turns, then accelerated simulating a takeoff run, then made other maneuvers in front of Gianni Caproni and other important representatives of the Italian aviation in the 1920s: [[Giulio Macchi (engineer)|Giulio Macchi]] and [[Alessandro Tonini]] of [[Aermacchi|Nieuport-Macchi]], [[Raffaele Conflenti]] of [[SIAI-Marchetti|SIAI]]. The tests were soon interrupted by the worsening of the weather conditions, but their outcome was positive. The aircraft had proved responsive to the controls, maneuverable and stable; it seemed to be too light towards the bow and at the end of the day some water was found to have leaked inside the fuselage, but Caproni was satisfied.<ref>{{harvnb|Alegi|November 2006|pp=22\u201323}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Caproni Ca.60 Transaereo scale model.JPG|thumb|left|A period scale model of the Transaereo, on display at the Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics. The position of the left outrigger is clearly visible, as well as the shape of the fore part of the hull.]]\n\nOn the next day, after reconsidering some of his calculations, Caproni decided to load the bow of the Transaereo with [[ballast]] before carrying out further tests, in order to keep the aircraft from pitching up excessively.\n\nMore taxiing tests were successfully carried out on February 11. On February 12 or March 2, 1921,{{refn|group=N|name=maiden}} the bow of the aircraft loaded with {{convert|300|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of ballast, the Transaereo reached the speed of {{convert|80|km/h|kn mph|abbr=on}} and took off for the first time. During the brief flight it proved stable and maneuverable, in spite of a persisting tendency to climb.<ref name=alegi_193_23-24>{{harvnb|Alegi|August 2006|pp=23\u201324}}</ref>\n\nThe second flight took place on March 4. Semprini (according to what he later recalled) accelerated the aircraft to 100 or 110&nbsp;km/h (54\u201359&nbsp;kn, 62\u201368&nbsp;mph), pulling the [[yoke]] toward himself; suddenly the Transaereo took off and started climbing in a sharp nose-up attitude; the pilot reduced the [[throttle]], but then the aircraft's tail started falling<!--in a stall?--> and the aircraft lost altitude, out of control. The tail soon hit the water and was rapidly followed by the nose of the aircraft, which slammed into the surface, breaking the fore part of the hull. The fore wing set collapsed in the water together with the nose of the aircraft, while the central and the aft wing sets, together with the tail of the aircraft, kept floating. The pilot and the flight engineers escaped the wreck unscathed.<ref name=alegi_32>{{harvnb|Alegi|November 2006|p=32}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Il Caproni Ca.60 dopo l'incidente, 4 marzo 1921.png|thumb|The wreck of the Transaereo is towed to shore after the accident, on March 4, 1921. The boat may be the same that interfered with the aircraft's takeoff, possibly causing it to crash.]]\n\nCaproni, coming from Vizzola Ticino by automobile, was delayed, and only arrived on the shore of Lake Maggiore after the Transaereo had crashed. He later commented, \"So the fruit of years of work, an aircraft that was to form the basis of future aviation, all is lost in a moment. But one must not be shocked if one wants to progress. The path of progress is strewn with suffering.\"<ref name=alegi_32/>\n\nAt the time, the accident was blamed on two concurrent causes. First, the wake of a steamboat that was navigating on the lake close to the area where the Transaereo was accelerating was thought to have interfered with the takeoff. Second, test pilot Semprini was blamed for having kept pulling the yoke trying to gain altitude while he should have performed corrective maneuvers, for example lowering the nose to let the huge aircraft gain speed.<ref name=alegi_32/> Another theory suggests the aforementioned boat was a ferry loaded with passengers and Semprini (who was only performing some taxiing trials, for he didn't mean to take off before Caproni's arrival on the spot) was suddenly compelled to take off, in spite of the insufficient speed, to avoid a collision.<ref name=museo>{{cite web|url=http://www.museocaproni.it/index.php/it/collezioni/43-caproni/935-aenean-quis-2 |title=Caproni Ca.60 |website=Museo dell'Aeronautica Gianni Caproni |accessdate=7 November 2014 |language=it}}</ref> According to more recent theories, the cause of the accident was probably the sandbags that had been placed in the aircraft to simulate the weight of passengers: not having been fastened to the seats, they may have slid to the back of the fuselage when, upon takeoff, the Transaereo suddenly pitched up. With the tail burdened by this additional load and a shift in the [[center of gravity]], the aircraft became uncontrollable and the nose lifted more and more, until the Transaereo [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stalled]] and violently hit the water tail first.<ref name=sfidadelvolo/>\n\n[[File:Museo dell'Aeronautica Gianni Caproni Ca.60 (2).JPG|thumb|The surviving fragments of the outriggers and of the lower front section of the main hull, on display at the [[Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics]].]]\n\n[[File:Caproni Ca.60 fragments in the Volandia aviation museum.JPG|thumb|More surviving fragments (a section of one of the truss-booms and one of the hydrofoils) are on display at [[Volandia]].]]\n\nBecause the photographer was on board the same car as Caproni, no photos exist of the takeoff, flight or crash, but many were shot of the wreck.<ref>{{harvnb|Alegi|November 2006|pp=32\u201335}}</ref>\n\nThe flying boat had sustained heavy damage in the crash, but the rear two-thirds of the fuselage and the central and aft wing sets were almost intact. However, the Transaereo had to be towed to shore. The crossing of the lake, performed thanks to a boat that may have been the same that had interfered with the takeoff, further damaged the aircraft: a considerable quantity of water leaked in the hull and the fuselage was partly submerged, while the central and aft wing sets got damaged and partly collapsed in the water.\n\nThe possibility of repairing the Transaereo was remote. After the accident, only the metallic parts and the engines were still usable. Almost all wooden parts would have to be rebuilt.<ref name=alegi_35>{{harvnb|Alegi|November 2006|p=35}}</ref> The cost of the repairs, according to Caproni's own estimate, would be one-third of the total cost of building the prototype, but he doubted the company's resources would be sufficient to sustain such a financial effort. After initial discouragement, however, on March 6 Caproni was already considering design modifications to carry on the project of a 100-passenger transatlantic flying boat. He was sure that the Transaereo was a promising machine, and decided to build a 1/4 scale model to keep on testing the concept.<ref name=alegi_35/>\n\nAfter discussing with De Siebert and [[Ivanoe Bonomi]] (who had been the [[Ministry of Defence (Italy)|Ministry of War]] until shortly before), Caproni was convinced he could build a 1/3 scale model and Bonomi promised that, had he won the elections, his cabinet would grant him all the financial support he needed. However, even though Bonomi actually became [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] in July, more urgent political priorities ultimately caused the project of the Transaereo to be abandoned.<ref name=alegi_35/>\n\nEven if, overall, it was not successful, the Caproni Ca.60 keeps being considered \"one of the most extraordinary aircraft ever built.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Grant|2003|p=164.}}</ref>\n\n== Aircraft on display ==\nMost of the damaged structure of the wreck was lost after the Transaereo project was eventually abandoned. Caproni, however, was convinced of the importance of preserving and honoring the historical heritage related to the birth and early development of Italian aviation in general, and to the Caproni firm in particular; his historical sensibility meant that several parts of the Transaereo, retrospectively known as the Caproni Ca.60, survived: the two outriggers, the lower front section of the main hull, a control and communication panel and one of the Liberty engines were spared and, after following the [[Gianni Caproni Museum of Aeronautics|Caproni Museum]] in all its whereabouts between its foundation in 1927 and its move to its current location in [[Trento]] in 1992, they were displayed together with the rest of the permanent collection in the main exhibition hall of the museum in 2010.<ref name=alegi_35/><ref name=museo/>\n\nA section of one of the two triangular truss-booms also survived, as well as one of the hydrofoils that connected the main hull and the outriggers.<ref
