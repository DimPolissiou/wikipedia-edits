The University's [[Sir Frederick Mappin Building]] is named after him.\n\nHe was appointed an honorary [[Freedom of the City|Freeman]] of the City of [[Sheffield]] in 1900.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Lord Kitchener at Sheffield|day_of_week=Wednesday |date=1 October 1902 |page_number=9 |issue=36887| }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n*\"Mappin, Sir Frederick Thorpe\", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''\n*\"[http://www.made-in-sheffield.com/People/frederickThorpeMappin.htm Sir Frederick Thorpe Mappin]\", Made in Sheffield\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Hansard-contribs | sir-frederick-mappin | Sir Frederick Mappin }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par |uk}}\n{{s-bef |before=[[William Beckett-Denison]]\n        |before2=[[Francis Foljambe (Liberal politician)|Francis Foljambe]]}}\n{{s-ttl |title=[[Member of Parliament]] for [[East Retford (UK Parliament constituency)|East Retford]]\n        |years=1880\u20131885\n        |with=[[Francis Foljambe (Liberal politician)|Francis Foljambe]]}}\n{{s-non |reason=Constituency abolished}}\n{{s-new |constituency}}\n{{s-ttl |title=[[Member of Parliament]] for [[Hallamshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Hallamshire]]\n        |years=1885\u20131905}}\n{{s-aft |after=[[John Wadsworth]]}}\n{{s-bef |before=[[Spencer Charrington]]}}\n{{s-ttl |title=Oldest [[Member of Parliament]] |years=1904\u20131905}}\n{{s-aft |after=[[Samuel Young (Irish politician)|Samuel Young]]}}\n\n{{s-reg |uk-bt}}\n{{s-new |creation}}\n{{s-ttl |title=[[Mappin baronets|Baronet]]<br>'''(of Thornbury)''' |years=1886\u20131910}}\n{{s-aft |after=[[Sir Frank Mappin, 2nd Baronet|Frank Mappin]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mappin, Frederick}}\n[[Category:1821 births]]\n[[Category:1910 deaths]]\n[[Category:Councillors in Yorkshire and the Humber]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Legion of Honour]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:Lord Mayors of Sheffield]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1880\u20131885]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1885\u20131886]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1886\u20131892]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1892\u20131895]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1895\u20131900]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1900\u20131906]]\n[[Category:Master Cutlers]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1877-78 \u2192 1877\u201378", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Frederick_Mappin,_1st_Baronet"}

He is the inspiration for a hybrid [[Iris (plant)|Aril Iris]], ''Iris Sir Trevor Lawrence'' and a genus of orchids, ''[[Trevoria]]''.  The society also founded a gold medal in his honour.\n\n==Childhood and early adulthood==\n[[Image:The_Burford_Bridge_Hotel_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1356677.jpg|thumb|Burford Bridge Hotel, extended by the family]]\nLawrence was born on 30 December 1831, the son of [[Sir William Lawrence, 1st Baronet|Sir William Lawrence]] and [[Louisa Lawrence|Louisa Senior]], the daughter of a successful [[Mayfair]] [[haberdasher]] who had bought a country estate, Broughton House, near [[Aylesbury]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. {{refn|He was christened in April 1883 at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], Westminster.|group=note}} He was educated at [[Winchester College]] and at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]], where he took the diploma of [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|MRCS]] in 1853. He then worked for nearly ten years for the [[Indian Medical Service]]. Having inherited his mother's particular love for orchids, he reinforced this when he was in [[India]]. He made his first collection when living at [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]] in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] foothills.\n\nOn 5 July 1867, Lawrence succeeded to his father's recently created baronetcy (see [[Lawrence Baronets]]). In 1869 he married Elizabeth, daughter of John Matthew, a partner in the leading firm of marine engineers, [[John Penn (engineer)|John Penn and Son]] of [[Greenwich]]. She inherited Burford Lodge, [[Dorking]], where they created a celebrated garden at the foot of [[Box Hill, Surrey|Box Hill]].{{refn|At the time, the Burford Lodge estate  included the [[Burford Bridge Hotel]].|group=note}} They had three sons and one daughter:\n*[[Sir William Lawrence, 3rd Baronet|William Matthew Trevor Lawrence]] (17 September 1870 \u2013 4 January 1934); married Iris [[Eyre Crabbe]] (1908) and had issue.\n*[[Aubrey Lawrence|Aubrey Trevor Lawrence]] (15 January 1879 \u2013 23 March 1930); married Constance Emily Fanning McGaw (1901) and had issue.\n*Charles Trevor Lawrence (18 September 1881 \u2013 10 April 1953); married Adeliza Donnelly (1916).\n*Bessie Mary Lawrence (11 November 1877 - 12 March 1944); married Henry Rottenburg (1911) and had issue.\n\n==Political career==\nIn 1874 he unsuccessfully contested [[Gloucester (UK Parliament constituency)|Gloucester]] as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], but in 1875 was elected for [[Mid Surrey (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid-Surrey]], which included a large portion of south [[London]]. He sat for that constituency for ten years until its abolition in the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885|redistribution of seats in 1885]], when he was elected for [[Reigate (UK Parliament constituency)|Reigate Division]] in [[Surrey]], a seat he held for seven years. He did not seek re-election at the 1892 general elections. He confined himself in parliament largely to questions and speeches on constituency matters (such as the abolition of tolls on bridges over the [[River Thames]]) and matters of [[public health]] (he was a strong supporter of [[vaccination]]).  He made 20 contributions reaching Hansard, spanning 1886-8 and 1892.\n\n==Horticulture==\nLawrence's chief interest, however, was horticulture, an interest he had inherited from his mother, herself a horticulturalist of note. From 1885 to 1913 he was President of the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] (RHS) which increased greatly in numbers and means during this term. He was determined that it should be restored \u201cto horticulture pure and simple,\u201d rather than entertaining the public. He was chiefly responsible for moving the Society from its expensive [[Kensington]] site to a more practical home in [[Westminster]] in 1904. The society presented him with the [[Victoria Medal of Honour|Victoria Medal]] in 1900, a portrait painted by [[Hubert von Herkomer|Sir Hubert Herkomer]] in 1906, and the [[The Veitch Memorial Medal|Veitch Gold Memorial Medal]] 1913; it also founded the Lawrence Gold Medal in his honour.\n\nHe was one of the world's leading [[Orchidaceae|orchid]] collectors and asked his wife to give plants of botanical interest to [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew]] after his death: 580 were thought to qualify. He presided at the RHS conference on [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]isation in 1899, which is now officially regarded as the first international conference on [[genetics]].\n\nIn 1905, [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Professor M.

The youngest son of [[William Ewart Gladstone]], he was [[Home Secretary]] from 1905 to 1910 and [[Governor-General of the Union of South Africa]] from 1910 to 1914.\n\nAppointed whip in 1899, Gladstone was an innovator who provided a long-term strategy, kept the party from splitting over the [[Second Boer War]], introduced more modern constituency structures; and encouraged working-class candidates. In secret meetings with Labour leaders in 1903 he forged the [[Gladstone\u2013MacDonald pact]]. In two-member constituencies, it arranged that Liberal and Labour candidates did not split the vote. Historians give him much of the credit for the Liberal triumph in 1906, with 400 MPs and a majority of 243.<ref>Matthew, 2010</ref>\n\nRising to Home Secretary in 1906\u20138, he was responsible for the Workman's Compensation Act, a Factory and Workshops Act, and in 1908 the eight hour working day underground in the Coal Mines Regulation Act. Historian [[John Grigg, 2nd Baron Altrincham|John Grigg]] states that while his name is not often included in any list of radicals, his radical record is second to none in the Campbell-Bannerman Government. He was, to be sure, no firebrand, but a good party man whose common sense inclined him to be less 'Gladstonian' in the matter of State intervention then than his famous father had been. With his able under-secretary, [[Herbert Samuel]], he sponsored no less than 34 acts Acts of Parliament during his time at the Home Office.<ref>John Grigg, ''Lloyd George, the people's champion, 1902-1911'' (1978) .pp 148-49</ref>\n\n==Background and education==\nGladstone was the youngest son of Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] and his wife [[Catherine Gladstone|Catherine]], daughter of Sir Stephen Glynne, 8th Baronet, and was born in [[Downing Street]] where his father was living at the time as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. [[William Henry Gladstone]] and [[Henry Neville Gladstone, 1st Baron Gladstone of Hawarden|Lord Gladstone of Hawarden]] were his elder brothers.

E. Gladstone]], whom Queen Victoria detested.<ref>Magnus 1964, p212</ref> These feelings did not extend to his son. In September 1908 he permitted Roman Catholic priests in vestments, led by Cardinal Vanutelli, to carry the Host in a procession through the streets of London. There were a flood of protests, and the King asked Gladstone to ban the procession to avert a breach of the peace. The Home Secretary was on holiday in Scotland at the time, and did not reply, giving rise to false rumours that the King \u2013 who was known to take an interest in Roman Catholic rituals when abroad \u2013 favoured the procession. In the end the Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] had to ask Lord Ripon, the only Catholic Cabinet Minister, to ask for the Host and vestments to be cancelled.<ref name=\"Magnus 1964, p541\">Magnus 1964, p541</ref>\n\nThe following year the King rebuked Gladstone for appointing two women, Lady [[Frances Balfour]] and [[May Tennant]], to serve on a Royal Commission on reforming Divorce Law \u2013 the King thought divorce could not be discussed with \"delicacy or even decency\" before ladies. Philip Magnus suggests that Gladstone may have become a whipping-boy for the King's general irritation with the Liberal Government.<ref name=\"Magnus 1964, p541\"/>\n\nGladstone was sacked in the reshuffle in 1910 and the King agreed, with some reluctance, to appoint him the first [[Governor-General of the Union of South Africa]] as well as the [[High Commissioner]] there.<ref name=\"Magnus 1964, p541\"/><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=28363 |date=6 May 1910 |page=3162 }}</ref> He was appointed a [[Order of St Michael and St George|Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George]] and raised to the peerage as '''Viscount Gladstone''', of the [[Counties of Scotland|County]] of [[Lanarkshire|Lanark]], the same year.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=28350 |date=22 March 1910 |page=2029 }}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nAfter his return from South Africa in 1914, Lord Gladstone was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Bath]] (GCB),<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=28842 |date=19 June 1914 |page=4877 }}</ref> and spent much of the [[First World War]] being involved with various charities and charitable organisations, including the War Refugees Committee, the South African Hospital Fund, and the South African Ambulance in France.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the [[Order of the British Empire]] (GBE) in 1917.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30250 |date=24 August 1917 |page=8794 }}</ref>\n\n==Family==\nIn 1901 Lord Gladstone married Dorothy Mary, daughter of [[Sir Richard Paget, 1st Baronet]], who was over twenty years his junior. He died in March 1930, aged 76, at his [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]] home, and was buried in the town's Little Munden Church.

In September 1908 he permitted Roman Catholic priests in vestments, led by Cardinal Vanutelli, to carry the Host in a procession through the streets of London. There were a flood of protests, and the King asked Gladstone to ban the procession to avert a breach of the peace. The Home Secretary was on holiday in Scotland at the time, and did not reply, giving rise to false rumours that the King \u2013 who was known to take an interest in Roman Catholic rituals when abroad \u2013 favoured the procession. In the end the Prime Minister [[H. H.

It also won the [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], and Mendes won the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn April 6, 1917, [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War I|aerial reconnaissance]] has observed that the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], which has pulled back from a sector of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in northern [[French Third Republic|France]], is not in retreat but has made a strategic withdrawal to the new [[Hindenburg Line]], where they are waiting to overwhelm the British with [[artillery]]. In the British trenches, with [[field telephone]] lines cut, two young British soldiers, [[Lance Corporal]]s William Schofield, a veteran of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], and Tom Blake, are ordered by General Erinmore to carry a message to Colonel Mackenzie of the Second Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment]], calling off a scheduled attack that would jeopardise the lives of 1,600 men, including Blake's brother [[Lieutenant]] Joseph Blake.\n\nSchofield and Blake cross [[no man's land]] to reach the abandoned German [[Trench warfare|trenches]]. In an underground barracks, they discover a booby-trap tripwire, which is promptly triggered by a rat. The explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake saves him, and the two escape. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where a [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|German plane]] is shot down in a [[dogfight]] with Allied [[Aviation in World War I|aircraft]]. Schofield and Blake save the burned pilot, but the pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield. Schofield comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission and to write to Blake's mother. Taking Blake's rings and [[dog tag]], as well as Erinmore's letter, he is picked up by a passing British unit.\n\nA destroyed canal bridge near [[\u00c9coust-Saint-Mein]] prevents the British lorries from crossing, and Schofield chooses to part with them. He uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone, and comes under fire from a German [[sniper]]. He and the sniper shoot each other simultaneously; the sniper is killed, while Schofield is knocked out. He regains consciousness at night, and finds the town in flames. He encounters another German soldier, and escapes into an abandoned building, where he stumbles into the hiding place of a French woman with an infant. She treats his wounds, and he gives her and the infant his canned food and milk from the farm. Despite the woman's pleas, Schofield leaves, after hearing the chimes of a nearby clock that it is morning and time is running out. After encountering more German soldiers, he escapes by jumping into a river. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank. In the forest, he finds D Company of the 2nd Devons, which is in the last wave of the attack. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to reach Colonel Mackenzie.\n\nRealising that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield sprints across the open battlefield, just as the infantry begins its charge. He forces his way into meeting Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack. Schofield then finds Joseph, who was among the first wave but is unscathed. Schofield tells Joseph of his mission, and that his brother is dead, giving Blake's rings and dog tag to Joseph. Joseph is distressed about his brother, but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks to write to their mother about Tom's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Exhausted, Schofield sits under a tree, looking at photographs of his wife and two daughters.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as Lance Corporal William \"Will\"

She adds that the \"false heroics and filmmaking feats of wonder\" serve to provide an \"escape from the true carnage of the 'Great War'\", and that in reality the scale of the [[World War I casualties|casualties]] was such that the potential loss of 1,600 men would not have excited the response portrayed in the film.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/08/opinion/1917-movie-world-war-I.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 February 2020|first=Cathy|last=Tempelsman|accessdate=11 February 2020|title='1917' Turns a Horrific War Into an Uplifting Hero's Journey}}</ref>\n\nAccording to military historian Jeremy Banning, \"It made no sense, as the film depicts, to have some battalions nine miles beyond the former German line and others seemingly unaware of whether this line was manned. ...

In reality, the number of black soldiers serving in the [[British Army during World War I|British Army]] (rather than [[Colonial troops|colonial regiments]]) during World War I is unknown but is likely to have been negligible. The [[Devonshire Regiment]] was never brigaded with any West Indian or African units (it spent the war in [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Division]]). Over 15,000 men from the Caribbean enlisted, including black Caribbeans living in Britain, and by 1915 it was decided to group them together into a single regiment, named the [[British West Indies Regiment]].<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news |title=Fact-checking 1917: how historically accurate is Sam Mendes's First World War film? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/1917-fact-checking-how-historically-accurate-sam-mendes-war-movie/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-6RACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA97 |title=Colonial Soldiers in Europe, 1914\u20131945: \"Aliens in Uniform\" in Wartime Societies |pages=97\u2013102|date=22 December 2015|website=|isbn=9781317330981|last1=Storm |first1=Eric |last2=Tuma |first2=Ali Al }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=How accurate is Sam Mendes's film, 1917? |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-accurate-is-sam-mendess-film-1917-8mtbrbfkv |work=The Times |date=6 January 2020}}</ref> Indian [[Sikhs]] would have served in their own regiments as part of the [[British Indian Army]], not as individuals in the ranks of British regiments and Corps.

It also won the [[Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture]], and Mendes won the [[Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film]].\n\n== Plot ==\nOn April 6, 1917, [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War I|aerial reconnaissance]] has observed that the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]], which has pulled back from a sector of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in northern [[French Third Republic|France]], is not in retreat but has made a strategic withdrawal to the new [[Hindenburg Line]], where they are waiting to overwhelm the British with [[artillery]]. In the British trenches, with [[field telephone]] lines cut, two young British soldiers, [[Lance Corporal]]s William Schofield, a veteran of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], and Tom Blake, are ordered by General Erinmore to carry a message to Colonel Mackenzie of the Second Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment]], calling off a scheduled attack that would jeopardise the lives of 1,600 men, including Blake's brother [[Lieutenant]] Joseph Blake.\n\nSchofield and Blake cross [[no man's land]] to reach the abandoned German [[Trench warfare|trenches]]. In an underground barracks, they discover a booby-trap tripwire, which is promptly triggered by a rat. The explosion almost kills Schofield, but Blake saves him, and the two escape. They arrive at an abandoned farmhouse, where a [[Albatros Flugzeugwerke|German plane]] is shot down in a [[dogfight]] with Allied [[Aviation in World War I|aircraft]]. Schofield and Blake save the burned pilot, but the pilot stabs Blake and is shot dead by Schofield. Schofield comforts Blake as he dies, promising to complete the mission and to write to Blake's mother. Taking Blake's rings and [[dog tag]], as well as Erinmore's letter, he is picked up by a passing British unit.\n\nA destroyed canal bridge near [[\u00c9coust-Saint-Mein]] prevents the British lorries from crossing, and Schofield chooses to part with them. He uses what is left of the bridge to cross alone, and comes under fire from a German [[sniper]]. He and the sniper shoot each other simultaneously; the sniper is killed, while Schofield is knocked out. He regains consciousness at night, and finds the town in flames. He encounters another German soldier, and escapes into an abandoned building, where he stumbles into the hiding place of a French woman with an infant. She treats his wounds, and he gives her and the infant his canned food and milk from the farm. Despite the woman's pleas, Schofield leaves, after hearing the chimes of a nearby clock that it is morning and time is running out. After encountering more German soldiers, he escapes by jumping into a river. He is swept over a waterfall before reaching the riverbank. In the forest, he finds D Company of the 2nd Devons, which is in the last wave of the attack. As the company starts to move toward the front, Schofield tries to reach Colonel Mackenzie.\n\nRealising that the trenches are too crowded for him to make it to Mackenzie in time, Schofield sprints across the open battlefield, just as the infantry begins its charge. He forces his way into meeting Mackenzie, who reads the message and reluctantly calls off the attack. Schofield then finds Joseph, who was among the first wave but is unscathed. Schofield tells Joseph of his mission, and that his brother is dead, giving Joseph Blake's rings and dog tag. Joseph is distressed about his brother, but thanks Schofield for his efforts. Schofield asks to write to their mother about Blake's heroics, to which Joseph agrees. Exhausted, Schofield sits under a tree, looking at photographs of his wife and two daughters.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[George MacKay (actor)|George MacKay]] as Lance Corporal William \"Will\"

She adds that the \"false heroics and filmmaking feats of wonder\" serve to provide an \"escape from the true carnage of the 'Great War'\", and that in reality the scale of the [[World War I casualties|casualties]] was such that the potential loss of 1,600 men would not have excited the response portrayed in the film.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/08/opinion/1917-movie-world-war-I.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 February 2020|first=Cathy|last=Tempelsman|accessdate=11 February 2020|title='1917' Turns a Horrific War Into an Uplifting Hero's Journey}}</ref>\n\nAccording to military historian Jeremy Banning, \"It made no sense, as the film depicts, to have some battalions nine miles beyond the former German line and others seemingly unaware of whether this line was manned. ...

In reality, the number of black soldiers serving in the [[British Army during World War I|British Army]] (rather than [[Colonial troops|colonial regiments]]) during World War I is unknown but is likely to have been negligible. The [[Devonshire Regiment]] was never brigaded with any West Indian or African units (it spent the war in [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Division]]). Over 15,000 men from the Caribbean enlisted, including black Caribbeans living in Britain, and by 1915 it was decided to group them together into a single regiment, named the [[British West Indies Regiment]].<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news |title=Fact-checking 1917: how historically accurate is Sam Mendes's First World War film? |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/1917-fact-checking-how-historically-accurate-sam-mendes-war-movie/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-6RACwAAQBAJ&pg=PA97 |title=Colonial Soldiers in Europe, 1914\u20131945: \"Aliens in Uniform\" in Wartime Societies |pages=97\u2013102|date=22 December 2015|website=|isbn=9781317330981|last1=Storm |first1=Eric |last2=Tuma |first2=Ali Al }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=How accurate is Sam Mendes's film, 1917? |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-accurate-is-sam-mendess-film-1917-8mtbrbfkv |work=The Times |date=6 January 2020}}</ref> Indian [[Sikhs]] would have served in their own regiments as part of the [[British Indian Army]], not as individuals in the ranks of British regiments and Corps.
