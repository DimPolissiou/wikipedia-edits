In what has become a prominent feature of WWE's championship belts, the side plates featured removable center sections, allowing the holder's personal logo to be added to the championship belt; the default side plates showed silver and purple world maps with the WWE logo over them.

Above the globe was a banner that read \"Cruiserweight\" and below the globe was one that read \"Champion\". Ornamentation filled out the rest of the plate. In what has become a prominent feature of WWE's championship belts, the side plates featured removable center sections, allowing the holder's personal logo to be added to the championship belt; the default side plates showed silver and purple world maps with the WWE logo over them. The plates were on a purple strap. During [[Neville (wrestler)|Neville]]'s first reign, the color of the slash under the WWE logo on the center plate and default side plates was changed from purple to orange.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/786663-rich-swann-gets-custom-plates-on-cruiserweight-title-video-bubba-ray-hosting-raw-party-in-freehold-nj|title=Rich Swann Gets Custom Plates On Cruiserweight Title (Video), Bubba Ray Hosting RAW Party In Freehold, NJ|date=December 21, 2016|last=Hausman|first=Nick|work=Wrestle Zone|accessdate=December 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn January 25, 2020, Triple H and NXT General Manager William Regal presented a new NXT branded Cruiserweight Championship belt to then-champion [[Angel Garza]].

It was released in quick succession to her previous album, which had been released a year before and Sybil had had her biggest hit up to that point in the UK with a cover of \"[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]\" in early 1990. The album and its singles, however, were ignored by both radio and record buyers and did not chart. \n\nCassandra Lucas and Charisse Rose, who went on to form the successful R&B group [[Changing Faces (group)|Changing Faces]] in the mid-1990s, sang backing vocals on three tracks on the album, including the single \"Let It Rain\". They also appear on the videoclip to that song.\n\nThe album includes a cover of [[Bill Withers]]' hit \"[[Lovely Day (song)|Lovely Day]]\", and also features a song from Sybil's first album, \"Falling In Love\", which was given a new [[remix]]. The last three songs on the album are released as a continuous [[Medley (music)|medley]] titled \"The Let It Rain All Night Suite\".\n\nThe album spawned six singles. The lead single, \"[[Make It Easy on Me]]\", penned and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman was released in October 1990, but failed to gain much attention despite receiving good reviews for having a different sound to the trio of producers' usual [[Europop]] sound. Sybil would continue to work with [[Mike Stock (musician)|Mike Stock]] and [[Pete Waterman]] for her next album ''[[Good 'N' Ready]]''. The rest of the singles, released during 1991, failed to chart. These include \"Open Up the Door\", \"Go On\", \"Let It Rain\", and \"[[Lovely Day (song)|Lovely Day]]\". \"Falling In Love\" was released as a single exclusively in France, as a double a-side single with Sybil's 1988 single \"Can't Wait (On Tomorrow)\", featuring updated versions of both songs.\n\n\"Make It Easy on Me\" and \"Open Up the Door\" were later included in new updated versions on Sybil's album ''[[Good 'N' Ready]]'', and an updated \"Let It Rain\" was included on Sybil's album ''[[Doin' It Now!]]'', both released in 1993.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| title1          = [[Make It Easy on Me]]\n| length1         = 4:15\n| title2          = Open Up the Door\n| length2         = 5:10\n| title3          = Love's Got a Hold on Me\n| length3         = 4:36\n| title4          = First Lessons In Love\n| length4         = 4:31\n| title5          = Go On\n| length5         = 5:21\n| title6          = Falling In Love\n| length6         = 5:00\n| title7          = [[Lovely Day (song)|Lovely Day]]\n| length7         = 4:41\n| title8          = The Let It Rain All Night Suite: (A) Let It Rain\n| length8         = 4:15\n| title9          = The Let It Rain All Night Suite: (B) I Wanna Know What It Means\n| length9         = 5:08\n| title10         = The Let It Rain All Night Suite: (C) Gentle Man\n| length10        = 4:45\n}}\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline = French bonus track\n| title11         = Can't Wait (On Tomorrow) (Straight Run Mix)\n| length11        = 5:13\n}}\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline = German bonus track\n| title11         = [[Lovely Day (song)|Lovely Day]] (UK Remix)\n| length11        = 3:59\n}}\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n|[[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|U.S. R&B Albums Chart]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|70\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Sybil}}\n\n[[Category:1990 albums]]\n[[Category:albums produced by Stock Aitken Waterman]]\n[[Category:Sybil (singer) albums]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox album\n| name       = Sybilization\n| type       = [[Album]]\n| artist     = [[Sybil (singer)|Sybil]]\n| cover      = Sybil_Sybilization_album_cover.jpg\n| alt        =\n| released   = October 19, 1990\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[R&B]]\n| length     = 47:36\n| label      = {{hlist|[[Next Plateau Entertainment|Next Plateau]]|[[Pete Waterman Entertainment|PWL]]}}\n| producer   = Various\n| prev_title = [[Sybil (album)|Sybil]]\n| prev_year  = 1989\n| next_title = [[Doin' It Now!]]\n| next_year  = 1993\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/sybilization-mw0000318117|title=Sybilization - Sybil - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2017}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''Sybilization''''' is the third album by American singer [[Sybil (singer)|Sybil]], released in 1990.\n\n==Background==\n\nSybil worked with a myriad of producers for this album, including James Bratton, Eddie O'Loughlin, Stacey Harcum, [[Stock Aitken Waterman]] and others.

These include \"Open Up the Door\", \"Go On\", \"Let It Rain\", and \"[[Lovely Day (song)|Lovely Day]]\". \"Falling In Love\" was released as a single exclusively in France, as a double a-side single with Sybil's 1988 single \"Can't Wait (On Tomorrow)\", featuring updated versions of both songs.\n\n\"Make It Easy on Me\" and \"Open Up the Door\" were later included in new updated versions on Sybil's album ''[[Good 'N' Ready]]'', and an updated \"Let It Rain\" was included on Sybil's album ''[[Doin' It Now!]]'', both released in 1993.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| title1          = [[Make It Easy on Me]]\n| length1         = 4:15\n| title2          = Open Up the Door\n| length2         = 5:10\n| title3          = Love's Got a Hold on Me\n| length3         = 4:36\n| title4          = First Lessons In Love\n| length4         = 4:31\n| title5          = Go On\n| length5         = 5:21\n| title6          = Falling In Love\n| length6         = 5:00\n| title7          = [[Lovely Day (song)|Lovely Day]]\n| length7         = 4:41\n| title8          = The Let It Rain All Night Suite: (A) Let It Rain\n| length8         = 4:15\n| title9          = The Let It Rain All Night Suite: (B) I Wanna Know What It Means\n| length9         = 5:08\n| title10         = The Let It Rain All Night Suite: (C) Gentle Man\n| length10        = 4:45\n}}\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline = French bonus track\n| title11         = Can't Wait (On Tomorrow) (Straight Run Mix)\n| length11        = 5:13\n}}\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline = German bonus track\n| title11         = [[Lovely Day (song)|Lovely Day]] (UK Remix)\n| length11        = 3:59\n}}\n\n==Charts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n|[[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|U.S. R&B Albums Chart]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|70\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Sybil}}\n\n[[Category:1990 albums]]\n[[Category:albums produced by Stock Aitken Waterman]]\n[[Category:Sybil (singer) albums]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo/fmt (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybilization"}

McDonnell|Jim McDonnell]] to be the company's preliminary design manager.<ref>Thornborough and Davies 1994, p. 13.</ref> With no new aircraft competitions on the horizon, internal studies concluded the Navy had the greatest need for a new and different aircraft type: an attack fighter.<ref>Thornborough and Davies 1994, p. 11.</ref>\n\n[[File:McDonnell F3H-G mockup in 1954.jpg|thumb|The McDonnell F3H-G/H mockup, 1954]]\nIn 1953, McDonnell Aircraft began work on revising its [[McDonnell F3H Demon|F3H Demon]] naval fighter, seeking expanded capabilities and better performance. The company developed several projects, including a variant powered by a Wright J67 engine,<ref name=\"Demonp61\">Dorr 2008, p. 61.</ref> and variants powered by two [[Wright J65]] engines, or two [[General Electric J79]] engines.<ref name=\"Boeing development\">[http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/bluebook/develop.htm \"Phabulous 40th: Phantom Development.\"] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090907090450/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/bluebook/develop.htm |date=7 September 2009}} ''1978 Commemorative Book''. Boeing. Retrieved: 14 February 2008.</ref>  The J79-powered version promised a top speed of [[Mach number |Mach]]&nbsp;1.97. On 19 September 1953, McDonnell approached the [[United States Navy]] with a proposal for the \"Super Demon\". Uniquely, the aircraft was to be modular, as it could be fitted with one- or two-seat noses for different missions, with different nose cones to accommodate radar, photo cameras, four 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) cannon, or 56 [[Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket|FFAR]] unguided rockets in addition to the nine [[hardpoint]]s under the wings and the fuselage. The Navy was sufficiently interested to order a full-scale mock-up of the F3H-G/H, but felt that the upcoming [[Grumman F-11 Tiger|Grumman XF9F-9]] and [[Vought F-8 Crusader|Vought XF8U-1]] already satisfied the need for a supersonic fighter.<ref>Lake 1992, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe McDonnell design was therefore reworked into an all-weather fighter-bomber with 11 external hardpoints for weapons and on 18 October 1954, the company received a letter of intent for two YAH-1 prototypes. Then on 26 May 1955, four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and, within an hour, presented the company with an entirely new set of requirements. Because the Navy already had the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]] for ground attack and [[F-8 Crusader]] for dogfighting, the project now had to fulfill the need for an all-weather fleet defense interceptor. A second crewman was added to operate the powerful radar.<ref name=\"swan navyp301\"/>\n\n===XF4H-1 prototype===\n[[File:F4h-1 leadership.jpg|thumb|right|Key figures in the F-4 development: [[David S. Lewis|David Lewis]], Robert Little, and Herman Barkey]]\nThe XF4H-1 was designed to carry four semi-recessed [[AIM-7 Sparrow|AAM-N-6 Sparrow III]] radar-guided missiles, and to be powered by two J79-GE-8 engines. As in the [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo]], the engines sat low in the fuselage to maximize internal fuel capacity and ingested air through [[intake ramp|fixed geometry intake]]s. The thin-section wing had a [[leading edge]] sweep of 45\u00b0 and was equipped with [[blown flap]]s for better low-speed handling.<ref name=\"quest for performance\"/>\n\n[[Wind tunnel]] testing had revealed lateral instability, requiring the addition of 5\u00b0 [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] to the wings.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/> To avoid redesigning the titanium central section of the aircraft, McDonnell engineers angled up only the outer portions of the wings by 12\u00b0, which averaged to the required 5\u00b0 over the entire wingspan. The wings also received the distinctive \"dogtooth\" for improved control at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]]. The all-moving tailplane was given 23\u00b0 of [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] to improve control at high angles of attack, while still keeping the tailplane clear of the engine exhaust.<ref name=\"quest for performance\"/> In addition, air intakes were equipped with variable geometry ramps to regulate airflow to the engines at supersonic speeds. All-weather intercept capability was achieved thanks to the [[AN/APQ-50]] radar. To accommodate carrier operations, the landing gear was designed to withstand landings with a sink rate of {{convert|23|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}}, while the nose strut could extend by some {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} to increase angle of attack at takeoff.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/>\n\n[[File:McDonnell F4H-1F Phantom II aboard USS Independence (CVA-62), in 1960.jpg|thumb|An F4H-1F aboard {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}}, April 1960]]\nOn 25 July 1955, the Navy ordered two XF4H-1 test aircraft and five YF4H-1 pre-production examples. The Phantom made its maiden flight on 27 May 1958 with Robert C. Little at the controls. A hydraulic problem precluded retraction of the landing gear, but subsequent flights went more smoothly. Early testing resulted in redesign of the air intakes, including the distinctive addition of 12,500 holes to \"bleed off\" the slow-moving [[boundary layer]] air from the surface of each [[intake ramp]]. Series production aircraft also featured [[Splitter plate (aeronautics)|splitter plates]] to divert the [[boundary layer]] away from the engine intakes. The aircraft soon squared off against the [[XF8U-3 Crusader III]]. Due to operator workload, the Navy wanted a two-seat aircraft and on 17 December 1958 the F4H was declared a winner. Delays with the J79-GE-8 engines meant that the first production aircraft were fitted with J79-GE-2 and \u22122A engines, each having 16,100&nbsp;lbf (71.8&nbsp;kN) of [[afterburner|afterburning]] thrust. In 1959, the Phantom began carrier suitability trials with the first complete [[launch and recovery cycle|launch-recovery cycle]] performed on 15 February 1960 from {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}}.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/>\n\nThere were proposals to name the F4H \"[[Satan]]\" and \"[[Mithras]]\".<ref name=\"Donald 2002\">Donald and Lake 2002, pp. 6, 8.</ref> In the end, the aircraft was given the less controversial name \"Phantom II\", the first \"Phantom\" being another McDonnell jet fighter, the [[McDonnell FH Phantom|FH-1 Phantom]]. The Phantom II was briefly given the designation F-110A and the name \"Spectre\" by the USAF, but neither name was officially used.<ref>Angelucci 1987, p. 316.</ref>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:F-4B VF-74 taking off 1961.jpg|thumb|right|VF-74 was the first operational U.S. Navy ''Phantom'' squadron in 1961]]\n\nEarly in production, the radar was upgraded to the Westinghouse [[AN/APQ-120|AN/APQ-72]], an [[AN/APG-50]] with a larger radar antenna, necessitating the bulbous nose, and the canopy was reworked to improve visibility and make the rear cockpit less [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]].<ref>Lake 1992, p. 21.</ref> During its career the Phantom underwent many changes in the form of numerous variants developed.\n\nThe USN operated the F4H-1 (re-designated F-4A in 1962) with J79-GE-2 and -2A engines of 16,100&nbsp;lbf (71.62&nbsp;kN) thrust and later builds receiving -8 engines. A total of 45 F-4As were built; none saw combat, and most ended up as test or training aircraft.<ref name=\"Edenp278\">Eden 2004, p. 278.</ref> The USN and USMC received the first definitive Phantom, the F-4B which was equipped with the Westinghouse APQ-72 radar (pulse only), a [[Texas Instruments]] AAA-4 [[Infra-red search and track]] pod under the nose, an AN/AJB-3 bombing system and powered by J79-GE-8,-8A and -8B engines of 10,900&nbsp;lbf (48.5&nbsp;kN) dry and 16,950&nbsp;lbf (75.4&nbsp;kN) [[afterburner]] (reheat) with the first flight on 25 March 1961. 649 F-4Bs were built with deliveries beginning in 1961 and [[VF-121]] Pacemakers receiving the first examples at [[NAS Miramar]].<ref name=\"Edenp278\"/>\n\nThe USAF received Phantoms as the result of Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]]'s push to create a unified fighter for all branches of the US military. After an F-4B won the \"Operation Highspeed\" fly-off against the [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart]], the USAF borrowed two Naval F-4Bs, temporarily designating them F-110A \"Spectre\" in January 1962, and developed requirements for their own version.

For a brief period, doctrine held that turning combat would be impossible at supersonic speeds and little effort was made to teach pilots [[air combat maneuvering]]. In reality, engagements quickly became subsonic, as pilots would slow down in an effort to get behind their adversaries. Furthermore, the relatively new heat-seeking and radar-guided missiles at the time were frequently reported as unreliable and pilots had to fire multiple missiles (also known as ripple-firing), just to hit one enemy fighter. To compound the problem, [[rules of engagement]] in Vietnam precluded long-range missile attacks in most instances, as visual identification was normally required. Many pilots found themselves on the tail of an enemy aircraft, but too close to fire short-range Falcons or Sidewinders. Although by 1965 USAF F-4Cs began carrying [[SUU-16]] external gunpods containing a 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) [[M61 Vulcan|M61A1 Vulcan]] Gatling cannon, USAF cockpits were not equipped with lead-computing gunsights until the introduction of the [[SUU-23]], virtually assuring a miss in a maneuvering fight. Some Marine Corps aircraft carried two pods for strafing. In addition to the loss of performance due to [[drag (physics)|drag]], combat showed the externally mounted cannon to be inaccurate unless frequently [[Boresight (firearm)|boresighted]], yet far more cost-effective than missiles. The lack of a cannon was finally addressed by adding an internally mounted 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) M61A1 Vulcan on the F-4E.<ref name=\"Higham 1978\">Higham and Williams 1978.</ref>\n\n===Costs===\n<!-- Approximately a five-fold increase from 1965 to 2005 -->\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n!||F-4C||RF-4C||F-4D||F-4E\n|-\n|Unit [[Research and development|R&D]] cost|| \u2013 || 61,200 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|61200|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973 || \u2013 || 22,700 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|22700|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973\n|-\n|Airframe|| 1,388,725 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1388725|1965}}}} (Current)|| 1,679,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1679000|1965}}}} (Current) || 1,018,682 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1018682|1965}}}} (Current)|| 1,662,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1662000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Engines|| 317,647 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|317647|1965}}}} (Current) || 276,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|276000|1965}}}} (Current)|| 260,563 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|260563|1965}}}} (Current) || 393,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|393000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Electronics|| 52,287 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|52287|1965}}}} (Current)|| 293,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|293000|1965}}}} (Current) || 262,101 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|262101|1965}}}} (Current) || 299,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|299000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Armament|| 139,706 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|139706|1965}}}} (Current)|| 73,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|73000|1965}}}} (Current)|| 133,430 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|133430|1965}}}} (Current) || 111,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|111000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Ordnance|| \u2013 || \u2013 || 6,817 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|6817|1965}}}} (Current)|| 8,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|8000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Flyaway cost|| 1.9&nbsp;million (1965) <br />{{Inflation|US|1.9|1965|r=1}} million (Current)|| 2.3&nbsp;million (1965) <br />{{Inflation|US|2.3|1965|r=1}} million (Current)|| 1.7&nbsp;million (1965) <br />{{Inflation|US|1.7|1965|r=1}} million (Current) || 2.4&nbsp;million (1965) <br />{{Inflation|US|2.4|1965|r=1}} million (Current)\n|-\n|Modification costs|| 116,289 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|116289|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973|| 55,217 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|55217|1965}}}} (2008) by 1973 || 233,458 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|233458|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973 || 7,995 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7995|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973\n|-\n|Cost per flying hour|| 924 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|924|1965}}}} (2008)|| 867 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|867|1965}}}} (Current)|| 896 (1965)<br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|896|1965}}}} (Current)|| 867 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|896|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Maintenance cost per flying hour || colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 545 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|545|1965}}}} (Current)\n|}\nNote: Original amounts were in 1965 U.S. dollars.<ref name=\"knaack\">Knaack 1978</ref> The figures in these tables have been adjusted for inflation to the current year.\n\n==Operational history==\n{{See also|McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II U.S. operators}}\n\n===United States Air Force===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" \n|+ USAF F-4 Summary for Vietnam War action\n|-\n!

The name \"Spook\" was coined by the crews of either the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing or the 4453rd Combat Crew Training Wing at [[MacDill AFB]]. The figure is ubiquitous, appearing on many items associated with the F-4. The Spook has followed the Phantom around the world adopting local fashions; for example, the British adaptation of the U.S. \"Phantom Man\"<ref name=\"Boeing Gee Whiz\"/> is a Spook that sometimes wears a bowler hat and smokes a pipe.<ref>[http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/images/ukspook.htm \"Phabulous 40th: UK Spook.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706151106/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/images/ukspook.htm |date=6 July 2009}} ''Boeing.''

It served as the principal [[air superiority fighter]] for the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps and became important in the [[attack aircraft|ground-attack]] and [[aerial reconnaissance]] roles late in the war.  During the Vietnam War, one U.S. Air Force pilot, two weapon systems officers (WSOs),<ref name=\"dorrp200-201\"/> one U.S. Navy pilot and one [[radar intercept officer]] (RIO) became [[Flying ace|ace]]s by achieving five aerial kills against enemy fighter aircraft.<ref name=\"Dorrp188-189\" /> The F-4 continued to form a major part of U.S. military air power throughout the 1970s and 1980s, being gradually replaced by more modern aircraft such as the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15 Eagle]] and [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]] in the U.S. Air Force, the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat |F-14 Tomcat]] in the U.S. Navy, and the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet |F/A-18 Hornet]] in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nThe F-4 Phantom II remained in use by the U.S. in the reconnaissance and [[Wild Weasel]] ([[Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses]]) roles in the 1991 [[Gulf War]], finally leaving service in 1996.<ref name=\"gulfp26\">Donald Spring 1991, p. 26.</ref><ref name=\"gulfvictoryp22\">Donald Summer 1991, p. 22.</ref>  It was also the only aircraft used by both U.S. flight demonstration teams: the [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds]] (F-4E) and the United States Navy [[Blue Angels]] (F-4J).<ref name=\"Phab40th\"/><ref name=\"Lake 1992, p. 190\">Lake 1992, p. 190.</ref><ref>Lake 1992, p. 203.</ref> The F-4 was also operated by the armed forces of 11 other nations.

The company developed several projects, including a variant powered by a Wright J67 engine,<ref name=\"Demonp61\">Dorr 2008, p. 61.</ref> and variants powered by two [[Wright J65]] engines, or two [[General Electric J79]] engines.<ref name=\"Boeing development\">[http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/bluebook/develop.htm \"Phabulous 40th: Phantom Development.\"] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090907090450/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/bluebook/develop.htm |date=7 September 2009}} ''1978 Commemorative Book''. Boeing. Retrieved: 14 February 2008.</ref>  The J79-powered version promised a top speed of [[Mach number |Mach]]&nbsp;1.97. On 19 September 1953, McDonnell approached the [[United States Navy]] with a proposal for the \"Super Demon\". Uniquely, the aircraft was to be modular, as it could be fitted with one- or two-seat noses for different missions, with different nose cones to accommodate radar, photo cameras, four 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) cannon, or 56 [[Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket|FFAR]] unguided rockets in addition to the nine [[hardpoint]]s under the wings and the fuselage. The Navy was sufficiently interested to order a full-scale mock-up of the F3H-G/H, but felt that the upcoming [[Grumman F-11 Tiger|Grumman XF9F-9]] and [[Vought F-8 Crusader|Vought XF8U-1]] already satisfied the need for a supersonic fighter.<ref>Lake 1992, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe McDonnell design was therefore reworked into an all-weather fighter-bomber with 11 external hardpoints for weapons and on 18 October 1954, the company received a letter of intent for two YAH-1 prototypes. Then on 26 May 1955, four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and, within an hour, presented the company with an entirely new set of requirements. Because the Navy already had the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]] for ground attack and [[F-8 Crusader]] for dogfighting, the project now had to fulfill the need for an all-weather fleet defense interceptor. A second crewman was added to operate the powerful radar.<ref name=\"swan navyp301\"/>\n\n===XF4H-1 prototype===\n[[File:F4h-1 leadership.jpg|thumb|right|Key figures in the F-4 development: [[David S. Lewis|David Lewis]], Robert Little, and Herman Barkey]]\nThe XF4H-1 was designed to carry four semi-recessed [[AIM-7 Sparrow|AAM-N-6 Sparrow III]] radar-guided missiles, and to be powered by two J79-GE-8 engines. As in the [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo]], the engines sat low in the fuselage to maximize internal fuel capacity and ingested air through [[intake ramp|fixed geometry intake]]s. The thin-section wing had a [[leading edge]] sweep of 45\u00b0 and was equipped with [[blown flap]]s for better low-speed handling.<ref name=\"quest for performance\"/>\n\n[[Wind tunnel]] testing had revealed lateral instability, requiring the addition of 5\u00b0 [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] to the wings.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/> To avoid redesigning the titanium central section of the aircraft, McDonnell engineers angled up only the outer portions of the wings by 12\u00b0, which averaged to the required 5\u00b0 over the entire wingspan. The wings also received the distinctive \"dogtooth\" for improved control at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]]. The all-moving tailplane was given 23\u00b0 of [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]] to improve control at high angles of attack, while still keeping the tailplane clear of the engine exhaust.<ref name=\"quest for performance\"/> In addition, air intakes were equipped with variable geometry ramps to regulate airflow to the engines at supersonic speeds. All-weather intercept capability was achieved thanks to the [[AN/APQ-50]] radar. To accommodate carrier operations, the landing gear was designed to withstand landings with a sink rate of {{convert|23|ft/s|m/s|0|abbr=on}}, while the nose strut could extend by some {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} to increase angle of attack at takeoff.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/>\n\n[[File:McDonnell F4H-1F Phantom II aboard USS Independence (CVA-62), in 1960.jpg|thumb|An F4H-1F aboard {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}}, April 1960]]\nOn 25 July 1955, the Navy ordered two XF4H-1 test aircraft and five YF4H-1 pre-production examples. The Phantom made its maiden flight on 27 May 1958 with Robert C. Little at the controls. A hydraulic problem precluded retraction of the landing gear, but subsequent flights went more smoothly. Early testing resulted in redesign of the air intakes, including the distinctive addition of 12,500 holes to \"bleed off\" the slow-moving [[boundary layer]] air from the surface of each [[intake ramp]]. Series production aircraft also featured [[Splitter plate (aeronautics)|splitter plates]] to divert the [[boundary layer]] away from the engine intakes. The aircraft soon squared off against the [[XF8U-3 Crusader III]]. Due to operator workload, the Navy wanted a two-seat aircraft and on 17 December 1958 the F4H was declared a winner. Delays with the J79-GE-8 engines meant that the first production aircraft were fitted with J79-GE-2 and \u22122A engines, each having 16,100&nbsp;lbf (71.8&nbsp;kN) of [[afterburner|afterburning]] thrust. In 1959, the Phantom began carrier suitability trials with the first complete [[launch and recovery cycle|launch-recovery cycle]] performed on 15 February 1960 from {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}}.<ref name=\"Donald 2002\"/>\n\nThere were proposals to name the F4H \"[[Satan]]\" and \"[[Mithras]]\".<ref name=\"Donald 2002\">Donald and Lake 2002, pp. 6, 8.</ref> In the end, the aircraft was given the less controversial name \"Phantom II\", the first \"Phantom\" being another McDonnell jet fighter, the [[McDonnell FH Phantom|FH-1 Phantom]]. The Phantom II was briefly given the designation F-110A and the name \"Spectre\" by the USAF, but neither name was officially used.<ref>Angelucci 1987, p. 316.</ref>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:F-4B VF-74 taking off 1961.jpg|thumb|right|VF-74 was the first operational U.S. Navy ''Phantom'' squadron in 1961]]\n\nEarly in production, the radar was upgraded to the Westinghouse [[AN/APQ-120|AN/APQ-72]], an [[AN/APG-50]] with a larger radar antenna, necessitating the bulbous nose, and the canopy was reworked to improve visibility and make the rear cockpit less [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]].<ref>Lake 1992, p. 21.</ref> During its career the Phantom underwent many changes in the form of numerous variants developed.\n\nThe USN operated the F4H-1 (re-designated F-4A in 1962) with J79-GE-2 and -2A engines of 16,100&nbsp;lbf (71.62&nbsp;kN) thrust and later builds receiving -8 engines. A total of 45 F-4As were built; none saw combat, and most ended up as test or training aircraft.<ref name=\"Edenp278\">Eden 2004, p. 278.</ref> The USN and USMC received the first definitive Phantom, the F-4B which was equipped with the Westinghouse APQ-72 radar (pulse only), a [[Texas Instruments]] AAA-4 [[Infra-red search and track]] pod under the nose, an AN/AJB-3 bombing system and powered by J79-GE-8,-8A and -8B engines of 10,900&nbsp;lbf (48.5&nbsp;kN) dry and 16,950&nbsp;lbf (75.4&nbsp;kN) [[afterburner]] (reheat) with the first flight on 25 March 1961. 649 F-4Bs were built with deliveries beginning in 1961 and [[VF-121]] Pacemakers receiving the first examples at [[NAS Miramar]].<ref name=\"Edenp278\"/>\n\nThe USAF received Phantoms as the result of Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]]'s push to create a unified fighter for all branches of the US military. After an F-4B won the \"Operation Highspeed\" fly-off against the [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart]], the USAF borrowed two Naval F-4Bs, temporarily designating them F-110A \"Spectre\" in January 1962, and developed requirements for their own version. Unlike the US Navy's focus on air-to-air interception in the Fleet Air Defense (FAD) mission, the USAF emphasized both an air-to-air and an air-to-ground fighter-bomber role. With McNamara's unification of designations on 18 September 1962, the Phantom became the F-4 with the naval version designated F-4B and USAF F-4C.

For a brief period, doctrine held that turning combat would be impossible at supersonic speeds and little effort was made to teach pilots [[air combat maneuvering]]. In reality, engagements quickly became subsonic, as pilots would slow down in an effort to get behind their adversaries. Furthermore, the relatively new heat-seeking and radar-guided missiles at the time were frequently reported as unreliable and pilots had to fire multiple missiles (also known as ripple-firing), just to hit one enemy fighter. To compound the problem, [[rules of engagement]] in Vietnam precluded long-range missile attacks in most instances, as visual identification was normally required. Many pilots found themselves on the tail of an enemy aircraft, but too close to fire short-range Falcons or Sidewinders. Although by 1965 USAF F-4Cs began carrying [[SUU-16]] external gunpods containing a 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) [[M61 Vulcan|M61A1 Vulcan]] Gatling cannon, USAF cockpits were not equipped with lead-computing gunsights until the introduction of the [[SUU-23]], virtually assuring a miss in a maneuvering fight. Some Marine Corps aircraft carried two pods for strafing. In addition to the loss of performance due to [[drag (physics)|drag]], combat showed the externally mounted cannon to be inaccurate unless frequently [[Boresight (firearm)|boresighted]], yet far more cost-effective than missiles. The lack of a cannon was finally addressed by adding an internally mounted 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) M61A1 Vulcan on the F-4E.<ref name=\"Higham 1978\">Higham and Williams 1978.</ref>\n\n===Costs===\n<!-- Approximately a five-fold increase from 1965 to 2005 -->\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n!||F-4C||RF-4C||F-4D||F-4E\n|-\n|Unit [[Research and development|R&D]] cost|| \u2013 || 61,200 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|61200|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973 || \u2013 || 22,700 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|22700|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973\n|-\n|Airframe|| 1,388,725 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1388725|1965}}}} (Current)|| 1,679,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1679000|1965}}}} (Current) || 1,018,682 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1018682|1965}}}} (Current)|| 1,662,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1662000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Engines|| 317,647 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|317647|1965}}}} (Current) || 276,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|276000|1965}}}} (Current)|| 260,563 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|260563|1965}}}} (Current) || 393,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|393000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Electronics|| 52,287 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|52287|1965}}}} (Current)|| 293,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|293000|1965}}}} (Current) || 262,101 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|262101|1965}}}} (Current) || 299,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|299000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Armament|| 139,706 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|139706|1965}}}} (Current)|| 73,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|73000|1965}}}} (Current)|| 133,430 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|133430|1965}}}} (Current) || 111,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|111000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Ordnance|| \u2013 || \u2013 || 6,817 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|6817|1965}}}} (Current)|| 8,000 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|8000|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Flyaway cost|| 1.9&nbsp;million (1965) <br />{{Inflation|US|1.9|1965|r=1}} million (Current)|| 2.3&nbsp;million (1965) <br />{{Inflation|US|2.3|1965|r=1}} million (Current)|| 1.7&nbsp;million (1965) <br />{{Inflation|US|1.7|1965|r=1}} million (Current) || 2.4&nbsp;million (1965) <br />{{Inflation|US|2.4|1965|r=1}} million (Current)\n|-\n|Modification costs|| 116,289 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|116289|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973|| 55,217 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|55217|1965}}}} (2008) by 1973 || 233,458 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|233458|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973 || 7,995 (1965) by 1973 <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|7995|1965}}}} (Current) by 1973\n|-\n|Cost per flying hour|| 924 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|924|1965}}}} (2008)|| 867 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|867|1965}}}} (Current)|| 896 (1965)<br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|896|1965}}}} (Current)|| 867 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|896|1965}}}} (Current)\n|-\n|Maintenance cost per flying hour || colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 545 (1965) <br />{{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|545|1965}}}} (Current)\n|}\nNote: Original amounts were in 1965 U.S. dollars.<ref name=\"knaack\">Knaack 1978</ref> The figures in these tables have been adjusted for inflation to the current year.\n\n==Operational history==\n{{See also|McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II U.S. operators}}\n\n===United States Air Force===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" \n|+ USAF F-4 Summary for Vietnam War action\n|-\n!

However, the Falcon, like its predecessors, was designed to shoot down heavy bombers flying straight and level. Its reliability proved no better than others and its complex firing sequence and limited seeker-head cooling time made it virtually useless in combat against agile fighters. The F-4Ds reverted to using Sidewinders under the \"Rivet Haste\" program in early 1968, and by 1972 the AIM-7E-2 \"Dogfight Sparrow\" had become the preferred missile for USAF pilots.

The name \"Spook\" was coined by the crews of either the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing or the 4453rd Combat Crew Training Wing at [[MacDill AFB]]. The figure is ubiquitous, appearing on many items associated with the F-4. The Spook has followed the Phantom around the world adopting local fashions; for example, the British adaptation of the U.S. \"Phantom Man\"<ref name=\"Boeing Gee Whiz\"/> is a Spook that sometimes wears a bowler hat and smokes a pipe.<ref>[http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/images/ukspook.htm \"Phabulous 40th: UK Spook.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706151106/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/f4/images/ukspook.htm |date=6 July 2009}} ''Boeing.''

{"title_page": "Friction welding", "text_new": "'''Friction welding''' ('''FRW''') is a solid-state [[welding]] process that generates heat through mechanical [[friction]] between workpieces in relative motion to one another, with the addition of a lateral force called \"upset\" to plastically displace and fuse the materials. Because no melting occurs, friction welding is not a fusion welding process in the traditional sense, but more of a  [[forge welding]] technique. Friction welding is used with metals and [[thermoplastics]] in a wide variety of aviation and automotive applications.\n\n{{Anchor|Benefits}}\n\n==Advantages==\nThe combination of fast joining times (on the order of a few seconds) and direct heat input at the weld interface yields relatively small heat-affected zones. Friction welding techniques are generally melt-free, which mitigates grain growth in engineered materials such as high-strength heat-treated steels. Another advantage is that the motion tends to clean the surface between the materials being welded, which means they can be joined with less preparation. During the welding process, depending on the method being used, small pieces of the plastic or metal will be forced out of the working mass ([[Flash (manufacturing)|flash]]). It is believed that the flash carries away debris and dirt. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nAnother advantage of friction welding is that it allows dissimilar materials to be joined. This is particularly useful in [[aerospace]], where it is used to join lightweight [[aluminum]] stock to high-strength steels. Normally the wide difference in melting points of the two materials would make it impossible to weld using traditional techniques and would require some sort of mechanical connection. Friction welding provides a full-strength bond with no additional weight. Other common uses for these sorts of bi-metal joins is in the nuclear industry, where [[copper]]-[[steel]] joints are common in the reactor cooling systems; and in the transport of cryogenic fluids, where friction welding has been used to join aluminum alloys to stainless steels and high-nickel-alloy materials for cryogenic-fluid piping and containment vessels.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chart friction tabele.jpg|thumb|Friction welding tabele of dissimilar materials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nctfrictionwelding.com/|title=NCT Friction Welding - Inertia Welding - Roraty Welding - Spin Welding|website=NCT Inc.|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>]] -->\nFriction welding is also used with thermoplastics, which act in a fashion analogous to metals under heat and pressure. The heat and pressure used on these materials is much lower than metals, but the technique can be used to join metals to plastics with the metal interface being machined. For instance, the technique can be used to join eyeglass frames to the pins in their hinges. The lower energies and pressures used allows for a wider variety of techniques to be used.\n\n[[Sintering|Sintered]] materials such as [[Aluminium|Al]], [[Copper|Cu]], [[Titanium|Ti]], [[Magnesium|Mg]] alloys, heat resistant [[Nickel|Ni]] and [[Cobalt|Co]] alloys and refractory materials such as [[Tantalum|Ta]] and [[Molybdenum|Mo]] alloys can successfully be joined by friction welding.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/153447357.pdf|title=Friction Welding And Its Applications In Today's World|last=UZKUT|first=Mehmet|last2=\u00dcNL\u00dc|first2=Bekir|date=|website=|publisher=Celal Bayar \u00dcniversitesi|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|last3=YILMAZ|first3=Selim|last4=AKDA\u011e|first4=Mustafa}}</ref>\n\n== Disadvantages ==\n{{Expand section|date=September 2019}}\n\n* Working piece dimensional limitations\n**FRW is restricted mostly for round bars with similar cross-section; pieces of other forms are still possible to wield but it is much harder\n**Need to fix the workpiece\n**Joint design limitations\n* Impossibility to forge workpieces consisting of non-forgeable materials; difficulties associated with experimental materials\n* Cost of FRW equipment, high [[capital cost]]<nowiki/>s<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== History ==\nFriction welding was first developed in the Soviet Union, with first experiments taking place in 1956. The American companies Caterpillar, Rockwell International, and American Manufacturing Foundry all developed machines for this process.  Patents were also issued throughout Europe and the former Soviet Union.\n\n==Metal techniques==\n\n===Rotary friction welding===\nRotary friction welding (RFW), for plastics also known as [[spin welding]], uses machines that have two [[chuck (engineering)|chuck]]s for holding the materials to be welded, one of which is fixed and the other rotating.[[File:Rotary friction welding.jpg|thumb|Rotary friction welding.|alt=]]\n[[File:RFW Rotary friction welding handle.jpg|thumb|Rotary friction welding.]]\nIn ''direct-drive friction welding'' (also called continuous drive friction welding) the drive motor and chuck are connected. The drive motor is continually driving the chuck during the heating stages. Usually, a clutch is used to disconnect the drive motor from the chuck, and a brake is then used to stop the chuck.\n\nIn ''inertia friction welding'' the drive motor is disengaged, and the workpieces are forced together by a friction welding force. The kinetic energy stored in the rotating flywheel is dissipated as heat at the weld interface as the flywheel speed decreases. Before welding, one of the workpieces is attached to the rotary chuck along with a [[flywheel]] of a given weight. The piece is then spun up to a high rate of rotation to store the required energy in the flywheel. Once spinning at the proper speed, the motor is removed and the pieces forced together under pressure. The force is kept on the pieces after the spinning stops to allow the weld to \"set\".<ref>[http://www.mtiwelding.com/technologies/rotary-friction-welding] video and schematic diagram</ref>\n\nFriction work is converted into rise of temperature in the welding zone area, and as a result of this the weld structure is changed. Individual thermomechanical zones can be described by citing an example article:  R.McAndrew and others, \"A literature review of Ti-6Al-4V linear friction welding\", 2018.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=McAndrew|first=Anthony R.|last2=Colegrove|first2=Paul A.|last3=B\u00fchr|first3=Clement|last4=Flipo|first4=Bertrand C.D.|last5=Vairis|first5=Achilleas|date=2018-10-03|title=A literature review of Ti-6Al-4V linear friction welding|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmatsci.2017.10.003|journal=Progress in Materials Science|volume=92|pages=225\u2013257|doi=10.1016/j.pmatsci.2017.10.003|issn=0079-6425|via=}}</ref>\n\n''\"Technically the WCZ and the TMAZ are both \"thermo-mechanically affected zonez\" but due to the vastly different microstructures they possess they are often considered separately. The WCZ experiences significant dynamic recrystallisation (DRX), the TMAZ does not. The material in HAZ is not deformed mechanically but is affected by the heat.

Temperature measurements are also carried out for scientific purposes. For example, temperature may reduce material properties, (e.g. [[dynamic recrystallization]] will occur).\n\nDuring typical welding initially, the outer region heats up more, due to the higher linear velocity, next the heat spreads, the material is pushed outside, thus creating a flash.\n\n===Linear friction welding===\n''Linear friction welding'' (LFW) is similar to spin welding, except that the moving chuck oscillates laterally instead of spinning. The speeds are much lower in general, which requires the pieces to be kept under pressure at all times. This also requires the parts to have a high shear strength. Linear friction welding requires more complex machinery than spin welding, but has the advantage that parts of any shape can be joined, as opposed to parts with a circular meeting point. Another advantage is that in many instances quality of joint is better than that obtained using rotating technique.\n\nIn June 2016, the following materials could be welded: commercially pure copper (C101) /commercially pure aluminium (AA1050) /aerospace grade aluminium alloy (AA6082) /microalloyed steel (proprietary) /nickel alloy (Inconel 718) to conform a single part with all five materials joined as a demonstrator using LFW. Previously, a world-record weld interface area of 13,000 mm2 was successfully welded using similar materials welding: aluminium, steel and aerospace-grade titanium.\n\nThe most important parameters in the LFW process are Friction Pressure, Forging Pressure, Burn-off, Frequency, Amplitude, Stick out and perhaps their respective ramps or variation against time. ''Friction Pressure'' is that developed between the parts to be welded during the oscillation period. ''Forging pressure'' is that maintained for a short period of time after the oscillation is stopped and is typically around 20% greater than the ''Friction Pressure''. ''Burn-off'' is the change in length of the workpiece as its substance is turned into ''flash'' \u2013 material that escapes around the weld. ''Frequency'' and ''Amplitude'' describe the movement of the oscillator and hence of one of the parts to be welded. ''Stick out'' is the linear measurement of the amount of material that the parts have protruding from the tooling (oscillator and forging tooling).\n\n===Friction surfacing===\n''Friction surfacing'' is a process derived from friction welding where a coating material is applied to a substrate.  A rod composed of the coating material (called a mechtrode) is rotated under pressure, generating a plasticised layer in the rod at the interface with the substrate. By moving a substrate across the face of the rotating rod a plasticised layer is deposited, typically between {{convert|0.2|\u2013|2.5|mm|in}} thick with steels on steels, depending on mechtrode diameter and coating material.\nThe process can be used with various metals, including aluminium onto aluminium.\n\n==Thermoplastic technique==\n\n===Linear vibration welding===\nIn ''linear vibration welding'' the materials are placed in contact and put under pressure. An external vibration force is then applied to slip the pieces relative to each other, perpendicular to the pressure being applied. The parts are vibrated through a relatively small displacement known as the amplitude, typically between 1.0 and 1.8&nbsp;mm, for a frequency of vibration of 200&nbsp;Hz (high frequency), or 2\u20134&nbsp;mm at 100&nbsp;Hz (low frequency), in the plane of the joint. This technique is widely used in the automotive industry, among others.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110807125121/http://www.twi.co.uk/content/pjkfwplast.html Plastics joining - Friction welding techniques]</ref> A minor modification is ''{{visible anchor|angular friction welding}}'', which vibrates the materials by torquing them through a small angle.\n\n===Orbital friction welding===\nOrbital friction welding is similar to spin welding, but uses a more complex machine to produce an orbital motion in which the moving part rotates in a small circle, much smaller than the size of the joint as a whole.\n\n==Seizure resistance==\nFriction welding may unintentionally occur at sliding surfaces like bearings. This happens in particular if the lubricating oil film between sliding surfaces becomes thinner than the surface roughness, which may be due to low speed, low temperature, oil starvation, excessive clearance, low viscosity of the oil, high roughness of the surfaces, or a combination thereof.<ref>[http://www.substech.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=requirements_to_engine_bearing_materials Requirements to engine bearing materials, SubsTech]</ref>\n\nThe '''seizure resistance''' is the ability of a material to resist friction welding. It is a fundamental property of bearing surfaces and in general of sliding surfaces under load.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Friction stir welding]]\n* [[Forge welding]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.forgetechinc.com Forge Bonding]\n\n{{Metalworking navbox|weldopen}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Friction Stud Welding}}\n[[Category:Welding]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Metalworking navbox|weldopen}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Friction Welding}}\n[[Category:Plastic welding]]\n[[Category:Welding]]\n", "text_old": "'''Friction welding''' ('''FRW''') is a solid-state [[welding]] process that generates heat through mechanical [[friction]] between workpieces in relative motion to one another, with the addition of a lateral force called \"upset\" to plastically displace and fuse the materials. Because no melting occurs, friction welding is not a fusion welding process in the traditional sense, but more of a  [[forge welding]] technique. Friction welding is used with metals and [[thermoplastics]] in a wide variety of aviation and automotive applications.\n\n{{Anchor|Benefits}}\n\n==Advantages==\nThe combination of fast joining times (on the order of a few seconds) and direct heat input at the weld interface yields relatively small heat-affected zones. Friction welding techniques are generally melt-free, which mitigates grain growth in engineered materials such as high-strength heat-treated steels. Another advantage is that the motion tends to clean the surface between the materials being welded, which means they can be joined with less preparation. During the welding process, depending on the method being used, small pieces of the plastic or metal will be forced out of the working mass ([[Flash (manufacturing)|flash]]). It is believed that the flash carries away debris and dirt. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nAnother advantage of friction welding is that it allows dissimilar materials to be joined. This is particularly useful in [[aerospace]], where it is used to join lightweight [[aluminum]] stock to high-strength steels. Normally the wide difference in melting points of the two materials would make it impossible to weld using traditional techniques and would require some sort of mechanical connection. Friction welding provides a full-strength bond with no additional weight. Other common uses for these sorts of bi-metal joins is in the nuclear industry, where [[copper]]-[[steel]] joints are common in the reactor cooling systems; and in the transport of cryogenic fluids, where friction welding has been used to join aluminum alloys to stainless steels and high-nickel-alloy materials for cryogenic-fluid piping and containment vessels.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chart friction tabele.jpg|thumb|Friction welding tabele of dissimilar materials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nctfrictionwelding.com/|title=NCT Friction Welding - Inertia Welding - Roraty Welding - Spin Welding|website=NCT Inc.|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>]] -->\nFriction welding is also used with thermoplastics, which act in a fashion analogous to metals under heat and pressure. The heat and pressure used on these materials is much lower than metals, but the technique can be used to join metals to plastics with the metal interface being machined. For instance, the technique can be used to join eyeglass frames to the pins in their hinges. The lower energies and pressures used allows for a wider variety of techniques to be used.\n\n[[Sintering|Sintered]] materials such as [[Aluminium|Al]], [[Copper|Cu]], [[Titanium|Ti]], [[Magnesium|Mg]] alloys, heat resistant [[Nickel|Ni]] and [[Cobalt|Co]] alloys and refractory materials such as [[Tantalum|Ta]] and [[Molybdenum|Mo]] alloys can successfully be joined by friction welding.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/153447357.pdf|title=Friction Welding And Its Applications In Today's World|last=UZKUT|first=Mehmet|last2=\u00dcNL\u00dc|first2=Bekir|date=|website=|publisher=Celal Bayar \u00dcniversitesi|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|last3=YILMAZ|first3=Selim|last4=AKDA\u011e|first4=Mustafa}}</ref>\n\n== Disadvantages ==\n{{Expand section|date=September 2019}}\n\n* Working piece dimensional limitations\n**FRW is restricted mostly for round bars with similar cross-section; pieces of other forms are still possible to wield but it is much harder\n**Need to fix the workpiece\n**Joint design limitations\n* Impossibility to forge workpieces consisting of non-forgeable materials; difficulties associated with experimental materials\n* Cost of FRW equipment, high [[capital cost]]<nowiki/>s<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== History ==\nFriction welding was first developed in the Soviet Union, with first experiments taking place in 1956. The American companies Caterpillar, Rockwell International, and American Manufacturing Foundry all developed machines for this process.  Patents were also issued throughout Europe and the former Soviet Union.\n\n==Metal techniques==\n\n===Rotary friction welding===\nRotary friction welding (RFW), for plastics also known as [[spin welding]], uses machines that have two [[chuck (engineering)|chuck]]s for holding the materials to be welded, one of which is fixed and the other rotating.[[File:Rotary friction welding.jpg|thumb|Rotary friction welding.|alt=]]\n[[File:RFW Rotary friction welding handle.jpg|thumb|Rotary friction welding.]]\nIn ''direct-drive friction welding'' (also called continuous drive friction welding) the drive motor and chuck are connected. The drive motor is continually driving the chuck during the heating stages. Usually, a clutch is used to disconnect the drive motor from the chuck, and a brake is then used to stop the chuck.\n\nIn ''inertia friction welding'' the drive motor is disengaged, and the workpieces are forced together by a friction welding force. The kinetic energy stored in the rotating flywheel is dissipated as heat at the weld interface as the flywheel speed decreases. Before welding, one of the workpieces is attached to the rotary chuck along with a [[flywheel]] of a given weight. The piece is then spun up to a high rate of rotation to store the required energy in the flywheel. Once spinning at the proper speed, the motor is removed and the pieces forced together under pressure. The force is kept on the pieces after the spinning stops to allow the weld to \"set\".<ref>[http://www.mtiwelding.com/technologies/rotary-friction-welding] video and schematic diagram</ref>\n\nFriction work is converted into rise of temperature in the welding zone area, and as a result of this the weld structure is changed.

Dozens of models have been released over time, including the [[Apple Extended Keyboard]]. Currently, Apple offers only three keyboards via [[Bluetooth]]: [[Magic Keyboard]] (silver only), and Magic Keyboard with [[numeric keypad|Numeric Keypad]] (silver or space gray). The space gray model is also included with the [[iMac Pro]].\n\nBoth share a similar look and feel, based on a very thin aluminum chassis and laptop-style low-profile keys, sitting much closer to the tabletop than traditional keyboard designs.\n\n== Layout ==\n[[File:Apple key.jpg|thumb|An old version Command key, bearing the Apple logo]]\n[[File:Option-key.jpg|thumb|An older version Option key]]\n[[File:Apple Modifier Keys.jpg|thumb|The modifier keys]]\n\nTo serve the functionality of the [[Macintosh operating systems]] (and because of historical differences), the Apple Keyboard's [[keyboard layout|layout]] differs somewhat from that of the ubiquitous [[IBM PC keyboard]], mainly in its [[modifier key|modifier]] and special keys. Some of these keys have unique symbols defined in the [[Unicode]] block [[Miscellaneous Technical]]. Features different from other keyboards include:\n\n* The ''[[Command key|Command]]'' key ([[\u2318]]), used in most Mac [[keyboard shortcut]]s. The key functions as a [[Meta key]] in [[Unix-like]] environments, and is equally equivalent to the [[Windows key]] in Windows environments, although in common applications it performs the same function as the Windows [[Control key]]. Compared to their equivalents on the standard IBM PC keyboard layout the Command key and the Option key are located in reverse order.\n** The \"open\" (hollow) and separate \"closed\" (solid) Apple logo keys on the [[Apple II]] series, served functions similar to that of the Command key. The open-Apple key was combined with the Command key on [[Apple Desktop Bus]] keyboards (which were used on both the Apple IIgs and several years of Macintosh models) where it remained after the Apple II line was discontinued.\n* The ''[[Option key|Option]]'' key ([[\u2325]]), for entering [[diacritic]]s and other special characters. Like the [[Shift key|Shift]] and [[Control key|Control]] keys, the Option key serves as a modifier for the Command key shortcuts, as well as being used to type many special characters. It serves the function of the solid-Apple key in Apple II applications. It functions as the [[Alt key]] in Unix and Windows environments. Compared to their equivalents on the standard IBM PC keyboard layout the Command key and the Option key are located in reverse order.\n* Full-sized desktop keyboards with a dedicated [[Numeric keypad|numpad]] have [[function key]]s that can range up to F15, F16, or F19.<ref>[https://images.apple.com/keyboard/images/gallery/wired_1_20070813.jpg Image of the keyboard layout of a full-sized aluminum Apple keyboard] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803113151/http://images.apple.com/keyboard/images/gallery/wired_1_20070813.jpg |date=August 3, 2012 }}</ref> F17-F19 keys were introduced with the aluminium USB keyboard.<ref>[http://www.electronista.com/articles/07/07/27/new.imac.keyboard/ New slimline iMac keyboard revealed?], Electronista</ref> Compact keyboards such as the bluetooth wireless aluminium keyboard and the built-in keyboards on all Intel-based Macintosh notebooks range from F1-F12 only, just like IBM PC keyboards.\n* A ''Clear'' key, instead of a [[Num Lock]] key, on models with full [[numeric keypad]]s, as these are dedicated to numeric input and not generally used for cursor control. In Unicode, the Clear key is represented by {{unichar|2327|X IN A RECTANGLE BOX}}, defined as \"clear key\".<ref>{{cite web| title = Miscellaneous Technical| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2300.pdf| accessdate = April 7, 2013}}</ref>\n* An \"equals\" key ([[=]]) added to the numeric keypad.\n* A ''Help'' key, instead of an [[Insert key]], or on the most recent aluminum keyboards, a [[fn key]], which toggles the function of the [[function key]]s between their default functions and special functions (volume control, [[Mission Control (macOS)|Expos\u00e9]], etc.).\n* Notebook computers typically include additional assignments shared with function keys{{snd}}reduce and increase brightness, volume up, volume down, mute, and eject ([[\u23cf]]). Apple, since the release of the Pro Keyboard, provides these last four keys on desktop keyboards above the numeric keypad where status indicator lights are on many IBM PC keyboards. On the newest aluminum keyboard, these functions are accessed with the function keys, just like on the Apple laptops.\n* On [[Apple Desktop Bus]] keyboards, a [[power management keys|power key]] ([[\u25c1]]), used to turn on computers that supported it (and to type the Mac [[three-finger salute (computing)#Mac|three-finger salute]]). On keyboards with function keys, it was placed either on the left or right edge of the same keyboard row as the function keys; on keyboards without function keys it was placed in a central location above the other keys. The power key was replaced with a more conventional power button on early USB keyboards, thanks to a proprietary pin wired to the Macintosh's power supply in Apple's early USB implementations, subsequently eliminated on the Pro Keyboard along with the special power supply pin. Most of its functions were transferred to the eject (\u23cf) key in such later keyboards (holding down the control key simultaneously to make the eject key act like the power key).\n** On the Apple IIgs, this key, used in conjunction with the control key, is reset.  Used in conjunction with the open Apple key, reset reboots the computer.  Various other reset key combinations do various other things.\n* The Apple UK keyboard layout has the ''@'' and'' \" ''keys in their US locations (on the ''2'' and'' ' ''keys respectively). These are normally reversed on non-Apple UK keyboards.\n\n=== Usage of function keys ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! F1 !! F2 !! F3 !! F4 !! F5 !! F6 !! F7 !! F8 !! F9 !! F10 !! F11 !! F12\n|-\n!

These first keyboards had chocolate brown keycaps with white legends. The Apple II and Apple II+ keyboard had 52 keys, the Apple III keyboard, which included a numeric pad and some other additional keys, had 74. In 1983, the new Apple IIe and Apple III+ models introduced a beige keyboard with smaller black legends. In the same year, Apple introduced its first separate keyboard with the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]]; it incorporated a numeric keypad and lighter taupe-colored keycaps. It connected via a unique [[TRS connector|TRS]] port. The [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]] updated the look somewhat and separated the (optional) numerical keypad from the alphanumeric unit, all of which connected by telephone-style modular cables. By 1986, the [[Macintosh Plus]] re-integrated the numerical keypad and became the standard for all successive keyboards. However, it also marked the last of the beige Apple-II-era designs which were usurped by the newer [[Snow White design language]].\n\nFrom the end of 1986 until mid-1998, all new Apple keyboards were \"Platinum\" gray and connected via the [[Apple Desktop Bus]] (ADB). The Apple IIe and IIc line continued with integrated keyboards, as did the [[PowerBook]] portable line of course, those of the latter being a darker gray color called \"Smoke\". During the 90s, Apple offered various styles of keyboard, including the large [[Enhanced keyboard|extended keyboards]] which included the features of their [[IBM PC compatible|IBM PC AT]] counterparts.\n\nThe release of the [[iMac G3|first iMac]] in October 1998 introduced a matching compact, translucent-plastic keyboard based on laptop technology and marked the transition from ADB to [[USB]]. In July 2000, it was replaced with the full-sized Pro Keyboard, having slightly translucent black keys and a clear case. The PowerBook and [[iBook]] integrated keyboards followed suit with translucent keys first in bronze (PowerBook), then in black (PowerBook) and white (iBook). Coinciding with the introduction of the [[iMac G4]] in 2002, Apple started making its keyboards white. On the [[Bluetooth]] [[Apple Wireless Keyboard|Wireless Keyboard]], Apple removed the adjustable feet from the back of the keyboard, giving it a solid base. This design was later quietly introduced on the wired version. The [[AlBook|Aluminum PowerBooks]] added another color, opaque aluminum with sometimes-backlit translucent legends, to the array of keyboard styles in use.\n\n=== Current keyboards ===\nOn August 7, 2007, Apple introduced their current generation of keyboards. The new model is much thinner than its predecessors, requiring less wrist flexing and a slightly lower hand position for most users. Taking a cue from the portables, it has an aluminum enclosure, and the USB ports have been, once again, relocated to the right and left ends of the keyboard case. Software function and hardware control keys have a new arrangement, and there are keys associated with specific features of [[macOS]], such as [[Apple Dashboard (software)|Dashboard]]. In order to properly use these new features, a computer must be updated as of the initial ship date of the keyboards, usually with the built-in [[Apple Software Update|Software Update]].<ref>[https://www.apple.com/support/downloads/keyboardsoftwareupdate12.html Keyboard Software Update 1.2] ''Apple official support site'' Retrieved 2007-09-18<!--- If this ref dies: The \"12\" refers to the version number...try 13, 14, 20.... ---></ref>\n\nOn March 3, 2009, Apple introduced an additional keyboard to their latest line of keyboards. The new keyboard is similar to the wireless keyboard due to the absence of the numeric keypad, however it is a wired keyboard with 2 USB 2.0 ports similar to the standard keyboard. Until this time the typical keyboard with the numeric keypad was titled \"Apple Keyboard\", now the more-compact keyboard carries the name \"Apple Keyboard\" and the standard keyboard with numeric keys is titled \"Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad\".<ref>[http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB869?mco=NDE4Mzg3NA] Keyboard \u2013 Apple Store {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306142815/http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB869?mco=NDE4Mzg3NA|date=March 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Compatibility ==\n[[File:Mac lc keyboard port.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Apple Desktop Bus]] (ADB) connector]]\n\nApple's older ADB ([[Apple Desktop Bus]]) keyboards are compatible with other ADB-based systems, such as those from Next and Sony (and vice versa for their non-Apple ADB keyboards). When using a USB adapter (such as the Griffin iMate), they function similarly to Apple's later USB keyboards, although there can be problems using such setups with later versions of [[macOS]]. Although external ADB ports ceased to be used after the [[Power Macintosh G3 (Blue & White)]], Apple still used ADB as the internal protocol for their laptop keyboards and trackpads until the last-generation PowerBooks and iBooks; for this reason, ADB drivers can still be found in [[Mac OS X 10.5]] but not [[Mac OS X 10.6]]. Even with these operating systems, it is possible to use ADB devices with a USB adapter.\n\nApple's USB keyboards are mostly compatible with Windows computers, and can be remapped; the Command key works as the Windows key, the {{keypress|Option}} key as the Alt key, the [[Help key]] as the {{keypress|Insert}} key, and the {{keypress|Clear}} key as the {{keypress|Num Lock}} key. On the slightly older all-white models, the volume keys function as they would on a Macintosh, and the eject key has no function. With the new models released in August 2007 the volume, brightness, Expos\u00e9, dashboard, eject and media controls no longer work without installing Apple's Boot Camp software. This software allows for the volume, brightness, eject, and media controls buttons to work properly.\n\nThe additional function keys placed where the [[Print Screen]]/[[SysRq]], [[Scroll Lock]], and [[Break key|Pause/Break]] keys are on most IBM PC keyboards (F13/F14 through F15/F16) do not work as those keys in Windows without a special driver. Apple has since released a driver, though it is only available bundled with [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]].\n\nThe USB keyboard is also combined with a two-[[Computer port (hardware)|port]] USB [[USB hub|hub]], with the hub being [[USB 1.1]] on older keyboards and [[USB 2.0]] on the May 2003 Rev B. 2005 and August 2007 model.\n\n== Models ==\n=== Built-in keyboards ===\n[[File:Apple iieb.jpg|thumb|Apple IIe built-in keyboard]]\n\n* '''Apple II/II Plus''' \u2013 Introduced in 1977, the [[Apple II]] and [[Apple II Plus|II Plus]] came without a numeric keypad. There was also a black keyboard manufactured for a [[Bell & Howell]] edition.\n* '''Apple III/III Plus''' \u2013 Introduced in 1980, the [[Apple III]] and [[Apple III Plus|III Plus]] introduced a numeric keypad and special [[command key]]s.\n* '''Apple IIe/IIe Platinum''' \u2013 The [[Apple IIe]] series, introduced in 1983, once again eliminated the integrated numeric keypad, but offered an external one. However it did finally offer a \"delete\" key. In 1987 with the introduction of the Platinum IIe, the keypad was re-integrated and the keyboard was updated to conform to the newly released Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard.\n* '''Apple IIc/IIc Plus''' \u2013 Introduced in 1984, the [[Apple IIc]] was the first keyboard designed to be portable and lacked a keypad. In 1988 the keyboard changed color from beige to Platinum and was revised to match the layout of the Apple Desktop Bus keyboard, though still without provision for a keypad.\n* '''Macintosh Portable''' Apple's first truly portable computer, the [[Macintosh Portable]] released in 1989 had a full-sized Apple Keyboard with optional built-in numeric keypad or [[trackball]] mouse.\n* '''PowerBook''' \u2013 From 1991 to 2005, all of Apple's portable [[PowerBook]] computers have included a smaller keyboard in various colors and finishes, including dark gray, black, translucent bronze, charcoal, and an aluminum finish with backlighting. Along the way, they have also included special function keys and embedded keypads.\n* '''eMate''' \u2013 The dark green translucent keyboard of the [[eMate]] introduced in 1997, was essentially an [[Apple Newton]] keyboard.\n* '''iBook''' \u2013 In 1999, the [[iBook]] series introduced the first ever white keyboards. Debuting in a transparent finish, the later models were opaque.\n* '''MacBook/MacBook Pro/MacBook Air''' \u2013 In 2006, Apple introduced the [[MacBook]] series of computers. The [[MacBook Pro]] keyboard continued the aluminum treatment of the PowerBook line, while the MacBook remained white like the iBook before it and introduced a black model as well. The MacBook Air also used black keys. The introduction of the unibody MacBook series in 2009 saw a unification across all Apple keyboards to use black keys, the sole white keys remaining on the (now discontinued) [[MacBook#Polycarbonate model|white MacBook]].  Pre-unibody MacBook series keyboards included an overlaid numeric keypad like on the earlier PowerBook series and iBook series keyboards but Apple completely removed the numeric keypad from all unibody MacBook series keyboards.\n\n=== Apple Numeric Keypad IIe (A2M2003) ===\n[[File:Apple Numeric Keypad IIe.jpg|thumb|Apple Numeric Keypad IIe]]\n\nThe Numeric Keypad IIe was Apple's first external keypad. Released as an option specifically for the popular Apple IIe computer in 1983, it helped correct some of the II series' shortcomings. Later the Platinum IIe would incorporate the numeric keypad into its built-in keyboard.\n\n=== Lisa Keyboard (A6MB101) ===\nThe first keyboard not to be integrated into the [[CPU]] case like the Apple II and III series before it. It was designed for and came with the [[Apple Lisa]]. Like the Apple III before it, it was intended to be a business computer and included an integrated numeric keypad. Like all Apple computers before it, it came in a beige case to match the CPU and connected by a unique [[TRS connector]]. In addition it carried over the use of the \"open\" Apple key from the Apple III as a command key (though it was represented by the \"closed\" Apple character) and included a pullout reference guide hidden under the keyboard.\n\n=== Macintosh Keyboard (M0110) ===\n[[File:Apple Macintosh Plus Keyboard.jpg|thumb|Macintosh Keyboard]]\n\nIntroduced and included with the original Macintosh in 1984, it debuted with neither arrow keys to control the cursor nor an integrated numeric keypad. It used a telephone cord-style RJ-10 connector to the case (also used with the Amstrad PCW series of computers). The keyboard [[pinouts]] are \"crossed\" so it isn't possible to use a standard telephone cord as a replacement; doing so will result in damage to the keyboard or the computer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.networxsecurity.org/members-area/glossary/m/modular-connector.html|title=Modular Connector \u2013 4P4C \u2013 Data Port|website=Networx Security|access-date=2019-02-09|quote=The connector wiring, however, required a polarized straight through pinout. Using a telephone handset cable instead of the supplied cable could short out the +5 volt DC supply and damage the computer or the keyboard.}}</ref> The keyboard also introduced a unique command key similar to the \"open\" Apple Key on the Lisa.\n\n=== Macintosh Numeric Keypad (M0120) ===\nLike the Apple IIe before it, the Macintosh provided an optional external keypad which also included arrow keys that daisy chained to the CPU via the telephone-cord connectors. Though introduced with the Macintosh in January 1984, Apple did not ship it until September 1984 at a retail price of US$99.\n\n=== Macintosh Plus Keyboard (M0110A) ===\n[[File:Apple Macintosh Plus Extended Keyboard.jpg|thumb|The Macintosh Plus keyboard, like the original Macintosh Keyboard before it, used a coiled modular cable similar to a telephone handset cord.]]\n\nIntroduced and included with the Macintosh Plus in 1986, it was an extended keyboard that had a built-in numeric keypad. In 1987 it was updated to Apple's new Platinum gray color. It continued to use the telephone-cord style connector to the system and was interchangeable with the M0110. Though Apple switched all other keyboards to [[Apple Desktop Bus]] connectors by this time, this keyboard was manufactured unchanged for four more years until the Plus was discontinued in 1990.\n\n=== Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard (A9M0330) ===\n[[File:Apple IIgs Keyboard B.jpg|thumb|Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard]]\n\nThis was the first Apple keyboard to use the new [[Apple Desktop Bus]] (ADB) connector first seen on the [[Apple IIGS]]. Designed to be compatible with both the Macintosh and Apple product lines, it was the first to combine both the Macintosh command key and Apple II \"open\" Apple key legends. Entirely Platinum gray in color (later Macintosh Plus keyboards had a platinum gray case with darker gray keys called \"Smoke\"), it was also the first to use [[Snow White design language]] that was similar to the Apple IIc. However, it duplicated the extended design established by the Plus. It was also the first to include an external power/reset button and an extra ADB port.\n\n=== Apple Keyboard (M0116) ===\n[[File:Apple (Standard) Keyboard M0116.jpg|thumb|Apple (Standard) Keyboard]]\n\nAlso known as the ''Apple Standard Keyboard'', it was the first to officially use this name. Apple would later reuse the name for a series of successive keyboards. The ''Apple Keyboard'' was a more solid version of the ''Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard'' and optionally included with the [[Macintosh II]] and [[Macintosh SE|SE]] in 1987. The heftier design solidified visually the power performance embodied by the upgraded Macs. Aside from weight the main difference was the significantly thicker frame width. It was the first keyboard to be sold separately from the system, giving the customer a choice of the basic or advanced keyboards offered by Apple.\n\n===Apple Extended Keyboard (M0115) ===\n{{Main|Apple Extended Keyboard}}\n[[File:Apple Extended Keyboard.jpg|thumb|Apple Extended Keyboard II]]\n\nApple's advanced keyboard, the first to be sold optionally, was essentially a redesigned version of the ''Apple Keyboard,'' with an [[Enhanced keyboard|enhanced]] extended keyboard with [[Function key|FKeys]] and other [[IBM PC keyboard|PC-style keys]]. It included template guides above the top row of function keys to accommodate shortcut key references which accommodate many software packages. It was the heaviest of all the Macintosh keyboards and set the standard for many typists. It was sold separately from any Apple computer and retailed for US$163.\n\n=== Apple Keyboard II (M0487) ===\n[[File:Apple Keyboard II.jpg|thumb|Apple Keyboard II]]\n\nIntroduced and sold with the [[Macintosh Classic]] and [[Macintosh LC|LC]] in 1990, this keyboard was almost identical to the original ADB Keyboard, but included flip-down feet to change the typing angle and a design change that gave the frame and keys a more streamlined appearance. Internally, the M0487 differed from the original M0116, as the M0487 did not use mechanical keyswitches (save for the Caps Lock). In 1993, the [[Macintosh TV]], the first Mac introduced in all black, came with an identical black Keyboard II (using the same model number). This keyboard marked the return of Apple including a standard keyboard together with the computer itself.\n\n=== Apple Extended Keyboard II ===\n{{Main|Apple Extended Keyboard}}\n\nA minor update to the ''Apple Extended Keyboard'' to coincide with the release of the [[Macintosh IIsi]] in 1990, it added an adjustable height feature.\n\n* '''(M0312)''' was manufactured with the classic [[Alps Electric|Alps]] mechanisms\n* '''(M3501)''' was manufactured with Mitsumi or Alps mechanisms.\n\n=== Apple Adjustable Keyboard (M1242) ===\n{{Main|Apple Adjustable Keyboard}}\n[[File:Apple Adjustable Keyboard M1242 different views.jpeg|thumb|upright|Apple Adjustable Keyboard]]\n\nThe [[Apple Adjustable Keyboard]], which was sold as an optional upgrade, was Apple's 1993 entry into the ergonomic adjustable keyboard market. It was often criticized for its flimsy construction. It came with a separate keypad (not sold separately), the first to do so since the original [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]] keyboard.\n\n=== Newton Keyboard (X0044) ===\n[[File:Apple Newton Keyboard x0044 DE front.jpg|thumb|Keyboard for the Apple Newton, Model X0044, German keyboard layout]]\n\nIn the mid-1990s Apple released the [[Apple Newton]] sub-mini keyboard to allow a quick input alternative to the Newton's handwriting recognition, which required extensive training to become useful. It connected via the Newton's serial interface. Many Mac users favoring the portable size were able to use it on a Mac utilizing a third-party enabler. Like the [[iPhone#Text input|iPhone]] that would come 10 years later, the Newton also included a [[Apple Newton#User interface|virtual keyboard]].\n\n=== AppleDesign Keyboard (M2980) ===\n[[File:Apple Extended Keyboard II black.jpg|thumb|The black AppleDesign Keyboard]]\n\nThis was the first major redesign of the Apple keyboard, featuring more fluid, curving lines to match the look of the new Apple product style. It was an unpopular replacement for the ''Apple Extended Keyboard II'' in 1994. Significantly lighter than its predecessors, it had a much softer and quieter key interface that was unpopular with many typists. It also included only one ADB port for mice or other pointing devices, concealed on the underside, with the keyboard's cable permanently attached.<ref>[http://support.apple.com/kb/TA33931 Extended Keyboard II & AppleDesign Keyboard Differences<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Extended II had an ADB port on either side of the keyboard, allowing the keyboard cable or mouse to be attached to the side preferred by the user. This keyboard was also produced in black using the same model number (like the ''Apple Keyboard II'' for the [[Macintosh TV]]), for inclusion with the black [[Power Macintosh 5400|Performa 5420]] released primarily in Europe, and the black [[Power Macintosh 5500]] released in Asia.\n\n=== Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh Keyboard (M3459) ===\nBundled with the ''[[Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh]]'' in 1997, this keyboard once again excluded an integrated keypad, though unlike the ''Adjustable Keyboard'' none was offered. Based on a ''[[PowerBook]]'' form factor it also included an optional built-in [[trackpad]] and leather palm rests. This was the last ADB keyboard Apple would produce, and was not sold separately.\n\n=== Apple USB Keyboard (M2452) ===\n[[File:Apple USB Keyboard B.jpg|thumb|Apple USB Keyboard (Norwegian) (Bondi blue)]]\n\nReleased and sold with the [[iMac]] in 1998 this became the new standard for all Macintosh models for the next two years. It was the first to use translucent plastics, first in [[Bondi blue]], then in a darker gray called \"Graphite\" for the PowerMac G4 line and fruit-colored for each of the five first color variations of the iMac. It had a built-in retractable support leg. It also marked a return to the standard keyboard with integrated keypad with the enhanced cursor keys above the keypad. The keyboard had a power key on the top right side, and was the last keyboard to have the power key. This keyboard can be used with Windows (although the power key has no function).\n\n=== Apple Pro Keyboard (M7803) ===\n[[File:Apple Pro Keyboard black.jpg|thumb|Apple Pro Keyboard (German)]]\n\nOriginally introduced as the Apple Pro Keyboard in 2000, but discontinued three years later, this keyboard reintroduced the additional extended function keys last seen in the Apple Design Keyboard and debuted in a clear case with black keys. A version with white keys was introduced in 2002 alongside the [[iMac G4]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-imac-800mhz-powerpc-g4/|title=Apple iMac 800MHz PowerPC G4 Review|last=Steinberg|first=Gene|date=January 14, 2002|website=ZDNet|language=en|access-date=2019-02-09|quote=Apple dresses up the familiar Pro keyboard and Pro mouse in matching white.}}</ref> One major departure from all previous ADB and USB keyboards was the removal of the remote power key.

This revision also renamed the device as just the 'Apple Keyboard', thus dropping 'Pro' from the commercial name, {{Citation needed span|text=but the complete name 'Apple Pro Keyboard' is always used in internal technical information.|date=December 2018|reason=}} The A1048 was updated in 2005 with USB 2.0 ports replacing the USB 1.1 ports. The A1048 was available only in white until it was again redesigned in 2007.\n* {{Anchor|Aluminum w/ Numeric Keypad}}'''(A1243)''' The Apple Keyboard introduced in 2007, has a solid aluminum enclosure, as does the similarly styled [[Apple Wireless Keyboard]]. This same keyboard is also the first of Apple's keyboards in 27 years to omit the long-enduring Apple logo(s) denoting the [[Command key]]'s [[backward compatibility]] with the [[Apple key]] that was originally introduced on keyboards compatible with the [[Apple II series]] of computers. This convention, however, lasted much longer than Apple had intended because of how it was retained by all keyboards which used the [[Apple Desktop Bus]] connection standard that the company introduced with the release of the [[Apple IIGS]] even though software and official documentation had ''never'' acknowledged the existence of the [[Apple key]], even within the Apple II series of computers, and had always referred only to the key's other label, '\u2318.'  By the time that Apple discontinued the external use of [[Apple Desktop Bus|ADB]], the legacy practice of including the [[Apple key|Apple symbol]] on the [[Command key]] had stuck. This model of the Apple keyboard also has two down-stream USB 2.0 ports, one at each end of the keyboard (like M2452 and M7803). This model was renamed as the 'Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad' after the release of the A1242 model in March 2009. This model was discontinued on 5 June 2017 and was the last wired keyboard produced by Apple.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/05/apple-removes-wired-keyboard/|title=Apple removes wired keyboard with numeric keypad from its online store|date=2017-06-06|work=9to5Mac|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}</ref> It is worth noting that there are two versions of the A1243 keyboard (the MB110LL/A and MB110LL/B), that are distinguished by the icons on the F3 and F4 keys. This slight update took place in July 2011 on the release of [[OS X Lion]] and changed the label on the Expos\u00e9 key (F3) to Mission Control and changing the Dashboard key (F4) to a Launchpad key.\n* {{Anchor|Aluminum w/o Numeric Keypad)}}'''(A1242)''' Early 2009 iMac revisions shipped with a new version of the wired keyboard, which omitted the numeric pad, similar to its wireless counterpart. The full keyboard with numeric pad remained available as a build-to-order option for an extra charge, and could also be purchased separately. The A1242 was discontinued in December 2010.<ref>{{cite web |first=Katie |last=Marsal |date=December 2, 2010 |title=Apple discontinues compact wired keyboard, Hulu Plus claims strong start |url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/12/02/apple_discontinues_compact_wired_keyboard_hulu_plus_claims_strong_start.html |work=AppleInsider |accessdate=April 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Apple Wireless Keyboard ===\n{{Main|Apple Wireless Keyboard}}\n* '''(A1016)''' Introduced for the first time in 2003, it was based on the [[Bluetooth]] standard. It was essentially identical to the revised ''Apple Keyboard'' offered four months earlier. According to the Apple website, it is not compatible with [[iPad]]s, unlike later models.<ref>[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4112 iOS: Apple Wireless Keyboard compatibility]</ref>\n* '''(A1255)''' In 2007, an updated model clad in aluminum was released, which, like the MacBook's keyboard, eliminated the integrated numeric keypad and special keys. It takes three AA batteries, with the power button on the right-hand side of the keyboard opposite the battery opening.\n* '''(A1314)''' MC184LL/A On October 20, 2009, the aluminum model was updated so that only two AA batteries are needed instead of three; two changes occurred in the physical appearance: 1. the placement of the plastic window for the bluetooth transceiver, which moved from the right-hand side of the keyboard's bottom to the centre, and 2. the keyboard was a few millimeters wider in depth than the previous wireless keyboard. Like the [[Magic Mouse]] released on the same date, it requires [[Mac OS X 10.6]] or later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/Apple_Wireless_Keyboard_2009_UG.pdf|title=Apple Wireless Keyboard manual|date=2009|website=Manuals.Info.Apple.com|format=PDF}}</ref>\n* '''(A1314)''' MC184LL/B July 2011 Same as above, but updated for Lion.

Dozens of models have been released over time, including the [[Apple Extended Keyboard]]. Currently, Apple offers only three keyboards via [[Bluetooth]]: [[Magic Keyboard]] (silver only), and Magic Keyboard with [[numeric keypad|Numeric Keypad]] (silver or space gray). The space gray model is also included with the [[iMac Pro]].\n\nBoth share a similar look and feel, based on a very thin aluminum chassis and laptop-style low-profile keys, sitting much closer to the tabletop than traditional keyboard designs.\n\n== Layout ==\n[[File:Apple key.jpg|thumb|An old version Command key, bearing the Apple logo]]\n[[File:Option-key.jpg|thumb|An older version Option key]]\n[[File:Apple Modifier Keys.jpg|thumb|The modifier keys]]\n\nTo serve the functionality of the [[Macintosh operating systems]] (and because of historical differences), the Apple Keyboard's [[keyboard layout|layout]] differs somewhat from that of the ubiquitous [[IBM PC keyboard]], mainly in its [[modifier key|modifier]] and special keys. Some of these keys have unique symbols defined in the [[Unicode]] block [[Miscellaneous Technical]]. Features different from other keyboards include:\n\n* The ''[[Command key|Command]]'' key ([[\u2318]]), used in most Mac [[keyboard shortcut]]s. The key functions as a [[Meta key]] in [[Unix-like]] environments, and is equally equivalent to the [[Windows key]] in Windows environments, although in common applications it performs the same function as the Windows [[Control key]]. Compared to their equivalents on the standard IBM PC keyboard layout the Command key and the Option key are located in reverse order.\n** The \"open\" (hollow) and separate \"closed\" (solid) Apple logo keys on the [[Apple II]] series, served functions similar to that of the Command key. The open-Apple key was combined with the Command key on [[Apple Desktop Bus]] keyboards (which were used on both the Apple IIgs and several years of Macintosh models) where it remained after the Apple II line was discontinued.\n* The ''[[Option key|Option]]'' key ([[\u2325]]), for entering [[diacritic]]s and other special characters. Like the [[Shift key|Shift]] and [[Control key|Control]] keys, the Option key serves as a modifier for the Command key shortcuts, as well as being used to type many special characters. It serves the function of the solid-Apple key in Apple II applications. It functions as the [[Alt key]] in Unix and Windows environments. Compared to their equivalents on the standard IBM PC keyboard layout the Command key and the Option key are located in reverse order.\n* Full-sized desktop keyboards with a dedicated [[Numeric keypad|numpad]] have [[function key]]s that can range up to F15, F16, or F19.<ref>[https://images.apple.com/keyboard/images/gallery/wired_1_20070813.jpg Image of the keyboard layout of a full-sized aluminum Apple keyboard] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803113151/http://images.apple.com/keyboard/images/gallery/wired_1_20070813.jpg |date=August 3, 2012 }}</ref> F17-F19 keys were introduced with the aluminium USB keyboard.<ref>[http://www.electronista.com/articles/07/07/27/new.imac.keyboard/ New slimline iMac keyboard revealed?], Electronista</ref> Compact keyboards such as the bluetooth wireless aluminium keyboard and the built-in keyboards on all Intel-based Macintosh notebooks range from F1-F12 only, just like IBM PC keyboards.\n* A ''Clear'' key, instead of a [[Num Lock]] key, on models with full [[numeric keypad]]s, as these are dedicated to numeric input and not generally used for cursor control. In Unicode, the Clear key is represented by {{unichar|2327|X IN A RECTANGLE BOX}}, defined as \"clear key\".<ref>{{cite web| title = Miscellaneous Technical| url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2300.pdf| accessdate = April 7, 2013}}</ref>\n* An \"equals\" key ([[=]]) added to the numeric keypad.\n* A ''Help'' key, instead of an [[Insert key]], or on the most recent aluminum keyboards, a [[fn key]], which toggles the function of the [[function key]]s between their default functions and special functions (volume control, [[Mission Control (macOS)|Expos\u00e9]], etc.).\n* Notebook computers typically include additional assignments shared with function keys{{snd}}reduce and increase brightness, volume up, volume down, mute, and eject ([[\u23cf]]). Apple, since the release of the Pro Keyboard, provides these last four keys on desktop keyboards above the numeric keypad where status indicator lights are on many IBM PC keyboards. On the newest aluminum keyboard, these functions are accessed with the function keys, just like on the Apple laptops.\n* On [[Apple Desktop Bus]] keyboards, a [[power management keys|power key]] ([[\u25c1]]), used to turn on computers that supported it (and to type the Mac [[three-finger salute (computing)#Mac|three-finger salute]]). On keyboards with function keys, it was placed either on the left or right edge of the same keyboard row as the function keys; on keyboards without function keys it was placed in a central location above the other keys. The power key was replaced with a more conventional power button on early USB keyboards, thanks to a proprietary pin wired to the Macintosh's power supply in Apple's early USB implementations, subsequently eliminated on the Pro Keyboard along with the special power supply pin. Most of its functions were transferred to the eject (\u23cf) key in such later keyboards (holding down the control key simultaneously to make the eject key act like the power key).\n** On the Apple IIgs, this key, used in conjunction with the control key, is reset.  Used in conjunction with the open Apple key, reset reboots the computer.  Various other reset key combinations do various other things.\n* The Apple UK keyboard layout has the ''@'' and'' \" ''keys in their US locations (on the ''2'' and'' ' ''keys respectively). These are normally reversed on non-Apple UK keyboards.\n\n=== Usage of function keys ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! F1 !! F2 !! F3 !! F4 !! F5 !! F6 !! F7 !! F8 !! F9 !! F10 !! F11 !! F12\n|-\n!

These first keyboards had chocolate brown keycaps with white legends. The Apple II and Apple II+ keyboard had 52 keys, the Apple III keyboard, which included a numeric pad and some other additional keys, had 74. In 1983, the new Apple IIe and Apple III+ models introduced a beige keyboard with smaller black legends. In the same year, Apple introduced its first separate keyboard with the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]]; it incorporated a numeric keypad and lighter taupe-colored keycaps. It connected via a unique [[TRS connector|TRS]] port. The [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]] updated the look somewhat and separated the (optional) numerical keypad from the alphanumeric unit, all of which connected by telephone-style modular cables. By 1986, the [[Macintosh Plus]] re-integrated the numerical keypad and became the standard for all successive keyboards. However, it also marked the last of the beige Apple-II-era designs which were usurped by the newer [[Snow White design language]].\n\nFrom the end of 1986 until mid-1998, all new Apple keyboards were \"Platinum\" gray and connected via the [[Apple Desktop Bus]] (ADB). The Apple IIe and IIc line continued with integrated keyboards, as did the [[PowerBook]] portable line of course, those of the latter being a darker gray color called \"Smoke\". During the 90s, Apple offered various styles of keyboard, including the large [[Enhanced keyboard|extended keyboards]] which included the features of their [[IBM PC compatible|IBM PC AT]] counterparts.\n\nThe release of the [[iMac G3|first iMac]] in October 1998 introduced a matching compact, translucent-plastic keyboard based on laptop technology and marked the transition from ADB to [[USB]]. In July 2000, it was replaced with the full-sized Pro Keyboard, having slightly translucent black keys and a clear case. The PowerBook and [[iBook]] integrated keyboards followed suit with translucent keys first in bronze (PowerBook), then in black (PowerBook) and white (iBook). Coinciding with the introduction of the [[iMac G4]] in 2002, Apple started making its keyboards white. On the [[Bluetooth]] [[Apple Wireless Keyboard|Wireless Keyboard]], Apple removed the adjustable feet from the back of the keyboard, giving it a solid base. This design was later quietly introduced on the wired version. The [[AlBook|Aluminum PowerBooks]] added another color, opaque aluminum with sometimes-backlit translucent legends, to the array of keyboard styles in use.\n\n=== Current keyboards ===\nOn August 7, 2007, Apple introduced their current generation of keyboards. The new model is much thinner than its predecessors, requiring less wrist flexing and a slightly lower hand position for most users. Taking a cue from the portables, it has an aluminum enclosure, and the USB ports have been, once again, relocated to the right and left ends of the keyboard case. Software function and hardware control keys have a new arrangement, and there are keys associated with specific features of [[macOS]], such as [[Apple Dashboard (software)|Dashboard]]. In order to properly use these new features, a computer must be updated as of the initial ship date of the keyboards, usually with the built-in [[Apple Software Update|Software Update]].<ref>[https://www.apple.com/support/downloads/keyboardsoftwareupdate12.html Keyboard Software Update 1.2] ''Apple official support site'' Retrieved 2007-09-18<!--- If this ref dies: The \"12\" refers to the version number...try 13, 14, 20.... ---></ref>\n\nOn March 3, 2009, Apple introduced an additional keyboard to their latest line of keyboards. The new keyboard is similar to the wireless keyboard due to the absence of the numeric keypad, however it is a wired keyboard with 2 USB 2.0 ports similar to the standard keyboard. Until this time the typical keyboard with the numeric keypad was titled \"Apple Keyboard\", now the more-compact keyboard carries the name \"Apple Keyboard\" and the standard keyboard with numeric keys is titled \"Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad\".<ref>[http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB869?mco=NDE4Mzg3NA] Keyboard \u2013 Apple Store {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306142815/http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB869?mco=NDE4Mzg3NA|date=March 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Compatibility ==\n[[File:Mac lc keyboard port.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Apple Desktop Bus]] (ADB) connector]]\n\nApple's older ADB ([[Apple Desktop Bus]]) keyboards are compatible with other ADB-based systems, such as those from Next and Sony (and vice versa for their non-Apple ADB keyboards). When using a USB adapter (such as the Griffin iMate), they function similarly to Apple's later USB keyboards, although there can be problems using such setups with later versions of [[macOS]]. Although external ADB ports ceased to be used after the [[Power Macintosh G3 (Blue & White)]], Apple still used ADB as the internal protocol for their laptop keyboards and trackpads until the last-generation PowerBooks and iBooks; for this reason, ADB drivers can still be found in [[Mac OS X 10.5]] but not [[Mac OS X 10.6]]. Even with these operating systems, it is possible to use ADB devices with a USB adapter.\n\nApple's USB keyboards are mostly compatible with Windows computers, and can be remapped; the Command key works as the Windows key, the {{keypress|Option}} key as the Alt key, the [[Help key]] as the {{keypress|Insert}} key, and the {{keypress|Clear}} key as the {{keypress|Num Lock}} key. On the slightly older all-white models, the volume keys function as they would on a Macintosh, and the eject key has no function. With the new models released in August 2007 the volume, brightness, Expos\u00e9, dashboard, eject and media controls no longer work without installing Apple's Boot Camp software. This software allows for the volume, brightness, eject, and media controls buttons to work properly.\n\nThe additional function keys placed where the [[Print Screen]]/[[SysRq]], [[Scroll Lock]], and [[Break key|Pause/Break]] keys are on most IBM PC keyboards (F13/F14 through F15/F16) do not work as those keys in Windows without a special driver. Apple has since released a driver, though it is only available bundled with [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]].\n\nThe USB keyboard is also combined with a two-[[Computer port (hardware)|port]] USB [[USB hub|hub]], with the hub being [[USB 1.1]] on older keyboards and [[USB 2.0]] on the May 2003 Rev B. 2005 and August 2007 model.\n\n== Models ==\n=== Built-in keyboards ===\n[[File:Apple iieb.jpg|thumb|Apple IIe built-in keyboard]]\n\n* '''Apple II/II Plus''' \u2013 Introduced in 1977, the [[Apple II]] and [[Apple II Plus|II Plus]] came without a numeric keypad. There was also a black keyboard manufactured for a [[Bell & Howell]] edition.\n* '''Apple III/III Plus''' \u2013 Introduced in 1980, the [[Apple III]] and [[Apple III Plus|III Plus]] introduced a numeric keypad and special [[command key]]s.\n* '''Apple IIe/IIe Platinum''' \u2013 The [[Apple IIe]] series, introduced in 1983, once again eliminated the integrated numeric keypad, but offered an external one. However it did finally offer a \"delete\" key. In 1987 with the introduction of the Platinum IIe, the keypad was re-integrated and the keyboard was updated to conform to the newly released Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard.\n* '''Apple IIc/IIc Plus''' \u2013 Introduced in 1984, the [[Apple IIc]] was the first keyboard designed to be portable and lacked a keypad. In 1988 the keyboard changed color from beige to Platinum and was revised to match the layout of the Apple Desktop Bus keyboard, though still without provision for a keypad.\n* '''Macintosh Portable''' Apple's first truly portable computer, the [[Macintosh Portable]] released in 1989 had a full-sized Apple Keyboard with optional built-in numeric keypad or [[trackball]] mouse.\n* '''PowerBook''' \u2013 From 1991 to 2005, all of Apple's portable [[PowerBook]] computers have included a smaller keyboard in various colors and finishes, including dark gray, black, translucent bronze, charcoal, and an aluminum finish with backlighting. Along the way, they have also included special function keys and embedded keypads.\n* '''eMate''' \u2013 The dark green translucent keyboard of the [[eMate]] introduced in 1997, was essentially an [[Apple Newton]] keyboard.\n* '''iBook''' \u2013 In 1999, the [[iBook]] series introduced the first ever white keyboards. Debuting in a transparent finish, the later models were opaque.\n* '''MacBook/MacBook Pro/MacBook Air''' \u2013 In 2006, Apple introduced the [[MacBook]] series of computers. The [[MacBook Pro]] keyboard continued the aluminum treatment of the PowerBook line, while the MacBook remained white like the iBook before it and introduced a black model as well. The MacBook Air also used black keys. The introduction of the unibody MacBook series in 2009 saw a unification across all Apple keyboards to use black keys, the sole white keys remaining on the (now discontinued) [[MacBook#Polycarbonate model|white MacBook]].  Pre-unibody MacBook series keyboards included an overlaid numeric keypad like on the earlier PowerBook series and iBook series keyboards but Apple completely removed the numeric keypad from all unibody MacBook series keyboards.\n\n=== Apple Numeric Keypad IIe (A2M2003) ===\n[[File:Apple Numeric Keypad IIe.jpg|thumb|Apple Numeric Keypad IIe]]\n\nThe Numeric Keypad IIe was Apple's first external keypad. Released as an option specifically for the popular Apple IIe computer in 1983, it helped correct some of the II series' shortcomings. Later the Platinum IIe would incorporate the numeric keypad into its built-in keyboard.\n\n=== Lisa Keyboard (A6MB101) ===\nThe first keyboard not to be integrated into the [[CPU]] case like the Apple II and III series before it. It was designed for and came with the [[Apple Lisa]]. Like the Apple III before it, it was intended to be a business computer and included an integrated numeric keypad. Like all Apple computers before it, it came in a beige case to match the CPU and connected by a unique [[TRS connector]]. In addition it carried over the use of the \"open\" Apple key from the Apple III as a command key (though it was represented by the \"closed\" Apple character) and included a pullout reference guide hidden under the keyboard.\n\n=== Macintosh Keyboard (M0110) ===\n[[File:Apple Macintosh Plus Keyboard.jpg|thumb|Macintosh Keyboard]]\n\nIntroduced and included with the original Macintosh in 1984, it debuted with neither arrow keys to control the cursor nor an integrated numeric keypad. It used a telephone cord-style RJ-10 connector to the case (also used with the Amstrad PCW series of computers). The keyboard [[pinouts]] are \"crossed\" so it isn't possible to use a standard telephone cord as a replacement; doing so will result in damage to the keyboard or the computer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.networxsecurity.org/members-area/glossary/m/modular-connector.html|title=Modular Connector \u2013 4P4C \u2013 Data Port|website=Networx Security|access-date=2019-02-09|quote=The connector wiring, however, required a polarized straight through pinout. Using a telephone handset cable instead of the supplied cable could short out the +5 volt DC supply and damage the computer or the keyboard.}}</ref> The keyboard also introduced a unique command key similar to the \"open\" Apple Key on the Lisa.\n\n=== Macintosh Numeric Keypad (M0120) ===\nLike the Apple IIe before it, the Macintosh provided an optional external keypad which also included arrow keys that daisy chained to the CPU via the telephone-cord connectors. Though introduced with the Macintosh in January 1984, Apple did not ship it until September 1984 at a retail price of US$99.\n\n=== Macintosh Plus Keyboard (M0110A) ===\n[[File:Apple Macintosh Plus Extended Keyboard.jpg|thumb|The Macintosh Plus keyboard, like the original Macintosh Keyboard before it, used a coiled modular cable similar to a telephone handset cord.]]\n\nIntroduced and included with the Macintosh Plus in 1986, it was an extended keyboard that had a built-in numeric keypad. In 1987 it was updated to Apple's new Platinum gray color. It continued to use the telephone-cord style connector to the system and was interchangeable with the M0110. Though Apple switched all other keyboards to [[Apple Desktop Bus]] connectors by this time, this keyboard was manufactured unchanged for four more years until the Plus was discontinued in 1990.\n\n=== Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard (A9M0330) ===\n[[File:Apple IIgs Keyboard B.jpg|thumb|Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard]]\n\nThis was the first Apple keyboard to use the new [[Apple Desktop Bus]] (ADB) connector first seen on the [[Apple IIGS]]. Designed to be compatible with both the Macintosh and Apple product lines, it was the first to combine both the Macintosh command key and Apple II \"open\" Apple key legends. Entirely Platinum gray in color (later Macintosh Plus keyboards had a platinum gray case with darker gray keys called \"Smoke\"), it was also the first to use [[Snow White design language]] that was similar to the Apple IIc. However, it duplicated the extended design established by the Plus. It was also the first to include an external power/reset button and an extra ADB port.\n\n=== Apple Keyboard (M0116) ===\n[[File:Apple (Standard) Keyboard M0116.jpg|thumb|Apple (Standard) Keyboard]]\n\nAlso known as the ''Apple Standard Keyboard'', it was the first to officially use this name. Apple would later reuse the name for a series of successive keyboards. The ''Apple Keyboard'' was a more solid version of the ''Apple Desktop Bus Keyboard'' and optionally included with the [[Macintosh II]] and [[Macintosh SE|SE]] in 1987. The heftier design solidified visually the power performance embodied by the upgraded Macs. Aside from weight the main difference was the significantly thicker frame width. It was the first keyboard to be sold separately from the system, giving the customer a choice of the basic or advanced keyboards offered by Apple.\n\n===Apple Extended Keyboard (M0115) ===\n{{Main|Apple Extended Keyboard}}\n[[File:Apple Extended Keyboard.jpg|thumb|Apple Extended Keyboard II]]\n\nApple's advanced keyboard, the first to be sold optionally, was essentially a redesigned version of the ''Apple Keyboard,'' with an [[Enhanced keyboard|enhanced]] extended keyboard with [[Function key|FKeys]] and other [[IBM PC keyboard|PC-style keys]]. It included template guides above the top row of function keys to accommodate shortcut key references which accommodate many software packages. It was the heaviest of all the Macintosh keyboards and set the standard for many typists. It was sold separately from any Apple computer and retailed for US$163.\n\n=== Apple Keyboard II (M0487) ===\n[[File:Apple Keyboard II.jpg|thumb|Apple Keyboard II]]\n\nIntroduced and sold with the [[Macintosh Classic]] and [[Macintosh LC|LC]] in 1990, this keyboard was almost identical to the original ADB Keyboard, but included flip-down feet to change the typing angle and a design change that gave the frame and keys a more streamlined appearance. Internally, the M0487 differed from the original M0116, as the M0487 did not use mechanical keyswitches (save for the Caps Lock). In 1993, the [[Macintosh TV]], the first Mac introduced in all black, came with an identical black Keyboard II (using the same model number). This keyboard marked the return of Apple including a standard keyboard together with the computer itself.\n\n=== Apple Extended Keyboard II ===\n{{Main|Apple Extended Keyboard}}\n\nA minor update to the ''Apple Extended Keyboard'' to coincide with the release of the [[Macintosh IIsi]] in 1990, it added an adjustable height feature.\n\n* '''(M0312)''' was manufactured with the classic [[Alps Electric|Alps]] mechanisms\n* '''(M3501)''' was manufactured with Mitsumi or Alps mechanisms.\n\n=== Apple Adjustable Keyboard (M1242) ===\n{{Main|Apple Adjustable Keyboard}}\n[[File:Apple Adjustable Keyboard M1242 different views.jpeg|thumb|upright|Apple Adjustable Keyboard]]\n\nThe [[Apple Adjustable Keyboard]], which was sold as an optional upgrade, was Apple's 1993 entry into the ergonomic adjustable keyboard market. It was often criticized for its flimsy construction. It came with a separate keypad (not sold separately), the first to do so since the original [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]] keyboard.\n\n=== Newton Keyboard (X0044) ===\n[[File:Apple Newton Keyboard x0044 DE front.jpg|thumb|Keyboard for the Apple Newton, Model X0044, German keyboard layout]]\n\nIn the mid-90's Apple released the [[Apple Newton]] sub-mini keyboard to allow a quick input alternative to the Newton's handwriting recognition, which required extensive training to become useful. It connected via the Newton's serial interface. Many Mac users favoring the portable size were able to use it on a Mac utilizing a third-party enabler. Like the [[iPhone#Text input|iPhone]] that would come 10 years later, the Newton also included a [[Apple Newton#User interface|virtual keyboard]].\n\n=== AppleDesign Keyboard (M2980) ===\n[[File:Apple Extended Keyboard II black.jpg|thumb|The black AppleDesign Keyboard]]\n\nThis was the first major redesign of the Apple keyboard, featuring more fluid, curving lines to match the look of the new Apple product style. It was an unpopular replacement for the ''Apple Extended Keyboard II'' in 1994. Significantly lighter than its predecessors, it had a much softer and quieter key interface that was unpopular with many typists. It also included only one ADB port for mice or other pointing devices, concealed on the underside, with the keyboard's cable permanently attached.<ref>[http://support.apple.com/kb/TA33931 Extended Keyboard II & AppleDesign Keyboard Differences<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Extended II had an ADB port on either side of the keyboard, allowing the keyboard cable or mouse to be attached to the side preferred by the user. This keyboard was also produced in black using the same model number (like the ''Apple Keyboard II'' for the [[Macintosh TV]]), for inclusion with the black [[Power Macintosh 5400|Performa 5420]] released primarily in Europe, and the black [[Power Macintosh 5500]] released in Asia.\n\n=== Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh Keyboard (M3459) ===\nBundled with the ''[[Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh]]'' in 1997, this keyboard once again excluded an integrated keypad, though unlike the ''Adjustable Keyboard'' none was offered. Based on a ''[[PowerBook]]'' form factor it also included an optional built-in [[trackpad]] and leather palm rests. This was the last ADB keyboard Apple would produce, and was not sold separately.\n\n=== Apple USB Keyboard (M2452) ===\n[[File:Apple USB Keyboard B.jpg|thumb|Apple USB Keyboard (Norwegian) (Bondi blue)]]\n\nReleased and sold with the [[iMac]] in 1998 this became the new standard for all Macintosh models for the next two years. It was the first to use translucent plastics, first in [[Bondi blue]], then in a darker gray called \"Graphite\" for the PowerMac G4 line and fruit-colored for each of the five first color variations of the iMac. It had a built-in retractable support leg. It also marked a return to the standard keyboard with integrated keypad with the enhanced cursor keys above the keypad. The keyboard had a power key on the top right side, and was the last keyboard to have the power key. This keyboard can be used with Windows (although the power key has no function).\n\n=== Apple Pro Keyboard (M7803) ===\n[[File:Apple Pro Keyboard black.jpg|thumb|Apple Pro Keyboard (German)]]\n\nOriginally introduced as the Apple Pro Keyboard in 2000, but discontinued three years later, this keyboard reintroduced the additional extended function keys last seen in the Apple Design Keyboard and debuted in a clear case with black keys. A version with white keys was introduced in 2002 alongside the [[iMac G4]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-imac-800mhz-powerpc-g4/|title=Apple iMac 800MHz PowerPC G4 Review|last=Steinberg|first=Gene|date=January 14, 2002|website=ZDNet|language=en|access-date=2019-02-09|quote=Apple dresses up the familiar Pro keyboard and Pro mouse in matching white.}}</ref> One major departure from all previous ADB and USB keyboards was the removal of the remote power key. This keyboard contained 109 keys (ANSI), and retained the single folding leg on the bottom.\n\n===Apple Keyboard (109 and 78 keys)===\n[[File:Apple Keyboard (A1048).jpg|thumb|Apple Keyboard (US) (A1048)]]\n[[File:Apple Pro Keyboard (open top).jpg|thumb|Apple Keyboard (German) (A1048)]]\n[[File:Apple iMac Keyboard A1243.png|thumb|Apple Keyboard (A1243)]]\n\n* '''(A1048)''' In May 2003, the keyboard underwent a major redesign which eliminated the frame enclosing the keys while adding an F16 key and moving the USB ports to the back.  This revision also renamed the device as just the 'Apple Keyboard', thus dropping 'Pro' from the commercial name, {{Citation needed span|text=but the complete name 'Apple Pro Keyboard' is always used in internal technical information.|date=December 2018|reason=}} The A1048 was updated in 2005 with USB 2.0 ports replacing the USB 1.1 ports. The A1048 was available only in white until it was again redesigned in 2007.\n* {{Anchor|Aluminum w/ Numeric Keypad}}'''(A1243)''' The Apple Keyboard introduced in 2007, has a solid aluminum enclosure, as does the similarly styled [[Apple Wireless Keyboard]]. This same keyboard is also the first of Apple's keyboards in 27 years to omit the long-enduring Apple logo(s) denoting the [[Command key]]'s [[backward compatibility]] with the [[Apple key]] that was originally introduced on keyboards compatible with the [[Apple II series]] of computers. This convention, however, lasted much longer than Apple had intended because of how it was retained by all keyboards which used the [[Apple Desktop Bus]] connection standard that the company introduced with the release of the [[Apple IIGS]] even though software and official documentation had ''never'' acknowledged the existence of the [[Apple key]], even within the Apple II series of computers, and had always referred only to the key's other label, '\u2318.'  By the time that Apple discontinued the external use of [[Apple Desktop Bus|ADB]], the legacy practice of including the [[Apple key|Apple symbol]] on the [[Command key]] had stuck. This model of the Apple keyboard also has two down-stream USB 2.0 ports, one at each end of the keyboard (like M2452 and M7803). This model was renamed as the 'Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad' after the release of the A1242 model in March 2009. This model was discontinued on 5 June 2017 and was the last wired keyboard produced by Apple.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/05/apple-removes-wired-keyboard/|title=Apple removes wired keyboard with numeric keypad from its online store|date=2017-06-06|work=9to5Mac|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en-US}}</ref> It is worth noting that there are two versions of the A1243 keyboard (the MB110LL/A and MB110LL/B), that are distinguished by the icons on the F3 and F4 keys. This slight update took place in July 2011 on the release of [[OS X Lion]] and changed the label on the Expos\u00e9 key (F3) to Mission Control and changing the Dashboard key (F4) to a Launchpad key.\n* {{Anchor|Aluminum w/o Numeric Keypad)}}'''(A1242)''' Early 2009 iMac revisions shipped with a new version of the wired keyboard, which omitted the numeric pad, similar to its wireless counterpart. The full keyboard with numeric pad remained available as a build-to-order option for an extra charge, and could also be purchased separately. The A1242 was discontinued in December 2010.<ref>{{cite web |first=Katie |last=Marsal |date=December 2, 2010 |title=Apple discontinues compact wired keyboard, Hulu Plus claims strong start |url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/12/02/apple_discontinues_compact_wired_keyboard_hulu_plus_claims_strong_start.html |work=AppleInsider |accessdate=April 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Apple Wireless Keyboard ===\n{{Main|Apple Wireless Keyboard}}\n* '''(A1016)''' Introduced for the first time in 2003, it was based on the [[Bluetooth]] standard. It was essentially identical to the revised ''Apple Keyboard'' offered four months earlier. According to the Apple website, it is not compatible with [[iPad]]s, unlike later models.<ref>[http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4112 iOS: Apple Wireless Keyboard compatibility]</ref>\n* '''(A1255)''' In 2007, an updated model clad in aluminum was released, which, like the MacBook's keyboard, eliminated the integrated numeric keypad and special keys. It takes three AA batteries, with the power button on the right-hand side of the keyboard opposite the battery opening.\n* '''(A1314)''' MC184LL/A On October 20, 2009, the aluminum model was updated so that only two AA batteries are needed instead of three; two changes occurred in the physical appearance: 1. the placement of the plastic window for the bluetooth transceiver, which moved from the right-hand side of the keyboard's bottom to the centre, and 2. the keyboard was a few millimeters wider in depth than the previous wireless keyboard. Like the [[Magic Mouse]] released on the same date, it requires [[Mac OS X 10.6]] or later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/Apple_Wireless_Keyboard_2009_UG.pdf|title=Apple Wireless Keyboard manual|date=2009|website=Manuals.Info.Apple.com|format=PDF}}</ref>\n* '''(A1314)''' MC184LL/B July 2011 Same as above, but updated for Lion.
