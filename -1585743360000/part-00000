Other wall hangings were designed to be sold off the shelf of the new Morris and Company shop on [[Oxford Street]] which owned in 1877.   Later, he and his daughter May made designs for panels for \"embroider yourself\" kits for cushion covers, fireplace screens, doorway curtains, bedcovers and other household objects.  In 1885, Morris turned production of embroidery entirely over to his daughter. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/willam-morris-textiles|title=William Morris and textile design - Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Daisy wall hangings, designed by William Morris for Red House, worked by William and Jane Morris, 1860, couched wools on wool serge - Kelmscott Manor - Oxfordshire, England - DSC09983.jpg|Daisy wall hanging by William and Jane Morris for [[Kelmscott Manor]] (1860)\nFile:Panel of floral embroidery MET 61DCAT23R9.jpg|Panel of floral embroidery, silk on silk (c. 1875) (Metropolitan Museum of Art)\nFile:Art Needlework Morris Design Detail.jpg|Detail of silk on linen embroidery for a pillowcase or fireplace screen by William Morris (1878)\nFile:Embroidered Panel Morris and Company.jpg|Embroidered wall hanging \"Artichoke\", wool on linen (1890)\nFile:Morris & COMPANY, London - Acanthus porti\u00e8re - Google Art Project.jpg|\"Acanthus\" door curtain, Morris and Company, silk on linen (1890s) ([[Art Gallery of South Australia]])\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Furnishing textiles and woven fabrics==\nIn the late 1860s Morris began to experiment with a genre, textiles for furnishing or upholstery.

The workshops were next to the Wardle River, providing a source of abundant clean water, and also had a grassy meadow where dyed clothes could be dried in the open air.

Morris and his assistant John Smith made a series of experiments with [[indigo]] and other natural dyes,  but were unable to attain colours that satisfied Morris.  In 1875, Morris tried working with a commercia printer, Wardle and Company, using wood blocks with a reduced number of colours and modern chemical dyes, This time he was dissatisfied with the lack of quality control by the workers, and the uneven results.  He therefore decided to establish his own workshop, where he could control everything.{{Sfn|Fiell (2017)|page=73}}\n\nHe moved his printing workshop to [[Merton Abbey Mills]], near the Merton Abbey Priory.  For printed textiles, the design was traced onto a block of pear wood, and then the wood was sculpted  so only the desired surface would touch the fabric. Thin strips of brass were pounded edge-first into the block to make the fine lines.  One block was used for each colour of the final fabric, The block was inked by placing into a vat of colorant, and then carefully placed onto the fabric on the table in front of the craftsman. He pounded it with a mallet to impress the colour, then he lifted the block  carefully, moved the fabric, re-inked the block, and printed the next section with the same colour.  When the first colour was finished, the finished fabric was set aside to dry.  If more than one colour was used, once the fabric was dry, a block with the next colour would be inked and carefully impressed over the image left by the first.   The same process and the same blocks could be used for making both fabrics and wallpaper.  Since fifteen or more colours might be used, It was an extremely laborious and long  process, sometimes lasting several weeks, and the cost was higher than that of mechanical printing methods. {{Sfn|Fiell|(2017)|page=74-75}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:A Wooden Pattern for Textile Printing from William Morris's Company.jpg|Wooden block for textile printing used by Morris Company\nFile:Morris and Company Textile Printing Merton Abbey.jpg|Textiles printed by hand at Merton Abbey (1890).  Carts ran on a track behind the craftsmen, bringing them vats of fresh colours. \n</gallery>\n\n==Tapestries==\nMorris wrote that making tapestries was 'the noblest of all the weaving arts', and most suitable for his interest in reviving medieval arts and crafts. He set up his first tapestry loom in 1877, and made completed his first tapestry, was 'Acanthus and Vine' in (1879).  He wove the tapestry himself, often getting up at dawn to work on a loom in his bedroom at [[Kelmscott House]].  His design was modelled  after the \"large leaf\" tapestries woven in France and Flanders in the 16th century, and he deliberately gave them a faded appearance to make them look two centuries old. He recorded that it took him five hundred sixteen and one half hours to complete. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/willam-morris-textiles|title=William Morris and textile design - Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOnce he had mastered the technique, he created a full-time tapestry workshop at the Morris and Company house on Queen Square. For most of his tapestries, Morris worked with other artists, particularly [[Edward Burne-Jones]], who designed the figures, Philip Webb, who designed birds and animals, and with his primary assistant and successor as chief designer,  [[John Henry Dearle]].{{Sfn|Fiell|2019|Pages=88-82}} Burne-Jones made a drawing of the figures first, which was transformed into a color design by Morris or Dearle.  A photographic image was made of he design with figures, to which Morris or Dearle added a floral background, and a border equally filled with designs of trees and flowers. The full scale image was transferred onto cloth  by rubbing with a piece of ivory, and then woven on a loom.  Large-scale tapestries were made in this way at Merton, mostly by the employment of boys ages thirteen and fourteen, who received shelter, board and a daily wage.{{Sfn|Fiell|2017|Pages=80-82}}\n\nThe most famous tapestries made by Burns-Jones and Morris were [[Holy Grail tapestries]] made for  [[William Knox D'Arcy]] in 1890 for his dining room at Stanmore Hall <ref>Parry (1983), pp. 116\u201317</ref> Additional versions of the tapestries with minor variations were woven on commission by Morris & Co. over the next decade.\n\nIn addition to full-scale tapestries, the Merton Abbey workshop produced smaller works, designed as coverings for cushions and furniture. Multiple copies were made of some popular tapestries.  Ten copies were made of  ''The Adoration'' between 1890 and 1907.  {{Sfn|Fiell|2017|Pages=80-82}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Morris Woodpecker tapestry detail.jpg|Woodpecker tapestry detail (1885)\nFile:Adoration of the Magi Tapestry cartoon.png|Cartoon of the Adoration of th Magi with figures by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] on photographic paper\nFile:Edward Burne-Jones - The Adoration of the Magi - Google Art Project.jpg|Completed ''Adoration of the Magi'', figures by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], decoration by Morris and J.H.

He decided to diverify the products by adding carpets, a market that was almost totally dominated by original or imitation oriental carpets.  Within three months, he had registered his first design for the Cataline floor cloth, a decorative covering for [[linoleum]] floors, a material which had been invented in 1855.  By December had registered two designs for machine-woven carpets which he had maded by the Wilton Royal Carpet Factory. {{Sfn|Fiell|2017|page=84}}\n\nAs usual, Morris set a high goal for himself.  His aim, he declared, was to make England independent of the Orient for the provision of hand-make carpets which aspire to the status of art.  He made a careful study of techniques and materials, and made a series of experiments.  When he moved to [[Kelmscott House]] in 1879 he began  to produce a series of carpets called Hammersmith.  He hired a labor force of young women to work on looms he  set up in the former stables and garage of  his London residence.  He also revived the art of hand-knotting for making small carpets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/willam-morris-textiles|title=William Morris and textile design - Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn the 1880s, in addition to the Hammersmith carpets, Morris created series of designs for machine-made [[Axminster]] and Kidderminister carpets, made at he Wilton factory or at [[Heckmondwike]] Manufacturing company in [[Yorkshire]].  Many of the carpets he designed used the patterns he had invented for  printed fabrics, but others, particularly the Hammersmith carpets, resembled the designs he made for his woven textiles. His early carpets sometimes borrowed popular oriental motifs.   The designs he made for Axminister and Wilton carpets were less lavish in their ornament and more geometrical, to make them more affordable.{{Sfn|Fiell|2017|Pages=80-82}}  \n\nIn 1881 he moved the workshop to Merton Abbey, where there was space to weave much larger carpets commissioned by his clients.  His designs for these large Hammersmith carpets moved farther away from the Oriental influence, and took on a more specifically English style.  As with his wallpapers other textiles,  his inspirations were most often flowers, plants and animals found in English gardens. {{Sfn|Fiell|2017|Pages=80-86}}\n\nOne particularly notable design was the Bullerswood carpet, was made in 1889 for the wool trader John Sanderson, who had a country residence called Bullerswood in [[Chislehurst]], [[Kent]]. Morris made two versions of the carpet for the house, in collaboration with his assistant [[John Henry Dearle]]. Extremely complex, they were virtual anthologies of all of the motifs of Morris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/willam-morris-textiles|title=William Morris and textile design - Victoria and Albert Museum}}</ref> Morris made one carpet for the living room and another for the front hallway. He also strictly supervised the decoration of these rooms, so it would be in harmony with the carpet. {{Sfn|Beecroft (2019)|page=300}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Morris Redcar carpet design c 1881-85.jpg|Redcar carpet design by Morris (1881-85)\nFile:Morris Holland Park carpet detail 1883.jpg|Holland Park carpet detail (1883)\nFile:Morris Bullerswood carpet detail c 1889.jpg|Bullerswood Carpet detail (1889)\nFile:Morris Little Flower carpet design detail.jpg|Watercolour design by Morris for the Little Flower carpet  \n</gallery>\n\n==The William Morris style==\nMorris explained his ideas about textile designs  in a group of essays by members of the Arts and Crafts movement published in 1893.  In his essay on textiles, Morris wrote: \"The aim should be to combine clearness of form and firmness of structure with the mystery which comes of abundance and richness of detail...Do not introduce any lines or objects which cannot be explained by the structure of the pattern; it is just this logical sequence of form, this growth which looks as if, under the circumstances, it could not have been otherwise, which prevents he eye wearying of he repetition of the pattern.<ref>''Arts and Crafts Essays'', by William Morris, Walter Crane, et al. (1893). Published on-line by Project Gutenberg</ref> \n\n\"...Do not be afraid of large patterns; if properly designed they are more restful to the eye than small ones...Very small rooms, as well as very large ones, look best ornamented with large patterns.\"\n\n\"...As final maxims, never forget the material you are working with, and try always to use it for doing what it can do best: if you feel yourself hampered by the material in which you are working, instead of being helped by it, you have so far not learned your business, any more than a would-be poet has, who complains of the hardship of writing in measure and rhyme.\" <ref>''Arts and Crafts Essays'', by William Morris, Walter Crane, et al. (1893). Published on-line by Project Gutenberg</ref>\n\nIn the same group of 1893 essays, he expressed his views of tapestry designs. He wrote:  \"As in all wall decoration, the first thing to be considered in designing of Tapestry is the force, purity and elegance of the silhouette of the objects represented, and nothing vague or indeterminate is admissible. But special excellencies can be expected from it.  Depth of tone, richness of colour, and exquisite gradation of tints are easily to be obtained in Tapestry; and it also demands that crispness and abundance of beautiful detail which was the especial characteristic of fully developed Medieval Art.  The style of even the best period of the Renaissance is wholly unfit for Tapestry; accordingly, we find that Tapestry retained its Gothic character longer than any other of the pictorial arts.\" {{Sfn|Beecroft (2019)|page=336}}\n\nIn writing about textiles, Morris emphasised the importance of using natural dyes and colours. \"These colours in fading still remain beautiful,\"  he wrote, \"and even after long wear, never pass into nothingness, through that stage which of livid ugliness which distinguishes the commercial dyes as nuisances, even more than their short and by no means merry life.\" <ref>''Of dyeing as an Art'' in ''Arts and Crafts Essays'', by William Morris, Walter Crane, et al. (1893). Published on-line by Project Gutenberg</ref>\n\nAs to colours for carpets, he wrote in his essay on textiles;  \"The soft gradations of tint to which Tapestry lends itself are unfit for Carpet-weaving; beauty and variety of colour must be obtained bh harmonious juxtaposition of tints, bounded by judiciously chosen outlines, and the pattern should lie absolutely flat on the ground. On the whole, in designing carpets the method of '''contrast''' should is the best one to employ, and blue and red, quit frankly used, with white or very light outlines on a dark ground, and black or some very dark colour on a light ground, are the main colours on which the designer should depend.\" <ref>''Textiles'' in ''Arts and Crafts Essays'', by William Morris, Walter Crane, et al.

In 1875, Morris tried working with a commercia printer, Wardle and Company, using wood blocks with a reduced number of colours and modern chemical dyes, This time he was dissatisfied with the lack of quality control by the workers, and the uneven results.  He therefore decided to establish his own workshop, where he could control everything.{{Sfn|Fiell (2017)|page=73}}\n\nHe moved his printing workshop to [[Merton Abbey Mills]], near the Merton Abbey Priory.  For printed textiles, the design was traced onto a block of pear wood, and then the wood was sculpted  so only the desired surface would touch the fabric. Thin strips of brass were pounded edge-first into the block to make the fine lines.  One block was used for each colour of the final fabric, The block was inked by placing into a vat of colorant, and then carefully placed onto the fabric on the table in front of the craftsman. He pounded it with a mallet to impress the colour, then he lifted the block  carefully, moved the fabric, re-inked the block, and printed the next section with the same colour.  When the first colour was finished, the finished fabric was set aside to dry.  If more than one colour was used, once the fabric was dry, a block with the next colour would be inked and carefully impressed over the image left by the first.   The same process and the same blocks could be used for making both fabrics and wallpaper.  Since fifteen or more colours might be used, It was an extremely laborious and long  process, sometimes lasting several weeks, and the cost was higher than that of mechanical printing methods. {{Sfn|Fiell|(2017)|page=74-75}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:A Wooden Pattern for Textile Printing from William Morris's Company.jpg|Wooden block for textile printing used by Morris Company\nFile:Morris and Company Textile Printing Merton Abbey.jpg|Textiles printed by hand at Merton Abbey (1890).  Carts ran on a track behind the craftsmen, bringing them vats of fresh colours. \n</gallery>\n\n==Tapestries==\nMorris wrote that making tapestries was 'the noblest of all the weaving arts', and most suitable for his interest in reviving medieval arts and crafts. He set up his first tapestry loom in 1877, and made completed his first tapestry, was 'Acanthus and Vine' in (1879).  He wove the tapestry himself, often getting up at dawn to work on a loom in his bedroom at [[Kelmscott House]].  His design was modelled  after the \"large leaf\" tapestries woven in France and Flanders iin the 16th century, and he deliberately gave them a faded appearance to make them look two centuries old. He recorded that it took him five hundred sixteen and one half hours to complete. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/willam-morris-textiles|title=William Morris and textile design - Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOnce he had mastered the technique, he created a full-time tapestry workshop at the Morris and Company house on Queen Square. For most of his tapestries, Morris worked with other artists, particularly [[Edward Burne-Jones]], who designed the figures, Philip Webb, who designed birds and animals, and with his primary assistant and successor as chief designer,  [[John Henry Dearle]].{{Sfn|Fiell|2019|Pages=88-82}} Burne-Jones made a drawing of the figures first, which was transformed into a color design by Morris or Dearle.  A photographic image was made of he design with figures, to which Morris or Dearle added a floral background, and a border equally filled with designs of trees and flowers. The full scale image was transferred onto cloth  by rubbing with a piece of ivory, and then woven on a loom.  Large-scale tapestries were made in this way at Merton, mostly by the employment of boys ages thirteen and fourteen, who received shelter, board and a daily wage.{{Sfn|Fiell|2017|Pages=80-82}}\n\nThe most famous tapestries made by Burns-Jones and Morris were [[Holy Grail tapestries]] made for  [[William Knox D'Arcy]] in 1890 for his dining room at Stanmore Hall <ref>Parry (1983), pp. 116\u201317</ref> Additional versions of the tapestries with minor variations were woven on commission by Morris & Co. over the next decade.\n\nIn addition to full-scale tapestries, the Merton Abbey workshop produced smaller works, designed as coverings for cushions and furniture. Multiple copies were made of some popular tapestries.  Ten copies were made of  ''The Adoration'' between 1890 and 1907.  {{Sfn|Fiell|2017|Pages=80-82}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Morris Woodpecker tapestry detail.jpg|Woodpecker tapestry detail (1885)\nFile:Adoration of the Magi Tapestry cartoon.png|Cartoon of the Adoration of th Magi with figures by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] on photographic paper\nFile:Edward Burne-Jones - The Adoration of the Magi - Google Art Project.jpg|Completed ''Adoration of the Magi'', figures by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], decoration by Morris and J.H.

He decided to diverify the products by adding carpets, a market that was almost totally dominated by original or imitation oriental carpets.  Within three months, he had registered his first design for the Cataline floor cloth, a decorative covering for [[linoleum]] floors, a material which had been invented in 1855.  By December had registered two designs for machine-woven carpets which he had maded by the Wilton Royal Carpet Factory. {{Sfn|Fiell|2017|page=84}}\n\nAs usual, Morris set a high goal for himself.  His aim, he declared, was to make England independent of the Orient for the provision of hand-make carpets which aspire to the status of art.  He made a careful study of techniques and materials, and made a series of experiments.  When he moved to [[Kelmscott House]] in 1879 he began  to produce a series of carpets called Hammersmith.  He hired a labor force of young women to work on looms he  set up in the former stables and garage of  his London residence.  He also revived the art of hand-knotting for making small carpets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/willam-morris-textiles|title=William Morris and textile design - Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn the 1880s, in addition to the Hammersmith carpets, Morris created series of designs for machine-made [[Axminster]] and Kidderminister carpets, made at he Wilton factory or at [[Heckmondwike]] Manufacturing company in [[Yorkshire]].  Many of the carpets he designed used the patterns he had invented for  printed fabrics, but others, particularly the Hammersmith carpets, resembled the designs he made for his woven textiles. His early carpets sometimes borrowed popular oriental motifs.   The designs he made for Axminister and Wilton carpets were less lavish in their ornament and more geometrical, to make them more affordable.{{Sfn|Fiell|2017|Pages=80-82}}  \n\nIn 1881 he moved the workshop to Merton Abbey, where there was space to weave much larger carpets commissioned by his clients.  His designs for these large Hammersmith carpets moved farther away from the Oriental influence, and took on a more specifically English style.  As with his wallpapers other textiles,  his inspirations were most often flowers, plants and animals found in English gardens. {{Sfn|Fiell|2017|Pages=80-86}}\n\nOne particularly notable design was the Bullerswood carpet, was made in 1889 for the wool trader John Sanderson, who had a country residence called Bullerswood in [[Chislehurst]], [[Kent]]. Morris made two versions of the carpet for the house, in collaboration with his assistant [[John Henry Dearle]]. Extremely complex, they were virtual anthologies of all of the motifs of Morris.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/willam-morris-textiles|title=William Morris and textile design - Victoria and Albert Museum}}</ref> Morris made one carpet for the living room and another for the front hallway. He also strictly supervised the decoration of these rooms, so it would be in harmony with the carpet. {{Sfn|Beecroft (2019)|page=300}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Morris Redcar carpet design c 1881-85.jpg|Redcar carpet design by Morris (1881-85)\nFile:Morris Holland Park carpet detail 1883.jpg|Holland Park carpet detail (1883)\nFile:Morris Bullerswood carpet detail c 1889.jpg|Bullerswood Carpet detail (1889)\nFile:Morris Little Flower carpet design detail.jpg|Watercolour design by Morris for the Little Flower carpet  \n</gallery>\n\n==The William Morris style==\nMorris explained his ideas about textile designs  in a group of essays by members of the Arts and Crafts movement published in 1893.  In his essay on textiles, Morris wrote: \"The aim should be to combine clearness of form and firmness of structure with the mystery which comes of abundance and richness of detail...Do not introduce any lines or objects which cannot be explained by the structure of the pattern; it is just this logical sequence of form, this growth which looks as if, under the circumstances, it could not have been otherwise, which prevents he eye wearying of he repetition of the pattern.<ref>''Arts and Crafts Essays'', by William Morris, Walter Crane, et al. (1893). Published on-line by Project Gutenberg</ref> \n\n\"...Do not be afraid of large patterns; if properly designed they are more restful to the eye than small ones...Very small rooms, as well as very large ones, look best ornamented with large patterns.\"\n\n\"...As final maxims, never forget the material you are working with, and try always to use it for doing what it can do best: if you feel yourself hampered by the material in which you are working, instead of being helped by it, you have so far not learned your business, any more than a would-be poet has, who complains of the hardship of writing in measure and rhyme.\" <ref>''Arts and Crafts Essays'', by William Morris, Walter Crane, et al. (1893). Published on-line by Project Gutenberg</ref>\n\nIn the same group of 1893 essays, he expressed his views of tapestry designs. He wrote:  \"As in all wall decoration, the first thing to be considered in designing of Tapestry is the force, purity and elegance of the silhouette of the objects represented, and nothing vague or indeterminate is admissible. But special excellencies can be can be expected from it.  Depth of tone, richness of colour, and exquisite gradation of tints are easily to be obtained in Tapestry; and it also demands that crispness and abundance of beautiful detail which was the especial characteristic of fully developed Medieval Art.  The style of even the best period of the Renaissance is wholly unfit for Tapestry; accordingly, we find that Tapestry retained its Gothic character longer than any other of the pictorial arts.\" {{Sfn|Beecroft (2019)|page=336}}\n\nIn writing about textiles, Morris emphasised the importance of using natural dyes and colours. \"These colours in fading still remain beautiful,\"  he wrote, \"and even after long wear, never pass into nothingness, through that stage which of livid ugliness which distinguishes the commercial dyes as nuisances, even more than their short and by no means merry life.\" <ref>''Of dyeing as an Art'' in ''Arts and Crafts Essays'', by William Morris, Walter Crane, et al. (1893). Published on-line by Project Gutenberg</ref>\n\nAs to colours for carpets, he wrote in his essay on textiles;  \"The soft gradations of tint to which Tapestry lends itself are unfit for Carpet-weaving; beauty and variety of colour must be obtained bh harmonious juxtaposition of tints, bounded by judiciously chosen outlines, and the pattern should lie absolutely flat on the ground. On the whole, in designing carpets the method of '''contrast''' should is the best one to employ, and blue and red, quit frankly used, with white or very light outlines on a dark ground, and black or some very dark colour on a light ground, are the main colours on which the designer should depend.\" <ref>''Textiles'' in ''Arts and Crafts Essays'', by William Morris, Walter Crane, et al.

The firm was finally dissolved in 1940, but his designs continue to be produced and marketed by other textile firms, including [[Sanderson and Sons]], part of the [[Walker Greenbank]] wallpaper and fabrics business, which now owns the. \"Morris and Co.\" brand name, and by the department store [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty of London]].\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Morris Tapestry Summer.jpg|Detail of the ''Summer'' Tapestry, jointly designed by Morris and [[John Henry Dearle]] (1890).\nFile:Embroidered Screen J H Dearle.jpg|Embroidered screen by [[John Henry Dearle]] (1910), with panels of canvas embroidered with silks in darning, stem and satin stitch.

In 1980, [[Casio]] used the latter track as part of a TV advertising campaign for its digital calculators, latching on to the phrase \"Such a digital lifetime\" used in one of the verses.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nTouring the UK in 1980, New Musik performed at May Balls in both [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] with [[Elvis Costello]]; and the Rotterdam New Pop 1980 [[music festival|festival]] in the Netherlands. In 1981, the band played a second UK tour and were featured in a 1981 [[documentary film]], ''Listen to London'', performing \"Straight Lines\" and \"This World of Water\".\n\nThe band's second album, ''[[Anywhere (New Musik album)|Anywhere]]'', was released in 1981 and reached No.&nbsp;68 in the UK.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> The album's single releases, \"Luxury\" and \"While You Wait\", did not chart. The band performed \"Luxury\" on ''[[Multi-Coloured Swap Shop]]''. In 1981, a compilation album, ''[[Sanctuary (compilation)|Sanctuary]]'', was released exclusively in the United States, consisting of five tracks from ''From A to B'' and seven from ''Anywhere''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Previous to this release, there had also been a four-song [[Gramophone record|10\" vinyl]] \"Straight Lines\" released by [[Sony Music|CBS Records]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] as part of their short-lived [[Epic Records|Epic]] 'Nu-Disk' series, which also included [[The Clash]]'s, ''[[Super Black Market Clash|Black Market Clash]]''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Towner and Hibbert departed, and Mansfield and Gates cut the next album with the assistance of studio musicians.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nAfter the demise of GTO Records, the band released their third and final album, ''[[Warp (album)|Warp]]'', in 1982 which was more experimental than their previous releases. ''Warp'' was almost entirely [[Electronic music|electronic]], and one of the first albums to be recorded primarily with [[digital recording|digital]] [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]s and [[E-mu Emulator|emulator]]s.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> It featured a [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] version of [[The Beatles]]' hit song \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\", alongside an identically titled track of their own.

achieved success in 1980 with the top 20 single \"[[Living by Numbers]]\" which was followed up with the top 40 hits \"This World of Water\", \"Sanctuary\" and hit album ''[[From A to B (New Musik album)|From A to B]]''.\n\n==History==\nNew Musik formed in 1977 in London, growing out of a casual band of South London school friends who [[Jam session|jammed]] together under the name End of the World.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> The lead [[singing|vocalist]] and [[frontman]] for the band was [[songwriter]] and [[record producer]] [[Tony Mansfield]], who was also a former member of the [[Nick Straker Band]], and was joined in the original line-up by Straker, [[bassist]] [[Tony Hibbert (musician)|Tony Hibbert]] and [[drummer]] Phil Towner.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>  The latter had played on [[The Buggles]]' [[hit single]], \"[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nTheir first single, \"Straight Lines\", was released by [[GTO Records]] in 1979, and their debut album, ''[[From A to B (New Musik album)|From A to B]]'', came out in April 1980. Straker left the band to pursue a [[solo (music)|solo]] career and was replaced by Clive Gates for the album.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nNew Musik made their first appearance on the [[BBC TV]] [[Pop music|pop]] programme ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in October 1979 with their debut \"Straight Lines\", which received [[airplay (radio)|airplay]] on [[BBC Radio 1]] from guest [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[Frank Zappa]], and also on [[WPIX-FM]] in [[New York City|New York]].{{cn|date=May 2017}} ''From A to B'' reached the [[Top 40]] in the [[UK Albums Chart]],<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> and contained four hit singles: \"Straight Lines\", \"This World of Water\", \"Sanctuary\" and their most commercially successful single \"Living by Numbers\". In 1980, [[Casio]] used the latter track as part of a TV advertising campaign for its digital calculators, latching on to the phrase \"Such a digital lifetime\" used in one of the verses.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nTouring the UK in 1980, New Musik performed at May Balls in both [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] with [[Elvis Costello]]; and the Rotterdam New Pop 1980 [[music festival|festival]] in the Netherlands. In 1981, the band played a second UK tour and were featured in a 1981 [[documentary film]], ''Listen to London'', performing \"Straight Lines\" and \"This World of Water\".\n\nThe band's second album, ''[[Anywhere (New Musik album)|Anywhere]]'', was released in 1981 and reached No.&nbsp;68 in the UK.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> The album's single releases, \"Luxury\" and \"While You Wait\", did not chart. The band performed \"Luxury\" on ''[[Multi-Coloured Swap Shop]]''. In 1981, a compilation album, ''[[Sanctuary (compilation)|Sanctuary]]'', was released exclusively in the United States, consisting of five tracks from ''From A to B'' and seven from ''Anywhere''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Previous to this release, there had also been a four-song [[Gramophone record|10\" vinyl]] \"Straight Lines\" released by [[Sony Music|CBS Records]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] as part of their short-lived [[Epic Records|Epic]] 'Nu-Disk' series, which also included [[The Clash]]'s, ''[[Super Black Market Clash|Black Market Clash]]''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Towner and Hibbert departed, and Mansfield and Gates cut the next album with the assistance of studio musicians.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nAfter the demise of GTO Records, the band released their third and final album, ''[[Warp (album)|Warp]]'', in 1982 which was more experimental than their previous releases. ''Warp'' was almost entirely [[Electronic music|electronic]], and one of the first albums to be recorded primarily with [[digital recording|digital]] [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]s and [[E-mu Emulator|emulator]]s.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> It featured a [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] version of [[The Beatles]]' hit song \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\", alongside an identically titled track of their own. New Musik disbanded shortly after its  release that year.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nMansfield went on to achieve success in the field of [[record producer|production]] with [[After the Fire]], [[a-ha]], [[Aztec Camera]], [[The B-52's]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[Captain Sensible]], [[Naked Eyes]], [[Mari Wilson]], [[Jean Paul Gaultier]], [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]], and [[Ana Torroja]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n''From A to B'' and ''Anywhere'' were released on [[Compact disc|CD]] in 1994, and again in 2001 and 2011, remastered and with bonus tracks. ''Warp'' was also released with bonus tracks on CD for the first time in 2001, exclusively in Japan. Warp's first CD release in the UK came in January 2011 on the Cherry Red label (CDLEMD 182).\n\n==Members==\n===Last line up before disbandment===\n*[[Tony Mansfield]] (1977\u20131982)\n*[[Clive Gates]] (c. 1979\u20131982)\n*Cliff Venner (1982)\n\n===Other members===\n*[[Nick Straker]] (1977\u20131979)\n*[[Tony Hibbert (musician)|Tony Hibbert]] (1977\u201381)\n*Phil Towner (1977\u201381)\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:1000 height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:5 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat  = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/1977 till:04/01/1982\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\n\nColors =\n  id:Lines1      value:gray(0.75)\n\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:1977\n\nBarData =\n  bar:Mansfield  text:\"Tony Mansfield\"\n  bar:Towner     text:\"Phil Towner\"\n  bar:Straker    text:\"Nick Straker\"\n  bar:Hibbert    text:\"Tony Hibbert\"\n  bar:Gates      text:\"Clive Gates\"\n  bar:Venner     text:\"Cliff Venner\"\n\nPlotData=\n  width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(11,-4)\n  bar:Mansfield\t from:01/01/1977 till:04/01/1982 color:Lines1\n  bar:Towner     from:01/01/1977 till:12/31/1981 color:Lines1\n  bar:Straker    from:01/01/1977 till:12/31/1979 color:Lines1\n  bar:Hibbert    from:07/01/1977 till:12/31/1981 color:Lines1\n  bar:Gates      from:01/01/1979 till:04/01/1982 color:Lines1\n  bar:Venner     from:01/01/1982 till:04/01/1982 color:Lines1\n}}\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Retrieved July 18, 2014.</ref>\n}}\n'''''American Hot Wax''''' is a 1978 [[biographical film]] directed by [[Floyd Mutrux]] with a screenplay [[John Kaye (screenwriter)|John Kaye]] from a story by [[Art Linson]]. The film tells the story of pioneering [[disc jockey]] [[Alan Freed]], who in the 1950s helped introduce and popularize [[rock and roll]], and is often credited with coining the term \"Rock 'n' Roll.\" The film starred [[Tim McIntire]], [[Fran Drescher]], [[Jay Leno]], [[Laraine Newman]], [[Jeff Altman]], and [[Moosie Drier]]. It also featured musical performances by [[Chuck Berry]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Frankie Ford]], [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]], and [[Brooklyn Dreams (group)|Brooklyn Dreams]] as \"Professor La Plano and The Planotones\". The film was not a box-office success.\n  \n[[A&M Records]] released a two-record [[soundtrack album]] featuring the Brooklyn Paramount performances from the movie on record one (in stereo) and original recordings used throughout the film on record two (all in mono). The soundtrack reached number 31 on the ''Billboard'' charts, leaving some to wonder {{who|date = September 2018}} just how that was possible with such meager public exposure.\n\nProducer [[Art Linson]] discusses the movie's production and failure at the box office in his book ''What Just Happened? Bitter Hollywood Tales from the Front Line''.\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn late-1950s New York City, WROL disc jockey Alan Freed (Tim McIntire) promotes his upcoming rock n' roll show at the [[Brooklyn Paramount Theater]], headlined by Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis. Freed's radio program is hugely popular with teenagers, and the Paramount show is expected to sell out, despite concern that the police will shut it down as they did with Freed's previous show in Boston. Local law enforcement, led by D.A. Coleman (John Lehne), targets Freed for allegedly inciting teenagers to wild and immoral behavior by broadcasting raucous and sexually suggestive rock n' roll songs, many of them by black musicians. WROL station management also dislike Freed's unconventional programming habits, including playing songs that the station has banned such as [[Tutti Frutti (song)|\"Tutti Frutti\"]] by [[Little Richard]]. Freed nevertheless rejects all suggestions that he change his programming style and feature more socially acceptable musical acts, such as [[Pat Boone]]. He also refuses to sign a statement declaring that he never accepted anything in return for playing a record, on the grounds that signing it would be a lie and that all disc jockeys, including those who have signed the statement, take such bribes. \n\nBecause Freed has the power to make a record a hit by playing it on his show, he is constantly besieged by record promoters and artist managers.  He avoids most of these people, but takes an interest in those who share his love for rock n' roll. He repeatedly ignores the aggressive record promoter Lennie Richfield (Jeff Altman), but is kind to Artie Moress (Moosie Drier), a young boy who is the president of a [[Buddy Holly]] fan club, and even puts Artie on the air to talk about his idol Holly. Freed also encourages Louise (Laraine Newman), a white teenage songwriter whose parents ignore her talent and disapprove of her associating with the Chesterfields, a black [[doo-wop]] group who perform her songs. Freed himself suffers discrimination when he takes a racially mixed group of teenagers with him to look at a luxury home he wants to buy; the owner refuses to sell to him at any price. Freed's own father back in [[Akron, Ohio]] also rejects him, returning a check Freed sent him and refusing to talk on the telephone with his son. \n\nThe Paramount show goes on despite Coleman's attempts to stop it, including a failed attempt at a drug bust. Louise is moved to tears after the Chesterfields, a late addition to the show, perform her songs to thunderous applause from the capacity crowd. Freed's feisty young secretary Sheryl (Fran Drescher) and his chauffeur Mookie (Jay Leno), who have constantly bickered on the job, finally bond over their shared love of Freed and rock n' roll, and begin a romance. Mid-show, [[IRS]] agents appear and seize all the proceeds from the box office, leaving Freed with no money to pay his artists. However, Chuck Berry saves the day by doing Freed the favor of performing for free. Jerry Lee Lewis, who initially had said he was not coming, then arrives at the last minute and closes the show as the police try to shut it down because teenagers are \"dancing in the aisles\". As the police begin clearing the theater with Lewis still performing onstage, chaos breaks out and the film abruptly ends, with an epilogue stating that this was Freed's last performance, and that he was taken off the air, indicted, moved to California, and died five years later, penniless, but that rock n' roll lives on.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tim McIntire]]\u2014[[Alan Freed]]\n*[[Fran Drescher]]\u2014Sheryl\n*[[Jay Leno]]\u2014Mookie (Michael)\n*[[Laraine Newman]]\u2014Teenaged Louise\n*[[Moosie Drier]]\u2014Artie Moress\n*[[Jeff Altman]]\u2014Lennie Richfield\n*John Lehne\u2014D.A.

The film tells the story of pioneering [[disc jockey]] [[Alan Freed]], who in the 1950s helped introduce and popularize [[rock and roll]], and is often credited with coining the term \"Rock 'n' Roll.\" The film starred [[Tim McIntire]], [[Fran Drescher]], [[Jay Leno]], [[Laraine Newman]], [[Jeff Altman]], and [[Moosie Drier]]. It also featured musical performances by [[Chuck Berry]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Frankie Ford]], [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]], and [[Brooklyn Dreams (group)|Brooklyn Dreams]] as \"Professor La Plano and The Planotones\". The film was not a box-office success.\n  \n[[A&M Records]] released a two-record [[soundtrack album]] featuring the Brooklyn Paramount performances from the movie on record one (in stereo) and original recordings used throughout the film on record two (all in mono). The soundtrack reached number 31 on the ''Billboard'' charts, leaving some to wonder {{who|date = September 2018}} just how that was possible with such meager public exposure.\n\nProducer [[Art Linson]] discusses the movie's production and failure at the box office in his book ''What Just Happened? Bitter Hollywood Tales from the Front Line''.\n\n==Plot==\n\nIn late-1950s New York City, WROL disc jockey Alan Freed (Tim McIntire) promotes his upcoming rock n' roll show at the [[Brooklyn Paramount Theater]], headlined by Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis.
