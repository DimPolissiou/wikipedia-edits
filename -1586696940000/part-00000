Rolling news coverage during the day consisted of 20-minute single-topic shows such as ''Fox on Crime'' or ''Fox on Politics'', surrounded by news headlines. Interviews featured facts at the bottom of the screen about the topic or the guest. The flagship newscast at the time was ''The Schneider Report'', with [[Mike Schneider (news anchor)|Mike Schneider]]'s fast-paced delivery of the news. During the evening, Fox featured opinion shows: ''The O'Reilly Report'' (later ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''), ''The Crier Report'' (hosted by [[Catherine Crier]]) and ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]''.\n\nFrom the beginning, FNC has placed heavy emphasis on visual presentation. Graphics were designed to be colorful and gain attention; this helped the viewer to grasp the main points of what was being said, even if they could not hear the host (with on-screen text summarizing the position of the interviewer or speaker, and \"bullet points\" when a host was delivering commentary).

After five years of legal fight, in 2012, the High Court finally passed its judgement admitting that Nicotine and all Nicotine delivery devices were poisons and the State must regulate the same. Thereafter, the States of Punjab, Haryana & Chandigarh added Nicotine in the list of Poison under the Poisons Act of 1919. The High Court also asked the States to constitute a permanent task force for monitoring of the abuse of Nicotine. The high court kept the writ alive, to date, for monitoring purposes. <ref>[https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/hc-issues-notice-to-ban-e-cigarettes/articleshow/63425775.cms |title=HC issues notice to ban e-cigarettes|website=Times of India |location=India |accessdate=25 December 2019}}</ref> Subsequent to the High Court order, in 2013 the Ministry of Health formed an expert committee with the petitioner Hemant Goswami and WHO officials as expert members.

Besides taking tough stands against any proposed amendment to the RTI Act, Goswami has boldly taken senior bureaucrats and Governors to task too for lack of transpaprency and accountability in their offices. When the Governor-Administrator of Chandigarh refused to follow the Right to Information Act, Hemant fought a long and bitter battle to ensure transparency in the office of the Governor-Administrator of Chandigarh.

The court, accepted all the contentions and suggestions put forward by Hemant (who argued the case in-person) and directed that;\n\n* There shall be total ban on the employment of children up to the age of 14 years, be it hazardous or non-hazardous industries.\n* There shall be no forced labour even for children between the age of 14 years to 18 years; and whenever a child above the age of 14 years is forced to work, it has to be treated as an offence under Section 374 IPC and it is to be dealt with sternly.\n* When any matter is brought to the notice of the State Commission (or for that matter suo motu cognizance taken by the State Commission) involving violation of child rights even where a child above the age of 14 year is employed, the State Commission under the CPCR Act will have the jurisdiction to deal with the same and pass necessary directions.\n* The violators have to be dealt with effectively and in a speedy manner. Therefore, wherever violations are found, cases under the provisions of Part-IV of the Child Labour Prohibition Act have to be registered without delay in each and every case.\n* Wherever the officers fail or neglect to take effective action immediately, apart from taking necessary disciplinary action, action can also be taken, in appropriate cases, under Section 166 IPC against such officers.\n* There is also a need for rehabilitation of such children in the society. (Direction/ scheme suggested by Hemant Goswami was adopted by the Court, with the following main points; (a) Moving out the child from the exploitative environment (b) Ensuring Education (c) Ensuring Food/Meals/Clothes/ Necessities (D) Penalty/Compensation should be for the benefit of the Child (e) Regular Monitoring)\n* The Chairperson of \"State Commissions for Protection of Child Rights\" should be a person who has been Judge of the High Court and the process of selection of the other six members of the \"State Commissions for Protection of Child Rights\" should entail issuance of public advertisement for inviting applications, interviewing eligible candidates and recommending a panel of names of suitable persons. \n* States of Punjab and Haryana as well as U.T., Chandigarh shall also ensure that the State Commissions become fully functional by appointing Chairpersons and Members.\n* Children\u2019s Courts with specialised infrastructure be created.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/final-order-of-high-court-in-child-labou-70204/ |title=CWP 2693 of 2010- Hemant Goswami vs. Union of India|website=JD Supra |date=9 April 2013 |accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe order is considered a landmark in \"Child Rights,\" as the court declared many existing provisions of the 1986 child labour legislation as illegal and against the Constitution of India.\n\n===Reforms in Judiciary===\n\nThe method followed for appointment of Judges in the hgher judiciary in India has been openly criticised by Hemant, who consider it to be a source of corruption and inefficiency in the higher judiciary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hemantgoswami.wordpress.com/2007/07/01/a-clean-and-corruption-free-judiciary-what/ |title=A clean and corruption-free judiciary!

In March 2013, lawyers in Chandigarh clashed with some police officials. The High Court decided to take suo-motu notice of the incidence with an objective to absolve the lawyers of any criminal action against them.

After five years of legal fight, in 2012, the High Court finally passed its judgement admitting that Nicotine and all Nicotine delivery devices were poisons and the State must regulate the same. Thereafter, the States of Punjab, Haryana & Chandigarh added Nicotine in the list of Poison under the Poisons Act of 1919. The High Court also asked the States to constitute a permanent task force for monitoring of the abuse of Nicotine.

Therefore, wherever violations are found, cases under the provisions of Part-IV of the Child Labour Prohibition Act have to be registered without delay in each and every case.\n* Wherever the officers fail or neglect to take effective action immediately, apart from taking necessary disciplinary action, action can also be taken, in appropriate cases, under Section 166 IPC against such officers.\n* There is also a need for rehabilitation of such children in the society. (Direction/ scheme suggested by Hemant Goswami was adopted by the Court, with the following main points; (a) Moving out the child from the exploitative environment (b) Ensuring Education (c) Ensuring Food/Meals/Clothes/ Necessities (D) Penalty/Compensation should be for the benefit of the Child (e) Regular Monitoring)\n* The Chairperson of \"State Commissions for Protection of Child Rights\" should be a person who has been Judge of the High Court and the process of selection of the other six members of the \"State Commissions for Protection of Child Rights\" should entail issuance of public advertisement for inviting applications, interviewing eligible candidates and recommending a panel of names of suitable persons. \n* States of Punjab and Haryana as well as U.T., Chandigarh shall also ensure that the State Commissions become fully functional by appointing Chairpersons and Members.\n* Children\u2019s Courts with specialised infrastructure be created.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/final-order-of-high-court-in-child-labou-70204/ |title=CWP 2693 of 2010- Hemant Goswami vs. Union of India|website=JD Supra |date=9 April 2013 |accessdate=15 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe order is considered a landmark in \"Child Rights,\" as the court declared many existing provisions of the 1986 child labour legislation as illegal and against the Constitution of India.\n\n===Reforms in Judiciary===\n\nThe method followed for appointment of Judges in the hgher judiciary in India has been openly criticised by Hemant, who consider it to be a source of corruption and inefficiency in the higher judiciary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hemantgoswami.wordpress.com/2007/07/01/a-clean-and-corruption-free-judiciary-what/ |title=A clean and corruption-free judiciary!

In March 2013, lawyers in Chandigarh clashed with some police officials. The High Court decided to take suo-motu notice of the incidence with an objective to absolve the lawyers of any criminal action against them. Hemant opposed the action of the High Court and filed an intervention in the court opposing the quashing of the [[First Information Report]], asserting that law does not bestow special privileges on advocates and that equality before law should prevail. Criticising the action of the High Court, Hemant wrote to the High Court that collective might and power of a group of people who are collectively registered as a separate juristic person should not be allowed to browbeat the system by putting extraneous pressure and by forceful imposition of their collective bargaining power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/why--special-privilege--for-lawyers-asks-social-activist-files-plea/1086204/0 |title=Why 'special privilege' for lawyers, asks social activist, files plea |website=Raghav Ohri, The Indian Express |location=India |date=11 March 2013 |accessdate=27 March 2013}}</ref> The issue was further escalated by Hemant taking the matter to public domain wherein he raised questions about neutrality of the High Court in the whole episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/challenge-quashing-of-fir-social-activist-to-ut/1089553/0 |title=Challenge quashing of FIR: Social activist to UT |website=Raghav Ohri, The Indian Express |location=India |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=27 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Revival of Sanskrit===\n\nHemant Goswami is also working on protecting the cultural roots of India and its languages.

In the early development of an [[embryo]], myoblasts can either proliferate, or [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into a myotube.  What controls this choice in vivo is generally unclear. If placed in cell culture, most myoblasts will proliferate if enough [[fibroblast growth factor]] (FGF) or another growth factor is present in the medium surrounding the cells. When the growth factor runs out, the myoblasts cease division and undergo terminal differentiation into myotubes.  Myoblast differentiation proceeds in stages.  The first stage, involves cell cycle exit and the commencement of expression of certain genes.\n\nThe second stage of differentiation involves the alignment of the myoblasts with one another. Studies have shown that even rat and chick myoblasts can recognise and align with one another, suggesting evolutionary conservation of the mechanisms involved.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yaffe|title=The formation of hybrid multinucleated muscle fibers from myoblasts of different genetic origin|doi=10.1016/0012-1606(65)90062-X|year=1965|first1=David|last2=Feldman|first2=Michael|journal=Developmental Biology|volume=11|issue=2|pages=300\u2013317}}</ref>\n\nThe third stage is the actual cell fusion itself.

Jerry does odd jobs for a living as he is an undergraduate but Nick has a white-collar job. However, both find themselves jobless due to the economic downturn. Jerry has a school-age nephew named Veer (Master Virej Desai) whom he looks after, as the child has lost his parents. Nick intends to marry his girlfriend, Radhika Awasthi ([[Deepika Padukone]]), who dreams of a lovely wedding, a great honeymoon and a wonderful house to live in after marriage.\n\nOut of a job, Jerry finds it difficult to even pay the school fees of his nephew because of which the government is on the verge of giving the custody of his nephew to a foster family. Nick fears he won't be able to fulfill the dreams of his to-be wife. It is to tide over the difficult times that Jerry and Nick turn to the oldest profession in the world. Jerry and Nick become male escorts for the company \"Desi Boyz\", fulfilling the fantasies of girls and ladies. Nonetheless, Jerry is unable to prevent his nephew from being sent to a foster home; and Nick loses Radhika when she learns of what he has been up to while she is away in India. Frustrated, Nick blames Jerry for forcing him into the profession and asks him to move out of his house and life.\n\nNick now tries to win Radhika back and help comes from the most unlikely source \u2013 Radhika's father Suresh ([[Anupam Kher]]) who has come to London with her. Meanwhile, Jerry registers in college again to complete his graduation so that he can earn enough money to get his nephew back home. In college, Jerry meets Tanya Sharma ([[Chitrangada Singh]]) who used to be his classmate and is now a professor at the same college. Sparks fly between Jerry and Tanya. To make Nick jealous, Radhika dates a man named Ajay ([[Omi Vaidya]]). Nick starts to pick on Ajay, often calling him Vijay intentionally. After some reconsideration, Radhika forgives Nick, but Nick rejects her after she disapproves of Jerry. Meanwhile, Jerry graduates college and also wins Tanya's heart. Nick comes and apologizes to Jerry. All is forgiven when Nick and Jerry reconcile. Jerry then helps Radhika win back Nick.\n\nNick then helps Jerry get a high paying job, and Jerry decides to go to court and get back the custody of his nephew. Ajay turns out to be the lawyer against Jerry's case. He decides to get revenge on Nick by not letting Jerry win his case. Ajay tells the court about Jerry being a male escort and what a bad role model he would be to his nephew, bringing in 3 witnesses to testify against Jerry. He asks each of them if they had paid Jerry for sex, but only one says yes. Ajay is on the verge of winning, but Mr. Desi Boyz comes into the courtroom and influences the judge. Then, Jerry makes an inspiring speech to the judge. He ends up winning the case and gaining full custody of Veer. The economy improves and everyone is happy in the end. In a short ending scene, a newspaper article is shown, that states the recession will strike back, then Mr. Desi Boyz gives a call and says that he has gotten the license for a branch in Mumbai.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Jignesh 'Jerry' Patel (Rocco)\n* [[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]] as Nikhil 'Nick' Mathur (Hunter)\n* [[Sanjay Dutt]] as Mr. Khalnayak\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Radhika Awasthi\n* [[Chitrangada Singh]] as Tanya Sharma\n* [[Master Virej Desai]] as Veer Patel\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Suresh Awasthi, Radhika's father\n* [[Omi Vaidya]] as Ajay Bapat\n* [[Mohnish Bahl]] as Social Worker\n* [[Shraman Jain]] as Rohan, Jerry's Friend\n* [[Bharati Achrekar]] as Jerry's mother\n* [[Satish Kaushik]] as Mr. Dhillon\n* [[Ashwin Mushran]] as Defence Lawyer\n* [[Bruna Abdullah]] in a Special Appearance in song \"Subha Hone Na De\"\n* [[Larissa Bonesi]] in a Special Appearance in song \"Subha Hone Na De\"\n\n==Inspiration==\n''Desi Boyz'' was reported to be inspired by the aftermath of thousands of Indian students being duped by various universities in the West such as Tri Valley University, Herguan University, London Metropolitan University and University of Navarra.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tuteja|first=Joginder|title=\"'Desi Boyz' is a 'Dramady' with a lot of 'Soul'\" - Akshay|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/74018.html|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Yount|first=Stacey|title=More on Desi Boyz|url=http://bollyspice.com/31795/more-on-desi-boyz|accessdate=17 November 2011|date=6 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Varma|first=Lipika|title=I have got all that I wanted, says Akshay Kumar|url=http://www.emirates247.com/bollywood/take-one/i-have-got-all-that-i-wanted-says-akshay-kumar-2011-11-17-1.428712|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plagiarism==\nThe basic plot and even some of the scenes of the movie have been lifted from various [[Adam Sandler]] movies like ''[[Reign Over Me]]'', ''[[Billy Madison]]'' and ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film)|Big Daddy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mensxp.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/11031-movie-review-karan-a-on-why-desi-boyz-is-the-best-of-the-worst-but-still-only-gets-2-stars.html|title=Movie Review: Karan A on Why Desi Boyz Is the Best of the Worst But Still Only Gets 2 Stars|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Desi Boyz'' started filming on 7 November 2010,<ref>{{cite web|title=Desi Boyz Starring Deepika Padukone, Akshay Kumar Begins Production|url=http://www.sawfnews.com/Bollywood/65670.aspx|accessdate=15 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110123500/http://www.sawfnews.com/Bollywood/65670.aspx|archive-date=10 November 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> and completed shooting in May 2011.

Jerry does odd jobs for a living as he is an undergraduate but Nick has a white-collar job. However, both find themselves jobless due to the economic downturn. Jerry has a school-age nephew named Veer (Master Virej Desai) whom he looks after, as the child has lost his parents. Nick intends to marry his girlfriend, Radhika Awasthi ([[Deepika Padukone]]), who dreams of a lovely wedding, a great honeymoon and a wonderful house to live in after marriage.\n\nOut of a job, Jerry finds it difficult to even pay the school fees of his nephew because of which the government is on the verge of giving the custody of his nephew to a foster family. Nick fears he won't be able to fulfill the dreams of his to-be wife. It is to tide over the difficult times that Jerry and Nick turn to the oldest profession in the world. Jerry and Nick become male escorts for the company \"Desi Boyz\", fulfilling the fantasies of girls and ladies. Nonetheless, Jerry is unable to prevent his nephew from being sent to a foster home; and Nick loses Radhika when she learns of what he has been up to while she is away in India. Frustrated, Nick blames Jerry for forcing him into the profession and asks him to move out of his house and life.\n\nNick now tries to win Radhika back and help comes from the most unlikely source \u2013 Radhika's father Suresh ([[Anupam Kher]]) who has come to London with her. Meanwhile, Jerry registers in college again to complete his graduation so that he can earn enough money to get his nephew back home. In college, Jerry meets Tanya Sharma ([[Chitrangada Singh]]) who used to be his classmate and is now a professor at the same college. Sparks fly between Jerry and Tanya. To make Nick jealous, Radhika dates a man named Ajay ([[Omi Vaidya]]). Nick starts to pick on Ajay, often calling him Vijay intentionally. After some reconsideration, Radhika forgives Nick, but Nick rejects her after she disapproves of Jerry. Meanwhile, Jerry graduates college and also wins Tanya's heart. Nick comes and apologizes to Jerry. All is forgiven when Nick and Jerry reconcile. Jerry then helps Radhika win back Nick.\n\nNick then helps Jerry get a high paying job, and Jerry decides to go to court and get back the custody of his nephew. Ajay turns out to be the lawyer against Jerry's case. He decides to get revenge on Nick by not letting Jerry win his case. Ajay tells the court about Jerry being a male escort and what a bad role model he would be to his nephew, bringing in 3 witnesses to testify against Jerry.
