Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of years\u2014the word ''tradition'' itself derives from the [[Latin]] ''tradere'' literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways.\n\nThe phrase \"according to tradition\", or \"by tradition\", usually means that whatever information follows is known only by oral tradition, but is not supported (and perhaps may be refuted) by physical documentation, by a physical artifact, or other quality evidence. ''Tradition'' is used to indicate the quality of a piece of information being discussed. For example, \"According to tradition, Homer was born on Chios, but many other locales have historically claimed him as theirs.\" This tradition may never be proven or disproven. In another example, \"[[King Arthur]], by tradition a true British king, has inspired many well loved stories.\"  Whether they are documented fact or not does not decrease their value as cultural history and literature.\n\nTraditions are a subject of study in several academic fields, especially in [[social sciences]] such as [[folklore studies]], [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], and [[biology]].\n\nThe concept of tradition, as the notion of holding on to a previous time, is also found in political and philosophical discourse. For example, it is the basis of the political concept of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], and also strands of many world religions including [[traditional Catholicism]]. In artistic contexts, tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form. For example, in the performance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer's own preferences. A number of factors can exacerbate the [[loss of tradition]], including [[industrialization]], [[globalization]], and the assimilation or [[marginalization]] of specific cultural groups. In response to this, tradition-preservation attempts have now been started in many countries around the world, focusing on aspects such as traditional languages. Tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of [[modernity]] and should be differentiated from customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules and similar concepts.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:LeningradCodex text.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Leningrad Codex|Textual traditions]] of bound manuscripts of the [[Sefer Torah]] (Torah scroll) are passed down providing additional [[niqqud|vowel points]], [[dagesh|pronunciation marks]] and [[cantillation|stress accents]] in the authentic [[Masoretic Text]] of the [[Jewish Bible]], often the basis for translations of the Christian Old Testament]]\nThe English word ''tradition'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''traditio'' via French, the noun from the verb ''tradere'' (to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping); it was originally used in [[Roman law]] to refer to the concept of legal transfers and [[inheritance]].<ref name=\"Giddens2003\">{{cite book|author=Anthony Giddens|title=Runaway world: how globalization is reshaping our lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPMtVIsNo-wC&pg=PA39|accessdate=5 February 2011|year=2003|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-94487-8|page=39}}</ref><ref name=\"Congar2004\"/> According to [[Anthony Giddens]] and others, the modern meaning of tradition evolved during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, in opposition to modernity and [[progress (history)|progress]].<ref name=\"Giddens2003\"/><ref name=\"Shils2006-3\">Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&pg=PA3 3\u20136]</ref><ref name=\"Shils2006\">Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&pg=PA3 18]</ref>\n\nAs with many other generic terms, there are many definitions of tradition.<ref name=\"Green1997\"/><ref name=\"Shils2006-12\">Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&pg=PA12 12]</ref><ref name=\"Congar2004\">{{cite book|author=Yves Congar|title=The meaning of tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBDnQg5zw8oC&pg=PA9|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=October 2004|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=978-1-58617-021-9|pages=9\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Boyer1990-7\"/> The concept includes a number of interrelated ideas; the unifying one is that tradition refers to beliefs, objects or customs performed or believed in the past, originating in it, transmitted through time by being taught by one generation to the next, and are performed or believed in the present.<ref name=\"Green1997\"/><ref name=\"Shils2006-12\"/>\n\nTradition can also refer to beliefs or customs that are [[prehistory|Prehistoric]], with lost or [[arcane]] origins, existing from ''[[time immemorial]]''.<ref name=\"Shils2006-15\">Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&pg=PA15 15]</ref> Originally, traditions were passed orally, without the need for a [[writing system]].

For example, a certain succession to a chiefdom might be recognized by a colonial power as traditional in order to favour their own candidates for the job. Often these inventions were based in some form of tradition, but were exaggerated, distorted, or biased toward a particular interpretation.\n\nInvented traditions are a central component of modern national cultures, providing a commonality of experience and promoting the unified national identity espoused by [[nationalism]].<ref name=\"HobsbawmRanger-7\">Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&pg=PA7 7]</ref> Common examples include public holidays (particularly those unique to a particular nation), the singing of national anthems, and traditional national cuisine (see [[national dish]]). [[Expatriate]] and immigrant communities may continue to practice the national traditions of their home nation.\n\n==In scholarly discourse==\nIn science, tradition is often used in the literature in order to define the relationship of an author's thoughts to that of his or her field.<ref name = Kurz129>Kurz-Milke and Martignon 129</ref> In 1948, philosopher of science Karl Popper suggested that there should be a \"rational theory of tradition\" applied to science which was fundamentally sociological. For Popper, each scientist who embarks on a certain research trend inherits the tradition of the scientists before them as he or she inherits their studies and any conclusions that superseded it.<ref name = Kurz129/> Unlike [[myth]], which is a means of explaining the natural world through means other than logical criticism, scientific tradition was inherited from Socrates, who proposed critical discussion, according to Popper.<ref name = Kurz129-130>Kurz-Milke and Martignon 129\u2013130</ref> For [[Thomas Kuhn]], who presented his thoughts in a paper presented in 1977, a sense of such a critical inheritance of tradition is, historically, what sets apart the best scientists who change their fields is an embracement of tradition.<ref name = Kurz129-130/>\n\nTraditions are a subject of study in several academic fields in [[social sciences]]\u2014chiefly anthropology, [[archaeology]], and biology\u2014with somewhat different meanings in different fields. It is also used in varying contexts in other fields, such as history, [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. Social scientists and others have worked to refine the commonsense concept of tradition to make it into a useful concept for scholarly analysis. In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Edward Shils]] explored the concept in detail.<ref name=\"Handler and Innekin\"/> Since then, a wide variety of social scientists have criticized traditional ideas about tradition; meanwhile, \"tradition\" has come into usage in biology as applied to nonhuman animals.\n\nTradition as a concept variously defined in different disciplines should not be confused with various traditions (perspectives, approaches) in those disciplines.<ref name=\"Patel2009\">{{cite book|author=Sujata Patel|title=The ISA Handbook of Diverse Sociological Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWZGj7WghCEC&pg=PA5|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=October 2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-84787-402-3|pages=5\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Anthropology===\nTradition is one of the key concepts in anthropology; it can be said that anthropology is the study of \"tradition in traditional societies\".<ref name=\"Boyer1990-7\">{{cite book|author=Pascal Boyer|title=Tradition as truth and communication: a cognitive description of traditional discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7cu0joBSM8C&pg=PR7|accessdate=5 February 2011|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37417-0|pages=7\u2013}}</ref> There is however no \"theory of tradition\", as for most anthropologists the need to discuss what tradition is seems unnecessary, as defining tradition is both unnecessary (everyone can be expected to know what it is) and unimportant (as small differences in definition would be just technical).<ref name=\"Boyer1990-7\"/> There are however dissenting views; scholars such as [[Pascal Boyer]] argue that defining tradition and developing theories about it are important to the discipline.<ref name=\"Boyer1990-7\"/>\n\n===Archaeology===\nIn [[archaeology]], the term ''tradition'' is a set of [[archaeological culture|cultures]] or [[archaeological industry|industries]] which appear to develop on from one another over a period of time. The term is especially common in the study of [[American archaeology]].<ref name=\"Handler and Innekin\" />\n\n===Biology===\nBiologists, when examining groups of non-humans, have observed repeated behaviors which are taught within communities from one generation to the next. Tradition is defined in biology as \"a behavioral practice that is relatively enduring (i.e., is performed repeatedly over a period of time), that is shared among two or more members of a group, that depends in part on socially aided learning for its generation in new practitioners\", and has been called a precursor to \"culture\" in the anthropological sense.<ref name = Fragaszy2>Fragaszy and Perry 2, 12</ref>\n\nBehavioral traditions have been observed in groups of fish, birds, and mammals. Groups of orangutans and chimpanzees, in particular, may display large numbers of behavioral traditions, and in chimpanzees, transfer of traditional behavior from one group to another (not just within a group) has been observed.

Twentieth century philosophy is often divided between an 'analytic' tradition, dominant in Anglophone and Scandinavian countries, and a 'continental' tradition, dominant in German and Romance speaking Europe. Increasingly central to continental philosophy is the project of deconstructing what its proponents, following [[Martin Heidegger]], call 'the tradition', which began with [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. In contrast, some continental philosophers - most notably, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] - have attempted to rehabilitate the tradition of [[Aristotelianism]]. This move has been replicated within analytic philosophy by [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]. However, MacIntyre has himself deconstructed the idea of 'the tradition', instead posing [[Aristotelianism]] as one philosophical tradition in rivalry with others.\n\n==In political and religious discourse==\n[[File:Wigilia potrawy 76.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Holiday celebrations may be passed down as traditions, as is the case with this distinctly Polish Christmas meal, decor with [[Christmas tree#Poland|Christmas tree]], a tradition since the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century]]\n{{main|Traditional values|Traditionalist conservatism}}\nThe concepts of tradition and traditional values are frequently used in political and religious discourse to establish the legitimacy of a particular set of values. In the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the concept of tradition has been used to argue for the centrality and legitimacy of conservative religious values.<ref name=\"Bronner\"/> Similarly, strands of orthodox theological thought from a number of world religions openly identify themselves as wanting a return to tradition. For example, the term \"[[traditionalist Catholic]]\" refers to those, such as [[Marcel Lefebvre|Archbishop Lefebvre]], who want the worship and practices of the church to be as they were before the [[Second Vatican Council]] of 1962\u201365.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marty|first=Martin E.|title=Fundamentalisms observed|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-50878-8|page=92|author2=R.

It is also about preserving the cultural heritage of mankind, especially in the event of war and armed conflict. According to Karl von Habsburg, President Blue Shield International, the destruction of cultural assets, traditions and languages is also part of psychological warfare. The target of the attack is the opponent's identity.

Traditions can persist and evolve for thousands of years\u2014the word ''tradition'' itself derives from the [[Latin]] ''tradere'' literally meaning to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping. While it is commonly assumed that traditions have ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time. Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways.\n\nThe phrase \"according to tradition\", or \"by tradition\", usually means that whatever information follows is known only by oral tradition, but is not supported (and perhaps may be refuted) by physical documentation, by a physical artifact, or other quality evidence. ''Tradition'' is used to indicate the quality of a piece of information being discussed. For example, \"According to tradition, Homer was born on Chios, but many other locales have historically claimed him as theirs.\" This tradition may never be proven or disproven. In another example, \"[[King Arthur]], by tradition a true British king, has inspired many well loved stories.\"  Whether they are documented fact or not does not decrease their value as cultural history and literature.\n\nTraditions are a subject of study in several academic fields, especially in [[social sciences]] such as [[folklore studies]], [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], and [[biology]].\n\nThe concept of tradition, as the notion of holding on to a previous time, is also found in political and philosophical discourse. For example, it is the basis of the political concept of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], and also strands of many world religions including [[traditional Catholicism]]. In artistic contexts, tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form. For example, in the performance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer's own preferences. A number of factors can exacerbate the [[loss of tradition]], including [[industrialization]], [[globalization]], and the assimilation or [[marginalization]] of specific cultural groups. In response to this, tradition-preservation attempts have now been started in many countries around the world, focusing on aspects such as traditional languages. Tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of [[modernity]] and should be differentiated from customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules and similar concepts.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:LeningradCodex text.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Leningrad Codex|Textual traditions]] of bound manuscripts of the [[Sefer Torah]] (Torah scroll) are passed down providing additional [[niqqud|vowel points]], [[dagesh|pronunciation marks]] and [[cantillation|stress accents]] in the authentic [[Masoretic Text]] of the [[Jewish Bible]], often the basis for translations of the Christian Old Testament]]\nThe English word ''tradition'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''traditio'' via French, the noun from the verb ''tradere'' (to transmit, to hand over, to give for safekeeping); it was originally used in [[Roman law]] to refer to the concept of legal transfers and [[inheritance]].<ref name=\"Giddens2003\">{{cite book|author=Anthony Giddens|title=Runaway world: how globalization is reshaping our lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPMtVIsNo-wC&pg=PA39|accessdate=5 February 2011|year=2003|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-94487-8|page=39}}</ref><ref name=\"Congar2004\"/> According to [[Anthony Giddens]] and others, the modern meaning of tradition evolved during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period, in opposition to modernity and [[progress (history)|progress]].<ref name=\"Giddens2003\"/><ref name=\"Shils2006-3\">Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&pg=PA3 3\u20136]</ref><ref name=\"Shils2006\">Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&pg=PA3 18]</ref>\n\nAs with many other generic terms, there are many definitions of tradition.<ref name=\"Green1997\"/><ref name=\"Shils2006-12\">Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&pg=PA12 12]</ref><ref name=\"Congar2004\">{{cite book|author=Yves Congar|title=The meaning of tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBDnQg5zw8oC&pg=PA9|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=October 2004|publisher=Ignatius Press|isbn=978-1-58617-021-9|pages=9\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Boyer1990-7\"/> The concept includes a number of interrelated ideas; the unifying one is that tradition refers to beliefs, objects or customs performed or believed in the past, originating in it, transmitted through time by being taught by one generation to the next, and are performed or believed in the present.<ref name=\"Green1997\"/><ref name=\"Shils2006-12\"/>\n\nTradition can also refer to beliefs or customs that are [[prehistory|Prehistoric]], with lost or [[arcane]] origins, existing from ''[[time immemorial]]''.<ref name=\"Shils2006-15\">Shils [https://books.google.com/books?id=L-zr1Ovc5ggC&pg=PA15 15]</ref> Originally, traditions were passed orally, without the need for a [[writing system]].

For example, a certain succession to a chiefdom might be recognized by a colonial power as traditional in order to favour their own candidates for the job. Often these inventions were based in some form of tradition, but were exaggerated, distorted, or biased toward a particular interpretation.\n\nInvented traditions are a central component of modern national cultures, providing a commonality of experience and promoting the unified national identity espoused by [[nationalism]].<ref name=\"HobsbawmRanger-7\">Hobsbawm [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfvnNdVY3KIC&pg=PA7 7]</ref> Common examples include public holidays (particularly those unique to a particular nation), the singing of national anthems, and traditional national cuisine (see [[national dish]]).

For Popper, each scientist who embarks on a certain research trend inherits the tradition of the scientists before them as he or she inherits their studies and any conclusions that superseded it.<ref name = Kurz129/> Unlike [[myth]], which is a means of explaining the natural world through means other than logical criticism, scientific tradition was inherited from Socrates, who proposed critical discussion, according to Popper.<ref name = Kurz129-130>Kurz-Milke and Martignon 129\u2013130</ref> For [[Thomas Kuhn]], who presented his thoughts in a paper presented in 1977, a sense of such a critical inheritance of tradition is, historically, what sets apart the best scientists who change their fields is an embracement of tradition.<ref name = Kurz129-130/>\n\nTraditions are a subject of study in several academic fields in [[social sciences]]\u2014chiefly anthropology, [[archaeology]], and biology\u2014with somewhat different meanings in different fields. It is also used in varying contexts in other fields, such as history, [[psychology]] and [[sociology]]. Social scientists and others have worked to refine the commonsense concept of tradition to make it into a useful concept for scholarly analysis. In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Edward Shils]] explored the concept in detail.<ref name=\"Handler and Innekin\"/> Since then, a wide variety of social scientists have criticized traditional ideas about tradition; meanwhile, \"tradition\" has come into usage in biology as applied to nonhuman animals.\n\nTradition as a concept variously defined in different disciplines should not be confused with various traditions (perspectives, approaches) in those disciplines.<ref name=\"Patel2009\">{{cite book|author=Sujata Patel|title=The ISA Handbook of Diverse Sociological Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yWZGj7WghCEC&pg=PA5|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=October 2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-84787-402-3|pages=5\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Anthropology===\nTradition is one of the key concepts in anthropology; it can be said that anthropology is the study of \"tradition in traditional societies\".<ref name=\"Boyer1990-7\">{{cite book|author=Pascal Boyer|title=Tradition as truth and communication: a cognitive description of traditional discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7cu0joBSM8C&pg=PR7|accessdate=5 February 2011|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-37417-0|pages=7\u2013}}</ref> There is however no \"theory of tradition\", as for most anthropologists the need to discuss what tradition is seems unnecessary, as defining tradition is both unnecessary (everyone can be expected to know what it is) and unimportant (as small differences in definition would be just technical).<ref name=\"Boyer1990-7\"/> There are however dissenting views; scholars such as [[Pascal Boyer]] argue that defining tradition and developing theories about it are important to the discipline.<ref name=\"Boyer1990-7\"/>\n\n===Archaeology===\nIn [[archaeology]], the term ''tradition'' is a set of [[archaeological culture|cultures]] or [[archaeological industry|industries]] which appear to develop on from one another over a period of time. The term is especially common in the study of [[American archaeology]].<ref name=\"Handler and Innekin\" />\n\n===Biology===\nBiologists, when examining groups of non-humans, have observed repeated behaviors which are taught within communities from one generation to the next. Tradition is defined in biology as \"a behavioral practice that is relatively enduring (i.e., is performed repeatedly over a period of time), that is shared among two or more members of a group, that depends in part on socially aided learning for its generation in new practitioners\", and has been called a precursor to \"culture\" in the anthropological sense.<ref name = Fragaszy2>Fragaszy and Perry 2, 12</ref>\n\nBehavioral traditions have been observed in groups of fish, birds, and mammals. Groups of orangutans and chimpanzees, in particular, may display large numbers of behavioral traditions, and in chimpanzees, transfer of traditional behavior from one group to another (not just within a group) has been observed. Such behavioral traditions may have evolutionary significance, allowing adaptation at a faster rate than genetic change.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2007.05.031\n| issn = 0960-9822\n| volume = 17\n| issue = 12\n| pages = 1038\u20131043\n| last = Whiten\n| first = Andrew\n |author2=Antoine Spiteri |author3=Victoria Horner |author4=Kristin E.

Twentieth century philosophy is often divided between an 'analytic' tradition, dominant in Anglophone and Scandinavian countries, and a 'continental' tradition, dominant in German and Romance speaking Europe. Increasingly central to continental philosophy is the project of deconstructing what its proponents, following [[Martin Heidegger]], call 'the tradition', which began with [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. In contrast, some continental philosophers - most notably, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] - have attempted to rehabilitate the tradition of [[Aristotelianism]]. This move has been replicated within analytic philosophy by [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]. However, MacIntyre has himself deconstructed the idea of 'the tradition', instead posing [[Aristotelianism]] as one philosophical tradition in rivalry with others.\n\n==In political and religious discourse==\n[[File:Wigilia potrawy 76.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Holiday celebrations may be passed down as traditions, as is the case with this distinctly Polish Christmas meal, decor with [[Christmas tree#Poland|Christmas tree]], a tradition since the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century]]\n{{main|Traditional values|Traditionalist conservatism}}\nThe concepts of tradition and traditional values are frequently used in political and religious discourse to establish the legitimacy of a particular set of values. In the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the concept of tradition has been used to argue for the centrality and legitimacy of conservative religious values.<ref name=\"Bronner\"/> Similarly, strands of orthodox theological thought from a number of world religions openly identify themselves as wanting a return to tradition.

The target of the attack is the opponent's identity. It is also intended to address the particularly sensitive cultural memory, the growing cultural diversity and the economic basis (such as tourism) of a state, a region or a municipality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15207&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html|title=UNESCO Legal Instruments: Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict 1999}}</ref><ref>Roger O\u2019Keefe, Camille P\u00e9ron, Tofig Musayev, Gianluca Ferrari \"Protection of Cultural Property.

While manned by Union Navy officers and enlisted personnel and supervised by the [[United States Department of the Navy]], but however the construction of the [[Western Gunboat Flotilla]] in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] cruising and operating along the rivers of the southern [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and was funded by the [[War Department (US)|U.S. War Department]], and at her commissioning the ''Carondelet'' was [[Union Army]] ([[United States Army]]) owned, rather than [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] property.<ref>[[#Silverstone|Silverstone, 2006]], pp. 109, 112.</ref>}} ''Monitor'' played a central role in the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] on 9 March 1862, where, under the command of Lieutenant [[John Lorimer Worden|John L. Worden]], she fought the [[casemate ironclad]] {{ship|CSS|Virginia}} (built on the hull of the [[scuttled]] [[steam frigate]] {{USS|Merrimack|1855|6}}) to a standstill. The unique design of the ship, distinguished by its [[gun turret|revolving turret]] which was designed by American inventor [[Theodore Timby]], was quickly duplicated and established the [[Monitor (warship)|monitor class and type]] of armored steam-powered warship built for the American Navy in the next several decades.\n\nThe remainder of the ship was designed by the Swedish-born engineer and inventor [[John Ericsson]], and hurriedly built in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on the [[East River (New York)|East River]] beginning in late 1861 in only 101 days. ''Monitor'' presented a new concept in ship design and employed a variety of new inventions and innovations in ship building that caught the attention of the world. The impetus to build ''Monitor'' was prompted by the news that the Confederates were building an iron-plated armored vessel, named the ''Virginia'', in the old Federal naval shipyard at [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard|Gosport]], near [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], that could effectively engage the Union ships blockading [[Hampton Roads]] harbor and the [[James River]] leading northwest to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] (capital of the Confederacy), and ultimately advance on [[Washington, D.C.]] up the [[Potomac River]] and other seacoast cities, virtually unchallenged. Before ''Monitor'' could reach Hampton Roads, the Confederate ironclad had already destroyed the sail [[frigate]]s {{USS|Cumberland|1842|6}} and {{USS|Congress|1841|6}} and had run the steam frigate {{USS|Minnesota|1855|6}} [[Ship grounding|aground]]. That night ''Monitor'' arrived and the following morning, just as ''Virginia'' set to finish off ''Minnesota'' and ''St. Lawrence'' on the second day, the new Union ironclad confronted the Confederate ship, preventing her from wreaking further destruction on the wooden Union ships. A four-hour battle ensued, both ships pounding the other with close-range cannon fire, although neither ship could destroy or seriously damage the other. This was the first-ever battle fought between armored warships and marked a turning point in naval warfare.\n\nAfter the Confederates were forced to scuttle and destroy ''Virginia'' as they withdrew in early May 1862 from Norfolk and its naval shipyard, ''Monitor'' sailed up the James River to support the Union Army during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] under General-in-Chief [[George B. McClellan]]. The ship participated in the [[Battle of Drewry's Bluff]] later that month and remained in the area giving support to General McClellan's forces on land until she was ordered to join the [[Union blockade|Union Navy blockaders]] off North Carolina in December. On her way there she [[Shipwrecking#Instability and foundering|foundered]] while under tow, during a storm off [[Cape Hatteras]] on the last day of the year. ''Monitor''{{'}}s wreck was discovered in 1973 and has been partially [[Marine salvage|salvaged]]. Her guns, [[gun turret]], engine and other relics are on display at the [[Mariners' Museum]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]], a few miles from the site of its most important military action.\n\n== Conception ==\n\nWhile the concept of ships protected by armor existed before the advent of the ironclad ''Monitor'',<ref name=Bennett212>[[#Bennett|Bennett, 1900]], pp. 212\u2013213.</ref> the need for iron plating on ship arose only after the explosive [[shell (projectile)|shell]]-firing [[Paixhans gun]] was introduced to naval warfare in the 1820s. The use of heavy iron plating on the sides of warships was not practical until steam propulsion matured enough to carry its great weight. Developments in gun technology had progressed by the 1840s so that no practical thickness of wood could withstand the power of a shell.<ref>[[#Baxter|Baxter, 1933]], pp. 3\u20139.</ref> In response, the United States began construction in 1854 of a steam-powered ironclad warship, ''[[Stevens Battery]]'',<ref name=Gardiner50>[[#Gardiner|Gardiner, 1992]], pp. 50\u201355.</ref> but work was delayed and the designer, [[Robert L.

Ericsson claimed to have sent the French [[Emperor]] [[Napol\u00e9on III]] a proposal for a monitor-type design, with a gun turret, in September 1854, but no record of any such submission could be found in the archives of the French Ministry of the Navy (''[[Ministre de la Marine]]'') when they were searched by naval historian [[James Phinney Baxter III]].<ref>[[#Baxter|Baxter, 1933]], pp. 184\u2013185.</ref> The French followed those ships with the first ocean-going ironclad, the [[armored frigate]] {{ship|French ironclad|Gloire||2}} in 1859, and the British responded with {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}}.<ref name=Gardiner50/>\n\nThe [[Union Navy]]'s attitude towards ironclads changed quickly when it was learned that the Confederates were converting the captured {{USS|Merrimack|1855|6}} to an ironclad at the naval shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia. Subsequently, the urgency of ''Monitor''{{'}}s completion and deployment to Hampton Roads was driven by fears of what the Confederate ironclad, now renamed ''Virginia'', would be capable of doing, not only to Union ships but to cities along the coast and riverfronts. Northern newspapers published daily accounts of the Confederates' progress in converting the ''Merrimack'' to an ironclad; this prompted the Union Navy to complete and deploy ''Monitor'' as soon as possible.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], p. 55.</ref>\n\nWord of ''Merrimack''{{'}}s reconstruction and conversion was confirmed in the North in late February 1862 when [[Mary Louvestre]] of Norfolk, a freed slave who worked as a housekeeper for one of the Confederate engineers working on ''Merrimack'',<ref>[[#cia|CIA: Historical Document: Black Dispatches'']].</ref> made her way through Confederate lines with news that the Confederates were building an ironclad warship.

It also ordered the creation of a board to inquire into the various designs proposed for armored ships. The Union Navy advertised for proposals for \"iron-clad steam vessels of war\" on 7 August and Welles appointed three senior officers as the [[Ironclad Board]] the following day. Their task was to \"examine plans for the completion of iron-clad vessels\" and consider its costs.<ref name=r5>[[#Roberts99|Roberts, 1999]], p. 5</ref>{{efn|Members of the Ironclad board included Commodores [[Joseph Smith (1790\u20131877)|Joseph Smith]], [[Hiram Paulding]] and [[Charles Henry Davis|Charles H.

The board lacked experienced shipbuilders but was compensated by the fact that two of the members had years of shipyard experience.<ref name=r5/>}}\n\nEricsson originally made no submission to the board, but became involved when [[Cornelius Bushnell]], the sponsor of the proposal that became the armored [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{USS|Galena|1862|6}}, needed to have his design reviewed by a [[naval architect|naval constructor]]. The board required a guarantee from Bushnell that his ship would float despite the weight of its armor<ref>[[#Roberts99|Roberts, 1999]], p. 7</ref> and [[Cornelius H. DeLamater]] of New York City recommended that Bushnell consult with his friend Ericsson.<ref>[[#Baxter|Baxter, 1933]], p. 253</ref> The two first met on 9 September and again on the following day, after Ericsson had time to evaluate ''Galena''{{'}}s design. During this second meeting, Ericsson showed Bushnell a model of his own design, the future ''Monitor'', derived from his 1854 design. Bushnell got Ericsson's permission to show the model to Welles, who told Bushnell to show it to the board.<ref name=t4/> Upon review of Ericsson's unusual design, the board was skeptical, concerned that such a vessel would not float, especially in rough seas, and rejected the proposal of a completely iron laden ship. [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]], who had also examined the design, overruled them. Ericsson assured the board his ship would float exclaiming, \"The sea shall ride over her and she shall live in it like a duck\".<ref name=\"Ward-p99\">[[#Ward|Ward, Burns and Burns, 1990]], p. 99</ref> On 15 September, after further deliberations, the board accepted Ericsson's proposal.<ref name=t4>[[#Thompson90|Thompson, 1990]], p. 224</ref> The Ironclad Board evaluated 17 different designs, but recommended only three for procurement on 16 September, including Ericsson's ''Monitor'' design.<ref>[[#Roberts99|Roberts, 1999]], pp. 7, 16\u201317</ref>\n\nThe three ironclad ships selected differed substantially in design and degree of risk. ''Monitor'' was the most innovative design by virtue of its low [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]], shallow[[draft (hull)|-draft]] iron hull, and total dependence on steam power. The riskiest element of its design was its rotating [[gun turret]], something that had not previously been tested by any navy.{{efn|British trials of a turret designed by [[Cowper Phipps Coles|Cowper Coles]] on board the [[floating battery]] [[Aetna-class ironclad floating battery|HMS ''Trusty'']] began the same month.<ref>Brown, pp. 41\u201343</ref>}} Ericsson's guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite the risk involved.<ref name=r711>[[#Roberts99|Roberts, 1999]], pp. 7\u201311</ref>\n\n==Design and description==\n[[File:Monitor model2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Model of USS ''Monitor'']]\n[[File:USS Monitor plans.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Inboard plans of USS ''Monitor''|Inboard plans of USS ''Monitor'']]\n\n''Monitor'' was an unusual vessel in almost every respect and was sometimes sarcastically described by the press and other critics as \"Ericsson's folly\", \"cheesebox on a raft\"<ref>[[#Thulesius|Thulesius, 2007]], pp. 108, 113</ref><ref>[[#Bushnell|Bushnell, Ericsson, Welles, 1899]], pp. 17, 41</ref> and the \"Yankee cheesebox\".<ref>[[#McCordock|McCordock, 1938]], p. 103</ref> The most prominent feature on the vessel was a large cylindrical gun turret mounted [[amidships]] above the low-freeboard upper [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], also called the \"raft\".

It was protected by two layers of {{convert|1/2|in|adj=on}} wrought iron armor. The sides of the \"raft\" consisted of three to five layers of {{convert|1|in|adj=on}} iron plates, backed by about {{convert|30|in|0}} of pine and oak. Three of the plates extended the full {{convert|60|in|0|adj=on}} height of the side, but the two innermost plates did not extend all the way down. Ericsson originally intended to use either six 1-inch plates or a single outer {{convert|4|in|adj=on}} plate backed by three {{convert|3/4|in|adj=on}} plates, but the thicker plate required too much time to roll.<ref name=c5>[[#Canney|Canney, 1993]], p. 29</ref> The two innermost plates were riveted together while the outer plates were bolted to the inner ones. A ninth plate, only {{convert|3/4|in|mm}} thick and {{convert|15|in|0}} wide, was bolted over the [[butt joint]]s of the innermost layer of armor. Glass [[porthole]]s in the deck provided natural light for the interior of the ship; in action these were covered by iron plates.<ref name=t8/>\n\nAfter the duel between the two ironclads at Hampton Roads there was concern by some Navy officials who witnessed the battle that ''Monitor''{{'}}s design might allow for easy boarding by the Confederates. In a letter dated 27 April 1862 Lieutenant Commander O.C. Badger wrote to Lieutenant H. A. Wise, Assistant Inspector of Ordnance, advising the use of \"liquid fire\", scalding water from the boiler through hoses and pipes, sprayed out via the vents and pilothouse window, to repel enemy boarders.<ref>[[#Rawson|Rawson, 1898]], pp. 285\u201386.</ref> Wise who was aboard and inspected ''Monitor'' after the battle responded in a letter of 30 April 1862: \"With reference to the Monitor, the moment I jumped on board of her after the fight I saw that a steam tug with twenty men could have taken the upper part of her in as many seconds&nbsp;... I hear that hot water pipes are arranged so as to scald the assailants when they may dare to set foot on her.\"<ref>[[#Rawson|Rawson, 1898]], pp. 293\u201394</ref> The chance to employ such a tactic never arose.

There was one major delay, however, over the signing of the actual contract with the government.<ref>[[#Baxter|Baxter, 1968]], pp. 258\u201359</ref> Welles insisted that if ''Monitor'' did not prove to be a \"complete success\", the builders would have to refund every cent to the government.<ref>[[#McPherson|McPherson, 1988]], pp. 374\u2013375</ref> Winslow balked at this draconian provision and had to be persuaded by his partners to sign after the Navy rejected his attempt to amend the contract.

These issues were easily fixed and ''Monitor'' was ordered to sail for Hampton Roads on 26 February, but her departure had to be delayed one day to load ammunition. On the morning of 27 February the ship entered the [[East River]] preparatory to leaving New York, but proved to be all but unsteerable and had to be towed back to the navy yard. Upon examination, the steering gear controlling the [[rudder]] had been improperly installed and Rowland offered to realign the rudder, which he estimated to take only a day. Ericsson, however, preferred to revise the steering gear by adding an extra set of [[pulley]]s as he believed it would take less time.

''The Monitor Chronicles: One Sailor's Account&nbsp;...''}} to his wife Martha during the entire time of ''Monitor''{{'}}s service provide many details and insights into every chapter of the ironclad's short-lived history, offering a rare perspective of a sailor's experience on the naval front during the Civil War. The letters of Acting Paymaster [[William Frederick Keeler|William F. Keeler]] to his wife Anna also corroborate many of the accounts of affairs that took place aboard the ''Monitor''. The letters of Geer and Keeler are available for viewing and are housed at the [[Mariners' Museum]] in Virginia.<ref>[[#Geer|George S.

First Assistant Engineer Isaac Newton ordered the engine room abandoned and had the able-bodied crew drag the afflicted engine room hands to the top of the turret where the fresh air could revive them.<ref name=Konstam40/> Both Newton and Stimers worked desperately to get the blowers to work, but they too succumbed to the noxious fumes and were taken above.<ref>[[#Baxter|Baxter, 1968]], p. 289</ref> One [[fireman (steam engine)|fireman]] was able to punch a hole in the fan box, drain the water, and restart the fan. Later that night, the wheel ropes controlling the ship's rudder jammed, making it nearly impossible to control the ship's heading in the rough seas. ''Monitor'' was now in danger of [[Shipwrecking|foundering]], so Worden signaled ''Seth Low'' for help and had ''Monitor'' towed to calmer waters closer to shore so she was able to restart her engines later that evening. She rounded [[Cape Charles (headland)|Cape Charles]] around 3:00&nbsp;pm on 8 March and entered [[Chesapeake Bay]], reaching [[Hampton Roads]] at 9:00&nbsp;pm, well after the first day's fighting in the Battle of Hampton Roads had concluded.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 54\u201357, 74</ref>\n\n===Battle of Hampton Roads===\n{{Main|Battle of Hampton Roads}}\n[[File:The Monitor and Merrimac.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting showing ''Monitor'' engaging ''Virginia'', 9 March 1862|USS ''Monitor'' engaging {{ship|CSS|Virginia}}, 9 March 1862]]\n\nOn 8 March 1862, ''Virginia'', commanded by [[Commander]] [[Franklin Buchanan]],<ref name=Davis216>[[#Davis96|Davis, 1996]], p. 216</ref> was ready to engage the Union flotilla blockading the James River.{{efn|Buchanan was commander of the Washington Navy Yard when the war broke out.<ref>[[#Holzer06|Holzer, Mulligan, 2006]], p. 70</ref>}} ''Virginia'' was powered by ''Merrimack''{{'}}s original engines, which had been condemned by the US Navy before her capture.

Stanton]], Secretary Welles and other senior naval officers, inquiries were made about ''Monitor''{{'}}s ability to stop ''Virginia''{{'}}s prospect of further destruction. When the temperamental Stanton learned that ''Monitor'' had only two guns he expressed contempt and rage as he paced back and forth, further increasing the anxiety and despair among members of the meeting. Assurances from Admiral Dahlgren and other officers that ''Virginia'' was too massive to effectively approach Washington and that ''Monitor'' was capable of the challenge offered him no consolation. After further deliberations Lincoln was finally assured but Stanton remained almost in a state of terror and sent telegrams to various governors and mayors of the coastal states warning them of the danger.<ref>[[#Baxter|Baxter, 1933]], p. 297</ref><ref>[[#Welles|Welles Diary]], Vol. I, p. 65</ref> Subsequently, Stanton approved a plan to load some sixty canal boats with stone and gravel and sink them in the Potomac, but Welles was able to convince Lincoln at the last moment that such a plan would only prevent ''Monitor'' and other Union ships from reaching Washington and that the barges should only be sunk if and when ''Virginia'' was able to make her way up the Potomac.<ref>[[#Welles|Welles Diary]], Vol. I, p. 66</ref>\n\nAbout 9:00&nbsp;pm, ''Monitor'' finally arrived on the scene only to discover the destruction that ''Virginia'' had already wrought on the Union fleet.

At 8:45&nbsp;am Worden gave the order to fire where Greene fired the first shots of the battle between the two ironclads which harmlessly deflected off the Confederate ironclad. During the battle ''Monitor'' fired solid shot, about once every eight minutes, while ''Virginia'' fired shell exclusively.<ref>[[#Maclay|Maclay, 1894]], p. 314</ref> The ironclads fought, generally at close range, for about four hours, ending at 12:15&nbsp;pm,<ref>[[#Ward|Ward, Burns and Burns, 1990]], pp. 95, 101</ref>{{efn|Accounts vary, some claim the battle lasted no more than three and a half hours,<ref name=Tucker171/> while some claim as many as five hours.<ref>[[#Varhola|Varhola, 1999]], p. 221</ref>}} ranging from a few yards to more than a hundred. Both ships were constantly in motion, maintaining a circular pattern. Because of ''Virginia''{{'}}s weak engines, great size and weight, and a draft of {{convert|22|ft|m|abbr=on}}, she was slow and difficult to maneuver, taking her half an hour to complete a 180-degree turn.<ref>[[#McPherson|McPherson, 1988]], pp. 373\u201374</ref>\n\nDuring the engagement, ''Monitor''{{'}}s turret began to malfunction, making it extremely difficult to turn and stop at a given position, so the crew simply let the turret continuously turn and fired their guns \"on the fly\" as they bore on ''Virginia''. Several times, ''Monitor'' received direct hits on the turret, causing some bolts to violently shear off and ricochet around inside. The deafening sound of the impact stunned some of the crew, causing nose and ear bleeding.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 109\u2013111</ref><ref name=leckie211>[[#Leckie|Leckie, 1990]], p. 211</ref> However, neither vessel was able to sink or seriously damage the other. At one point, ''Virginia'' attempted to ram, but only struck ''Monitor'' a glancing blow and did no damage. The collision did, however, aggravate the damage to ''Virginia''{{'}}s bow from when she had previously rammed ''Cumberland''. ''Monitor'' was also unable to do significant damage to ''Virginia'', possibly because her guns were firing with reduced charges, on advice from Commander [[John Dahlgren]], the gun's designer, who lacked the \"preliminary information\" needed to determine what amount of charge was needed to \"pierce, dislocate or dislodge iron plates\" of various thicknesses and configurations.<ref name=\"Nelson, James L 2005 400 pages\"/><ref name=Dahlgren279>[[#Dahlgren|Dahlgren, 1882]], p. 279</ref>{{efn|In a letter of 19 March 1862, to Captain A.

With one of the gun port covers jammed shut, she hauled off to shallow waters to resupply the turret and repair the damaged hatch, which could not be fixed. During the lull in the battle, Worden climbed through the gun port out onto the deck to get a better view of the overall situation. ''Virginia'', seeing ''Monitor'' turn away, turned her attention to the ''Minnesota'' and fired shots that set the wooden vessel ablaze, also destroying the nearby [[tugboat]] ''Dragon''. When the turret was resupplied with ammunition, Worden returned to battle with only one gun able to fire.<ref name=Field56>[[#Field|Field, 2011]], p. 56</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the engagement, Worden directed Williams to steer ''Monitor'' around the stern of Confederate ironclad, where [[John Taylor Wood|Lieutenant Wood]] fired ''Virginia''{{'}}s 7-inch Brooke gun at ''Monitor''{{'}}s [[pilothouse]], striking the forward side directly beneath the sight hold, cracking the structural \"iron log\" along the base of the narrow opening just as Worden was peering out.<ref>[[#Field|Field, 2011]], pp. 36\u201337, 56\u201357</ref> Worden was heard to have cried out, ''My eyes\u2014I am blind!''

Greene did not pursue ''Virginia''<ref>[[#Still88|Still, 1988]], p. 7</ref> and, like Worden, was under orders to stay with and protect ''Minnesota'',<ref>[[#Holzer06|Holzer, Mulligan, 2006]], p. 101</ref> an action for which he was later criticized.\n\nAs a result of the duel between the two ironclads, ''Monitor'' had been struck twenty-two times, including nine hits to the turret and two hits to the pilothouse. She had managed to fire forty-one shots from her pair of Dahlgren guns. ''Virginia'' had sustained ninety-seven indentations to her armor from the fire of ''Monitor'' and other ships. Neither ship had sustained any significant damage.

The battle itself was largely considered a draw, though it could be argued ''Virginia'' did slightly more damage.<ref name=Wilson32/> ''Monitor'' did successfully defend ''Minnesota'' and the rest of the Union blockading force, while ''Virginia'' was unable to complete the destruction she started the previous day.

No sooner than ''Monitor'' had weighed anchor, numerous small boats and spectators on shore flocked around the ship to congratulate the crew for what they regarded as their victory over ''Virginia''. Assistant Secretary Fox, who observed the entire battle from aboard ''Minnesota'', came aboard ''Monitor'' and jokingly told her officers, \"Well gentlemen, you don't look as though you just went through one of the greatest naval conflicts on record\". A small tug soon came alongside and the blinded Worden was brought up from his cabin while crew members and spectators cheered. He was taken directly to Fort Monroe for preliminary treatment, then to a hospital in Washington shortly thereafter.<ref>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 71</ref>\n\nStimers and Newton soon began repairing the damage to the pilot house and reconfigured the sides from an upright position to a slope of thirty degrees to deflect the shot. During this time, Mrs. Worden personally brought news of her husband's progress and recovery and was optimistic, informing the crew his eyesight would soon return but he would be laid up for some time. She also informed them President Lincoln had personally paid Worden a visit extending his gratitude.<ref>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 97</ref> Worden was later taken to his summer home in New York and remained unconscious for three months.<ref>[[#Still88|Still, 1988]], p. 8</ref> He returned to Naval service in 1862 as captain of {{USS|Montauk|1862|6}}, another ''Monitor''-type ironclad.\n\nThe Confederates were also celebrating what they considered a victory, as crowds of spectators gathered along the banks of the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]], cheering and waving flags, handkerchiefs and hats as ''Virginia'', displaying the captured [[ensign]] of ''Congress'', passed along up the river. The Confederate government was ecstatic and immediately promoted Buchanan to Admiral.<ref>[[#Quarstein12|Quarstein, 2012]], p. 169</ref>\n\nBoth the Union and Confederacy soon came up with plans for defeating the other's ironclad. Oddly, these did not depend on their own ironclads. The Union Navy chartered a large ship (the [[Paddle steamer|sidewheeler]] {{USS|Vanderbilt|1862|6}}) and reinforced her bow with steel specifically to be used as a [[naval ram]], provided ''Virginia'' steamed far enough out into Hampton Roads.<ref>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 108</ref>\n\nOn 11 April, ''Virginia'', accompanied by a number of gunboats, steamed into Hampton Roads to Sewell's Point at the southeast edge, almost over to [[Newport News]], in a challenge to ''Monitor'' in an attempt to lure the Union ironclad into battle. ''Virginia'' fired a few shots ineffectively at very long range, while ''Monitor'' returned fire while remaining near Fort Monroe, ready to fight if ''Virginia'' came to attack the Federal force congregated there.<ref>[[#Bennett|Bennett, 1900]], pp. 136\u2013137</ref> Furthermore, ''Vanderbilt'' was in position to ram ''Virginia'' if she approached the fort. ''Virginia'' did not take the bait.<ref>[[#Broadwater|Broadwater, 2012]], p. 88</ref> In a further attempt to entice ''Monitor'' closer to the Confederate side, so she could be boarded, the James River Squadron moved in and captured three merchant ships, the brigs ''Marcus'' and ''Sabout'', and the schooner ''Catherine T. Dix''.<ref>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 109</ref> These had been grounded and abandoned when they sighted ''Virginia'' entering the Roads. Their flags were then hoisted \"[[Distress signal#Flags|Union-side down]]\" to taunt ''Monitor'' into a fight as they were towed back to Norfolk. In the end, both sides had failed to provoke a fight on their terms.<ref>[[#Anderson|Anderson, 1989]], pp. 77\u201378</ref>\n\nThe [[Confederate Navy]] originally had devised a plan where the [[James River Squadron]] would swarm ''Monitor'' with a party of men with the intention of capturing the vessel by boarding and disabling her by using heavy hammers to drive iron wedges under and disabling the turret and by covering the pilothouse with a wet sail effectively blinding the pilot. Others would throw combustibles down the ventilation openings and smoke holes. At one point Jones made such an attempt to board the vessel but she managed to slip away around the stern of ''Virginia'' in time.<ref name=\"Field56\"/>\n\nA second meeting occurred on 8 May, when ''Virginia'' came out while ''Monitor'' and four other Federal ships bombarded Confederate batteries at Sewell's Point. The Federal ships retired slowly to Fort Monroe, hoping to lure ''Virginia'' into the Roads. She did not follow, however, and after firing a gun to windward as a sign of contempt, anchored off Sewell's Point. Later, when Confederate forces abandoned Norfolk on 11 May 1862, they were forced to destroy ''Virginia''.<ref>[[#Quarstein12|Quarstein, 2012]], p. 15</ref>\n\n===Battle of Drewry's Bluff===\n[[File:Battle of Drewry's Bluff.jpg|thumb|alt=|Engraving of [[Battle of Drewry's Bluff]]]]\n{{main|Battle of Drewry's Bluff}}\nAfter the destruction of ''Virginia'', ''Monitor'' was free to assist the [[Union Army]] and [[George B.

The force had instructions to coordinate their efforts with McClellan's forces on land and push on towards Richmond to bombard the city into surrender if possible. Without any assistance, the task force got within {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} of the Confederate capital but could not proceed further because of sunken vessels and debris placed in the river that blocked further passage. There were also artillery batteries at [[Fort Darling]] overlooking and guarding the approach, along with other heavy guns and sharpshooters positioned along the river banks.

However most of the time spent on the river was marked with inactivity and hot weather which had a negative effect on the morale of ''Monitor''{{'}}s crew. During the long, hot, summer, several crew members became sick and were transferred to Hampton Roads while various officers were replaced including Newton, while Jeffers was replaced by Commander [[Thomas H. Stevens, Jr.]]{{efn|Stevens previously served as commander of {{USS|Maratanza|1861|6}}.<ref name=Quarstein149/>}} on 15 August. By the end of August, ''Monitor'' was ordered back to Hampton Roads and dropped anchor nearby the sunken ''Cumberland'' at Newport News Point on 30 August, much to the approval of the crew.

When Stodder and others came to close up the dock and ship one evening Stodder noted, \"When we came up to clean that night there was not a key, doorknob, [[Escutcheon (furniture)|escutcheon]] \u2013 there wasn't a thing that hadn't been carried away.\"<ref>[[#Quarstein06|Quarstein, 2006]], p. 241</ref>\n\nBefore ''Monitor'' was put into [[dry dock]] for repairs, Lincoln, Fox, various officials and a few of Worden's close friends arrived to ceremoniously review the vessel and pay respect to the crew and former commander Worden, who after a long and partial recovery arrived for the occasion. Entire army regiments were also directed to come by the navy yard and review the ship and honor the crew. ''Monitor''{{'}}s crew assembled on deck in formation with their officers in front, while Lincoln, Fox and other guests stood near the turret. When Worden, with part of his face blackened from the wounds he received at Hampton Roads, came aboard, the heavy guns in the navy yard were fired in [[Salute#Heavy arms: gun salutes|salute]]. Lincoln came forward and greeted Worden and then introduced him to some of the others. After his formal greeting the crew swarmed around Worden and embraced and shook hands with their former commander and thanked God for his recovery and return. Worden called each of them by name and spoke friendly to and complimented each of them personally. When order was restored the President gave a short speech about Worden's career. At Fox's request, Worden gave a speech to the gathering about his voyage from New York to Hampton Roads, the trials they were faced with along the way and of the great battle between ''Monitor'' and ''Virginia'', while paying [[tribute]] to many of the officers and men involved. In closing he gave special thanks to Ericsson, Lincoln, Welles and all who made construction of ''Monitor'' possible.<ref name=Nelson323>[[#Nelson2009|Nelson, 2009]], p. 323</ref><ref>[[#Worden|Worden, Greene, 1912]], pp. 1\u20136, 21\u201322</ref>\n\nWhile ''Monitor'' was undergoing repairs her crew was put aboard {{USS|King Philip|1845|6}} and were eventually granted a furlough by Bankhead who himself went on leave.<ref>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 156</ref> For approximately six weeks the vessel remained in dry dock while her bottom was scraped clean, the engines and boilers were overhauled, the entire vessel was cleaned and painted, and a number of improvements made, including an iron shield around the top of the turret.<ref name=Bankhead/> To make the vessel more seaworthy, a {{convert|30|ft|m|0|adj=on}} funnel-shaped [[smokestack]] was placed over the smoke outlet while taller fresh air vents were installed. The [[berth deck]] below was also enlarged and raised by removing some of the side storerooms and placing them below, thus reducing the height of the interior which now barely allowed the crew to stand upright. Several cranes were also added while interior improvements were made making the confining environment more livable. A large blower that operated with its own engine was installed which drew fresh air down through the pilothouse. During this time the two Dahlgren guns were each engraved with large letters, ''MONITOR & MERRIMAC \u2013 WORDEN'' and ''MONITOR & MERRIMAC \u2013 ERICSSON'', respectively.{{efn|In the actual engravings the men's names are inscribed below those of the ships' names. e.g. MONITOR & MERRIMA WORDEN}} Additional iron plates were installed covering the dents from the previous battles. Each plate was inscribed with the name of the source from where the shell causing the dent was made. i.e. ''Merrimack, Fort Darling'', etc.<ref name=Nelson323/><ref>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], pp. 156\u2013157</ref> [[Stanchions]] were also installed around the perimeter of the freeboard with a rope strung through each making it safer to walk about the deck amid stormy weather and rough seas.<ref name=Nelson323/> ''Monitor'' was finally taken out of dry dock on 26 October. By November the ship was fully repaired and ready to return to service.<ref name=Bankhead/><ref>[[#Still88|Still, 1988]], p. 67</ref>\n\n=== Final voyage ===\n[[File:USS Monitor - H58758.jpg|thumb|alt=|Engraving of USS&nbsp;''Monitor'' sinking, with {{USS|Rhode Island|1860|6}} in the background]]\n\nOn 24 December 1862, orders were issued directing ''Monitor'' to [[Beaufort, North Carolina]] to join {{USS|Passaic|1862|6}} and {{USS|Montauk|1862|6}} for a joint Army-Navy expedition against Wilmington, North Carolina, where she would join the blockade off [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. The orders were received by the crew on Christmas Day, some of whom had been aboard ''Monitor'' on her harrowing journey from New York to Hampton Roads in March and were not pleased with the prospect of taking to the high seas once again. Dana Greene remarked, \"I do not consider this steamer a sea going vessel\".<ref>[[#Quarstein99|Quarstein, 1999]], p. 121</ref>\n\nThe crew celebrated Christmas aboard ''Monitor'' while berthed at Hampton Roads in what was described as a most merry fashion, while many other celebrations were occurring along the shore. The ship's cook was paid one dollar to prepare a meal for the crew befitting the day; it was received with mixed opinion. That day, ''Monitor'' was made ready for sea, her crew under strict orders not to discuss the impending voyage with anyone, but bad weather delayed her departure until 29 December.<ref name=\"Quarstein-p106\">[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 106</ref>\n\nWhile the design of ''Monitor'' was well-suited for river combat, her low freeboard and heavy turret made her highly unseaworthy in rough waters. Under the command of [[John P. Bankhead]], ''Monitor'' put to sea on 31 December, under tow from the steamship {{USS|Rhode Island|1860|6}}, as a heavy storm developed off [[Cape Hatteras|Cape Hatteras, North Carolina]]. Using chalk and a blackboard, Bankhead wrote messages alerting ''Rhode Island'' that if ''Monitor'' needed help she would signal with a red lantern.<ref name=Quarstein171>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 171</ref>\n\n''Monitor'' was soon in trouble as the storm increased in ferocity. Large waves were splashing over and completely covering the deck and pilot house so the crew temporarily rigged the wheel atop the turret which was manned by helmsman Francis Butts.<ref>[[#Thulesius|Thulesius, 2007]], p. 136</ref> Water continued flooding into the vents and ports and the ship began rolling uncontrollably in the high seas. Sometimes she would drop into a wave with such force the entire hull would tremble. Leaks were beginning to appear everywhere. Bankhead ordered the engineers to start the [[Worthington pump]]s, which temporarily stemmed the rising waters, but soon ''Monitor'' was hit by a squall and a series of violent waves and water continued to work its way into the vessel. Right when the Worthington pump could no longer keep pace with the flooding, a call came from the engine room that water was gaining there. Realizing the ship was in serious trouble, Bankhead signaled ''Rhode Island'' for help and hoisted the red lantern next to ''Monitor''{{'}}s white running light atop the turret. He then ordered the anchor dropped to stop the ship's rolling and pitching with little effect, making it no easier for the rescue boats to get close enough to receive her crew. He then ordered the towline cut and called for volunteers,<ref>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 172</ref> Stodder, along with crewmates John Stocking,<ref>His real name was Wells Wentz; see [https://www.usni.org/magazines/naval-history-magazine/2013/may/lost-men-monitor US Naval Institute Magazine 2013]-thus he is listed under his real name in the USS Monitor Cenopath memorial gravestone</ref> and James Fenwick volunteered and climbed down from the turret, but eyewitnesses said that as soon as they were on the deck Fenwick and Stocking were quickly swept overboard and drowned. Stodder managed to hang onto the safety lines around the deck and finally cut through the {{convert|13|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} towline with a hatchet.<ref>[[#Mariner30|Mariner's Museum, Article: The Last Voyage of the USS Monitor]]</ref> At 11:30&nbsp;pm. Bankhead ordered the engineers to stop engines and divert all available steam to the large Adams [[Centrifugal pump|centrifugal steam pump]];<ref name=Voyage>[[#Mariner24|Mariner's Museum, Article: Last Voyage]]</ref> but with reduced steam output from a boiler being fed wet coal, it too was unable to stem the rapidly rising water.<ref>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], pp. 171\u201372;</ref><ref>[[#Broadwater|Broadwater, 2012]], p. 13</ref> After all of the steam pumps had failed, Bankhead ordered some of the crew to man the [[hand pump]]s and organized a [[bucket brigade]], but to no avail.<ref name=Quarstein149/>\n\nGreene and Stodder were among the last men to abandon ship and remained with Bankhead who was the last surviving man to abandon the sinking ''Monitor''. In his official report of ''Monitor'' to the Navy Department, Bankhead praised Greene and Stodder for their heroic efforts and wrote, \"I would beg leave to call the attention of the Admiral and of the Department of the particularly good conduct of Lieutenant Greene and Acting Master Louis N. Stodder, who remained with me until the last, and by their example did much toward inspiring confidence and obedience on the part of the others.\"<ref name=\"Still, 1988, p. 20\"/>\n\nAfter a frantic rescue effort, ''Monitor'' finally foundered and sank approximately {{convert|16|mi|km}} southeast off Cape Hatteras with the loss of sixteen men,<ref>{{cite web |title=USS Monitor |url=https://monitor.noaa.gov/shipwrecks/uss_monitor.html |website=monitor.noaa.gov |publisher=Monitor National Marine Sanctuary |accessdate=3 July 2019 |language=English |quote=In the end, 16 of the brave men onboard the Monitor never met the year of 1863.}}</ref> including four officers, some of whom remained in the turret and went down with the ironclad. Forty-seven men were rescued by the life boats from ''Rhode Island''.<ref>[[#Broadwater|Broadwater, 2012]], p. 12</ref><ref>[[#Holloway|Holloway, 2013]], pp. 7\u20138</ref>{{efn|William Keeler in Annual Report of the Secretary of the Navy, (Washington: D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1863)}} Bankhead, Greene and Stodder barely managed to get clear of the sinking vessel and survived the ordeal,<ref name=Voyage/> but suffered from exposure from the icy winter sea.<ref>[[#Mariner2013|Mariner's Museum, Article: John P. Bankhead, 2013]]</ref> After his initial recovery, Bankhead filed his official report, as did the commanding officers of the ''Rhode Island'', stating officers and men of both ''Monitor'' and ''Rhode Island'' did everything within their ability to keep ''Monitor'' from sinking. The Navy did not find it necessary to commission a board of inquiry to investigate the affair and took no action against Bankhead or any of his officers.<ref>[[#Broadwater|Broadwater, 2012]], p. 14</ref>\n\nSome time later a controversy emerged over why ''Monitor'' sank. In the ''Army and Navy Journal'', Ericsson accused the crew of drunkenness during the storm, being consequently unable to prevent the vessel from sinking. Stodder vigorously defended the crew and rebuked Ericsson's characterization of the crew and events and wrote to Pierce that Ericsson \"covers up defects by blaming those that are now dead\", pointing out that there were a number of unavoidable events and circumstances that led to the ship's sinking, foremost being the overhang between the upper and lower hulls which came loose and partially separated during the storm from slamming into the violent waves. Stodder's account was corroborated by other shipmates.<ref>[[#Mindell|Mindell, 2000]], p. 140</ref>\n\n==Rediscovery==\nThe Navy tested an \"underwater locator\" in August 1949 by searching an area south of the [[Cape Hatteras Light]]house for the wreck of ''Monitor''. It found a {{convert|140|ft|m|1|adj=on}} long object bulky enough to be a shipwreck, in {{convert|310|ft|m|1}} of water that was thought to be ''Monitor'', but powerful currents negated attempts by divers to investigate.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], p. 32</ref> Retired [[Rear Admiral]] [[Edward Ellsberg]] proposed using external [[pontoon (boat)|pontoon]]s to raise the wreck in 1951, the same method of [[marine salvage]] he had used on the sunken [[submarine]] {{USS|S-51|SS-162|2}}, for the cost of $250,000.<ref>[[#Harvard51|Harvard Journal, April 1951]]</ref> Four years later, [[Robert F. Marx]] claimed to have discovered the wreck based on the idea she had drifted into shallow water north of the [[lighthouse]] before sinking. Marx said he had dived on the wreck and placed a Coke bottle with his name on it in one of the gun barrels, although he never provided any proof of his story.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 32\u201333</ref>\n\nInterest in locating the ship revived in the early 1970s and [[Duke University]], the [[National Geographic Society]] and the [[National Science Foundation]] sponsored an expedition in August 1973 to search for the wreck using a towed [[sonar]] system. The Duke team was led by John G. Newton<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://monitor.noaa.gov/150th/discovery.html | title=Monitor 150th Anniversary - Discovery of the Monitor}}</ref> (no known relation to the Isaac Newton that served on the Monitor). On 27 August, ''Monitor'' was discovered 111 years after sinking, near [[Cape Hatteras]] at coordinates {{Coord|35|0|6|N|75|24|23|W|display=inline,title}}. They sent a camera down to photograph the wreck, but the pictures were so fuzzy as to be useless; on a second attempt the camera snagged something on the wreck and was lost. The sonar images did not match what they expected the wreck to look like until they realized that the sinking vessel had turned over while descending and was resting at the bottom upside down. The team announced their discovery on 8 March 1974. Another expedition was mounted that same month to confirm the discovery and the research [[submersible]] ''[[Alcoa Sea Probe]]'' was able to take still photos and video of the wreck that confirmed it was ''Monitor''.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 34\u201337</ref>\n\nThese photos revealed that the wreck was disintegrating and the discovery raised another issue. Since the Navy had formally abandoned the wreck in 1953, it could be exploited by divers and private salvage companies as it lay outside North Carolina's territorial limits.{{efn|\"Research and case law in the 1970s and 1980s determined that the U.S. Navy abandonment of the USS ''Monitor'' consisted only of striking the vessel from the [[Navy List]], an action more accurately described as a decision to 'surplus' ships, not a legal abandonment of the warship as an item of federal property. In fact, aside from express authority from Congress, the act of abandonment is outside the authority of any agency, including the Navy. The Navy can decommission a ship, but must follow 'surplus property' procedures administered by the [[General Services Administration]] to actually dispose of the ship.\"<ref>[[#Broadwater|Broadwater, 2012]], p. 62</ref>}} To preserve the ship, the wreck, and everything around it, a {{convert|.5|nmi|lk=in|adj=on}} radius was designated as the [[Monitor National Marine Sanctuary]], the first U.S. [[marine sanctuary]], on 30 January 1975.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 37\u201338</ref> ''Monitor'' was also designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] on 23 June 1986.<ref>[[#Broadwater|Broadwater, 2012]], p. 91</ref>\n\n[[File:USS Monitor Anchor.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Photo showing anchor of the Monitor at the Mariner's Museum|USS ''Monitor'' anchor at the Mariners' Museum]]\nIn 1977, scientists were finally able to view the wreckage in person as the submersible ''[[Johnson Sea Link]]'' was used to inspect it. The ''Sea Link'' was able to ferry divers down to the sunken vessel and retrieve small artifacts.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 38\u201340</ref> U.S. Navy interest in raising the entire ship ended in 1978 when Captain [[Willard Franklyn Searle|Willard F. Searle Jr.]] calculated the cost and possible damage expected from the operation: $20&nbsp;million to stabilize the vessel in place, or as much as $50&nbsp;million to bring all of it to the surface.<ref name=orlando1998>[[#Erickson98|Erickson, 1998]], part 5 of 5, p. 2</ref> Research continued and artifacts continued to be recovered, including the ship's {{convert|1500|lb|adj=on}} anchor in 1983. The growing number of relics required conservation and a proper home so the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), in charge of all U.S. marine sanctuaries, selected the Mariners' Museum on 9 March 1987 after considering proposals from several other institutions.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 42\u201343</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Broadwater|first1=John|title=The USS Monitor: In Situ Preservation and Recovery|url=https://www.academia.edu/3257947|website=academia.edu|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Recovery===\n[[File:UpsideDownTurret1.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo showing recovery of turret as it hoisted up and breaks the surface|Replica of ''Monitor''{{'}}s turret in the Mariners' Museum as it was recovered]]\nInitial efforts in 1995 by Navy and NOAA divers to raise the warship's propeller were foiled by an abnormally stormy season off Cape Hatteras. Realizing that raising the whole wreck was impractical for financial reasons as well as the inability to bring up the wreck intact, NOAA developed a comprehensive plan to recover the most significant parts of the ship, namely her engine, propeller, guns, and turret. It estimated that the plan would cost over 20 million dollars to implement over four years. The Department of Defense Legacy Resource Management Program contributed $14.5&nbsp;million. The Navy divers, mainly from its two [[Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit]]s, would perform the bulk of the work necessary in order to train in deep sea conditions and evaluate new equipment.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 44\u201348</ref>\n\nAnother effort to raise ''Monitor''{{'}}s propeller was successful on 8 June 1998, although the amount of effort required to work in the difficult conditions off Cape Hatteras was underestimated and the fewer than 30 divers used were nearly overwhelmed. The 1999 dive season was mostly research oriented as divers investigated the wreck in detail, planning how to recover the engine and determining if they could stabilize the hull so that it would not collapse onto the turret. In 2000 the divers [[Shoring|shored]] up the port side of the hull with bags of [[grout]], installed the engine recovery system, an external framework to which the engine would be attached, in preparation for the next season, and made over five times as many dives as they had the previous season.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 48\u201350</ref>\n\nThe 2001 dive season concentrated on raising the ship's steam engine and [[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]. Hull plates had to be removed to access the engine compartment and both the engine and the condenser had to be separated from the ship, the surrounding wreckage and each other. A [[Mini Rover ROV]] was used to provide visibility of the wreck and divers to the support staff above water. The engine was raised on 16 July and the condenser three days later by the [[crane barge]] ''Wotan''. [[Saturation diving]] was evaluated by the Navy that dive season on ''Monitor'' and proved to be very successful, allowing divers to maximize their time on the bottom.<ref>[[#Broadwater|Broadwater, 2012]], pp. 156\u201362</ref> The [[Surface supplied diving|surface-supplied divers]] evaluated the use of [[heliox]] due to the depth of the wreck.

Around 160 divers were assigned to remove the parts of the hull, including the armor belt, that lay on top of the turret using chisels, [[exothermic]] [[cutting torch]]es and {{convert|20000|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on}} [[Hydrodemolition|hydroblasters]]. They removed as much of the debris from inside the turret as possible to reduce the weight to be lifted. This was usually [[Concretion|concreted]] coal as one of the ship's coal bunkers had ruptured and dumped most of its contents into the turret. The divers prepared the turret roof for the first stage of the lift by excavating underneath the turret and placed steel beams and angle irons to reinforce it for its move onto a lifting platform for the second stage. A large, eight-legged lifting frame, nicknamed the \"spider\", was carefully positioned over the turret to move it onto the platform and the entire affair would be lifted by the crane mounted on the ''Wotan''. The divers discovered one skeleton in the turret on 26 July before the lift and spent a week carefully chipping about half of it free of the concreted debris; the other half was inaccessible underneath the rear of one of the guns.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 63, 102, 120, 186, 210</ref>\n\nWith [[Tropical Storm Cristobal (2002)|Tropical Storm Cristobal]] bearing down on the recovery team, and time and money running out,<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 212\u201313, 230</ref> the team made the decision to raise the turret on 5 August 2002, after 41 days of work, and the gun turret broke the surface at 5:30&nbsp;pm to the cheers of everyone aboard ''Wotan'' and other recovery ships nearby.<ref>[[#Broadwater|Broadwater, 2012]], p. 183</ref> As archaeologists examined the contents of the turret after it has been landed aboard ''Wotan'', they discovered a second skeleton, but removing it did not begin until the turret arrived at the Mariners' Museum for conservation.

Many more were built, including [[river monitor]]s, and they played key roles in Civil War battles on the Mississippi and James Rivers. The [[breastwork monitor]] was developed during the 1860s by Sir [[Edward James Reed|Edward Reed]], [[Director of Naval Construction|Chief Constructor]] of the [[Royal Navy]], as an improvement of the basic Monitor design. Reed gave these ships a superstructure to increase seaworthiness and raise the freeboard of the gun turrets so they could be worked in all weathers. The superstructure was armored to protect the bases of the turrets, the funnels and the ventilator ducts in what he termed a [[breastwork (fortification)|breastwork]]. The ships were conceived as harbor defense ships with little need to leave port. Reed took advantage of the lack of masts and designed the ships with one twin-gun turret at each end of the superstructure, each able to turn and fire in a 270\u00b0 arc.<ref>[[#Parkes|Parkes, 1990]], p. 166</ref> These ships were described by Admiral [[George Alexander Ballard]] as being like \"full-armoured knights riding on donkeys, easy to avoid but bad to close with\".<ref>[[#Ballard|Ballard, 1980]], p. 219</ref> Reed later developed the design into the {{sclass-|Devastation|ironclad|4}}, the first ocean-going [[turret ship]]s without masts, the direct ancestors of the [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s and the [[dreadnought]]s.<ref>[[#Chesneau|Chesneau & Kolesnik, 1979]], p. 23</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|American Civil War|right=yes}}\n*[[Bibliography of early American naval history#American Civil War|Bibliography of American Civil War naval history]]\n*[[List of monitors of the United States Navy]]\n*[[List of National Historic Landmarks in North Carolina]]\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Dare County, North Carolina]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notes|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |title=Harriet Tubman, Secret Agent: How Daring Slaves and Free Blacks Spied for the Union During the Civil War |last=Allen |first=Thomas B. |ref=Allen |publisher=National Geographic Books |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4263-0401-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/harriettubmansec00alle }} 191 pages.\n*{{cite book |title=By Sea and by River: The Naval History of the Civil War |last=Anderson |first=Bern |ref=Anderson |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-306-80367-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/byseabyrivernava0000ande }} 303 pages.\n* {{cite book|last=Ballard |first=G.

While manned by Union Navy officers and enlisted personnel and supervised by the [[United States Department of the Navy]], but however the construction of the [[Western Gunboat Flotilla]] in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] cruising and operating along the rivers of the southern [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and was funded by the [[War Department (US)|U.S. War Department]], and at her commissioning the ''Carondelet'' was [[Union Army]] ([[United States Army]]) owned, rather than [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] property.<ref>[[#Silverstone|Silverstone, 2006]], pp. 109, 112.</ref>}} ''Monitor'' played a central role in the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] on 9 March 1862, where, under the command of Lieutenant [[John Lorimer Worden|John L. Worden]], she fought the [[casemate ironclad]] {{ship|CSS|Virginia}} (built on the hull of the [[scuttled]] [[steam frigate]] {{USS|Merrimack|1855|6}}) to a standstill. The unique design of the ship, distinguished by its [[gun turret|revolving turret]] which was designed by American inventor [[Theodore Timby]], was quickly duplicated and established the [[Monitor (warship)|monitor class and type]] of armored steam-powered warship built for the American Navy in the next several decades.\n\nThe remainder of the ship was designed by the Swedish-born engineer and inventor [[John Ericsson]], and hurriedly built in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] on the [[East River (New York)|East River]] beginning in late 1861 in only 101 days. ''Monitor'' presented a new concept in ship design and employed a variety of new inventions and innovations in ship building that caught the attention of the world. The impetus to build ''Monitor'' was prompted by the news that the Confederates were building an iron-plated armored vessel, named the ''Virginia'', in the old Federal naval shipyard at [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard|Gosport]], near [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], that could effectively engage the Union ships blockading [[Hampton Roads]] harbor and the [[James River]] leading northwest to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] (capital of the Confederacy), and ultimately advance on [[Washington, D.C.]] up the [[Potomac River]] and other seacoast cities, virtually unchallenged. Before ''Monitor'' could reach Hampton Roads, the Confederate ironclad had already destroyed the sail [[frigate]]s {{USS|Cumberland|1842|6}} and {{USS|Congress|1841|6}} and had run the steam frigate {{USS|Minnesota|1855|6}} [[Ship grounding|aground]]. That night ''Monitor'' arrived and the following morning, just as ''Virginia'' set to finish off ''Minnesota'' and ''St. Lawrence'' on the second day, the new Union ironclad confronted the Confederate ship, preventing her from wreaking further destruction on the wooden Union ships. A four-hour battle ensued, both ships pounding the other with close-range cannon fire, although neither ship could destroy or seriously damage the other. This was the first-ever battle fought between armored warships and marked a turning point in naval warfare.\n\nAfter the Confederates were forced to scuttle and destroy ''Virginia'' as they withdrew in early May 1862 from Norfolk and its naval shipyard, ''Monitor'' sailed up the James River to support the Union Army during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] under General-in-Chief [[George B. McClellan]]. The ship participated in the [[Battle of Drewry's Bluff]] later that month and remained in the area giving support to General McClellan's forces on land until she was ordered to join the [[Union blockade|Union Navy blockaders]] off North Carolina in December. On her way there she [[Shipwrecking#Instability and foundering|foundered]] while under tow, during a storm off [[Cape Hatteras]] on the last day of the year. ''Monitor''{{'}}s wreck was discovered in 1973 and has been partially [[Marine salvage|salvaged]]. Her guns, [[gun turret]], engine and other relics are on display at the [[Mariners' Museum]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]], a few miles from the site of its most important military action.\n\n== Conception ==\n\nWhile the concept of ships protected by armor existed before the advent of the ironclad ''Monitor'',<ref name=Bennett212>[[#Bennett|Bennett, 1900]], pp. 212\u2013213.</ref> the need for iron plating on ship arose only after the explosive [[shell (projectile)|shell]]-firing [[Paixhans gun]] was introduced to naval warfare in the 1820s. The use of heavy iron plating on the sides of warships was not practical until steam propulsion matured enough to carry its great weight. Developments in gun technology had progressed by the 1840s so that no practical thickness of wood could withstand the power of a shell.<ref>[[#Baxter|Baxter, 1933]], pp. 3\u20139.</ref> In response, the United States began construction in 1854 of a steam-powered ironclad warship, ''[[Stevens Battery]]'',<ref name=Gardiner50>[[#Gardiner|Gardiner, 1992]], pp. 50\u201355.</ref> but work was delayed and the designer, [[Robert L. Stevens|Robert Stevens]], died in 1856, stalling further work. Since there was no pressing need for such a ship at the time, there was little demand to continue work on the unfinished vessel.<ref>[[#Konstam2|Konstam, 2002]], p. 12.</ref> It was France that introduced the first operational armored ships as well as the first shell guns and rifled cannons.<ref name=Bennett64>[[#Bennett|Bennett, 1900]], p. 64.</ref> Experience during the [[Crimean War]] of 1854\u20131855 showed that armored ships could withstand repeated hits without significant damage when French ironclad [[floating batteries]] defeated Russian coastal fortifications during the [[Battle of Kinburn (1855)|Battle of Kinburn]]. Ericsson claimed to have sent the French [[Emperor]] [[Napol\u00e9on III]] a proposal for a monitor-type design, with a gun turret, in September 1854, but no record of any such submission could be found in the archives of the French Ministry of the Navy (''[[Ministre de la Marine]]'') when they were searched by naval historian [[James Phinney Baxter III]].<ref>[[#Baxter|Baxter, 1933]], pp. 184\u2013185.</ref> The French followed those ships with the first ocean-going ironclad, the [[armored frigate]] {{ship|French ironclad|Gloire||2}} in 1859, and the British responded with {{HMS|Warrior|1860|6}}.<ref name=Gardiner50/>\n\nThe [[Union Navy]]'s attitude towards ironclads changed quickly when it was learned that the Confederates were converting the captured {{USS|Merrimack|1855|6}} to an ironclad at the naval shipyard in Norfolk, Virginia. Subsequently, the urgency of ''Monitor''{{'}}s completion and deployment to Hampton Roads was driven by fears of what the Confederate ironclad, now renamed ''Virginia'', would be capable of doing, not only to Union ships but to cities along the coast and riverfronts. Northern newspapers published daily accounts of the Confederates' progress in converting the ''Merrimack'' to an ironclad; this prompted the Union Navy to complete and deploy ''Monitor'' as soon as possible.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], p. 55.</ref>\n\nWord of ''Merrimack''{{'}}s reconstruction and conversion was confirmed in the North in late February 1862 when [[Mary Louvestre]] of Norfolk, a freed slave who worked as a housekeeper for one of the Confederate engineers working on ''Merrimack'',<ref>[[#cia|CIA: Historical Document: Black Dispatches'']].</ref> made her way through Confederate lines with news that the Confederates were building an ironclad warship. Concealed in her dress was a message from a Union sympathizer who worked in the Navy Yard warning that the former ''Merrimack'', renamed ''Virginia'' by the Confederates, was nearing completion.<ref>[[#Davis96|Davis, 1996]], pp. 214\u2013215.</ref>{{efn|Accounts vary. Some sources claim she stole and was carrying the ship's plans, rather than a letter from a third party.<ref>[[#Sutherland|Sutherland, 2004]], p. 70.</ref><ref name=Allen115/><ref name=Tomblin161/>}} Upon her arrival in Washington Mary managed to meet with [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] [[Gideon Welles]] and informed him that the Confederates were nearing the completion of their ironclad, which surprised Welles. Convinced by the papers Mary was carrying he had production of ''Monitor'' sped up. Welles later recorded in his memoirs that \"Mrs. Louveste encountered no small risk in bringing this information&nbsp;...\"<ref name=Allen115>[[#Allen|Allen, 2008]], pp. 115\u2013116.</ref><ref name=Tomblin161>[[#Tomblin|Tomblin, 2009]], p. 161</ref>\n\n==Approval==\n[[File:John Ericcson, designer of the USS Monitor) - Charles D. Fredricks & Co., \"Specialit\u00e9,\" 587 Broadway, New York LCCN2016646196.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|John Ericcson, designer of the USS Monitor]]\nAfter the United States received word of the construction of ''Virginia'', [[United States Congress|Congress]] appropriated $1.5&nbsp; million on 3 August 1861 to build one or more armored steamships. It also ordered the creation of a board to inquire into the various designs proposed for armored ships. The Union Navy advertised for proposals for \"iron-clad steam vessels of war\" on 7 August and Welles appointed three senior officers as the [[Ironclad Board]] the following day. Their task was to \"examine plans for the completion of iron-clad vessels\" and consider its costs.<ref name=r5>[[#Roberts99|Roberts, 1999]], p. 5</ref>{{efn|Members of the Ironclad board included Commodores [[Joseph Smith (1790\u20131877)|Joseph Smith]], [[Hiram Paulding]] and [[Charles Henry Davis|Charles H. Davis]]. The board lacked experienced shipbuilders but was compensated by the fact that two of the members had years of shipyard experience.<ref name=r5/>}}\n\nEricsson originally made no submission to the board, but became involved when [[Cornelius Bushnell]], the sponsor of the proposal that became the armored [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{USS|Galena|1862|6}}, needed to have his design reviewed by a [[naval architect|naval constructor]]. The board required a guarantee from Bushnell that his ship would float despite the weight of its armor<ref>[[#Roberts99|Roberts, 1999]], p. 7</ref> and [[Cornelius H. DeLamater]] of New York City recommended that Bushnell consult with his friend Ericsson.<ref>[[#Baxter|Baxter, 1933]], p. 253</ref> The two first met on 9 September and again on the following day, after Ericsson had time to evaluate ''Galena''{{'}}s design. During this second meeting, Ericsson showed Bushnell a model of his own design, the future ''Monitor'', derived from his 1854 design. Bushnell got Ericsson's permission to show the model to Welles, who told Bushnell to show it to the board.<ref name=t4/> Upon review of Ericsson's unusual design, the board was skeptical, concerned that such a vessel would not float, especially in rough seas, and rejected the proposal of a completely iron laden ship. [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]], who had also examined the design, overruled them. Ericsson assured the board his ship would float exclaiming, \"The sea shall ride over her and she shall live in it like a duck\".<ref name=\"Ward-p99\">[[#Ward|Ward, Burns and Burns, 1990]], p. 99</ref> On 15 September, after further deliberations, the board accepted Ericsson's proposal.<ref name=t4>[[#Thompson90|Thompson, 1990]], p. 224</ref> The Ironclad Board evaluated 17 different designs, but recommended only three for procurement on 16 September, including Ericsson's ''Monitor'' design.<ref>[[#Roberts99|Roberts, 1999]], pp. 7, 16\u201317</ref>\n\nThe three ironclad ships selected differed substantially in design and degree of risk. ''Monitor'' was the most innovative design by virtue of its low [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]], shallow[[draft (hull)|-draft]] iron hull, and total dependence on steam power. The riskiest element of its design was its rotating [[gun turret]], something that had not previously been tested by any navy.{{efn|British trials of a turret designed by [[Cowper Phipps Coles|Cowper Coles]] on board the [[floating battery]] [[Aetna-class ironclad floating battery|HMS ''Trusty'']] began the same month.<ref>Brown, pp. 41\u201343</ref>}} Ericsson's guarantee of delivery in 100 days proved to be decisive in choosing his design despite the risk involved.<ref name=r711>[[#Roberts99|Roberts, 1999]], pp. 7\u201311</ref>\n\n==Design and description==\n[[File:Monitor model2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Model of USS ''Monitor'']]\n[[File:USS Monitor plans.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Inboard plans of USS ''Monitor''|Inboard plans of USS ''Monitor'']]\n\n''Monitor'' was an unusual vessel in almost every respect and was sometimes sarcastically described by the press and other critics as \"Ericsson's folly\", \"cheesebox on a raft\"<ref>[[#Thulesius|Thulesius, 2007]], pp. 108, 113</ref><ref>[[#Bushnell|Bushnell, Ericsson, Welles, 1899]], pp. 17, 41</ref> and the \"Yankee cheesebox\".<ref>[[#McCordock|McCordock, 1938]], p. 103</ref> The most prominent feature on the vessel was a large cylindrical gun turret mounted [[amidships]] above the low-freeboard upper [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]], also called the \"raft\". This extended well past the sides of the lower, more traditionally shaped hull.

In a letter dated 27 April 1862 Lieutenant Commander O.C. Badger wrote to Lieutenant H. A. Wise, Assistant Inspector of Ordnance, advising the use of \"liquid fire\", scalding water from the boiler through hoses and pipes, sprayed out via the vents and pilothouse window, to repel enemy boarders.<ref>[[#Rawson|Rawson, 1898]], pp. 285\u201386.</ref> Wise who was aboard and inspected ''Monitor'' after the battle responded in a letter of 30 April 1862: \"With reference to the Monitor, the moment I jumped on board of her after the fight I saw that a steam tug with twenty men could have taken the upper part of her in as many seconds&nbsp;...

Six days later, Ericsson signed a contract with Bushnell, [[John F. Winslow]] and [[John Augustus Griswold|John A.

There was one major delay, however, over the signing of the actual contract with the government.<ref>[[#Baxter|Baxter, 1968]], pp. 258\u201359</ref> Welles insisted that if ''Monitor'' did not prove to be a \"complete success\", the builders would have to refund every cent to the government.<ref>[[#McPherson|McPherson, 1988]], pp. 374\u2013375</ref> Winslow balked at this draconian provision and had to be persuaded by his partners to sign after the Navy rejected his attempt to amend the contract.

Rowland of the Continental Iron Works at [[Bushwick Inlet]] (in modern-day [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]]) on 25 October for construction of ''Monitor''{{'}}s hull. Her [[keel]] was laid the same day.

Valve problems with the main engine and one of the fan engines prevented her from reaching the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] from Bushwick Inlet and she had to be towed there the next day. These issues were easily fixed and ''Monitor'' was ordered to sail for Hampton Roads on 26 February, but her departure had to be delayed one day to load ammunition. On the morning of 27 February the ship entered the [[East River]] preparatory to leaving New York, but proved to be all but unsteerable and had to be towed back to the navy yard. Upon examination, the steering gear controlling the [[rudder]] had been improperly installed and Rowland offered to realign the rudder, which he estimated to take only a day. Ericsson, however, preferred to revise the steering gear by adding an extra set of [[pulley]]s as he believed it would take less time. His modification proved to be successful during trials on 4 March.<ref name=\"Thompson p. 237\"/><ref>[[#Bennett|Bennett, 1900]], p. 119</ref><ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 27\u201328</ref> Gunnery trials were successfully performed the previous day, although Stimers twice nearly caused disasters as he did not understand how the [[recoil]] mechanism worked on Ericsson's [[gun carriage|carriage]] for the 11-inch guns.

The entire crew were given goat-skin mats to sleep on. Lighting for each living area was provided by small skylights in the deck above, which were covered by an iron hatch during battle. The officer's wardroom was located forward of the berth deck where officers would eat their meals, hold meetings or socialize during what little spare time they had.

In particular the correspondence of [[George Spencer Geer|George S.

First Assistant Engineer Isaac Newton ordered the engine room abandoned and had the able-bodied crew drag the afflicted engine room hands to the top of the turret where the fresh air could revive them.<ref name=Konstam40/> Both Newton and Stimers worked desperately to get the blowers to work, but they too succumbed to the noxious fumes and were taken above.<ref>[[#Baxter|Baxter, 1968]], p. 289</ref> One [[fireman (steam engine)|fireman]] was able to punch a hole in the fan box, drain the water, and restart the fan.

''Monitor'' was now in danger of [[Shipwrecking|foundering]], so Worden signaled ''Seth Low'' for help and had ''Monitor'' towed to calmer waters closer to shore so she was able to restart her engines later that evening.

When the temperamental Stanton learned that ''Monitor'' had only two guns he expressed contempt and rage as he paced back and forth, further increasing the anxiety and despair among members of the meeting. Assurances from Admiral Dahlgren and other officers that ''Virginia'' was too massive to effectively approach Washington and that ''Monitor'' was capable of the challenge offered him no consolation. After further deliberations Lincoln was finally assured but Stanton remained almost in a state of terror and sent telegrams to various governors and mayors of the coastal states warning them of the danger.<ref>[[#Baxter|Baxter, 1933]], p. 297</ref><ref>[[#Welles|Welles Diary]], Vol. I, p. 65</ref> Subsequently, Stanton approved a plan to load some sixty canal boats with stone and gravel and sink them in the Potomac, but Welles was able to convince Lincoln at the last moment that such a plan would only prevent ''Monitor'' and other Union ships from reaching Washington and that the barges should only be sunk if and when ''Virginia'' was able to make her way up the Potomac.<ref>[[#Welles|Welles Diary]], Vol. I, p. 66</ref>\n\nAbout 9:00&nbsp;pm, ''Monitor'' finally arrived on the scene only to discover the destruction that ''Virginia'' had already wrought on the Union fleet. Worden was ordered upon reaching Hampton Roads to anchor alongside {{USS|Roanoke|1855|6}} and report to Captain [[John Marston (sailor)|John Marston]] where Worden was briefed of the situation and received further orders to protect the grounded ''Minnesota''.<ref>[[#Quarstein99|Quarstein, 1999]], p. 77</ref><ref>[[#Field|Field, 2011]], p. 44</ref> By midnight, under the cover of darkness, ''Monitor'' quietly pulled up alongside and behind the ''Minnesota'' and waited.<ref name=Wagner553>[[#Wagner|Wagner, 2002]], p. 553</ref>\n\n====Duel of the ironclads====\nThe next morning at about 6:00&nbsp;am ''Virginia'', accompanied by {{ship|CSS|Jamestown||2}}, {{ship|CSS|Patrick Henry||2}} and {{ship|CSS|Teaser||2}}, got underway from [[Sewell's Point]] to finish off ''Minnesota'' and the rest of the blockaders, but were delayed sailing out into Hampton Roads because of heavy fog until about 8:00&nbsp;am.<ref>[[#Quarstein99|Quarstein, 1999]], p. 78</ref> In ''Monitor'' Worden was already at his station in the pilot house while Greene took command of the turret.<ref name=Still18>[[#Still|Still, 1988]], p. 18</ref> Samuel Howard, Acting Master of ''Minnesota'', who was familiar with Hampton Roads with its varying depths and shallow areas, had volunteered to be the pilot the night before and thus was accepted, while Quarter Master [[Peter Williams (Medal of Honor)|Peter Williams]] steered the vessel throughout the battle (Williams was later awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for this act).<ref>[[#Field|Field, 2011]], pp. 38, 46</ref><ref>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], pp. 181, 191</ref> The speaking tube used to communicate between the pilothouse and the turret had broken early in the action so Keeler and Toffey had to relay commands from Worden to Greene.<ref name=Quarstein78>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 78</ref><ref name=Greene/> As ''Virginia'' approached, she began firing at ''Minnesota'' from more than a mile away, a few of her shells hitting the vessel. When the firing was heard in the distance, Greene sent Keeler to the pilot house for permission to open fire as soon as possible where Worden ordered,<ref name=Still18/><ref name=Hoehling155>[[#Hoehling|Hoehling, 1993]], p. 155</ref> \"Tell Mr. Greene not to fire till I give the word, to be cool and deliberate, to take sure aim and not waste a shot.\"<ref name=Hoehling155/>\n\n''Monitor'', to the surprise of ''Virginia''{{'}}s crew, had emerged from behind ''Minnesota'' and positioned herself between her and the grounded ship, preventing the Confederate ironclad from further engaging the vulnerable wooden ship at close range. At 8:45&nbsp;am Worden gave the order to fire where Greene fired the first shots of the battle between the two ironclads which harmlessly deflected off the Confederate ironclad. During the battle ''Monitor'' fired solid shot, about once every eight minutes, while ''Virginia'' fired shell exclusively.<ref>[[#Maclay|Maclay, 1894]], p. 314</ref> The ironclads fought, generally at close range, for about four hours, ending at 12:15&nbsp;pm,<ref>[[#Ward|Ward, Burns and Burns, 1990]], pp. 95, 101</ref>{{efn|Accounts vary, some claim the battle lasted no more than three and a half hours,<ref name=Tucker171/> while some claim as many as five hours.<ref>[[#Varhola|Varhola, 1999]], p. 221</ref>}} ranging from a few yards to more than a hundred. Both ships were constantly in motion, maintaining a circular pattern. Because of ''Virginia''{{'}}s weak engines, great size and weight, and a draft of {{convert|22|ft|m|abbr=on}}, she was slow and difficult to maneuver, taking her half an hour to complete a 180-degree turn.<ref>[[#McPherson|McPherson, 1988]], pp. 373\u201374</ref>\n\nDuring the engagement, ''Monitor''{{'}}s turret began to malfunction, making it extremely difficult to turn and stop at a given position, so the crew simply let the turret continuously turn and fired their guns \"on the fly\" as they bore on ''Virginia''. Several times, ''Monitor'' received direct hits on the turret, causing some bolts to violently shear off and ricochet around inside. The deafening sound of the impact stunned some of the crew, causing nose and ear bleeding.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 109\u2013111</ref><ref name=leckie211>[[#Leckie|Leckie, 1990]], p. 211</ref> However, neither vessel was able to sink or seriously damage the other. At one point, ''Virginia'' attempted to ram, but only struck ''Monitor'' a glancing blow and did no damage. The collision did, however, aggravate the damage to ''Virginia''{{'}}s bow from when she had previously rammed ''Cumberland''. ''Monitor'' was also unable to do significant damage to ''Virginia'', possibly because her guns were firing with reduced charges, on advice from Commander [[John Dahlgren]], the gun's designer, who lacked the \"preliminary information\" needed to determine what amount of charge was needed to \"pierce, dislocate or dislodge iron plates\" of various thicknesses and configurations.<ref name=\"Nelson, James L 2005 400 pages\"/><ref name=Dahlgren279>[[#Dahlgren|Dahlgren, 1882]], p. 279</ref>{{efn|In a letter of 19 March 1862, to Captain A.

With one of the gun port covers jammed shut, she hauled off to shallow waters to resupply the turret and repair the damaged hatch, which could not be fixed. During the lull in the battle, Worden climbed through the gun port out onto the deck to get a better view of the overall situation. ''Virginia'', seeing ''Monitor'' turn away, turned her attention to the ''Minnesota'' and fired shots that set the wooden vessel ablaze, also destroying the nearby [[tugboat]] ''Dragon''. When the turret was resupplied with ammunition, Worden returned to battle with only one gun able to fire.<ref name=Field56>[[#Field|Field, 2011]], p. 56</ref>\n\nTowards the end of the engagement, Worden directed Williams to steer ''Monitor'' around the stern of Confederate ironclad, where [[John Taylor Wood|Lieutenant Wood]] fired ''Virginia''{{'}}s 7-inch Brooke gun at ''Monitor''{{'}}s [[pilothouse]], striking the forward side directly beneath the sight hold, cracking the structural \"iron log\" along the base of the narrow opening just as Worden was peering out.<ref>[[#Field|Field, 2011]], pp. 36\u201337, 56\u201357</ref> Worden was heard to have cried out, ''My eyes\u2014I am blind!''

Jones demanded to know why and was briefed by Lieutenant [[John R. Eggleston|Eggleston]] that powder was low and precious and given ''Monitor''{{'}}s resistance to shot after two hours of battle, maintained that continued firing at that point would only be a waste of ammunition.<ref name=Tucker171>[[#Tucker|Tucker, 2006]], p. 171</ref> ''Virginia'' soon managed to break away and headed back towards Norfolk for needed repairs, believing that ''Monitor'' had withdrawn from battle. Greene did not pursue ''Virginia''<ref>[[#Still88|Still, 1988]], p. 7</ref> and, like Worden, was under orders to stay with and protect ''Minnesota'',<ref>[[#Holzer06|Holzer, Mulligan, 2006]], p. 101</ref> an action for which he was later criticized.\n\nAs a result of the duel between the two ironclads, ''Monitor'' had been struck twenty-two times, including nine hits to the turret and two hits to the pilothouse. She had managed to fire forty-one shots from her pair of Dahlgren guns. ''Virginia'' had sustained ninety-seven indentations to her armor from the fire of ''Monitor'' and other ships. Neither ship had sustained any significant damage. In the opinion of ''Virginia''{{'}}s commander Jones and her other officers, ''Monitor'' could have sunk their ship had she hit the vessel at the waterline.<ref name=\"Wilson32\"/><ref>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 79</ref>\n\nStrategically, the battle between these two ships was considered the most definitive naval battle of the Civil War. The battle itself was largely considered a draw, though it could be argued ''Virginia'' did slightly more damage.<ref name=Wilson32/> ''Monitor'' did successfully defend ''Minnesota'' and the rest of the Union blockading force, while ''Virginia'' was unable to complete the destruction she started the previous day. The battle between the two ironclads marked a turning point in the way naval warfare would be fought in the immediate future and beyond.<ref>[[#Konstam|Konstam, 2002]], p. 7</ref> Strategically, nothing had changed: the Union still controlled Hampton Roads and the Confederates still held several rivers and Norfolk,<ref>[[#Davis75|Davis, 1975]], p. 136</ref> making it a strategic victory for the North.

Hands, Acting Master Louis N. Stodder, Second Assistant Engineer Albert B. Campbell (seated) and Acting Volunteer Lieutenant William Flye (with binoculars).''Monitor'' on the [[James River]], Virginia, 9 July 1862]]\nImmediately following the battle Stimers telegraphed Ericsson, congratulating and thanking him for making it possible to confront the Confederate ironclad and for \"saving the day\". No sooner than ''Monitor'' had weighed anchor, numerous small boats and spectators on shore flocked around the ship to congratulate the crew for what they regarded as their victory over ''Virginia''. Assistant Secretary Fox, who observed the entire battle from aboard ''Minnesota'', came aboard ''Monitor'' and jokingly told her officers, \"Well gentlemen, you don't look as though you just went through one of the greatest naval conflicts on record\". A small tug soon came alongside and the blinded Worden was brought up from his cabin while crew members and spectators cheered. He was taken directly to Fort Monroe for preliminary treatment, then to a hospital in Washington shortly thereafter.<ref>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 71</ref>\n\nStimers and Newton soon began repairing the damage to the pilot house and reconfigured the sides from an upright position to a slope of thirty degrees to deflect the shot. During this time, Mrs. Worden personally brought news of her husband's progress and recovery and was optimistic, informing the crew his eyesight would soon return but he would be laid up for some time. She also informed them President Lincoln had personally paid Worden a visit extending his gratitude.<ref>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 97</ref> Worden was later taken to his summer home in New York and remained unconscious for three months.<ref>[[#Still88|Still, 1988]], p. 8</ref> He returned to Naval service in 1862 as captain of {{USS|Montauk|1862|6}}, another ''Monitor''-type ironclad.\n\nThe Confederates were also celebrating what they considered a victory, as crowds of spectators gathered along the banks of the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]], cheering and waving flags, handkerchiefs and hats as ''Virginia'', displaying the captured [[ensign]] of ''Congress'', passed along up the river. The Confederate government was ecstatic and immediately promoted Buchanan to Admiral.<ref>[[#Quarstein12|Quarstein, 2012]], p. 169</ref>\n\nBoth the Union and Confederacy soon came up with plans for defeating the other's ironclad. Oddly, these did not depend on their own ironclads. The Union Navy chartered a large ship (the [[Paddle steamer|sidewheeler]] {{USS|Vanderbilt|1862|6}}) and reinforced her bow with steel specifically to be used as a [[naval ram]], provided ''Virginia'' steamed far enough out into Hampton Roads.<ref>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 108</ref>\n\nOn 11 April, ''Virginia'', accompanied by a number of gunboats, steamed into Hampton Roads to Sewell's Point at the southeast edge, almost over to [[Newport News]], in a challenge to ''Monitor'' in an attempt to lure the Union ironclad into battle. ''Virginia'' fired a few shots ineffectively at very long range, while ''Monitor'' returned fire while remaining near Fort Monroe, ready to fight if ''Virginia'' came to attack the Federal force congregated there.<ref>[[#Bennett|Bennett, 1900]], pp. 136\u2013137</ref> Furthermore, ''Vanderbilt'' was in position to ram ''Virginia'' if she approached the fort. ''Virginia'' did not take the bait.<ref>[[#Broadwater|Broadwater, 2012]], p. 88</ref> In a further attempt to entice ''Monitor'' closer to the Confederate side, so she could be boarded, the James River Squadron moved in and captured three merchant ships, the brigs ''Marcus'' and ''Sabout'', and the schooner ''Catherine T. Dix''.<ref>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 109</ref> These had been grounded and abandoned when they sighted ''Virginia'' entering the Roads. Their flags were then hoisted \"[[Distress signal#Flags|Union-side down]]\" to taunt ''Monitor'' into a fight as they were towed back to Norfolk. In the end, both sides had failed to provoke a fight on their terms.<ref>[[#Anderson|Anderson, 1989]], pp. 77\u201378</ref>\n\nThe [[Confederate Navy]] originally had devised a plan where the [[James River Squadron]] would swarm ''Monitor'' with a party of men with the intention of capturing the vessel by boarding and disabling her by using heavy hammers to drive iron wedges under and disabling the turret and by covering the pilothouse with a wet sail effectively blinding the pilot. Others would throw combustibles down the ventilation openings and smoke holes. At one point Jones made such an attempt to board the vessel but she managed to slip away around the stern of ''Virginia'' in time.<ref name=\"Field56\"/>\n\nA second meeting occurred on 8 May, when ''Virginia'' came out while ''Monitor'' and four other Federal ships bombarded Confederate batteries at Sewell's Point. The Federal ships retired slowly to Fort Monroe, hoping to lure ''Virginia'' into the Roads. She did not follow, however, and after firing a gun to windward as a sign of contempt, anchored off Sewell's Point. Later, when Confederate forces abandoned Norfolk on 11 May 1862, they were forced to destroy ''Virginia''.<ref>[[#Quarstein12|Quarstein, 2012]], p. 15</ref>\n\n===Battle of Drewry's Bluff===\n[[File:Battle of Drewry's Bluff.jpg|thumb|alt=|Engraving of [[Battle of Drewry's Bluff]]]]\n{{main|Battle of Drewry's Bluff}}\nAfter the destruction of ''Virginia'', ''Monitor'' was free to assist the [[Union Army]] and [[George B. McClellan|General McClellan's]] campaign against Richmond. As the Navy always gave command to officers based on seniority, Greene was replaced with Lieutenant [[Thomas O. Selfridge]] the day after the battle. Two days later, Selfridge was in turn relieved by Lieutenant [[William Nicholson Jeffers]] on 15 May 1862.<ref>[[#Davis75|Davis, 1975]], p. 147</ref><ref name=Fuller178>[[#Fuller|Fuller, 2008]], p. 178</ref> ''Monitor'' was now part of a flotilla under the command of Admiral [[John Rodgers (American Civil War naval officer)|John Rodgers]] aboard ''Galena'', and, along with three other gunboats, steamed up the James River and engaged the Confederate batteries at [[Drewry's Bluff]]. The force had instructions to coordinate their efforts with McClellan's forces on land and push on towards Richmond to bombard the city into surrender if possible. Without any assistance, the task force got within {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} of the Confederate capital but could not proceed further because of sunken vessels and debris placed in the river that blocked further passage. There were also artillery batteries at [[Fort Darling]] overlooking and guarding the approach, along with other heavy guns and sharpshooters positioned along the river banks. The fort was strategically situated on the west bank of the James River atop of a [[Hill|bluff]] some {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=on}} above and overlooking the bend in the river.<ref name=Fuller178/><ref name=Stern90>[[#Stern|Stern, 1962]], p. 90</ref> ''Monitor'' was of little help in the assault because the confinement and small gun ports of her turret would not allow her to elevate her guns sufficiently to engage the Confederate batteries at close range, so she had to fall back and fire at a greater distance,<ref name=Stern90/> while the other gunboats were unable to overcome the fortifications on their own.<ref name=\"Nelson, James L 2005 400 pages\"/> After ''Monitor'' received only a few hits, without incurring any damage, the Confederates, many of whom were former crew members of ''Virginia'' well aware of her ability to withstand cannon shot even at close range,<ref>[[#McCordock|McCordock, 1938]], p. 349</ref> concentrated their guns on the other ships, especially ''Galena'', which sustained considerable damage and moderate casualties.<ref name=Stern90/> After a near four-hour artillery duel and sustaining numerous hits overall, the flotilla was unable to neutralize the fortification and had to turn back.<ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner, Galleghar, Finkelman, 2002]], p. 530</ref> Not a single Union ship reached Richmond until near the end of the war, when the city was finally evacuated by the Confederates.<ref name=Stern90/><ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner, Galleghar, Finkelman, 2002]], p. 574</ref>\n\n[[File:USSMonitor1862.4.ws.jpg |thumb|1862 picture of USS ''Monitor'' crew; the African American crewman in the right foreground is Siah Carter<ref>[http://www.navsource.org/archives/01/monitor.htm Navsource archives]</ref>]]\nAfter the battle at Drewry's Bluff ''Monitor'' remained on the James River providing support, along with the ''Galena'' and other gunboats, to McClellan's troops at various points along the river including [[Harrison's Landing]]<ref name=Quarstein149>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], pp. 149\u2013150</ref>\n<ref>[[#Tucker06|Tucker, 2006]], p. 182</ref> which ended in August. However most of the time spent on the river was marked with inactivity and hot weather which had a negative effect on the morale of ''Monitor''{{'}}s crew. During the long, hot, summer, several crew members became sick and were transferred to Hampton Roads while various officers were replaced including Newton, while Jeffers was replaced by Commander [[Thomas H. Stevens, Jr.]]{{efn|Stevens previously served as commander of {{USS|Maratanza|1861|6}}.<ref name=Quarstein149/>}} on 15 August. By the end of August, ''Monitor'' was ordered back to Hampton Roads and dropped anchor nearby the sunken ''Cumberland'' at Newport News Point on 30 August, much to the approval of the crew. ''Monitor''{{'}}s sole purpose now was to blockade the James River from any advances made by the newly constructed {{ship|CSS|Virginia II||2}}, an ironclad ram.<ref name=Quarstein149/>\n\n===Repairs and refit===\nIn September Captain [[John P.

''Monitor'' was now a premier tourist attraction and the crowd was soon allowed on board to tour the vessel.<ref>[[#Quarsstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], pp. 155\u2013156</ref> During this time the vessel was picked clean of artifacts for souvenirs by the touring civilians that came aboard. When Stodder and others came to close up the dock and ship one evening Stodder noted, \"When we came up to clean that night there was not a key, doorknob, [[Escutcheon (furniture)|escutcheon]] \u2013 there wasn't a thing that hadn't been carried away.\"<ref>[[#Quarstein06|Quarstein, 2006]], p. 241</ref>\n\nBefore ''Monitor'' was put into [[dry dock]] for repairs, Lincoln, Fox, various officials and a few of Worden's close friends arrived to ceremoniously review the vessel and pay respect to the crew and former commander Worden, who after a long and partial recovery arrived for the occasion. Entire army regiments were also directed to come by the navy yard and review the ship and honor the crew. ''Monitor''{{'}}s crew assembled on deck in formation with their officers in front, while Lincoln, Fox and other guests stood near the turret. When Worden, with part of his face blackened from the wounds he received at Hampton Roads, came aboard, the heavy guns in the navy yard were fired in [[Salute#Heavy arms: gun salutes|salute]]. Lincoln came forward and greeted Worden and then introduced him to some of the others. After his formal greeting the crew swarmed around Worden and embraced and shook hands with their former commander and thanked God for his recovery and return. Worden called each of them by name and spoke friendly to and complimented each of them personally. When order was restored the President gave a short speech about Worden's career. At Fox's request, Worden gave a speech to the gathering about his voyage from New York to Hampton Roads, the trials they were faced with along the way and of the great battle between ''Monitor'' and ''Virginia'', while paying [[tribute]] to many of the officers and men involved. In closing he gave special thanks to Ericsson, Lincoln, Welles and all who made construction of ''Monitor'' possible.<ref name=Nelson323>[[#Nelson2009|Nelson, 2009]], p. 323</ref><ref>[[#Worden|Worden, Greene, 1912]], pp. 1\u20136, 21\u201322</ref>\n\nWhile ''Monitor'' was undergoing repairs her crew was put aboard {{USS|King Philip|1845|6}} and were eventually granted a furlough by Bankhead who himself went on leave.<ref>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 156</ref> For approximately six weeks the vessel remained in dry dock while her bottom was scraped clean, the engines and boilers were overhauled, the entire vessel was cleaned and painted, and a number of improvements made, including an iron shield around the top of the turret.<ref name=Bankhead/> To make the vessel more seaworthy, a {{convert|30|ft|m|0|adj=on}} funnel-shaped [[smokestack]] was placed over the smoke outlet while taller fresh air vents were installed. The [[berth deck]] below was also enlarged and raised by removing some of the side storerooms and placing them below, thus reducing the height of the interior which now barely allowed the crew to stand upright. Several cranes were also added while interior improvements were made making the confining environment more livable. A large blower that operated with its own engine was installed which drew fresh air down through the pilothouse. During this time the two Dahlgren guns were each engraved with large letters, ''MONITOR & MERRIMAC \u2013 WORDEN'' and ''MONITOR & MERRIMAC \u2013 ERICSSON'', respectively.{{efn|In the actual engravings the men's names are inscribed below those of the ships' names. e.g. MONITOR & MERRIMA WORDEN}} Additional iron plates were installed covering the dents from the previous battles.

By November the ship was fully repaired and ready to return to service.<ref name=Bankhead/><ref>[[#Still88|Still, 1988]], p. 67</ref>\n\n=== Final voyage ===\n[[File:USS Monitor - H58758.jpg|thumb|alt=|Engraving of USS&nbsp;''Monitor'' sinking, with {{USS|Rhode Island|1860|6}} in the background]]\n\nOn 24 December 1862, orders were issued directing ''Monitor'' to [[Beaufort, North Carolina]] to join {{USS|Passaic|1862|6}} and {{USS|Montauk|1862|6}} for a joint Army-Navy expedition against Wilmington, North Carolina, where she would join the blockade off [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. The orders were received by the crew on Christmas Day, some of whom had been aboard ''Monitor'' on her harrowing journey from New York to Hampton Roads in March and were not pleased with the prospect of taking to the high seas once again. Dana Greene remarked, \"I do not consider this steamer a sea going vessel\".<ref>[[#Quarstein99|Quarstein, 1999]], p. 121</ref>\n\nThe crew celebrated Christmas aboard ''Monitor'' while berthed at Hampton Roads in what was described as a most merry fashion, while many other celebrations were occurring along the shore. The ship's cook was paid one dollar to prepare a meal for the crew befitting the day; it was received with mixed opinion. That day, ''Monitor'' was made ready for sea, her crew under strict orders not to discuss the impending voyage with anyone, but bad weather delayed her departure until 29 December.<ref name=\"Quarstein-p106\">[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 106</ref>\n\nWhile the design of ''Monitor'' was well-suited for river combat, her low freeboard and heavy turret made her highly unseaworthy in rough waters. Under the command of [[John P. Bankhead]], ''Monitor'' put to sea on 31 December, under tow from the steamship {{USS|Rhode Island|1860|6}}, as a heavy storm developed off [[Cape Hatteras|Cape Hatteras, North Carolina]]. Using chalk and a blackboard, Bankhead wrote messages alerting ''Rhode Island'' that if ''Monitor'' needed help she would signal with a red lantern.<ref name=Quarstein171>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 171</ref>\n\n''Monitor'' was soon in trouble as the storm increased in ferocity. Large waves were splashing over and completely covering the deck and pilot house so the crew temporarily rigged the wheel atop the turret which was manned by helmsman Francis Butts.<ref>[[#Thulesius|Thulesius, 2007]], p. 136</ref> Water continued flooding into the vents and ports and the ship began rolling uncontrollably in the high seas. Sometimes she would drop into a wave with such force the entire hull would tremble. Leaks were beginning to appear everywhere. Bankhead ordered the engineers to start the [[Worthington pump]]s, which temporarily stemmed the rising waters, but soon ''Monitor'' was hit by a squall and a series of violent waves and water continued to work its way into the vessel. Right when the Worthington pump could no longer keep pace with the flooding, a call came from the engine room that water was gaining there. Realizing the ship was in serious trouble, Bankhead signaled ''Rhode Island'' for help and hoisted the red lantern next to ''Monitor''{{'}}s white running light atop the turret. He then ordered the anchor dropped to stop the ship's rolling and pitching with little effect, making it no easier for the rescue boats to get close enough to receive her crew. He then ordered the towline cut and called for volunteers,<ref>[[#Quarstein10|Quarstein, 2010]], p. 172</ref> Stodder, along with crewmates John Stocking,<ref>His real name was Wells Wentz; see [https://www.usni.org/magazines/naval-history-magazine/2013/may/lost-men-monitor US Naval Institute Magazine 2013]-thus he is listed under his real name in the USS Monitor Cenopath memorial gravestone</ref> and James Fenwick volunteered and climbed down from the turret, but eyewitnesses said that as soon as they were on the deck Fenwick and Stocking were quickly swept overboard and drowned. Stodder managed to hang onto the safety lines around the deck and finally cut through the {{convert|13|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} towline with a hatchet.<ref>[[#Mariner30|Mariner's Museum, Article: The Last Voyage of the USS Monitor]]</ref> At 11:30&nbsp;pm.

In his official report of ''Monitor'' to the Navy Department, Bankhead praised Greene and Stodder for their heroic efforts and wrote, \"I would beg leave to call the attention of the Admiral and of the Department of the particularly good conduct of Lieutenant Greene and Acting Master Louis N. Stodder, who remained with me until the last, and by their example did much toward inspiring confidence and obedience on the part of the others.\"<ref name=\"Still, 1988, p. 20\"/>\n\nAfter a frantic rescue effort, ''Monitor'' finally foundered and sank approximately {{convert|16|mi|km}} southeast off Cape Hatteras with the loss of sixteen men,<ref>{{cite web |title=USS Monitor |url=https://monitor.noaa.gov/shipwrecks/uss_monitor.html |website=monitor.noaa.gov |publisher=Monitor National Marine Sanctuary |accessdate=3 July 2019 |language=English |quote=In the end, 16 of the brave men onboard the Monitor never met the year of 1863.}}</ref> including four officers, some of whom remained in the turret and went down with the ironclad.

Bankhead, 2013]]</ref> After his initial recovery, Bankhead filed his official report, as did the commanding officers of the ''Rhode Island'', stating officers and men of both ''Monitor'' and ''Rhode Island'' did everything within their ability to keep ''Monitor'' from sinking. The Navy did not find it necessary to commission a board of inquiry to investigate the affair and took no action against Bankhead or any of his officers.<ref>[[#Broadwater|Broadwater, 2012]], p. 14</ref>\n\nSome time later a controversy emerged over why ''Monitor'' sank. In the ''Army and Navy Journal'', Ericsson accused the crew of drunkenness during the storm, being consequently unable to prevent the vessel from sinking. Stodder vigorously defended the crew and rebuked Ericsson's characterization of the crew and events and wrote to Pierce that Ericsson \"covers up defects by blaming those that are now dead\", pointing out that there were a number of unavoidable events and circumstances that led to the ship's sinking, foremost being the overhang between the upper and lower hulls which came loose and partially separated during the storm from slamming into the violent waves. Stodder's account was corroborated by other shipmates.<ref>[[#Mindell|Mindell, 2000]], p. 140</ref>\n\n==Rediscovery==\nThe Navy tested an \"underwater locator\" in August 1949 by searching an area south of the [[Cape Hatteras Light]]house for the wreck of ''Monitor''. It found a {{convert|140|ft|m|1|adj=on}} long object bulky enough to be a shipwreck, in {{convert|310|ft|m|1}} of water that was thought to be ''Monitor'', but powerful currents negated attempts by divers to investigate.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], p. 32</ref> Retired [[Rear Admiral]] [[Edward Ellsberg]] proposed using external [[pontoon (boat)|pontoon]]s to raise the wreck in 1951, the same method of [[marine salvage]] he had used on the sunken [[submarine]] {{USS|S-51|SS-162|2}}, for the cost of $250,000.<ref>[[#Harvard51|Harvard Journal, April 1951]]</ref> Four years later, [[Robert F. Marx]] claimed to have discovered the wreck based on the idea she had drifted into shallow water north of the [[lighthouse]] before sinking. Marx said he had dived on the wreck and placed a Coke bottle with his name on it in one of the gun barrels, although he never provided any proof of his story.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 32\u201333</ref>\n\nInterest in locating the ship revived in the early 1970s and [[Duke University]], the [[National Geographic Society]] and the [[National Science Foundation]] sponsored an expedition in August 1973 to search for the wreck using a towed [[sonar]] system. The Duke team was led by John G. Newton<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://monitor.noaa.gov/150th/discovery.html | title=Monitor 150th Anniversary - Discovery of the Monitor}}</ref> (no known relation to the Isaac Newton that served on the Monitor). On 27 August, ''Monitor'' was discovered 111 years after sinking, near [[Cape Hatteras]] at coordinates {{Coord|35|0|6|N|75|24|23|W|display=inline,title}}. They sent a camera down to photograph the wreck, but the pictures were so fuzzy as to be useless; on a second attempt the camera snagged something on the wreck and was lost. The sonar images did not match what they expected the wreck to look like until they realized that the sinking vessel had turned over while descending and was resting at the bottom upside down. The team announced their discovery on 8 March 1974. Another expedition was mounted that same month to confirm the discovery and the research [[submersible]] ''[[Alcoa Sea Probe]]'' was able to take still photos and video of the wreck that confirmed it was ''Monitor''.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 34\u201337</ref>\n\nThese photos revealed that the wreck was disintegrating and the discovery raised another issue. Since the Navy had formally abandoned the wreck in 1953, it could be exploited by divers and private salvage companies as it lay outside North Carolina's territorial limits.{{efn|\"Research and case law in the 1970s and 1980s determined that the U.S. Navy abandonment of the USS ''Monitor'' consisted only of striking the vessel from the [[Navy List]], an action more accurately described as a decision to 'surplus' ships, not a legal abandonment of the warship as an item of federal property. In fact, aside from express authority from Congress, the act of abandonment is outside the authority of any agency, including the Navy. The Navy can decommission a ship, but must follow 'surplus property' procedures administered by the [[General Services Administration]] to actually dispose of the ship.\"<ref>[[#Broadwater|Broadwater, 2012]], p. 62</ref>}} To preserve the ship, the wreck, and everything around it, a {{convert|.5|nmi|lk=in|adj=on}} radius was designated as the [[Monitor National Marine Sanctuary]], the first U.S. [[marine sanctuary]], on 30 January 1975.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 37\u201338</ref> ''Monitor'' was also designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] on 23 June 1986.<ref>[[#Broadwater|Broadwater, 2012]], p. 91</ref>\n\n[[File:USS Monitor Anchor.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Photo showing anchor of the Monitor at the Mariner's Museum|USS ''Monitor'' anchor at the Mariners' Museum]]\nIn 1977, scientists were finally able to view the wreckage in person as the submersible ''[[Johnson Sea Link]]'' was used to inspect it. The ''Sea Link'' was able to ferry divers down to the sunken vessel and retrieve small artifacts.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 38\u201340</ref> U.S. Navy interest in raising the entire ship ended in 1978 when Captain [[Willard Franklyn Searle|Willard F. Searle Jr.]] calculated the cost and possible damage expected from the operation: $20&nbsp;million to stabilize the vessel in place, or as much as $50&nbsp;million to bring all of it to the surface.<ref name=orlando1998>[[#Erickson98|Erickson, 1998]], part 5 of 5, p. 2</ref> Research continued and artifacts continued to be recovered, including the ship's {{convert|1500|lb|adj=on}} anchor in 1983. The growing number of relics required conservation and a proper home so the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), in charge of all U.S. marine sanctuaries, selected the Mariners' Museum on 9 March 1987 after considering proposals from several other institutions.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 42\u201343</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Broadwater|first1=John|title=The USS Monitor: In Situ Preservation and Recovery|url=https://www.academia.edu/3257947|website=academia.edu|accessdate=8 April 2016}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Recovery===\n[[File:UpsideDownTurret1.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo showing recovery of turret as it hoisted up and breaks the surface|Replica of ''Monitor''{{'}}s turret in the Mariners' Museum as it was recovered]]\nInitial efforts in 1995 by Navy and NOAA divers to raise the warship's propeller were foiled by an abnormally stormy season off Cape Hatteras. Realizing that raising the whole wreck was impractical for financial reasons as well as the inability to bring up the wreck intact, NOAA developed a comprehensive plan to recover the most significant parts of the ship, namely her engine, propeller, guns, and turret. It estimated that the plan would cost over 20 million dollars to implement over four years. The Department of Defense Legacy Resource Management Program contributed $14.5&nbsp;million. The Navy divers, mainly from its two [[Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit]]s, would perform the bulk of the work necessary in order to train in deep sea conditions and evaluate new equipment.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 44\u201348</ref>\n\nAnother effort to raise ''Monitor''{{'}}s propeller was successful on 8 June 1998, although the amount of effort required to work in the difficult conditions off Cape Hatteras was underestimated and the fewer than 30 divers used were nearly overwhelmed. The 1999 dive season was mostly research oriented as divers investigated the wreck in detail, planning how to recover the engine and determining if they could stabilize the hull so that it would not collapse onto the turret. In 2000 the divers [[Shoring|shored]] up the port side of the hull with bags of [[grout]], installed the engine recovery system, an external framework to which the engine would be attached, in preparation for the next season, and made over five times as many dives as they had the previous season.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 48\u201350</ref>\n\nThe 2001 dive season concentrated on raising the ship's steam engine and [[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]. Hull plates had to be removed to access the engine compartment and both the engine and the condenser had to be separated from the ship, the surrounding wreckage and each other. A [[Mini Rover ROV]] was used to provide visibility of the wreck and divers to the support staff above water. The engine was raised on 16 July and the condenser three days later by the [[crane barge]] ''Wotan''. [[Saturation diving]] was evaluated by the Navy that dive season on ''Monitor'' and proved to be very successful, allowing divers to maximize their time on the bottom.<ref>[[#Broadwater|Broadwater, 2012]], pp. 156\u201362</ref> The [[Surface supplied diving|surface-supplied divers]] evaluated the use of [[heliox]] due to the depth of the wreck.

Around 160 divers were assigned to remove the parts of the hull, including the armor belt, that lay on top of the turret using chisels, [[exothermic]] [[cutting torch]]es and {{convert|20000|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on}} [[Hydrodemolition|hydroblasters]]. They removed as much of the debris from inside the turret as possible to reduce the weight to be lifted. This was usually [[Concretion|concreted]] coal as one of the ship's coal bunkers had ruptured and dumped most of its contents into the turret. The divers prepared the turret roof for the first stage of the lift by excavating underneath the turret and placed steel beams and angle irons to reinforce it for its move onto a lifting platform for the second stage. A large, eight-legged lifting frame, nicknamed the \"spider\", was carefully positioned over the turret to move it onto the platform and the entire affair would be lifted by the crane mounted on the ''Wotan''. The divers discovered one skeleton in the turret on 26 July before the lift and spent a week carefully chipping about half of it free of the concreted debris; the other half was inaccessible underneath the rear of one of the guns.<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 63, 102, 120, 186, 210</ref>\n\nWith [[Tropical Storm Cristobal (2002)|Tropical Storm Cristobal]] bearing down on the recovery team, and time and money running out,<ref>[[#Clancy|Clancy, 2013]], pp. 212\u201313, 230</ref> the team made the decision to raise the turret on 5 August 2002, after 41 days of work, and the gun turret broke the surface at 5:30&nbsp;pm to the cheers of everyone aboard ''Wotan'' and other recovery ships nearby.<ref>[[#Broadwater|Broadwater, 2012]], p. 183</ref> As archaeologists examined the contents of the turret after it has been landed aboard ''Wotan'', they discovered a second skeleton, but removing it did not begin until the turret arrived at the Mariners' Museum for conservation.

Many more were built, including [[river monitor]]s, and they played key roles in Civil War battles on the Mississippi and James Rivers. The [[breastwork monitor]] was developed during the 1860s by Sir [[Edward James Reed|Edward Reed]], [[Director of Naval Construction|Chief Constructor]] of the [[Royal Navy]], as an improvement of the basic Monitor design. Reed gave these ships a superstructure to increase seaworthiness and raise the freeboard of the gun turrets so they could be worked in all weathers. The superstructure was armored to protect the bases of the turrets, the funnels and the ventilator ducts in what he termed a [[breastwork (fortification)|breastwork]]. The ships were conceived as harbor defense ships with little need to leave port. Reed took advantage of the lack of masts and designed the ships with one twin-gun turret at each end of the superstructure, each able to turn and fire in a 270\u00b0 arc.<ref>[[#Parkes|Parkes, 1990]], p. 166</ref> These ships were described by Admiral [[George Alexander Ballard]] as being like \"full-armoured knights riding on donkeys, easy to avoid but bad to close with\".<ref>[[#Ballard|Ballard, 1980]], p. 219</ref> Reed later developed the design into the {{sclass-|Devastation|ironclad|4}}, the first ocean-going [[turret ship]]s without masts, the direct ancestors of the [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s and the [[dreadnought]]s.<ref>[[#Chesneau|Chesneau & Kolesnik, 1979]], p. 23</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|American Civil War|right=yes}}\n*[[Bibliography of early American naval history#American Civil War|Bibliography of American Civil War naval history]]\n*[[List of monitors of the United States Navy]]\n*[[List of National Historic Landmarks in North Carolina]]\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Dare County, North Carolina]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notes|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book |title=Harriet Tubman, Secret Agent: How Daring Slaves and Free Blacks Spied for the Union During the Civil War |last=Allen |first=Thomas B. |ref=Allen |publisher=National Geographic Books |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4263-0401-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/harriettubmansec00alle }} 191 pages.\n*{{cite book |title=By Sea and by River: The Naval History of the Civil War |last=Anderson |first=Bern |ref=Anderson |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-306-80367-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/byseabyrivernava0000ande }} 303 pages.\n* {{cite book|last=Ballard |first=G.

Absent implausibly large differences in marginal spending propensities among the groups, it was suggested, pure redistributions should have no significant macroeconomic effects.\n\nBuilding on both the monetary hypothesis of [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]] as well as the debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher, Bernanke developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output. He builds on Fisher's argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens, which in turn leads to debtor insolvency, thus leading to lowered [[aggregate demand]] and further decline in the price level, which develops into a debt deflation spiral. According to Bernanke a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy. But when the deflation is severe, falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets. Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions. That in turn leads to a [[credit crunch]] that does serious harm to the economy. A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption, which leads to declining aggregate demand, which additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral.<ref>Randall E. Parker, ''Reflections on the Great Depression'', Edward Elgar Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|9781843765509}}, p. 14-15</ref>\n\n== Post-Keynesian interpretation ==\nDebt deflation has been studied and developed largely in the [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesian school]].\n\nThe [[financial instability hypothesis]] of [[Hyman Minsky]], developed in the 1980s, complements Fisher's theory in providing an explanation of how credit bubbles form: the financial instability hypothesis explains how bubbles form, while debt deflation explains how they burst and the resulting economic effects. Mathematical models of debt deflation have recently been developed by post-Keynesian economist [[Steve Keen]].\n\n== Solutions ==\nFisher viewed the solution to debt deflation as [[reflation]] \u2013 returning the price level to the level it was prior to deflation \u2013 followed by price stability, which would break the \"vicious spiral\" of debt deflation. In the absence of reflation, he predicted an end only after \"needless and cruel bankruptcy, unemployment, and starvation\",<ref>Compare: \"Let us beware of this dangerous theory of [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] which is supposed to be automatically established. A certain kind of equilibrium, it is true, is reestablished in the long run, but it is after a frightful amount of suffering.\", [[Simonde de Sismondi]], ''New Principles of Political Economy,'' vol. 1 (1819), pp. 20\u201321.</ref> followed by \"a new boom-depression sequence\":<ref>[http://seekingalpha.com/article/104135-irving-fisher-on-debt-deflation-and-depression Irving Fisher on Debt, Deflation, and Depression], Brian Griffin, November 05, 2008, Seeking Alpha</ref>\n{{quote|Unless some counteracting cause comes along to prevent the fall in the price level, such a depression as that of 1929-33 (namely when the more the debtors pay the more they owe) tends to continue, going deeper, in a vicious spiral, for many years. There is then no tendency of the boat to stop tipping until it has capsized. Ultimately, of course, but only after almost universal bankruptcy, the indebtedness must cease to grow greater and begin to grow less. Then comes recovery and a tendency for a new boom-depression sequence. This is the so-called \"natural\" way out of a depression, via needless and cruel bankruptcy, unemployment, and starvation.\n\nOn the other hand, if the foregoing analysis is correct, it is always economically possible to stop or prevent such a depression simply by reflating the price level up to the average level at which outstanding debts were contracted by existing debtors and assumed by existing creditors, and then maintaining that level unchanged.}}\n\nLater commentators do not in general believe that reflation is sufficient, and primarily propose two solutions: [[debt relief]] \u2013 particularly via [[inflation]] \u2013 and [[fiscal stimulus]].\n\nFollowing Hyman Minsky, some argue that the debts assumed at the height of the bubble simply cannot be repaid \u2013 that they are based on the assumption of ''rising'' asset prices, rather than stable asset prices: the so-called \"Ponzi units\". Such debts cannot be repaid in a stable price environment, much less a deflationary environment, and instead must either be defaulted on, forgiven, or restructured.\n\nWidespread debt relief either requires government action or individual negotiations between every debtor and creditor, and is thus politically contentious or requires much labor. A categorical method of debt relief is inflation, which reduces the ''real'' debt burden, as debts are generally ''nominally'' denominated: if wages and prices double, but debts remain the same, the debt level drops in half. The effect of inflation is more pronounced the higher the [[debt to GDP ratio]] is: at a 50% ratio, one year of 10% inflation reduces the ratio by approximately <math>50\\% \\times 10\\% = 5\\%,</math> to 45%, while at a 300% ratio, one year of 10% inflation reduces the ratio by approximately <math>300\\% \\times 10\\% = 30\\%,</math> to 270%. In terms of [[Exchange rate|foreign exchange]], particularly of sovereign debt, inflation corresponds to [[currency devaluation]]. Inflation results in a wealth transfer from creditors to debtors, since creditors are not repaid as much in real terms as was expected, and on this basis this solution is criticized and politically contentious.\n\nIn the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] tradition, some suggest that the fall in [[aggregate demand]] caused by falling ''private'' debt can be compensated for, at least temporarily, by growth in ''public'' debt \u2013 \"swap private debt for government debt\", or more evocatively, a government credit bubble replacing the private credit bubble. Indeed, some argue that this is the mechanism by which Keynesian economics actually works in a depression \u2013 \"[[fiscal stimulus]]\" simply meaning growth in government debt, hence boosting aggregate demand. Given the level of government debt growth required, some proponents of debt deflation such as [[Steve Keen]] are pessimistic about these Keynesian suggestions.<ref>[http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2008/11/29/can-the-usa-debt-spend-its-way-out/ Can the USA debt-spend its way out?], November 29th, 2008, [[Steve Keen]]</ref>\n\nGiven the perceived political difficulties in debt relief and the suggested inefficacy of alternative courses of action, proponents of debt deflation are either pessimistic about solutions, expecting extended, possibly decades-long depressions, or believe that private debt relief (and related public debt relief \u2013 de facto sovereign debt repudiation) will result from an extended period of inflation.\n\n== Empirical support and modern mainstream interest ==\n[[File:U.S. Public and Private Debt as a % of GDP.jpg|thumb]]\nSeveral studies prove that the empirical support for the validity of the debt deflation hypothesis as laid down by Fisher and Bernanke is substantial, especially against the background of the Great Depression. Empirical support for the Bernanke transmission mechanism in the post\u2013World War II economic activity is weaker.<ref>Randall E. Parker, ''Reflections on the Great Depression'', Edward Elgar Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|9781843765509}}, p. 15</ref>\n\nThere was a renewal of interest in debt deflation in academia in the 1980s and 1990s,<ref>{{Harv|Bernanke|1995|loc=p. 17}}</ref> and a further renewal of interest in debt deflation due to the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]] and the ensuing [[Great Recession]].<ref name=\"shadow\" />\n\nIn 2008, Deepak Lal wrote, \"Bernanke has made sure that the second leg of a Fisherian debt deflation will not occur.

Absent implausibly large differences in marginal spending propensities among the groups, it was suggested, pure redistributions should have no significant macroeconomic effects.\n\nBuilding on both the monetary hypothesis of [[Milton Friedman]] and [[Anna Schwartz]] as well as the debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher, Bernanke developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output. He builds on Fisher's argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens, which in turn leads to debtor insolvency, thus leading to lowered [[aggregate demand]] and further decline in the price level, which develops into a debt deflation spiral. According to Bernanke a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy. But when the deflation is severe, falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets. Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions. That in turn leads to a [[credit crunch]] that does serious harm to the economy. A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption, which leads to declining aggregate demand, which additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral.<ref>Randall E. Parker, ''Reflections on the Great Depression'', Edward Elgar Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|9781843765509}}, p. 14-15</ref>\n\n== Post-Keynesian interpretation ==\nDebt deflation has been studied and developed largely in the [[Post-Keynesian economics|post-Keynesian school]].\n\nThe [[financial instability hypothesis]] of [[Hyman Minsky]], developed in the 1980s, complements Fisher's theory in providing an explanation of how credit bubbles form: the financial instability hypothesis explains how bubbles form, while debt deflation explains how they burst and the resulting economic effects. Mathematical models of debt deflation have recently been developed by post-Keynesian economist [[Steve Keen]].\n\n== Solutions ==\nFisher viewed the solution to debt deflation as [[reflation]] \u2013 returning the price level to the level it was prior to deflation \u2013 followed by price stability, which would break the \"vicious spiral\" of debt deflation. In the absence of reflation, he predicted an end only after \"needless and cruel bankruptcy, unemployment, and starvation\",<ref>Compare: \"Let us beware of this dangerous theory of [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] which is supposed to be automatically established. A certain kind of equilibrium, it is true, is reestablished in the long run, but it is after a frightful amount of suffering.\", [[Simonde de Sismondi]], ''New Principles of Political Economy,'' vol. 1 (1819), pp. 20\u201321.</ref> followed by \"a new boom-depression sequence\":<ref>[http://seekingalpha.com/article/104135-irving-fisher-on-debt-deflation-and-depression Irving Fisher on Debt, Deflation, and Depression], Brian Griffin, November 05, 2008, Seeking Alpha</ref>\n{{quote|Unless some counteracting cause comes along to prevent the fall in the price level, such a depression as that of 1929-33 (namely when the more the debtors pay the more they owe) tends to continue, going deeper, in a vicious spiral, for many years. There is then no tendency of the boat to stop tipping until it has capsized. Ultimately, of course, but only after almost universal bankruptcy, the indebtedness must cease to grow greater and begin to grow less. Then comes recovery and a tendency for a new boom-depression sequence. This is the so-called \"natural\" way out of a depression, via needless and cruel bankruptcy, unemployment, and starvation.\n\nOn the other hand, if the foregoing analysis is correct, it is always economically possible to stop or prevent such a depression simply by reflating the price level up to the average level at which outstanding debts were contracted by existing debtors and assumed by existing creditors, and then maintaining that level unchanged.}}\n\nLater commentators do not in general believe that reflation is sufficient, and primarily propose two solutions: [[debt relief]] \u2013 particularly via [[inflation]] \u2013 and [[fiscal stimulus]].\n\nFollowing Hyman Minsky, some argue that the debts assumed at the height of the bubble simply cannot be repaid \u2013 that they are based on the assumption of ''rising'' asset prices, rather than stable asset prices: the so-called \"Ponzi units\". Such debts cannot be repaid in a stable price environment, much less a deflationary environment, and instead must either be defaulted on, forgiven, or restructured.\n\nWidespread debt relief either requires government action or individual negotiations between every debtor and creditor, and is thus politically contentious or requires much labor. A categorical method of debt relief is inflation, which reduces the ''real'' debt burden, as debts are generally ''nominally'' denominated: if wages and prices double, but debts remain the same, the debt level drops in half. The effect of inflation is more pronounced the higher the [[debt to GDP ratio]] is: at a 50% ratio, one year of 10% inflation reduces the ratio by approximately <math>50\\% \\times 10\\% = 5\\%,</math> to 45%, while at a 300% ratio, one year of 10% inflation reduces the ratio by approximately <math>300\\% \\times 10\\% = 30\\%,</math> to 270%. In terms of [[Exchange rate|foreign exchange]], particularly of sovereign debt, inflation corresponds to [[currency devaluation]]. Inflation results in a wealth transfer from creditors to debtors, since creditors are not repaid as much in real terms as was expected, and on this basis this solution is criticized and politically contentious.\n\nIn the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] tradition, some suggest that the fall in [[aggregate demand]] caused by falling ''private'' debt can be compensated for, at least temporarily, by growth in ''public'' debt \u2013 \"swap private debt for government debt\", or more evocatively, a government credit bubble replacing the private credit bubble. Indeed, some argue that this is the mechanism by which Keynesian economics actually works in a depression \u2013 \"[[fiscal stimulus]]\" simply meaning growth in government debt, hence boosting aggregate demand. Given the level of government debt growth required, some proponents of debt deflation such as [[Steve Keen]] are pessimistic about these Keynesian suggestions.<ref>[http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2008/11/29/can-the-usa-debt-spend-its-way-out/ Can the USA debt-spend its way out?], November 29th, 2008, [[Steve Keen]]</ref>\n\nGiven the perceived political difficulties in debt relief and the suggested inefficacy of alternative courses of action, proponents of debt deflation are either pessimistic about solutions, expecting extended, possibly decades-long depressions, or believe that private debt relief (and related public debt relief \u2013 de facto sovereign debt repudiation) will result from an extended period of inflation.\n\n== Empirical support and modern mainstream interest ==\n[[File:U.S. Public and Private Debt as a % of GDP.jpg|thumb]]\nSeveral studies prove that the empirical support for the validity of the debt deflation hypothesis as laid down by Fisher and Bernanke is substantial, especially against the background of the Great Depression. Empirical support for the Bernanke transmission mechanism in the post\u2013World War II economic activity is weaker.<ref>Randall E. Parker, ''Reflections on the Great Depression'', Edward Elgar Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|9781843765509}}, p. 15</ref>\n\nThere was a renewal of interest in debt deflation in academia in the 1980s and 1990s,<ref>{{Harv|Bernanke|1995|loc=p. 17}}</ref> and a further renewal of interest in debt deflation due to the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]] and the ensuing [[Great Recession]].<ref name=\"shadow\" />\n\nIn 2008, Deepak Lal wrote, \"Bernanke has made sure that the second leg of a Fisherian debt deflation will not occur.

The Portuguese arrived in the final days of a long pre-colonial struggle between Tupis and Tapuias, which had resulted in the defeat and expulsion of the Tapuias from most coastal areas.\n\nAlthough the coastal Tupi were broken down into sub-tribes, frequently hostile to each other, they were culturally and linguistically homogeneous. The fact that the early Europeans encountered practically the same people and language all along the Brazilian coast greatly simplified early communication and interaction.\n\nCoastal Sequence c. 1500 (north to south):<ref>Boundary details are partly derived from [http://www.arara.fr/BBTRIBOS.html Tribos Ind\u00edgenas Brasileiras]</ref>\n# '''[[Tupinamb\u00e1 people|Tupinamb\u00e1]]''' (Tupi, from the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] delta to [[Maranh\u00e3o]])\n# '''[[Trememb\u00e9 people|Trememb\u00e9]]''' (Tapuia, coastal tribe, ranged from [[S\u00e3o Luis Island]] (south Maranh\u00e3o) to the mouth of the [[Acara\u00fa River]] in north [[Cear\u00e1]]; French traders cultivated an alliance with them)\n# '''[[Potiguara people|Potiguara]]''' (Tupi, literally \"shrimp-eaters\"; they had a reputation as great canoeists and aggressively expansionist, inhabited a great coastal stretch from [[Acara\u00fa River]] to [[Itamarac\u00e1]] island, covering the modern states of southern Cear\u00e1, Rio Grande do Norte and Para\u00edba.)\n# '''[[Tabajara]]''' (tiny Tupi tribe between Itamarac\u00e1 island and [[Para\u00edba do Norte River|Para\u00edba River]]; neighbors and frequent victims of the Potiguara)\n# '''[[Caet\u00e9 people|Caet\u00e9]]''' (Tupi group in [[Pernambuco]] and [[Alagoas]], ranged from [[Para\u00edba do Meio River|Para\u00edba River]] to the [[S\u00e3o Francisco River]]; after killing and eating a Portuguese bishop, they were subjected to Portuguese extermination raids and the remnant pushed into the Par\u00e1 interior)\n# '''[[Tupinamb\u00e1 people|Tupinamb\u00e1]]''' again (Tupi par excellence, ranged from the S\u00e3o Francisco River to the [[Bay of All Saints]], population estimated as high as 100,000; hosted Portuguese castaway [[Caramuru]])\n# '''[[Tupiniquim]]''' (Tupi, covered [[Bahia]]n [[Bahia#The Discovery Coast|discovery coast]], from around [[Camamu]] to [[S\u00e3o Mateus River]]; these were the first indigenous people encountered by the Portuguese, having met the landing of captain [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in April 1500)\n# '''[[Botocudo people|Aimor\u00e9]]''' (Tapuia (J\u00ea) tribe; concentrated on a sliver of coast in modern [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]] state)\n# '''[[Goitac\u00e1 people|Goitac\u00e1]]''' (Tapuia tribe; once dominated the coast from [[S\u00e3o Mateus River]] (in Esp\u00edrito Santo state) down to the [[Para\u00edba do Sul]] river (in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] state); hunter-gatherers and fishermen, they were a shy people that avoided all contact with foreigners; estimated at 12,000; they had a fearsome reputation and were eventually annihilated by European colonists)\n# '''[[Temimin\u00f3]]''' (small Tupi tribe, centered on [[Governador Island]] in [[Guanabara Bay]]; frequently at war with the Tamoio around them)\n# '''[[Tamoio]]''' (Tupi, old branch of the Tupinamb\u00e1, ranged from the western edge of Guanabara bay to [[Ilha Grande]])\n# '''[[Tupinamb\u00e1 people|Tupinamb\u00e1]]''' again (Tupi, indistinct from the Tamoio.

The subtropical Guarani cultivated [[maize]], tropical Tupi cultivated manioc ([[cassava]]), highland J\u00eas cultivated [[peanut]], as the staple of their diet. Supplementary crops included [[bean]]s, [[sweet potato]]es, car\u00e1 ([[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]), ''jerimum'' ([[pumpkin]]), and ''cumari'' ([[capsicum]] pepper).\n\nBehind these coasts, the interior of Brazil was dominated primarily by Tapuia (J\u00ea) people, although significant sections of the interior (notably the upper reaches of the [[Xingu River|Xingu]], [[Teles Pires]] and [[Juruena River]]s - the area now covered roughly by modern [[Mato Grosso]] state) were the original pre-migration Tupi-Guarani homelands.  Besides the Tupi and Tapuia, it is common to identify two other indigenous mega-groups in the interior: the [[Kalina people|Caribs]], who inhabited much of what is now northwestern Brazil, including both shores of the [[Amazon River]] up to the delta and the [[Nuaraque]] group, whose constituent tribes inhabited several areas, including most of the upper Amazon (west of what is now [[Manaus]]) and also significant pockets in modern [[Amap\u00e1]] and [[Roraima]] states.\n\nThe names by which the different Tupi tribes were recorded by Portuguese and French authors of the 16th century are poorly understood. Most do not seem to be proper names, but descriptions of relationship, usually familial - e.g. ''tupi'' means \"first father\", ''tupinamb\u00e1'' means \"relatives of the ancestors\", ''tupiniquim'' means \"side-neighbors\", ''tamoio'' means \"grandfather\", ''temimin\u00f3'' means \"grandson\", ''tabajara'' means \"in-laws\" and so on.<ref>M. Pereira Gomes, ''The Indians and Brazil'', p.32</ref>  Some etymologists believe these names reflect the ordering of the migration waves of Tupi people from the interior to the coasts, e.g. first Tupi wave to reach the coast being the \"grandfathers\" (Tamoio), soon joined by the \"relatives of the ancients\" (Tupinamba), by which it could mean relatives of the Tamoio, or a Tamoio term to refer to relatives of the old Tupi back in the upper Amazon basin. The \"grandsons\" (Temimin\u00f3) might be a splinter. The \"side-neighbors\" (Tupiniquim) meant perhaps recent arrivals, still trying to jostle their way in. However, by 1870 the Tupi tribes population had declined to 250,000 indigenous people and by 1890 had diminished to an approximate 100,000.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \n! colspan=2 | Native Brazilian Population in Northeast Coast (Dutch estimates)<ref>Leslie Bethell, MARY AMAZONAS LEITE DE BARROS\n. \"Hist\u00f3ria da Am\u00e9rica Latina: Am\u00e9rica Latina Colonial Vol. 2\".

[[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], the official scribe of [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]], the commander of the discovery fleet which landed in the present state of [[Bahia]], wrote a letter to the King of Portugal describing in glowing terms the beauty of the land.\n\nIn  \u201cHistoire des d\u00e9couvertes et conquestes des Portugais dans le Nouveau Monde,\u201d  <ref>[http://eada.lib.umd.edu/text-entries/histoire-des-decouvertes-et-conquestes-des-portugais-dans-le-nouveau-monde/], Joseph \u2013 Francois Lafitau, 1700.</ref> Lafiatau described the natives as people who wore no clothing but rather painted their whole bodies with red. Their ears noses, lips and cheeks were pierced. The men would shave the front, the top of the head and over the ears, while the women would typically wear their hair loose or in braids. Both men and women would accessorize themselves with noisy porcelain collars and bracelets, feathers dried fruits. He describes the ritualistic nature of how they practiced cannibalism, and he even mentions the importance of the role of the women in a household.\n\nAt the time of European arrival, the territory of current day Brazil had as many as 2,000 nations and tribes. The indigenous people were traditionally mostly semi-nomadic tribes who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. For hundreds of years, the indigenous people of Brazil lived a semi-nomadic life, managing the forests to meet their needs. When the Portuguese arrived in 1500, the natives were living mainly on the coast and along the banks of major rivers. Initially, the Europeans saw native people as [[noble savage]]s, and [[miscegenation]] of the population began right away. Portuguese claims of tribal warfare, [[cannibalism]], and the pursuit of Amazonian [[brazilwood]] for its treasured red dye convinced the Portuguese that they should \"civilize\" the natives (originally, colonists called Brazil [[Terra de Santa Cruz]], until later it acquired its name (see [[List of meanings of countries' names]]) from [[brazilwood]]). But the Portuguese, like the Spanish in their North American territories, had brought diseases with them against which many Indians were helpless due to lack of immunity. [[Measles]], [[smallpox]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[influenza]] killed tens of thousands. The diseases spread quickly along the indigenous trade routes, and it is likely that whole tribes were annihilated without ever coming in direct contact with Europeans.\n\n===Slavery and the bandeiras===\n[[File:Famille d\u2019un Chef Camacan se pr\u00e9parant pour une F\u00eate.jpg|thumb|right|Brazilian Indians during a ritual, [[Debret]]]]\nThe mutual feeling of wonderment and good relationship was to end in the succeeding years.\nThe Portuguese [[colonist]]s, all males, started to have children with female Amerindians, creating a new generation of mixed-race people who spoke Indian languages (a [[Tupi language]] called [[Nheengatu language|Nheengatu]]). The children of these Portuguese men and Indian women formed the majority of the population. Groups of fierce pathfinders organized expeditions called \"[[Bandeirantes|bandeiras]]\" (flags) into the backlands to claim them for the Portuguese crown and to look for [[gold]] and [[precious stone]]s.\n\nIntending to profit from the [[sugar trade]], the Portuguese decided to plant [[sugar cane]] in Brazil, and to use indigenous slaves as the workforce, as the Spanish colonies were successfully doing. But the indigenous people were hard to capture. They were soon  infected by diseases brought by the Europeans against which they had no natural [[immune system|immunity]], and began dying in great numbers.\n\n===The Jesuits: Protectors of the Indians===\n{{Main|Jesuit Reductions}}\n[[File:Indigenous brazil.jpg|thumb|right|Map of [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous territories]] in Brazil.]]\nThe [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priests, who had come with the first [[Governor General]] to provide religious assistance to the colonists, but mainly to convert the [[Paganism|Pagan]] people to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], took the side of the Indians and extracted a Papal [[papal bull|bull]] stating that they were human and should be protected.\n\nJesuit priests such as fathers [[Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta]] and [[Manuel da N\u00f3brega]] studied and recorded their language and founded mixed settlements, such as [[S\u00e3o Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga]], where colonists and Indians lived side by side, speaking the same ''[[L\u00edngua Geral]]'' (common language) and freely intermarried. They began also to establish more remote villages peopled only by \"civilized\" Indians, called ''Missions'', or [[Indian Reductions|reductions]] (see the article on the [[Guarani people]] for more details).\n\nBy the middle of the 16th century, Catholic [[Jesuit]] priests, at the behest of Portugal's monarchy, had established missions throughout the country's colonies. They became protectors of the Indians and worked to both Europeanize them and convert them to [[Catholicism]]. The Jesuits provided a period of relative stability for the Indians.\n\nIn the mid-1770s, the Indians' fragile co-existence with the colonists was again threatened. Because of a complex diplomatic web between [[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], the Jesuits were expelled from Brazil and the missions confiscated and sold.\n\nBy 1800, the population of Brazil had reached approximately 3.25 million, of which only 250,000 were [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]]. And for the next four decades, the Indians were largely left alone.\n\n===Wars===\n[[File:Debret2.jpg|thumb|upright|A Tamoio Warrior depicted by [[Jean-Baptiste Debret]] in the early 19th century.]]\nA number of wars between several tribes, such as the [[Tamoio Confederation]], and the Portuguese ensued, sometimes with the Indians siding with enemies of Portugal, such as the French, in the famous episode of [[France Antarctique]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], sometimes allying themselves to Portugal in their fight against other tribes. At approximately the same period, a German soldier, [[Hans Staden]], was captured by the [[Tupinamb\u00e1 people|Tupinamb\u00e1]] and released after a while. He described it in a famous book, ''Warhaftige Historia und beschreibung eyner Landtschafft der Wilden Nacketen, Grimmigen Menschfresser-Leuthen in der Newenwelt America gelegen'' (True Story and Description of a Country of Wild, Naked, Grim, Man-eating People in the New World, America) (1557)\n\nThere are various documented accounts of [[smallpox]] being knowingly used as a biological weapon by New Brazilian villagers that wanted to get rid of nearby Indian tribes (not always aggressive ones). The most \"classical\", according to Anthropologist, M\u00e9rcio Pereira Gomes, happened in Caxias, in south Maranh\u00e3o, where local farmers, wanting more land to extend their cattle farms, gave clothing owned by ill villagers (that normally would be burned to prevent further infection) to the Timbira. The clothing infected the entire tribe, and they had neither immunity nor cure. Similar things happened in other villages throughout South America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socioambiental.org/noticias/nsa/nsa/detalhe?id=64|title=Not\u00edcias socioambientais :: Socioambiental|work=socioambiental.org|accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===The rubber trade===\nThe 1840s brought trade and wealth to the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]. The process for [[vulcanization|vulcanizing]] [[rubber]] was developed, and worldwide demand for the product skyrocketed. The best [[rubber tree]]s in the world grew in the Amazon, and thousands of rubber tappers began to work the plantations. When the Indians proved to be a difficult labor force, peasants from surrounding areas were brought into the region. In a dynamic that continues to this day, the indigenous population was at constant odds with the peasants, who the Indians felt had invaded their lands in search of treasure.\n\n===The legacy of C\u00e2ndido Rondon===\n[[File:C\u00e2ndido Rondon.jpg|thumb|upright|Marshal [[C\u00e2ndido Rondon]].]]\nIn the 20th century, the Brazilian Government adopted a more humanitarian attitude and offered official protection to the indigenous people, including the establishment of the first indigenous reserves. Fortune brightened for the Indians around the turn of the 20th century when [[C\u00e2ndido Rondon]], a man of both [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Bororo (Brazil)|Bororo]] ancestry, and an explorer and progressive officer in the Brazilian army, began working to gain the Indians' trust and establish peace. Rondon, who had been assigned to help bring telegraph communications into the Amazon, was a curious and natural explorer. In 1910, he helped found the ''[[Indian Protection Service|Servi\u00e7o de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o aos \u00cdndios]] - SPI'' (Service for the Protection of Indians, today the FUNAI, or ''[[Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do \u00cdndio]]'', National Foundation for Indians). SPI was the first federal agency charged with protecting Indians and preserving their culture. In 1914, Rondon accompanied [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on Roosevelt's famous expedition to map the Amazon and discover new species. During these travels, Rondon was appalled to see how settlers and developers treated the indigenes, and he became their lifelong friend and protector.\n\nRondon, who died in 1958, is a national hero in Brazil. The Brazilian state of [[Rond\u00f4nia]] is named after him.\n\n===SPI failure and FUNAI===\n[[File:Ind\u00edgena da etnia Tapirap\u00e9.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tapirap\u00e9 people|Tapirap\u00e9]] woman [[body painting|painting the body]].]]\nAfter Rondon's pioneering work, the SPI was turned over to bureaucrats and military officers and its work declined after 1957. The new officials did not share Rondon's deep commitment to the Indians. SPI sought to address tribal issues by transforming the tribes into mainstream Brazilian society. The lure of reservation riches enticed cattle ranchers and settlers to continue their assault on Indians lands \u2013 and the SPI eased the way. Between 1900 and 1967, an estimated 98 [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] tribes were wiped out.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nMostly due to the efforts of the [[Villas-B\u00f4as brothers]], Brazil's first Indian reserve, the [[Xingu Indigenous Park|Xingu National Park]], was established by the Federal Government in 1961.\n\nDuring the social and political upheaval in the 1960s, reports of mistreatment of Indians increasingly reached [[Brazil]]'s [[urban center]]s and began to affect Brazilian thinking. In 1967, following the publication of the ''[[Figueiredo Report]]'', commissioned by the Ministry of the Interior, the military government launched an investigation into SPI. It soon came to light that the SPI was corrupt and failing to protect natives, their lands, and, culture. The 5,000-page report catalogued atrocities including slavery, sexual abuse, torture, and mass murder.<ref name=\"urlFUNAI - National Indian Foundation (Brazil)\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/funai\n|title=FUNAI - National Indian Foundation (Brazil)\n|format=|website=\n|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref>\nIt has been charged that agency officials, in collaboration with land speculators, were systematically slaughtering the Indians by intentionally circulating disease-laced clothes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  Criminal prosecutions followed, and the SPI was disbanded. The same year the government established '''Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do \u00cdndio''' (''National Indian Foundation''), known as FUNAI which is responsible for protecting the interests, cultures, and rights of the Brazilian indigenous populations. Some tribes have become significantly integrated into Brazilian society. The unacculturated tribes which have been contacted by FUNAI, are supposed to be protected and accommodated within Brazilian society in varying degrees. By 1987 it was recognized that unessential contact with the tribes was causing illness and social disintegration. The uncontacted tribes are now supposed to be protected from intrusion and interference in their life style and territory.<ref name=\"urlFUNAI - National Indian Foundation (Brazil)\" /> However, the exploitation of [[rubber]] and other Amazonic natural resources has led to a new cycle of invasion, expulsion, massacres and death, which continues to this day.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n===The military government===\nAlso in 1964, in a seismic political shift, the Brazilian military [[1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat|took control of the government]] and abolished all existing political parties, creating a two-party system. For the next two decades, Brazil was ruled by a series of generals. The country's mantra was \"Brazil, the Country of the Future,\" which the military government used as justification for a giant push into the Amazon to exploit its resources, thereby beginning to transform Brazil into one of the leading economies of the world. Construction began on a [[Trans-Amazonian Highway|transcontinental highway]] across the Amazon basin, aimed to encourage migration to the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] and to open up the region to more trade. With funding from World Bank, thousands of square miles of forest were cleared without regard for reservation status. After the highway projects came giant hydroelectric projects, then swaths of forest were cleared for cattle ranches. As a result, reservation lands suffered massive deforestation and flooding. The public works projects attracted very few migrants, but those few \u2013 and largely poor - settlers brought new diseases that further devastated the Indians population.\n\n===Contemporary situation===\n[[File:\u00cdndios isolados no Acre 12.jpg|thumb|250px|Members of an [[Uncontacted peoples|uncontacted tribe]] encountered in the Brazilian state of [[Acre (state)|Acre]] in 2009]]\nThe [[Constitution of Brazil|1988 Brazilian Constitution]] recognizes indigenous people' right to pursue their traditional ways of life and to the permanent and exclusive possession of their \"traditional lands\", which are demarcated as [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|Indigenous Territories]].<ref name=\"constitution\">Federal Constitution of Brazil.

The Portuguese arrived in the final days of a long pre-colonial struggle between Tupis and Tapuias, which had resulted in the defeat and expulsion of the Tapuias from most coastal areas.\n\nAlthough the coastal Tupi were broken down into sub-tribes, frequently hostile to each other, they were culturally and linguistically homogeneous. The fact that the early Europeans encountered practically the same people and language all along the Brazilian coast greatly simplified early communication and interaction.\n\nCoastal Sequence c. 1500 (north to south):<ref>Boundary details are partly derived from [http://www.arara.fr/BBTRIBOS.html Tribos Ind\u00edgenas Brasileiras]</ref>\n# '''[[Tupinamb\u00e1 people|Tupinamb\u00e1]]''' (Tupi, from the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] delta to [[Maranh\u00e3o]])\n# '''[[Trememb\u00e9 people|Trememb\u00e9]]''' (Tapuia, coastal tribe, ranged from [[S\u00e3o Luis Island]] (south Maranh\u00e3o) to the mouth of the [[Acara\u00fa River]] in north [[Cear\u00e1]]; French traders cultivated an alliance with them)\n# '''[[Potiguara people|Potiguara]]''' (Tupi, literally \"shrimp-eaters\"; they had a reputation as great canoeists and aggressively expansionist, inhabited a great coastal stretch from [[Acara\u00fa River]] to [[Itamarac\u00e1]] island, covering the modern states of southern Cear\u00e1, Rio Grande do Norte and Para\u00edba.)\n# '''[[Tabajara]]''' (tiny Tupi tribe between Itamarac\u00e1 island and [[Para\u00edba do Norte River|Para\u00edba River]]; neighbors and frequent victims of the Potiguara)\n# '''[[Caet\u00e9 people|Caet\u00e9]]''' (Tupi group in [[Pernambuco]] and [[Alagoas]], ranged from [[Para\u00edba do Meio River|Para\u00edba River]] to the [[S\u00e3o Francisco River]]; after killing and eating a Portuguese bishop, they were subjected to Portuguese extermination raids and the remnant pushed into the Par\u00e1 interior)\n# '''[[Tupinamb\u00e1 people|Tupinamb\u00e1]]''' again (Tupi par excellence, ranged from the S\u00e3o Francisco River to the [[Bay of All Saints]], population estimated as high as 100,000; hosted Portuguese castaway [[Caramuru]])\n# '''[[Tupiniquim]]''' (Tupi, covered [[Bahia]]n [[Bahia#The Discovery Coast|discovery coast]], from around [[Camamu]] to [[S\u00e3o Mateus River]]; these were the first indigenous people encountered by the Portuguese, having met the landing of captain [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] in April 1500)\n# '''[[Botocudo people|Aimor\u00e9]]''' (Tapuia (J\u00ea) tribe; concentrated on a sliver of coast in modern [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]] state)\n# '''[[Goitac\u00e1 people|Goitac\u00e1]]''' (Tapuia tribe; once dominated the coast from [[S\u00e3o Mateus River]] (in Esp\u00edrito Santo state) down to the [[Para\u00edba do Sul]] river (in [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] state); hunter-gatherers and fishermen, they were a shy people that avoided all contact with foreigners; estimated at 12,000; they had a fearsome reputation and were eventually annihilated by European colonists)\n# '''[[Temimin\u00f3]]''' (small Tupi tribe, centered on [[Governador Island]] in [[Guanabara Bay]]; frequently at war with the Tamoio around them)\n# '''[[Tamoio]]''' (Tupi, old branch of the Tupinamb\u00e1, ranged from the western edge of Guanabara bay to [[Ilha Grande]])\n# '''[[Tupinamb\u00e1 people|Tupinamb\u00e1]]''' again (Tupi, indistinct from the Tamoio.

The subtropical Guarani cultivated [[maize]], tropical Tupi cultivated manioc ([[cassava]]), highland J\u00eas cultivated [[peanut]], as the staple of their diet. Supplementary crops included [[bean]]s, [[sweet potato]]es, car\u00e1 ([[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]), ''jerimum'' ([[pumpkin]]), and ''cumari'' ([[capsicum]] pepper).\n\nBehind these coasts, the interior of Brazil was dominated primarily by Tapuia (J\u00ea) people, although significant sections of the interior (notably the upper reaches of the [[Xingu River|Xingu]], [[Teles Pires]] and [[Juruena River]]s - the area now covered roughly by modern [[Mato Grosso]] state) were the original pre-migration Tupi-Guarani homelands.  Besides the Tupi and Tapuia, it is common to identify two other indigenous mega-groups in the interior: the [[Kalina people|Caribs]], who inhabited much of what is now northwestern Brazil, including both shores of the [[Amazon River]] up to the delta and the [[Nuaraque]] group, whose constituent tribes inhabited several areas, including most of the upper Amazon (west of what is now [[Manaus]]) and also significant pockets in modern [[Amap\u00e1]] and [[Roraima]] states.\n\nThe names by which the different Tupi tribes were recorded by Portuguese and French authors of the 16th century are poorly understood. Most do not seem to be proper names, but descriptions of relationship, usually familial - e.g. ''tupi'' means \"first father\", ''tupinamb\u00e1'' means \"relatives of the ancestors\", ''tupiniquim'' means \"side-neighbors\", ''tamoio'' means \"grandfather\", ''temimin\u00f3'' means \"grandson\", ''tabajara'' means \"in-laws\" and so on.<ref>M. Pereira Gomes, ''The Indians and Brazil'', p.32</ref>  Some etymologists believe these names reflect the ordering of the migration waves of Tupi people from the interior to the coasts, e.g. first Tupi wave to reach the coast being the \"grandfathers\" (Tamoio), soon joined by the \"relatives of the ancients\" (Tupinamba), by which it could mean relatives of the Tamoio, or a Tamoio term to refer to relatives of the old Tupi back in the upper Amazon basin. The \"grandsons\" (Temimin\u00f3) might be a splinter. The \"side-neighbors\" (Tupiniquim) meant perhaps recent arrivals, still trying to jostle their way in. However, by 1870 the Tupi tribes population had declined to 250,000 indigenous people and by 1890 had diminished to an approximate 100,000.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \n! colspan=2 | Native Brazilian Population in Northeast Coast (Dutch estimates)<ref>Leslie Bethell, MARY AMAZONAS LEITE DE BARROS\n. \"Hist\u00f3ria da Am\u00e9rica Latina: Am\u00e9rica Latina Colonial Vol. 2\".

Cannibalism in Brazil in 1557.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[cannibalism]] in the Brazilian Tupinamb\u00e1 tribe, as described by [[Hans Staden]].]]\n[[File:Dan\u00e7a dos Tapuias.jpg|thumb|[[Albert Eckhout]] (Dutch), [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil#Native people after the European colonization|Tapuias]] (Brazil) dancing, 17th c.]]\n\nWhen the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] explorers first arrived in Brazil in April 1500, they found, to their astonishment, a wide coastline rich in resources, teeming with hundreds of thousands of Indigenous people living in a \"paradise\" of natural riches. [[P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha]], the official scribe of [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]], the commander of the discovery fleet which landed in the present state of [[Bahia]], wrote a letter to the King of Portugal describing in glowing terms the beauty of the land.\n\nIn  \u201cHistoire des d\u00e9couvertes et conquestes des Portugais dans le Nouveau Monde,\u201d  <ref>[http://eada.lib.umd.edu/text-entries/histoire-des-decouvertes-et-conquestes-des-portugais-dans-le-nouveau-monde/], Joseph \u2013 Francois Lafitau, 1700.</ref> Lafiatau described the natives as people who wore no clothing but rather painted their whole bodies with red. Their ears noses, lips and cheeks were pierced. The men would shave the front, the top of the head and over the ears, while the women would typically wear their hair loose or in braids. Both men and women would accessorize themselves with noisy porcelain collars and bracelets, feathers dried fruits. He describes the ritualistic nature of how they practiced cannibalism, and he even mentions the importance of the role of the women in a household.\n\nAt the time of European arrival, the territory of current day Brazil had as many as 2,000 nations and tribes. The indigenous people were traditionally mostly semi-nomadic tribes who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. For hundreds of years, the indigenous people of Brazil lived a semi-nomadic life, managing the forests to meet their needs. When the Portuguese arrived in 1500, the natives were living mainly on the coast and along the banks of major rivers. Initially, the Europeans saw native people as [[noble savage]]s, and [[miscegenation]] of the population began right away. Portuguese claims of tribal warfare, [[cannibalism]], and the pursuit of Amazonian [[brazilwood]] for its treasured red dye convinced the Portuguese that they should \"civilize\" the natives (originally, colonists called Brazil [[Terra de Santa Cruz]], until later it acquired its name (see [[List of meanings of countries' names]]) from [[brazilwood]]). But the Portuguese, like the Spanish in their North American territories, had brought diseases with them against which many Indians were helpless due to lack of immunity. [[Measles]], [[smallpox]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[influenza]] killed tens of thousands. The diseases spread quickly along the indigenous trade routes, and it is likely that whole tribes were annihilated without ever coming in direct contact with Europeans.\n\n===Slavery and the bandeiras===\n[[File:Famille d\u2019un Chef Camacan se pr\u00e9parant pour une F\u00eate.jpg|thumb|right|Brazilian Indians during a ritual, [[Debret]]]]\nThe mutual feeling of wonderment and good relationship was to end in the succeeding years.\nThe Portuguese [[colonist]]s, all males, started to have children with female Amerindians, creating a new generation of mixed-race people who spoke Indian languages (a [[Tupi language]] called [[Nheengatu language|Nheengatu]]). The children of these Portuguese men and Indian women formed the majority of the population. Groups of fierce pathfinders organized expeditions called \"[[Bandeirantes|bandeiras]]\" (flags) into the backlands to claim them for the Portuguese crown and to look for [[gold]] and [[precious stone]]s.\n\nIntending to profit from the [[sugar trade]], the Portuguese decided to plant [[sugar cane]] in Brazil, and to use indigenous slaves as the workforce, as the Spanish colonies were successfully doing. But the indigenous people were hard to capture. They were soon  infected by diseases brought by the Europeans against which they had no natural [[immune system|immunity]], and began dying in great numbers.\n\n===The Jesuits: Protectors of the Indians===\n{{Main|Jesuit Reductions}}\n[[File:Indigenous brazil.jpg|thumb|right|Map of [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous territories]] in Brazil.]]\nThe [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priests, who had come with the first [[Governor General]] to provide religious assistance to the colonists, but mainly to convert the [[Paganism|Pagan]] people to [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], took the side of the Indians and extracted a Papal [[papal bull|bull]] stating that they were human and should be protected.\n\nJesuit priests such as fathers [[Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta]] and [[Manuel da N\u00f3brega]] studied and recorded their language and founded mixed settlements, such as [[S\u00e3o Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga]], where colonists and Indians lived side by side, speaking the same ''[[L\u00edngua Geral]]'' (common language) and freely intermarried. They began also to establish more remote villages peopled only by \"civilized\" Indians, called ''Missions'', or [[Indian Reductions|reductions]] (see the article on the [[Guarani people]] for more details).\n\nBy the middle of the 16th century, Catholic [[Jesuit]] priests, at the behest of Portugal's monarchy, had established missions throughout the country's colonies. They became protectors of the Indians and worked to both Europeanize them and convert them to [[Catholicism]]. The Jesuits provided a period of relative stability for the Indians.\n\nIn the mid-1770s, the Indians' fragile co-existence with the colonists was again threatened. Because of a complex diplomatic web between [[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], the Jesuits were expelled from Brazil and the missions confiscated and sold.\n\nBy 1800, the population of Brazil had reached approximately 3.25 million, of which only 250,000 were [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]]. And for the next four decades, the Indians were largely left alone.\n\n===Wars===\n[[File:Debret2.jpg|thumb|upright|A Tamoio Warrior depicted by [[Jean-Baptiste Debret]] in the early 19th century.]]\nA number of wars between several tribes, such as the [[Tamoio Confederation]], and the Portuguese ensued, sometimes with the Indians siding with enemies of Portugal, such as the French, in the famous episode of [[France Antarctique]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], sometimes allying themselves to Portugal in their fight against other tribes. At approximately the same period, a German soldier, [[Hans Staden]], was captured by the [[Tupinamb\u00e1 people|Tupinamb\u00e1]] and released after a while. He described it in a famous book, ''Warhaftige Historia und beschreibung eyner Landtschafft der Wilden Nacketen, Grimmigen Menschfresser-Leuthen in der Newenwelt America gelegen'' (True Story and Description of a Country of Wild, Naked, Grim, Man-eating People in the New World, America) (1557)\n\nThere are various documented accounts of [[smallpox]] being knowingly used as a biological weapon by New Brazilian villagers that wanted to get rid of nearby Indian tribes (not always aggressive ones). The most \"classical\", according to Anthropologist, M\u00e9rcio Pereira Gomes, happened in Caxias, in south Maranh\u00e3o, where local farmers, wanting more land to extend their cattle farms, gave clothing owned by ill villagers (that normally would be burned to prevent further infection) to the Timbira. The clothing infected the entire tribe, and they had neither immunity nor cure. Similar things happened in other villages throughout South America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socioambiental.org/noticias/nsa/nsa/detalhe?id=64|title=Not\u00edcias socioambientais :: Socioambiental|work=socioambiental.org|accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===The rubber trade===\nThe 1840s brought trade and wealth to the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]]. The process for [[vulcanization|vulcanizing]] [[rubber]] was developed, and worldwide demand for the product skyrocketed. The best [[rubber tree]]s in the world grew in the Amazon, and thousands of rubber tappers began to work the plantations. When the Indians proved to be a difficult labor force, peasants from surrounding areas were brought into the region. In a dynamic that continues to this day, the indigenous population was at constant odds with the peasants, who the Indians felt had invaded their lands in search of treasure.\n\n===The legacy of C\u00e2ndido Rondon===\n[[File:C\u00e2ndido Rondon.jpg|thumb|upright|Marshal [[C\u00e2ndido Rondon]].]]\nIn the 20th century, the Brazilian Government adopted a more humanitarian attitude and offered official protection to the indigenous people, including the establishment of the first indigenous reserves. Fortune brightened for the Indians around the turn of the 20th century when [[C\u00e2ndido Rondon]], a man of both [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Bororo (Brazil)|Bororo]] ancestry, and an explorer and progressive officer in the Brazilian army, began working to gain the Indians' trust and establish peace. Rondon, who had been assigned to help bring telegraph communications into the Amazon, was a curious and natural explorer. In 1910, he helped found the ''[[Indian Protection Service|Servi\u00e7o de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o aos \u00cdndios]] - SPI'' (Service for the Protection of Indians, today the FUNAI, or ''[[Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do \u00cdndio]]'', National Foundation for Indians). SPI was the first federal agency charged with protecting Indians and preserving their culture. In 1914, Rondon accompanied [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on Roosevelt's famous expedition to map the Amazon and discover new species. During these travels, Rondon was appalled to see how settlers and developers treated the indigenes, and he became their lifelong friend and protector.\n\nRondon, who died in 1958, is a national hero in Brazil. The Brazilian state of [[Rond\u00f4nia]] is named after him.\n\n===SPI failure and FUNAI===\n[[File:Ind\u00edgena da etnia Tapirap\u00e9.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tapirap\u00e9 people|Tapirap\u00e9]] woman [[body painting|painting the body]].]]\nAfter Rondon's pioneering work, the SPI was turned over to bureaucrats and military officers and its work declined after 1957. The new officials did not share Rondon's deep commitment to the Indians. SPI sought to address tribal issues by transforming the tribes into mainstream Brazilian society. The lure of reservation riches enticed cattle ranchers and settlers to continue their assault on Indians lands \u2013 and the SPI eased the way. Between 1900 and 1967, an estimated 98 [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] tribes were wiped out.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nMostly due to the efforts of the [[Villas-B\u00f4as brothers]], Brazil's first Indian reserve, the [[Xingu Indigenous Park|Xingu National Park]], was established by the Federal Government in 1961.\n\nDuring the social and political upheaval in the 1960s, reports of mistreatment of Indians increasingly reached [[Brazil]]'s [[urban center]]s and began to affect Brazilian thinking. In 1967, following the publication of the ''[[Figueiredo Report]]'', commissioned by the Ministry of the Interior, the military government launched an investigation into SPI. It soon came to light that the SPI was corrupt and failing to protect natives, their lands, and, culture. The 5,000-page report catalogued atrocities including slavery, sexual abuse, torture, and mass murder.<ref name=\"urlFUNAI - National Indian Foundation (Brazil)\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/funai\n|title=FUNAI - National Indian Foundation (Brazil)\n|format=|website=\n|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref>\nIt has been charged that agency officials, in collaboration with land speculators, were systematically slaughtering the Indians by intentionally circulating disease-laced clothes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  Criminal prosecutions followed, and the SPI was disbanded. The same year the government established '''Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do \u00cdndio''' (''National Indian Foundation''), known as FUNAI which is responsible for protecting the interests, cultures, and rights of the Brazilian indigenous populations. Some tribes have become significantly integrated into Brazilian society. The unacculturated tribes which have been contacted by FUNAI, are supposed to be protected and accommodated within Brazilian society in varying degrees. By 1987 it was recognized that unessential contact with the tribes was causing illness and social disintegration. The uncontacted tribes are now supposed to be protected from intrusion and interference in their life style and territory.<ref name=\"urlFUNAI - National Indian Foundation (Brazil)\" /> However, the exploitation of [[rubber]] and other Amazonic natural resources has led to a new cycle of invasion, expulsion, massacres and death, which continues to this day.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n===The military government===\nAlso in 1964, in a seismic political shift, the Brazilian military [[1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat|took control of the government]] and abolished all existing political parties, creating a two-party system. For the next two decades, Brazil was ruled by a series of generals. The country's mantra was \"Brazil, the Country of the Future,\" which the military government used as justification for a giant push into the Amazon to exploit its resources, thereby beginning to transform Brazil into one of the leading economies of the world. Construction began on a [[Trans-Amazonian Highway|transcontinental highway]] across the Amazon basin, aimed to encourage migration to the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] and to open up the region to more trade. With funding from World Bank, thousands of square miles of forest were cleared without regard for reservation status. After the highway projects came giant hydroelectric projects, then swaths of forest were cleared for cattle ranches. As a result, reservation lands suffered massive deforestation and flooding. The public works projects attracted very few migrants, but those few \u2013 and largely poor - settlers brought new diseases that further devastated the Indians population.\n\n===Contemporary situation===\n[[File:\u00cdndios isolados no Acre 12.jpg|thumb|250px|Members of an [[Uncontacted peoples|uncontacted tribe]] encountered in the Brazilian state of [[Acre (state)|Acre]] in 2009]]\nThe [[Constitution of Brazil|1988 Brazilian Constitution]] recognizes indigenous people' right to pursue their traditional ways of life and to the permanent and exclusive possession of their \"traditional lands\", which are demarcated as [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|Indigenous Territories]].<ref name=\"constitution\">Federal Constitution of Brazil.
