After meeting [[Rekeson]] in a nightclub and doing a freestyle with him, they decided to form a rap duo, and that's where [[Guerrilla Seca]] (GCK) was born. In those times; approximately in the year 1995, rap was very underground, sounding only \"La Corte.\" Rekeson and Prieto Beretta (then known as Colombia), were dedicated to improvise in the streets, where they caught the attention of Juan Carlos Echendia, who hired them for Subterr\u00e1neo Records, where they made their first record with other underground rap groups, called [[Venezuela Subterr\u00e1nea]].\n\nAfter three years, they decided to release another record, and from the hand of Subterr\u00e1neo Records the second (First solo) disc of Guerrilla Seca was born, which they called \"La Realidad M\u00e1s Real\" (The Most Real Reality), it was quite famous, making them known practically in all of Venezuela, and urging rap to be populaized.\n\nIn 2006, three years after the success of The Most Real Reality, El Prieto and Rekeson had some personal problems and decided to release two albums alone, but at the same time and under the name of GCK so as not to damage the duo. This is how \"Yo contra el mundo\" (Me Against the World) and \"Jugando Vivo\" (Playing Live) were bon. Me Against The World was criticized a lot by the fans of the duo, the opposite of Rekeson's work, which was positively received. But their differences would not last long because two years later they would already be working on their new album.\n\nAlso known for his strong differences between his exmanager Juan Carlos Echendia of the record company Subterr\u00e1neo Records and the deceased singer, [[Mc Ardilla]]. Were the most talked among other conflicts in the genre, breaking through other singers.\n\nIn 2008, they decided to release \"Al Aire Pero Preso\" (Free But Jailed), this time as a duo again, without the help of Subterr\u00e1neo Records, with whom they had some differences. The album was very accepted by the fans, but its success did not last long because one year later El Prieto and Rekeson had differences again, which caused them to separate definitively and culminate with the Guerrilla Seca project, leaving many fans disappointed. However, Rekeson continued to work on his side, as El Prieto did.\n\nMore than 8 million visits has the video \"Petare barrio de pakistan\" (Petare Neighborhood Of [[Pakistan]]), part I, on YouTube.\n\n\"People do not see the positive side of the video, but the negative side, it's not apology, the positive side: we want to give a message to Venezuela and Latin America of what is happening right now in the neighborhood, which is not just Petare Barrio of Pakistan, but it is all of Latin America of Pakistan, because all the neighborhoods of Latin America are equal\", comments El Prieto.\n\n\"In every neighborhood there are good and bad things, everyone plays basketball and football, but suddenly those people who played sports, are victims of a bad play and end up troubled. That's where the mess starts, what on the street we call Pakistan.\"\n\n\"Everyone knows that Pakistan is not in Venezuela, that remains in another continent, but people associate that there is a war and that many people die.

Although the CIA reportedly had not determined whether Khalid had any foreknowledge of Khashoggi's ultimate fate upon entering the consulate, it believed that Khalid conveyed this message to Khashoggi at his brother's behest.

Although the CIA reportedly had not determined whether Khalid had any foreknowledge of Khashoggi's ultimate fate upon entering the consulate, it believed that Khalid conveyed this message to Khashoggi at his brother's behest.

It links all major urban centres except [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], [[Taupo]], [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]], [[Whakatane]] and (since 2012) [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]]. The network is owned and managed by [[KiwiRail]]. The network was constructed from 1863 onwards, mostly by government bodies, initially [[Provinces of New Zealand|provincial governments]] and later central government (usually the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Public Works Department]]). In 1993 [[Tranz Rail|New Zealand Rail Limited]] was privatised (and later renamed Tranz Rail), with the New Zealand Railways Corporation retaining the land (due to [[Treaty of Waitangi]] claims on land taken for railway construction). In 2003 the government renationalised the network. KiwiRail operates all freight and a small number of passenger services primarily for tourists on certain routes in both islands; Transdev operates Auckland Transport 'AT Metro' suburban passenger trains in Auckland and Metlink passenger trains in the Wellington region; Dunedin Railways (formerly Taieri Gorge Railway) operates tourist passenger trains in Dunedin.\n\n==New Zealand national rail network==\n[[File:NorthIsland rrMap v02.svg|thumb|right|North Island rail network map (as of 2006)]]\n[[File:SouthIsland rrMap v02.svg|thumb|right|South Island rail network map (as of 2006)]]\nLines in '''bold type''' are currently operated by KiwiRail\n\n===Main trunk lines===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The most successful was the [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway]], which operated between Wellington and Longburn (near Palmerston North) from 1885 to 1908. After the WMR, perhaps the best-known private railway was the [[New Zealand Midland Railway Company]], which constructed parts of the Midland, Nelson and West Coast lines. After the company was dissolved in 1900 the railway lines and their construction were taken over by the government.

[[New Zealand State Highway 6|State Highway 6]] between Nelson and Blenheim was deemed by law to be an NZR railway for the purposes of calculating passenger and freight rates between railway stations in the South Island and Nelson or other places on the notional railway.  Passengers and freight travelled by road, with the difference between the road carrier's rates and railway rates subsidised by the government.  Rail rates were significantly cheaper than road rates, so the scheme provided significant benefits to its users, while imposing significant costs on the government.  The scheme lasted for 22 years, being withdrawn in October 1977.\n\n==Bush tramways==\nThese were lines principally constructed to haul timber or minerals, often in isolated areas. A variety of gauges was used, including the New Zealand standard {{RailGauge|3'6\"}}. Typical bush trams were more lightly constructed than ordinary rail lines and had steeper gradients and sharper curves. With the low speeds that were commonplace, rolling stock and locomotives were generally built to lighter standards than main-line vehicles. It was not uncommon for road vehicles to be adapted, either as haulage power or rolling stock. As road vehicles became more suited for these operations the trams gradually faded away and none are now operating.\n\nA prominent example of a [[Tramway (industrial)|bush tramway]] was the [[Taupo railway proposals#Mokai Tramway|Taupo Totara Timber Company's line between Putaruru and Mokai]], and an example of a mineral tramway was the [[Dun Mountain Railway]].\n\nOther bush and mineral tramways included -{{expand list|date=July 2016}}\n\n=== North Island ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Employing horse, steam or electric power, they operated in most cases until the 1950s when improved buses saw most of the tracks scrapped.

The network is owned and managed by [[KiwiRail]]. The network was constructed from 1863 onwards, mostly by government bodies, initially [[Provinces of New Zealand|provincial governments]] and later central government (usually the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Public Works Department]]). In 1993 [[Tranz Rail|New Zealand Rail Limited]] was privatised (and later renamed Tranz Rail), with the New Zealand Railways Corporation retaining the land (due to [[Treaty of Waitangi]] claims on land taken for railway construction). In 2003 the government renationalised the network. KiwiRail operates all freight and a small number of passenger services primarily for tourists on certain routes in both islands; Transdev operates Auckland Transport 'AT Metro' suburban passenger trains in Auckland and Metlink passenger trains in the Wellington region; Dunedin Railways (formerly Taieri Gorge Railway) operates tourist passenger trains in Dunedin.\n\n==New Zealand national rail network==\n[[File:NorthIsland rrMap v02.svg|thumb|right|North Island rail network map (as of 2006)]]\n[[File:SouthIsland rrMap v02.svg|thumb|right|South Island rail network map (as of 2006)]]\nLines in '''bold type''' are currently operated by KiwiRail\n\n===Main trunk lines===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

All except the Whakatane Board Mills line and the [[Sanson Tramway]] were later acquired by the government. The most successful was the [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway]], which operated between Wellington and Longburn (near Palmerston North) from 1885 to 1908. After the WMR, perhaps the best-known private railway was the [[New Zealand Midland Railway Company]], which constructed parts of the Midland, Nelson and West Coast lines. After the company was dissolved in 1900 the railway lines and their construction were taken over by the government.

[[New Zealand State Highway 6|State Highway 6]] between Nelson and Blenheim was deemed by law to be an NZR railway for the purposes of calculating passenger and freight rates between railway stations in the South Island and Nelson or other places on the notional railway.  Passengers and freight travelled by road, with the difference between the road carrier's rates and railway rates subsidised by the government.  Rail rates were significantly cheaper than road rates, so the scheme provided significant benefits to its users, while imposing significant costs on the government.  The scheme lasted for 22 years, being withdrawn in October 1977.\n\n==Bush tramways==\nThese were lines principally constructed to haul timber or minerals, often in isolated areas. A variety of gauges was used, including the New Zealand standard {{RailGauge|3'6\"}}. Typical bush trams were more lightly constructed than ordinary rail lines and had steeper gradients and sharper curves. With the low speeds that were commonplace, rolling stock and locomotives were generally built to lighter standards than main-line vehicles. It was not uncommon for road vehicles to be adapted, either as haulage power or rolling stock. As road vehicles became more suited for these operations the trams gradually faded away and none are now operating.\n\nA prominent example of a [[Tramway (industrial)|bush tramway]] was the [[Taupo railway proposals#Mokai Tramway|Taupo Totara Timber Company's line between Putaruru and Mokai]], and an example of a mineral tramway was the [[Dun Mountain Railway]].\n\nOther bush and mineral tramways included -{{expand list|date=July 2016}}\n\n=== North Island ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Employing horse, steam or electric power, they operated in most cases until the 1950s when improved buses saw most of the tracks scrapped. Urban tram operations, built from scratch as tourist attractions, have more recently been restarted in Christchurch (1995)  Auckland (2011), and Wanganui (2013).
