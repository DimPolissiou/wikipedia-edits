The [[United States Forest Service]] (then called the National Forest Service) was only five years old at the time and unprepared for the possibilities of the dry summer or a fire of this magnitude, though all summer it had been urgently recruiting as many men as possible to fight the hundreds of fires already burning, many with little forestry or firefighting experience.<ref name=\"AmExp\"/> Earlier in August President [[William Howard Taft]] had authorized the addition of military troops to the effort, and 4,000 troops, including seven companies from the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[25th Infantry Regiment (United States)|25th Infantry Regiment]] (known as the [[Buffalo Soldier]]s), were brought in to help fight the fires burning in the northern Rockies.<ref name=\"Inferno\"/><ref name=25th>{{citation| title=Report of the Commanding Officer of G Company, 25th Infantry Regiment| first=Edson E.| last=Lewis| date=September 7, 1910}} in {{cite journal| first=Marvin| last=Fletcher| title=Army Fire Fighters| url=https://foresthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Army-Fire-Fighters.pdf| format=PDF|date=Summer 1972| journal=Idaho Yesterdays| pages=12\u201315| accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref> The arrival of the Buffalo Soldiers troops almost doubled the black population of Idaho.<ref name=\"AmExp\"/>\n\nSmoke from the fire was said to have been seen as far east as [[Watertown, New York]], and as far south as [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].

are the contributions within [[Turkey]] to the emission of [[greenhouse gasses]] such as [[carbon dioxide]] or [[ hydrofluorocarbons]]. Turkey's human contributions to emissions can be segmented by sector, such as looking specifically at [[List of power stations in Turkey|Turkey's power stations]] or transport. In addition, the natural and [[Agriculture in Turkey|agricultural landscape of Turkey]] contribute to its national greenhouse gas emissions, with methane and [[N2O|N<sub>2</sub>O]] from agriculture more than offset by carbon dioxide trapped in forests, thus slightly reducing Turkey's overall emissions.

He served as the chairman and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee Corporation]] for more than two decades; first from 1986 to 2000, and then from 2008 to 2017. After stepping down as CEO, Schultz stayed at the company from 2017 to 2018 as its executive chairman overseeing Starbuck's philanthropic and charitable giving arm. From 2001 to 2006, he owned the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], a basketball franchise that he sold for [[United States dollar|US$]]350 million to [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who moved the team to Oklahoma creating the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. <!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

After briefly selling office equipment door-to-door one of his early clients, the then coffeehouse startup Starbucks, onboarded him as their marketing head in 1982. A business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] and the [[Coffee in Italy|country's coffee culture]] inspired him to open Il Giornale, a specialty coffeeshop that quickly merged with Starbucks during the late-1980s. Shultz pushed the new company to sell more than [[Coffee bean|coffee beans]] and equipment, quickly establishing a large network of stores that served [[espresso]], [[coffee]], teas, and casual food. Following large-scale distribution deals \u2013 particularly with major hotels, groceries, and bookstores \u2013 Starbucks became [[List of coffeehouse chains|the largest coffee-house chain]] in the world.<!--Cited in body.--> Shultz took the company [[Initial public offering|public]] in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count in a series of  highly publicized [[coffee wars]]. He stepped down in 2000 to focus on Starbuck's international expansion, succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]].<!--Second tenure as CEO, 2008 to 2017.-->\n\nDuring the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], Schultz returned as chief executive to stabilize the company after years of unsustainable growth. He led a mass-firing of executives, shuttered hundreds of weak stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. stores to retrain employees in making espresso. Shultz orchestrated multiple [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] of American and Chinese beverage companies and introduced a national [[loyalty program]]. His aggressive expansion in Chinese markets has been credited with reconciling [[Chinese tea culture|the country's tea-culture]] with [[Coffee production in China|coffee consumption in China]].

He served as the chairman and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee Corporation]] for more than two decades; first from 1986 to 2000, and then from 2008 to 2017. After stepping down as CEO, Schultz stayed at the company from 2017 to 2018 as its executive chairman overseeing Starbuck's philanthropic and charitable giving arm. From 2001 to 2006, he owned the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], a basketball franchise that he sold for [[United States dollar|US$]]350 million to [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who moved the team to Oklahoma creating the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. <!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

After briefly selling office equipment door-to-door one of his early clients, the then coffeehouse startup Starbucks, onboarded him as their marketing head in 1982. A business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] and the [[Coffee in Italy|country's coffee culture]] inspired him to open Il Giornale, a specialty coffeeshop that quickly merged with Starbucks during the late-1980s. Shultz pushed the new company to sell more than [[Coffee bean|coffee beans]] and equipment, quickly establishing a large network of stores that served [[espresso]], [[coffee]], teas, and casual food. Following large-scale distribution deals \u2013 particularly with major hotels, groceries, and bookstores \u2013 Starbucks became [[List of coffeehouse chains|the largest coffee-house chain]] in the world.<!--Cited in body.--> Shultz took the company [[Initial public offering|public]] in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count in a series of  highly publicized [[coffee wars]]. He stepped down in 2000 to focus on Starbuck's international expansion, succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]].<!--Second tenure as CEO, 2008 to 2017.-->\n\nDuring the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], Schultz returned as chief executive to stabilize the company after years of unsustainable growth. He led a mass-firing of executives, shuttered hundreds of weak stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. stores to retrain employees in making espresso. Shultz orchestrated multiple [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] of American and Chinese beverage companies and introduced a national [[loyalty program]]. His aggressive expansion in Chinese markets has been credited with reconciling [[Chinese tea culture|the country's tea-culture]] with [[Coffee production in China|coffee consumption in China]]. Schultz's positioning of Starbucks as a social hub is widely seen as introducing [[Third wave of coffee#History|the second wave]] of coffee culture in the U.S., particularly in Seattle. His second tenure sustained both [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant criticism]] and growth, ultimately adding nearly $100 billion in [[market capitalization]] to the company, a 21,000% increase in [[shareholder value]]. <!--Cited in body.-->Schultz was succeeded by [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] as CEO in April 2017, and has, since 2018, retained the title \"Chairman emeritus\" of Starbucks. \n\nSchultz was named the [[The World's Billionaires|145th-richest person in the United States]] by ''Forbes'' in 2019 with a [[net worth]] of $4.1 billion (November 2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-schultz/#6de1621452c6|title=Howard Schultz|website=Forbes|access-date=April 2, 2019|language=en}}</ref> He is the author of [[Howard Schultz#Books|three books]], ''Pour Your Heart Into It'' (1997), ''Onward'' (2011), and ''From the Ground Up'' (2019). Long known for his outspoken [[Centrism|centrist]], moderate, and independent political views, Schultz explored a run in the [[2020 United States presidential election]] as an independent candidate but declined to formally join the contest for fear of re-electing [[Donald Trump]]. Schultz supports nonpartisan immigration policy, [[free trade]], [[Balanced budget|fiscal discipline]], comprehensive tax reform, gun control, same-sex marriage, and more generally, [[bipartisanship]] across the political spectrum. To further his philanthropic efforts, he established the Schultz Family Foundation which focuses on [[Veteran#Health effects of military service and treatment for veterans|helping military veterans]] and fighting [[youth unemployment]].<!--Leave space for {{TOC}}.-->   \n\n== Early life and education ==\nSchultz was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family on July 19, 1953, in the [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn borough]] of New York,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/02/business/new-economy-starbucks-was-put-defensive-attack-internet-rumor-mill-that-would.html New York Times: \"New Economy; How Starbucks was put on the defensive by an attack on the Internet rumor mill that would not go away\" By Sherri Day] June 2, 2003</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/howard-schultz-i-raise-my-frappuccino-to-the-brits-1655293.html|title=Howard Schultz: I raise my frappuccino to the Brits|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=June 4, 2018}}</ref> the son of Elaine (Lederman) and her husband, ex-[[United States Army]] soldier and then truck driver Fred Schultz.<ref name=\"Mirror22464724\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/08/05/starbucks-howard-schultz-on-how-he-became-coffee-king-115875-22464724/|title= Starbucks' Howard Schultz on how he became coffee king|author=Melissa Thompson|publisher=Sunday Mirror|date=August 5, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Koehn\">Howard is constantly reminding his team, \"We are not in the coffee business serving people; we are in the people business serving coffee.\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20140104040308/http://skellogg.sdsmt.edu/IE354/Supplement/howars_s.pdf Kellogg School of Management: \"Howard Schultz and Starbucks Coffee Company\" by] [[Nancy Koehn|Nancy F.

After being ruled by the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]] for two centuries, the independent [[Zeta under the Bal\u0161i\u0107i|Principality of Zeta]] emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries, ruled by the [[House of Bal\u0161i\u0107]] between 1356 and 1421, and by the [[House of Crnojevi\u0107]] between 1431 and 1498, when the name Montenegro started being used for the country. After falling under [[Montenegro Vilayet|Ottoman rule]], Montenegro regained ''de facto'' independence in 1697 under the rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]], first under the theocratic rule of [[Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro|prince-bishops]], before being transformed into a secular [[Principality of Montenegro|principality]] in 1852. Montenegro's ''[[de jure]]'' independence was recognised by the [[Great Powers]] at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, following the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War]]. In 1905, the country became a [[Kingdom of Montenegro|kingdom]]. After [[World War I]], it became part of [[Yugoslavia]]. Following the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], the republics of [[Republic of Serbia (1992\u20132006)|Serbia]] and [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|Montenegro]] together established a federation known as the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which was renamed to the [[Serbia and Montenegro|State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003. On the basis of an [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|independence referendum]] held in May 2006, Montenegro declared independence and the federation peacefully dissolved on 3 June of that year, ending a nearly 88-year union between the two states.<ref>[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/serbia-ends-union-with-montenegro-1.785687 Serbia ends union with Montenegro<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSince 1990, the state of Montenegro has been governed by the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] and its minor coalition partners. Classified by the [[World Bank]] as an upper middle-income country, Montenegro is a member of the UN, [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], the [[Council of Europe]], and the [[Central European Free Trade Agreement]]. It is a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe country's English name derives from [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and translates as \"Black Mountain\", deriving from the appearance of [[Lov\u0107en|Mount Lov\u0107en]] when covered in dense evergreen forests.<ref name=\"visit-montenegro\">{{cite web |title=Montenegro History \u2013 Part I |url=https://www.visit-montenegro.com/montenegro/history/ |website=visit-montenegro.com |accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref> In the monuments of [[Kotor]], Montenegro was mentioned as Montenegro in 1397, as Monte Nigro in 1443 and as Crna Gora in 1435 and 1458, but there are much older papers of Latin sources where Montenegro is mentioned as Monte nigro. The first mention of Montenegro (as Monte nigro) dates to 9 November 1053 in a papal epistle and the others date to 1061, 1097, 1121, 1125, 1144, 1154, 1179 and 1189.<ref name=\"maticacrnogorska\">{{cite web  |title=PRVI POMENI CRNE GORE - Marijan Ma\u0161o Milji\u0107 |url=http://www.maticacrnogorska.me/matica67.html |website=www.maticacrnogorska.me}}</ref>\n\nThe native name ''Crna Gora,'' also meaning \"black mountain,\" came to denote the majority of contemporary Montenegro in the 15th century.<ref name=Fine532>{{harvnb|Fine|1994|p=532}}</ref> Originally, it had referred to only a small strip of land under the rule of the [[Pa\u0161trovi\u0107i]], but the name eventually came to be used for the wider mountainous region after the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]] took power in [[Upper Zeta]].<ref name=Fine532 /> The aforementioned region became known as ''Stara Crna Gora'' '[[Old Montenegro]]' by the 19th century to distinguish the independent region from the neighbouring Ottoman-occupied Montenegrin territory of ''Brda'' '(The) Highlands'. Montenegro further increased its size several times by the 20th century, as the result of wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]], which saw the annexation of [[Old Herzegovina]] and parts of [[Metohija]] and southern [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Ra\u0161ka]]. Its borders have changed little since then, losing [[Metohija]] and gaining the [[Bay of Kotor]].\n \nAfter the second session of the [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia|AVNOJ]] during [[World War II in Yugoslavia]], the modern state of Montenegro was founded as the ''[[Federal State of Montenegro]]'' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435 / ''Savezna dr\u017eava Crne Gore'') on 15 November 1943 within the [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] by the [[State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Montenegro and Boka|ZAVNOCGB]]. After Democratic Federal Yugoslavia became the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FPRY), the Federal State of Montenegro was renamed to the ''[[People's Republic of Montenegro]]'' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / ''Narodna Republika Crna Gora'') on 29 November 1945.

Over the next few decades, it expanded its territory to neighbouring Rascia and Bosnia, and also became recognised as a kingdom. Its power started declining at the beginning of the 12th century. After King Bodin's death (in 1101 or 1108), several civil wars ensued. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, [[Mihailo I of Duklja|Mihailo]] (1046\u201381), and his grandson [[Constantine Bodin]] (1081\u20131101).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970116032145/http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 January 1997 |title=Duklja, the first Montenegrin state |publisher=Montenegro.org |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref> \n\n[[File:\u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043a \u0426\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0430.jpg|thumb|upright|Uprising against the [[Ottoman Empire]], 1878, painted by [[\u0110ura Jak\u0161i\u0107]]]]\nBy the 13th century, ''Zeta'' had replaced ''Duklja'' when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro ([[Lordship of Zeta|Zeta]]) came under the rule of the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family]], then the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]], and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as ''Crna Gora'' ([[Venetian language|Venetian]]: ''{{lang|vec|monte negro}}'').\n\nAs the nobility fought for the throne, the kingdom was weakened, and by 1186, it was conquered by [[Stefan Nemanja]] and incorporated into the [[History of Serbia|Serbian realm]] as a province named Zeta. After the [[Serbian Empire]] collapsed in the second half of the 14th century, the most powerful Zetan family, the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107]]s, became sovereigns of Zeta.\n\nIn 1421, Zeta was annexed to the [[Serbian Despotate]], but after 1455, another noble family from Zeta, the [[Crnojevi\u0107]]s, became sovereign rulers of the country, making it the last free monarchy of the Balkans before it fell to the [[Ottomans]] in 1496, and got annexed to the ''[[sanjak]]'' of [[Shkod\u00ebr]]. During the reign of Crnojevi\u0107s, Zeta became known under its current name&nbsp;\u2013 Montenegro. For a short time, Montenegro existed as a separate autonomous ''sanjak'' in 1514\u20131528 ([[Sanjak of Montenegro]]).

In the 16th century, Montenegro developed a unique form of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire permitting Montenegrin clans freedom from certain restrictions. Nevertheless, the Montenegrins were disgruntled with Ottoman rule, and in the 17th century, raised numerous rebellions, which culminated in the defeat of the Ottomans in the [[Great Turkish War]] at the end of that century.\n\nMontenegro consisted of territories controlled by warlike clans. Most clans had a chieftain (''knez''), who was not permitted to assume the title unless he proved to be as worthy a leader as his predecessor. The great assembly of Montenegrin clans (''Zbor'') was held every year on 12 July in Cetinje, and any adult clansman could take part.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nParts of the territory were controlled by [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[First French Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], its successors. In 1515, Montenegro became a [[theocracy]] led by the [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral]], which flourished after the [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] of Cetinje became the traditional prince-bishops (whose title was \"Vladika of Montenegro\"). However, the [[Venetian Republic]] introduced governors who meddled in Montenegrin politics. The republic was succeeded by the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1797, and the governors were abolished by Prince-Bishop [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar II]] in 1832.

Minor border skirmishes excepted, diplomacy ushered in about 30 years of peace between the two states until the deposition of [[Abdul Hamid II]] in 1909.<ref name=\"ttk.gov.tr\">U\u011fur \u00d6zcan, [http://www.ttk.gov.tr/index.php?Page=Yayinlar&KitapNo=989 II.

However, political rifts emerged between the reigning [[People's Party of Montenegro|People's Party]], who supported the process of democratization and union with Serbia, and those of the [[True People's Party]], who were monarchist.\n\nIn 1858 one of the major Montenegrin victories over the Ottomans occurred at the\n[[Battle of Grahovac]]. [[Mirko Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161|Grand Duke Mirko Petrovi\u0107]], elder brother of [[Knjaz Danilo]], led an army of 7,500 and defeated the numerically superior Ottomans (who had 15,000 troops) at [[Grahovac]] on 1 May 1858. The glory of Montenegrin victory was soon immortalized in the songs and literature of all the South Slavs, in particular the Montenegrins in Vojvodina,{{citation needed|date= June 2019}} then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. This forced the [[Great Powers]] to officially demarcate the borders between Montenegro and Ottoman Empire, ''de facto'' recognizing Montenegro's independence. The Ottoman Empire recognized Montenegrin independence in the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.\n\nThe first Montenegrin constitution (also known as the Danilo Code) was proclaimed in 1855.\n\n[[File:Kralj i kraljica u krugu sire familije.jpg|thumb|[[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Royal family of Montenegro]]: King [[Nikola I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Nicholas I]] with his wife, sons, daughters, grandchildren and sons- and daughters-in-law]]\n\nIn 1910 Montenegro became [[Kingdom of Montenegro|a kingdom]], and as a result of the [[Balkan wars]] in 1912 and 1913 (in which the Ottomans lost most of their Balkan lands), a common border with Serbia was established, with [[Shkod\u00ebr]] being awarded to a newly-created [[Albania]], though the current capital city of Montenegro, Podgorica, was on the old border of Albania and Yugoslavia.\n\nMontenegro became one of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] during [[World War I]] (1914\u201318). From 1916 to October 1918 Austria-Hungary occupied Montenegro. During the occupation, King Nicholas fled the country and a government-in-exile was set up in [[Bordeaux]].\n\n=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}}\n\nIn 1922, Montenegro formally became the [[Oblast of Cetinje]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], with the addition of the coastal areas around [[Budva]] and [[Bay of Kotor]]. In a further restructuring in 1929, it became a part of a larger [[Zeta Banovina|Zeta Banate]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] that reached the [[Neretva]] River.\n\nNicholas's grandson, the Serb King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]], dominated the Yugoslav government. Zeta Banovina was one of nine banovinas which formed the kingdom; it consisted of the present-day Montenegro and parts of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia.\n\n=== World War II and Socialist Yugoslavia===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Main|Italian governorate of Montenegro|Socialist Republic of Montenegro}}\n[[File:Crna Gora - Oslobodjenje od strane okupacije 1711-1918.png|thumb|left|Expansion of Montenegro from 1711 to 1918]]\n\nIn April 1941, [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and other Axis allies attacked and occupied the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Italian forces occupied Montenegro and established it as a puppet [[Italian governorate of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro]].\n\nIn May, the Montenegrin branch of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia started preparations for an uprising planned for mid-July. The Communist Party and its Youth League organised 6,000 of its members into detachments prepared for [[guerrilla warfare]]. The first armed uprising in [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-occupied Europe happened on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2010&mm=07&dd=13&nav_category=167&nav_id=445290 |title=Prema oceni istori\u010dara, Trinaestojulski ustanak bio je prvi i najmasovniji oru\u017eani otpor u porobljenoj Evropi 1941. godine |publisher=B92.net |language=Serbian |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnexpectedly, the uprising took hold, and by 20 July, 32,000 men and women had joined the fight. Except for the coast and major towns (Podgorica, Cetinje, Pljevlja, and Nik\u0161i\u0107), which were besieged, Montenegro was mostly liberated. In a month of fighting, the Italian army suffered 5,000 dead, wounded, and captured. The uprising lasted until mid-August, when it was suppressed by a counter-offensive of 67,000 Italian troops brought in from Albania. Faced with new and overwhelming Italian forces, many of the fighters laid down their arms and returned home. Nevertheless, intense guerrilla fighting lasted until December.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-185-0116-27A, Bucht von Kotor (-), jugoslawische Schiffe.jpg|thumb|Captured ships of the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy|Yugoslavian Navy]], [[Bay of Kotor]] 1941.]]\n[[File:Borbe_za_oslobo\u0111enje_Crne_Gore.jpg|thumb|Liberation of Montenegro in World War II]]\n\nFighters who remained under arms fractured into two groups. Most of them went on to join the Yugoslav Partisans, consisting of communists and those inclined towards active resistance; these included [[Arso Jovanovi\u0107]], [[Sava Kova\u010devi\u0107 (Yugoslav Partisan)|Sava Kova\u010devi\u0107]], [[Svetozar Vukmanovi\u0107-Tempo]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]], [[Peko Dap\u010devi\u0107]], [[Vlado Dap\u010devi\u0107]], [[Veljko Vlahovi\u0107]], and [[Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107]]. Those loyal to the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]] and opposing communism went on to become [[Chetniks]], and turned to collaboration with Italians against the Partisans.\n\nWar broke out between Partisans and Chetniks during the first half of 1942. Pressured by Italians and Chetniks, the core of the Montenegrin Partisans went to Serbia and Bosnia, where they joined with other Yugoslav Partisans. Fighting between Partisans and Chetniks continued through the war. Chetniks with Italian backing controlled most of the country from mid-1942 to April 1943. Montenegrin Chetniks received the status of \"anti-communist militia\" and received weapons, ammunition, food rations, and money from Italy. Most of them were moved to [[Mostar]], where they fought in the [[Battle of Neretva]] against the Partisans, but were dealt a heavy defeat.\n\nDuring the German operation Schwartz against the Partisans in May and June 1943, Germans disarmed large number of Chetniks without fighting, as they feared they would turn against them in case of an Allied invasion of the Balkans. After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Partisans managed to take hold of most of Montenegro for a brief time, but Montenegro was soon [[German occupied territory of Montenegro|occupied by German forces]], and fierce fighting continued during late 1943 and entire 1944. Montenegro was liberated by the Partisans in December 1944.\n\nMontenegro became one of the six constituent republics of the communist [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY). Its capital became Podgorica, renamed [[Titograd]] in honour of President [[Josip Broz Tito]]. After the war, the infrastructure of Yugoslavia was rebuilt, industrialization began, and the [[University of Montenegro]] was established. Greater autonomy was established until the [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]] ratified a new constitution in 1974.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n=== Montenegro within FR Yugoslavia ===\n{{Main|Serbia and Montenegro|Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)}}\nAfter the dissolution of the SFRY in 1992, Montenegro remained part of a smaller [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] along with Serbia.\n\nIn the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 1992|referendum on remaining in Yugoslavia in 1992]], the turnout was 66%, with 96% of the votes cast in favour of the federation with Serbia.

The opponents claimed that the poll was organized under anti-[[Democracy|democratic conditions]] with widespread propaganda from the state-controlled media in favour of a pro-federation vote.

Despite an extensive road network, no roads are built to full motorway standards. Construction of new motorways is considered a national priority, as they are important for uniform regional economic development and the development of Montenegro as an attractive tourist destination.\n\nCurrent [[European route]]s that pass through Montenegro are [[European route E65|E65]] and [[European route E80|E80]].\n\nThe backbone of the Montenegrin rail network is the [[Belgrade\u2013Bar railway]], which provides international connection towards [[Serbia]]. There is a domestic branch line, the [[Nik\u0161i\u0107-Podgorica railway]], which was operated as a freight-only line for decades, and is now also open for passenger traffic after the reconstruction and electrification works in 2012. The other branch line from Podgorica towards the Albanian border, the [[Podgorica\u2013Shkod\u00ebr railway]], is not in use.\n\nMontenegro has two international airports, [[Podgorica Airport]] and [[Tivat Airport]]. The two airports served 1.1&nbsp;million passengers in 2008. [[Montenegro Airlines]] is the flag carrier of Montenegro.\n\nThe [[Port of Bar]] is Montenegro's main seaport. Initially built in 1906, the port was almost completely destroyed during [[World War II]], with reconstruction beginning in 1950. Today, it is equipped to handle over 5 million tons of cargo annually, though the breakup of the former Yugoslavia and the size of the Montenegrin industrial sector has resulted in the port operating at a loss and well below capacity for several years. The reconstruction of the [[Belgrade-Bar railway]] and the proposed [[Belgrade-Bar motorway]] are expected to bring the port back up to capacity.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{Main|Tourism in Montenegro}}\n[[File:Widok na Perast z zachodu 01.JPG|thumb|[[Perast]] in the [[Bay of Kotor]]]]\n[[File:Sveti Stefan (06).jpg|thumb|[[Sveti Stefan]]]]\nMontenegro has both a picturesque coast and a mountainous northern region.

It is a national strategy to make tourism a major contributor to the Montenegrin economy. A number of steps were taken to attract foreign investors. Some large projects are already under way, such as [[Porto Montenegro]], while other locations, like [[Jaz Beach]], [[Buljarica]], [[Velika Pla\u017ea]] and [[Ada Bojana]], have perhaps the greatest potential to attract future investments and become premium tourist spots on the [[Adriatic]].\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Montenegro|Demographic history of Montenegro}}\n\n=== Ethnic structure ===\n[[File:MontenegroEthnic2011.PNG|thumb|upright=0.8|Predominant ethnic group in each municipality of Montenegro, 2011.]]\nAccording to the 2003 census, Montenegro has 620,145 citizens.

Children enroll in elementary schools ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: ''Osnovna \u0161kola'') at the age of 6; it lasts 9 years. The students may continue their secondary education ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: ''Srednja \u0161kola''), which lasts 4 years (3 years for trade schools) and ends with graduation ([[Matura]]). Higher education lasts with a certain first degree after 3 to 6 years. There is one public university ([[University of Montenegro]]) and two private ones ([[Mediterranean University]] and [[University of Donja Gorica]]).\n\n=== Elementary and secondary education ===\nElementary education in Montenegro is free and compulsory for all the children between the ages of 7 and 15 when children attend the \"eight-year school\".\n\nVarious types of elementary education are available to all who qualify, but the vocational and technical schools (gymnasiums), where the students follow four-year course which will take them up to the university entrance, are the most popular. At the secondary level there are a number of art schools, apprentice schools and teacher training schools. Those who have attended the technical schools may pursue their education further at one of two-year post-secondary schools, created in response to the needs of industry and the social services.\n\nSecondary schools are divided in three types, and children attend one depending on choice and primary school grades:\n\n* [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (Gimnazija / \u0413\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438j\u0430) lasts for four years and offers a general, broad education.

His Nero Wolfe novel \"[[The Black Mountain (novel)|The Black Mountain]]\" was largely set in Montenegro during the 1950s.\n\n=== Media ===\n{{Main|Media of Montenegro}}\nThe media of Montenegro refers to mass media outlets based in Montenegro. Television, magazines, and newspapers are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on advertising, [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. The [[Constitution of Montenegro]] guarantees freedom of speech.\nAs a [[country in transition]], Montenegro's media system is under transformation.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Montenegrin cuisine}}\n[[File:Foods from Montenegro.jpg|thumb|Foods from Montenegro]]\nMontenegrin cuisine is a result of Montenegro's long history. It is a variation of Mediterranean and Oriental. The most influence is from Italy, [[Turkey]], [[Byzantine Empire]]/[[Greece]], and Hungary. Montenegrin cuisine also varies geographically; the cuisine in the coastal area differs from the one in the northern highland region. The coastal area is traditionally a representative of [[Mediterranean cuisine]], with seafood being a common dish, while the northern represents more the Oriental.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Montenegro}}\n[[File:Nikola Vucevic Dec 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107]], a professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Orlando Magic]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] ([[NBA]]).]]\n\nThe '''Sports in Montenegro''' revolves mostly around team sports, such as [[Association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[water polo]], [[volleyball]], and [[Team handball|handball]].

After being ruled by the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]] for two centuries, the independent [[Zeta under the Bal\u0161i\u0107i|Principality of Zeta]] emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries, ruled by the [[House of Bal\u0161i\u0107]] between 1356 and 1421, and by the [[House of Crnojevi\u0107]] between 1431 and 1498, when the name Montenegro started being used for the country. After falling under [[Montenegro Vilayet|Ottoman rule]], Montenegro regained ''de facto'' independence in 1697 under the rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]], first under the theocratic rule of [[Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro|prince-bishops]], before being transformed into a secular [[Principality of Montenegro|principality]] in 1852. Montenegro's ''[[de jure]]'' independence was recognised by the [[Great Powers]] at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, following the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War]]. In 1905, the country became a [[Kingdom of Montenegro|kingdom]]. After [[World War I]], it became part of [[Yugoslavia]]. Following the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], the republics of [[Republic of Serbia (1992\u20132006)|Serbia]] and [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|Montenegro]] together established a federation known as the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which was renamed to the [[Serbia and Montenegro|State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003. On the basis of an [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|independence referendum]] held in May 2006, Montenegro declared independence and the federation peacefully dissolved on 3 June of that year, ending a nearly 88-year union between the two states.<ref>[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/serbia-ends-union-with-montenegro-1.785687 Serbia ends union with Montenegro<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nSince 1990, the state of Montenegro has been governed by the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] and its minor coalition partners. Classified by the [[World Bank]] as an upper middle-income country, Montenegro is a member of the UN, [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], the [[Council of Europe]], and the [[Central European Free Trade Agreement]]. It is a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe country's English name derives from [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and translates as \"Black Mountain\", deriving from the appearance of [[Lov\u0107en|Mount Lov\u0107en]] when covered in dense evergreen forests.<ref name=\"visit-montenegro\">{{cite web |title=Montenegro History \u2013 Part I |url=https://www.visit-montenegro.com/montenegro/history/ |website=visit-montenegro.com |accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref> In the monuments of [[Kotor]], Montenegro was mentioned as Montenegro in 1397, as Monte Nigro in 1443 and as Crna Gora in 1435 and 1458, but there are much older papers of Latin sources where Montenegro is mentioned as Monte nigro. The first mention of Montenegro (as Monte nigro) dates to 9 November 1053 in a papal epistle and the others date to 1061, 1097, 1121, 1125, 1144, 1154, 1179 and 1189.<ref name=\"maticacrnogorska\">{{cite web  |title=PRVI POMENI CRNE GORE - Marijan Ma\u0161o Milji\u0107 |url=http://www.maticacrnogorska.me/matica67.html |website=www.maticacrnogorska.me}}</ref>\n\nThe native name ''Crna Gora,'' also meaning \"black mountain,\" came to denote the majority of contemporary Montenegro in the 15th century.<ref name=Fine532>{{harvnb|Fine|1994|p=532}}</ref> Originally, it had referred to only a small strip of land under the rule of the [[Pa\u0161trovi\u0107i]], but the name eventually came to be used for the wider mountainous region after the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]] took power in [[Upper Zeta]].<ref name=Fine532 /> The aforementioned region became known as ''Stara Crna Gora'' '[[Old Montenegro]]' by the 19th century to distinguish the independent region from the neighbouring Ottoman-occupied Montenegrin territory of ''Brda'' '(The) Highlands'. Montenegro further increased its size several times by the 20th century, as the result of wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]], which saw the annexation of [[Old Herzegovina]] and parts of [[Metohija]] and southern [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Ra\u0161ka]]. Its borders have changed little since then, losing [[Metohija]] and gaining the [[Bay of Kotor]].\n \nAfter the second session of the [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia|AVNOJ]] during [[World War II in Yugoslavia]], the modern state of Montenegro was founded as the ''[[Federal State of Montenegro]]'' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435 / ''Savezna dr\u017eava Crne Gore'') on 15 November 1943 within the [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] by the [[State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Montenegro and Boka|ZAVNOCGB]]. After Democratic Federal Yugoslavia became the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FPRY), the Federal State of Montenegro was renamed to the ''[[People's Republic of Montenegro]]'' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / ''Narodna Republika Crna Gora'') on 29 November 1945. In 1963, the FPRY was renamed to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and coincidentally, the People's Republic of Montenegro was renamed to the ''[[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]]''  ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / ''Socijalisti\u010dka Republika Crna Gora'').

This name was briefly kept after declaration of independence.

Over the next few decades, it expanded its territory to neighbouring Rascia and Bosnia, and also became recognised as a kingdom. Its power started declining at the beginning of the 12th century. After King Bodin's death (in 1101 or 1108), several civil wars ensued. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, [[Mihailo I of Duklja|Mihailo]] (1046\u201381), and his grandson [[Constantine Bodin]] (1081\u20131101).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970116032145/http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 January 1997 |title=Duklja, the first Montenegrin state |publisher=Montenegro.org |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref> \n\n[[File:\u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043a \u0426\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0430.jpg|thumb|upright|Uprising against the [[Ottoman Empire]], 1878, painted by [[\u0110ura Jak\u0161i\u0107]]]]\nBy the 13th century, ''Zeta'' had replaced ''Duklja'' when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro ([[Lordship of Zeta|Zeta]]) came under the rule of the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family]], then the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]], and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as ''Crna Gora'' ([[Venetian language|Venetian]]: ''{{lang|vec|monte negro}}'').\n\nAs the nobility fought for the throne, the kingdom was weakened, and by 1186, it was conquered by [[Stefan Nemanja]] and incorporated into the [[History of Serbia|Serbian realm]] as a province named Zeta. After the [[Serbian Empire]] collapsed in the second half of the 14th century, the most powerful Zetan family, the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107]]s, became sovereigns of Zeta.\n\nIn 1421, Zeta was annexed to the [[Serbian Despotate]], but after 1455, another noble family from Zeta, the [[Crnojevi\u0107]]s, became sovereign rulers of the country, making it the last free monarchy of the Balkans before it fell to the [[Ottomans]] in 1496, and got annexed to the ''[[sanjak]]'' of [[Shkod\u00ebr]]. During the reign of Crnojevi\u0107s, Zeta became known under its current name&nbsp;\u2013 Montenegro. For a short time, Montenegro existed as a separate autonomous ''sanjak'' in 1514\u20131528 ([[Sanjak of Montenegro]]). Also, [[Old Herzegovina]] region was part of [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]].\n\n=== Ottoman period ===\n{{Main|Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro}}\n{{multiple image\n| footer = '''Left:''' [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] was the most popular spiritual and military leader from the [[Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]]. <br />'''Right:''' [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] was a [[List of rulers of Montenegro|Prince-Bishop]] (''vladika'') of Montenegro and the national poet and philosopher, Oil painting of Njego\u0161 as vladika, c.\u2009[[1837]]| width1 = 150\n| image1 = Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 \u0417\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438 XIX. \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430.jpg \n| width2 = \n| image2 = \n| width3 = 143\n| image3 = Njegosh_vladika.jpg\n| align = \n| direction = \n| total_width = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\nLarge portions fell under the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1496 to 1878. In the 16th century, Montenegro developed a unique form of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire permitting Montenegrin clans freedom from certain restrictions. Nevertheless, the Montenegrins were disgruntled with Ottoman rule, and in the 17th century, raised numerous rebellions, which culminated in the defeat of the Ottomans in the [[Great Turkish War]] at the end of that century.\n\nMontenegro consisted of territories controlled by warlike clans. Most clans had a chieftain (''knez''), who was not permitted to assume the title unless he proved to be as worthy a leader as his predecessor. The great assembly of Montenegrin clans (''Zbor'') was held every year on 12 July in Cetinje, and any adult clansman could take part.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nParts of the territory were controlled by [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[First French Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], its successors. In 1515, Montenegro became a [[theocracy]] led by the [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral]], which flourished after the [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] of Cetinje became the traditional prince-bishops (whose title was \"Vladika of Montenegro\"). However, the [[Venetian Republic]] introduced governors who meddled in Montenegrin politics. The republic was succeeded by the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1797, and the governors were abolished by Prince-Bishop [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar II]] in 1832. His predecessor [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar I]] contributed to the unification of Montenegro with the Highlands.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n=== Principality and Kingdom of Montenegro===\n{{Main|Principality of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro}}\n[[File:Battle of Vu\u010dji Do, Orao, 1877.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Vu\u010dji Do]], 1876]]\nUnder [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nicholas I]] (ruled 1860-1918), the [[principality]] was enlarged several times in the Montenegro-Turkish Wars and was recognised as independent in 1878. Nicholas I established diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire. Minor border skirmishes excepted, diplomacy ushered in about 30 years of peace between the two states until the deposition of [[Abdul Hamid II]] in 1909.<ref name=\"ttk.gov.tr\">U\u011fur \u00d6zcan, [http://www.ttk.gov.tr/index.php?Page=Yayinlar&KitapNo=989 II.

However, political rifts emerged between the reigning [[People's Party of Montenegro|People's Party]], who supported the process of democratization and union with Serbia, and those of the [[True People's Party]], who were monarchist.\n\nIn 1858 one of the major Montenegrin victories over the Ottomans occurred at the\n[[Battle of Grahovac]]. [[Mirko Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161|Grand Duke Mirko Petrovi\u0107]], elder brother of [[Knjaz Danilo]], led an army of 7,500 and defeated the numerically superior Ottomans (who had 15,000 troops) at [[Grahovac]] on 1 May 1858. The glory of Montenegrin victory was soon immortalized in the songs and literature of all the South Slavs, in particular the Montenegrins in Vojvodina,{{citation needed|date= June 2019}} then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. This forced the [[Great Powers]] to officially demarcate the borders between Montenegro and Ottoman Empire, ''de facto'' recognizing Montenegro's independence. The Ottoman Empire recognized Montenegrin independence in the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.\n\nThe first Montenegrin constitution (also known as the Danilo Code) was proclaimed in 1855.\n\n[[File:Kralj i kraljica u krugu sire familije.jpg|thumb|[[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Royal family of Montenegro]]: King [[Nikola I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Nicholas I]] with his wife, sons, daughters, grandchildren and sons- and daughters-in-law]]\n\nIn 1910 Montenegro became [[Kingdom of Montenegro|a kingdom]], and as a result of the [[Balkan wars]] in 1912 and 1913 (in which the Ottomans lost most of their Balkan lands), a common border with Serbia was established, with [[Shkod\u00ebr]] being awarded to a newly-created [[Albania]], though the current capital city of Montenegro, Podgorica, was on the old border of Albania and Yugoslavia.\n\nMontenegro became one of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] during [[World War I]] (1914\u201318). From 1916 to October 1918 Austria-Hungary occupied Montenegro. During the occupation, King Nicholas fled the country and a government-in-exile was set up in [[Bordeaux]].\n\n=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}}\n\nIn 1922, Montenegro formally became the [[Oblast of Cetinje]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], with the addition of the coastal areas around [[Budva]] and [[Bay of Kotor]]. In a further restructuring in 1929, it became a part of a larger [[Zeta Banovina|Zeta Banate]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] that reached the [[Neretva]] River.\n\nNicholas's grandson, the Serb King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]], dominated the Yugoslav government. Zeta Banovina was one of nine banovinas which formed the kingdom; it consisted of the present-day Montenegro and parts of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia.\n\n=== World War II and Socialist Yugoslavia===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Main|Italian governorate of Montenegro|Socialist Republic of Montenegro}}\n[[File:Crna Gora - Oslobodjenje od strane okupacije 1711-1918.png|thumb|left|Expansion of Montenegro from 1711 to 1918]]\n\nIn April 1941, [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and other Axis allies attacked and occupied the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Italian forces occupied Montenegro and established it as a puppet [[Italian governorate of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro]].\n\nIn May, the Montenegrin branch of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia started preparations for an uprising planned for mid-July. The Communist Party and its Youth League organised 6,000 of its members into detachments prepared for [[guerrilla warfare]]. The first armed uprising in [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-occupied Europe happened on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2010&mm=07&dd=13&nav_category=167&nav_id=445290 |title=Prema oceni istori\u010dara, Trinaestojulski ustanak bio je prvi i najmasovniji oru\u017eani otpor u porobljenoj Evropi 1941. godine |publisher=B92.net |language=Serbian |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnexpectedly, the uprising took hold, and by 20 July, 32,000 men and women had joined the fight. Except for the coast and major towns (Podgorica, Cetinje, Pljevlja, and Nik\u0161i\u0107), which were besieged, Montenegro was mostly liberated. In a month of fighting, the Italian army suffered 5,000 dead, wounded, and captured. The uprising lasted until mid-August, when it was suppressed by a counter-offensive of 67,000 Italian troops brought in from Albania. Faced with new and overwhelming Italian forces, many of the fighters laid down their arms and returned home. Nevertheless, intense guerrilla fighting lasted until December.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-185-0116-27A, Bucht von Kotor (-), jugoslawische Schiffe.jpg|thumb|Captured ships of the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy|Yugoslavian Navy]], [[Bay of Kotor]] 1941.]]\n[[File:Borbe_za_oslobo\u0111enje_Crne_Gore.jpg|thumb|Liberation of Montenegro in World War II]]\n\nFighters who remained under arms fractured into two groups. Most of them went on to join the Yugoslav Partisans, consisting of communists and those inclined towards active resistance; these included [[Arso Jovanovi\u0107]], [[Sava Kova\u010devi\u0107 (Yugoslav Partisan)|Sava Kova\u010devi\u0107]], [[Svetozar Vukmanovi\u0107-Tempo]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]], [[Peko Dap\u010devi\u0107]], [[Vlado Dap\u010devi\u0107]], [[Veljko Vlahovi\u0107]], and [[Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107]]. Those loyal to the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]] and opposing communism went on to become [[Chetniks]], and turned to collaboration with Italians against the Partisans.\n\nWar broke out between Partisans and Chetniks during the first half of 1942. Pressured by Italians and Chetniks, the core of the Montenegrin Partisans went to Serbia and Bosnia, where they joined with other Yugoslav Partisans. Fighting between Partisans and Chetniks continued through the war. Chetniks with Italian backing controlled most of the country from mid-1942 to April 1943. Montenegrin Chetniks received the status of \"anti-communist militia\" and received weapons, ammunition, food rations, and money from Italy. Most of them were moved to [[Mostar]], where they fought in the [[Battle of Neretva]] against the Partisans, but were dealt a heavy defeat.\n\nDuring the German operation Schwartz against the Partisans in May and June 1943, Germans disarmed large number of Chetniks without fighting, as they feared they would turn against them in case of an Allied invasion of the Balkans. After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Partisans managed to take hold of most of Montenegro for a brief time, but Montenegro was soon [[German occupied territory of Montenegro|occupied by German forces]], and fierce fighting continued during late 1943 and entire 1944. Montenegro was liberated by the Partisans in December 1944.\n\nMontenegro became one of the six constituent republics of the communist [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY). Its capital became Podgorica, renamed [[Titograd]] in honour of President [[Josip Broz Tito]]. After the war, the infrastructure of Yugoslavia was rebuilt, industrialization began, and the [[University of Montenegro]] was established. Greater autonomy was established until the [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]] ratified a new constitution in 1974.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n=== Montenegro within FR Yugoslavia ===\n{{Main|Serbia and Montenegro|Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)}}\nAfter the dissolution of the SFRY in 1992, Montenegro remained part of a smaller [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] along with Serbia.\n\nIn the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 1992|referendum on remaining in Yugoslavia in 1992]], the turnout was 66%, with 96% of the votes cast in favour of the federation with Serbia.

The opponents claimed that the poll was organized under anti-[[Democracy|democratic conditions]] with widespread propaganda from the state-controlled media in favour of a pro-federation vote.

Despite an extensive road network, no roads are built to full motorway standards. Construction of new motorways is considered a national priority, as they are important for uniform regional economic development and the development of Montenegro as an attractive tourist destination.\n\nCurrent [[European route]]s that pass through Montenegro are [[European route E65|E65]] and [[European route E80|E80]].\n\nThe backbone of the Montenegrin rail network is the [[Belgrade\u2013Bar railway]], which provides international connection towards [[Serbia]].

The other branch line from Podgorica towards the Albanian border, the [[Podgorica\u2013Shkod\u00ebr railway]], is not in use.\n\nMontenegro has two international airports, [[Podgorica Airport]] and [[Tivat Airport]]. The two airports served 1.1&nbsp;million passengers in 2008. [[Montenegro Airlines]] is the flag carrier of Montenegro.\n\nThe [[Port of Bar]] is Montenegro's main seaport. Initially built in 1906, the port was almost completely destroyed during [[World War II]], with reconstruction beginning in 1950. Today, it is equipped to handle over 5 million tons of cargo annually, though the breakup of the former Yugoslavia and the size of the Montenegrin industrial sector has resulted in the port operating at a loss and well below capacity for several years. The reconstruction of the [[Belgrade-Bar railway]] and the proposed [[Belgrade-Bar motorway]] are expected to bring the port back up to capacity.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{Main|Tourism in Montenegro}}\n[[File:Widok na Perast z zachodu 01.JPG|thumb|[[Perast]] in the [[Bay of Kotor]]]]\n[[File:Sveti Stefan (06).jpg|thumb|[[Sveti Stefan]]]]\nMontenegro has both a picturesque coast and a mountainous northern region.

Children enroll in elementary schools ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: ''Osnovna \u0161kola'') at the age of 6; it lasts 9 years. The students may continue their secondary education ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: ''Srednja \u0161kola''), which lasts 4 years (3 years for trade schools) and ends with graduation ([[Matura]]). Higher education lasts with a certain first degree after 3 to 6 years. There is one public university ([[University of Montenegro]]) and two private ones ([[Mediterranean University]] and [[University of Donja Gorica]]).\n\n=== Elementary and secondary education ===\nElementary education in Montenegro is free and compulsory for all the children between the ages of 7 and 15 when children attend the \"eight-year school\".\n\nVarious types of elementary education are available to all who qualify, but the vocational and technical schools (gymnasiums), where the students follow four-year course which will take them up to the university entrance, are the most popular. At the secondary level there are a number of art schools, apprentice schools and teacher training schools. Those who have attended the technical schools may pursue their education further at one of two-year post-secondary schools, created in response to the needs of industry and the social services.\n\nSecondary schools are divided in three types, and children attend one depending on choice and primary school grades:\n\n* [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (Gimnazija / \u0413\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438j\u0430) lasts for four years and offers a general, broad education.

His Nero Wolfe novel \"[[The Black Mountain (novel)|The Black Mountain]]\" was largely set in Montenegro during the 1950s.\n\n=== Media ===\n{{Main|Media of Montenegro}}\nThe media of Montenegro refers to mass media outlets based in Montenegro. Television, magazines, and newspapers are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on advertising, [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. The [[Constitution of Montenegro]] guarantees freedom of speech.\nAs a [[country in transition]], Montenegro's media system is under transformation.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Montenegrin cuisine}}\n[[File:Foods from Montenegro.jpg|thumb|Foods from Montenegro]]\nMontenegrin cuisine is a result of Montenegro's long history. It is a variation of Mediterranean and Oriental. The most influence is from Italy, [[Turkey]], [[Byzantine Empire]]/[[Greece]], and Hungary. Montenegrin cuisine also varies geographically; the cuisine in the coastal area differs from the one in the northern highland region. The coastal area is traditionally a representative of [[Mediterranean cuisine]], with seafood being a common dish, while the northern represents more the Oriental.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Montenegro}}\n[[File:Nikola Vucevic Dec 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107]], a professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Orlando Magic]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] ([[NBA]]).]]\n\nThe '''Sports in Montenegro''' revolves mostly around team sports, such as [[Association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[water polo]], [[volleyball]], and [[Team handball|handball]].

[[Montenegrin national football team]], founded at 2006, played in playoffs for [[UEFA Euro 2012]], which is the biggest success in the history of national team.\n\n[[Water polo]] is often considered the national sport. Montenegro's [[Montenegro national water polo team|national team]] is one of the top ranked teams in the world, winning the gold medal at the [[2008 Men's European Water Polo Championship]] in [[M\u00e1laga]], Spain, and winning the gold medal at the [[2009 FINA Men's Water Polo World League]], which was held in the Montenegrin capital, [[Podgorica]].

Chesterton's 1904 political satire ''The Napoleon of Notting Hill'', which mocks the art of prophecy, opens in 1984. The year is also a significant date in ''The Iron Hill''.

Party flags are mentioned, but never described in the actual novel.]]\n\n''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is set in [[Oceania (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]], one of three inter-continental [[superstates]] that divided the world after a global war.\n\nSmith's memories and his reading of the proscribed book, ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'' by [[Emmanuel Goldstein]], reveal that after the [[Second World War]], the United Kingdom became involved in a war during the early 1950s in which [[nuclear weapon]]s destroyed hundreds of cities in Europe, western Russia and North America. [[Colchester]] was destroyed and London also suffered widespread aerial raids, leading Winston's family to take refuge in a [[London Underground]] station. Britain fell into civil war, with street fighting in London, before the English Socialist Party, abbreviated as [[Ingsoc]], emerged victorious and formed a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian government]] in Britain. The [[British Commonwealth]] and Latin America were absorbed by the United States, resulting in the superstate of Oceania. Ingsoc became the sole government party in this new nation.\n\nSimultaneously, the [[Soviet Union]] conquered [[continental Europe]] and established the second superstate of [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]], under a Neo-[[Bolshevik]] regime. The third superstate of [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]] emerged in the Far East after another decade of fighting, with a ruling ideology translated from Chinese as 'Death-Worship' or 'Obliteration of the Self'. The three superstates wage perpetual war for the remaining unconquered lands of the world in \"a rough quadrilateral with its corners at [[Tangier]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], and Hong Kong\" through constantly shifting alliances. Although each of the three states are said to have sufficient natural resources, the war continues to maintain ideological control over the people.\n\nWhile citizens in each state are trained to despise the ideologies of the other two as uncivilised and barbarous, Goldstein's book, ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'', explains that in fact the superstates' ideologies are practically identical and that the public's ignorance of this fact is imperative so that they might continue believing otherwise. The only references to the exterior world for the Oceanian citizenry (the Outer Party and the Proles) are Ministry of Truth maps and propaganda to ensure their belief in \"the war\".\n\nHowever, due to the fact that Winston barely remembers these events and due to the Party's manipulation of historical records, the continuity and accuracy of these events are unknown. Winston himself notes that the Party has claimed credit for inventing helicopters, aeroplanes, and trains, while Julia theorises that the perpetual bombing of London is merely a [[false-flag operation]] designed to convince the populace that a war is occurring. If the official account was accurate, Smith's strengthening memories and the story of his family's dissolution suggest that the atomic bombings occurred first, followed by civil war featuring \"confused street fighting in London itself\" and the societal postwar reorganisation, which the Party retrospectively calls \"the Revolution\".\n\nMost of the plot takes place in London, the \"chief city of [[Airstrip One]]\", the Oceanic province that \"had once been called England or Britain\".<ref>Part I, Ch. 1.</ref><ref>Part I, Ch. 3.</ref> Posters of the Party leader, [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], bearing the caption \"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU\", dominate the city (Winston states it can be found on nearly every house), while telescreens ([[transceiver|transceiving]] television set) monitor the private and public lives of the party members. Military parades, propaganda films, and [[public executions]] are said to be commonplace.\n\nThe class hierarchy of Oceania has three levels:\n* (I) the upper-class [[Inner Party]], the elite ruling minority, who make up 2% of the population.\n* (II) the professional-managerial class [[Outer Party]], the middle class, who make up 13% of the population.\n* (III) the lower-class [[Proles (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Proletariat]], who make up 85% of the population and represent the working class.\nAs the government, the Party controls the population with four ministries, each named after the opposite of their true function:\n* the [[Ministry of Peace]] deals with war and defence.\n* the [[Ministry of Plenty]] deals with economic affairs (starvation and rationing).\n* the [[Ministry of Love]] deals with law and order (torture and brainwashing).\n* the [[Ministry of Truth]] deals with news, entertainment, education and art (propaganda).\n\nThe protagonist [[Winston Smith]], a member of the Outer Party, works in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth as an editor, [[historical negationism|negating historical records]] to make the past conform to the ever-changing [[party line (politics)|party line]] and deleting references to ''[[unperson]]s'' (people who were not only killed by the state but denied existence even in history or memory).\n\nThe story of Winston Smith begins on 4 April 1984: \"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.\" Yet he is uncertain of the true date, given the regime's continual rewriting and manipulation of history.<ref>\"striking thirteen\" (1:00&nbsp;pm). In ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', the [[24-hour clock]] is modern, the [[12-hour clock]] is old-fashioned, Part I, Ch. 8.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:1984 fictious world map 2.png|thumb|left|upright=1.6|alt=Color-coded world map|World map, based on the novel]]\nIn the year 1984, civilisation has been damaged by war, civil conflict, and revolution. Airstrip One (formerly known as Great Britain) is a province of [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four|Oceania]], one of the three [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] super-states that rule the world. It is ruled by the \"Party\" under the ideology of \"[[Ingsoc]]\" (a shortening of \"English Socialism\") and the mysterious leader [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], who has an intense [[cult of personality]]. The Party stamps out anyone who does not fully conform to their regime using the [[Thought Police]] and constant surveillance through devices such as [[Telescreen]]s (two-way televisions).\n\nWinston Smith is a member of the middle-class [[Outer Party]], working at the [[Ministry of Truth]], where he [[historical negationism|rewrites historical records]] to conform to the state's ever-changing version of history. Those who fall out of favour with the Party become \"unpersons\", disappearing with all evidence of their existence removed. Winston revises past editions of ''[[The Times]]'', while the original documents are destroyed by fire in a \"[[memory hole]]\". He secretly opposes the Party's rule and dreams of rebellion, despite knowing that he is already a \"[[Thoughtcrime|thoughtcriminal]]\" and likely to be caught one day.\n\nWhile in a proletariat neighbourhood, he meets Mr. Charrington, the owner of an antiques shop, and buys a diary. He uses an alcove to hide it from the Telescreen in his room, and writes thoughts criticising the Party and Big Brother, and also writes that \"if there is hope, it lies in the proles\". To his dismay, when he visits a section of town where the proles live he discovers they have no political consciousness. An old man he talks to there has no significant memory of life before the Revolution. As he works in the Ministry of Truth, he observes [[Julia (1984)|Julia]], a young woman maintaining the novel-writing machines at the ministry, whom Winston suspects of being a spy against him, and develops an intense hatred of her. He vaguely suspects that his superior, an Inner Party official named [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]], is a member of an enigmatic underground [[resistance movement]] known as the Brotherhood, a group formed by Big Brother's reviled political rival [[Emmanuel Goldstein]]. Winston has a lunch conversation with a co-worker named Syme, who is writing a dictionary for a revised version of the English language called [[Newspeak]]. After Syme says freely that the true purpose of Newspeak is to reduce the capacity of human thought, Winston thinks to himself that Syme will disappear as he is \"too intelligent\" and therefore dangerous to the Party.\n\nOne day, Julia secretly hands Winston a note saying she loves him, and the two begin a torrid affair. This is an act of rebellion, as the Party insists that sex only be used for reproduction. Julia shares his loathing of the Party, but he later realizes that she is not interested in politics or in overthrowing the regime, thinking that it impossible. They at first rendezvous in the country, and later meet in a rented room above Mr. Charrington's shop. During his affair with Julia, Winston remembers the disappearance of his family during the civil war of the 1950s and his terse relationship with his wife Katharine, from whom he is separated (divorce is not permitted by the Party). He also notices the disappearance of Syme during one of his working days. Weeks later, Winston is approached by O'Brien, who invites Winston over to his flat, which is noted as being of far higher quality than Winston's. O'Brien introduces himself as a member of the Brotherhood and sends Winston a copy of ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'' by Emmanuel Goldstein. Meanwhile, during the nation's Hate Week, Oceania's enemy suddenly changes from [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]] to [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]], with no-one seemingly noticing the shift. Winston and Julia read parts of the book, which explains more about how the Party maintains power, the true meanings of its slogans and the concept of [[perpetual war]]. It argues that the Party can be overthrown if proles rise up against it. However, to Winston, it does not answer 'why' the Party maintains power.\n\nWinston and Julia are captured and imprisoned. Mr. Charrington is revealed to be an agent of the Thought Police. At the [[Ministry of Love]], Winston briefly interacts with colleagues who have been arrested for other offences. O'Brien arrives, revealing that he too is a Thought Police agent, part of a special [[sting operation]] to catch \"thoughtcriminals\". Over several months, Winston is starved and tortured and forced to \"cure\" himself of his \"insanity\" by changing his own perception to fit in line with the Party. O'Brien tells Winston that the Party \"is not interested in the good of others; it is interested solely in power.\" When O'Brien taunts Winston by asking him if there is any humiliation which he has not yet been made to suffer, Winston points out that the Party has not managed to make him betray Julia. O'Brien admits that is true. He says that once Winston is fully loyal, he will be released back into society for an unspecified period of time, and then he will be executed.\n\nStill imprisoned but now better fed and no longer mistreated, Winston grows stronger. Intellectually he has accepted that the party is invincible and \u2018objective truth\u2019 has no meaning. He has fully absorbed ''crimestop'', the instinctive conformity to state doctrine that precludes any oppositional thought. Emotionally, however, he at times clings to his old self. He fantasizes that moments before his execution his heretic side will emerge, which, as long as he is killed while unrepentant, will be his great victory over the party.\n\nWinston's hopes implode when, in an unconscious reverie, he calls out Julia's name. O\u2019Brien confronts him and Winston admits he hates Big Brother. O'Brien takes Winston to [[Room 101]] for the final stage of re-education. The room contains each prisoner's worst fear. In Winston's case it is rats. The fact that the Party knows this indicates the level of surveillance on the population is far more thorough than Winston previously believed. As a wire cage holding frenzied rats is fitted onto his face, Winston betrays Julia, begging his torturers to do it to Julia instead of him. Some time after being released Winston meets Julia in a park. She says she was also tortured, and both reveal betraying the other. They part ways. Later, Winston sits alone in a caf\u00e9 as Oceania celebrates a supposed victory over Eurasian armies in Africa and realises that, now, \"he loved Big Brother\".\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n[[File:Constellation of characters.png|thumb|A constellation of characters Winston interacts with in the book ''1984''.]]\n* [[Winston Smith]]&nbsp;\u2013 the protagonist who is a phlegmatic [[everyman]] and is curious of the past before the Revolution.\n*[[Julia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Julia]]&nbsp;\u2013 Winston's lover who is a covert \"[[Insurrectionist|rebel]] from the waist downwards\" who publicly espouses Party doctrine as a member of the fanatical Junior Anti-Sex League.\n* [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]]&nbsp;\u2013 a member of the Inner Party who poses as a member of The Brotherhood, the counter-revolutionary resistance, to deceive, trap, and capture Winston and Julia. O'Brien has a servant named Martin.\n\n===Secondary characters===\n* Aaronson, Jones, and Rutherford&nbsp;\u2013 former members of the Inner Party whom Winston vaguely remembers as among the original leaders of the Revolution, long before he had heard of Big Brother. They confessed to treasonable conspiracies with foreign powers and were then executed in the political purges of the 1960s. In between their confessions and executions, Winston saw them drinking in the Chestnut Tree Caf\u00e9\u2014with broken noses, suggesting that their confessions had been obtained by torture. Later, in the course of his editorial work, Winston sees newspaper evidence contradicting their confessions, but drops it into a [[memory hole]]. Eleven years later, he is confronted with the same photograph during his interrogation.\n* Ampleforth&nbsp;\u2013 Winston's one-time Records Department colleague who was imprisoned for leaving the word \"God\" in a Kipling poem as he could not find another rhyme for \"rod\";{{refn|This may be a reference to \"[[McAndrew's Hymn]]\", which includes the lines \"From coupler-flange to spindle-guide I see Thy Hand, O God\u2014 / Predestination in the stride o' yon connectin'-rod\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/george-orwell-weighs-scottish-independence/#! |title=George Orwell Weighs in on Scottish Independence |magazine=[[LA Review of Books]] |first=Nina |last=Martyris |date=18 September 2014 |accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref> }} Winston encounters him at the [[Ministry of Love|Miniluv]]. Ampleforth is a dreamer and intellectual who takes pleasure in his work, and respects poetry and language, traits which cause him disfavour with the Party.\n* Charrington&nbsp;\u2013 an officer of the [[Thought Police]] posing as a sympathetic antiques dealer amongst the Proles.\n* Katharine Smith&nbsp;\u2013 the emotionally indifferent wife whom Winston \"can't get rid of\". Despite disliking sexual intercourse, Katharine married Winston because it was their \"duty to the Party\". Although she was a \"goodthinkful\" ideologue, they separated because the couple could not conceive children. Divorce is not permitted, but couples who cannot have children may live separately. For much of the story Winston lives in vague hope that Katharine may die or could be \"got rid of\" so that he may marry Julia. He regrets not having killed her by pushing her over the edge of a quarry when he had the chance many years previously.\n* Tom Parsons&nbsp;\u2013 Winston's na\u00efve neighbour, and an ideal member of the Outer Party: an uneducated, suggestible man who is utterly loyal to the Party, and fully believes in its perfect image. He is socially active and participates in the Party activities for his social class. He is friendly towards Smith, and despite his political conformity punishes his bullying son for firing a [[slingshot|catapult]] at Winston. Later, as a prisoner, Winston sees Parsons is in the Ministry of Love, as his daughter had reported him to the Thought Police, saying she heard him speak against Big Brother in his sleep. Even this does not dampen his belief in the Party, and he states he could do \"good work\" in the hard labour camps.\n* Mrs. Parsons&nbsp;\u2013 Parsons's wife is a wan and hapless woman who is intimidated by her own children.\n** The Parsons children&nbsp;\u2013 members of the Party Youth League, representing the new generation of Oceanian citizens, without memory of life before Big Brother, and without family ties or emotional sentiment; the model society envisioned by the Inner Party.\n* Syme&nbsp;\u2013 Winston's colleague at the Ministry of Truth. He was a [[lexicography|lexicographer]] who helped develop the language and the dictionary of [[Newspeak]]. Although he is enthusiastic about his work and support for the Party, Winston notes that \"He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly.\" Winston predicts, correctly, that Syme will become an unperson.\n\n===Unseen characters===\nWhether these characters are real or fabrications of Party propaganda is something that neither Winston nor the reader is permitted to know:\n* [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]&nbsp;\u2013 the leader and figurehead of the Party that rules Oceania.\n* [[Emmanuel Goldstein]]&nbsp;\u2013 ostensibly a former leading figure in the Party who became the counter-revolutionary leader of the Brotherhood, and author of The Book, ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]''. Goldstein is the symbolic [[enemy of the state]]\u2014the national [[Archenemy|nemesis]] who ideologically unites the people of Oceania with the Party, especially during the [[Two Minutes Hate]] and other fearmongering.\n\n==World in novel==\n===Ingsoc===\n{{Main|Ingsoc}}\nIngsoc (English Socialism) is the predominant ideology and [[pseudophilosophy]] of Oceania, and [[Newspeak]] is the official language of official documents. Orwell depicts the Party's ideology as an [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] worldview that \"rejects and vilifies every principle for which the Socialist movement originally stood, and it does so in the name of Socialism.\"\n\n===Ministries of Oceania===\n{{Main|Ministries of Nineteen Eighty-Four}}\nIn London, the capital city of Airstrip One, Oceania's four government ministries are in pyramids (300 m high), the fa\u00e7ades of which display the Party's three slogans. As mentioned, the ministries' names are the opposite ([[doublethink]]) of their true functions: \"The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation.\" (Part II, Chapter IX&nbsp;\u2013 ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'')\n\n====Ministry of Peace====\nThe [[Ministry of Peace]] supports Oceania's perpetual war against either of the two other superstates:\n<blockquote>The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognised and not recognised by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work.</blockquote>\n\n====Ministry of Plenty====\nThe [[Ministry of Plenty]] rations and controls food, goods, and domestic production; every fiscal quarter, it publishes false claims of having raised the standard of living, when it has, in fact, reduced rations, availability and production. The Ministry of Truth substantiates the Ministry of Plenty's claims by [[historical revisionism (negationism)|revising]] historical records to report numbers supporting the current \"increased rations\".\n\n====Ministry of Truth====\nThe [[Ministry of Truth]] controls information: news, entertainment, education, and the arts. Winston Smith works in the Minitrue RecDep (Records Department), \"rectifying\" historical records to concord with Big Brother's current pronouncements so that everything the Party says is true.\n\n====Ministry of Love====\nThe [[Ministry of Love]] identifies, monitors, arrests and converts real and imagined dissidents. In Winston's experience, the dissident is beaten and tortured, and, when near-broken, he is sent to [[Room 101]] to face \"the worst thing in the world\"\u2014until love for Big Brother and the Party replaces dissension.\n\n===Doublethink===\n{{Main|Doublethink}}\n{{quotation|The keyword here is blackwhite. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink. Doublethink is basically the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.|Part II, Chapter IX&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]''|}}\n\n===Political geography===\n{{Main|Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four}}\n[[File:1984 fictitious world map v2 quad.svg|thumb|Fictitious map illustrating the political landscape of the novel]]\nThree perpetually warring [[totalitarian]] super-states control the world:<ref name=\"Part II, Ch. 9\">Part II, Ch. 9</ref>\n* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Oceania|Oceania]] (ideology: [[Ingsoc]], i.e. English Socialism), whose core territories are the [[Western Hemisphere]], the [[British Isles]], [[Australasia]], [[Polynesia]] and Southern Africa\n* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Eurasia|Eurasia]] (ideology: [[Neo-Bolshevism]]), whose core territories are [[Continental Europe]] and Russia, including [[Siberia]]\n* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Eastasia|Eastasia]] (ideology: [[Obliteration of the Self]] or [[Death Worship]]), whose core territories are China, Japan, [[Korea]] and [[Indochina]]\n\nThe perpetual war is fought for control of the \"disputed area\" lying \"between the frontiers of the super-states\", which forms \"a rough [[quadrilateral]] with its corners at [[Tangier]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and Hong Kong\",<ref name=\"Part II, Ch. 9\"/> and Northern Africa, the Middle East, India and Indonesia are where the superstates capture and use slave labour. Fighting also takes place between Eurasia and Eastasia in [[Manchuria]], Mongolia and Central Asia, and all three powers battle one another over various Atlantic and Pacific islands.\n\n===The Revolution===\n{{Main|The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism}}\nWinston Smith's memory and Emmanuel Goldstein's book communicate some of the history that precipitated the Revolution. Eurasia was formed when the [[Soviet Union]] conquered Continental Europe, creating a single state stretching from Portugal to the Bering Strait. [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]] does not include the British Isles because the United States annexed them along with the rest of the British Empire and Latin America, thus establishing Oceania and gaining control over a quarter of the planet. [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]], the last superstate established, emerged only after \"a decade of confused fighting\". It includes the Asian lands conquered by China and Japan. Although Eastasia is prevented from matching Eurasia's size, its larger populace compensates for that handicap.\n\nThe annexation of Britain occurred about the same time as the atomic war that provoked civil war, but who fought whom in the war is left unclear. Nuclear weapons fell on Britain; an atomic bombing of [[Colchester]] is referenced in the text. Exactly how Ingsoc and its rival systems (Neo-Bolshevism and Death Worship) gained power in their respective countries is also unclear.\n\nWhile the precise chronology cannot be traced, most of the global societal reorganisation occurred between 1945 and the early 1960s. Winston and Julia once meet in the ruins of a church that was destroyed in a nuclear attack \"thirty years\" earlier, which suggests 1954 as the year of the atomic war that destabilised society and allowed the Party to seize power. It is stated in the novel that the \"fourth quarter of 1983\" was \"also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year Plan\", which implies that the first quarter of the first three-year plan began in July 1958. By then, the Party was apparently in control of Oceania.\n\n===The War===\n{{See also|Perpetual war}}\nIn 1984, there is a perpetual war between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, the superstates that emerged from the global atomic war. ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'', by Emmanuel Goldstein, explains that each state is so strong it cannot be defeated, even with the combined forces of two superstates, despite changing alliances. To hide such contradictions, history is rewritten to explain that the (new) alliance always was so; the populaces are accustomed to doublethink and accept it. The war is not fought in Oceanian, Eurasian or Eastasian territory but in the Arctic wastes and in a disputed zone comprising the sea and land from Tangiers (Northern Africa) to Darwin (Australia). At the start, Oceania and Eastasia are allies fighting Eurasia in northern Africa and the [[Malabar Coast]].\n\nThat alliance ends and Oceania, allied with Eurasia, fights Eastasia, a change occurring on Hate Week, dedicated to creating patriotic fervour for the Party's perpetual war. The public are blind to the change; in mid-sentence, an orator changes the name of the enemy from \"Eurasia\" to \"Eastasia\" without pause. When the public are enraged at noticing that the wrong flags and posters are displayed, they tear them down; the Party later claims to have captured the whole of Africa.\n\nGoldstein's book explains that the purpose of the unwinnable, perpetual war is to consume human labour and commodities so that the economy of a superstate cannot support economic equality, with a high standard of life for every citizen. By using up most of the produced objects like boots and rations, the proles are kept poor and uneducated and will neither realise what the government is doing nor rebel. Goldstein also details an Oceanian strategy of attacking enemy cities with atomic rockets before invasion but dismisses it as unfeasible and contrary to the war's purpose; despite the atomic bombing of cities in the 1950s, the superstates stopped it for fear that would imbalance the powers. The military technology in the novel differs little from that of World War II, but strategic bomber aeroplanes are replaced with [[V-weapons|rocket bombs]], helicopters were heavily used as weapons of war (they did not figure in World War II in any form but prototypes) and surface combat units have been all but replaced by immense and unsinkable Floating Fortresses, island-like contraptions concentrating the firepower of a whole naval task force in a single, semi-mobile platform (in the novel, one is said to have been anchored between [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], suggesting a preference for sea lane interdiction and denial).\n\n===Living standards===\nThe society of Airstrip One and, according to \"The Book\", almost the whole world, lives in poverty: hunger, disease and filth are the norms. Ruined cities and towns are common: the consequence of the civil war, the atomic wars and the purportedly enemy (but possibly [[false flag]]) rockets. Social decay and wrecked buildings surround Winston; aside from the ministerial pyramids, little of London was rebuilt. Members of the Outer Party consume synthetic foodstuffs and poor-quality \"luxuries\" such as oily gin and loosely-packed cigarettes, distributed under the \"Victory\" brand. (That is a parody of the low-quality Indian-made \"Victory\" cigarettes, widely smoked in Britain and by British soldiers during World War II. They were smoked because it was easier to import them from India than it was to import American cigarettes from across the Atlantic because of the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].)\n\nWinston describes something as simple as the repair of a broken pane of glass as requiring committee approval that can take several years and so most of those living in one of the blocks usually do the repairs themselves (Winston himself is called in by Mrs. Parsons to repair her blocked sink). All Outer Party residences include [[telescreens]] that serve both as outlets for propaganda and to monitor the Party members; they can be turned down, but they cannot be turned off.\n\nIn contrast to their subordinates, the Inner Party upper class of Oceanian society reside in clean and comfortable flats in their own quarter of the city, with pantries well-stocked with foodstuffs such as wine, coffee and sugar, all denied to the general populace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/198423.asp|title=Barron's Booknotes-1984 by George Orwell|last=Reed|first=Kit|year=1985|publisher=[[Barron's Educational Series]]|accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref> Winston is astonished that the [[elevator|lifts]] in O'Brien's building work, the [[telescreens]] can be switched off and O'Brien has an Asian manservant, Martin. All members of the Inner Party are attended to by slaves captured in the disputed zone, and \"The Book\" suggests that many have their own motorcars or even helicopters. Nonetheless, \"The Book\" makes clear that even the conditions enjoyed by the Inner Party are only \"relatively\" comfortable, and standards would be regarded as austere by those of the prerevolutionary \u00e9lite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/16.html|title=1984}}Part 2, Chapter 9</ref>\n\nThe proles live in poverty and are kept sedated with alcohol, pornography and a national lottery whose winnings are never actually paid out; that is obscured by propaganda and the lack of communication within Oceania. At the same time, the proles are freer and less intimidated than the middle-class Outer Party: they are subject to certain levels of monitoring but are not expected to be particularly patriotic. They lack telescreens in their own homes and often jeer at the telescreens that they see. \"The Book\" indicates that is because the middle class, not the lower class, traditionally starts revolutions. The model demands tight control of the middle class, with ambitious Outer-Party members neutralised via promotion to the Inner Party or \"reintegration\" by the Ministry of Love, and proles can be allowed intellectual freedom because they are deemed to lack intellect. Winston nonetheless believes that \"the future belonged to the proles\".<ref>Lines 29\u201335, p. 229, Chapter X, Part II of the Penguin paperback edition of 1984: \"The proles were immortal, you could not doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. In the end their awakening would come. And until that happened, though it might be a thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds, passing on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not share and could not kill\".</ref>\n\nThe standard of living of the populace is low overall. Consumer goods are scarce, and all those available through official channels are of low quality; for instance, despite the Party regularly reporting increased boot production, more than half of the Oceanian populace goes barefoot. The Party claims that poverty is a necessary sacrifice for the war effort, and \"The Book\" confirms that to be partially correct since the purpose of perpetual war consumes surplus industrial production. Outer Party members and proles occasionally gain access to better items in the market, which deals in goods that were pilfered from the residences of the Inner Party.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Themes==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Nationalism===\n''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' expands upon the subjects summarised in Orwell's essay \"[[Notes on Nationalism]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/nationalism.html|title=George Orwell: \"Notes on Nationalism\"|date=May 1945|publisher=Resort.com|accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref> about the lack of vocabulary needed to explain the unrecognised phenomena behind certain political forces.

The crowd instantly transfers its hatred to the new enemy. Transferred nationalism swiftly redirects emotions from one power unit to another (for example, Communism, [[Pacifism]], Colour Feeling and Class Feeling). It happens during Hate Week, a Party rally against the original enemy. The crowd goes wild and destroys the posters that are now against their new friend, and many say that they must be the act of an agent of their new enemy and former friend. Many of the crowd must have put up the posters before the rally but think that the state of affairs had always been the case.\n\nO'Brien concludes: \"The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.\"\n\n===Futurology===\nIn the book, Inner Party member O'Brien describes the Party's vision of the future: {{Quote|There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life.

One small example of the endless censorship is Winston being charged with the task of eliminating a reference to an unperson in a newspaper article. He proceeds to write an article about '''Comrade Ogilvy''', a made-up party member who displayed great heroism by leaping into the sea from a helicopter so that the dispatches he was carrying would not fall into enemy hands.<ref>{{Cite book|title=1984|last=Orwell|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=part 1, chapter 4}}</ref>\n\n===Surveillance===\nThe inhabitants of [[Oceania (Ninteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]], particularly the Outer Party members, have no real privacy. Many of them live in apartments equipped with two-way [[telescreen]]s so that they may be watched or listened to at any time. Similar telescreens are found at workstations and in public places, along with hidden microphones. Written correspondence is routinely opened and read by the government before it is delivered. The Thought Police employ undercover agents, who pose as normal citizens and report any person with subversive tendencies. Children are encouraged to report suspicious persons to the government, and some denounce their parents. Citizens are controlled, and the smallest sign of rebellion, even something so small as a facial expression, can result in immediate arrest and imprisonment. Thus, citizens, particularly party members, are compelled to obedience.\n\n==Newspeak appendix==\n{{Main|Newspeak|List of Newspeak words}}\n\"The Principles of Newspeak\" is an academic essay appended to the novel. It describes the development of Newspeak, the Party's minimalist artificial language meant to ideologically align thought and action with the principles of Ingsoc by making \"all other modes of thought\" (i.e. any thoughts, concepts, or sayings that go against Ingsoc) impossible. The idea that the structure of language can be used to influence thought is known as [[linguistic relativity]].\n\nWhether or not the Newspeak appendix implies a hopeful end to ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' remains a critical debate, as it is in Standard English and refers to Newspeak, Ingsoc, the Party etc., in the [[past tense]]: \"Relative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised\" p.&nbsp;422).

Some time at an unspecified date after the first American publication of the book, producer [[Sidney Sheldon]] wrote to Orwell interested in adapting the novel to the Broadway stage. Orwell sold the American stage rights to Sheldon, explaining that his basic goal with ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' was imagining the consequences of Stalinist government ruling British society:\n<blockquote>[''Nineteen Eighty-Four''] was based chiefly on communism, because that is the dominant form of totalitarianism, but I was trying chiefly to imagine what communism would be like if it were firmly rooted in the English speaking countries, and was no longer a mere extension of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Russian Foreign Office]].<ref>Sheldon, Sidney (2006) ''The Other Side of Me'', Grand Central Publishing, p. 213</ref></blockquote> According to Orwell biographer [[D. J. Taylor]], the author's ''[[A Clergyman's Daughter]]'' (1935) has \"essentially the same plot of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' ... It's about somebody who is spied upon, and eavesdropped upon, and oppressed by vast exterior forces they can do nothing about. It makes an attempt at rebellion and then has to compromise\".<ref name=\"fivebookstaylor\">{{Cite interview |last=Taylor |first=D.

A large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete\"; ch 9) is evocative of the Soviet Union's changing relations with Nazi Germany. The two nations were open and frequently vehement critics of each other until the signing of the 1939 [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|Treaty of Non-Aggression]]. Thereafter, and continuing until the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, no criticism of Germany was allowed in the Soviet press, and all references to prior party lines stopped\u2014including in the majority of non-Russian communist parties who tended to follow the Russian line.

He wrote 'Whether in actual fact the policy of the boot-on-the-face can go on indefinitely seems doubtful.

[His wife] Eileen wrote a poem for her old school's centenary called \"End of the Century: 1984.\" G. K. Chesterton's 1904 political satire ''The Napoleon of Notting Hill'', which mocks the art of prophecy, opens in 1984. The year is also a significant date in ''The Iron Hill''. But all of these connections are exposed as no more than coincidences by the early drafts of the novel Orwell was still calling ''The Last Man in Europe''.

Party flags are mentioned, but never described in the actual novel.]]\n\n''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is set in [[Oceania (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]], one of three inter-continental [[superstates]] that divided the world after a global war.\n\nSmith's memories and his reading of the proscribed book, ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'' by [[Emmanuel Goldstein]], reveal that after the [[Second World War]], the United Kingdom became involved in a war during the early 1950s in which [[nuclear weapon]]s destroyed hundreds of cities in Europe, western Russia and North America. [[Colchester]] was destroyed and London also suffered widespread aerial raids, leading Winston's family to take refuge in a [[London Underground]] station. Britain fell into civil war, with street fighting in London, before the English Socialist Party, abbreviated as [[Ingsoc]], emerged victorious and formed a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian government]] in Britain. The [[British Commonwealth]] and Latin America were absorbed by the United States, resulting in the superstate of Oceania. Ingsoc became the sole government party in this new nation.\n\nSimultaneously, the [[Soviet Union]] conquered [[continental Europe]] and established the second superstate of [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]], under a Neo-[[Bolshevik]] regime. The third superstate of [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]] emerged in the Far East after another decade of fighting, with a ruling ideology translated from Chinese as 'Death-Worship' or 'Obliteration of the Self'. The three superstates wage perpetual war for the remaining unconquered lands of the world in \"a rough quadrilateral with its corners at [[Tangier]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], and Hong Kong\" through constantly shifting alliances. Although each of the three states are said to have sufficient natural resources, the war continues to maintain ideological control over the people.\n\nWhile citizens in each state are trained to despise the ideologies of the other two as uncivilised and barbarous, Goldstein's book, ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'', explains that in fact the superstates' ideologies are practically identical and that the public's ignorance of this fact is imperative so that they might continue believing otherwise. The only references to the exterior world for the Oceanian citizenry (the Outer Party and the Proles) are Ministry of Truth maps and propaganda to ensure their belief in \"the war\".\n\nHowever, due to the fact that Winston barely remembers these events and due to the Party's manipulation of historical records, the continuity and accuracy of these events are unknown. Winston himself notes that the Party has claimed credit for inventing helicopters, aeroplanes, and trains, while Julia theorises that the perpetual bombing of London is merely a [[false-flag operation]] designed to convince the populace that a war is occurring. If the official account was accurate, Smith's strengthening memories and the story of his family's dissolution suggest that the atomic bombings occurred first, followed by civil war featuring \"confused street fighting in London itself\" and the societal postwar reorganisation, which the Party retrospectively calls \"the Revolution\".\n\nMost of the plot takes place in London, the \"chief city of [[Airstrip One]]\", the Oceanic province that \"had once been called England or Britain\".<ref>Part I, Ch. 1.</ref><ref>Part I, Ch. 3.</ref> Posters of the Party leader, [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], bearing the caption \"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU\", dominate the city (Winston states it can be found on nearly every house), while telescreens ([[transceiver|transceiving]] television set) monitor the private and public lives of the party members. Military parades, propaganda films, and [[public executions]] are said to be commonplace.\n\nThe class hierarchy of Oceania has three levels:\n* (I) the upper-class [[Inner Party]], the elite ruling minority, who make up 2% of the population.\n* (II) the professional-managerial class [[Outer Party]], the middle class, who make up 13% of the population.\n* (III) the lower-class [[Proles (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Proletariat]], who make up 85% of the population and represent the working class.\nAs the government, the Party controls the population with four ministries, each named after the opposite of their true function:\n* the [[Ministry of Peace]] deals with war and defence.\n* the [[Ministry of Plenty]] deals with economic affairs (starvation and rationing).\n* the [[Ministry of Love]] deals with law and order (torture and brainwashing).\n* the [[Ministry of Truth]] deals with news, entertainment, education and art (propaganda).\n\nThe protagonist [[Winston Smith]], a member of the Outer Party, works in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth as an editor, [[historical negationism|negating historical records]] to make the past conform to the ever-changing [[party line (politics)|party line]] and deleting references to ''[[unperson]]s'' (people who have not only killed by the state but denied existence even in history or memory).\n\nThe story of Winston Smith begins on 4 April 1984: \"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.\" Yet he is uncertain of the true date, given the regime's continual rewriting and manipulation of history.<ref>\"striking thirteen\" (1:00&nbsp;pm). In ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', the [[24-hour clock]] is modern, the [[12-hour clock]] is old-fashioned, Part I, Ch. 8.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:1984 fictious world map 2.png|thumb|left|upright=1.6|alt=Color-coded world map|World map, based on the novel]]\nIn the year 1984, civilisation has been damaged by war, civil conflict, and revolution. Airstrip One (formerly known as Great Britain) is a province of [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four|Oceania]], one of the three [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] super-states that rule the world. It is ruled by the \"Party\" under the ideology of \"[[Ingsoc]]\" (a shortening of \"English Socialism\") and the mysterious leader [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], who has an intense [[cult of personality]]. The Party stamps out anyone who does not fully conform to their regime using the [[Thought Police]] and constant surveillance through devices such as [[Telescreen]]s (two-way televisions).\n\nWinston Smith is a member of the middle-class [[Outer Party]], working at the [[Ministry of Truth]], where he [[historical negationism|rewrites historical records]] to conform to the state's ever-changing version of history. Those who fall out of favour with the Party become \"unpersons\", disappearing with all evidence of their existence removed. Winston revises past editions of ''[[The Times]]'', while the original documents are destroyed by fire in a \"[[memory hole]]\". He secretly opposes the Party's rule and dreams of rebellion, despite knowing that he is already a \"[[Thoughtcrime|thoughtcriminal]]\" and likely to be caught one day.\n\nWhile in a proletariat neighbourhood, he meets Mr. Charrington, the owner of an antiques shop, and buys a diary. He uses an alcove to hide it from the Telescreen in his room, and writes thoughts criticising the Party and Big Brother, and also writes that \"if there is hope, it lies in the proles\". To his dismay, when he visits a section of town where the proles live he discovers they have no political consciousness. An old man he talks to there has no significant memory of life before the Revolution. As he works in the Ministry of Truth, he observes [[Julia (1984)|Julia]], a young woman maintaining the novel-writing machines at the ministry, whom Winston suspects of being a spy against him, and develops an intense hatred of her. He vaguely suspects that his superior, an Inner Party official named [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]], is a member of an enigmatic underground [[resistance movement]] known as the Brotherhood, a group formed by Big Brother's reviled political rival [[Emmanuel Goldstein]]. Winston has a lunch conversation with a co-worker named Syme, who is writing a dictionary for a revised version of the English language called [[Newspeak]]. After Syme says freely that the true purpose of Newspeak is to reduce the capacity of human thought, Winston thinks to himself that Syme will disappear as he is \"too intelligent\" and therefore dangerous to the Party.\n\nOne day, Julia secretly hands Winston a note saying she loves him, and the two begin a torrid affair. This is an act of rebellion, as the Party insists that sex only be used for reproduction. Julia shares his loathing of the Party, but he later realizes that she is not interested in politics or in overthrowing the regime, thinking that it impossible. They at first rendezvous in the country, and later meet in a rented room above Mr. Charrington's shop. During his affair with Julia, Winston remembers the disappearance of his family during the civil war of the 1950s and his terse relationship with his wife Katharine, from whom he is separated (divorce is not permitted by the Party). He also notices the disappearance of Syme during one of his working days. Weeks later, Winston is approached by O'Brien, who invites Winston over to his flat, which is noted as being of far higher quality than Winston's. O'Brien introduces himself as a member of the Brotherhood and sends Winston a copy of ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'' by Emmanuel Goldstein. Meanwhile, during the nation's Hate Week, Oceania's enemy suddenly changes from [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]] to [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]], with no-one seemingly noticing the shift. Winston and Julia read parts of the book, which explains more about how the Party maintains power, the true meanings of its slogans and the concept of [[perpetual war]]. It argues that the Party can be overthrown if proles rise up against it. However, to Winston, it does not answer 'why' the Party maintains power.\n\nWinston and Julia are captured and imprisoned. Mr. Charrington is revealed to be an agent of the Thought Police. At the [[Ministry of Love]], Winston briefly interacts with colleagues who have been arrested for other offences. O'Brien arrives, revealing that he too is a Thought Police agent, part of a special [[sting operation]] to catch \"thoughtcriminals\". Over several months, Winston is starved and tortured and forced to \"cure\" himself of his \"insanity\" by changing his own perception to fit in line with the Party. O'Brien tells Winston that the Party \"is not interested in the good of others; it is interested solely in power.\" When O'Brien taunts Winston by asking him if there is any humiliation which he has not yet been made to suffer, Winston points out that the Party has not managed to make him betray Julia. O'Brien admits that is true. He says that once Winston is fully loyal, he will be released back into society for an unspecified period of time, and then he will be executed.\n\nStill imprisoned but now better fed and no longer mistreated, Winston grows stronger. Intellectually he has accepted that the party is invincible and \u2018objective truth\u2019 has no meaning. He has fully absorbed ''crimestop'', the instinctive conformity to state doctrine that precludes any oppositional thought. Emotionally, however, he at times clings to his old self. He fantasizes that moments before his execution his heretic side will emerge, which, as long as he is killed while unrepentant, will be his great victory over the party.\n\nWinston's hopes implode when, in an unconscious reverie, he calls out Julia's name. O\u2019Brien confronts him and Winston admits he hates Big Brother. O'Brien takes Winston to [[Room 101]] for the final stage of re-education. The room contains each prisoner's worst fear. In Winston's case it is rats. The fact that the Party knows this indicates the level of surveillance on the population is far more thorough than Winston previously believed. As a wire cage holding frenzied rats is fitted onto his face, Winston betrays Julia, begging his torturers to do it to Julia instead of him. Some time after being released Winston meets Julia in a park. She says she was also tortured, and both reveal betraying the other. They part ways. Later, Winston sits alone in a caf\u00e9 as Oceania celebrates a supposed victory over Eurasian armies in Africa and realises that, now, \"he loved Big Brother\".\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n[[File:Constellation of characters.png|thumb|A constellation of characters Winston interacts with in the book ''1984''.]]\n* [[Winston Smith]]&nbsp;\u2013 the protagonist who is a phlegmatic [[everyman]] and is curious of the past before the Revolution.\n*[[Julia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Julia]]&nbsp;\u2013 Winston's lover who is a covert \"[[Insurrectionist|rebel]] from the waist downwards\" who publicly espouses Party doctrine as a member of the fanatical Junior Anti-Sex League.\n* [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]]&nbsp;\u2013 a member of the Inner Party who poses as a member of The Brotherhood, the counter-revolutionary resistance, to deceive, trap, and capture Winston and Julia. O'Brien has a servant named Martin.\n\n===Secondary characters===\n* Aaronson, Jones, and Rutherford&nbsp;\u2013 former members of the Inner Party whom Winston vaguely remembers as among the original leaders of the Revolution, long before he had heard of Big Brother. They confessed to treasonable conspiracies with foreign powers and were then executed in the political purges of the 1960s. In between their confessions and executions, Winston saw them drinking in the Chestnut Tree Caf\u00e9\u2014with broken noses, suggesting that their confessions had been obtained by torture. Later, in the course of his editorial work, Winston sees newspaper evidence contradicting their confessions, but drops it into a [[memory hole]]. Eleven years later, he is confronted with the same photograph during his interrogation.\n* Ampleforth&nbsp;\u2013 Winston's one-time Records Department colleague who was imprisoned for leaving the word \"God\" in a Kipling poem as he could not find another rhyme for \"rod\";{{refn|This may be a reference to \"[[McAndrew's Hymn]]\", which includes the lines \"From coupler-flange to spindle-guide I see Thy Hand, O God\u2014 / Predestination in the stride o' yon connectin'-rod\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/george-orwell-weighs-scottish-independence/#! |title=George Orwell Weighs in on Scottish Independence |magazine=[[LA Review of Books]] |first=Nina |last=Martyris |date=18 September 2014 |accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref> }} Winston encounters him at the [[Ministry of Love|Miniluv]]. Ampleforth is a dreamer and intellectual who takes pleasure in his work, and respects poetry and language, traits which cause him disfavour with the Party.\n* Charrington&nbsp;\u2013 an officer of the [[Thought Police]] posing as a sympathetic antiques dealer amongst the Proles.\n* Katharine Smith&nbsp;\u2013 the emotionally indifferent wife whom Winston \"can't get rid of\". Despite disliking sexual intercourse, Katharine married Winston because it was their \"duty to the Party\". Although she was a \"goodthinkful\" ideologue, they separated because the couple could not conceive children. Divorce is not permitted, but couples who cannot have children may live separately. For much of the story Winston lives in vague hope that Katharine may die or could be \"got rid of\" so that he may marry Julia. He regrets not having killed her by pushing her over the edge of a quarry when he had the chance many years previously.\n* Tom Parsons&nbsp;\u2013 Winston's na\u00efve neighbour, and an ideal member of the Outer Party: an uneducated, suggestible man who is utterly loyal to the Party, and fully believes in its perfect image. He is socially active and participates in the Party activities for his social class. He is friendly towards Smith, and despite his political conformity punishes his bullying son for firing a [[slingshot|catapult]] at Winston. Later, as a prisoner, Winston sees Parsons is in the Ministry of Love, as his daughter had reported him to the Thought Police, saying she heard him speak against Big Brother in his sleep. Even this does not dampen his belief in the Party, and he states he could do \"good work\" in the hard labour camps.\n* Mrs. Parsons&nbsp;\u2013 Parsons's wife is a wan and hapless woman who is intimidated by her own children.\n** The Parsons children&nbsp;\u2013 members of the Party Youth League, representing the new generation of Oceanian citizens, without memory of life before Big Brother, and without family ties or emotional sentiment; the model society envisioned by the Inner Party.\n* Syme&nbsp;\u2013 Winston's colleague at the Ministry of Truth. He was a [[lexicography|lexicographer]] who helped develop the language and the dictionary of [[Newspeak]]. Although he is enthusiastic about his work and support for the Party, Winston notes that \"He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly.\" Winston predicts, correctly, that Syme will become an unperson.\n\n===Unseen characters===\nWhether these characters are real or fabrications of Party propaganda is something that neither Winston nor the reader is permitted to know:\n* [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]&nbsp;\u2013 the leader and figurehead of the Party that rules Oceania.\n* [[Emmanuel Goldstein]]&nbsp;\u2013 ostensibly a former leading figure in the Party who became the counter-revolutionary leader of the Brotherhood, and author of The Book, ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]''. Goldstein is the symbolic [[enemy of the state]]\u2014the national [[Archenemy|nemesis]] who ideologically unites the people of Oceania with the Party, especially during the [[Two Minutes Hate]] and other fearmongering.\n\n==World in novel==\n===Ingsoc===\n{{Main|Ingsoc}}\nIngsoc (English Socialism) is the predominant ideology and [[pseudophilosophy]] of Oceania, and [[Newspeak]] is the official language of official documents. Orwell depicts the Party's ideology as an [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] worldview that \"rejects and vilifies every principle for which the Socialist movement originally stood, and it does so in the name of Socialism.\"\n\n===Ministries of Oceania===\n{{Main|Ministries of Nineteen Eighty-Four}}\nIn London, the capital city of Airstrip One, Oceania's four government ministries are in pyramids (300 m high), the fa\u00e7ades of which display the Party's three slogans. As mentioned, the ministries' names are the opposite ([[doublethink]]) of their true functions: \"The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation.\" (Part II, Chapter IX&nbsp;\u2013 ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'')\n\n====Ministry of Peace====\nThe [[Ministry of Peace]] supports Oceania's perpetual war against either of the two other superstates:\n<blockquote>The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognised and not recognised by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work.</blockquote>\n\n====Ministry of Plenty====\nThe [[Ministry of Plenty]] rations and controls food, goods, and domestic production; every fiscal quarter, it publishes false claims of having raised the standard of living, when it has, in fact, reduced rations, availability and production. The Ministry of Truth substantiates the Ministry of Plenty's claims by [[historical revisionism (negationism)|revising]] historical records to report numbers supporting the current \"increased rations\".\n\n====Ministry of Truth====\nThe [[Ministry of Truth]] controls information: news, entertainment, education, and the arts. Winston Smith works in the Minitrue RecDep (Records Department), \"rectifying\" historical records to concord with Big Brother's current pronouncements so that everything the Party says is true.\n\n====Ministry of Love====\nThe [[Ministry of Love]] identifies, monitors, arrests and converts real and imagined dissidents. In Winston's experience, the dissident is beaten and tortured, and, when near-broken, he is sent to [[Room 101]] to face \"the worst thing in the world\"\u2014until love for Big Brother and the Party replaces dissension.\n\n===Doublethink===\n{{Main|Doublethink}}\n{{quotation|The keyword here is blackwhite. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink. Doublethink is basically the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.|Part II, Chapter IX&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]''|}}\n\n===Political geography===\n{{Main|Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four}}\n[[File:1984 fictitious world map v2 quad.svg|thumb|Fictitious map illustrating the political landscape of the novel]]\nThree perpetually warring [[totalitarian]] super-states control the world:<ref name=\"Part II, Ch. 9\">Part II, Ch. 9</ref>\n* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Oceania|Oceania]] (ideology: [[Ingsoc]], i.e. English Socialism), whose core territories are the [[Western Hemisphere]], the [[British Isles]], [[Australasia]], [[Polynesia]] and Southern Africa\n* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Eurasia|Eurasia]] (ideology: [[Neo-Bolshevism]]), whose core territories are [[Continental Europe]] and Russia, including [[Siberia]]\n* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Eastasia|Eastasia]] (ideology: [[Obliteration of the Self]] or [[Death Worship]]), whose core territories are China, Japan, [[Korea]] and [[Indochina]]\n\nThe perpetual war is fought for control of the \"disputed area\" lying \"between the frontiers of the super-states\", which forms \"a rough [[quadrilateral]] with its corners at [[Tangier]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and Hong Kong\",<ref name=\"Part II, Ch. 9\"/> and Northern Africa, the Middle East, India and Indonesia are where the superstates capture and use slave labour. Fighting also takes place between Eurasia and Eastasia in [[Manchuria]], Mongolia and Central Asia, and all three powers battle one another over various Atlantic and Pacific islands.\n\n===The Revolution===\n{{Main|The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism}}\nWinston Smith's memory and Emmanuel Goldstein's book communicate some of the history that precipitated the Revolution. Eurasia was formed when the [[Soviet Union]] conquered Continental Europe, creating a single state stretching from Portugal to the Bering Strait. [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]] does not include the British Isles because the United States annexed them along with the rest of the British Empire and Latin America, thus establishing Oceania and gaining control over a quarter of the planet. [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]], the last superstate established, emerged only after \"a decade of confused fighting\". It includes the Asian lands conquered by China and Japan. Although Eastasia is prevented from matching Eurasia's size, its larger populace compensates for that handicap.\n\nThe annexation of Britain occurred about the same time as the atomic war that provoked civil war, but who fought whom in the war is left unclear. Nuclear weapons fell on Britain; an atomic bombing of [[Colchester]] is referenced in the text. Exactly how Ingsoc and its rival systems (Neo-Bolshevism and Death Worship) gained power in their respective countries is also unclear.\n\nWhile the precise chronology cannot be traced, most of the global societal reorganisation occurred between 1945 and the early 1960s. Winston and Julia once meet in the ruins of a church that was destroyed in a nuclear attack \"thirty years\" earlier, which suggests 1954 as the year of the atomic war that destabilised society and allowed the Party to seize power. It is stated in the novel that the \"fourth quarter of 1983\" was \"also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year Plan\", which implies that the first quarter of the first three-year plan began in July 1958. By then, the Party was apparently in control of Oceania.\n\n===The War===\n{{See also|Perpetual war}}\nIn 1984, there is a perpetual war between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, the superstates that emerged from the global atomic war. ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'', by Emmanuel Goldstein, explains that each state is so strong it cannot be defeated, even with the combined forces of two superstates, despite changing alliances. To hide such contradictions, history is rewritten to explain that the (new) alliance always was so; the populaces are accustomed to doublethink and accept it. The war is not fought in Oceanian, Eurasian or Eastasian territory but in the Arctic wastes and in a disputed zone comprising the sea and land from Tangiers (Northern Africa) to Darwin (Australia). At the start, Oceania and Eastasia are allies fighting Eurasia in northern Africa and the [[Malabar Coast]].\n\nThat alliance ends and Oceania, allied with Eurasia, fights Eastasia, a change occurring on Hate Week, dedicated to creating patriotic fervour for the Party's perpetual war. The public are blind to the change; in mid-sentence, an orator changes the name of the enemy from \"Eurasia\" to \"Eastasia\" without pause. When the public are enraged at noticing that the wrong flags and posters are displayed, they tear them down; the Party later claims to have captured the whole of Africa.\n\nGoldstein's book explains that the purpose of the unwinnable, perpetual war is to consume human labour and commodities so that the economy of a superstate cannot support economic equality, with a high standard of life for every citizen. By using up most of the produced objects like boots and rations, the proles are kept poor and uneducated and will neither realise what the government is doing nor rebel. Goldstein also details an Oceanian strategy of attacking enemy cities with atomic rockets before invasion but dismisses it as unfeasible and contrary to the war's purpose; despite the atomic bombing of cities in the 1950s, the superstates stopped it for fear that would imbalance the powers. The military technology in the novel differs little from that of World War II, but strategic bomber aeroplanes are replaced with [[V-weapons|rocket bombs]], helicopters were heavily used as weapons of war (they did not figure in World War II in any form but prototypes) and surface combat units have been all but replaced by immense and unsinkable Floating Fortresses, island-like contraptions concentrating the firepower of a whole naval task force in a single, semi-mobile platform (in the novel, one is said to have been anchored between [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], suggesting a preference for sea lane interdiction and denial).\n\n===Living standards===\nThe society of Airstrip One and, according to \"The Book\", almost the whole world, lives in poverty: hunger, disease and filth are the norms. Ruined cities and towns are common: the consequence of the civil war, the atomic wars and the purportedly enemy (but possibly [[false flag]]) rockets. Social decay and wrecked buildings surround Winston; aside from the ministerial pyramids, little of London was rebuilt. Members of the Outer Party consume synthetic foodstuffs and poor-quality \"luxuries\" such as oily gin and loosely-packed cigarettes, distributed under the \"Victory\" brand. (That is a parody of the low-quality Indian-made \"Victory\" cigarettes, widely smoked in Britain and by British soldiers during World War II. They were smoked because it was easier to import them from India than it was to import American cigarettes from across the Atlantic because of the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].)\n\nWinston describes something as simple as the repair of a broken pane of glass as requiring committee approval that can take several years and so most of those living in one of the blocks usually do the repairs themselves (Winston himself is called in by Mrs. Parsons to repair her blocked sink). All Outer Party residences include [[telescreens]] that serve both as outlets for propaganda and to monitor the Party members; they can be turned down, but they cannot be turned off.\n\nIn contrast to their subordinates, the Inner Party upper class of Oceanian society reside in clean and comfortable flats in their own quarter of the city, with pantries well-stocked with foodstuffs such as wine, coffee and sugar, all denied to the general populace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/198423.asp|title=Barron's Booknotes-1984 by George Orwell|last=Reed|first=Kit|year=1985|publisher=[[Barron's Educational Series]]|accessdate=2 July 2009}}</ref> Winston is astonished that the [[elevator|lifts]] in O'Brien's building work, the [[telescreens]] can be switched off and O'Brien has an Asian manservant, Martin. All members of the Inner Party are attended to by slaves captured in the disputed zone, and \"The Book\" suggests that many have their own motorcars or even helicopters. Nonetheless, \"The Book\" makes clear that even the conditions enjoyed by the Inner Party are only \"relatively\" comfortable, and standards would be regarded as austere by those of the prerevolutionary \u00e9lite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/16.html|title=1984}}Part 2, Chapter 9</ref>\n\nThe proles live in poverty and are kept sedated with alcohol, pornography and a national lottery whose winnings are never actually paid out; that is obscured by propaganda and the lack of communication within Oceania. At the same time, the proles are freer and less intimidated than the middle-class Outer Party: they are subject to certain levels of monitoring but are not expected to be particularly patriotic. They lack telescreens in their own homes and often jeer at the telescreens that they see. \"The Book\" indicates that is because the middle class, not the lower class, traditionally starts revolutions. The model demands tight control of the middle class, with ambitious Outer-Party members neutralised via promotion to the Inner Party or \"reintegration\" by the Ministry of Love, and proles can be allowed intellectual freedom because they are deemed to lack intellect. Winston nonetheless believes that \"the future belonged to the proles\".<ref>Lines 29\u201335, p. 229, Chapter X, Part II of the Penguin paperback edition of 1984: \"The proles were immortal, you could not doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. In the end their awakening would come. And until that happened, though it might be a thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds, passing on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not share and could not kill\".</ref>\n\nThe standard of living of the populace is low overall. Consumer goods are scarce, and all those available through official channels are of low quality; for instance, despite the Party regularly reporting increased boot production, more than half of the Oceanian populace goes barefoot. The Party claims that poverty is a necessary sacrifice for the war effort, and \"The Book\" confirms that to be partially correct since the purpose of perpetual war consumes surplus industrial production. Outer Party members and proles occasionally gain access to better items in the market, which deals in goods that were pilfered from the residences of the Inner Party.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Themes==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Nationalism===\n''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' expands upon the subjects summarised in Orwell's essay \"[[Notes on Nationalism]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/nationalism.html|title=George Orwell: \"Notes on Nationalism\"|date=May 1945|publisher=Resort.com|accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref> about the lack of vocabulary needed to explain the unrecognised phenomena behind certain political forces.

The crowd instantly transfers its hatred to the new enemy. Transferred nationalism swiftly redirects emotions from one power unit to another (for example, Communism, [[Pacifism]], Colour Feeling and Class Feeling). It happens during Hate Week, a Party rally against the original enemy. The crowd goes wild and destroys the posters that are now against their new friend, and many say that they must be the act of an agent of their new enemy and former friend. Many of the crowd must have put up the posters before the rally but think that the state of affairs had always been the case.\n\nO'Brien concludes: \"The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.\"\n\n===Futurology===\nIn the book, Inner Party member O'Brien describes the Party's vision of the future: {{Quote|There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life.

One small example of the endless censorship is Winston being charged with the task of eliminating a reference to an unperson in a newspaper article. He proceeds to write an article about '''Comrade Ogilvy''', a made-up party member who displayed great heroism by leaping into the sea from a helicopter so that the dispatches he was carrying would not fall into enemy hands.<ref>{{Cite book|title=1984|last=Orwell|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=part 1, chapter 4}}</ref>\n\n===Surveillance===\nThe inhabitants of [[Oceania (Ninteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]], particularly the Outer Party members, have no real privacy. Many of them live in apartments equipped with two-way [[telescreen]]s so that they may be watched or listened to at any time. Similar telescreens are found at workstations and in public places, along with hidden microphones. Written correspondence is routinely opened and read by the government before it is delivered. The Thought Police employ undercover agents, who pose as normal citizens and report any person with subversive tendencies. Children are encouraged to report suspicious persons to the government, and some denounce their parents. Citizens are controlled, and the smallest sign of rebellion, even something so small as a facial expression, can result in immediate arrest and imprisonment. Thus, citizens, particularly party members, are compelled to obedience.\n\n==Newspeak appendix==\n{{Main|Newspeak|List of Newspeak words}}\n\"The Principles of Newspeak\" is an academic essay appended to the novel. It describes the development of Newspeak, the Party's minimalist artificial language meant to ideologically align thought and action with the principles of Ingsoc by making \"all other modes of thought\" (i.e. any thoughts, concepts, or sayings that go against Ingsoc) impossible. The idea that the structure of language can be used to influence thought is known as [[linguistic relativity]].\n\nWhether or not the Newspeak appendix implies a hopeful end to ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' remains a critical debate, as it is in Standard English and refers to Newspeak, Ingsoc, the Party etc., in the [[past tense]]: \"Relative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised\" p.&nbsp;422).

Some time at an unspecified date after the first American publication of the book, producer [[Sidney Sheldon]] wrote to Orwell interested in adapting the novel to the Broadway stage. Orwell sold the American stage rights to Sheldon, explaining that his basic goal with ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' was imagining the consequences of Stalinist government ruling British society:\n<blockquote>[''Nineteen Eighty-Four''] was based chiefly on communism, because that is the dominant form of totalitarianism, but I was trying chiefly to imagine what communism would be like if it were firmly rooted in the English speaking countries, and was no longer a mere extension of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Russian Foreign Office]].<ref>Sheldon, Sidney (2006) ''The Other Side of Me'', Grand Central Publishing, p. 213</ref></blockquote> According to Orwell biographer [[D. J. Taylor]], the author's ''[[A Clergyman's Daughter]]'' (1935) has \"essentially the same plot of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' ... It's about somebody who is spied upon, and eavesdropped upon, and oppressed by vast exterior forces they can do nothing about. It makes an attempt at rebellion and then has to compromise\".<ref name=\"fivebookstaylor\">{{Cite interview |last=Taylor |first=D.

A large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete\"; ch 9) is evocative of the Soviet Union's changing relations with Nazi Germany. The two nations were open and frequently vehement critics of each other until the signing of the 1939 [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|Treaty of Non-Aggression]]. Thereafter, and continuing until the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, no criticism of Germany was allowed in the Soviet press, and all references to prior party lines stopped\u2014including in the majority of non-Russian communist parties who tended to follow the Russian line. Orwell had criticised the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] for supporting the Treaty in his essays for ''[[Betrayal of the Left]]'' (1941). \"The Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939 reversed the Soviet Union's stated foreign policy. It was too much for many of the [[fellow traveler|fellow-traveller]]s like [[Victor Gollancz|Gollancz]] [Orwell's sometime publisher] who had put their faith in a strategy of construction [[Popular Front]] governments and the peace bloc between Russia, Britain and France.\"<ref>Perry, Matt.

Regarding censorship, in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' the government tightly controls information to keep the population in line, but in Huxley's world, so much information is published that readers do not know which information is relevant, and what can be disregarded.\n\nElements of both novels can be seen in modern-day societies, with Huxley's vision being more dominant in the West and Orwell's vision more prevalent with dictators in ex-communist countries, as is pointed out in essays that compare the two novels, including Huxley's own ''Brave New World Revisited''.<ref>[http://www.huxley.net/bnw-revisited/ Aldous Huxley;s ''Brave New World Revisited'']</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/books/review/which-dystopian-novel-got-it-right-orwells-1984-or-huxleys-brave-new-world.html|title=Which Dystopian Novel Got It Right: Orwell's '1984' or Huxley's 'Brave New World'?|date=13 February 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=17 June 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/orwells-1984-and-trumps-america|title=Orwell's \"1984\" and Trump's America|website=The New Yorker|access-date=17 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"conway\" />\n\nComparisons with other dystopian novels like ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', ''[[Virtual Light]]'', ''[[The Private Eye]]'' and ''[[The Children of Men]]'' have also been drawn.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/26/1984-dystopias-reflect-trumps-us-orwell|title=Forget Nineteen Eighty-Four.

Of the two, Sophocles also won more dramatic contests. His chorus passages were more relevant to the plot and more integrated in tragedies, whereas the Euripidean choruses seemingly had little to do with the plot and were often bystanders.<ref name=\"weiner\"/> Aristotle stated in his ''Poetics'':\n\n{{quotation|\"The chorus too should be regarded as one of the actors; it should be an integral part of the whole, and share in the action, not in the manner of Euripides but of Sophocles\".<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'', chapter 18</ref>}}\n\nThe chorus represents, on stage, the general population of the particular story, in sharp contrast with many of the themes of the ancient Greek plays which tended to be about individual heroes, gods, and goddesses.  They were often the same sex as the main character.<ref name=\"montgomery\"/> In [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]]'', the chorus comprises the elderly men of [[Argos]], whereas in Euripides' ''[[The Bacchae]]'', they are a group of eastern [[Bacchants|bacchantes]], and in Sophocles' ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'', the chorus represents the women of Argos. In Aeschylus' ''[[The Eumenides]]'', however, the chorus takes the part of a host of avenging [[Furies]].\n\n==Choral structure and size==\nThe lines of choral odes provide evidence that they were sung. Normal syllabic structure has long sounds that are twice the length of short sounds. However, some lyrics in Greek odes have long syllables that are equal to 3, 4 and 5 shorter syllables. Spoken words cannot do that, suggesting that this was a danced and sung rhythm.<ref name=kitto/>\n\nThe chorus originally consisted of fifty members, but some later playwrights changed the size.

The chorus had to work in unison to help explain the play as there were only one to three actors on stage who were already playing several parts each.

To do this, they used techniques such as synchronization, echo, ripple, physical theatre and the use of masks to aid them. A Greek chorus was often led by a [[coryphaeus]]. They also served as the ancient equivalent for a curtain, as their parodos (entering procession) signified the beginnings of a play and their exodos (exit procession) served as the curtains closing.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Decline in antiquity==\nBefore the introduction of multiple, interacting actors by [[Aeschylus]], the Greek chorus was the main performer in relation to a solitary actor.<ref>Haigh, 1898, p. 319</ref><ref>Kitto, 2002, pp. 22, 27</ref> The importance of the chorus declined after the 5th century [[BCE]], when the chorus began to be separated from the dramatic action.

It was released in a [[Product bundling|bundle]], ''[[The Orange Box]],'' for [[Windows]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]], and has been since ported to other systems, including [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (via [[Nvidia Shield]]).\n\n''Portal'' consists primarily of a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using \"the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device\", a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. The player-character, [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], is challenged and taunted by an [[artificial intelligence]] named [[GLaDOS]] (Genetic Lifeform and [[Disk Operating System]]) to complete each puzzle in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are completed. The game's unique physics allows kinetic energy to be retained through portals, requiring creative use of portals to maneuver through the test chambers. This gameplay element is based on a similar concept from the game ''[[Narbacular Drop]]''; many of the team members from the [[DigiPen Institute of Technology]] who worked on ''Narbacular Drop'' were hired by Valve for the creation of ''Portal'', making it a [[spiritual successor]] to the game.\n\n''Portal'' was acclaimed as one of the most original games of 2007, despite criticisms of its short duration and limited story. The game received praise for its originality, unique gameplay and dark story with a humorous series of dialogue. GLaDOS, voiced by [[Ellen McLain]] in the English-language version, received acclaim for her unique characterization, and the end credits song \"[[Still Alive]]\", written by [[Jonathan Coulton]] for the game, was praised for its original composition and humorous twist. ''Portal'' is often cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. Excluding Steam download sales, over four million copies of the game have been sold since its release, spawning official merchandise from Valve including plush Companion Cubes, as well as fan recreations of the cake and portal gun. A standalone version, titled ''[[Portal: Still Alive]]'', was released on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service in October 2008, which added 14 puzzles to the gameplay, and a sequel, ''[[Portal 2]]'', which was released in 2011, adding several new gameplay mechanics and a cooperative multiplayer mode.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 150\n| image1 = Portal physics-2.svg\n| caption1 = A representation of how the ([[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of) [[linear momentum]] is conserved through portals.

The character builds up speed using two blue portals, to reach an otherwise unreachable area. The second blue portal is carefully created in mid-air, after exiting the orange portal for the first time, destroying the first blue portal in the process.\n}}\n\nIn ''Portal'', the player controls the protagonist, [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]] as she is challenged to navigate through a series of rooms using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or portal gun, under the watchful supervision of the artificial intelligence [[GLaDOS]]. The portal gun can create two distinct portal ends, orange and blue. The portals create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in [[three-dimensional space]]. Neither end is specifically an entrance or exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. An important aspect of the game's physics is momentum redirection.<ref name=\"commentary\">{{Cite video game|title = Portal|developer = [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|date = October 9, 2007|level = In-game developer commentary}}</ref> As moving objects pass through portals, they come through the exit portal at the same direction that the exit portal is facing and with the same speed with which they passed through the entrance portal.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3770/games_demystified_portal.php | title = Games Demystified: Portal | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | first = Jeremy | last = Alessi | date = August 26, 2008 | accessdate = August 28, 2008}}</ref> For example, a common maneuver is to jump down to a portal on the floor and emerge through a wall, flying over a gap or another obstacle. This allows the player to launch objects or Chell over great distances, both vertically and horizontally, referred to as 'flinging' by Valve.<ref name=\"commentary\" /> As GLaDOS puts it, \"In layman's terms: speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.\" If portal ends are not on parallel planes, the character passing through is reoriented to be upright with respect to gravity after leaving a portal end.\n\nChell and all other objects in the game that can fit into the portal ends will pass through the portal. However, a portal shot cannot pass through an open portal; it will simply deactivate or create a new portal in an offset position. Creating a portal end instantly deactivates an existing portal end of the same color. Moving objects, glass, special wall surfaces, liquids, or areas that are too small will not be able to anchor portals. Chell is sometimes provided with cubes that she can pick up and use to climb on or to hold down large buttons that open doors or activate mechanisms. Particle fields, known as \"Emancipation Grills\", occasionally called \"Fizzlers\" in the developer commentary, exist at the end of all and within some test chambers; when passed through, they will deactivate any active portals and disintegrate any object carried through. These fields also block attempts to fire portals through them.<ref name=\"360 manual\">{{cite book | title = The Orange Box manual (Xbox 360 version) | publisher = Valve | year = 2007 | pages = 12\u201317}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Chell is equipped with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling,<ref name=\"commentary\" /> she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects falling through portals, and by a series of crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no [[Health (gaming)|health]] indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.\n\n[[GameSpot]] noted, in its initial review of ''Portal'', that many solutions exist for completing each puzzle, and that the gameplay \"gets even crazier, and the diagrams shown in the trailer showed some incredibly crazy things that you can attempt\".<ref name=\"gamespotarticle1\">{{cite web |url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-2-episode-two-the-return-of-team-fortress-2-and-other-surprises/1100-6154006/|title = Half-Life 2: Episode Two&nbsp;\u2014 The Return of Team Fortress 2 and Other Surprises |accessdate = July 21, 2006 |author = Ocampo |date = July 13, 2006 |publisher = [[GameSpot]] |first = Jason}}</ref> Two additional modes are unlocked upon the completion of the game that challenge the player to work out alternative methods of solving each test chamber.

In the English-language version, GLaDOS is voiced by [[Ellen McLain]], though her voice has been altered to sound more artificial. The only background information presented about Chell is given by GLaDOS; the credibility of these facts, such as Chell being adopted, an orphan, and having no friends, is questionable at best, as GLaDOS is a liar by her own admission. In the \"Lab Rat\" comic created by Valve to bridge the gap between ''Portal'' and ''[[Portal 2]]'', Chell's records reveal she was ultimately rejected as a test subject for having \"too much tenacity\"\u2014the main reason Doug Rattman, a former employee of Aperture Science, moved Chell to the top of the test queue.<ref name=\"labrat part 1\" /><ref name=\"labrat part 2\" />\n\n===Setting===\n{{anchor|Aperture Science}}\n[[File:Aperture Laboratories Logo.svg|thumb|The logo for Aperture Science Laboratories]]\n''Portal'' takes place in the [[Aperture Science Laboratories|Aperture Science Laboratories Computer-Aided Enrichment Center]]\u2014Aperture Science for short\u2014which is a research facility responsible for the creation of the portal gun. According to information presented in ''Portal 2'', the location of the complex is in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]]. Aperture Science exists in the same universe as the [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'' series]], although connections between the two franchises are limited to references.\n\nInformation about the company, developed by Valve for creating the setting of the game, is revealed during the game and via the real-world promotional website.<ref name=\"gi apsci history\">{{cite web | url = http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/24/Aperture-Science_3A00_-A-History.aspx | title = Aperture Science: A History | first = Meagan | last = VanBurkleo | work = [[Game Informer]] | date = March 24, 2010 | accessdate = March 24, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100327072045/http://gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2010/03/24/Aperture-Science_3A00_-A-History.aspx | archive-date = March 27, 2010 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> According to the Aperture Science website, [[Cave Johnson (Portal)|Cave Johnson]] founded the company in 1943 for the sole purpose of making [[shower curtain]]s for the U.S. military. However, after becoming mentally unstable from \"moon rock poisoning\" in 1978, Johnson created a three-tier [[research and development]] plan to make his organization successful. The first two tiers, the [[Abdominal thrusts|Counter-Heimlich Maneuver]] (a maneuver designed to ensure choking) and the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation|Take-A-Wish Foundation]] (a program to give the wishes of terminally ill children to adults in need of dreams), were commercial failures and led to an investigation of the company by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. However, when the investigative committee heard of the success of the third tier\u2014a person-sized, ad-hoc quantum tunnel through physical space, with a possible application as a shower curtain\u2014it recessed permanently and gave Aperture Science an open-ended contract to continue its research.

Events of the first ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' game occur shortly after that, presumably leaving the facility forgotten by the outside world due to apocalyptic happenings. Wolpaw, in describing the ending of ''Portal 2'', affirmed that the [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] invasion, chronologically taking place after ''Half-Life'' and before ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', had occurred before ''Portal 2''{{'}}s events.<ref name=\"pcgamer p2 wolpaw interview\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/04/26/erik-wolpaw-on-portal-2s-ending-the-spoiler-is-probably-lurking-out-there-somewhere/ | title =Erik Wolpaw on Portal 2's ending: \"the [spoiler] is probably lurking out there somewhere\" | first = Rich | last = Stanton | date = April 26, 2011 | accessdate = April 26, 2011 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\nThe areas of the Enrichment Center that Chell explores suggest that it is part of a massive research installation.

Chell enters into distinct chambers that introduce players to the game's mechanics, sequentially. GLaDOS's announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game, but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person.<ref name=\"commentary\" /> Chell is promised [[cake]] as as her reward if she completes all test chambers.<ref name=\"gamespy pc review\">{{cite web | url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/portal/826434p1.html |title=Portal (PC) |first=Sal | last = Accardo | date = October 9, 2007 | accessdate = February 25, 2008 | publisher = GameSpy}}</ref>\n\nChell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center, with GLaDOS as her only interaction. As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives and behavior turn more sinister; although she is designed to appear encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, tests including a live-fire course designed for military androids, as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart on each face, for helping Chell to complete the test. However, GLaDOS declares it must be [[Euthanasia|euthanized]] in an \"emergency intelligence [[incinerator]]\" before Chell can continue.<ref name=\"1up pc review\" /> Some later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled.<ref name=\"eurogamer pc review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=85005 |title=Portal |first=Tom |last = Bradwell |date=October 10, 2007 | accessdate = February 25, 2008 | publisher = Eurogamer}}</ref><ref name=\"ign pc review\">{{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/825/825987p1.html | title = Portal Review | first = Dan | last = Adams | date = October 9, 2007 | accessdate = February 25, 2008 | publisher = IGN}}</ref>\n\nAfter Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS maneuvers Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her.

GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the \"party escort submission position\", lying face-first on the ground, so that a \"party associate\" can take her to her reward, but Chell continues her escape. In this section, GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center.<ref name=\"labrat part 1\" /><ref name=\"labrat part 2\" /> Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as \"the cake is a lie\", and [[pastiche]]s of [[Emily Dickinson]]'s poem \"The Chariot\", [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s \"The Reaper and the Flowers\", and [[Emily Bront\u00eb]]'s \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.<ref name=\"commentary\" />\n\nGLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple \"personality cores\" that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas. With it removed, she can access its emitters again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally, with  taunts and juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell destroys the last personality core, a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. Following the announcement of ''[[Portal 2]]'', the ending was expanded in a later update. In this [[retroactive continuity]], Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the \"party escort submission position\".<ref name=\"gi portal hl\" /><ref name=\"shacknews update 2\" />\n\nThe final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a [[Black Forest cake]],<ref name=\"german chocolate\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gametrailers.com/gametrailerstv_player.php?ep=10&sd=1&ch=4 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080305005301/http://www.gametrailers.com/gametrailerstv_player.php?ep=10&sd=1&ch=4 | archivedate = March 5, 2008 | title = GameTrailers Episode 106 | accessdate = March 25, 2008 | author = Geoff, Keighley | date = March 1, 2008 | publisher = GameTrailers.com |url-status = live}}</ref> and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores.

It was released in a [[Product bundling|bundle]], ''[[The Orange Box]],'' for [[Windows]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]], and has been since ported to other systems, including [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (via [[Nvidia Shield]]).\n\n''Portal'' consists primarily of a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using \"the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device\", a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. The player-character, [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], is challenged and taunted by an [[artificial intelligence]] named [[GLaDOS]] (Genetic Lifeform and [[Disk Operating System]]) to complete each puzzle in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are completed. The game's unique physics allows kinetic energy to be retained through portals, requiring creative use of portals to maneuver through the test chambers. This gameplay element is based on a similar concept from the game ''[[Narbacular Drop]]''; many of the team members from the [[DigiPen Institute of Technology]] who worked on ''Narbacular Drop'' were hired by Valve for the creation of ''Portal'', making it a [[spiritual successor]] to the game.\n\n''Portal'' was acclaimed as one of the most original games of 2007, despite criticisms of its short duration and limited story. The game received praise for its originality, unique gameplay and dark story with a humorous series of dialogue. GLaDOS, voiced by [[Ellen McLain]] in the English-language version, received acclaim for her unique characterization, and the end credits song \"[[Still Alive]]\", written by [[Jonathan Coulton]] for the game, was praised for its original composition and humorous twist. ''Portal'' is often cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. Excluding Steam download sales, over four million copies of the game have been sold since its release, spawning official merchandise from Valve including plush Companion Cubes, as well as fan recreations of the cake and portal gun. A standalone version, titled ''[[Portal: Still Alive]]'', was released on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service in October 2008, which added 14 puzzles to the gameplay, and a sequel, ''[[Portal 2]]'', which was released in 2011, adding several new gameplay mechanics and a cooperative multiplayer mode.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 150\n| image1 = Portal physics-2.svg\n| caption1 = A representation of how the ([[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of) [[linear momentum]] is conserved through portals.

The character builds up speed using two blue portals, to reach an otherwise unreachable area. The second blue portal is carefully created in mid-air, after exiting the orange portal for the first time, destroying the first blue portal in the process.\n}}\n\nIn ''Portal'', the player controls the protagonist, [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]] as she is challenged to navigate through a series of rooms using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or portal gun, under the watchful supervision of the artificial intelligence [[GLaDOS]]. The portal gun can create two distinct portal ends, orange and blue. The portals create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in [[three-dimensional space]]. Neither end is specifically an entrance or exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. An important aspect of the game's physics is momentum redirection.<ref name=\"commentary\">{{Cite video game|title = Portal|developer = [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|date = October 9, 2007|level = In-game developer commentary}}</ref> As moving objects pass through portals, they come through the exit portal at the same direction that the exit portal is facing and with the same speed with which they passed through the entrance portal.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3770/games_demystified_portal.php | title = Games Demystified: Portal | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | first = Jeremy | last = Alessi | date = August 26, 2008 | accessdate = August 28, 2008}}</ref> For example, a common maneuver is to jump down to a portal on the floor and emerge through a wall, flying over a gap or another obstacle. This allows the player to launch objects or Chell over great distances, both vertically and horizontally, referred to as 'flinging' by Valve.<ref name=\"commentary\" /> As GLaDOS puts it, \"In layman's terms: speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.\" If portal ends are not on parallel planes, the character passing through is reoriented to be upright with respect to gravity after leaving a portal end.\n\nChell and all other objects in the game that can fit into the portal ends will pass through the portal. However, a portal shot cannot pass through an open portal; it will simply deactivate or create a new portal in an offset position. Creating a portal end instantly deactivates an existing portal end of the same color. Moving objects, glass, special wall surfaces, liquids, or areas that are too small will not be able to anchor portals. Chell is sometimes provided with cubes that she can pick up and use to climb on or to hold down large buttons that open doors or activate mechanisms. Particle fields, known as \"Emancipation Grills\", occasionally called \"Fizzlers\" in the developer commentary, exist at the end of all and within some test chambers; when passed through, they will deactivate any active portals and disintegrate any object carried through.

As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives and behavior turn more sinister than her helpful demeanor suggests; although she is designed to appear helpful and encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, and GLaDOS even directs Chell through a live-fire course designed for military androids as a result of \"mandatory scheduled maintenance\" in the regular test chamber, as well as having some test chambers flooded with a bio-hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS boasts about the fidelity and importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart centered on each face, for helping Chell to complete the chamber. However, GLaDOS then declares that it \"unfortunately must be [[Euthanasia|euthanized]]\" in an \"emergency intelligence [[incinerator]]\" before Chell can continue.<ref name=\"1up pc review\" /> Some of the later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled, such as \"I don't blame you\" and \"No hard feelings\".<ref name=\"eurogamer pc review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=85005 |title=Portal |first=Tom |last = Bradwell |date=October 10, 2007 | accessdate = February 25, 2008 | publisher = Eurogamer}}</ref><ref name=\"ign pc review\">{{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/825/825987p1.html | title = Portal Review | first = Dan | last = Adams | date = October 9, 2007 | accessdate = February 25, 2008 | publisher = IGN}}</ref>\n\nAfter Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS congratulates her and prepares her \"victory candescence\", maneuvering Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her.

GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the \"party escort submission position\", lying face-first on the ground, so that a \"party associate\" can take her to her reward, but Chell continues anyway. Throughout this section, GLaDOS still sends messages to Chell and it becomes clear that she became corrupt and had killed everyone else in the center, which is also revealed in a later comic.<ref name=\"labrat part 1\" /><ref name=\"labrat part 2\" /> Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as \"the cake is a lie\", and [[pastiche]]s of [[Emily Dickinson]]'s poem \"The Chariot\", [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s \"The Reaper and the Flowers\", and [[Emily Bront\u00eb]]'s \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.<ref name=\"commentary\" />\n\nGLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements claiming that she is going the wrong way as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Eventually, Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to plead with and threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple \"personality cores\" which the Aperture Science employees allegedly installed after GLaDOS flooded the enrichment center with a deadly neurotoxin gas, and goes on to state that now there is nothing to prevent her from doing so once again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS attempts to discourage her both verbally, with a series of taunts and increasingly juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell has destroyed the final personality core, a portal malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. One of the final scenes is changed through a patch of the PC version that was made available a few days before ''Portal 2''{{'}}s announcement; in this [[retroactive continuity]], Chell is dragged away from the scene by an unseen entity speaking in a robotic voice, thanking her for assuming the \"party escort submission position\", revealing the entity to be a \"party associate\".<ref name=\"gi portal hl\" /><ref name=\"shacknews update 2\" />\n\nThe final scene, after a long and speedy zoom through the bowels of the facility, shows a [[Black Forest cake]],<ref name=\"german chocolate\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gametrailers.com/gametrailerstv_player.php?ep=10&sd=1&ch=4 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080305005301/http://www.gametrailers.com/gametrailerstv_player.php?ep=10&sd=1&ch=4 | archivedate = March 5, 2008 | title = GameTrailers Episode 106 | accessdate = March 25, 2008 | author = Geoff, Keighley | date = March 1, 2008 | publisher = GameTrailers.com |url-status = live}}</ref> and the Weighted Companion Cube, surrounded by a mix of shelves containing dozens of apparently inactive personality cores.

Al-Hibri began work on the journal in 1982, after she had completed her PhD in philosophy and just as she was starting her first year of [[law school]]. The philosophy and women's studies departments at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] offered support in the form of an office and research assistance.[[Women's Studies International Forum|''Women's Studies International Forum'']] agreed to publish the new journal as an annual \"piggy back\" issue of its own, which it did for three years, and distributed 10,000 brochures to its mailing list advertising it.\n\nThe group led by Al-Hibri decided that submissions would be fully reviewed and that substantive comments would be offered, Alcoff wrote, rather than the usual brief rejection, to help authors improve their work and to contribute to the field's development. Donna Serniak ([[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]]) was responsible for the first issue. It was first published independently of ''Women's Studies International Forum'' in 1986.\n\nThe journal is named after [[Hypatia of Alexandria]], a mathematician and philosopher who was murdered by a mob in 415 CE. Al-Hibri said that the SWIP editorial board chose the name to reflect that women have \"deep roots in philosophy\". According to [[Linda L\u00f3pez McAlister]] ([[University of South Florida|USF]]), the idea for the name came from Sue Larson ([[Barnard College|Barnard]]) during a meeting of Eastern SWIP in 1973. [[Sandra Harding]] ([[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]), who was at the meeting, objected, thinking it awful to name a feminist-philosophy journal after a woman who had been \"stoned to death for telling the truth\". The first suggestion was ''Hypatia: A Journal of Philosophy and Feminism'', rather than ''A Journal of Feminist Philosophy'', because at the time it was unclear what feminist philosophy might be.\n\nThroughout Hypatia\u2019s thirty-three-year history, the journal has been influential in legitimizing feminist philosophy within the field. It has served as one of the most pivotal sources of scholarship in feminist philosophy, both because it showcases a wide range of feminist viewpoints and because it has self-consciously addressed varied views and issues in the discipline. In a editorial statement titled \u201cThe Promise of Feminist Philosophy,\u201d the editors note that:<blockquote>Hypatia\u2019s specific history in this regard is complex. The journal\u2019s editors have often addressed questions of disciplinary pluralism, demographic exclusion and marginalization, and the journal\u2019s own role in setting the agenda for feminist agitation or compliance within the academy...The special issue structure has sometimes allowed ''Hypatia'' to create space for scholars who are subjected to the most persistent forms of marginalization in the discipline, and for intersectional feminist work, even as ''Hypatia'' as a whole has been justly criticized for the underrepresentation of such work.<sup><sup>[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hypa.12490 <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]</sup></sup>...More recently, the development of ''Hypatia'' clusters (a set of two or more articles on a single theme in an open issue) offers another avenue that might be employed to highlight work that is marginalized in the larger discipline.</blockquote>\n\n==Governance==\n''Hypatia'' is owned by a non-profit corporation, Hypatia Inc.,<ref name=ProPublica/> registered in April 2008 in the State of Washington.

Al-Hibri began work on the journal in 1982, after she had completed her PhD in philosophy and just as she was starting her first year of [[law school]]. The philosophy and women's studies departments at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] offered support in the form of an office and research assistance.[[Women's Studies International Forum|''Women's Studies International Forum'']] agreed to publish the new journal as an annual \"piggy back\" issue of its own, which it did for three years, and distributed 10,000 brochures to its mailing list advertising it.\n\nThe group led by Al-Hibri decided that submissions would be fully reviewed and that substantive comments would be offered, Alcoff wrote, rather than the usual brief rejection, to help authors improve their work and to contribute to the field's development. Donna Serniak ([[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]]) was responsible for the first issue. It was first published independently of ''Women's Studies International Forum'' in 1986.\n\nThe journal is named after [[Hypatia of Alexandria]], a mathematician and philosopher who was murdered by a mob in 415 CE. Al-Hibri said that the SWIP editorial board chose the name to reflect that women have \"deep roots in philosophy\". According to [[Linda L\u00f3pez McAlister]] ([[University of South Florida|USF]]), the idea for the name came from Sue Larson ([[Barnard College|Barnard]]) during a meeting of Eastern SWIP in 1973. [[Sandra Harding]] ([[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]), who was at the meeting, objected, thinking it awful to name a feminist-philosophy journal after a woman who had been \"stoned to death for telling the truth\". The first suggestion was ''Hypatia: A Journal of Philosophy and Feminism'', rather than ''A Journal of Feminist Philosophy'', because at the time it was unclear what feminist philosophy might be.\n\nThroughout Hypatia\u2019s thirty-three-year history, the journal has been influential in legitimizing feminist philosophy within the field. It has served as one of the most pivotal sources of scholarship in feminist philosophy, both because it showcases a wide range of feminist viewpoints and because it has self-consciously addressed varied views and issues in the discipline. In a editorial statement titled \u201cThe Promise of Feminist Philosophy,\u201d the editors note that:<blockquote>Hypatia\u2019s specific history in this regard is complex. The journal\u2019s editors have often addressed questions of disciplinary pluralism, demographic exclusion and marginalization, and the journal\u2019s own role in setting the agenda for feminist agitation or compliance within the academy...The special issue structure has sometimes allowed ''Hypatia'' to create space for scholars who are subjected to the most persistent forms of marginalization in the discipline, and for intersectional feminist work, even as ''Hypatia'' as a whole has been justly criticized for the underrepresentation of such work.<sup><sup>[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hypa.12490 <nowiki>[1]</nowiki>]</sup></sup>...More recently, the development of ''Hypatia'' clusters (a set of two or more articles on a single theme in an open issue) offers another avenue that might be employed to highlight work that is marginalized in the larger discipline.</blockquote>\n\n==Governance==\n''Hypatia'' is owned by a non-profit corporation, Hypatia Inc.,<ref name=ProPublica/> registered in April 2008 in the State of Washington.

Despite this success, Henderson was reprimanded for secretly using hospital facilities to build the machine.<ref name=\"Wills\">{{cite book| last=Wills| first=Elspeth| title=Scottish Firsts: A Celebration of Innovation and Achievement| publisher=[[Mainstream Publishing]]| location=Edinburgh| year=2002| pages=[https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51 51\u20132]| isbn=978-1840186116| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite web| last=Thomas| first=Campbell| date=15 February 2000| url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/dr-robert-henderson-1.249085| title=Dr Robert Henderson | work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]| accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Both respirator===\n[[File:Both Cabinet Respirator in WWII.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Both cabinet respirator being used to treat a patient at the 110th Australian Military Hospital in 1943]]\n{{main|Both respirator}}\nThe [[Both respirator]], a negative pressure ventilator, was invented in 1937 when Australia's epidemic of poliomyelitis created an immediate need for more ventilating machines to compensate for respiratory paralysis. Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500. Consequently, there were few of the Drinker devices in Australia and Europe.<ref name=\"Trubuhovich\">{{cite journal |last=Trubuhovich| first=Ronald V.| title=Notable Australian contributions to the management of ventilatory failure of acute poliomyelitis| journal=Critical Care and Resuscitation| year=2006| volume=8| issue=4| pages=383\u20135| pmid=17227281}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Government of South Australia#Department for Health and Ageing (SA Health)|South Australia Health Department]] asked Adelaide brothers Edward and Don Both to create an inexpensive \"iron lung\".<ref name=\"Healey\">{{cite web| last=Healey| first=John| year=1998| url=http://www.samhs.org.au/Virtual%20Museum/Medicine/Bothurinlung/bothironlung-netley.html| title=The Both Brothers and the 'Iron Lung' | publisher=South Australian Medical Heritage Society Inc| accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref> Biomedical engineer [[Edward Both]] designed and developed a cabinet respirator made of plywood that worked similarly to the Drinker device, with the addition of a bi-valved design which allowed temporary access to the patient's body.<ref name=\"Trubuhovich\" /> Far cheaper to make (only \u00a3100) than the Drinker machine, the Both Respirator also weighed less and could be constructed and transported more quickly.<ref name=\"Trubuhovich\" /><ref name=\"SMH\">{{cite news| date=2004-12-07| url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Memories-of-polio-and-those-who-wrestled-with-it/2004/12/06/1102182223039.html| title=Memories of polio and those who wrestled with it | newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]| accessdate=2013-03-10}}</ref> Such was the demand for the machines that they were often used by patients within an hour of production.<ref name=\"Langmore\">{{cite book| editor-last=Langmore| editor-first=Diane| title=Australian Dictionary of Biography: Volume 17 1981-1990 A-K| publisher=[[Melbourne University Publishing]]| location=Carlton, Victoria| year=2009| page=129| isbn=978-0522853827}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Morris Iron Lung Thackray.jpg|thumb|right|Both-Nuffield iron lung display at the [[Thackray Medical Museum]], Leeds.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does. However, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing. At least one reported polio patient, [[Dianne Odell]], had a spinal deformity that caused the use of mechanical ventilators to be [[contraindicated]].<ref name=Sydney2008>{{cite news|author=|title=Power failure kills iron lung lady|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2008-05-29|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/world/power-failure-kills-iron-lung-lady/2008/05/29/1211654160059.html|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref> There are patients who today still use the older machines, often in their homes, despite the occasional difficulty of finding the various replacement parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/60-years-iron-lung-us-polio-survivor-worries-about-new-2D11641456|title=60 years in an iron lung: US polio survivor worries about new global threat|publisher=}}</ref> Joan Headley of [[Post-Polio Health International]] said that as of May 28, 2008, there were about 30 patients in the U.S. still using an iron lung.<ref name=CNN2008>{{cite news|title=Woman dies after life spent in iron lung |date=May 28, 2008 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/iron.lung.death.ap/index.html |accessdate=2011-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022162511/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/iron.lung.death.ap/index.html |archivedate=October 22, 2008 }}</ref> That figure may be inaccurately low; [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] alone had 19 iron lung patients living at home in 2008.<ref name=Neergaard2009>{{cite news|author=Lauran Neergaard|title=Emergency officials struggle to find those on life-support during power outages|date=2009-01-13|url=http://www.ems1.com/survivability/articles/447100-Emergency-officials-struggle-to-find-those-on-life-support-during-power-outages|accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref> [[Martha Mason (writer)|Martha Mason]] of [[Lattimore, North Carolina]], died on May 4, 2009, after spending 60 of her 72 years in an iron lung.<ref name=Fox2009>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Martha Mason, Who Wrote Book About Her Decades in an Iron Lung, Dies at 71|work=The New York Times|date=2009-05-10|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/us/10mason.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=iron%20lung&st=cse|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 October 2009, [[June Middleton]] of [[Melbourne, Australia]], who had been entered in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the person who spent the longest time in an iron lung, died aged 83, having spent more than 60 years in her iron lung.<ref name=Sydney2009>{{cite news|author=|title=Dead after 60 years in iron lung|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2009-11-01|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/dead-after-60-years-in-iron-lung-20091101-hqyy.html?autostart=1|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the [[Post-Polio Health International]] (PHI) organizations estimated that there were only six to eight iron lung users in the United States; as of 2017 its executive director knew of none.
