However, without reason for collection, stamps at this time were used for pasting wallpaper. The first philatelist is considered to be a postmaster going by Mansen, who lived in [[Paris]], and in 1855 had sold his collection, which contained almost all the postage stamps issued by that time. The stamp merchant and second-hand book dealer Edard de Laplante bought it, recognizing the definitive collector's worth of the postage stamp.<ref>[[Philatelic calendar]] for 1973.\u00a0\u2014 \u041c: Connection, 1972.\u00a0\u2014 16\u201422 July.</ref> Due to the boom in popularity and news of this transaction, stamp merchants like Laplante began to emerge.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century stamp collecting reached hundreds of thousands of people of all classes. Even some states had collections of [[postage stamp]]s, for example, [[England]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Bavaria]], and [[Bulgaria]]). In countries who held national collections, museums were built to dedicate that nation's history with philately, and the first such appeared in Germany, France, and Bulgaria. Allegedly, the first of these museums housed the collection of the [[British Museum]], curated by MP [[Thomas Tapling|Tapling]] and bequeathed to the Museum in 1891.

There are hundreds of popular subjects, such as birds, and ships, poets, presidents, monarchs, maps, aircraft, spacecraft, sports, and insects on stamps. Stamps depicted on stamps also constitute a topical area of collecting. Interesting aspects of topical philately include design mistakes and alterations; for instance, the recent editing out of cigarettes from the pictures used for United States stamps, and the stories of how particular images came to be used.\n* [[Postal history]] studies the postal systems and how they operate and, or, the study of postage stamps and covers and associated material illustrating historical episodes of postal systems both before and after the introduction of the adhesive stamps. It includes the study of [[postmark]]s, [[post office]]s, [[Postal Authorities|postal authorities]], postal rates and regulations and the process by which letters are moved from sender to recipient, including routes and choice of conveyance.  A classic example is the [[Pony Express]], which was the fastest way to send letters across the United States during the few months that it operated.  [[Cover (philately)|Covers]] that can be proven to have been sent by the Pony Express are highly prized by collectors.\n* [[Aerophilately]] is the branch of [[postal history]] that specializes in the study of [[airmail]]. Philatelists have observed the development of mail transport by air from its beginning, and all aspects of airmail services have been extensively studied and documented by specialists.\n*[[Astrophilately]] is the branch of [[Postal history|postal history]] that specializes in the study of stamps and postmarked envelopes that are connected to outer space.\n* [[Postal stationery]] includes [[stamped envelope]]s, [[postal card]]s, [[letter sheet]]s, [[Aerogram|a\u00e9rogramme]]s (airletter sheets) and [[Wrapper (philately)|wrappers]], most of which have an [[Embossing (paper)|embossed]] or [[imprinted stamp]] or [[Indicia (philately)|indicia]] indicating the prepayment of postage.\n* [[Cinderella stamp|Erinnophilia]] is the study of objects that look like stamps, but are not postal stamps. Examples include [[Easter seals (philately)|Easter Seals]], [[Christmas Seal]]s, propaganda labels, and so forth.\n* [[Philatelic literature]] documents the results of the philatelic study and includes thousands of books and periodicals.\n* [[Revenue stamp|Revenue philately]] is the study of stamps used to collect taxes or fees on such things as legal documents, court fees, receipts, tobacco, alcoholic drinks, drugs and medicines, playing cards, hunting licenses and newspapers.\n* [[Maximaphily]] is the study of Maximum Cards. Maximum Cards can be defined as a picture postcard with a postage stamp on the same theme and cancellation, with a maximum concordance between all three.\n*Youth philately is the study of stamps with colorful characters. It is mainly aimed at getting children interested in stamp collecting.\n\n==Tools==\nPhilately uses several tools, including [[stamp tongs]] (a specialized form of tweezers) to safely handle the stamps, a strong magnifying glass and a [[perforation gauge]] (odontometer) to measure the perforation gauge of the stamp.\n\nThe identification of [[watermark]]s is equally important and may be done with the naked eye by turning the stamp over or holding it up to the light. If this fails then ''watermark fluid'' may be used, which \"wets\" the stamp to reveal the mark.\n\nOther common tools include [[stamp catalog]]s, [[stamp stock book]]s and [[stamp hinge]]s.\n\n==Organizations==\n[[File:Spring Stampex 2011.jpg|thumb|A large [[stamp show]] (philatelic exhibition) at which collectors and dealers meet.]]\nPhilatelic organizations sprang up soon after people started collecting and studying stamps. They include local, national and international clubs and societies where collectors come together to share the various aspects of their hobby.\n\nThe world's oldest philatelic society is the [[Royal Philatelic Society London]], which was founded on April 10, 1869, as the Philatelic Society. In North America, the major national societies include the [[American Philatelic Society]]; the [[Royal Philatelic Society of Canada]]; and the [[MEPSI|Mexico-Elmhurst Philatelic Society, International]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of notable postage stamps]]\n*[[List of philatelic topics]]\n*[[List of philatelists]]\n*[[List of philatelic awards]]\n*[[Postal history]]\n*[[Stamp collecting]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[A.

Interesting aspects of topical philately include design mistakes and alterations; for instance, the recent editing out of cigarettes from the pictures used for United States stamps, and the stories of how particular images came to be used.\n* [[Postal history]] studies the postal systems and how they operate and, or, the study of postage stamps and covers and associated material illustrating historical episodes of postal systems both before and after the introduction of the adhesive stamps. It includes the study of [[postmark]]s, [[post office]]s, [[Postal Authorities|postal authorities]], postal rates and regulations and the process by which letters are moved from sender to recipient, including routes and choice of conveyance.  A classic example is the [[Pony Express]], which was the fastest way to send letters across the United States during the few months that it operated.  [[Cover (philately)|Covers]] that can be proven to have been sent by the Pony Express are highly prized by collectors.\n* [[Aerophilately]] is the branch of [[postal history]] that specializes in the study of [[airmail]]. Philatelists have observed the development of mail transport by air from its beginning, and all aspects of airmail services have been extensively studied and documented by specialists.\n*[[Astrophilately]] is the branch of [[Postal history|postal history]] that specializes in the study of stamps and postmarked envelopes that are connected to outer space.\n* [[Postal stationery]] includes [[stamped envelope]]s, [[postal card]]s, [[letter sheet]]s, [[Aerogram|a\u00e9rogramme]]s (airletter sheets) and [[Wrapper (philately)|wrappers]], most of which have an [[Embossing (paper)|embossed]] or [[imprinted stamp]] or [[Indicia (philately)|indicia]] indicating the prepayment of postage.\n* [[Cinderella stamp|Erinnophilia]] is the study of objects that look like stamps, but are not postal stamps. Examples include [[Easter seals (philately)|Easter Seals]], [[Christmas Seal]]s, propaganda labels, and so forth.\n* [[Philatelic literature]] documents the results of the philatelic study and includes thousands of books and periodicals.\n* [[Revenue stamp|Revenue philately]] is the study of stamps used to collect taxes or fees on such things as legal documents, court fees, receipts, tobacco, alcoholic drinks, drugs and medicines, playing cards, hunting licenses and newspapers.\n* [[Maximaphily]] is the study of Maximum Cards. Maximum Cards can be defined as a picture postcard with a postage stamp on the same theme and cancellation, with a maximum concordance between all three.\n*Youth philately is the study of stamps with colorful characters. It is mainly aimed at getting Children interested in stamp collecting.\n\n==Tools==\nPhilately uses several tools, including [[stamp tongs]] (a specialized form of tweezers) to safely handle the stamps, a strong magnifying glass and a [[perforation gauge]] (odontometer) to measure the perforation gauge of the stamp.\n\nThe identification of [[watermark]]s is equally important and may be done with the naked eye by turning the stamp over or holding it up to the light. If this fails then ''watermark fluid'' may be used, which \"wets\" the stamp to reveal the mark.\n\nOther common tools include [[stamp catalog]]s, [[stamp stock book]]s and [[stamp hinge]]s.\n\n==Organizations==\n[[File:Spring Stampex 2011.jpg|thumb|A large [[stamp show]] (philatelic exhibition) at which collectors and dealers meet.]]\nPhilatelic organizations sprang up soon after people started collecting and studying stamps. They include local, national and international clubs and societies where collectors come together to share the various aspects of their hobby.\n\nThe world's oldest philatelic society is the [[Royal Philatelic Society London]], which was founded on April 10, 1869, as the Philatelic Society. In North America, the major national societies include the [[American Philatelic Society]]; the [[Royal Philatelic Society of Canada]]; and the [[MEPSI|Mexico-Elmhurst Philatelic Society, International]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of notable postage stamps]]\n*[[List of philatelic topics]]\n*[[List of philatelists]]\n*[[List of philatelic awards]]\n*[[Postal history]]\n*[[Stamp collecting]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[A.

After Duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw's death in 1282, Bolko I and his brother [[Casimir of Bytom|Casimir]] inherited [[Opole]] as co-rulers, while his other two brothers, [[Mieszko I, Duke of Cieszyn|Mieszko I]] and [[Przemys\u0142aw of Racib\u00f3rz|Przemys\u0142aw]] inherited [[Racib\u00f3rz]] also as co-rulers.\n\nThe common rule between Bolko I and Casimir lasted two years, until 1284, when the formal division was made of their domains. Bolko I retained the main city of Opole and Casimir received [[Bytom]].\n\nFor unknown reasons, Bolko I chose to follow different politics than his brothers and began a close cooperation with [[Henry IV Probus]], Duke of [[Wroc\u0142aw]]. In particular, this was clearly revealed in the long-time conflict between Henry IV and Bishop [[Thomas II Zaremba]]: Bolko I actively supported Henry IV's politics (for example, in 1283 the Duke of Opole took part in the Congress of episcopal rulers in [[Nysa, Poland|Nysa]]). In 1287, in an ongoing conflict with the Church's secular power, Bolko I made mediation attempts between them and Henry IV prior to a full military victory over the Duke of Wroc\u0142aw.\n\nOn 30 September 1288 [[Leszek II the Black]], Duke of [[Krak\u00f3w]] and [[Sandomierz]] died without issue. The first pretenders to the Krak\u00f3w throne were initially the Duke of [[P\u0142ock]], [[Boles\u0142aw II of P\u0142ock|Boles\u0142aw II]] and Henry IV Probus. The military assistance of Dukes [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]] of [[Kuyavia]] and [[Casimir II of \u0141\u0119czyca|Casimir II]] of [[\u0141\u0119czyca]] initially gave the victory to Boles\u0142aw II. On 26 February 1289, an unexpected Silesian army under the command of Dukes [[Henry III, Duke of G\u0142og\u00f3w|Henry III of G\u0142og\u00f3w]], [[Przemko of \u015acinawa]] and Bolko I of Opole attacked [[Siewierz]], counting on the support of the Governor of Krak\u00f3w, castellan Sulk the Bear (''Su\u0142k z Nied\u017awiedzia''). The extremely bloody battle ended with the defeat of the Silesian troops. Duke Przemko of \u015acinawa was killed in battle and Bolko I was seriously wounded and captured by W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high, who released him one year later after he paid a large ransom.\n\nOn 23 June 1290, Henry IV Probus died unexpectedly, probably poisoned. In his will, he left his inheritance to Dukes Henry III of G\u0142og\u00f3w and [[Przemys\u0142 II]] of [[Greater Poland]] (some historians{{Who|date=September 2015}} supported the theory of Thomas Jurek, who believed that Henry IV's true heir over Wroc\u0142aw and Krak\u00f3w was Bolko I). The Duke of Opole then decided on an alliance with King [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]]. On 17 January 1291 in [[Olomouc]] a formal agreement was signed, in which Bolko I, together with Mieszko I and Casimir agreed to fight with his own troops against any enemy of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]]. With this treaty, homage was also performed to the Bohemian crown; however, it's unknown if that tribute was only to King Wenceslaus II personally, or was extended to his successors (some historians{{Who|date=September 2015}} stated that the homage was made one year later, in 1292). In subsequent years Bolko I actively supported the Polish politics of the Bohemian king. In 1292 the Duke of Opole took part in the expedition at [[Sieradz]] against W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high. Once again, war with the Duke of Kuyavia started in 1296, when Bolko I supported Henry III of G\u0142og\u00f3w in his attempt to conquer [[Greater Poland]].\n\nThe close cooperation between the Bohemian Kingdom and Bolko I soon brought to him a significant increase in international political affairs. In 1297, he took part in the coronation of his protector King Wenceslaus II, and was appointed as a mediator in the conflict between the Church hierarchy of Olomouc and Wroc\u0142aw. One year later (in 1298), the importance of the Duke of Opole reached his apogee, when he was sent to [[Mainz]] as a representative of King Wenceslaus II, in the Electors meeting that chose [[Albert I of Habsburg]] as a new German King. Later that year, Bolko I supported the expedition against the deposed King [[Adolf of Nassau-Weilburg|Adolf of Nassau]].\n\nIn 1300 Bolko I took part in the trip of Wenceslaus II to Greater and his coronation as [[King of Poland]]. Shortly after, the Duke of Opole's faithful services were rewarded when he was appointed [[Starost]] of Krak\u00f3w.\n\nThe extinction of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty in 1306 broke the existing alliance of Bolko I with the Bohemian Kingdom and began to improve the already significantly tightening relations with his neighbors. Soon after the death of King Wenceslaus II, Bolko I could only obtain [[Wielu\u0144]]. The Duke of Opole tried to return to the political scene in 1311, at the beginning of the [[Rebellion of w\u00f3jt Albert]]. It's unknown if the Duke heard the complaints of the burghers of Krak\u00f3w against W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high and appeared in [[Lesser Poland]] in April 1312 following his own interests, or just as the new Governor appointed by the new Bohemian King [[John of Luxembourg]]. In any event, Bolko I couldn't cope with [[Wawel castle]] and soon returned to Opole, where he imprisoned the leader of the rebellion, w\u00f3jt (Mayor) Albert.\n\nIn internal politics, Bolko I was known mainly for his extraordinary generosity to the Church. In particular, he supported the [[Cistercian]] monastery in [[Jemielnica]], and the [[Franciscan]] Church, where he built the chapel of St. Anna. He also made the economic development of his Duchy after granted to many localities German laws ([[Magdeburg Law]]).\n\nBolko I died on 14 May 1313 and was buried in the Franciscan church in Opole.\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nBy 1280, Bolko I married a certain Agnes (d. by 1301), whose origins are unknown.<ref>[https://archive.is/20121210090750/http://wwperson.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/cgi-bin/llmult/LANG=engl/P=7005543 Genealogical database by Herbert Stoyan]</ref><ref>{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/SILESIA.htm#BoleslawIdied1313B |title-date= |title= SILESIA|date=August 2012}}</ref> According to some sources, she was probably the daughter of Margrave [[Otto III, Margrave of Brandenburg|Otto III of Brandenburg]].<ref>[http://www.poczet.com/opolski.htm BOLKO I OPOLSKI].

Covertly financed and directed by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]], the operation took place at the height of the [[Cold War]] and its failure led to major shifts in international relations between Cuba, the [[United States]], and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nIn 1952, American ally General [[Fulgencio Batista]] led a [[1952 Cuban coup d'\u00e9tat | coup]] against President [[Carlos Pr\u00edo Socarr\u00e1s|Carlos Prio]], and forced Prio into exile in Miami. Prio's exile inspired the creation of the [[26th July Movement]] by Castro. The Movement successfully completed the [[Cuban Revolution]] in December 1958. Castro nationalized American businesses\u2014including banks, oil refineries, and sugar and coffee plantations\u2014then severed Cuba's formerly-close relations with the United States and reached out to its Cold War rival, the Soviet Union. In response, US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] allocated $13.1 million to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in March 1960, for use against Castro. With the aid of Cuban counter-revolutionaries, the CIA proceeded to organize an invasion operation.\n\nAfter Castro's victory, Cuban exiles who had traveled to the US had formed the [[counter-revolutionary]] military unit [[Brigade 2506]]. The Brigade fronted the armed wing of the [[Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front|Democratic Revolutionary Front]] (DRF) and its purpose was to overthrow Castro's [[Politics of Cuba|increasingly-communist government]]. The CIA funded the Brigade, which also included some [[United States Armed Forces|US military]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-2134|title=Bay of Pigs Invasion and the Alabama Air National Guard {{!}} Encyclopedia of Alabama|website=Encyclopedia of Alabama|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref> personnel, and trained the unit in [[Guatemala]]. \n\nOver 1,400 paramilitaries, divided into five infantry battalions and one paratrooper battalion, assembled and launched from Guatemala and [[Nicaragua]] by boat on 17 April 1961. Two days earlier, eight CIA-supplied [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26]] bombers had attacked Cuban airfields and then returned to the US. On the night of 17 April, the main invasion force landed on the beach at [[Playa Gir\u00f3n]] in the [[Bay of Pigs]], where it overwhelmed a local revolutionary militia. Initially, [[Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez]] led the Cuban Army counter-offensive; later, Castro took personal control. As the invaders lost the strategic initiative, the international community found out about the invasion, and US President [[John F. Kennedy]] decided to withhold further air support.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13066561 |title=The 'perfect failure' of Cuba invasion |accessdate=17 May 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213152510/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13066561 |archivedate=13 February 2016 |df=dmy |work=BBC News |date=2011-04-14 |last1=Voss |first1=Michael}}</ref> The plan devised during Eisenhower's presidency had required involvement of both air and naval forces. Without air support, the invasion was being conducted with only one half of the forces that the CIA had deemed necessary. The invaders surrendered on April 20. Most of the invading counter-revolutionary troops were publicly interrogated and put into Cuban prisons. The invading force had been defeated within three days by Castro and the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]].\n\nThe invasion was a [[US foreign policy]] failure. The invasion's defeat solidified Castro's role as a national hero, and widened the political divide between the two formerly-allied countries. It also pushed Cuba closer to the Soviet Union, and those strengthened Soviet-Cuban relations would lead to the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1962.\n\n==Background==\nSince the middle of the 18th century, Cuba had been the crown jewel of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial empire]]. In the late 19th century, Cuban nationalist revolutionaries rebelled against Spanish dominance, resulting in three liberation wars: the [[Ten Years' War]] (1868\u20131878), the [[Little War (Cuba)|Little War]] (1879\u20131880) and the [[Cuban War of Independence]] (1895\u20131898). The United States government proclaimed war on the [[Spanish Empire]], resulting in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (1898). The US subsequently invaded the island and forced the Spanish army out. Of note, a special operations attempt to land a group of at least 375 Cuban soldiers on the island succeeded in the [[Battle of Tayacoba]] of the Spanish\u2013American War. On 20 May 1902, a new independent government proclaimed the foundation of the [[Republic of Cuba]], with US Military governor [[Leonard Wood]] handing over control to President [[Tom\u00e1s Estrada Palma]], a Cuban-born US citizen.<ref name=\"Gott 113\">[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. p. 113.</ref> Subsequently, large numbers of US settlers and businessmen arrived in Cuba, and by 1905, 60% of rural properties were owned by non-Cuban North Americans.<ref name=\"Gott 115\">[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. p. 115.</ref> Between 1906 and 1909, 5,000 US Marines were stationed across the island, and returned in 1912, 1917 and 1921 to intervene in internal affairs, sometimes at the behest of the Cuban government.<ref name=\"Gott 115-116\">[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 115\u201316.</ref>\n\n===Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution===\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Until Castro, the US was so overwhelmingly influential in Cuba that the American ambassador was the second most important man, sometimes even more important than the Cuban president.\n| source = \u2014 [[Earl E.

Batista canceled the planned presidential elections, and described his new system as \"disciplined democracy.\" Although Batista gained some popular support, many Cubans saw it as the establishment of a one-man dictatorship.<ref>[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. pp. 64\u201365.</ref><ref>[[#Qui93|Quirk 1993]]. pp. 37\u201339.</ref><ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 57\u201362.</ref><ref>[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. p. 146.</ref> Many opponents of the Batista regime took to armed rebellion in an attempt to oust the government, sparking the [[Cuban Revolution]].

Undertaking armed attacks against government forces, some set up guerrilla bases in Cuba's mountainous regions, leading to the six-year [[Escambray Rebellion]].

Critics, in particular from the U.S. press, argued that many of these did not meet the standards of a [[fair trial]], and condemned Cuba's new government as being more interested in vengeance than justice. Castro retaliated strongly against such accusations, proclaiming that \"revolutionary justice is not based on legal precepts, but on moral conviction.\" In a show of support for this \"revolutionary justice,\" he organized the first [[Havana]] trial to take place before a mass audience of 17,000 at the [[Estadio Latinoamericano|Sports Palace stadium]].

The anti-Castro effort depended on the success of these aircraft.  Although models such as the C-46 and C-54 were to be used for airdrops and bomb drops as well as infiltration and exfiltration, they were looking for an aircraft that could perform tactical strikes.  The two models that were going to be decided on were the Navy's AD-5 Skyraider or the Air Force's light bomber, the B-26.  The AD-5 was readily available and ready for the Navy to train pilots, and in a meeting among a special group in the office of the Deputy Director of the CIA, the AD-5 was approved and decided on.  After a cost benefit analysis, word was sent that the AD-5 plan would be abandoned and the B-26 would take its place.<ref>http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB355/bop-vol1-part1.pdf</ref>\n\n===Fleet sets sail (14 April)===\nUnder cover of darkness, the invasion fleet set sail from [[Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua]] and headed towards the Bay of Pigs on the night of 14 April.{{sfn|Quesada|2009|page=19}} After on-loading the attack planes in Norfolk Naval Base, and taking on prodigious quantities of food and supplies sufficient for the seven weeks at-sea to come, the crew knew from the hasty camouflage of the ship's and aircraft identifying numbers that a secret mission was on hand. The aircraft carrier group of the [[USS Essex (CV-9)|USS Essex]] had been at sea for nearly a month before the invasion; its crew was well aware of the impending battle. On route, Essex had made a night time stop at a Navy arms depot in Charleston, SC to load tactical nuclear weapons to be held ready during the cruise. The afternoon of the invasion, one accompanying destroyer rendezvoused with Essex to have a gun mount repaired and put back into action; the ship displayed numerous shell casings on deck from its shore bombardment actions.

The B-26s had been prepared by the CIA on behalf of Brigade 2506, and had been painted with the [[false flag]] markings of the FAR, the air force of the Cuban government. Each came armed with bombs, rockets, and machine guns. They had flown from [[Puerto Cabezas]] in [[Nicaragua]], and were crewed by exiled Cuban pilots and navigators of the self-styled ''Fuerza A\u00e9rea de Liberaci\u00f3n'' (FAL). The purpose of the action (code-named ''Operation Puma'') was reportedly to destroy most or all of the armed aircraft of the FAR in preparation for the main invasion. At Santiago, the two attackers destroyed a [[C-47]] transport, a [[PBY Catalina]] flying boat, two B-26s and a civilian [[DC-3]] plus various other civilian aircraft. At San Antonio, the three attackers destroyed three FAR B-26s, one Sea Fury and one T-33, and one attacker diverted to [[Cayman Islands|Grand Cayman]] due to low usable fuel.

Like the bomber groups, it carried false FAR markings and the same number 933 as painted on at least two of the others. Before departure, the cowling from one of the aircraft's two engines was removed by CIA personnel, fired upon, then re-installed to give the false appearance that the aircraft had taken ground fire at some point during its flight. At a safe distance north of Cuba, the pilot feathered the engine with the pre-installed bullet holes in the cowling, radioed a [[Mayday (distress signal)|mayday]] call, and requested immediate permission to land at Miami International airport.  He landed and taxied to the military area of the airport near an Air Force C-47 and was met by several government cars. The pilot was Mario Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, formerly of the FAEC (Cuban Air Force under Batista), and after landing, he masqueraded as 'Juan Garcia' and publicly claimed that three colleagues had also defected from the FAR.

U.S. Ambassador [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] denied any involvement in the first wave of air strikes, stating before the United Nations, \"These charges are totally false and I deny them categorically.\" Stevenson continued to promote a story of two Cuban planes that had reportedly defected to the United States, apparently unaware that they were in fact U.S. planes piloted by U.S.-backed Cuban pilots to promote a false story of defection.<ref>.\"Bay of Pigs Declassified.\" History Undercover.

Now it's stronger than ever\".<ref>Anderson (1997), p. 509</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Guevara answered a set of questions from [[Leo Huberman]] of ''[[Monthly Review]]'' following the invasion. In one reply, Guevara was asked to explain the growing number of Cuban [[counter-revolutionaries]] and defectors from the regime, to which he replied that the repelled invasion was the climax of counter-revolution, and that afterward such actions \"fell drastically to zero.\" Regarding the defections of some prominent figures within the Cuban government, Guevara remarked that this was because \"the socialist revolution left the opportunists, the ambitious, and the fearful far behind and now advances toward a new regime free of this class of vermin.\"<ref>[http://www.monthlyreview.org/961che.htm Huberman.

Rasenberger elaborated on the fact that almost every decision that was made by Kennedy following the Bay of Pigs had some correlation with the destruction of the Castro administration. Shortly after the invasion ended, Kennedy ordered the Pentagon to design secret operations to overthrow the Castro regime. Also, President Kennedy persuaded his brother Robert to set up a covert action against Castro which was known as \"Operation Mongoose.\" This clandestine operation included sabotage and assassination plots.\n\n==Later analysis==\n\n===Maxwell Taylor survey===\nOn 22 April 1961, President Kennedy asked General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]], Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]], Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]] and CIA Director Allen Dulles to form the Cuba Study Group, to report on lessons to learn from the failed operation.  General Taylor submitted the Board of Inquiry's report to President Kennedy on 13 June.  It attributed the defeat to lack of early realization of the impossibility of success by covert means, to inadequate aircraft, to limitations on armaments, pilots, and air attacks set to attempt [[plausible deniability]] \u2013 and, ultimately, to loss of important ships and lack of ammunition.<ref>Kornbluh 1998. p. 324.</ref>\n\nThe Taylor Commission was criticized, and bias implied.  Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy]] was included in the group, and the commission collectively was seen to be more preoccupied with deflecting blame from the White House than concerned with realizing the real depth of mistakes that promoted the failure in Cuba.\n\nJack Pfeiffer, who worked as a historian for the CIA until the mid-1980s, simplified his own view of the failed Bay of Pigs effort by quoting a statement which Ra\u00fal Castro, Fidel's brother, had made to a Mexican journalist in 1975:  \"Kennedy vacillated,\" Ra\u00fal Castro said.  \"If at that moment he had decided to invade us, he could have suffocated the island in a sea of blood, but he could have destroyed the revolution.  Lucky for us, he vacillated.\"<ref>Kornbluh, Peter. Volume IV and V. ''Top Secret CIA Official Story of the Bay of Pigs: Revelations.''

Conclusions were:<ref>Kornbluh 1998. p. 99.</ref>\n# The C.I.A. exceeded its capabilities in developing the project from guerrilla support to overt armed action without any plausible deniability.\n# Failure to realistically assess risks and to adequately communicate information and decisions internally and with other government principals.\n# Insufficient involvement of leaders of the exiles.\n# Failure to sufficiently organize internal resistance in Cuba.\n# Failure to competently collect and analyze intelligence about Cuban forces.\n# Poor internal management of communications and staff.\n# Insufficient employment of high-quality staff.\n# Insufficient Spanish-speakers, training facilities, and material resources.\n# Lack of stable policies and/or contingency plans.\n\nIn spite of vigorous rebuttals by CIA management of the findings, CIA Director [[Allen Dulles]], [[Deputy Director of Central Intelligence|CIA Deputy Director]] [[Charles Cabell]], and Deputy Director for Plans [[Richard M. Bissell, Jr.|Richard Bissell]] were all forced to resign by early 1962.<ref name=higgins/>\n\nIn later years, the CIA's behavior in the event became the prime example cited for the psychology paradigm known as [[groupthink]] syndrome.<ref name=wyden/>\n\nFurther study shows that among various components of groupthink analyzed by [[Irving Janis]], The Bay of Pigs Invasion followed the structural characteristics that led to an irrational decision making in foreign policy pushed by deficiency in impartial leadership.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=Paul't|title=Irving L.

A considerable amount of information presented before President Kennedy proved to be false in reality, such as the support of the Cuban people for Fidel Castro, making it difficult to assess the actual situation and the future of the operation. The absence of the initiative to explore other options of the debate led the participants to remain optimistic and rigid in their belief that the mission would succeed, being unknowingly biased in the group psychology of [[wishful thinking]] as well.\n\nIn mid-1960, CIA operative [[E. Howard Hunt]] had interviewed Cubans in Havana; in a 1997 interview with [[CNN]], he said, \"...all I could find was a lot of enthusiasm for Fidel Castro.\"<ref>{{cite news\n |url = http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/18/interviews/hunt/\n |title = Episode 18: Backyard\n |accessdate = 20 May 2010\n |last = Hunt\n |first = Howard\n |year = 1997\n |work = Cold War\n |publisher = CNN\n |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071106000444/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/18/interviews/hunt/ |archivedate = 6 November 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Invasion legacy in Cuba===\n[[File:Airplane in Museo Giron.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Sea Fury F 50 preserved at the Museo Giron, [[Cuba]] in 2006]]\nFor many Latin Americans, the Bay of Pigs Invasion served to reinforce the already widely held belief that the US could not be trusted. The invasion also illustrated that the US could be defeated, and thus, the failed invasion encouraged political groups across the Latin American region to find ways to undermine US influence.<ref>[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. p. 191.</ref>\n\nHistorians often attest the Bay of Pigs fiasco made Castro even more popular, adding nationalistic sentiments in support of his economic policies. Following the air attacks on Cuban airfields on 15 April, he declared the revolution \"[[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]]\".<ref name=kellnerp69/> After the invasion, he pursued closer relations with the Soviet Union, partly for protection, that helped pave the way for the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. Castro was then increasingly wary of further US intervention, and more open to Soviet suggestions of placing nuclear weapons on Cuba to ensure its security.\n\nIn March 2001, shortly before the 40th anniversary of the invasion, a conference took place in Havana, attended by about 60 American delegates.

Covertly financed and directed by the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]], the operation took place at the height of the [[Cold War]] and its failure led to major shifts in international relations between Cuba, the [[United States]], and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nIn 1952, American ally General [[Fulgencio Batista]] led a [[1952 Cuban coup d'\u00e9tat | coup]] against President [[Carlos Pr\u00edo Socarr\u00e1s|Carlos Prio]], and forced Prio into exile in Miami. Prio's exile inspired the creation of the [[26th July Movement]] by Castro. The Movement successfully completed the [[Cuban Revolution]] in December 1958. Castro nationalized American businesses\u2014including banks, oil refineries, and sugar and coffee plantations\u2014then severed Cuba's formerly-close relations with the United States and reached out to its Cold War rival, the Soviet Union. In response, US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] allocated $13.1 million to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in March 1960, for use against Castro. With the aid of Cuban counter-revolutionaries, the CIA proceeded to organize an invasion operation.\n\nAfter Castro's victory, Cuban exiles who had traveled to the US had formed the [[counter-revolutionary]] military unit [[Brigade 2506]]. The Brigade fronted the armed wing of the [[Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front|Democratic Revolutionary Front]] (DRF) and its purpose was to overthrow Castro's [[Politics of Cuba|increasingly-communist government]]. The CIA funded the Brigade, which also included some [[United States Armed Forces|US military]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-2134|title=Bay of Pigs Invasion and the Alabama Air National Guard {{!}} Encyclopedia of Alabama|website=Encyclopedia of Alabama|language=en|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref> personnel, and trained the unit in [[Guatemala]]. \n\nOver 1,400 paramilitaries, divided into five infantry battalions and one paratrooper battalion, assembled and launched from Guatemala and [[Nicaragua]] by boat on 17 April 1961. Two days earlier, eight CIA-supplied [[Douglas A-26 Invader|B-26]] bombers had attacked Cuban airfields and then returned to the US. On the night of 17 April, the main invasion force landed on the beach at [[Playa Gir\u00f3n]] in the [[Bay of Pigs]], where it overwhelmed a local revolutionary militia. Initially, [[Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez]] led the Cuban Army counter-offensive; later, Castro took personal control. As the invaders lost the strategic initiative, the international community found out about the invasion, and US President [[John F. Kennedy]] decided to withhold further air support.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13066561 |title=The 'perfect failure' of Cuba invasion |accessdate=17 May 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213152510/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13066561 |archivedate=13 February 2016 |df=dmy |work=BBC News |date=2011-04-14 |last1=Voss |first1=Michael}}</ref> The plan devised during Eisenhower's presidency had required involvement of both air and naval forces. Without air support, the invasion was being conducted with only one half of the forces that the CIA had deemed necessary. The invaders surrendered on April 20. Most of the invading counter-revolutionary troops were publicly interrogated and put into Cuban prisons. The invading force had been defeated within three days by Castro and the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]].\n\nThe invasion was a [[US foreign policy]] failure. The invasion's defeat solidified Castro's role as a national hero, and widened the political divide between the two formerly-allied countries. It also pushed Cuba closer to the Soviet Union, and those strengthened Soviet-Cuban relations would lead to the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1962.\n\n==Background==\nSince the middle of the 18th century, Cuba had been the crown jewel of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial empire]]. In the late 19th century, Cuban nationalist revolutionaries rebelled against Spanish dominance, resulting in three liberation wars: the [[Ten Years' War]] (1868\u20131878), the [[Little War (Cuba)|Little War]] (1879\u20131880) and the [[Cuban War of Independence]] (1895\u20131898). The United States government proclaimed war on the [[Spanish Empire]], resulting in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (1898). The US subsequently invaded the island and forced the Spanish army out. Of note, a special operations attempt to land a group of at least 375 Cuban soldiers on the island succeeded in the [[Battle of Tayacoba]] of the Spanish\u2013American War. On 20 May 1902, a new independent government proclaimed the foundation of the [[Republic of Cuba]], with US Military governor [[Leonard Wood]] handing over control to President [[Tom\u00e1s Estrada Palma]], a Cuban-born US citizen.<ref name=\"Gott 113\">[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. p. 113.</ref> Subsequently, large numbers of US settlers and businessmen arrived in Cuba, and by 1905, 60% of rural properties were owned by non-Cuban North Americans.<ref name=\"Gott 115\">[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. p. 115.</ref> Between 1906 and 1909, 5,000 US Marines were stationed across the island, and returned in 1912, 1917 and 1921 to intervene in internal affairs, sometimes at the behest of the Cuban government.<ref name=\"Gott 115-116\">[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. pp. 115\u201316.</ref>\n\n===Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution===\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Until Castro, the US was so overwhelmingly influential in Cuba that the American ambassador was the second most important man, sometimes even more important than the Cuban president.\n| source = \u2014 [[Earl E.

Batista canceled the planned presidential elections, and described his new system as \"disciplined democracy.\" Although Batista gained some popular support, many Cubans saw it as the establishment of a one-man dictatorship.<ref>[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. pp. 64\u201365.</ref><ref>[[#Qui93|Quirk 1993]]. pp. 37\u201339.</ref><ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 57\u201362.</ref><ref>[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. p. 146.</ref> Many opponents of the Batista regime took to armed rebellion in an attempt to oust the government, sparking the [[Cuban Revolution]]. One of these groups was the National Revolutionary Movement (''Movimiento Nacional Revolucionario'' \u2013 MNR), a militant organization containing largely middle-class members that had been founded by the Professor of Philosophy [[Rafael Garc\u00eda B\u00e1rcena]].<ref>[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. pp. 71\u201372.</ref><ref>[[#Qui93|Quirk 1993]]. p. 45.</ref><ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 72.</ref> Another was the [[Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil]] (DRE), which had been founded by the Federation of University Students (FEU) President [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Echevarr\u00eda]] (1932\u20131957).<ref>[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. pp. 122, 129\u201330.</ref><ref>[[#Qui93|Quirk 1993]]. pp. 102\u201304, 114, 116.</ref><ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. p. 109.</ref> However, the best known of these anti-Batista groups was the \"[[26th of July Movement]]\" (MR-26-7), founded by a lawyer named [[Fidel Castro]].

Undertaking armed attacks against government forces, some set up guerrilla bases in Cuba's mountainous regions, leading to the six-year [[Escambray Rebellion]].

Although he remained a moderating force and tried to prevent the mass reprisal killings of Batistanos advocated by many Cubans, Castro helped to set up trials of many figures involved in the old regime across the country, resulting in hundreds of executions. Critics, in particular from the U.S. press, argued that many of these did not meet the standards of a [[fair trial]], and condemned Cuba's new government as being more interested in vengeance than justice. Castro retaliated strongly against such accusations, proclaiming that \"revolutionary justice is not based on legal precepts, but on moral conviction.\" In a show of support for this \"revolutionary justice,\" he organized the first [[Havana]] trial to take place before a mass audience of 17,000 at the [[Estadio Latinoamericano|Sports Palace stadium]]. When a group of aviators accused of bombing a village was found not guilty, he ordered a retrial, in which they were instead found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.<ref>[[#Bou86|Bourne 1986]]. pp. 163, 167\u201369.</ref><ref>[[#Qui93|Quirk 1993]]. pp. 224\u201325, 228\u201330.</ref><ref>[[#Col03|Coltman 2003]]. pp. 147\u201349.</ref> On 11 March 1961, {{Interlanguage link|Jes\u00fas Carreras Zayas|lt=Jes\u00fas Carreras Zayas|es|Jes\u00fas Carreras Zayas|WD=}} and American [[William Alexander Morgan]] (a former Castro ally) were executed after a trial.<ref name=thomas>Thomas (1971)</ref><ref name=nsa />\n\n===Tensions with the United States===\nCastro's Cuban government ordered the country's oil refineries \u2013 then controlled by US corporations [[Esso]] and [[Standard Oil]] and Anglo-Dutch [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] \u2013 to process crude oil purchased from the [[Soviet Union]], but under pressure from the US government, these companies refused.

At an August 1960 meeting of the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) held in [[Costa Rica]], the [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]], [[Christian Herter]], publicly proclaimed that Castro's administration was \"following faithfully the [[Bolshevik Party|Bolshevik]] pattern\" by instituting a single-party political system, taking governmental control of [[trade union]]s, suppressing [[civil liberties]], and removing both the [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]]. He furthermore asserted that [[international communism]] was using Cuba as an \"operational base\" for spreading revolution in the western hemisphere, and called on other OAS members to condemn the Cuban government for its breach of [[human rights]].<ref>[[#Qui93|Quirk 1993]]. p. 329.</ref> In turn, Castro lambasted the treatment of black people and the working classes he had witnessed in [[New York City|New York]], which he ridiculed as that \"superfree, superdemocratic, superhumane, and supercivilized city.\" Proclaiming that the US poor were living \"in the bowels of the imperialist monster,\" he attacked the mainstream US media and accused it of being controlled by big business.<ref>[[#Qui93|Quirk 1993]]. p. 344.</ref> Superficially the US was trying to improve its relationship with [[Cuba]]. Several negotiations between representatives from Cuba and the US took place around this time. Repairing international financial relations was the focal point of these discussions.

Although models such as the C-46 and C-54 were to be used for airdrops and bomb drops as well as infiltration and exfiltration, they were looking for an aircraft that could perform tactical strikes.  The two models that were going to be decided on were the Navy's AD-5 Skyraider or the Air Force's light bomber, the B-26.  The AD-5 was readily available and ready for the Navy to train pilots, and in a meeting among a special group in the office of the Deputy Director of the CIA, the AD-5 was approved and decided on.  After a cost benefit analysis, word was sent that the AD-5 plan would be abandoned and the B-26 would take its place.<ref>http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB355/bop-vol1-part1.pdf</ref>\n\n===Fleet sets sail (14 April)===\nUnder cover of darkness, the invasion fleet set sail from [[Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua]] and headed towards the Bay of Pigs on the night of 14 April.{{sfn|Quesada|2009|page=19}} After on-loading the attack planes in Norfolk Naval Base, and taking on prodigious quantities of food and supplies sufficient for the seven weeks at-sea to come, the crew knew from the hasty camouflage of the ship's and aircraft identifying numbers that a secret mission was on hand.

On route, Essex had made a night time stop at a Navy arms depot in Charleston, SC to load tactical nuclear weapons to be held ready during the cruise. The afternoon of the invasion, one accompanying destroyer rendezvoused with Essex to have a gun mount repaired and put back into action; the ship displayed numerous shell casings on deck from its shore bombardment actions.

The B-26s had been prepared by the CIA on behalf of Brigade 2506, and had been painted with the [[false flag]] markings of the FAR, the air force of the Cuban government. Each came armed with bombs, rockets, and machine guns. They had flown from [[Puerto Cabezas]] in [[Nicaragua]], and were crewed by exiled Cuban pilots and navigators of the self-styled ''Fuerza A\u00e9rea de Liberaci\u00f3n'' (FAL). The purpose of the action (code-named ''Operation Puma'') was reportedly to destroy most or all of the armed aircraft of the FAR in preparation for the main invasion. At Santiago, the two attackers destroyed a [[C-47]] transport, a [[PBY Catalina]] flying boat, two B-26s and a civilian [[DC-3]] plus various other civilian aircraft. At San Antonio, the three attackers destroyed three FAR B-26s, one Sea Fury and one T-33, and one attacker diverted to [[Cayman Islands|Grand Cayman]] due to low usable fuel.

Like the bomber groups, it carried false FAR markings and the same number 933 as painted on at least two of the others. Before departure, the cowling from one of the aircraft's two engines was removed by CIA personnel, fired upon, then re-installed to give the false appearance that the aircraft had taken ground fire at some point during its flight. At a safe distance north of Cuba, the pilot feathered the engine with the pre-installed bullet holes in the cowling, radioed a [[Mayday (distress signal)|mayday]] call, and requested immediate permission to land at Miami International airport.  He landed and taxied to the military area of the airport near an Air Force C-47 and was met by several government cars. The pilot was Mario Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, formerly of the FAEC (Cuban Air Force under Batista), and after landing, he masqueraded as 'Juan Garcia' and publicly claimed that three colleagues had also defected from the FAR.

U.S. Ambassador [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] denied any involvement in the first wave of air strikes, stating before the United Nations, \"These charges are totally false and I deny them categorically.\" Stevenson continued to promote a story of two Cuban planes that had reportedly defected to the United States, apparently unaware that they were in fact U.S. planes piloted by U.S.-backed Cuban pilots to promote a false story of defection.<ref>.\"Bay of Pigs Declassified.\" History Undercover.

In one reply, Guevara was asked to explain the growing number of Cuban [[counter-revolutionaries]] and defectors from the regime, to which he replied that the repelled invasion was the climax of counter-revolution, and that afterward such actions \"fell drastically to zero.\" Regarding the defections of some prominent figures within the Cuban government, Guevara remarked that this was because \"the socialist revolution left the opportunists, the ambitious, and the fearful far behind and now advances toward a new regime free of this class of vermin.\"<ref>[http://www.monthlyreview.org/961che.htm Huberman.

Rasenberger elaborated on the fact that almost every decision that was made by Kennedy following the Bay of Pigs had some correlation with the destruction of the Castro administration. Shortly after the invasion ended, Kennedy ordered the Pentagon to design secret operations to overthrow the Castro regime. Also, President Kennedy persuaded his brother Robert to set up a covert action against Castro which was known as \"Operation Mongoose.\" This clandestine operation included sabotage and assassination plots.\n\n==Later analysis==\n\n===Maxwell Taylor survey===\nOn 22 April 1961, President Kennedy asked General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]], Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]], Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]] and CIA Director Allen Dulles to form the Cuba Study Group, to report on lessons to learn from the failed operation.  General Taylor submitted the Board of Inquiry's report to President Kennedy on 13 June.  It attributed the defeat to lack of early realization of the impossibility of success by covert means, to inadequate aircraft, to limitations on armaments, pilots, and air attacks set to attempt [[plausible deniability]] \u2013 and, ultimately, to loss of important ships and lack of ammunition.<ref>Kornbluh 1998. p. 324.</ref>\n\nThe Taylor Commission was criticized, and bias implied.  Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy]] was included in the group, and the commission collectively was seen to be more preoccupied with deflecting blame from the White House than concerned with realizing the real depth of mistakes that promoted the failure in Cuba.\n\nJack Pfeiffer, who worked as a historian for the CIA until the mid-1980s, simplified his own view of the failed Bay of Pigs effort by quoting a statement which Ra\u00fal Castro, Fidel's brother, had made to a Mexican journalist in 1975:  \"Kennedy vacillated,\" Ra\u00fal Castro said.  \"If at that moment he had decided to invade us, he could have suffocated the island in a sea of blood, but he could have destroyed the revolution.

Bissell, Jr.|Richard Bissell]] were all forced to resign by early 1962.<ref name=higgins/>\n\nIn later years, the CIA's behavior in the event became the prime example cited for the psychology paradigm known as [[groupthink]] syndrome.<ref name=wyden/>\n\nFurther study shows that among various components of groupthink analyzed by [[Irving Janis]], The Bay of Pigs Invasion followed the structural characteristics that led to an irrational decision making in foreign policy pushed by deficiency in impartial leadership.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=Paul't|title=Irving L.

A considerable amount of information presented before President Kennedy proved to be false in reality, such as the support of the Cuban people for Fidel Castro, making it difficult to assess the actual situation and the future of the operation. The absence of the initiative to explore other options of the debate led the participants to remain optimistic and rigid in their belief that the mission would succeed, being unknowingly biased in the group psychology of [[wishful thinking]] as well.\n\nIn mid-1960, CIA operative [[E. Howard Hunt]] had interviewed Cubans in Havana; in a 1997 interview with [[CNN]], he said, \"...all I could find was a lot of enthusiasm for Fidel Castro.\"<ref>{{cite news\n |url = http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/18/interviews/hunt/\n |title = Episode 18: Backyard\n |accessdate = 20 May 2010\n |last = Hunt\n |first = Howard\n |year = 1997\n |work = Cold War\n |publisher = CNN\n |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071106000444/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/18/interviews/hunt/ |archivedate = 6 November 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Invasion legacy in Cuba===\n[[File:Airplane in Museo Giron.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Sea Fury F 50 preserved at the Museo Giron, [[Cuba]] in 2006]]\nFor many Latin Americans, the Bay of Pigs Invasion served to reinforce the already widely held belief that the US could not be trusted. The invasion also illustrated that the US could be defeated, and thus, the failed invasion encouraged political groups across the Latin American region to find ways to undermine US influence.<ref>[[#Got04|Gott 2004]]. p. 191.</ref>\n\nHistorians often attest the Bay of Pigs fiasco made Castro even more popular, adding nationalistic sentiments in support of his economic policies. Following the air attacks on Cuban airfields on 15 April, he declared the revolution \"[[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]]\".<ref name=kellnerp69/> After the invasion, he pursued closer relations with the Soviet Union, partly for protection, that helped pave the way for the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. Castro was then increasingly wary of further US intervention, and more open to Soviet suggestions of placing nuclear weapons on Cuba to ensure its security.\n\nIn March 2001, shortly before the 40th anniversary of the invasion, a conference took place in Havana, attended by about 60 American delegates.
