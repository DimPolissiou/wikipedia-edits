The other operations are [[addition]], [[subtraction]], and [[multiplication]] (which can be viewed as the inverse of division). The [[division sign]] (<code>\u00f7</code>), a symbol consisting of a short horizontal line with a dot above and another dot below, is often used to indicate mathematical division. This usage, though widespread in [[anglophone countries]], is neither universal nor recommended: the [[ISO 80000-2]] standard for [[mathematical notation]] recommends only the [[Slash (punctuation)|solidus]] (<code>/</code>) or [[Fraction (mathematics)#Vocabulary|fraction bar]] for division, or the colon for [[ratio]]s; it says that this symbol \"should not be used\" for division.<ref>[[ISO 80000-2]], Section 9 \"Operations\", 2-9.6</ref>\n\nAt an elementary level the division of two [[natural number]]s is \u2013 among other [[Quotition and partition|possible interpretations]] \u2013 the process of calculating the number of times one number is contained within another one.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blake|first1=A.

In these enlarged [[number system]]s, division is the inverse operation to multiplication, that is {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''c'' / ''b''}} means {{math|''a'' \u00d7 ''b'' {{=}} ''c''}}, as long as {{math|''b''}} is not zero. If {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}, then this is a [[division by zero]], which is not defined.{{efn|Division by zero may be defined in some circumstances, either by extending the real numbers to the [[extended real number line]] or to the [[projectively extended real line]] or when occurring as limit of divisions by numbers tending to 0.

Those in which a Euclidean division (with remainder) is defined are called [[Euclidean domain]]s and include [[polynomial ring]]s in one [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] (which define multiplication and addition over single-variabled formulas). Those in which a division (with a single result) by all nonzero elements is defined are called [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[division ring]]s. In a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] the elements by which division is always possible are called the [[unit (ring theory)|units]] (for example, 1 and \u20131 in the ring of integers). Another generalization of division to algebraic structures is the [[quotient group]], in which the result of 'division' is a group rather than a number.\n\n==Introduction==\nThe simplest way of viewing division is in terms of [[quotition and partition]]: from the quotition perspective, {{math|20&nbsp;/&nbsp;5}} means the number of 5s that must be added to get&nbsp;20. In terms of partition, {{math|20&nbsp;\u00f7&nbsp;5}} means the size of each of 5 parts into which a set of size 20 is divided. For example, 20 apples divide into five groups of four apples, meaning that ''twenty divided by five is equal to four''. This is denoted as {{math|1=20 / 5 = 4}} or {{math|20 \u00f7 5 {{=}} 4}}, or {{math|1={{sfrac|20|5}} = 4}}.<ref name=\"mwdiv\">{{MathWorld|id=Division|title=Division}}</ref> What is being divided is called the ''dividend'', which is divided by the ''divisor'', and the result is called the ''quotient''. In the example, 20 is the dividend, 5 is the divisor, and 4 is the quotient.\n\nUnlike the other basic operations, when dividing natural numbers there is sometimes a [[remainder]] that will not go evenly into the dividend; for example, {{math|10 / 3}} (or {{math|10 \u00f7 3}}) leaves a remainder of 1, as 10 is not a multiple of 3. Sometimes this remainder is added to the quotient as a [[fractional part]], so {{math|10 / 3}} is equal to {{math|{{sfrac|3|1|3}}}} or {{math|3.33...}}, but in the context of [[integer]] division, where numbers have no fractional part, the remainder is kept separately (exceptionally, discarded or [[rounding|rounded]]).<ref name=\"mwintdiv\">{{MathWorld|id=IntegerDivision|title=Integer Division}}</ref> When the remainder is kept as a fraction, it leads to a [[rational number]]. The set of all rational numbers is created by every possible division using integers.

Specifically, division has the right-[[distributive property]] over addition and subtraction. That means\n: <math>\\frac{a + b}{c} = (a + b) / c = \\frac{a}{c} + \\frac{b}{c}.</math>\n\nThis is the same as [[multiplication]]: <math>(a + b) \\times c = a \\times c + b \\times c</math>.

An [[obelus]] used as a variant of the minus sign in an excerpt from an official Norwegian trading statement form called \u00abN\u00e6ringsoppgave 1\u00bb for the taxation year 2010.]]\nDivision is often shown in algebra and science by placing the ''dividend'' over the ''divisor'' with a horizontal line, also called a [[fraction bar]], between them. For example, \"''a'' divided by ''b\"'' can written as:\n:<math>\\frac ab</math>\n\nwhich can also be read out loud as \"divide ''a'' by ''b''\" or\"''a'' over ''b''\". A way to express division all on one line is to write the ''dividend'' (or numerator), then a [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]], then the ''divisor'' (or denominator), as follows:\n:<math>a/b</math>\n\nThis is the usual way of specifying division in most computer [[programming language]]s, since it can easily be typed as a simple sequence of [[ASCII]] characters. Some [[mathematical software]], such as [[MATLAB]] and [[GNU Octave]], allows the operands to be written in the reverse order by using the [[backslash]] as the division operator:\n:<math>b\\backslash a</math>\n\nA typographical variation halfway between these two forms uses a [[solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] (fraction slash) but elevates the dividend, and lowers the divisor:\n:<math>{}^{a}/{}_{b}</math>\n\nAny of these forms can be used to display a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]. A fraction is a division expression where both dividend and divisor are [[integer]]s (typically called the ''numerator'' and ''denominator''), and there is no implication that the division must be evaluated further. A second way to show division is to use the [[division sign]](\u00f7, also known as [[obelus]] though the term has additional meanings), common in arithmetic, in this manner:\n:<math>a \\div b</math>\n\nThis form is infrequent except in elementary arithmetic. [[ISO 80000-2]]-9.6 states it should not be used. This division sign is also used alone to represent the division operation itself, as for instance as a label on a key of a [[calculator]]. The obelus was introduced by Swiss mathematician [[Johann Rahn]] in 1659 in ''Teutsche Algebra''.<ref name=\"Cajori\">{{cite book|author=Cajori, Florian|title=A History of Mathematical Notations|url=https://archive.org/details/b29980343_0002|publisher=Open Court Pub.

Distributing the objects several at a time in each round of sharing to each portion leads to the idea of '[[Chunking (division)|chunking]]'{{snd}} a form of division where one repeatedly subtracts multiples of the divisor from the dividend itself. \n\nBy allowing one to subtract more multiples than what the partial remainder allows at a given stage, more flexible methods, such as the bidirectional variant of chunking, can be developed as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/long-division/|title=The Definitive Higher Math Guide to Long Division and Its Variants \u2013 for Integers|date=2019-02-24|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621042203/https://mathvault.ca/long-division/|archive-date=2019-06-21|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMore systematic and more efficient (but also more formalised, more rule-based, and more removed from an overall holistic picture of what division is achieving), a person who knows the [[multiplication tables]] can divide two integers with pencil and paper using the method of [[short division]], if the divisor is small, or [[long division]], if the divisor is larger. If the dividend has a [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] part (expressed as a [[decimal fraction]]), one can continue the algorithm past the ones place as far as desired. If the divisor has a fractional part, one can restate the problem by moving the decimal to the right in both numbers until the divisor has no fraction.\n\nA person can calculate division with an [[abacus]] by repeatedly placing the dividend on the abacus, and then subtracting the divisor the offset of each digit in the result, counting the number of divisions possible at each offset.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://owlcation.com/stem/How-to-do-Division-on-the-Abacus-in-Easy-Steps|title=How to Do Division on the Abacus in Easy Steps|website=Owlcation|language=en|access-date=2019-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624204231/https://owlcation.com/stem/How-to-do-Division-on-the-Abacus-in-Easy-Steps|archive-date=2019-06-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA person can use [[logarithm tables]] to divide two numbers, by subtracting the two numbers' logarithms, then looking up the antilogarithm of the result.\n\nA person can calculate division with a [[slide rule]] by aligning the divisor on the C scale with the dividend on the D scale. The quotient can be found on the D scale where it is aligned with the left index on the C scale. The user is responsible, however, for mentally keeping track of the decimal point.\n\n===By computer or with computer assistance===\nModern computers compute division by methods that are faster than long division, with the more efficient ones relying on approximation techniques from numerical analysis. For [[division with remainder]], see [[Division algorithm]].\n\nIn [[modular arithmetic]] (modulo a prime number) and for [[real numbers]], nonzero numbers have a [[modular multiplicative inverse|multiplicative inverse]]. In these cases, a division by {{mvar|x}} may be computed as the product by the multiplicative inverse of {{mvar|x}}. This approach is often associated with the faster methods in computer arithmetic.\n\n==Division in different contexts==\n=== Euclidean division ===\n{{main|Euclidean division}}\nThe Euclidean division is the mathematical formulation of the outcome of the usual process of division of integers. It asserts that, given two integers, ''a'', the ''dividend'', and ''b'', the ''divisor'', such that ''b'' \u2260 0, there are [[Uniqueness quantification|unique]] integers ''q'', the ''quotient'', and ''r'', the remainder,  such that ''a'' = ''bq'' + ''r'' and 0 \u2264 ''r'' < {{abs|''b''}}, where {{abs|''b''}} denotes the [[absolute value]] of ''b''.\n\n=== Of integers ===\nIntegers are not [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under division. Apart from division by zero being undefined, the quotient is not an integer unless the dividend is an integer multiple of the divisor. For example, 26 cannot be divided by 11 to give an integer. Such a case uses one of five approaches:\n# Say that 26 cannot be divided by 11; division becomes a [[partial function]].\n# Give an approximate answer as a [[decimal fraction]] or a [[mixed number]], so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} \\simeq 2.36</math> or <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} \\simeq 2 \\tfrac {36}{100}.</math> This is the approach usually taken in [[numerical computation]].\n# Give the answer as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] representing a [[rational number]], so the result of the division of 26 by 11 is <math>\\tfrac{26}{11}.</math> But, usually, the resulting fraction should be simplified: the result of the division of 52 by 22 is also <math>\\tfrac{26}{11}</math>. This simplification may be done by factoring out the [[greatest common divisor]].\n# Give the answer as an integer ''[[quotient]]'' and a ''[[remainder]]'', so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} = 2 \\mbox{ remainder } 4.</math> To make the distinction with the previous case, this division, with two integers as result, is sometimes called ''[[Euclidean division]]'', because it is the basis of the [[Euclidean algorithm]].\n# Give the integer quotient as the answer, so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} = 2.</math> This is sometimes called ''integer division''.\nDividing integers in a [[computer program]] requires special care. Some [[programming language]]s, such as [[C (programming language)|C]], treat integer division as in case 5 above, so the answer is an integer. Other languages, such as [[MATLAB]] and every [[computer algebra system]] return a rational number as the answer, as in case 3 above. These languages also provide functions to get the results of the other cases, either directly or from the result of case 3.\n\nNames and symbols used for integer division include div, /, \\, and %. Definitions vary regarding integer division when the dividend or the divisor is negative: rounding may be toward zero (so called T-division) or toward [[Extended real number line|\u2212\u221e]] (F-division); rarer styles can occur \u2013 see [[Modulo operation]] for the details.\n\n[[Divisibility rule]]s can sometimes be used to quickly determine whether one integer divides exactly into another.\n\n=== Of rational numbers ===\nThe result of dividing two [[rational number]]s is another rational number when the divisor is not 0. The division of two rational numbers ''p''/''q'' and ''r''/''s'' can be computed as\n:<math>{p/q \\over r/s} = {p \\over q} \\times {s \\over r} = {ps \\over qr}.</math>\n\nAll four quantities are integers, and only ''p'' may be 0. This definition ensures that division is the inverse operation of [[multiplication]].\n\n=== Of real numbers ===\nDivision of two [[real number]]s results in another real number (when the divisor is nonzero). It is defined such that ''a''/''b'' = ''c'' if and only if ''a'' = ''cb'' and ''b'' \u2260 0.\n\n=== Of complex numbers ===\nDividing two [[complex number]]s (when the divisor is nonzero) results in another complex number, which is found using the conjugate of the denominator:\n:<math>{p+iq \\over r+is} = {(p+iq)(r-is) \\over (r+is)(r-is)} = {pr+qs + i(qr-ps) \\over r^2+s^2} = {pr+qs \\over r^2+s^2} + i{qr-ps \\over r^2+s^2}.</math>\n\nThis process of multiplying and dividing by <math>r-is</math> is called 'realisation' or (by analogy) [[Rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalisation]]. All four quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', ''s'' are real numbers, and ''r'' and ''s'' may not both be 0.\n\nDivision for complex numbers expressed in polar form is simpler than the definition above:\n:<math>{p e^{iq} \\over r e^{is}} = {p e^{iq} e^{-is} \\over r e^{is} e^{-is}} = {p \\over r}e^{i(q - s)}. </math>\n\nAgain all four quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', ''s'' are real numbers, and ''r'' may not be 0.\n\n=== Of polynomials ===\nOne can define the division operation for [[polynomial]]s in one variable over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. Then, as in the case of integers, one has a remainder. See [[Euclidean division of polynomials]], and, for hand-written computation, [[polynomial long division]] or [[synthetic division]].\n\n=== Of matrices ===\nOne can define a division operation for matrices. The usual way to do this is to define {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}}, where {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} denotes the [[inverse matrix|inverse]] of ''B'', but it is far more common to write out {{nowrap|''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} explicitly to avoid confusion. An [[elementwise division]] can also be defined in terms of the [[Hadamard product (matrices)|Hadamard product]].\n\n==== Left and right division ====\nBecause [[matrix multiplication]] is not [[commutative]], one can also define a [[left division]] or so-called ''backslash-division'' as {{nowrap|1=''A'' \\ ''B'' = ''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>''B''}}. For this to be well defined, {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} need not exist, however {{nowrap|''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} does need to exist. To avoid confusion, division as defined by {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is sometimes called ''right division'' or ''slash-division'' in this context.\n\nNote that with left and right division defined this way, {{nowrap|''A'' / (''BC'')}} is in general not the same as {{nowrap|(''A'' / ''B'') / ''C''}}, nor is {{nowrap|(''AB'') \\ ''C''}} the same as {{nowrap|''A'' \\ (''B'' \\ ''C'')}}. However, it holds that {{nowrap|1=''A'' / (''BC'') = (''A'' / ''C'') / ''B''}} and {{nowrap|1=(''AB'') \\ ''C'' = ''B'' \\ (''A'' \\ ''C'')}}.\n\n==== Pseudoinverse ====\nTo avoid problems when {{nowrap|''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} and/or {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} do not exist, division can also be defined as multiplication by the [[Generalized inverse|pseudoinverse]]. That is, {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>+</sup>}} and {{nowrap|1=''A'' \\ ''B'' = ''A''<sup>+</sup>''B''}}, where {{nowrap|''A''<sup>+</sup>}} and {{nowrap|''B''<sup>+</sup>}} denote the pseudoinverses of ''A'' and ''B''.\n\n=== Abstract algebra ===\nIn [[abstract algebra]], given a [[Magma (algebra)|magma]] with binary operation \u2217 (which could nominally be termed multiplication), left division of ''b'' by ''a'' (written {{nowrap|''a'' \\ ''b''}}) is typically defined as the solution ''x'' to the equation {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2217 ''x'' = ''b''}}, if this exists and is unique.  Similarly, right division of ''b'' by ''a'' (written {{nowrap|''b'' / ''a''}}) is the solution ''y'' to the equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' \u2217 ''a'' = ''b''}}.  Division in this sense does not require \u2217 to have any particular properties (such as commutativity, associativity, or an identity element).\n\n\"Division\" in the sense of \"cancellation\" can be done in any magma by an element with the [[cancellation property]].  Examples include [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] algebras and [[quaternion]] algebras.  A [[quasigroup]] is a structure in which division is always possible, even without an identity element and hence inverses.  In an [[integral domain]], where not every element need have an inverse, ''division'' by a cancellative element ''a'' can still be performed on elements of the form ''ab'' or ''ca'' by left or right cancellation, respectively.  If a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] is finite and every nonzero element is cancellative, then by an application of the [[pigeonhole principle]], every nonzero element of the ring is invertible, and ''division'' by any nonzero element is possible. To learn about when ''algebras'' (in the technical sense) have a division operation, refer to the page on [[division algebra]]s. In particular [[Bott periodicity]] can be used to show that any [[real number|real]] [[normed division algebra]] must be [[isomorphic]] to either the real numbers '''R''', the [[complex number]]s '''C''', the [[quaternion]]s '''H''', or the [[octonion]]s '''O'''.\n<!-- Left vs right, definition of quasigroup, relationship to inverse elements in presence of associativity, examples: groups, octonions -->\n\n=== Calculus ===\nThe [[derivative]] of the quotient of two functions is given by the [[quotient rule]]:\n:<math>{\\left(\\frac fg\\right)}' = \\frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}.</math>\n\n== Division by zero ==\n{{main|Division by zero}}\nDivision of any number by [[zero]] in most mathematical systems is undefined, because zero multiplied by any finite number always results in a [[multiplication|product]] of zero.<ref>http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisionbyZero.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023234325/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisionbyZero.html |date=2018-10-23 }} Retrieved October 23 2018</ref> Entry of such an expression into most [[calculator]]s produces an error message.

In these enlarged [[number system]]s, division is the inverse operation to multiplication, that is {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''c'' / ''b''}} means {{math|''a'' \u00d7 ''b'' {{=}} ''c''}}, as long as {{math|''b''}} is not zero.

Those in which a Euclidean division (with remainder) is defined are called [[Euclidean domain]]s and include [[polynomial ring]]s in one [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] (which define multiplication and addition over single-variabled formulas). Those in which a division (with a single result) by all nonzero elements is defined are called [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[division ring]]s. In a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] the elements by which division is always possible are called the [[unit (ring theory)|units]] (for example, 1 and \u20131 in the ring of integers). Another generalization of division to algebraic structures is the [[quotient group]], in which the result of 'division' is a group rather than a number.\n\n==Introduction==\nThe simplest way of viewing division is in terms of [[quotition and partition]]: from the quotition perspective, {{math|20&nbsp;/&nbsp;5}} means the number of 5s that must be added to get&nbsp;20. In terms of partition, {{math|20&nbsp;\u00f7&nbsp;5}} means the size of each of 5 parts into which a set of size 20 is divided. For example, 20 apples divide into four groups of five apples, meaning that ''twenty divided by five is equal to four''. This is denoted as {{math|1=20 / 5 = 4}} or {{math|20 \u00f7 5 {{=}} 4}}, or {{math|1={{sfrac|20|5}} = 4}}.<ref name=\"mwdiv\">{{MathWorld|id=Division|title=Division}}</ref> What is being divided is called the ''dividend'', which is divided by the ''divisor'', and the result is called the ''quotient''. In the example, 20 is the dividend, 5 is the divisor, and 4 is the quotient.\n\nUnlike the other basic operations, when dividing natural numbers there is sometimes a [[remainder]] that will not go evenly into the dividend; for example, {{math|10 / 3}} (or {{math|10 \u00f7 3}}) leaves a remainder of 1, as 10 is not a multiple of 3. Sometimes this remainder is added to the quotient as a [[fractional part]], so {{math|10 / 3}} is equal to {{math|{{sfrac|3|1|3}}}} or {{math|3.33...}}, but in the context of [[integer]] division, where numbers have no fractional part, the remainder is kept separately (exceptionally, discarded or [[rounding|rounded]]).<ref name=\"mwintdiv\">{{MathWorld|id=IntegerDivision|title=Integer Division}}</ref> When the remainder is kept as a fraction, it leads to a [[rational number]].

An [[obelus]] used as a variant of the minus sign in an excerpt from an official Norwegian trading statement form called \u00abN\u00e6ringsoppgave 1\u00bb for the taxation year 2010.]]\nDivision is often shown in algebra and science by placing the ''dividend'' over the ''divisor'' with a horizontal line, also called a [[fraction bar]], between them. For example, \"''a'' divided by ''b\"'' can written as:\n:<math>\\frac ab</math>\n\nwhich can also be read out loud as \"divide ''a'' by ''b''\" or\"''a'' over ''b''\". A way to express division all on one line is to write the ''dividend'' (or numerator), then a [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]], then the ''divisor'' (or denominator), as follows:\n:<math>a/b</math>\n\nThis is the usual way of specifying division in most computer [[programming language]]s, since it can easily be typed as a simple sequence of [[ASCII]] characters. Some [[mathematical software]], such as [[MATLAB]] and [[GNU Octave]], allows the operands to be written in the reverse order by using the [[backslash]] as the division operator:\n:<math>b\\backslash a</math>\n\nA typographical variation halfway between these two forms uses a [[solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] (fraction slash) but elevates the dividend, and lowers the divisor:\n:<math>{}^{a}/{}_{b}</math>\n\nAny of these forms can be used to display a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]. A fraction is a division expression where both dividend and divisor are [[integer]]s (typically called the ''numerator'' and ''denominator''), and there is no implication that the division must be evaluated further. A second way to show division is to use the [[division sign]](\u00f7, also known as [[obelus]] though the term has additional meanings), common in arithmetic, in this manner:\n:<math>a \\div b</math>\n\nThis form is infrequent except in elementary arithmetic. [[ISO 80000-2]]-9.6 states it should not be used. This division sign is also used alone to represent the division operation itself, as for instance as a label on a key of a [[calculator]]. The obelus was introduced by Swiss mathematician [[Johann Rahn]] in 1659 in ''Teutsche Algebra''.<ref name=\"Cajori\">{{cite book|author=Cajori, Florian|title=A History of Mathematical Notations|url=https://archive.org/details/b29980343_0002|publisher=Open Court Pub.

Distributing the objects several at a time in each round of sharing to each portion leads to the idea of '[[Chunking (division)|chunking]]'{{snd}} a form of division where one repeatedly subtracts multiples of the divisor from the dividend itself. \n\nBy allowing one to subtract more multiples than what the partial remainder allows at a given stage, more flexible methods, such as the bidirectional variant of chunking, can be developed as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/long-division/|title=The Definitive Higher Math Guide to Long Division and Its Variants \u2013 for Integers|date=2019-02-24|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621042203/https://mathvault.ca/long-division/|archive-date=2019-06-21|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMore systematic and more efficient (but also more formalised, more rule-based, and more removed from an overall holistic picture of what division is achieving), a person who knows the [[multiplication tables]] can divide two integers with pencil and paper using the method of [[short division]], if the divisor is small, or [[long division]], if the divisor is larger. If the dividend has a [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] part (expressed as a [[decimal fraction]]), one can continue the algorithm past the ones place as far as desired. If the divisor has a fractional part, one can restate the problem by moving the decimal to the right in both numbers until the divisor has no fraction.\n\nA person can calculate division with an [[abacus]] by repeatedly placing the dividend on the abacus, and then subtracting the divisor the offset of each digit in the result, counting the number of divisions possible at each offset.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://owlcation.com/stem/How-to-do-Division-on-the-Abacus-in-Easy-Steps|title=How to Do Division on the Abacus in Easy Steps|website=Owlcation|language=en|access-date=2019-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624204231/https://owlcation.com/stem/How-to-do-Division-on-the-Abacus-in-Easy-Steps|archive-date=2019-06-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA person can use [[logarithm tables]] to divide two numbers, by subtracting the two numbers' logarithms, then looking up the antilogarithm of the result.\n\nA person can calculate division with a [[slide rule]] by aligning the divisor on the C scale with the dividend on the D scale. The quotient can be found on the D scale where it is aligned with the left index on the C scale. The user is responsible, however, for mentally keeping track of the decimal point.\n\n===By computer or with computer assistance===\nModern computers compute division by methods that are faster than long division, with the more efficient ones relying on approximation techniques from numerical analysis. For [[division with remainder]], see [[Division algorithm]].\n\nIn [[modular arithmetic]] (modulo a prime number) and for [[real numbers]], nonzero numbers have a [[modular multiplicative inverse|multiplicative inverse]]. In these cases, a division by {{mvar|x}} may be computed as the product by the multiplicative inverse of {{mvar|x}}. This approach is often associated with the faster methods in computer arithmetic.\n\n==Division in different contexts==\n=== Euclidean division ===\n{{main|Euclidean division}}\nThe Euclidean division is the mathematical formulation of the outcome of the usual process of division of integers. It asserts that, given two integers, ''a'', the ''dividend'', and ''b'', the ''divisor'', such that ''b'' \u2260 0, there are [[Uniqueness quantification|unique]] integers ''q'', the ''quotient'', and ''r'', the remainder,  such that ''a'' = ''bq'' + ''r'' and 0 \u2264 ''r'' < {{abs|''b''}}, where {{abs|''b''}} denotes the [[absolute value]] of ''b''.\n\n=== Of integers ===\nIntegers are not [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under division. Apart from division by zero being undefined, the quotient is not an integer unless the dividend is an integer multiple of the divisor. For example, 26 cannot be divided by 11 to give an integer. Such a case uses one of five approaches:\n# Say that 26 cannot be divided by 11; division becomes a [[partial function]].\n# Give an approximate answer as a [[decimal fraction]] or a [[mixed number]], so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} \\simeq 2.36</math> or <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} \\simeq 2 \\tfrac {36}{100}.</math> This is the approach usually taken in [[numerical computation]].\n# Give the answer as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] representing a [[rational number]], so the result of the division of 26 by 11 is <math>\\tfrac{26}{11}.</math> But, usually, the resulting fraction should be simplified: the result of the division of 52 by 22 is also <math>\\tfrac{26}{11}</math>. This simplification may be done by factoring out the [[greatest common divisor]].\n# Give the answer as an integer ''[[quotient]]'' and a ''[[remainder]]'', so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} = 2 \\mbox{ remainder } 4.</math> To make the distinction with the previous case, this division, with two integers as result, is sometimes called ''[[Euclidean division]]'', because it is the basis of the [[Euclidean algorithm]].\n# Give the integer quotient as the answer, so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} = 2.</math> This is sometimes called ''integer division''.\nDividing integers in a [[computer program]] requires special care. Some [[programming language]]s, such as [[C (programming language)|C]], treat integer division as in case 5 above, so the answer is an integer. Other languages, such as [[MATLAB]] and every [[computer algebra system]] return a rational number as the answer, as in case 3 above. These languages also provide functions to get the results of the other cases, either directly or from the result of case 3.\n\nNames and symbols used for integer division include div, /, \\, and %. Definitions vary regarding integer division when the dividend or the divisor is negative: rounding may be toward zero (so called T-division) or toward [[Extended real number line|\u2212\u221e]] (F-division); rarer styles can occur \u2013 see [[Modulo operation]] for the details.\n\n[[Divisibility rule]]s can sometimes be used to quickly determine whether one integer divides exactly into another.\n\n=== Of rational numbers ===\nThe result of dividing two [[rational number]]s is another rational number when the divisor is not 0. The division of two rational numbers ''p''/''q'' and ''r''/''s'' can be computed as\n:<math>{p/q \\over r/s} = {p \\over q} \\times {s \\over r} = {ps \\over qr}.</math>\n\nAll four quantities are integers, and only ''p'' may be 0. This definition ensures that division is the inverse operation of [[multiplication]].\n\n=== Of real numbers ===\nDivision of two [[real number]]s results in another real number (when the divisor is nonzero). It is defined such that ''a''/''b'' = ''c'' if and only if ''a'' = ''cb'' and ''b'' \u2260 0.\n\n=== Of complex numbers ===\nDividing two [[complex number]]s (when the divisor is nonzero) results in another complex number, which is found using the conjugate of the denominator:\n:<math>{p+iq \\over r+is} = {(p+iq)(r-is) \\over (r+is)(r-is)} = {pr+qs + i(qr-ps) \\over r^2+s^2} = {pr+qs \\over r^2+s^2} + i{qr-ps \\over r^2+s^2}.</math>\n\nThis process of multiplying and dividing by <math>r-is</math> is called 'realisation' or (by analogy) [[Rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalisation]]. All four quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', ''s'' are real numbers, and ''r'' and ''s'' may not both be 0.\n\nDivision for complex numbers expressed in polar form is simpler than the definition above:\n:<math>{p e^{iq} \\over r e^{is}} = {p e^{iq} e^{-is} \\over r e^{is} e^{-is}} = {p \\over r}e^{i(q - s)}. </math>\n\nAgain all four quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', ''s'' are real numbers, and ''r'' may not be 0.\n\n=== Of polynomials ===\nOne can define the division operation for [[polynomial]]s in one variable over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. Then, as in the case of integers, one has a remainder. See [[Euclidean division of polynomials]], and, for hand-written computation, [[polynomial long division]] or [[synthetic division]].\n\n=== Of matrices ===\nOne can define a division operation for matrices. The usual way to do this is to define {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}}, where {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} denotes the [[inverse matrix|inverse]] of ''B'', but it is far more common to write out {{nowrap|''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} explicitly to avoid confusion. An [[elementwise division]] can also be defined in terms of the [[Hadamard product (matrices)|Hadamard product]].\n\n==== Left and right division ====\nBecause [[matrix multiplication]] is not [[commutative]], one can also define a [[left division]] or so-called ''backslash-division'' as {{nowrap|1=''A'' \\ ''B'' = ''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>''B''}}. For this to be well defined, {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} need not exist, however {{nowrap|''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} does need to exist. To avoid confusion, division as defined by {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is sometimes called ''right division'' or ''slash-division'' in this context.\n\nNote that with left and right division defined this way, {{nowrap|''A'' / (''BC'')}} is in general not the same as {{nowrap|(''A'' / ''B'') / ''C''}}, nor is {{nowrap|(''AB'') \\ ''C''}} the same as {{nowrap|''A'' \\ (''B'' \\ ''C'')}}. However, it holds that {{nowrap|1=''A'' / (''BC'') = (''A'' / ''C'') / ''B''}} and {{nowrap|1=(''AB'') \\ ''C'' = ''B'' \\ (''A'' \\ ''C'')}}.\n\n==== Pseudoinverse ====\nTo avoid problems when {{nowrap|''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} and/or {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} do not exist, division can also be defined as multiplication by the [[Generalized inverse|pseudoinverse]]. That is, {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>+</sup>}} and {{nowrap|1=''A'' \\ ''B'' = ''A''<sup>+</sup>''B''}}, where {{nowrap|''A''<sup>+</sup>}} and {{nowrap|''B''<sup>+</sup>}} denote the pseudoinverses of ''A'' and ''B''.\n\n=== Abstract algebra ===\nIn [[abstract algebra]], given a [[Magma (algebra)|magma]] with binary operation \u2217 (which could nominally be termed multiplication), left division of ''b'' by ''a'' (written {{nowrap|''a'' \\ ''b''}}) is typically defined as the solution ''x'' to the equation {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2217 ''x'' = ''b''}}, if this exists and is unique.  Similarly, right division of ''b'' by ''a'' (written {{nowrap|''b'' / ''a''}}) is the solution ''y'' to the equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' \u2217 ''a'' = ''b''}}.  Division in this sense does not require \u2217 to have any particular properties (such as commutativity, associativity, or an identity element).\n\n\"Division\" in the sense of \"cancellation\" can be done in any magma by an element with the [[cancellation property]].  Examples include [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] algebras and [[quaternion]] algebras.  A [[quasigroup]] is a structure in which division is always possible, even without an identity element and hence inverses.  In an [[integral domain]], where not every element need have an inverse, ''division'' by a cancellative element ''a'' can still be performed on elements of the form ''ab'' or ''ca'' by left or right cancellation, respectively.  If a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] is finite and every nonzero element is cancellative, then by an application of the [[pigeonhole principle]], every nonzero element of the ring is invertible, and ''division'' by any nonzero element is possible. To learn about when ''algebras'' (in the technical sense) have a division operation, refer to the page on [[division algebra]]s. In particular [[Bott periodicity]] can be used to show that any [[real number|real]] [[normed division algebra]] must be [[isomorphic]] to either the real numbers '''R''', the [[complex number]]s '''C''', the [[quaternion]]s '''H''', or the [[octonion]]s '''O'''.\n<!-- Left vs right, definition of quasigroup, relationship to inverse elements in presence of associativity, examples: groups, octonions -->\n\n=== Calculus ===\nThe [[derivative]] of the quotient of two functions is given by the [[quotient rule]]:\n:<math>{\\left(\\frac fg\\right)}' = \\frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}.</math>\n\n== Division by zero ==\n{{main|Division by zero}}\nDivision of any number by [[zero]] in most mathematical systems is undefined, because zero multiplied by any finite number always results in a [[multiplication|product]] of zero.<ref>http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisionbyZero.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023234325/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisionbyZero.html |date=2018-10-23 }} Retrieved October 23 2018</ref> Entry of such an expression into most [[calculator]]s produces an error message.

These narratives provided an explanation as to why other people groups exist who are not affiliated with their tribe.  Moreover, distinctions made between the creation of foreign people groups and the tribe or ethnic group to which the creation myth pertains served to reinforce tribal or ethnic unity, the need to exercise wariness and caution when dealing with outsiders, or the unique nature of the relationship between that tribe and the deities of their religious system.\n\nAn example may be found in the creation myth of the [[Asmat people]], a [[hunter-gatherer]] tribe situated along the south-western coast of [[New Guinea]].  This creation myth asserts that the Asmat themselves came into being when a deity placed carved wooden statues in a ceremonial house and began to beat a drum.  The statues became living humans and began to dance.  Some time later, a great crocodile attempted to attack this ceremonial house, but was defeated by the power of the deity.  The crocodile was cut into several pieces and these were tossed in different directions.  Each piece became one of the foreign tribes known to the Asmat.<ref>Feder, Kenneth L.; Michael Alan Park, ''Human Antiquity:  An Introduction to Physical Anthropology and Archaeology,'' Mayfield Publishing Company, 1989, pp. 3-4.</ref>\n\nThe idea is also found in some ancient Greek and Roman literature. For example, the Roman Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] in his ''Letter to a Priest'' wrote that he believed Zeus made multiple creations of man and women.<ref>Julian, ''Letter to a Priest'', trans. WC Wright, ''The Works of the Emperor Julian'', 3 vols. LCL, Cambridge, Mass., 1913-23.</ref> In his ''Against the Galilaens'' Julian presented his reasoning for this belief. Julian had noticed that the [[Germanics]] and [[Scythians]] (northern nations) were different in their bodies (i.e. complexion) to the [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]]. He therefore could not imagine such difference in physical attributes as having originated from common ancestry, and so maintained separate creations for different races.\n\nIn early classical and medieval geography the idea of polygenism surfaced because of the suggested possibility of there being inhabitants of the [[antipodes]] ([[Antichthones]]). These inhabitants were considered by some to have separate origins because of their geographical extremity.<ref>Flint, Valeria, ''Monsters and the Antipodes in the Early Middle Ages and Enlightenment'', Viator, Vol. 15, 1984, pp. 65-80.</ref>\n\nThe [[religion]] of the [[Ainu people]] claims that the ancestors of the Ainu people arrived on Earth from the skies separate from the other races. See [[Ainu creation myth]].\n\n==Main beliefs==\n\nTraditionally, most Jews, Christians and Muslims have embraced [[monogenism]] in the form that all modern humans ultimately are descended from a single mating pair, named [[Adam and Eve]].  In this context, polygenism described all alternative explanations for the origin of humankind that involved more than two individual \"first people\".  This definition of polygenism is still employed among some [[Creationists]] and within the Roman Catholic Church (see ''[[Humani generis]]'').\n\nWith the development of the evolutionary paradigm of human origins, it has become widely recognized within the scientific community that at no point did there exist a single \"first man\" and a single \"first woman\" who constituted the first true humans and to whom all lineages of modern humans ultimately converge.  If Adam and Eve ever existed as distinct historical persons, they were members of a much larger population of the same species.<ref>Tenesa, P. Navarro, B. J. Hayes et al. \"Recent Human Effective Population Size Estimated from Linkage Disequilibrium,\" ''Genome Research'' 17 (2007), pp. 520\u20136</ref>  However, a common scientific explanation of human origins asserts that the population directly ancestral to all modern humans remained united as a single population by constant [[gene flow]].  Therefore, on the level of the entire human population, this explanation of human origin is classified as monogenism.  All modern humans share the same origin from this single ancestral population.\n\nModern polygenists do not accept either theological or scientific monogenism.  They believe that the variation among human racial types cannot be accounted for by monogenism or by evolutionary processes occurring since the proposed [[recent African origin of modern humans]].  Polygenists reject the argument that human races must belong to a single species because they can interbreed. There are several polygenist hypotheses, including biblical creationist polygenism and polygenist evolution.<ref>David N. Livingstone, Adam's ancestors: race, religion, and the politics of human origins, 2008</ref><ref>John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005</ref>\n\n==The Bible==\nTo make polygenism compatible with the Biblical account in the early chapters of the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'', some argument is needed to the effect that what is in the Bible is incomplete. Three standard positions are:\n\n*[[Pre-Adamism]];\n*Co-Adamism;<ref>For pre-Adamism and co-Adamism, see Livingstone, David, ''The Preadamite Theory and the Marriage of Science and Religion'', Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, New Series, Vol. 82, No. 3, 1992, p. 63.</ref>\n*incompleteness of the ''[[Table of Nations]]'' in Genesis 10.\n\nIn Christian terms, polygenesis remained an uncommon [[exegesis|Biblical interpretation]] until the mid-19th century, and was largely considered [[heresy|heretical]]; however, it has been pointed out by some modern scholars that, while Pre-Adamism was strongly rejected by most and deemed heretical, Co-Adamism was not received with the same degree of hostility.<ref>Livingstone, p. 10.</ref>\n\nA major reason for the emergence of Biblical polygenism from around the 18th century was because it became noted that the number of races could not have developed within the commonly-accepted Biblical timeframe. [[Francis Dobbs]] (1750\u20131811), an eccentric member of the Irish Parliament, believed in a different kind of biblical polygenism. In his ''Concise View from History'' written in 1800 he maintained that there was a race resulting from a clandestine affair between Eve and the Devil (see [[Serpent Seed]]).\n\nPolygenism was heavily criticized in the early 20th century [[Roman Catholic Church]], and especially by Pope [[Pius XII]] in the encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]'' (1950), on the grounds that polygenism is incompatible with the doctrine of [[Original Sin]].\n\n===Pre-Adamism===\n{{details|Pre-Adamites}}\nPre-Adamism claims there were already races of humans living before the creation of Adam. It traces back to [[Isaac La Peyr\u00e8re]] in the 17th century.\n\n===Co-Adamism===\nCo-Adamism claims that there was more than one Adam \u2013 small groups of men, created at the same time in different places across the Earth \u2013 and therefore that the different races were separately created. The idea of co-Adamism has been traced back as far as [[Paracelsus]] in 1520.<ref>Graves, Joseph, ''The Emperor's New Clothes: Biological Theories of Race at the Millennium'', Rutgers University Press, 2003, p. 25.</ref> Other 16th century advocates of co-Adamism included [[Thomas Harriot]] and [[Walter Raleigh]], who theorised a different origin for the Native Americans.<ref>Livingstone, p. 22.</ref>\n\nIn 1591 Giordano Bruno argued that because no one could imagine that the Jews and the Ethiopians had the same ancestry, then God must have either created separate Adams or Africans were the descendants of [[pre-Adamite]] races.<ref>Joseph L Graves, The Emperor's New Clothes: Biological Theories of Race at the Millennium, 2003, p. 25</ref>\n\nAn anonymous Biblical paper supporting co-Adamism was published in 1732 entitled ''Co-adamitae or an Essay to Prove the Two Following. Paradoxes, viz. I. That There Were Other Men Created at the Same time with Adam, and II. That the Angels did not fall''.<ref>Livingstone, p. 10</ref>\n\n[[Henry Home, Lord Kames]] was a believer in co-Adamism.<ref>Livingstone, p. 14</ref> Home believed God had created different races on Earth in separate regions. In his book ''Sketches on the History of Man'' in 1734 Home claimed that the environment, climate, or state of society could not account for racial differences, so that the races must have come from distinct, separate stocks.<ref>John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, pp. 39 - 41</ref>\n\n[[Charles White (physician)|Charles White]] was another advocate of co-Adamism, although he used less theology to support his views.<ref>Livingstone, p. 15.</ref> White's ''Account of the Regular Gradation in Man'' in 1799, provided the empirical science for polygenism. White defended the theory of polygeny by refuting French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]]'s [[interfertility]] argument  the theory that only the same species can interbreed \u2013 pointing to species hybrids such as foxes, wolves and jackals, which were separate groups that were still able to interbreed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.understandingrace.org/history/science/one_race.html |title=RACE - History - One Race or Several Species |publisher=Understandingrace.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}</ref>\n\n[[Charles Hamilton Smith]], a naturalist from England, was a polygenist: he believed races had been created separately. He published the book ''The Natural History of the Human Species'' in 1848. In the book he maintained that there had always been three fundamentally distinct human types: the Caucasian, the Mongolian and the Negro. He also referred to the polygenist [[Samuel George Morton]]'s work in America.<ref>[[Gustav Jahoda]], Crossroads Between Culture and Mind: Continuities and Change in Theories of Human Nature, 1993, p. 93</ref> [[Samuel Kneeland (naturalist)|Samuel Kneeland]] wrote an 84-page introduction to the American edition of the book where he laid out evidence which supports polygenist creationism and that the Bible is entirely compatible with multiple Adams.<ref>David N. Livingstone, Adam's ancestors: race, religion, and the politics of human origins, 2008, pp. 97-99</ref>\n\n[[John William Colenso]], a theologian and biblical scholar, was a polygenist who believed in co-Adamism. Colenso pointed to monuments and artifacts in Egypt to debunk monogenist beliefs that all races came from the same stock. For example, Ancient Egyptian representations of races showed exactly how the races looked in his time. Egyptological evidence indicated the existence of remarkable permanent differences in the shape of the skull, bodily form, colour and physiognomy between different races which are difficult to reconcile with biblical monogenesis. Colenso believed that racial variation between races was so great, that there was no way in which all the races could have come from the same stock just a few thousand years ago. He was unconvinced that climate could change racial variation and also believed, in common with other biblical polygenists, that monogenists had interpreted the Bible wrongly.<ref name=\"ColinKidd\">Colin Kidd, The forging of races: race and scripture in the Protestant Atlantic world, 1600 - 2000, 2006, pp. 153-156</ref>\n\nColenso said: \"It seems most probable that the human race, as it now exists, had really sprung from more than one pair\". Colenso denied that polygenism caused any kind of racist attitudes or practices; like many other polygenists he claimed monogenesis was the cause of slavery and racism. Colenso claimed that each race had sprung from a different pair of parents, and that all races were created equal by God.<ref name=\"ColinKidd\" />\n\n===Criticism of the ''Table of Nations''===\n{{details|Sons of Noah}}\nBiblical polygenists such as Colenso, [[Louis Agassiz]], [[Josiah Clark Nott]] and [[George Gliddon]] maintained that many of the races on Earth, such as Africans and Asians, were not featured in the ''[[Table of Nations]]'' in Genesis 10. They argued that its authors' knowledge was limited to their own region. Nott in his books claimed this, and that the Bible does not concern the whole of the Earth's population. According to Nott, there are no verses in the Bible which support monogenism; and that the only passage the monogenists use is Acts 17:26, where (he wrote) the monogenists are wrong in their interpretation of this verse because the \"one blood\" of Paul's sermon only includes the nations he knew existed, which were local.<ref>Scott Mandelbrote, ''Nature and Scripture in the Abrahamic Religions: 1700-Present'', Volume 2, 2010. pp. 151 - 154</ref>\n\n==Atheist polygenism==\nAccording to Lansdown (2006), \"Polygenism, the concept of different human species, was heretical and 'atheistic'; it was embraced only by the most isolated and heterodox thinkers\".<ref>Richard Lansdown, Strangers in the South Seas, 2006, p. 193</ref> Atheist polygenism was most notably supported by [[Ephraim Squier]] (1821\u20131888).<ref>Curtis M.

Cohen, James D. Le Sueur, The French encounter with Africans: white response to Blacks, 1530-1880 1980, p. 233</ref>\n\nThe British atheist leader [[Charles Bradlaugh]] was also interested in the theory of polygenesis.

Because of the encounters with different races, many people could not believe that they had the same ancestry of other races, because of the extreme racial differences. Many [[explorers]] and [[scientists]] visited other countries to observe and study different races and write down their findings. Later they went back to their own countries to publish books and journals on their findings and claim that the evidence supported polygenism.<ref>John P. Jackson, Nadine M.

He believed each race had separate origins because they were so racially diverse.

Our wise men have said that man was created in the image of God. Now here is a lovely image of the Divine Maker: a flat and black nose with little or hardly any intelligence.

These works sparked the first formal Polygenist vs. Monogenist debates across America, and advocates of the polygenism school became known as '''pluralists'''. Since Louis Agassiz backed the pluralists, polygenism received mainstream public approval and wide exposure during the 1840s-1860s. Numerous articles promoting polygenist views were published in the ''American Journal of Science and Arts'' during this time period.<ref>Lurie, Edward, ''Louis Agassiz and the Races of Man'', Isis, Vol. 45, No. 3, Sep., 1954, p. 232</ref>\n\nThe archeologist [[Ephraim George Squier]] helped Morton's polygenism by excavating an ancient cranium from the midwestern mounds and sending a drawing of it to Morton. Morton found its similarities striking to Central and South American crania, confirming his belief that the American Indian nations had a common and indigenous origin. Morton's polygenism explicitly stated the [[Mound builder (people)|Mound Builder]]s were an American Indian race of great antiquity, they did not migrate from Asia, and their physical form has remained essentially unchanged in their descendants.<ref>John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman ''Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction'', Rutgers University Press, 2005, pp. 49-50</ref> Both Squier and Gliddon demonstrated for Morton the permanence of racial characteristics, and the suitability of each race to the region for which it had been created.\n\nAmerican Indians supported Morton's conclusions, whilst some white archaeologists supported Morton. Others such as [[William Pidgeon (archaeologist)|William Pidgeon]] did not accept Morton's conclusions because at the time some white archaeologists such as Pidgeon could not believe that Native Americans had created the archaeological remains they saw around them; instead William Pidgeon wrote a book called ''Traditions of Dee-Coo-Dah and Antiquarian Researches'' in 1858.<ref>Pidgeon, William (1858) Traditions of Dee-Coo-Dah and Antiquarian Researches. Horace Thayer, New York</ref> In the book Pidgeon attempts to prove that a vanished race, culturally superior to and existing earlier than the American Indians, occupied America first and that The Mound Builders were not Native Americans. Pidgeon's book was revealed mostly to be a hoax. The famed archaeologist Theodore H. Lewis later revealed that Pidgeon had fabricated most of his research and distorted much of the rest of it, mapping mounds where none existed and changing the arrangement of existing mound groups to suit his needs.<ref>Lewis, Theodore H.

Yet the influence of polygenism persisted for many years. For example, the Hamitic Hypothesis, which argued that certain African populations were the descendants of a proto-white invasion in the ancient past, was influenced by polygenism and continued to hold sway in linguistics and anthropology until the 1950s.<ref>Michael F. Robinson, The Lost White Tribe: Explorers, Scientists, and the Theory that Changed a Continent (New York: Oxford University Press, 2016), 85-94.</ref> Darwin did not address man's origin directly at this stage, and the argument continued for a number of years, with the creation of the [[Anthropological Society of London]] in 1863 in the shadow of the [[American civil war]], in opposition to the abolitionist [[Ethnological Society of London|Ethnological Society]]. The Anthropologicals had the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] agent [[Henry Hotze]] permanently on their council.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|2009|pp=332\u2013341}}</ref> The two societies did not heal their differences until they merged in 1871 to form the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Anthropological Institute]].\n\n[[Georges Pouchet]], the French naturalist and anatomist, was a polygenist. Pouchet made contributions in several scientific fields, and specialised in comparative anatomy of fishes and whales. He was a prime advocate of polygeny, and was the author of an anthropological work titled'' De la Pluralit\u00e9 des Races Humaines'' (1858), which was translated into English as ''The Plurality of the Human Race'' in 1864 by the Anthropological Society.\n\n[[John Thurnam]] with [[Joseph Barnard Davis]] published a work in two volumes under the title of ''Crania Britannica'' in 1865, important for [[craniometry]]. Thurnam and Davis were both believers in polygenism, in the form that different races had been created separately. Davis was a collector of crania, and had over 1700 specimens.<ref>Bronwen Douglas, Chris Ballard, ''Foreign bodies: Oceania and the science of race 1750-1940'', 2008, pp. 219-223</ref> Because of the racial differences of the crania, Davis and Thurnam believed that proofs of polygenism were to be found in studying the skull types of different races. Davis also wrote ''Thesaurus craniorum: catalogue of the skulls of the various races of man'' (1875).\n\nAlthough it took many years, polygenism, which required species to be created in specific geographic locations and to remain immutable, has been almost entirely replaced among scientists by Darwin's theory of evolution from a common ancestor.  Persistent antagonism to Darwinian theory is today primarily a matter of religious or political viewpoint.<ref>see Darwin's Sacred Cause (2009), A Desmond and J Moore, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; and other works by these authors as a team or individually.</ref>\n\n== Polygenist evolution==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Racetheories.jpg|thumb|\"The different human races developed from different breeds of ape...the following eight pages show startling resemblances between types of ape and different human races\" - The Beginning Was the End, 1971.]] -->\n\nPolygenist evolution is the belief that humans evolved independently from separate species of apes. This can be traced back to [[Karl Vogt]] in 1864. Polygenist evolution allowed polygenists to link each race to an altogether different ape. This was shown in the work of [[Hermann Klaatsch]] and [[F. G. Crookshank]].<ref>Eviatar Zerubavel, ''Time Maps: Collective Memory and the Social Shape of the Past'', 2004, pp. 70-71</ref>\n\n[[Karl Vogt]] believed that the inhabitants of Africa were related to the ape, and was separate from those of European descent. In Chapter VII of his ''Lectures of man'' (1864) he compared both ethnicities, describing them as \"two extreme human types\". The difference between them, he claimed, are greater than those between two species of ape; and this proves the two are a separate species altogether.<ref name=\"GustavJahoda\">[[Gustav Jahoda]], Images of savages: ancient roots of modern prejudice in Western culture, 1999, p. 83</ref>\n\nIn an unusual blend of contemporary evolutionary thinking and [[pre-Adamism]], the [[theistic evolutionist]] and geologist Alexander Winchell argued in his 1878 book ''Adamites and Preadamites'' for the pre-Adamic origins of the human race on the basis that Africans were too racially inferior to have developed from the Biblical Adam. Winchell also believed that the laws of evolution operated according to the will of God.<ref>Christian Smith, The secular revolution: power, interests, and conflict in the secularization, 2003, p. 50</ref>\n\nBefore Darwin published his theory of evolution and [[common descent]] in his ''Origin of Species'' (1859), scientific theories or models of Polygenism (such as Agassiz's) were strictly [[creationist]]. Even after Darwin's book was published, Agassiz still stuck to his scientific form of polygenist creationism and denounced the idea of evolution. However, by the late 19th century most scientific polygenists had abandoned Agassiz's creationism and began to embrace polygenist forms of evolution. This even included many students of Agassiz, including [[Nathaniel Shaler]], who had studied under Agassiz at [[Harvard]].<ref>Cohen, Nancy, ''The reconstruction of American liberalism, 1865-1914'', UNC Press Books, 2002, p. 77</ref> Shaler continued to believe in polygenism, but believed the different races evolved from different primates. The prominent French anthropologist [[Paul Broca]] by 1878 had also converted from creationist polygenism to accepting a form of polygenist evolution.<ref>Langham, Ian, ''The Wider domain of evolutionary thought By Ian Langham'', Springer, 1983, p. 304.</ref>\n\nIn his work ''The Descent of Man'' (1871), [[Charles Darwin]] and some of his supporters argued for the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|monogenesis]] of the human species, seeing the common origin of all humans as essential for [[evolutionary theory]]. This is known as the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|single-origin hypothesis]]. Darwin even dedicated a chapter of his ''The Descent of Man'' to an attempt to refute the polygenists and support common ancestry of all races. Polygenist evolution views however continued into the early 20th century, and still found support amongst prominent scientists. [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] for example in his ''The Origin and Evolution of Life'' (1916) claimed blacks and whites both evolved from different primates.<ref>Eviatar, Zerubavel, ''Time Maps: Collective Memory and the Social Shape of the Past'', University of Chicago Press, 2004, p. 70.</ref>\n\n[[Alfred Russel Wallace]] was also an advocate of polygenist evolution, claiming that the physical differences in races must have occurred at such a remote time in the past before humans had any intelligence, when natural selection was still operative on human bodies.  The differentiation into separate races with distinct physical traits must have happened so soon after humans had just appeared on Earth that for all practical purposes all races had always been distinct.<ref>Jackson, John, Race, racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, p. 68</ref>\n\nIn contrast to most of Darwin's supporters, [[Ernst Haeckel]] put forward a doctrine of evolutionary polygenism based on the ideas of the linguist and polygenist [[August Schleicher]], in which several different language groups had arisen separately from speechless prehuman Urmenschen, which themselves had evolved from simian ancestors. These separate languages had completed the transition from animals to man, and, under the influence of each main branch of languages, humans had evolved as separate species, which could be subdivided into races. Haeckel divided human beings into ten races, of which the Caucasian was the highest and the primitives were doomed to extinction.<ref>John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, p. 87</ref>\n\nHaeckel claimed that Africans have stronger and more freely movable toes than any other race, which he interpreted as evidence that members of the race were closely related to apes. Reasoning that apes use their toes to cling tightly to tree branches, Haeckel compared Africans to \"four-handed\" apes. Haeckel also believed that Blacks were savages and that Whites were significantly more civilized.<ref name=\"GustavJahoda\" />\n\n== Modern religious adherents ==\n* A tenet of [[Ra\u00eblism]] holds that the different races of humans were created by separate teams of extraterrestrial scientists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raelpress.org/news.php?item.207.1 |title=Raelian Press Site: Rael: 'Akhil Bakshi is right; all races were created separately! |publisher=Raelpress.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}</ref>\n* Several minor Christian groups still embrace Biblical polygenism (pre-Adamism or co-Adamism).<ref>Michael Barkun, Religion and the racist right: the origins of the Christian Identity movement, p.150-172</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Historical definitions of race]]\n*[[Monogenism]]\n*[[Multiregional origin of modern humans|Multiregional hypothesis]]\n*[[Polygenesis (linguistics)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/02/13/ST2009021302658.html \"Darwin the liberator: How evolutionary thought undermined the rationale for slavery\"] ''Washington Post'' (February 15, 2009).

This view is opposite to the idea of [[monogenism]], which posits a single origin of humanity. Modern scientific views no longer favor the polygenic model, with the monogenic [[Recent African origin of modern humans|\"Out of Africa\" theory]] and its variants being the most widely accepted models for human origins.<ref name=\"Fluehr-Lobban 2006 p. 39\">{{cite book | last=Fluehr-Lobban | first=C. | title=Race and Racism: An Introduction | publisher=AltaMira Press | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-7591-0795-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3lq3XDz39pIC&pg=PA39 | access-date=Sep 9, 2017 | page=39}}</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n\nMany [[oral tradition]]s feature polygenesis in their [[creation stories]]. For example, [[Bambuti mythology]] and other creation stories from the [[pygmies]] of Congo state that the supreme God of the pygmies, [[Khonvoum]], created three different races of humans separately out of three kinds of clay: one black, one white, and one red.<ref>Mbiti, John, ''African Religions & philosophy'', Heinemann, 1990, p. 91.</ref>  In some cultures, polygenism in the creation narrative served as an [[etiological]] function.  These narratives provided an explanation as to why other people groups exist who are not affiliated with their tribe.  Moreover, distinctions made between the creation of foreign people groups and the tribe or ethnic group to which the creation myth pertains served to reinforce tribal or ethnic unity, the need to exercise wariness and caution when dealing with outsiders, or the unique nature of the relationship between that tribe and the deities of their religious system.\n\nAn example may be found in the creation myth of the [[Asmat people]], a [[hunter-gatherer]] tribe situated along the south-western coast of [[New Guinea]].  This creation myth asserts that the Asmat themselves came into being when a deity placed carved wooden statues in a ceremonial house and began to beat a drum.  The statues became living humans and began to dance.  Some time later, a great crocodile attempted to attack this ceremonial house, but was defeated by the power of the deity.  The crocodile was cut into several pieces and these were tossed in different directions.  Each piece became one of the foreign tribes known to the Asmat.<ref>Feder, Kenneth L.; Michael Alan Park, ''Human Antiquity:  An Introduction to Physical Anthropology and Archaeology,'' Mayfield Publishing Company, 1989, pp. 3-4.</ref>\n\nThe idea is also found in some ancient Greek and Roman literature. For example, the Roman Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] in his ''Letter to a Priest'' wrote that he believed Zeus made multiple creations of man and women.<ref>Julian, ''Letter to a Priest'', trans. WC Wright, ''The Works of the Emperor Julian'', 3 vols. LCL, Cambridge, Mass., 1913-23.</ref> In his ''Against the Galilaens'' Julian presented his reasoning for this belief. Julian had noticed that the [[Germanics]] and [[Scythians]] (northern nations) were different in their bodies (i.e. complexion) to the [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]]. He therefore could not imagine such difference in physical attributes as having originated from common ancestry, and so maintained separate creations for different races.\n\nIn early classical and medieval geography the idea of polygenism surfaced because of the suggested possibility of there being inhabitants of the [[antipodes]] ([[Antichthones]]). These inhabitants were considered by some to have separate origins because of their geographical extremity.<ref>Flint, Valeria, ''Monsters and the Antipodes in the Early Middle Ages and Enlightenment'', Viator, Vol. 15, 1984, pp. 65-80.</ref>\n\nThe [[religion]] of the [[Ainu people]] claims that the ancestors of the Ainu people arrived on Earth from the skies separate from the other races. See [[Ainu creation myth]].\n\n==Main beliefs==\n\nTraditionally, most Jews, Christians and Muslims have embraced [[monogenism]] in the form that all modern humans ultimately are descended from a single mating pair, named [[Adam and Eve]].  In this context, polygenism described all alternative explanations for the origin of humankind that involved more than two individual \"first people\".  This definition of polygenism is still employed among some [[Creationists]] and within the Roman Catholic Church (see ''[[Humani generis]]'').\n\nWith the development of the evolutionary paradigm of human origins, it has become widely recognized within the scientific community that at no point did there exist a single \"first man\" and a single \"first woman\" who constituted the first true humans and to whom all lineages of modern humans ultimately converge.  If Adam and Eve ever existed as distinct historical persons, they were members of a much larger population of the same species.<ref>Tenesa, P. Navarro, B. J. Hayes et al. \"Recent Human Effective Population Size Estimated from Linkage Disequilibrium,\" ''Genome Research'' 17 (2007), pp. 520\u20136</ref>  However, a common scientific explanation of human origins asserts that the population directly ancestral to all modern humans remained united as a single population by constant [[gene flow]].  Therefore, on the level of the entire human population, this explanation of human origin is classified as monogenism.  All modern humans share the same origin from this single ancestral population.\n\nModern polygenists do not accept either theological or scientific monogenism.  They believe that the variation among human racial types cannot be accounted for by monogenism or by evolutionary processes occurring since the proposed [[recent African origin of modern humans]].  Polygenists reject the argument that human races must belong to a single species because they can interbreed. There are several polygenist hypotheses, including biblical creationist polygenism and polygenist evolution.<ref>David N. Livingstone, Adam's ancestors: race, religion, and the politics of human origins, 2008</ref><ref>John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005</ref>\n\n==The Bible==\nTo make polygenism compatible with the Biblical account in the early chapters of the ''[[Book of Genesis]]'', some argument is needed to the effect that what is in the Bible is incomplete. Three standard positions are:\n\n*[[Pre-Adamism]];\n*Co-Adamism;<ref>For pre-Adamism and co-Adamism, see Livingstone, David, ''The Preadamite Theory and the Marriage of Science and Religion'', Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, New Series, Vol. 82, No. 3, 1992, p. 63.</ref>\n*incompleteness of the ''[[Table of Nations]]'' in Genesis 10.\n\nIn Christian terms, polygenesis remained an uncommon [[exegesis|Biblical interpretation]] until the mid-19th century, and was largely considered [[heresy|heretical]]; however, it has been pointed out by some modern scholars that, while Pre-Adamism was strongly rejected by most and deemed heretical, Co-Adamism was not received with the same degree of hostility.<ref>Livingstone, p. 10.</ref>\n\nA major reason for the emergence of Biblical polygenism from around the 18th century was because it became noted that the number of races could not have developed within the commonly-accepted Biblical timeframe. [[Francis Dobbs]] (1750\u20131811), an eccentric member of the Irish Parliament, believed in a different kind of biblical polygenism. In his ''Concise View from History'' written in 1800 he maintained that there was a race resulting from a clandestine affair between Eve and the Devil (see [[Serpent Seed]]).\n\nPolygenism was heavily criticized in the early 20th century [[Roman Catholic Church]], and especially by Pope [[Pius XII]] in the encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]'' (1950), on the grounds that polygenism is incompatible with the doctrine of [[Original Sin]].\n\n===Pre-Adamism===\n{{details|Pre-Adamites}}\nPre-Adamism claims there were already races of humans living before the creation of Adam. It traces back to [[Isaac La Peyr\u00e8re]] in the 17th century.\n\n===Co-Adamism===\nCo-Adamism claims that there was more than one Adam \u2013 small groups of men, created at the same time in different places across the Earth \u2013 and therefore that the different races were separately created. The idea of co-Adamism has been traced back as far as [[Paracelsus]] in 1520.<ref>Graves, Joseph, ''The Emperor's New Clothes: Biological Theories of Race at the Millennium'', Rutgers University Press, 2003, p. 25.</ref> Other 16th century advocates of co-Adamism included [[Thomas Harriot]] and [[Walter Raleigh]], who theorised a different origin for the Native Americans.<ref>Livingstone, p. 22.</ref>\n\nIn 1591 Giordano Bruno argued that because no one could imagine that the Jews and the Ethiopians had the same ancestry, then God must have either created separate Adams or Africans were the descendants of [[pre-Adamite]] races.<ref>Joseph L Graves, The Emperor's New Clothes: Biological Theories of Race at the Millennium, 2003, p. 25</ref>\n\nAn anonymous Biblical paper supporting co-Adamism was published in 1732 entitled ''Co-adamitae or an Essay to Prove the Two Following. Paradoxes, viz. I. That There Were Other Men Created at the Same time with Adam, and II. That the Angels did not fall''.<ref>Livingstone, p. 10</ref>\n\n[[Henry Home, Lord Kames]] was a believer in co-Adamism.<ref>Livingstone, p. 14</ref> Home believed God had created different races on Earth in separate regions. In his book ''Sketches on the History of Man'' in 1734 Home claimed that the environment, climate, or state of society could not account for racial differences, so that the races must have come from distinct, separate stocks.<ref>John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, pp. 39 - 41</ref>\n\n[[Charles White (physician)|Charles White]] was another advocate of co-Adamism, although he used less theology to support his views.<ref>Livingstone, p. 15.</ref> White's ''Account of the Regular Gradation in Man'' in 1799, provided the empirical science for polygenism. White defended the theory of polygeny by refuting French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]]'s [[interfertility]] argument  the theory that only the same species can interbreed \u2013 pointing to species hybrids such as foxes, wolves and jackals, which were separate groups that were still able to interbreed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.understandingrace.org/history/science/one_race.html |title=RACE - History - One Race or Several Species |publisher=Understandingrace.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}</ref>\n\n[[Charles Hamilton Smith]], a naturalist from England, was a polygenist: he believed races had been created separately. He published the book ''The Natural History of the Human Species'' in 1848. In the book he maintained that there had always been three fundamentally distinct human types: the Caucasian, the Mongolian and the Negro. He also referred to the polygenist [[Samuel George Morton]]'s work in America.<ref>[[Gustav Jahoda]], Crossroads Between Culture and Mind: Continuities and Change in Theories of Human Nature, 1993, p. 93</ref> [[Samuel Kneeland (naturalist)|Samuel Kneeland]] wrote an 84-page introduction to the American edition of the book where he laid out evidence which supports polygenist creationism and that the Bible is entirely compatible with multiple Adams.<ref>David N. Livingstone, Adam's ancestors: race, religion, and the politics of human origins, 2008, pp. 97-99</ref>\n\n[[John William Colenso]], a theologian and biblical scholar, was a polygenist who believed in co-Adamism. Colenso pointed to monuments and artifacts in Egypt to debunk monogenist beliefs that all races came from the same stock. For example, Ancient Egyptian representations of races showed exactly how the races looked in his time. Egyptological evidence indicated the existence of remarkable permanent differences in the shape of the skull, bodily form, colour and physiognomy between different races which are difficult to reconcile with biblical monogenesis. Colenso believed that racial variation between races was so great, that there was no way in which all the races could have come from the same stock just a few thousand years ago. He was unconvinced that climate could change racial variation and also believed, in common with other biblical polygenists, that monogenists had interpreted the Bible wrongly.<ref name=\"ColinKidd\">Colin Kidd, The forging of races: race and scripture in the Protestant Atlantic world, 1600 - 2000, 2006, pp. 153-156</ref>\n\nColenso said: \"It seems most probable that the human race, as it now exists, had really sprung from more than one pair\". Colenso denied that polygenism caused any kind of racist attitudes or practices; like many other polygenists he claimed monogenesis was the cause of slavery and racism. Colenso claimed that each race had sprung from a different pair of parents, and that all races were created equal by God.<ref name=\"ColinKidd\" />\n\n===Criticism of the ''Table of Nations''===\n{{details|Sons of Noah}}\nBiblical polygenists such as Colenso, [[Louis Agassiz]], [[Josiah Clark Nott]] and [[George Gliddon]] maintained that many of the races on Earth, such as Africans and Asians, were not featured in the ''[[Table of Nations]]'' in Genesis 10. They argued that its authors' knowledge was limited to their own region. Nott in his books claimed this, and that the Bible does not concern the whole of the Earth's population. According to Nott, there are no verses in the Bible which support monogenism; and that the only passage the monogenists use is Acts 17:26, where (he wrote) the monogenists are wrong in their interpretation of this verse because the \"one blood\" of Paul's sermon only includes the nations he knew existed, which were local.<ref>Scott Mandelbrote, ''Nature and Scripture in the Abrahamic Religions: 1700-Present'', Volume 2, 2010. pp. 151 - 154</ref>\n\n==Atheist polygenism==\nAccording to Lansdown (2006), \"Polygenism, the concept of different human species, was heretical and 'atheistic'; it was embraced only by the most isolated and heterodox thinkers\".<ref>Richard Lansdown, Strangers in the South Seas, 2006, p. 193</ref> Atheist polygenism was most notably supported by [[Ephraim Squier]] (1821\u20131888).<ref>Curtis M.

Because of the encounters with different races, many people could not believe that they had the same ancestry of other races, because of the extreme racial differences. Many [[explorers]] and [[scientists]] visited other countries to observe and study different races and write down their findings.

Our wise men have said that man was created in the image of God. Now here is a lovely image of the Divine Maker: a flat and black nose with little or hardly any intelligence.

These theories proposed a graduation from \u2018civilisation\u2019 to \u2018barbarism\u2019, at once justifying the European acquisition of foreign territories and highlighting the belief in the singular role of the Europeans as a civilizing force.\n\n====Georges Cuvier====\n[[Georges Cuvier]], a French [[naturalist]] and [[Zoology|zoologist]], believed there were three distinct races: the [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] (\"white\"), the [[Mongols|Mongolian]] (\"yellow\") and the [[Ethiopia]]n (\"black\"). Cuvier claimed [[Adam and Eve]] were Caucasian, forming the original race of mankind, while the other two races originated by survivors escaping in different directions after a major catastrophe hit the Earth 5,000 years ago, with those survivors then living in complete isolation from each other.<ref>John P.

According to Cuvier the white race was at the top and the black race was at the bottom.<ref>Benjamin H. Isaac, ''The invention of racism in classical antiquity, 2006, p. 105</ref>\n\nCuvier wrote regarding Caucasians:\n\n<blockquote>The white race, with oval face, straight hair and nose, to which the civilised people of Europe belong and which appear to us the most beautiful of all, is also superior to others by its genius, courage and activity.<ref>Georges Cuvier, ''Tableau elementaire de l'histoire naturelle des animaux'' (Paris, 1798) p.71</ref></blockquote>\n\nRegarding those he termed \"Ethiopian,\" Cuvier wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The Negro race ... is marked by black complexion, crisped of woolly hair, compressed cranium and a flat nose, The projection of the lower parts of the face, and the thick lips, evidently approximate it to the monkey tribe: the hordes of which it consists have always remained in the most complete state of barbarism.<ref name=\"Cuvier1834\">{{cite book|author=Georges baron Cuvier|title=The Animal Kingdom, arranged in conformity with its organization.

Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman, ''Race, racism, and science: social impact and interaction'',  Rutgers University Press, 2005, p. 42</ref>\n\n*Fixity of species\n*Strict limits on environmental influence\n*Unchanging underlying type\n*Anatomical and cranial measurement differences in races\n*Physical and mental differences between racial worth\n*Human races are all distinct\n\n====Prichard====\nScientific polygenism became popular in France in the 1820s in response to [[James Cowles Prichard]]'s ''Researches into the Physical History of Man'' (1813) which was considered a pioneering work of monogenism.<ref>Augstein, Hannah,\n''James Cowles Prichard's anthropology: remaking the science of man in early nineteenth-century Britain'', Rodopi, 1999, p. 58.</ref> An anthropological school advocating polygenism arose to counter Prichard's monogenism in France.<ref>Augstein, p. 59.</ref> Key French polygenists of this period included the naturalist [[Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent]] and [[Louis-Antoine Desmoulins]] (1796\u20131828), a student of Georges Cuvier.<ref>Augstein, p. 60.</ref>\n\n====Retzius====\n[[Anders Retzius]], a Swedish professor of anatomy, was a polygenist. Retzius studied many different skull types, and because the skulls were so different he believed that the races had a separate origin.<ref>Peter Rowley-Conwy, ''From Genesis to Prehistory: The Archaeological Three Age System and its Contested Reception in Denmark, Britain, and Ireland'', 2007, p. 120</ref>\n\n====Later European trends====\nPolygenist schools arose in the 1830s and 1840s across Europe. The Scottish anatomist and zoologist [[Robert Knox]] was considered to have influenced polygenism in Britain; he argued in his ''The Races of Men'' (1850) that \"[r]acial natures ... were unchanging over thousands of years, and were so different that they should be called different species\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race, Racism, and Science: Social Impact and Interaction|last=Jackson|first=John P.|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-1-851-09448-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4WalMw26IkC&pg=PA52|last2=Weidman|first2=Nadine M.|year=2004|location=1 January 2004|edition=Illustrated|access-date=25 April 2015|pages=52\u201354}}</ref> A colleague of Knox, [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]], was also an early author who promoted polygenism in Britain, though he was more concerned with establishing white superiority. Hunt dedicated his ''On the Negro's Place in Nature'' (1863) to Knox who had died a year before its publication.<ref>Claeys, Gregory, ''Encyclopedia of nineteenth-century thought'', Taylor & Francis, 2005, p. 21.</ref>\n\n[[John Crawfurd]], a Scottish physician, and colonial administrator, was a polygenist. He studied the geography of where different races were located, and believed that different races had been created separately by God in specific regional zones for climatic circumstance.<ref>David N. Livingstone, ''Adam's ancestors: race, religion, and the politics of human origins'', 2008, p. 112</ref>\n\n====American views====\n[[Charles Caldwell (physician)|Charles Caldwell]] was one of the earliest supporters of polygenism in America. Caldwell attacked the position that environment was the cause of racial differences and argued instead that four races, Caucasian, Mongolian, American Indian, and African, were four different species, created separately by God.<ref>John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman, ''Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction'', Rutgers University Press, 2005, p. 45</ref>\n\n[[Charles Pickering (naturalist)]] was the librarian and a curator of the Academy of Natural Sciences. In 1843, he traveled to Africa and India to research human races. In 1848, Pickering published ''Races of Man and Their Geographical Distribution'', which enumerated eleven races.\n\n[[File:Races and skulls.png|200px|right|thumb|Indigenous Races of the Earth (1857), [[Josiah Clark Nott]] and [[George Robins Gliddon]] implied that \"Negroes\" were a [[Creationism|creational]] rank between \"Greeks\" and [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s.]]\n\nPolygenism came into mainstream scientific thought in America in the mid 19th century with the work of several corresponding natural scientists such as [[Samuel George Morton]] and [[Charles Pickering (naturalist)|Charles Pickering]] as well as Egyptologist [[George Gliddon]], the surgeon [[Josiah Clark Nott]] and more prominently the paleontologist and geologist [[Louis Agassiz]] in the [[United States]]. All had contributed to a major ethnological work of 738 pages entitled ''Types of Mankind'' which was published in 1854<ref>\n{{Cite journal|first1=J.C.|last1=Nott|first2=G.R.|last2=Gliddon|title=Types of Mankind|year=1854|place=Philadelphia|publisher=Lippincott|url=https://archive.org/details/typesmankindore01pattgoog|author1-link=Josiah C. Nott|author2-link=George Gliddon|ref=harv}}\n</ref> and was a great success; it was followed by a sequel ''Indigenous Races of the Earth'' (1857). These works sparked the first formal Polygenist vs. Monogenist debates across America, and advocates of the polygenism school became known as '''pluralists'''. Since Louis Agassiz backed the pluralists, polygenism received mainstream public approval and wide exposure during the 1840s-1860s. Numerous articles promoting polygenist views were published in the ''American Journal of Science and Arts'' during this time period.<ref>Lurie, Edward, ''Louis Agassiz and the Races of Man'', Isis, Vol. 45, No. 3, Sep., 1954, p. 232</ref>\n\nThe archeologist [[Ephraim George Squier]] helped Morton's polygenism by excavating an ancient cranium from the midwestern mounds and sending a drawing of it to Morton. Morton found its similarities striking to Central and South American crania, confirming his belief that the American Indian nations had a common and indigenous origin. Morton's polygenism explicitly stated the [[Mound builder (people)|Mound Builder]]s were an American Indian race of great antiquity, they did not migrate from Asia, and their physical form has remained essentially unchanged in their descendants.<ref>John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman ''Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction'', Rutgers University Press, 2005, pp. 49-50</ref> Both Squier and Gliddon demonstrated for Morton the permanence of racial characteristics, and the suitability of each race to the region for which it had been created.\n\nAmerican Indians supported Morton's conclusions, whilst some white archaeologists supported Morton. Others such as [[William Pidgeon (archaeologist)|William Pidgeon]] did not accept Morton's conclusions because at the time some white archaeologists such as Pidgeon could not believe that Native Americans had created the archaeological remains they saw around them, instead William Pidgeon wrote a book called ''Traditions of Dee-Coo-Dah and Antiquarian Researches'' in 1858.<ref>Pidgeon, William (1858) Traditions of Dee-Coo-Dah and Antiquarian Researches. Horace Thayer, New York</ref> In the book Pidgeon attempts to prove that a vanished race, culturally superior to and existing earlier than the American Indians, occupied America first and that The Mound Builders were not Native Americans. Pidgeon's book was revealed mostly to be a hoax. The famed archaeologist Theodore H. Lewis later revealed that Pidgeon had fabricated most of his research, and distorted much of the rest of it, mapping mounds where none existed, and changing the arrangement of existing mound groups to suit his needs.<ref>Lewis, Theodore H. (1886) \"The 'Monumental Tortoise' Mounds of 'Dee-Coo-Dah'\" The American Journal of Archaeology 2(1):65-69.</ref> Morton's work gained more support because his work was considered to be evidence of true objective science unlike others such as Pidgeon. Morton won his reputation as the great data-gatherer and objectivist of American Science. [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] praised Morton for \"The severe and cautious character\" of his works, which \"from their very nature are permanent data for all future students of ethnology\".<ref>Sandra G. Harding The \"Racial\" economy of science: toward a democratic future p. 100</ref>\n\nBy 1850 Agassiz had developed a unique form of co-Adamism. God he believed had created several different zoological provinces with different races in them, but also fauna and animals specific to those regions. An essay of Agassiz promoting this theory with maps of the zoological zones was attached as a preface to ''Types of Mankind'' in collaboration with Morton, Gliddon, Nott and others.<ref>Agassiz, ''Sketch of the natural provinces of the animal world and their relation to the different types of man'', ''Types of Mankind'', Philadelphia, 1854, p. lxxvi.</ref> Agassiz's theory developed some support amongst Christians, and he often wrote articles in Christian magazines claiming his views on polygenism were compatible with the bible.<ref>''The Diversity of Origin of Human Races'', Cristian Examiner, 49, 110-145, 1850.</ref> Christian fundamentalists however who held to [[Young Earth Creationism]] and strict monogenism (i.e. everyone on Earth from Adam and Eve) attacked his views, as well as those of Gliddon and Nott.<ref>Lurie, p. 236.</ref>\n\nUnlike Josiah Nott, the slave-owner from Alabama,<ref>\n{{Cite journal|last1=Desmond|first1=Adrian|authorlink1=Adrian Desmond|last2=Moore|first2=James|authorlink2=James Moore (biographer)|title=Darwin's Sacred Cause: Race, Slavery and the quest for human origins|publisher=Allen Lane, Penguin Books|year=2009|page=168|ref=harv}}\n</ref> Agassiz was never a supporter of slavery. He claimed his views had nothing to do with politics.<ref>John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman Race, ''Racism, and science: social impact and interaction'', Rutgers University Press, 2005, p. 51</ref>\n\n====Effect of evolutionary ideas and debates from the 1860s====\nThe notion that races were separate and came together by hybridism, rather than being variations from a common stock, was cast into doubt with the publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, which Agassiz opposed till his death. Yet the influence of polygenism persisted for many years. For example, the Hamitic Hypothesis, which argued that certain African populations were the descendants of a proto-white invasion in the ancient past, was influenced by polygenism and continued to hold sway in linguistics and anthropology until the 1950s.<ref>Michael F. Robinson, The Lost White Tribe: Explorers, Scientists, and the Theory that Changed a Continent (New York: Oxford University Press, 2016), 85-94.</ref> Darwin did not address man's origin directly at this stage, and the argument continued for a number of years, with the creation of the [[Anthropological Society of London]] in 1863 in the shadow of the [[American civil war]], in opposition to the abolitionist [[Ethnological Society of London|Ethnological Society]]. The Anthropologicals had the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] agent [[Henry Hotze]] permanently on their council.<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|2009|pp=332\u2013341}}</ref> The two societies did not heal their differences until they merged in 1871 to form the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Anthropological Institute]].\n\n[[Georges Pouchet]], the French naturalist and anatomist, was a polygenist. Pouchet made contributions in several scientific fields, and specialised in comparative anatomy of fishes and whales. He was a prime advocate of polygeny, and was the author of an anthropological work titled'' De la Pluralit\u00e9 des Races Humaines'' (1858), which was translated into English as ''The Plurality of the Human Race'' in 1864 by the Anthropological Society.\n\n[[John Thurnam]] with [[Joseph Barnard Davis]] published a work in two volumes under the title of ''Crania Britannica'' in 1865, important for [[craniometry]]. Thurnam and Davis were both believers in polygenism, in the form that different races had been created separately. Davis was a collector of crania, and had over 1700 specimens.<ref>Bronwen Douglas, Chris Ballard, ''Foreign bodies: Oceania and the science of race 1750-1940'', 2008, pp. 219-223</ref> Because of the racial differences of the crania, Davis and Thurnam believed that proofs of polygenism were to be found in studying the skull types of different races. Davis also wrote ''Thesaurus craniorum: catalogue of the skulls of the various races of man'' (1875).\n\nAlthough it took many years, polygenism, which required species to be created in specific geographic locations and to remain immutable, has been almost entirely replaced among scientists by Darwin's theory of evolution from a common ancestor.  Persistent antagonism to Darwinian theory is today primarily a matter of religious or political viewpoint.<ref>see Darwin's Sacred Cause (2009), A Desmond and J Moore, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; and other works by these authors as a team or individually.</ref>\n\n== Polygenist evolution==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Racetheories.jpg|thumb|\"The different human races developed from different breeds of ape...the following eight pages show startling resemblances between types of ape and different human races\" - The Beginning Was the End, 1971.]] -->\n\nPolygenist evolution is the belief that humans evolved independently from separate species of apes. This can be traced back to [[Karl Vogt]] in 1864. Polygenist evolution allowed polygenists to link each race to an altogether different ape. This was shown in the work of [[Hermann Klaatsch]] and [[F. G. Crookshank]].<ref>Eviatar Zerubavel, ''Time Maps: Collective Memory and the Social Shape of the Past'', 2004, pp. 70-71</ref>\n\n[[Karl Vogt]] believed that the inhabitants of Africa were related to the ape, and was separate from those of European descent. In Chapter VII of his ''Lectures of man'' (1864) he compared both ethnicities, describing them as \"two extreme human types\". The difference between them, he claimed, are greater than those between two species of ape; and this proves the two are a separate species altogether.<ref name=\"GustavJahoda\">[[Gustav Jahoda]], Images of savages: ancient roots of modern prejudice in Western culture, 1999, p. 83</ref>\n\nIn an unusual blend of contemporary evolutionary thinking and [[pre-Adamism]], the [[theistic evolutionist]] and geologist Alexander Winchell argued in his 1878 book ''Adamites and Preadamites'' for the pre-Adamic origins of the human race on the basis that Africans were too racially inferior to have developed from the Biblical Adam. Winchell also believed that the laws of evolution operated according to the will of God.<ref>Christian Smith, The secular revolution: power, interests, and conflict in the secularization, 2003, p. 50</ref>\n\nBefore Darwin published his theory of evolution and [[common descent]] in his ''Origin of Species'' (1859), scientific theories or models of Polygenism (such as Agassiz's) were strictly [[creationist]]. Even after Darwin's book was published, Agassiz still stuck to his scientific form of polygenist creationism and denounced the idea of evolution. However, by the late 19th century most scientific polygenists had abandoned Agassiz's creationism and began to embrace polygenist forms of evolution. This even included many students of Agassiz, including [[Nathaniel Shaler]], who had studied under Agassiz at [[Harvard]].<ref>Cohen, Nancy, ''The reconstruction of American liberalism, 1865-1914'', UNC Press Books, 2002, p. 77</ref> Shaler continued to believe in polygenism, but believed the different races evolved from different primates. The prominent French anthropologist [[Paul Broca]] by 1878 had also converted from creationist polygenism to accepting a form of polygenist evolution.<ref>Langham, Ian, ''The Wider domain of evolutionary thought By Ian Langham'', Springer, 1983, p. 304.</ref>\n\nIn his work ''The Descent of Man'' (1871), [[Charles Darwin]] and some of his supporters argued for the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|monogenesis]] of the human species, seeing the common origin of all humans as essential for [[evolutionary theory]]. This is known as the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|single-origin hypothesis]]. Darwin even dedicated a chapter of his ''The Descent of Man'' to an attempt to refute the polygenists and support common ancestry of all races. Polygenist evolution views however continued into the early 20th century, and still found support amongst prominent scientists. [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] for example in his ''The Origin and Evolution of Life'' (1916) claimed blacks and whites both evolved from different primates.<ref>Eviatar, Zerubavel, ''Time Maps: Collective Memory and the Social Shape of the Past'', University of Chicago Press, 2004, p. 70.</ref>\n\n[[Alfred Russel Wallace]] was also an advocate of polygenist evolution, claiming that the physical differences in races must have occurred at such a remote time in the past before humans had any intelligence, when natural selection was still operative on human bodies.  The differentiation into separate races with distinct physical traits must have happened so soon after humans had just appeared on Earth that for all practical purposes all races had always been distinct.<ref>Jackson, John, Race, racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, p. 68</ref>\n\nIn contrast to most of Darwin's supporters, [[Ernst Haeckel]] put forward a doctrine of evolutionary polygenism based on the ideas of the linguist and polygenist [[August Schleicher]], in which several different language groups had arisen separately from speechless prehuman Urmenschen, which themselves had evolved from simian ancestors. These separate languages had completed the transition from animals to man, and, under the influence of each main branch of languages, humans had evolved as separate species, which could be subdivided into races. Haeckel divided human beings into ten races, of which the Caucasian was the highest and the primitives were doomed to extinction.<ref>John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, p. 87</ref>\n\nHaeckel claimed that Africans have stronger and more freely movable toes than any other race, which he interpreted as evidence that members of the race were closely related to apes. Reasoning that apes use their toes to cling tightly to tree branches, Haeckel compared Africans to \"four-handed\" apes. Haeckel also believed that Blacks were savages and that Whites were significantly more civilized.<ref name=\"GustavJahoda\" />\n\n== Modern religious adherents ==\n* A tenet of [[Ra\u00eblism]] holds that the different races of humans were created by separate teams of extraterrestrial scientists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raelpress.org/news.php?item.207.1 |title=Raelian Press Site: Rael: 'Akhil Bakshi is right; all races were created separately! |publisher=Raelpress.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}</ref>\n* Several minor Christian groups still embrace Biblical polygenism (pre-Adamism or co-Adamism).<ref>Michael Barkun, Religion and the racist right: the origins of the Christian Identity movement, p.150-172</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Historical definitions of race]]\n*[[Monogenism]]\n*[[Multiregional origin of modern humans|Multiregional hypothesis]]\n*[[Polygenesis (linguistics)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/02/13/ST2009021302658.html \"Darwin the liberator: How evolutionary thought undermined the rationale for slavery\"] ''Washington Post'' (February 15, 2009).

It was the strongest hurricane during the 1967 [[Atlantic hurricane season]]. The hurricane made landfall just north of the mouth of the [[Rio Grande River]] as a [[SSHS#Category 3|Category&nbsp;3]]. It spawned 115 [[tornado]]es across [[Texas]], which established a new record for the highest amount of tornadoes produced by a [[tropical cyclone]].  Due to its slow movement over Texas, Beulah led to significant flooding. Throughout its path, at least 59 people were killed and total damage reached $234.6 million (1967 USD), of which $200 million occurred in the United States, $26.9 million occurred in Mexico, and $7.65 million occurred in the eastern Caribbean Sea.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Beulah 1967 track.png}}\nOn August&nbsp;22, 1967, an [[Television Infrared Observation Satellite|ESSA-5]] satellite image depicted an area of enhanced [[Atmospheric convection|convection]]\u2014shower and thunderstorm activity\u2014east of the [[Western High Plateau]] in [[Cameroon]] over central Africa. Reaching the western slopes of the mountains two days later, the [[tropical wave]] became more coherent with clouds condensing along its axis. As it moved over west Africa, [[cyclonic rotation]] became apparent about {{convert|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the surface. A research paper published in 1969 refers to the disturbance as a depression as it neared the west coast of Africa;<ref name=\"disturbancepaper\"/> however, this significantly differs from the official [[HURDAT|Atlantic hurricane database]] which does not mention the system at that time,{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} as a surface circulation likely did not exist. Regardless, the system emerged over the Atlantic Ocean around [[12th parallel north|12\u00b0N]] on August&nbsp;28, as represented by [[barometric pressure]] falls in [[Dakar, Senegal]].<ref name=\"disturbancepaper\">{{cite journal|author=Toby N.

Observations from aircraft reconnaissance indicated that the system attained gale-force winds by 12:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;7, resulting in its upgrade to a tropical storm. It was also [[Tropical cyclone naming|assigned the name]] ''Beulah'', making it the second named storm of the [[1967 Atlantic hurricane season|1967 season]]. Shortly after being named, Beulah clipped the southern coast of [[Martinique]] and entered the eastern [[Caribbean Sea]]. Feeding off the warm waters of the Caribbean, the cyclone quickly strengthened and reached hurricane intensity by 18:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;8. [[Rapid deepening]] ensued thereafter with the storm's central pressure falling to 940&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 27.75&nbsp;inHg) the following day as it passed 100&nbsp;mi (160&nbsp;km) south of [[Puerto Rico]].<ref name=\"MWR\"/> At this time winds were estimated to be at least 140&nbsp;mph (225&nbsp;km/h), ranking Beulah as a [[SSHS#Category 4|Category&nbsp;4]] on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale|Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale]].<ref name=\"HURDAT\"/> Upon reaching this strength, [[weather radar]] imagery from [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] showed that Beulah featured a 15&nbsp;mi (24&nbsp;km) wide [[Eye (cyclone)|eye]] surrounded by an intense eyewall about 8&nbsp;mi (13&nbsp;km) thick.<ref name=\"Radar\"/>\n\n[[File:Hurricane Beulah 1967 eyewall replacement.png|thumb|Radar images of Hurricane Beulah from 21:30 UTC on September 9 to 03:30 UTC on September 10, depicting its eyewall replacement cycle]]\nDuring the evening of September&nbsp;9 Beulah turned westward as weak [[Ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] developed over the [[Bahamas]], between it and the newly formed [[Hurricane Doria (1967)|Tropical Storm Doria]].<ref name=\"MWR\"/> The powerful storm weakened somewhat as an [[eyewall replacement cycle]] began to take shape.

However, the storm unexpectedly collapsed as it approached the [[Barahona Peninsula]] and struck the area as a greatly weakened, though still significant, hurricane with estimated winds of 90&nbsp;mph (150&nbsp;km/h) around 18:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;11.<ref name=\"MWR\"/><ref name=\"HURDAT\"/>\n\nSkirting the southern coast of [[Haiti]]'s [[Tiburon Peninsula, Haiti|Tiburon Peninsula]], Beulah further degraded to a tropical storm by the morning of September&nbsp;12. Unseasonably strong [[wind shear]] associated with the [[jet stream]], resulting from an upper-level [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] to the north, and the cyclone's interaction with land were responsible for the dramatic degradation. By the time it had cleared Haiti, Beulah was no more than a minimal tropical storm with winds near 40&nbsp;mph (65&nbsp;km/h).<ref name=\"MWR\"/> Its pressure had also risen by roughly 60&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 1.77&nbsp;inHg) to 1000&nbsp;mbar (hPa; 29.53&nbsp;inHg).<ref name=\"HURDAT\"/> Originally seen as a threat to [[Jamaica]], northeasterly flow induced a southerly component to the track and pushed the cyclone south of the island on September&nbsp;13. The shear previously impeding organization abated on September&nbsp;14 and a ridge re-established itself to Beulah's north, allowing the storm to resume a west-northwest to northwest track. The upper-level changes led to a  favorable environment for intensification and Beulah regained hurricane strength by 12:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;14 while located about 425&nbsp;mi (685&nbsp;km) south-southeast of [[Havana, Cuba]].<ref name=\"MWR\"/><ref name=\"HURDAT\"/><ref name=\"Prelim\">{{cite web|work=Weather Bureau|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=September 29, 1967|accessdate=October 6, 2014|title=Hurricane Beulah Preliminary Report with Advisories and Bulletins Issued|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/hurricanes/QC9452B485H81967.pdf|format=[[PDF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161214215718/http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/hurricanes/QC9452B485H81967.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hurricanes Beulah, Chloe, and Doria on September 17, 1967.png|thumb|left|A composite satellite image on September&nbsp;17 depicting Hurricanes Beulah (bottom), Doria (middle), and Chloe (top).]]\nMoving through the climatologically favorable western Caribbean,<ref name=\"MWR\"/> Beulah quickly regained major hurricane status on September&nbsp;15 with winds estimated at 115&nbsp;mph (185&nbsp;km/h).<ref name=\"HURDAT\"/> The storm's pressure fell to 964&nbsp;mb (hPa; 28.47&nbsp;inHg) on September&nbsp;16 before some weakening took place.

It tracked through the Caribbean, struck the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula of Mexico as a major hurricane, and moved west-northwest into the Gulf of Mexico, briefly gaining [[tropical cyclone scales|Category 5]] intensity. It was the strongest hurricane during the 1967 [[Atlantic hurricane season]]. The hurricane made landfall just north of the mouth of the [[Rio Grande River]] as a [[SSHS#Category 3|Category&nbsp;3]]. It spawned 115 [[tornado]]es across [[Texas]], which established a new record for the highest amount of tornadoes produced by a [[tropical cyclone]].  Due to its slow movement over Texas, Beulah led to significant flooding. Throughout its path, at least 59 people were killed and total damage reached $234.6 million (1967 USD), of which $200 million occurred in the United States, $26.9 million occurred in Mexico, and $7.65 million occurred in the eastern Caribbean Sea.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Beulah 1967 track.png}}\nOn August&nbsp;22, 1967, an [[Television Infrared Observation Satellite|ESSA-5]] satellite image depicted an area of enhanced [[Atmospheric convection|convection]]\u2014shower and thunderstorm activity\u2014east of the [[Western High Plateau]] in [[Cameroon]] over central Africa.

He went on to become NASA's first [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]] and Director of Flight Crew Operations, responsible for NASA crew assignments.\n\nSlayton joined the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]], and flew in [[European theatre of World War II|Europe]] and the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]]. He left the Army after World War II, and later joined the [[Minnesota Air National Guard]] after working for [[Boeing]] as an [[aeronautical engineer]].  He joined the [[United States Air Force]], and attended the [[Air Force Test Pilot School]] in 1955.  In 1959, he applied to, and was selected as one of the [[Mercury Seven]]. He was scheduled to pilot the second U.S. crewed [[orbital spaceflight]], but was grounded in 1962 by [[atrial fibrillation]], an irregular heart rhythm.  In March 1972, he was medically cleared to fly and was the docking module pilot of the 1975 [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]] (ASTP). He continued to work at NASA until 1982, and helped develop the [[Space Shuttle]].\n\nHe died from a brain tumor on June 13, 1993, aged 69.\n\n==Early life and career==\n[[File:Donald K.

From a young age, he worked on the farm to raise sheep and cows, and grow tobacco.  Throughout Slayton's childhood, his family's home did not have electricity or indoor plumbing. At the age of five, Slayton was clearing a horse-drawn hay mower when his left ring finger was severed.<ref name=\"deke!\"/>{{rp|10\u201315}} He attended a two-room elementary school in Leon, and graduated from Sparta High School in 1942, where he [[boxing|boxed]], played [[trombone]], and was active in the [[Future Farmers of America]] (FFA).<ref name=\"deke!\"/>{{rp|15\u201317}}\n\n===World War II===\nThe 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] by the [[Japanese Empire]] occurred during Slayton's senior year of high school.

He was initially medically delayed because of his severed ring finger, but was deemed able to fly.  Slayton began flight training in [[Vernon, Texas]], where he trained on the [[Fairchild PT-19]], the [[PT-17 Stearman]], and the [[AT-6 Texan]]. After three months of primary training, Slayton moved to [[Waco, Texas]] for basic flight training, where he flew the [[BT-13 Valiant]].  Despite Slayton's wishes to fly single-engine fighter aircraft, he was selected to fly multi-engine aircraft.  Slayton began multi-engine training on the [[Beechcraft AT-10]], Cessna AT-12, and the Curtis 18-I.  Slayton graduated from flight training on April 22, 1943, and was assigned to fly on the [[B-25 Mitchell]], his last choice for aircraft.<ref name=deke! />{{rp|18\u201322}}\n\nSlayton moved to [[Columbia Army Air Base]] in [[South Carolina]] for the three-month-long B-25 Mitchell training. After completing training, he was assigned to the [[340th Flying Training Group#World War II|340th Bombardment Group]], and departed for the [[European theatre of World War II|European theater of operations]] on ship from [[Newport News, Virginia]]. After a stop in Zerni, North Africa, his convoy travelled to [[Naples, Italy]].  While traveling near the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], their ships came under attack from German bombers and [[U-boat#World War II (1939\u20131945)|submarines]].<ref name=deke! />{{rp|23\u201324}} After he arrived in Naples, the 340th Bombardment Group moved to San Petrazio, where Slayton flew combat missions into the [[Balkan Peninsula]].  After six weeks, he moved to Foggia, where 48 aircraft were destroyed after an eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]].  Afterwards, Slayton flew out of [[Salerno]] and [[Corsica]], where he upgraded from copilot to pilot.  After 56 combat sorties, Slayton completed his combat tour and returned to the U.S. in May 1944.<ref name=deke! />{{rp|26\u201332}}\n\nImmediately upon his return to Columbia Army Air Base to serve as a B-25 instructor, Slayton applied and was accepted to fly the new [[A-26 Invader]] bomber aircraft.  He moved to [[Selfridge Field]] in [[Michigan]] for training, and began preparing for a deployment to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]].  In July 1945, he arrived on [[Okinawa Island]] and joined the [[319th Operations Group#World War II|319th Bombardment Group]].  He flew seven combat missions over [[Japan]], and encountered little Japanese resistance.  Slayton flew his final combat mission on August 12, three days after the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Nagasaki|bombing of Nagasaki]], and spent two months waiting for his return to the U.S.  After the war, Slayton worked as B-25 instructor in [[Albany, Georgia]] and [[Boca Raton, Florida]], and separated from the Army in November 1946.<ref name=deke! />{{rp|33\u201340}}<ref name=nmspace />\n\n===Post-World War II===\nAfter he was discharged from the Army, Slayton enrolled at the [[University of Minnesota]], in [[Minneapolis]], and studied [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineering]].

He transitioned to the [[Minnesota Air National Guard]] (ANG), after accepting a demotion from captain to second lieutenant, to allow him to fly the A-26 Invader and [[P-51 Mustang]].  He left the Minnesota ANG when he moved to Seattle.  Slayton attempted to join an Air Force Reserve unit in Seattle at the start of the [[Korean War]], but was rejected on the grounds that his inactive reserve status had expired.  He contacted his previous squadron commander in Minnesota, and accepted his offer to rejoin his former squadron in February 1951.  Upon his return, Slayton was initially medically disqualified from flying for his eyesight. He served as a maintenance officer while waiting for his medical clearance, and then became a maintenance flight test officer once he had returned to flying status.<ref name=deke! />{{rp|40\u201349}}\n\nIn 1952, Slayton transferred to active duty Air Force from the Air National Guard.

He went on to become NASA's first [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]] and Director of Flight Crew Operations, responsible for NASA crew assignments.\n\nSlayton joined the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]], and flew in [[European theatre of World War II|Europe]] and the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]]. He left the Army after World War II, and later joined the [[Minnesota Air National Guard]] after working for [[Boeing]] as an [[aeronautical engineer]].  He joined the [[United States Air Force]], and attended the [[Air Force Test Pilot School]] in 1955.  In 1959, he applied to, and was selected as one of the [[Mercury Seven]]. He was scheduled to pilot the second U.S. crewed [[orbital spaceflight]], but was grounded in 1962 by [[atrial fibrillation]], an irregular heart rhythm.  In March 1972, he was medically cleared to fly and was the docking module pilot of the 1975 [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]] (ASTP). He continued to work at NASA until 1982, and helped develop the [[Space Shuttle]]. \n\nHe died from a brain tumor on June 13, 1993, aged 69.\n\n== Early life and career==\n[[File:Donald K.

From a young age, he worked on the farm to raise sheep and cows, and grow tobacco.  Throughout Slayton's childhood, his family's home did not have electricity or indoor plumbing. At the age of five, Slayton was clearing a horse-drawn hay mower when his left ring finger was severed.<ref name=\"deke!\"/>{{rp|10\u201315}} He attended a two-room elementary school in Leon, and graduated from Sparta High School in 1942, where he [[boxing|boxed]], played [[trombone]], and was active in the [[Future Farmers of America]] (FFA).<ref name=\"deke!\"/>{{rp|15\u201317}}\n\n===World War II===\nThe 1941 [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] by the [[Japanese Empire]] occurred during Slayton's senior year of high school.  He initially wished to join the [[U.S. Navy]], but joined the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] when they began accepting high school graduates to fly.<ref name=deke! />{{rp|17}}{{refn|group=note|The [[United States Navy]] required its pilots to have a college degree.}} After graduation, Slayton moved to [[San Antonio, Texas]], and entered the [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USAAF)|Aviation Cadet Training Program]].  He was initially medically delayed because of his severed ring finger, but was deemed able to fly.  Slayton began flight training in [[Vernon, Texas]], where he trained on the [[Fairchild PT-19]], the [[PT-17 Stearman]], and the [[AT-6 Texan]]. After three months of primary training, Slayton moved to [[Waco, Texas]] for basic flight training, where he flew the [[BT-13 Valiant]].  Despite Slayton's wishes to fly single-engine fighter aircraft, he was selected to fly multi-engine aircraft.  Slayton began multi-engine training on the [[Beechcraft AT-10]], Cessna AT-12, and the Curtis 18-I.  Slayton graduated from flight training on April 22, 1943, and was assigned to fly on the [[B-25 Mitchell]], his last choice for aircraft.<ref name=deke! />{{rp|18\u201322}}\n\nSlayton moved to [[Columbia Army Air Base]] in [[South Carolina]] for the three-month-long B-25 Mitchell training. After completing training, he was assigned to the [[340th Flying Training Group#World War II|340th Bombardment Group]], and departed for the [[European theatre of World War II|European theater of operations]] on ship from [[Newport News, Virginia]]. After a stop in Zerni, North Africa, his convoy travelled to [[Naples, Italy]].  While traveling near the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], their ships came under attack from German bombers and [[U-boat#World War II (1939\u20131945)|submarines]].<ref name=deke! />{{rp|23\u201324}} After he arrived in Naples, the 340th Bombardment Group moved to San Petrazio, where Slayton flew combat missions into the [[Balkan Peninsula]].  After six weeks, he moved to Foggia, where 48 aircraft were destroyed after an eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]].  Afterwards, Slayton flew out of [[Salerno]] and [[Corsica]], where he upgraded from copilot to pilot.  After 56 combat sorties, Slayton completed his combat tour and returned to the U.S. in May 1944.<ref name=deke! />{{rp|26\u201332}}\n\nImmediately upon his return to Columbia Army Air Base to serve as a B-25 instructor, Slayton applied and was accepted to fly the new [[A-26 Invader]] bomber aircraft.  He moved to [[Selfridge Field]] in [[Michigan]] for training, and began preparing for a deployment to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]].  In July 1945, he arrived on [[Okinawa Island]] and joined the [[319th Operations Group#World War II|319th Bombardment Group]].  He flew seven combat missions over [[Japan]], and encountered little Japanese resistance.  Slayton flew his final combat mission on August 12, three days after the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki#Nagasaki|bombing of Nagasaki]], and spent two months waiting for his return to the U.S.  After the war, Slayton worked as B-25 instructor in [[Albany, Georgia]] and [[Boca Raton, Florida]], and separated from the Army in November 1946.<ref name=deke! />{{rp|33\u201340}}<ref name=nmspace />\n\n===Post-World War II===\nAfter he was discharged from the Army, Slayton enrolled at the [[University of Minnesota]], in [[Minneapolis]], and studied [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineering]].

He transitioned to the [[Minnesota Air National Guard]] (ANG), after accepting a demotion from captain to second lieutenant, to allow him to fly the A-26 Invader and [[P-51 Mustang]].  He left the Minnesota ANG when he moved to Seattle.  Slayton attempted to join an Air Force Reserve unit in Seattle at the start of the [[Korean War]], but was rejected on the grounds that his inactive reserve status had expired.  He contacted his previous squadron commander in Minnesota, and accepted his offer to rejoin his former squadron in February 1951.  Upon his return, Slayton was initially medically disqualified from flying for his eyesight. He served as a maintenance officer while waiting for his medical clearance, and then became a maintenance flight test officer once he had returned to flying status.<ref name=deke! />{{rp|40\u201349}}\n\nIn 1952, Slayton transferred to active duty Air Force from the Air National Guard.  After completing his education at [[Air Command and Staff College|Air Command and Staff School]], he was assigned as a maintenance inspector at [[Twelfth Air Force]] Headquarters in [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden Army Airfield]], [[West Germany]]. He additionally served as an [[F-86 Sabre]] pilot and maintenance officer with the [[36th Wing|36th Fighter Day Wing]] at [[Bitburg Air Base]], [[West Germany]].

Despite his initial lack of interest in spaceflight, he agreed to pursue astronaut selection. After an initial interview at the temporary NASA headquarters in the [[Dolley Madison House]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], Slayton was psychologically and physically tested at the Lovelace Clinic in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], along with fellow future astronauts [[Scott Carpenter]] and [[Jim Lovell]].  On April 2, 1959, Slayton was notified of his selection as an astronaut.

Slayton chose to replace [[Ken Mattingly]] with [[Jack Swigert]] on [[Apollo 13]], after concerns arose that Mattingly could develop [[measles]] during the mission.<ref name=chaikin />{{rp|288}} In 1969, he made the controversial decision to assign Alan Shepard as the [[Apollo 13]] commander, which was viewed by some astronauts as a conflict of interest, due to Shepard's previous position as head of the astronaut office. Shepard would be later reassigned to command [[Apollo 14]], against Slayton's wishes, by the Office of Manned Spaceflight director [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]], who felt that Shepard needed additional training time.<ref name=chaikin />{{rp|346-348}}  After the [[Apollo 15 postal covers incident|postal covers scandal]] during the [[Apollo 15]] mission, Slayton reassigned the crew to non-flying jobs, effectively ending their astronaut careers.<ref name=chaikin />{{rp|496-497}} Slayton supported keeping [[Joe Engle]] as the lunar module pilot on [[Apollo 17]], but was pressured by NASA management to replace him with [[Jack Schmitt]], a scientist-astronaut.<ref name=deke! />{{rp|271}}<ref name=chaikin />{{rp|450-451}}\n\n=== Return to flight status ===\nWhile grounded, Slayton took several measures to attempt to be restored to flight status, including regularly exercising, taking vitamins, quitting cigarette smoking and coffee, and reducing his consumption of alcoholic beverages. In 1970 his palpitations became more frequent and he started taking experimental daily doses of [[quinidine]], a crystalline alkaloid. This treatment was successful, but concerned that taking medication would still disqualify him from solo flying, Slayton stopped taking it against doctors orders.<ref name=times/>  In 1971, Slayton was examined at the [[Mayo Clinic]] after a long period without heart fibrillation, and was determined to not have a coronary condition. On March 13, 1972, NASA announced that Slayton had returned to flight status.<ref name=deke! />{{rp|264, 274, 275}}\n\n=== Apollo\u2013Soyuz flight ===\n\n{{Main|Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project}}\n[[File:Astronaut Donald K.

The American crew began a two-year training program, which included learning the Russian language and making  trips to the [[Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center]] in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].

On July 17, 1975, the two craft joined up in orbit, and the American astronauts conducted crew transfers with cosmonauts [[Alexei Leonov]] and [[Valeri Kubasov]]. At the end of the flight, an erroneous switch setting led to noxious [[nitrogen tetroxide]] fumes from the command module's RCS thrusters being sucked into the cabin during landing, and the crew was hospitalized as a precaution in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], for two weeks. During hospitalization, a [[lesion]] was discovered on Slayton's lung and removed.

The ALT program developed the tests for the [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', and modified several [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|F-104 Starfighters]] and [[T-38 Talon]]s to train the astronauts.

During the selection of the [[NASA Astronaut Group 8|Group 8]] astronauts, Slayton advocated for fewer selections, with the expectation that two-man crews would fly the regular satellite deployment missions. He officially retired in 1980, but continued to serve in an advisory role for [[STS-1]], and flew a [[T-38 Talon]] chase plane during the landing of [[STS-2]].

Prior to this, the aircraft was used for two other flights on the day of the accident, operating as Flight 669 and Flight 670, flying from Bombay to Goa and back. The aircraft was an [[Airbus A320|Airbus A320-231]] registered in India as VT-EPN, carrying 139 passengers and 7 crew members, including 4 infants. The aircraft's assigned route was on route W17 from Bombay to [[Belgaum]] via Karad and W56 from Belgaum to [[Bangalore]]. The take-off phase and en route phase proceeded normally.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAt 12:53 local time, Flight 605's radar plot appeared on Bangalore's radar. Flight 605 was asked by Bangalore Radar to turn right and make a visual approach to Runway 09. The crew disengaged the autopilot and later changed to the Bangalore Tower after being transferred by Bangalore Radar.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Crash===\nWhile Flight 605 was attempting to land, the pilots flew far below the glideslope, and the landing gear touched down on the grounds of the Karnataka Golf Club, approximately 2,800&nbsp;ft from the airport. Most people on the aircraft, including some crew members, thought that the aircraft had touched down on the runway as it was similar to its normal landing. Flight 605 then bounced and shortly later impacted the ground for the second time. The impact caused several people's seat belts to fail, leading people to be thrown from their seats and hit the aircraft's floor. Flight 605 later struck a 12-ft embankment. Both the engines and landing gear detached from the aircraft. The aircraft then flew over a road and crashed into a grassy, rocky area near the airport.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Search and rescue===\nAfter the crash, a post-impact fire started and the survivors began to escape from the burning wreckage. Several people managed to get out of the plane from an opening in the aircraft's fuselage. The surviving cabin crew opened the emergency door on the airplane and began to evacuate the survivors.  92 people, consisting of 88 passengers and 4 crew, perished in the crash, while 54 survived, all with injuries. 2 people succumbed to their injuries after the accident.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, no fire service units reached the crash site as there was no RT communication facility between the tower and firefighting vehicles. A portable radio transmitter was available for communication between the tower and the aerodrome fire station, but was not serviceable on the day of the accident.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Passengers and crews==\nFlight 605 carried 139 passengers and 7 crew members, consisting of 2 cockpit crew and 5 cabin crew. There were 4 infants aboard the flight.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe pilot who controlled the flight was Indian national Captain Cyril Fernandez at 46 years old. He joined Indian Airlines in 1977 as a pilot and was promoted to the position of co-pilot. Eventually, he became Captain of a Hawker Siddeley HS 748. In 1983, Fernandez obtained a Boeing 737 co-pilot rating, followed by a Captain rating in 1984. Fernandez became the co-pilot of an Airbus A320 in 1989. Fernandez had a total flying experience of 9,307 hours, of which 68 hours were spent on the Airbus A320.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccording to the report, Captain Fernandez was under supervision as he was undergoing the first of 10 route checks required for qualification to Captain. During the flight, he was seated in the left seat.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe pilot who supervised Captain Fernandez was Indian national Captain Satish Gopujkar at 44 years old. He joined Indian Airlines in 1969 and was employed as a co-pilot on a Hawker Siddeley HS 748 from 1971\u20131981, later flying the plane as a Captain. In 1981, he obtained a Boeing 737 co-pilot rating and later, a pilot in command rating in 1983. In 1989, he was promoted as a co-pilot on an Airbus A320. Captain Gopujkar had a total flying experience of 10,340 hours, of which 255 hours were on the Airbus A320. During the flight, he was carrying out the duties of both the co-pilot and the check pilot.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBefore Flight 605, Captain Gopujkar was involved in a taxiing incident in Cochin{{which|date=July 2018}}, although he was not blamed for the incident. During Flight 605, he was seated in the right seat.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Casualties==\n92 people were killed in the crash, including Captain Gopujkar and Captain Fernandez. According to official reports: amongst the 54 injured people, at least 20 had suffered head injuries, 32 suffered lower limb injuries, while 7 sustained thoracic injuries. Details in the report revealed that most of the dead suffered major trauma during the crash. At least 81 victims were revealed to have suffered shock and burn injuries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe report then stated that several passengers may have been too injured to move, leaving them physically unable to escape from the burning wreckage. They may have survived the impact, but due to the injuries they suffered during the crash, they couldn't escape. The report stated that most people seated near the emergency exits and slides survived the crash.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs most survivors and victims of the crash suffered head and leg injuries, the investigative team stated that those injuries might have occurred to the passengers (and some of the crew) onboard as a result of the inadequate leg room. In addition, during the crash, several seats were thrust forward, causing several passengers' head to slam into the back of the seat in front of them.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Investigation==\nThe Indian Ministry of Civil Aviation ordered a full-scale investigation into the crash. The Indian [[Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (India)|AAIB]] and the Canadian [[Transportation Safety Board|TSB]] were involved in the investigation. On 19 February, investigators visited the crash site and inspected the wreckage of the aircraft. They noted that the front part of the aircraft was destroyed during its impact with the embankment. A subsequent fire led to the total destruction of the aircraft.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Initial inspection===\nInvestigators then inspected the flight controls of Flight 605, viz. the rudder, the ailerons, the trimmable horizontal stabilizer, the flaps and slats, and several other flight controls. However, they didn't find any abnormalities on these controls. Control failure was ruled out as a possible cause of the crash. According to investigators, they also ruled out terrorism as a cause of the crash, as there were no signs of an onboard explosion during the approach and there was no evidence of explosives on board.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===FDR and CVR analysis===\nAfter the discovery of the FDR and the CVR, investigators decoded and analyzed its contents.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nInvestigators made an analysis based on both flight recorders as follows:\nFlight 605 was approaching Bangalore Airport in 'open descent' mode. In this mode, the aircraft engines are at the idle throttle. People would notice this since the engines seem to turn silent, and the plane appears to be sinking bit by bit.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe crew of Flight 605 disengaged the autopilot when sighting the runway of Bangalore Airport. They later made contact with Bangalore Tower. At 01:40 pm local time, the aircraft display indicated that the plane\u2019s altitude had been just under 5000&nbsp;feet and its approach path was 600&nbsp;ft higher than the normal glide path.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCaptain Fernandez noticed this and requested for a [[go-around]]. He would climb to 6000&nbsp;ft, do another circle and come back better aligned to the normal glide path. The check pilot, Captain Gopujkar then responded to his request: \u201cDo you want a go around? Or do you want vertical speed?\u201d Captain Fernandez chose to proceed with the vertical speed option. If the pilots would have proceeded with the go-around, the emergency that was to follow could have been averted.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSince the plane was a little higher than the normal glide path, Captain Fernandez asked for a higher descent rate of 1000&nbsp;ft/min, instead of the normal rate of 700&nbsp;ft/min. This faster descent increased the aircraft speed to 275&nbsp;km/hr \u2014 higher than the recommended speed of 240&nbsp;km/hr \u2014 but it helped the aircraft regain the normal glide path. The aircraft was also now in the vertical speed mode \u2014 the correct mode for landing.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCaptain Gopujkar then checked the landing checklist. After completing the checklist, he asked the cabin crew to be seated at their stations. Realizing that the aircraft had regained its normal glide path, Captain Gopujkar reported at 01:42 that he had now selected a \u201c700 ft rate of descent\u201d. However, instead of choosing the vertical speed knob, he accidentally chose the altitude knob. So, instead of inputting an order for a 700&nbsp;ft rate of descent to the Airbus A320, he made an order to put the aircraft on an altitude of 700&nbsp;ft.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Cockpit View PR-AVP A320-214 msn 4891 (6349154954).jpg|thumb|The cockpit of an Airbus A320. The ten control knobs are shown.]]\nThe vertical speed knob and the altitude knob are located next to each other and have a similar design. This might have led to the confusion.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBecause of Captain Gopujkar's action, the aircraft went back to the 'open descent' mode, causing the throttle to be in the idle position. The absence of engine power on the aircraft led to a decrease of the aircraft's speed. The plane was falling fast. Despite the impending disaster, the crew of Flight 605 seemed to not be aware of it.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe plane's radio altimeter then sounded: \"400 ft\". This probably alerted Captain Gopujkar in some way because he suddenly observed: \u201cYou are descending on idle open descend eh, all this time!\u201d. And as the altimeter called out \u201c300 ft\u201d, Captain Gopujkar asked: \u201cYou want flight directors off now?\u201d. Captain Fernandez confirmed that his flight director had been put off, Captain Gopujkar's however, hadn't. If both the flight directors had been put off at that point, the plane would have gone to the speed mode, sensing that speed was dropping, and enough engine power could have been generated for a possible recovery even at that late stage.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe plane continued to hurtle downwards. When the plane was only 135&nbsp;ft from the ground, Captain Fernandez suddenly realized the gravity of the situation and exclaimed: \u201cHey, we\u2019re going down!\u201d. Captain Gopujkar, himself stunned now, could only respond with \u201cOh, shit!\u201d Those were his last recorded words. Captain Fernandez then ordered an immediate TOGA (Take-off Go-around). However, this action was too late. The aircraft did lift from the ground, however, it failed to clear a 12-ft embankment, which its engines and landing gear sub sequentially struck, and the aircraft crashed. Investigators stated that if this action had been taken 2 seconds earlier, the disaster could have been averted.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Court's findings===\nThe High Court of Karnataka reported that the accident was caused by the pilots failing to realize the gravity of the situation and failing to respond by immediately advancing the throttles, even after the radio altitude callouts of \u201cFour Hundred,\u201d \u201cThree Hundred\u201d and \u201cTwo Hundred\u201d feet, despite knowing that the plane was in idle/open descent mode.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Controversy==\nIndia's investigative team concluded that pilot error was the cause of the accident, which was supported by [[Airbus Industrie]]. However, the India Commercial Pilot Association (ICPA) disputed the report, claiming that a design flaw on the Airbus A320 was the cause of the crash.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/flight-1c-605-inquiry-what-caused-the-crash/1/315232.html|title=Dispute over findings|last=|first=|date=|work=India Today|access-date=27 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ICPA stated that the senior Captain of the flight, Captain Gopujkar, wouldn't have made the series of mistakes and stated that there was no proof that he made the faulty setting since the flight data recorder didn't record such mistakes. The association also believes that the engines went into idle power because of a major system defect. Even when Gopujkar tried to shut his director off, it didn't respond. They also claimed that the time lag of 0.5 seconds for the auto-thrust controls to act proved to be disastrous.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAt the time, the Airbus A320 was relatively new, having just been launched in 1988. Its main difference from other aircraft was that it used fly-by-wire (FBW) technology. In a conventional aircraft the pilot was in direct contact with the actuator; so if the pilot opened the throttle more, the actuator immediately gave the pilot more power. In the A320 however, the pilot\u2019s command is first directed to an onboard computer \u2014 and the actuator responds only when the computer determines that it is okay to do so.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBefore the crash of Flight 605, an Airbus A320 had been involved in another crash, [[Air France Flight 296]]. Official investigations determined that the cause of the crash was pilot error. However, the pilot blamed the plane's fly-by-wire system for the crash. This claim caused a major controversy about the Airbus A320.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19880626-0|title=Air France Flight 296|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ASN|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nLess than two years after the crash of Flight 605, the A320 suffered another fatal accident when [[Air Inter Flight 148]] crashed in France killing 87 people. The cause was also a [[CFIT]] like 605. The investigation of Flight 148 harshly criticized the Airbus A320's cockpit design. In response, changes were made to the Flight Control Unit panel display; the [[ Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses pour la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'Aviation Civile |French aviation safety authority]] issued 34 recommendations.<ref\n    name=          \":0\"\n/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Airblue Flight 202]] \u2013 A crash in Pakistan in which the pilot failed to pull a knob to put a heading setting into effect \n* [[Air Inter Flight 148]] \u2013 Similar crash in France involving an Airbus A320 which was caused by a design flaw on its autopilot\n* [[British European Airways Flight 548]] \u2013 Pilot retracted the aircraft's droops too early, causing a fatal deep stall\n\n==References==\n{{Portal bar|1990s|Bangalore|Aviation}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://lessonslearned.faa.gov/IndianAir605/Indian%20Airlines%20Flt%20605%20%20Accident%20Report.pdf Indian Airlines Flt 605 Accident Report] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20161222154323/http://lessonslearned.faa.gov/IndianAir605/Indian%20Airlines%20Flt%20605%20%20Accident%20Report.pdf Archive])\n*[https://www.tailstrike.com/140290.htm Cockpit voice recorder transcript and accident summary]\n{{Aviation incidents and accidents in 1990}}\n\n<br />\n\n[[Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by pilot error]]\n[[Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Airbus A320]]\n[[Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1990]]\n[[Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in India]]\n[[Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving controlled flight into terrain]]\n[[Category:Indian (airline) accidents and incidents|605]]\n[[Category:1990 disasters in India]]\n[[Category:History of Karnataka (1947\u2013present)]]\n[[Category:1990s in Bangalore]]\n[[Category:Disasters in Karnataka]]\n[[Category:February 1990 events in Asia]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2014}}\n{{Infobox aircraft occurrence\n| name = Indian Airlines Flight 605\n| occurrence_type = Accident\n| image = Indian Airlines Airbus A320 SDS-5.jpg\n| alt = \n| caption = An [[Indian Airlines]] [[Airbus A320]] similar to the one involved in the crash\n| date = {{Start date|1990|2|14|df=y}}\n| summary = [[Controlled flight into terrain]] due to pilot error\n| site = Challaghatta Valley, near Bangalore Hindustan Airport\n| coordinates = {{Coord|12.9481|N|77.6478|E|type:event|display=inline,title}}\n| aircraft_type = [[Airbus A320|Airbus A320-231]]\n| aircraft_name = \n| operator = [[Indian Airlines]]\n| tail_number = VT-EPN\n| origin = [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]], [[Mumbai|Bombay]], India\n| stopover = \n| stopover0 = \n| stopover1 = \n| stopover2 = \n| stopover3 = \n| last_stopover = \n| destination = [[HAL Bangalore Airport|Hindustan Airport]], [[Bangalore]], India\n| passengers = 139\n| crew = 7\n| injuries = 54 \n| fatalities = 92\n| missing = \n| survivors = 54\n}}\n\n'''Indian Airlines Flight 605''' was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Mumbai to [[Bengaluru]].

Details in the report revealed that most of the dead suffered major trauma during the crash. At least 81 victims were revealed to have suffered shock and burn injuries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe report then stated that several passengers may have been too injured to move, leaving them physically unable to escape from the burning wreckage. They may have survived the impact, but due to the injuries they suffered during the crash, they couldn't escape. The report stated that most people seated near the emergency exits and slides survived the crash.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs most survivors and victims of the crash suffered head and leg injuries, the investigative team stated that those injuries might have occurred to the passengers (and some of the crew) onboard as a result of the inadequate leg room. In addition, during the crash, several seats were thrust forward, causing several passengers' head to slam into the back of the seat in front of them.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Investigation==\nThe Indian Ministry of Civil Aviation ordered a full-scale investigation into the crash. The Indian [[Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (India)|AAIB]] and the Canadian [[Transportation Safety Board|TSB]] were involved in the investigation. On 19 February, investigators visited the crash site and inspected the wreckage of the aircraft. They noted that the front part of the aircraft was destroyed during its impact with the embankment. A subsequent fire led to the total destruction of the aircraft.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Initial inspection===\nInvestigators then inspected the flight controls of Flight 605, viz. the rudder, the ailerons, the trimmable horizontal stabilizer, the flaps and slats, and several other flight controls. However, they didn't find any abnormalities on these controls. Control failure was ruled out as a possible cause of the crash. According to investigators, they also ruled out terrorism as a cause of the crash, as there were no signs of an onboard explosion during the approach and there was no evidence of explosives on board.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===FDR and CVR analysis===\nAfter the discovery of the FDR and the CVR, investigators decoded and analyzed its contents.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nInvestigators made an analysis based on both flight recorders as follows:\nFlight 605 was approaching Bangalore Airport in 'open descent' mode. In this mode, the aircraft engines are at the idle throttle. People would notice this since the engines seem to turn silent, and the plane appears to be sinking bit by bit.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe crew of Flight 605 disengaged the autopilot when sighting the runway of Bangalore Airport. They later made contact with Bangalore Tower. At 01:40 pm local time, the aircraft display indicated that the plane\u2019s altitude had been just under 5000&nbsp;feet and its approach path was 600&nbsp;ft higher than the normal glide path.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCaptain Fernandez noticed this and requested for a [[go-around]]. He would climb to 6000&nbsp;ft, do another circle and come back better aligned to the normal glide path. The check pilot, Captain Gopujkar then responded to his request: \u201cDo you want a go around? Or do you want vertical speed?\u201d Captain Fernandez chose to proceed with the vertical speed option. If the pilots would have proceeded with the go-around, the emergency that was to follow could have been averted.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSince the plane was a little higher than the normal glide path, Captain Fernandez asked for a higher descent rate of 1000&nbsp;ft/min, instead of the normal rate of 700&nbsp;ft/min. This faster descent increased the aircraft speed to 275&nbsp;km/hr \u2014 higher than the recommended speed of 240&nbsp;km/hr \u2014 but it helped the aircraft regain the normal glide path. The aircraft was also now in the vertical speed mode \u2014 the correct mode for landing.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nCaptain Gopujkar then checked the landing checklist. After completing the checklist, he asked the cabin crew to be seated at their stations. Realizing that the aircraft had regained its normal glide path, Captain Gopujkar reported at 01:42 that he had now selected a \u201c700 ft rate of descent\u201d. However, instead of choosing the vertical speed knob, he accidentally chose the altitude knob. So, instead of inputting an order for a 700&nbsp;ft rate of descent to the Airbus A320, he made an order to put the aircraft on an altitude of 700&nbsp;ft.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Cockpit View PR-AVP A320-214 msn 4891 (6349154954).jpg|thumb|The cockpit of an Airbus A320. The ten control knobs are shown.]]\nThe vertical speed knob and the altitude knob are located next to each other and have a similar design. This might have led to the confusion.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBecause of Captain Gopujkar's action, the aircraft went back to the 'open descent' mode, causing the throttle to be in the idle position. The absence of engine power on the aircraft led to a decrease of the aircraft's speed. The plane was falling fast. Despite the impending disaster, the crew of Flight 605 seemed to not be aware of it.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe plane's radio altimeter then sounded: \"400 ft\". This probably alerted Captain Gopujkar in some way because he suddenly observed: \u201cYou are descending on idle open descend eh, all this time!\u201d. And as the altimeter called out \u201c300 ft\u201d, Captain Gopujkar asked: \u201cYou want flight directors off now?\u201d. Captain Fernandez confirmed that his flight director had been put off, Captain Gopujkar's however, hadn't. If both the flight directors had been put off at that point, the plane would have gone to the speed mode, sensing that speed was dropping, and enough engine power could have been generated for a possible recovery even at that late stage.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe plane continued to hurtle downwards. When the plane was only 135&nbsp;ft from the ground, Captain Fernandez suddenly realized the gravity of the situation and exclaimed: \u201cHey, we\u2019re going down!\u201d. Captain Gopujkar, himself stunned now, could only respond with \u201cOh, shit!\u201d Those were his last recorded words. Captain Fernandez then ordered an immediate TOGA (Take-off Go-around). However, this action was too late. The aircraft did lift from the ground, however, it failed to clear a 12-ft embankment, which its engines and landing gear sub sequentially struck, and the aircraft crashed. Investigators stated that if this action had been taken 2 seconds earlier, the disaster could have been averted.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Court's findings===\nThe High Court of Karnataka reported that the accident was caused by the pilots failing to realize the gravity of the situation and failing to respond by immediately advancing the throttles, even after the radio altitude callouts of \u201cFour Hundred,\u201d \u201cThree Hundred\u201d and \u201cTwo Hundred\u201d feet, despite knowing that the plane was in idle/open descent mode.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Controversy==\nIndia's investigative team concluded that pilot error was the cause of the accident, which was supported by [[Airbus Industrie]]. However, the India Commercial Pilot Association (ICPA) disputed the report, claiming that a design flaw on the Airbus A320 was the cause of the crash.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/flight-1c-605-inquiry-what-caused-the-crash/1/315232.html|title=Dispute over findings|last=|first=|date=|work=India Today|access-date=27 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ICPA stated that the senior Captain of the flight, Captain Gopujkar, wouldn't have made the series of mistakes and stated that there was no proof that he made the faulty setting since the flight data recorder didn't record such mistakes. The association also believes that the engines went into idle power because of a major system defect. Even when Gopujkar tried to shut his director off, it didn't respond. They also claimed that the time lag of 0.5 seconds for the auto-thrust controls to act proved to be disastrous.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAt the time, the Airbus A320 was relatively new, having just been launched in 1988. Its main difference from other aircraft was that it used fly-by-wire (FBW) technology. In a conventional aircraft the pilot was in direct contact with the actuator; so if the pilot opened the throttle more, the actuator immediately gave the pilot more power. In the A320 however, the pilot\u2019s command is first directed to an onboard computer \u2014 and the actuator responds only when the computer determines that it is okay to do so.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBefore the crash of Flight 605, an Airbus A320 had been involved in another crash, [[Air France Flight 296]]. Official investigations determined that the cause of the crash was pilot error. However, the pilot blamed the plane's fly-by-wire system for the crash. This claim caused a major controversy about the Airbus A320.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19880626-0|title=Air France Flight 296|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=ASN|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nLess than two years after the crash of Flight 605, the A320 suffered another fatal accident when [[Air Inter Flight 148]] crashed in France killing 87 people. The cause was also a [[CFIT]] like 605. The investigation of Flight 148 harshly criticized the Airbus A320's cockpit design. In response, changes were made to the Flight Control Unit panel display; the [[ Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses pour la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'Aviation Civile |French aviation safety authority]] issued 34 recommendations.<ref\n    name=          \":0\"\n/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Airblue Flight 202]] \u2013 A crash in Pakistan in which the pilot failed to pull a knob to put a heading setting into effect \n* [[Air Inter Flight 148]] \u2013 Similar crash in France involving an Airbus A320 which was caused by a design flaw on its autopilot\n* [[British European Airways Flight 548]] \u2013 Pilot retracted the aircraft's droops too early, causing a fatal deep stall\n\n==References==\n{{Portal bar|1990s|Bangalore|Aviation}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://lessonslearned.faa.gov/IndianAir605/Indian%20Airlines%20Flt%20605%20%20Accident%20Report.pdf Indian Airlines Flt 605 Accident Report] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20161222154323/http://lessonslearned.faa.gov/IndianAir605/Indian%20Airlines%20Flt%20605%20%20Accident%20Report.pdf Archive])\n*[https://www.tailstrike.com/140290.htm Cockpit voice recorder transcript and accident summary]\n{{Aviation incidents and accidents in 1990}}\n\n<br />\n\n[[Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by pilot error]]\n[[Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Airbus A320]]\n[[Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1990]]\n[[Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in India]]\n[[Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving controlled flight into terrain]]\n[[Category:Indian (airline) accidents and incidents|605]]\n[[Category:1990 disasters in India]]\n[[Category:History of Karnataka (1947\u2013present)]]\n[[Category:1990s in Bangalore]]\n[[Category:Disasters in Karnataka]]\n[[Category:February 1990 events in Asia]]\n", "name_user": "Why can't I edit Userpedia?", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added in information for the info-box.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Airlines_Flight_605"}
