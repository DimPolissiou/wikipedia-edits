It is situated on the [[Bengaluru]] - [[Chennai]] [[National Highway 75 (India)|National Highway-75]].\n\nKolar is also The gateway for [[Tirumala]] and [[Chennai]] via [[National Highway 75]]\n\n==History of Kolar==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\nThe [[Western Gangas]] sovereignty lasted from about 350 to 550 CE, initially ruled from Kolar as their Capital City. The founder of the Western Ganga dynasty was Konganivarman Madhava, who built Kolar as his capital around 350 and ruled for about twenty years. He succeeded by his son Madhava I. Kolar, the headquarters of the [[Kolar district]], was earlier known as Kuvalalapura, also known as Kolahala Pura. Historically, Kolar is said to be associated with the epic age, which recalls many legends associated with Avani in [[Mulbagal]] Taluk, which was also called Avani Kshetra.\n\nIt was once known as Avantika- Kshetra, a sacred place in [[Kolar district]] in Karnataka State. It was famous for its religious establishments from ancient times. It was once known as Aavanya which was under the Ganga prince Madhava Muttarasa, who governed several districts. In about A.D 890, its earliest grant relates that Tribhuvana Kartara Deva, who held the title of Kali Yuga Rudra, ruled over the Avaniya Thana for 40 years. During this period he constructed 50 temples and two large tanks. Maharshi Valmiki, author of the epic [[Ramayana]], lived here. The legend goes further to establish that Seetha Devi, after being sent to exile, gave birth to her twins Lava and Kusha at Avani. The Avani continued to survive as a religious establishment from the 9th to 11th centuries. There are temples dedicated to Lord Rama.\n\nThe hill to the west of Kolar, called the ''Shatasringa Parvata'' or 'Hundred-Peaked Mountain' is 'Antharagange', associated with the story of Parasurama and his fight with King Kartaviryarjuna over Surabhi, the divine cow. As the story goes, King Kartavirya Arjuna (Sahasrarjuna) and his army visited Jamadagni, Parasurama's father, when the king demanded the magical cow from Jamadagni. When Jamadagni refused, the King sent his soldiers to take the cow, but Parashurama killed the entire army and the king with his axe. In return, the princes beheaded Jamadagni. Thus, Parasurama took an oath to behead the entire Kshatriya race, which is said to have taken place on the hills. It is said that the 'kolahala' on the death of Kartaviryarjuna gave its name to the town, which later become Kolar. [[Kannada language|Kannada]] is widely spoken. Gangas built the temple of Sri Uttameshwara temple in '' [[Uttanur]]''  Mulbagal Talluk.\n\nAntaragange is one of the tourist attractions Of Kolar. It is also known as \"Dakshina Kashi Kshetra\".

Located in [[Anuak Zone]], at the confluence of the [[Baro River]] and its tributary the Jajjaba, the city has a latitude and longitude of {{coord|8|15|N|34|35|E|display=inline,title}} and an elevation of 526 meters.

The [[Anuak people|Anuak]] and [[Nuer people|Nuer]] inhabitants of Gambela each have their own [[market (place)|market]]. The town also boasts an [[Gambela Airport|airport]] ([[ICAO]] code HAGM, [[IATA]] GMB) and is near the [[Gambela National Park]].\n\n== History ==\nGambela was founded because of its location on the Baro, a tributary of the [[Nile]], which was seen by both the [[United Kingdom|British]] and Ethiopia as an excellent highway for exporting [[Coffee production in Ethiopia|coffee]] and other goods from the fertile [[Ethiopian Highlands]] to [[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]]. \n\n=== British Concession (1902-1956) === \nEmperor [[Menelik II of Ethiopia]] granted Britain use of a port along the Baro May 15, 1902, and in 1907 the port and a [[customs (tax)|customs station]] were founded at Gambela.\n\nA shipping service run by [[Sudan Railways]] linked [[Khartoum]] with Gambela, a distance of 1,366 kilometers. According to [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]], by the mid-1930s boats sailed twice a month during the [[rainy season]], taking seven days downstream and eleven upstream.<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''An Economic History of Ethiopia'' (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie University Press, 1968), p. 304</ref>\n\nAccording to Bahru Zewde, British interest in the concession was due, in part, to the attraction of ' ''tapping the allegedly fabulous commercial potential of Western Ethiopia and drawing the whole region into the economic orbit of the Sudan'' ', but also intended ' ''to be a brilliant British countermove to avert the virtual commercial hegemony in Ethiopia that the [[Imperial Railway Company of Ethiopia|Jibouti-Addis Ababa Railway]] seemed to promise the French.'' ' In fact it benefitted the [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinians]] themselves not to have their economy at the control of a single European power, whether French or British or even Italian, and Menelik was playing a wise game of playing  his colonial neighbours against each other, to avoid any single one gaining a monopoly, whilst opening his country to the benefits of trade and technology, as part of a major programme of modernisation. Although over 70% of Ethiopia's external trade passed through the port at [[Djibouti]] between 1911 and 1917, the share of goods passing through Gambela had the fastest rate of growth until the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian conquest]]. \n\nThe British did have to cope with the Ethiopian governors of [[Dembidolo|Sayo]] and [[Gore, Ethiopia|Gore]], who showed a keen interest in the money to be made in the cross-border trade.<ref>Bahru Zewde, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/219279 \"An Overview and Assessment of Gambella Trade (1904-1935)\", ''International Journal of African Historical Studies''], '''20''' (1987), pp. 75-94</ref> A small detachment of troops from the nominal [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]] was posted to Gambela to maintain order and security within the concession and defend it from outside interests in what was still a largely lawless country, following numerous Egyptian, Islamist, British and Italian interventions, and a consequent breakdown of civil authority, over the previous decades.\n\nThe Regent ''Ras'' Tafari (the later Emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]]), beginning on 9 July 1927, granted a number of concessions to T. Zervos and A. Danalis to construct a road 180 kilometers in length to connect Gambela with the towns of [[Metu, Ethiopia|Metu]] and Gore.<ref>Pankhurst, ''Economic History'', pp. 290f</ref>\n\nThe British Concession was not directly affected by the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 but when [[Italian East Africa]] was formally established in 1936, the Ethiopian concession was deemed to have lapsed. The shipping service suspended and the steamer, together with the British resident, left Gambela on 14 October. With the river traffic now gone, the Italians provided an alternative link for the town, by building a further road from Gambela, this one to [[Nekemte]], between 1936 and 1940. Gambela was taken from the Italians by the 2/6 [[King's African Rifles]] on 3 February 1941.<ref name=NAI-web>[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/g/ORTGAM.pdf \"Local History in Ethiopia\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227155026/http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/g/ORTGAM.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }} The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 29 January 2008)</ref> The property of the British buildings were reported to have been respected and left intact during the peacetime and wartime Italian administration. The original Resident returned, but the Concession was no longer distinctive, as the whole country remained under British administration, the [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration (Ethiopia)|Occupied Enemy Territory Administration]] (OETA), for a number of years, until sufficient Ethiopian administrators had been trained. \n\nLij Tewodros, a son of [[Iyasu V of Ethiopia|Lij Iyasu]], surfaced in the Gambela area in May 1941 proclaiming himself Emperor. His insurrection was put down by [[Free Belgian Forces#Belgian colonial troops in Africa|Belgian Congo]] troops before they left the area in February 1942.<ref name=NAI-web/>\n\nA new Anglo-Ethiopian treaty was signed on 19 December 1944 which virtually eliminated British privileges, but the Gambela enclave continued. The Ethiopian government gradually increased its control over the enclave: outlawing the [[Maria Theresa Thaler]] as legal tender, requiring all merchants to obtain passports in person in [[Addis Ababa]], and in 1951 informing the British resident, Captain Dribble, that he could no longer judge or imprison anyone. When he departed on 30 October 1954, the end of the enclave was in sight. The enclave was still held by the Sudanese when they achieved independence, but they did not agree to hand the enclave back to Ethiopia until 15 October 1956.<ref name=NAI-web/>\n\n=== Recent history ===\nThe port was closed during the [[Derg]] era, and {{As of|2005|lc=on}} it remains closed due to tension between the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] and the Ethiopian government, though there are hopes to reopen the port.\n\nThe [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] announced on 27 May 1991 that they had gained control of Gambela.<ref name=NAI-web/>\n\nOn 13 December 2003, in an apparent reprisal for a series of ambushes of highlander civilians, 30 Ethiopian soldiers and highlander civilians launched a brutal attack on Gambela's Anuak population.

Although over 70% of Ethiopia's external trade passed through the port at [[Djibouti]] between 1911 and 1917, the share of goods passing through Gambela had the fastest rate of growth until the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian conquest]]. \n\nThe British did have to cope with the Ethiopian governors of [[Dembidolo|Sayo]] and [[Gore, Ethiopia|Gore]], who showed a keen interest in the money to be made in the cross-border trade.<ref>Bahru Zewde, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/219279 \"An Overview and Assessment of Gambella Trade (1904-1935)\", ''International Journal of African Historical Studies''], '''20''' (1987), pp. 75-94</ref> A small detachment of troops from the nominal [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]] was posted to Gambela to maintain order and security within the concession and defend it from outside interests in what was still a largely lawless country, following numerous Egyptian, Islamist, British and Italian interventions, and a consequent breakdown of civil authority, over the previous decades.\n\nThe Regent ''Ras'' Tafari (the later Emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]]), beginning on 9 July 1927, granted a number of concessions to T. Zervos and A. Danalis to construct a road 180 kilometers in length to connect Gambela with the towns of [[Metu, Ethiopia|Metu]] and Gore.<ref>Pankhurst, ''Economic History'', pp. 290f</ref>\n\nThe British Concession was not directly affected by the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 but when [[Italian East Africa]] was formally established in 1936, the Ethiopian concession was deemed to have lapsed. The shipping service suspended and the steamer, together with the British resident, left Gambela on 14 October. With the river traffic now gone, the Italians provided an alternative link for the town, by building a further road from Gambela, this one to [[Nekemte]], between 1936 and 1940. Gambela was taken from the Italians by the 2/6 [[King's African Rifles]] on 3 February 1941.<ref name=NAI-web>[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/g/ORTGAM.pdf \"Local History in Ethiopia\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227155026/http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/g/ORTGAM.pdf |date=2008-02-27 }} The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 29 January 2008)</ref> The property of the British buildings were reported to have been respected and left intact during the peacetime and wartime Italian administration. The original Resident returned, but the Concession was no longer distinctive, as the whole country remained under British administration, the [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration]] (OETA), for a number of years, until sufficient Ethiopian administrators had been trained. \n\nLij Tewodros, a son of [[Iyasu V of Ethiopia|Lij Iyasu]], surfaced in the Gambela area in May 1941 proclaiming himself Emperor. His insurrection was put down by [[Free Belgian Forces#Belgian colonial troops in Africa|Belgian Congo]] troops before they left the area in February 1942.<ref name=NAI-web/>\n\nA new Anglo-Ethiopian treaty was signed on 19 December 1944 which virtually eliminated British privileges, but the Gambela enclave continued. The Ethiopian government gradually increased its control over the enclave: outlawing the [[Maria Theresa Thaler]] as legal tender, requiring all merchants to obtain passports in person in [[Addis Ababa]], and in 1951 informing the British resident, Captain Dribble, that he could no longer judge or imprison anyone. When he departed 30 October 1954, the end of the enclave was in sight. The enclave was still held by the Sudanese when they achieved independence, but they did not agree to hand the enclave back to Ethiopia until 15 October 1956.<ref name=NAI-web/> \n\n=== Recent history ===\nThe port was closed during the [[Derg]] era, and {{As of|2005|lc=on}} it remains closed due to tension between the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] and the Ethiopian government, though there are hopes to reopen the port.\n\nThe [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] announced on 27 May 1991 that they had gained control of Gambela.<ref name=NAI-web/>\n\nOn 13 December 2003, in an apparent reprisal for a series of ambushes of highlander civilians, 30 Ethiopian soldiers and highlander civilians launched a brutal attack on Gambela's Anuak population.
