SIR M QASIM SB.\n\nDEPT OF ENGLISH SBBU SHERINGAL \n{{Muhammad}}\nThe [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] was born and lived in Mecca for the first 52 years of his life (570\u2013632 CE). Orphaned early in life, he became known as a prominent merchant, and as an impartial and trustworthy arbiter of disputes.<ref>Watt (1974), p. 7.</ref> He married his first wife, the wealthy 40-year-old widow [[Khadijah bint Khuwaylid|Khadijah]] at the age of 25. He would also marry [[Aisha]] and many others later in his life.\n{{Islamic prophets|Events}}\nAccording to [[Islam]]ic tradition, Muhammad began receiving revelations at the age of 40; some of his peers respected his words and became his followers, while others, including tribal leaders, opposed, ridiculed and eventually boycotted his clan, and Muhammad and his followers were killed, tortured, harassed, assaulted and forced into exile.<ref>\n*Watt (1964) p. 76;\n*Peters (1999) p. 172\n*Michael Cook, ''Muhammad.''

E. Peters, ''The Quest for Historical Muhammad'', [[International Journal of Middle East Studies]] (1991) pp. 291\u2013315.</ref> The Qur'an, however, mainly records the ideological and spiritual considerations of Muhammad, and only fragmentary references to the details of Muhammad's life in Mecca, which makes it difficult to reconstruct the chronological order of the incidents in his or his followers' lives in Mecca.<ref name=\"Watt-Mecca-xv\"/> Modern biographers of Muhammad try to reconstruct the economic, political and social aspects of Mecca and read the ideological aspects of the Qur'an in that context.<ref name=\"Watt-Mecca-xv\">William Montgomery Watt, Muhammad in Mecca, p.xv</ref>\n\nThe historical works by later Muslim writers include the traditional Muslim biographies of Muhammad and quotes attributed to him (the [[Sirah Rasul Allah|sira]] and [[hadith]] literature), which provide further information on his life.<ref name=\"Reeves\">Reeves (2003), pp. 6\u20137</ref> The earliest surviving written [[Sirah Rasul Allah|sira]] (biographies of Muhammad and quotes attributed to him) is ''[[Sirah Rasul Allah]]'' (''Life of God's Messenger'') by [[Ibn Ishaq]] (died 761 or 767 CE<ref>Robinson (2003), p. xv</ref>). Although the original work is lost, portions of it survive in the recensions of [[Ibn Hisham]] (died 833 CE) and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Al-Tabari]] (died 923 CE).<ref>Donner (1998), p. 132</ref> Many, but not all, scholars accept the accuracy of these biographies, though their accuracy is unascertainable.<ref name=\"Nigosian6\">''Islam'', S. A. Nigosian, p. 6 , [[Indiana University|Indiana University Press]]</ref> [[Henri Lammens]] rejected all the accounts of Muhammad's life in Mecca but later scholars generally agree that Lammens went too far.<ref name=\"Watt-Mecca-xv\"/> Studies by J. Schacht and Goldziher has led scholars to distinguish between the traditions touching legal matters and the purely historical ones. According to [[William Montgomery Watt]], in the legal sphere it would seem that sheer invention could have very well happened. In the historical sphere, however, aside from exceptional cases, the material may have been subject to \"tendential shaping\" rather than being made out of whole cloth.<ref name=\"Watt-Mecca-xv\"/>\n\nHadith compilations are records of the traditions or sayings of Muhammad. It might be defined as the biography of Muhammad perpetuated by the long memory of his companions and community for their exemplification and obedience. The development of hadiths is a vital element during the first three centuries of Islamic history.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Cragg |first=Albert Kenneth | authorlink=Albert Kenneth Cragg | title=Hadith | encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online | accessdate=2008-03-30 |location=|publisher= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9105855/Hadith}}</ref>\nThere had been a common tendency among the earlier western scholars against these narrations and reports gathered in later periods, such scholars regarding them as later fabrications. [[Leone Caetani]] considered the attribution of historical reports to [[Ibn Abbas]] and [[Aysha]] as mostly fictitious while proffering accounts reported without ''[[isnad]]'' by the early compilers of history like [[Ibn Ishaq]]. [[Wilferd Madelung]] has rejected the stance of indiscriminately dismissing everything not included in \"early sources\" and in this approach tendentiousness alone is no evidence for late origin.

[[Imam Bukhari]], the author of the book is said to have spent over 16 years gathering over 1,600,000 traditions and finding the best 7,397 of them. Most of these traditions deal with the life of Muhammad.<ref>Jonathan Bloom, Sheila Blair, ''Islam: A Thousand Years of Faith and Power'', Yale University Press, p.55</ref>\n;Shia Islam\nFor Shi'is, the words and deeds of their Imams, who are also progeny of Muhammad, is authoritative. These were originally oral but were written down after several generations. Some of these sayings, according to their chain of transmission, are sayings of Muhammad as transmitted through the Shi'i' Imams.<ref>Moojan Momen, An Introduction to Shi`i Islam: The History and Doctrines of Twelver, Yale University Press, 1985, {{ISBN|0-300-03531-4}}, p.174</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Map of Arabia 600 AD.svg|thumb|right|180px|Approximate locations of some of the important tribes and Empire of the Arabian Peninsula at the dawn of Islam (approximately 600 CE / 50 BH).]]\nThe Arabian Peninsula was largely arid and volcanic, making agriculture difficult except near oases or springs. Thus the Arabian landscape was dotted with towns and cities near those oases, two prominent of which were Mecca and Medina (then known as Yathrib).<ref name=\"Muhammad-Mecca-12\">Watt (1953), pp.1\u20132</ref> Communal life was essential for survival in desert conditions, as people needed support against the harsh environment and lifestyle. The tribal grouping was thus encouraged by the need to act as a unit. This unity was based on the bond of kinship by blood.<ref>Watt (1953), pp. 16\u201318</ref> People of Arabia were either nomadic or sedentary, the former constantly traveling from one place to another seeking water and pasture for their flocks, while the latter settled and focused on trade and agriculture. The survival of nomads (or [[bedouins]]) was also partially dependent on raiding caravans or oases; thus they saw this as no crime.<ref name=\"Rue\">Loyal Rue, ''Religion Is Not about God: How Spiritual Traditions Nurture Our Biological'',2005, p.224</ref><ref name=\"Esposito4\">John Esposito, ''Islam'', Expanded edition, Oxford University Press, p.4-5</ref> Medina was a large flourishing agricultural settlement, while Mecca was an important financial center for many of the surrounding tribes.<ref name=\"Muhammad-Mecca-12\"/>\n\nIn pre-Islamic Arabia gods or goddesses were viewed as protectors of individual tribes and their spirits were associated with sacred trees, stones, springs and wells. There was an important shrine in Mecca (called the [[Kaaba]]) that housed statues of 360 idols of tribal patron deities and was the site of an annual pilgrimage. Aside from these tribal gods, Arabs shared a common belief in a supreme deity Allah (akin to \"God\" in English, as opposed to \"god\") who was however remote from their everyday concerns and thus not the object of cult or ritual. Three goddesses were associated with Allah as his daughters: [[Al-l\u0101t|al-Lat]], [[Man\u0101t|Manat]] and [[al-Uzza]]. Some monotheistic communities also existed in Arabia, including Christians and Jews.<ref>See:\n*Esposito, ''Islam'', Extended Edition, Oxford University Press, pp.5\u20137\n*Qur'an 3:95</ref><ref>[[Hanif]]s \u2013 native pre-Islamic Arab monotheists \u2013 are also sometimes listed alongside Jews and Christians in pre-Islamic Arabia, although their historicity is disputed amongst scholars cf.

According to traditional accounts, Muhammad was very close to his grandfather, as had been his father before him. However, two years later, his grandfather died.<ref>Peterson (2006), pp. 38 and 39</ref> Muhammad then came under the care of his uncle [[Abu Talib ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib|Abu Talib]], the new leader of the [[Hashim ibn Abd al-Manaf|Hashim]] clan of the Quraysh tribe.<ref name=\"Watt7\"/> In 6th-century Arabia, there was general disdain for guardians who took care of the weaker members of the tribes in Mecca.

His uncle also took him on many commercial journeys.

According to one version, those were the [[stigmata]] that Bahira found on young Muhammad. Other variants of the story say that it was a miraculous movement of a cloud or an unusual behavior of a branch that kept shadowing Muhammad regardless of the time of the day. The monk revealed his visions of Muhammad's future to the boy's companion, warning him to preserve the child from the [[Jew]]s (in Ibn Sa'd's version) or from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] (in al-Tabari's version).<ref name=\"Bahira\">Abel, A. \"Ba\u1e25\u012br\u0101\". ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''. Brill. Brill Online, 2007</ref>\n\n==Merchant==\n{{see also|Hilf al-Fudul}}\nAs an orphan, Muhammed had few options when it came to making a living. He was obliged to help support other members of his family and so after accompanying his uncle on trading journeys to [[Syria]], he became a merchant and was involved in trade between the Indian Ocean and the [[Mediterranean Sea]].<ref name=\"Watt8\"/><ref>Ramadan (2007), p. 19</ref><ref name=\"BerkWorldHistory\">''Berkshire Encyclopedia of World History'' (2005), v.3, p.1025</ref> He became known as \"Al-Amin\" (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0646), meaning \"Trustworthy\" and was sought out as an impartial arbitrator of disputes.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/><ref name=\"EncWorldHistory\">''Encyclopedia of World History'' (1998), p.452</ref><ref>Esposito(1998), p.6</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\n{{see also|Genealogy of Khadijah's daughters}}\n[[Khadijah bint Khuwaylid]], a widow merchant at Mecca, heard about Muhammad, and asked him to manage her commercial operations in Syria. When Muhammad returned from an extraordinarily successful commercial trip, Khadija proposed to him through her friend Nafisa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/glance-life-holy-prophet-islam-dar-rah-haqq/chapter-4-prophet%E2%80%99s-first-marriage|title=Chapter 4: The Prophet\u2019s first Marriage|website=Al-Islam.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref><ref name=\"BerkWorldHistory\"/> Tradition reports that Khadija was forty years old.\n\nMuhammad consented to the marriage, which by all accounts was a happy one. Khadija was not only Muhammad's wife, but also his friend and confidante and later his moral support. After his wedding, Khadija gave Muhammad the slave boy [[Zayd ibn Harithah]].<ref>Peterson (2006), p. 45</ref> [[Ibn Ishaq]] records that Khadijah bore Muhammad six children: a boy named [[Qasim ibn Muhammad|Qasim]], who lived only two years, then four girls [[Zainab bint Muhammad|Zaynab]], [[Ruqayyah bint Muhammad|Ruqayyah]], [[Umm Kulthum bint Muhammad|Um Kulthum]], [[Fatima Zahra|Fatimah]] and finally a boy named Abdullah, who also died at two.<ref name =R22>Ramadan (2007), p. 22-4</ref> The combination of the death of Abdullah, and his desire to relieve his uncle Abu Talib of the burden of a large family, as Abu Talib was already in great financial difficulty, led Muhammad to take his uncle's son [[Ali]] into his own home. Muhammad also adopted Zayd, giving him the name \"Zayd ibn Muhammad\" (meaning Zayd son of Muhammad). However, owing to the adoption revelation from Allah, later verses were revealed stating clearly that a child, especially after adoption, could not be treated as a natural son by marriage or inheritance. Consequently, the adopted child had to retain the name of his or her biological father. Therefore, Zayd could not be known as the son of Muhammad, but the son of his father, Haritha, and be known as Zayd ibn Haritha. In Quran 33:40 it says: ''40. Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of All\u00e2h and the last of the Prophets. And All\u00e2h is Ever All-Aware of everything. ''<ref name = R22/>\n\n===Restoration of Kaaba===\nAccording to tradition, Muhammad played a role in the restoration of the [[Kaaba]], after parts of it had been destroyed by one of Mecca's frequent [[flash flood]]s.<ref>F.E.Peters(2003), p. 54</ref> When the reconstruction was almost done, disagreements arose among the clan leaders as to who would have the honor of lifting the sacred [[Black Stone]] into place. The disagreements increased to the point where the clans were about to take up arm against each other, when one of the elders suggested they take the advice of the next person who entered the gates of the [[Haram]]. This happened to be Muhammad. He spread out his cloak, put the stone in the middle and had members of the four major clans raise it to its destined position. Then he took it in his own hands and fitted it in its place. The cloak became an important symbol for later poets and writers<ref>Jonathan M. Bloom, Sheila S. Blair (2002), p. 28-29</ref> because of this event and what happened later as described in the [[Ahl al-Kisa|Hadith of the Cloak]].\n\n==The Beginnings of the Qur'an==\n{{Quran}}\n{{main|Muhammad's first revelation}}\n{{see also|Wahy}}\nAt some point Muhammad adopted the practice of meditating alone for several weeks every year in a cave on [[Cave of Hira|Mount Hira]] near Mecca.<ref>Emory C. Bogle(1998), p.6</ref><ref>John Henry Haaren, Addison B. Poland(1904), p.83</ref> Islamic tradition holds that in one of his visits to Mount Hira, the angel [[Gabriel]] began communicating with him in the year 610 and commanded Muhammad to recite the following verses of Surah Alaq, the 96th Surah of the Quran:<ref>Brown (2003), pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n<blockquote>Proclaim! (or read!) in the name of thy Lord and Cherisher, Who created- Created man, out of a (mere) clot of congealed blood: Proclaim! And thy Lord is Most Bountiful,- He Who taught (the use of) the pen,- Taught man that which he knew not.(Qur'an {{cite quran|96|1\u20135|style=nosup|expand=no}})</blockquote>\n\nAccording to some traditions, upon receiving his first revelations Muhammad was deeply distressed, but the spirit moved closer and told him that he had been chosen as a messenger of God. Muhammad returned home and was consoled and reassured by his wife Khadijah and her Christian cousin, [[Waraqah ibn Nawfal]]. Shia tradition, on the other hand, maintains that Muhammad was neither surprised nor frightened at the appearance of Gabriel but rather welcomed him as if he had been expecting him.<ref>\n*Emory C. Bogle (1998), p.7\n*Razwy (1996), ch. 9\n*Rodinson (2002), p. 71.</ref> The initial revelation was followed by a pause of three years during which Muhammad gave himself up further to prayers and [[spiritual practice]]s. When the revelations resumed he was reassured and commanded to begin preaching: Your lord has not forsaken you nor does he hate [you] (Qur'an {{cite quran|93|1\u201311|style=nosup|expand=no}}).<ref>Brown (2003), pp. 73\u201374</ref><ref>Uri Rubin, ''Muhammad'', [[Encyclopedia of the Quran]]</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Alford T. Welch|Welch]] these revelations were accompanied by mysterious seizures, and the reports are unlikely to have been forged by later Muslims.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/> Muhammad was confident that he could distinguish his own thoughts from these messages.<ref>Watt, ''The Cambridge History of Islam'' (1977), p. 31.</ref>\n\n===Mission===\n\nMuhammad's mission involves preaching [[monotheism]]. The Qur'an demands Muhammad to proclaim and praise the name of [[Allah|his Lord]] and instructs him not to worship idols or associate other deities with God but to only worship the [[Islamic concept of God| one God]].<ref name=\"EoQ-Muhammad\"/> According to the Qur'an, one of the main roles of Muhammad is to warn the unbelievers of their eschatological punishment (Qur'an {{cite quran|38|70|style=nosup|expand=no}}, Qur'an {{cite quran|6|19|style=nosup|expand=no}}). Sometimes the Qur'an does not explicitly refer to the Judgement Day but also provides examples from the history of some extinct communities and warns Muhammad's contemporaries of similar calamities (Qur'an {{cite quran|41|13|end=16|style=nosup|expand=no}}).<ref name=\"EoQ-Muhammad\">Uri Rubin, ''Muhammad'', [[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]]</ref>\n\n====Early preaching====\nMuhammad first told about his message to his wife, his cousin Ali, his adopted son Zayd, his nursemaid [[Um Ayman]] and his friend [[Abu Bakr]], all of whom accepted it. Abu Bakr, who used to purchase slaves to set them free in accordance with Muhammad's principle of equality, attracted a large number of converts. Nevertheless, the converts remained small, and Muhammad concentrated on quietly building a small, but spiritually strong, community.<ref name = R37>Ramadan (2007), p. 37-9</ref>\n\nAround 613, the Qur'an then commanded Muhammad to \"admonish your nearest kinsmen\" ({{cite quran|26|214|style=ref}}), initiating the phase of public preaching. One day he climbed [[Mount as-Safa]], and called out the tribal chiefs. After receiving assurances that the chiefs, who reportedly never heard Muhammad tell lies, would believe him, he declared the [[Tawhid|Oneness of God]]. Later Muhammad [[Hadith of warning|organized dinners]] in which he conveyed and advocated the substance of his message. At these events, Muhammad met fierce opposition from one of his uncles, [[Abu Lahab]].<ref name = R37/><ref name = P26>Peterson (2006), p. 26-7</ref> though his uncles [[Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib|Hamza]] and [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Abbas]] accepted him.\n\nMost Meccans ignored it and a few mocked him, while some others became his followers.<ref name=P36>''The Cambridge History of Islam'' (1977), p.36</ref> According to [[Ibn Sad]], in this period the Quraysh \"did not criticize what he said... When he passed by them as they sat in groups, they would point out to him and say \"There is the youth of the clan of Abd al-Muttalib who speaks (things) from heaven.\"<ref>Francis Edwards Peters,Prophet Muhammad and the Origins of Islam, SUNY Press, p.168</ref> According to [[Alford T. Welch|Welch]], the Qur'anic verses at this time were not \"based on a dogmatic conception of monotheism but on a strong general moral and religious appeal\". Its key themes include the [[moral responsibility]] of man towards his creator: the resurrection of the dead, God's final judgment followed by vivid descriptions of the tortures in hell and pleasures in paradise; the wonders of nature and everyday life, particularly the phenomenon of man, as signs of God to show the existence of a greater power who will take into account the greed of people and their suppression of the poor.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Welch, Muhammad, Encyclopedia of Islam</ref> Religious duties required of the believers at this time were few: belief in God, asking for forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, assisting others particularly those in need, rejecting cheating and the love of wealth (considered to be significant in the commercial life of Mecca), being chaste and not to kill new-born & under-aged girls.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nThere were three main groups of early converts to Islam: younger brothers and sons of great merchants, people who had fallen out of the first rank in their tribe or failed to attain it, and the weak, mostly unprotected foreigners.<ref name=P36/> The oligarchy of the Quraysh rejected the ideas that Muhammad preached, since they would have to surrender their privileges.{{better source|date=June 2017}} The Quraysh also did not accept Muhammad as a prophet since he came from a clan less powerful than his opponents'.<ref name = P26/>\n\nMuhammad, however, wanted to attract the influential to support his cause. In one attempt to win over the leaders of the Quraysh he was disrupted by a blind man. Muhammad, anxious that he may lose the opportunity to convey his message, turned away from the blind man. The Qur'an, however, rebuked Muhammad for turning away from the blind man.<ref name = P26/><ref>See {{cite quran|80|1|end=10|expand=no|style=nosup}}.</ref>\n\n==Opposition==\nConservative opposition arose to Muhammad's speeches. According to Ibn Sad, the opposition in Mecca started when Muhammad delivered verses that \"spoke shamefully of the idols they (the Meccans) worshiped other than Himself (God) and mentioned the perdition of their fathers who died in disbelief.\"<ref>Francis Edwards Peters,Muhammad and the Origins of Islam, SUNY Press, p.169</ref> According to Watt, as the ranks of Muhammad's followers swelled, he became a threat to the local tribes and the rulers of the city, whose wealth rested upon the Kaaba, the focal point of Meccan religious life, which Muhammad threatened to overthrow. Muhammad's denunciation of the Meccan traditional religion was especially offensive to his own tribe, the Quraysh, as they were the guardians of the Ka'aba.<ref name=P36/>\n\nSome of the ranking and influential leaders of the Quraysh tried and failed to come to some arrangements with Muhammad in exchange for abandoning his preaching. They offered him admission into the inner circle of merchants and establishing his position in the circle by an advantageous marriage, but Muhammad refused.<ref name=P36/> During this period, Muhammad urged his followers to be [[Pacifism|pacifist]], commanding them to \"deal gently with the infidels\".<ref name = P70>Peterson (2006), p. 70-1</ref>\n\n===Persecution===\n{{main|Persecution of Muslims by the Meccans}}\nThe relations between the Muslims and their pagan fellow-tribesmen rapidly deteriorated. Muhammad's denunciation of the Meccan idols provoked hostile reactions. Muhammad was mainly protected from physical harm due to belonging to the Banu Hashim. However, an attempt was made on his life by [[Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt]] who strangled Muhammad with a garment, until he was pushed away by [[Abu Bakr]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{Additional citation needed|date=October 2016}} In another attempt, [[Abu Jahl]], one of the tribal leaders, attempted a planned murder, as he tried to smash Muhammad in the head with a rock.<ref name=\"Sirat Ibn Hisham, vol. 1, p. 298\"/>\n\nA few Western scholars have said that there are records of persecution and ill-treatment of Muhammad's followers. Many of his followers were killed, tortured, harassed, assaulted and forced into exile.<ref>\n*Watt (1964) p. 76;\n*Peters (1999) p. 172\n*Michael Cook, ''Muhammad.'' In ''Founders of Faith,'' Oxford University Press, 1986, page 309.</ref> At first the more traditional Quraysh taunted Muslims, and interrupted their prayers.\n\nThe Quraysh was however reluctant to physically hurt Muhammad, since it would open up a blood feud between Muhammad and Abu Talib's clan, and the clan that hurt Muhammad. Brazenly initiating such a blood feud would also undercut the legitimacy and moral of authority of tribal chiefs in general.<ref name = P70/>\n\n===Migration to Axum===\n{{main|Migration to Abyssinia|Second migration to Abyssinia}}\n{{see also|Second and third deputation with Abu Talib}}\n[[File:LocationAksumiteEmpire.png|thumb|right|200px|Location of Abyssinia ([[Kingdom of Aksum]]).]]\nIn 615, at a time when his followers were suffering open violence, Muhammad arranged for his followers to emigrate to the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and found a small colony there under the protection of the Christian [[Al-Negashi|king]].<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/> While the traditions view the persecutions of Meccans to have played the major role in the emigration, [[William Montgomery Watt]], a professor of Islamic studies, states \"there is reason to believe that some sort of division within the embryonic Muslim community played a role and that some of the emigrants may have gone to Abyssinia to engage in trade, possibly in competition with prominent merchant families in Mecca.\"<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/>\n\n===Conversion of Umar===\n[[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] initially reacted to Muhammad's preaching by ardently opposing it. He seems to have been a devout pagan, angered by Muhammad's preaching which had led to divisions within Meccan society. He eventually decided to kill Muhammad, whom he held responsible for the divisions.<ref name = P72>Peterson (2006), p. 72-3</ref>\n\nA man told Umar, while Umar was en route to his planned assassination of Muhammad, that he should deal with his sister who had secretly converted to Islam. He then rushed to his sister's place, and heard her reciting the [[Qur'an]]. He considered the words beautiful and noble, and immediately converted to Islam. He made his conversion public instantly, even to the most hostile Quraysh. The effect of Umar's conversion was that Muslims could now pray openly at the [[Ka'ba]], as the pagans were reluctant to confront Umar, known for his forceful character.<ref name = P72/>\n\n===Three questions===\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\nAccording to Muslim tradition,{{which|date=June 2014}} the Quraysh sought to discredit Muhammad theologically after failing to stop him by other means. They sent a delegation to [[Yathrib]] to consult with the Jewish tribes. The [[Jews]], who had far greater experience with prophets, supplied three diagnostic questions to be asked from Muhammad:{{unreliablesource|date=June 2014}}<ref name = P75>Peterson (2006), p. 75-6</ref>\n*What is the story of the young men who left their people long ago?\n*Who was the traveler who had reached the ends of the then known world?\n*What is a description of the [[Holy Spirit]]?\n\nThey advised that if Muhammad was unable to answer those questions, he was a fraud. Islamic tradition states that Muhammad said he will answer the questions tomorrow, without saying \"Insha-Allah\" (Arabic for \"if God wills\"), which resulted in Muhammad not receiving a revelation with the answers for 15 days.<ref>Ibn Ishaq / A. Guillaume, \"The Life of Muhammad\", p. 136</ref> An admonition is also contained in the part of Qur'an (18:23\u201324) that was revealed along with the answers to the questions posed by Quraysh at the behest of the local Jews. Prophet Muhammad answered the questions (which are found in the Qur'an).<ref name = P75/> \n*These young men are the \"[[Seven Sleepers]] of [[Ephesus]]\" and further description was delivered as [[Sura]]h [[Kahf]].<ref>See {{cite quran|18|9|end=25|expand=no|style=nosup}} for the full description.</ref>{{primary source inline|date=June 2017}}\n*The traveler was \"[[Dhul-Qarnayn]]\", whose journeys are also delivered as Surah Kahf.<ref>See {{cite quran|18|93|end=99|expand=no|style=nosup}} for the full description.</ref>{{primary source inline|date=June 2017}}\n*This question can't be answered since the Holy Spirit exceeds human understanding.<ref>See {{cite quran|17|85|expand=no|style=nosup}}.</ref>{{primary source inline|date=June 2017}}\n\nAfter the answers the Quraysh did not convert to Islam.<ref name = P75/>\n\n===Boycott===\n{{main|Meccan boycott of the Hashemites}}\nAccording to tradition, two important clans of Quraysh, declared a public boycott against the clan of Banu Hashim, their commercial rival, in order to put pressure on the clan to withdraw its protection from Muhammad.<ref>Francis E. Peters, ''The Monotheists: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Conflict and Competition'', p.96</ref><ref name=\"Momen\"/> The terms imposed on Banu Hashim, as reported by Ibn Ishaq, were \"that no one should marry their women nor give women for them to marry; and that no one should either buy from them or sell to them, and when they agreed on that they wrote it in a deed.\"<ref>Francis E. Peters, ''Mecca: A Literary History of the Muslim Holy Land'',  Princeton University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-691-03267-X}}, p.54</ref> The boycott lasted for two or three years but eventually collapsed mainly because it was not achieving its purpose, and because the boycott had caused extreme privation and the sympathizers within the Quraysh finally united to annul the agreement.<ref name=\"Momen\">Moojan Momen, ''An Introduction to Shi'i Islam: The History and Doctrines of Twelver Shi\u02bbism'', Yale University Press, p.4</ref><ref>Daniel W.

Soon afterwards Abu Lahab withdrew the clan's protection from Muhammad. This placed Muhammad in mortal danger since the withdrawal of clan protection implied that the blood revenge for his killing would not be exacted. Muhammad then tried to find a protector for himself in another important city in Arabia, [[Ta'if]], but his effort failed and further brought him into physical danger. Muhammad was forced to return to Mecca. A Meccan man named Mut'im ibn Adi and the protection of the tribe of [[Banu Nawfal]] made it possible for him safely to re-enter his native city.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/><ref name=\"Momen\"/>\n\n===Isra and Mi'raj===\n{{Main|Isra and Mi'raj}}\nSome time in 620, Muhammad told his followers that he had experienced the ''[[Isra and Miraj]]'', a supernatural journey said to have been accomplished in one night along with the angel [[Gabriel]]. In the first part of the journey, the ''Isra'', he is said to have travelled from Mecca to \"the farthest mosque\" (in Arabic: ''masjid al-aqsa''), which Muslims usually identify with the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in [[Jerusalem]]. In the second part, the ''Miraj'', Muhammad is said to have toured [[heaven]] and [[hell]], and spoken with earlier prophets, such as [[Ibrahim]], [[Moses|Musa]], and [[Jesus|Isa]].\n[[File:Al aqsa moschee 2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] congregation building, the site from which Muhammad is believed by Muslims to have ascended to heaven.]] [[Ibn Ishaq]], author of first [[Sirah Rasul Allah|biography]] of Muhammad, presents this event as a spiritual experience while later historians like [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Al-Tabari]] and [[Ibn Kathir]] present it as a physical journey.<ref name=\"EoIMW\">''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World'' (2003), p. 482</ref> Some western scholars of Islam hold that the oldest Muslim tradition identified the journey as one traveled through the heavens from the sacred enclosure at Mecca to the celestial Ka\u02bfba (heavenly prototype of the Ka'ba); but later tradition identified Muhammad's journey from Mecca to the abode of sanctuary (bayt al-maqdis) in [[Jerusalem]].<ref>Sells, Michael. ''Ascension'', [[Encyclopaedia of the Quran]].</ref>\n\n===Pledges at Aqabah===\n{{main|Second pledge at al-Aqabah}}\nMany people were visiting Mecca on business or as pilgrims to the [[Kabaa]]. Muhammad took this opportunity to look for a new home for himself and his followers. After several unsuccessful negotiations, he found hope with some men from Yathrib (later called [[Medina]]).<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\">''Muhammad'', Encyclopedia of Islam.</ref> The Arab population of Yathrib were somewhat familiar with monotheism because a Jewish community existed in that city.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/>\n\nFollowing the pledges at Aqabah, Muhammad encouraged his followers to emigrate to [[Yathrib]]. As before, with the [[migration to Abyssinia]], the Quraysh attempted to stop the emigration. However, almost all Muslims managed to leave.<ref name = P87>Peterson (2006), pg. 86-9</ref>\n\n===Failed assassination===\n{{see also|Hijra (Islam)}}\n\nThe day of the scheduled assassination, Muhammad asked his friend [[Abu Bakr]], whom he had asked to stay behind, to make preparations for departure. He also asked his cousin [[Ali]] to stay behind to settle outstanding financial obligations. Muhammad slipped from his home the night of the planned assassination. Ali had worn Muhammad's cloak, leading the assassins to think Muhammad had not yet departed. By the time the assassins came to know of this, Muhammad had already departed.{{unreliablesource|date=June 2014}}<ref name = P87/>\n\nTo further trick his enemies, Muhammad travelled south for a few days instead of north to Yathrib (Medina). After a few days he took a relatively untrammeled path to the [[Red Sea]]. From there, he followed the coastline up to [[Yathrib]], arriving outside the town proper on Monday, 27 September 622.<ref name = P87/>\n\nAli survived the plot, but risked his life again by staying in Mecca to carry out Muhammed's instructions: to restore to their owners all the goods and properties that had been entrusted to Muhammad for safekeeping.

After the Quraysh-allied [[Banu Bakr]] tribe attacked and killed many of the Muslim-allied [[Banu Khuza'a]],  Muhammad gathered a large army to attack the Quraysh and take Mecca from them.

Thus the Arabian landscape was dotted with towns and cities near those oases, two prominent of which were Mecca and Medina (then known as Yathrib).<ref name=\"Muhammad-Mecca-12\">Watt (1953), pp.1\u20132</ref> Communal life was essential for survival in desert conditions, as people needed support against the harsh environment and lifestyle. The tribal grouping was thus encouraged by the need to act as a unit. This unity was based on the bond of kinship by blood.<ref>Watt (1953), pp. 16\u201318</ref> People of Arabia were either nomadic or sedentary, the former constantly traveling from one place to another seeking water and pasture for their flocks, while the latter settled and focused on trade and agriculture. The survival of nomads (or [[bedouins]]) was also partially dependent on raiding caravans or oases; thus they saw this as no crime.<ref name=\"Rue\">Loyal Rue, ''Religion Is Not about God: How Spiritual Traditions Nurture Our Biological'',2005, p.224</ref><ref name=\"Esposito4\">John Esposito, ''Islam'', Expanded edition, Oxford University Press, p.4-5</ref> Medina was a large flourishing agricultural settlement, while Mecca was an important financial center for many of the surrounding tribes.<ref name=\"Muhammad-Mecca-12\"/>\n\nIn pre-Islamic Arabia gods or goddesses were viewed as protectors of individual tribes and their spirits were associated with sacred trees, stones, springs and wells. There was an important shrine in Mecca (called the [[Kaaba]]) that housed statues of 360 idols of tribal patron deities and was the site of an annual pilgrimage. Aside from these tribal gods, Arabs shared a common belief in a supreme deity Allah (akin to \"God\" in English, as opposed to \"god\") who was however remote from their everyday concerns and thus not the object of cult or ritual. Three goddesses were associated with Allah as his daughters: [[Al-l\u0101t|al-Lat]], [[Man\u0101t|Manat]] and [[al-Uzza]]. Some monotheistic communities also existed in Arabia, including Christians and Jews.<ref>See:\n*Esposito, ''Islam'', Extended Edition, Oxford University Press, pp.5\u20137\n*Qur'an 3:95</ref><ref>[[Hanif]]s \u2013 native pre-Islamic Arab monotheists \u2013 are also sometimes listed alongside Jews and Christians in pre-Islamic Arabia, although their historicity is disputed amongst scholars cf.

Other variants of the story say that it was a miraculous movement of a cloud or an unusual behavior of a branch that kept shadowing Muhammad regardless of the time of the day. The monk revealed his visions of Muhammad's future to the boy's companion, warning him to preserve the child from the [[Jew]]s (in Ibn Sa'd's version) or from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] (in al-Tabari's version).<ref name=\"Bahira\">Abel, A. \"Ba\u1e25\u012br\u0101\".

He was obliged to help support other members of his family and so after accompanying his uncle on trading journeys to [[Syria]], he became a merchant and was involved in trade between the Indian Ocean and the [[Mediterranean Sea]].<ref name=\"Watt8\"/><ref>Ramadan (2007), p. 19</ref><ref name=\"BerkWorldHistory\">''Berkshire Encyclopedia of World History'' (2005), v.3, p.1025</ref> He became known as \"Al-Amin\" (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0646), meaning \"Trustworthy\" and was sought out as an impartial arbitrator of disputes.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/><ref name=\"EncWorldHistory\">''Encyclopedia of World History'' (1998), p.452</ref><ref>Esposito(1998), p.6</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\n{{see also|Genealogy of Khadijah's daughters}}\n[[Khadijah bint Khuwaylid]], a widow merchant at Mecca, heard about Muhammad, and asked him to manage her commercial operations in Syria. When Muhammad returned from an extraordinarily successful commercial trip, Khadija proposed to him through her friend Nafisa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/glance-life-holy-prophet-islam-dar-rah-haqq/chapter-4-prophet%E2%80%99s-first-marriage|title=Chapter 4: The Prophet\u2019s first Marriage|website=Al-Islam.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}</ref><ref name=\"BerkWorldHistory\"/> Tradition reports that Khadija was forty years old.\n\nMuhammad consented to the marriage, which by all accounts was a happy one. Khadija was not only Muhammad's wife, but also his friend and confidante and later his moral support. After his wedding, Khadija gave Muhammad the slave boy [[Zayd ibn Harithah]].<ref>Peterson (2006), p. 45</ref> [[Ibn Ishaq]] records that Khadijah bore Muhammad six children: a boy named [[Qasim ibn Muhammad|Qasim]], who lived only two years, then four girls [[Zainab bint Muhammad|Zaynab]], [[Ruqayyah bint Muhammad|Ruqayyah]], [[Umm Kulthum bint Muhammad|Um Kulthum]], [[Fatima Zahra|Fatimah]] and finally a boy named Abdullah, who also died at two.<ref name =R22>Ramadan (2007), p. 22-4</ref> The combination of the death of Abdullah, and his desire to relieve his uncle Abu Talib of the burden of a large family, as Abu Talib was already in great financial difficulty, led Muhammad to take his uncle's son [[Ali]] into his own home. Muhammad also adopted Zayd, giving him the name \"Zayd ibn Muhammad\" (meaning Zayd son of Muhammad). However, owing to the adoption revelation from Allah, later verses were revealed stating clearly that a child, especially after adoption, could not be treated as a natural son by marriage or inheritance. Consequently, the adopted child had to retain the name of his or her biological father. Therefore, Zayd could not be known as the son of Muhammad, but the son of his father, Haritha, and be known as Zayd ibn Haritha. In Quran 33:40 it says: ''40. Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of All\u00e2h and the last of the Prophets. And All\u00e2h is Ever All-Aware of everything. ''<ref name = R22/>\n\n===Restoration of Kaaba===\nAccording to tradition, Muhammad played a role in the restoration of the [[Kaaba]], after parts of it had been destroyed by one of Mecca's frequent [[flash flood]]s.<ref>F.E.Peters(2003), p. 54</ref> When the reconstruction was almost done, disagreements arose among the clan leaders as to who would have the honor of lifting the sacred [[Black Stone]] into place. The disagreements increased to the point where the clans were about to take up arm against each other, when one of the elders suggested they take the advice of the next person who entered the gates of the [[Haram]]. This happened to be Muhammad. He spread out his cloak, put the stone in the middle and had members of the four major clans raise it to its destined position. Then he took it in his own hands and fitted it in its place. The cloak became an important symbol for later poets and writers<ref>Jonathan M. Bloom, Sheila S. Blair (2002), p. 28-29</ref> because of this event and what happened later as described in the [[Ahl al-Kisa|Hadith of the Cloak]].\n\n==The Beginnings of the Qur'an==\n{{Quran}}\n{{main|Muhammad's first revelation}}\n{{see also|Wahy}}\nAt some point Muhammad adopted the practice of meditating alone for several weeks every year in a cave on [[Cave of Hira|Mount Hira]] near Mecca.<ref>Emory C. Bogle(1998), p.6</ref><ref>John Henry Haaren, Addison B. Poland(1904), p.83</ref> Islamic tradition holds that in one of his visits to Mount Hira, the angel [[Gabriel]] began communicating with him in the year 610 and commanded Muhammad to recite the following verses of Surah Alaq, the 96th Surah of the Quran:<ref>Brown (2003), pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n<blockquote>Proclaim! (or read!) in the name of thy Lord and Cherisher, Who created- Created man, out of a (mere) clot of congealed blood: Proclaim! And thy Lord is Most Bountiful,- He Who taught (the use of) the pen,- Taught man that which he knew not.(Qur'an {{cite quran|96|1\u20135|style=nosup|expand=no}})</blockquote>\n\nAccording to some traditions, upon receiving his first revelations Muhammad was deeply distressed, but the spirit moved closer and told him that he had been chosen as a messenger of God. Muhammad returned home and was consoled and reassured by his wife Khadijah and her Christian cousin, [[Waraqah ibn Nawfal]]. Shia tradition, on the other hand, maintains that Muhammad was neither surprised nor frightened at the appearance of Gabriel but rather welcomed him as if he had been expecting him.<ref>\n*Emory C. Bogle (1998), p.7\n*Razwy (1996), ch. 9\n*Rodinson (2002), p. 71.</ref> The initial revelation was followed by a pause of three years during which Muhammad gave himself up further to prayers and [[spiritual practice]]s. When the revelations resumed he was reassured and commanded to begin preaching: Your lord has not forsaken you nor does he hate [you] (Qur'an {{cite quran|93|1\u201311|style=nosup|expand=no}}).<ref>Brown (2003), pp. 73\u201374</ref><ref>Uri Rubin, ''Muhammad'', [[Encyclopedia of the Quran]]</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Alford T. Welch|Welch]] these revelations were accompanied by mysterious seizures, and the reports are unlikely to have been forged by later Muslims.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/> Muhammad was confident that he could distinguish his own thoughts from these messages.<ref>Watt, ''The Cambridge History of Islam'' (1977), p. 31.</ref>\n\n===Mission===\n\nMuhammad's mission involves preaching [[monotheism]]. The Qur'an demands Muhammad to proclaim and praise the name of [[Allah|his Lord]] and instructs him not to worship idols or associate other deities with God but to only worship the [[Islamic concept of God| one God]].<ref name=\"EoQ-Muhammad\"/> According to the Qur'an, one of the main roles of Muhammad is to warn the unbelievers of their eschatological punishment (Qur'an {{cite quran|38|70|style=nosup|expand=no}}, Qur'an {{cite quran|6|19|style=nosup|expand=no}}). Sometimes the Qur'an does not explicitly refer to the Judgement Day but also provides examples from the history of some extinct communities and warns Muhammad's contemporaries of similar calamities (Qur'an {{cite quran|41|13|end=16|style=nosup|expand=no}}).<ref name=\"EoQ-Muhammad\">Uri Rubin, ''Muhammad'', [[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]]</ref>\n\n====Early preaching====\nMuhammad first told about his message to his wife, his cousin Ali, his adopted son Zayd, his nursemaid [[Um Ayman]] and his friend [[Abu Bakr]], all of whom accepted it. Abu Bakr, who used to purchase slaves to set them free in accordance with Muhammad's principle of equality, attracted a large number of converts. Nevertheless, the converts remained small, and Muhammad concentrated on quietly building a small, but spiritually strong, community.<ref name = R37>Ramadan (2007), p. 37-9</ref>\n\nAround 613, the Qur'an then commanded Muhammad to \"admonish your nearest kinsmen\" ({{cite quran|26|214|style=ref}}), initiating the phase of public preaching. One day he climbed [[Mount as-Safa]], and called out the tribal chiefs. After receiving assurances that the chiefs, who reportedly never heard Muhammad tell lies, would believe him, he declared the [[Tawhid|Oneness of God]]. Later Muhammad [[Hadith of warning|organized dinners]] in which he conveyed and advocated the substance of his message. At these events, Muhammad met fierce opposition from one of his uncles, [[Abu Lahab]].<ref name = R37/><ref name = P26>Peterson (2006), p. 26-7</ref> though his uncles [[Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib|Hamza]] and [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Abbas]] accepted him.\n\nMost Meccans ignored it and a few mocked him, while some others became his followers.<ref name=P36>''The Cambridge History of Islam'' (1977), p.36</ref> According to [[Ibn Sad]], in this period the Quraysh \"did not criticize what he said... When he passed by them as they sat in groups, they would point out to him and say \"There is the youth of the clan of Abd al-Muttalib who speaks (things) from heaven.\"<ref>Francis Edwards Peters,Prophet Muhammad and the Origins of Islam, SUNY Press, p.168</ref> According to [[Alford T. Welch|Welch]], the Qur'anic verses at this time were not \"based on a dogmatic conception of monotheism but on a strong general moral and religious appeal\". Its key themes include the [[moral responsibility]] of man towards his creator: the resurrection of the dead, God's final judgment followed by vivid descriptions of the tortures in hell and pleasures in paradise; the wonders of nature and everyday life, particularly the phenomenon of man, as signs of God to show the existence of a greater power who will take into account the greed of people and their suppression of the poor.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Welch, Muhammad, Encyclopedia of Islam</ref> Religious duties required of the believers at this time were few: belief in God, asking for forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, assisting others particularly those in need, rejecting cheating and the love of wealth (considered to be significant in the commercial life of Mecca), being chaste and not to kill new-born & under-aged girls.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nThere were three main groups of early converts to Islam: younger brothers and sons of great merchants, people who had fallen out of the first rank in their tribe or failed to attain it, and the weak, mostly unprotected foreigners.<ref name=P36/> The oligarchy of the Quraysh rejected the ideas that Muhammad preached, since they would have to surrender their privileges.{{better source|date=June 2017}} The Quraysh also did not accept Muhammad as a prophet since he came from a clan less powerful than his opponents'.<ref name = P26/>\n\nMuhammad, however, wanted to attract the influential to support his cause. In one attempt to win over the leaders of the Quraysh he was disrupted by a blind man. Muhammad, anxious that he may lose the opportunity to convey his message, turned away from the blind man. The Qur'an, however, rebuked Muhammad for turning away from the blind man.<ref name = P26/><ref>See {{cite quran|80|1|end=10|expand=no|style=nosup}}.</ref>\n\n==Opposition==\nConservative opposition arose to Muhammad's speeches. According to Ibn Sad, the opposition in Mecca started when Muhammad delivered verses that \"spoke shamefully of the idols they (the Meccans) worshiped other than Himself (God) and mentioned the perdition of their fathers who died in disbelief.\"<ref>Francis Edwards Peters,Muhammad and the Origins of Islam, SUNY Press, p.169</ref> According to Watt, as the ranks of Muhammad's followers swelled, he became a threat to the local tribes and the rulers of the city, whose wealth rested upon the Kaaba, the focal point of Meccan religious life, which Muhammad threatened to overthrow. Muhammad's denunciation of the Meccan traditional religion was especially offensive to his own tribe, the Quraysh, as they were the guardians of the Ka'aba.<ref name=P36/>\n\nSome of the ranking and influential leaders of the Quraysh tried and failed to come to some arrangements with Muhammad in exchange for abandoning his preaching. They offered him admission into the inner circle of merchants and establishing his position in the circle by an advantageous marriage, but Muhammad refused.<ref name=P36/> During this period, Muhammad urged his followers to be [[Pacifism|pacifist]], commanding them to \"deal gently with the infidels\".<ref name = P70>Peterson (2006), p. 70-1</ref>\n\n===Persecution===\n{{main|Persecution of Muslims by the Meccans}}\nThe relations between the Muslims and their pagan fellow-tribesmen rapidly deteriorated. Muhammad's denunciation of the Meccan idols provoked hostile reactions. Muhammad was mainly protected from physical harm due to belonging to the Banu Hashim. However, an attempt was made on his life by [[Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt]] who strangled Muhammad with a garment, until he was pushed away by [[Abu Bakr]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{Additional citation needed|date=October 2016}} In another attempt, [[Abu Jahl]], one of the tribal leaders, attempted a planned murder, as he tried to smash Muhammad in the head with a rock.<ref name=\"Sirat Ibn Hisham, vol. 1, p. 298\"/>\n\nA few Western scholars have said that there are records of persecution and ill-treatment of Muhammad's followers. Many of his followers were killed, tortured, harassed, assaulted and forced into exile.<ref>\n*Watt (1964) p. 76;\n*Peters (1999) p. 172\n*Michael Cook, ''Muhammad.'' In ''Founders of Faith,'' Oxford University Press, 1986, page 309.</ref> At first the more traditional Quraysh taunted Muslims, and interrupted their prayers.\n\nThe Quraysh was however reluctant to physically hurt Muhammad, since it would open up a blood feud between Muhammad and Abu Talib's clan, and the clan that hurt Muhammad. Brazenly initiating such a blood feud would also undercut the legitimacy and moral of authority of tribal chiefs in general.<ref name = P70/>\n\n===Migration to Axum===\n{{main|Migration to Abyssinia|Second migration to Abyssinia}}\n{{see also|Second and third deputation with Abu Talib}}\n[[File:LocationAksumiteEmpire.png|thumb|right|200px|Location of Abyssinia ([[Kingdom of Aksum]]).]]\nIn 615, at a time when his followers were suffering open violence, Muhammad arranged for his followers to emigrate to the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and found a small colony there under the protection of the Christian [[Al-Negashi|king]].<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/> While the traditions view the persecutions of Meccans to have played the major role in the emigration, [[William Montgomery Watt]], a professor of Islamic studies, states \"there is reason to believe that some sort of division within the embryonic Muslim community played a role and that some of the emigrants may have gone to Abyssinia to engage in trade, possibly in competition with prominent merchant families in Mecca.\"<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/>\n\n===Conversion of Umar===\n[[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] initially reacted to Muhammad's preaching by ardently opposing it. He seems to have been a devout pagan, angered by Muhammad's preaching which had led to divisions within Meccan society. He eventually decided to kill Muhammad, whom he held responsible for the divisions.<ref name = P72>Peterson (2006), p. 72-3</ref>\n\nA man told Umar, while Umar was en route to his planned assassination of Muhammad, that he should deal with his sister who had secretly converted to Islam. He then rushed to his sister's place, and heard her reciting the [[Qur'an]]. He considered the words beautiful and noble, and immediately converted to Islam. He made his conversion public instantly, even to the most hostile Quraysh. The effect of Umar's conversion was that Muslims could now pray openly at the [[Ka'ba]], as the pagans were reluctant to confront Umar, known for his forceful character.<ref name = P72/>\n\n===Three questions===\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\nAccording to Muslim tradition,{{which|date=June 2014}} the Quraysh sought to discredit Muhammad theologically after failing to stop him by other means. They sent a delegation to [[Yathrib]] to consult with the Jewish tribes. The [[Jews]], who had far greater experience with prophets, supplied three diagnostic questions to be asked from Muhammad:{{unreliablesource|date=June 2014}}<ref name = P75>Peterson (2006), p. 75-6</ref>\n*What is the story of the young men who left their people long ago?\n*Who was the traveler who had reached the ends of the then known world?\n*What is a description of the [[Holy Spirit]]?\n\nThey advised that if Muhammad was unable to answer those questions, he was a fraud. Islamic tradition states that Muhammad said he will answer the questions tomorrow, without saying \"Insha-Allah\" (Arabic for \"if God wills\"), which resulted in Muhammad not receiving a revelation with the answers for 15 days.<ref>Ibn Ishaq / A. Guillaume, \"The Life of Muhammad\", p. 136</ref> An admonition is also contained in the part of Qur'an (18:23\u201324) that was revealed along with the answers to the questions posed by Quraysh at the behest of the local Jews. Prophet Muhammad answered the questions (which are found in the Qur'an).<ref name = P75/> \n*These young men are the \"[[Seven Sleepers]] of [[Ephesus]]\" and further description was delivered as [[Sura]]h [[Kahf]].<ref>See {{cite quran|18|9|end=25|expand=no|style=nosup}} for the full description.</ref>{{primary source inline|date=June 2017}}\n*The traveler was \"[[Dhul-Qarnayn]]\", whose journeys are also delivered as Surah Kahf.<ref>See {{cite quran|18|93|end=99|expand=no|style=nosup}} for the full description.</ref>{{primary source inline|date=June 2017}}\n*This question can't be answered since the Holy Spirit exceeds human understanding.<ref>See {{cite quran|17|85|expand=no|style=nosup}}.</ref>{{primary source inline|date=June 2017}}\n\nAfter the answers the Quraysh did not convert to Islam.<ref name = P75/>\n\n===Boycott===\n{{main|Meccan boycott of the Hashemites}}\nAccording to tradition, two important clans of Quraysh, declared a public boycott against the clan of Banu Hashim, their commercial rival, in order to put pressure on the clan to withdraw its protection from Muhammad.<ref>Francis E. Peters, ''The Monotheists: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Conflict and Competition'', p.96</ref><ref name=\"Momen\"/> The terms imposed on Banu Hashim, as reported by Ibn Ishaq, were \"that no one should marry their women nor give women for them to marry; and that no one should either buy from them or sell to them, and when they agreed on that they wrote it in a deed.\"<ref>Francis E. Peters, ''Mecca: A Literary History of the Muslim Holy Land'',  Princeton University Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-691-03267-X}}, p.54</ref> The boycott lasted for two or three years but eventually collapsed mainly because it was not achieving its purpose, and because the boycott had caused extreme privation and the sympathizers within the Quraysh finally united to annul the agreement.<ref name=\"Momen\">Moojan Momen, ''An Introduction to Shi'i Islam: The History and Doctrines of Twelver Shi\u02bbism'', Yale University Press, p.4</ref><ref>Daniel W.

Soon afterwards Abu Lahab withdrew the clan's protection from Muhammad. This placed Muhammad in mortal danger since the withdrawal of clan protection implied that the blood revenge for his killing would not be exacted. Muhammad then tried to find a protector for himself in another important city in Arabia, [[Ta'if]], but his effort failed and further brought him into physical danger. Muhammad was forced to return to Mecca. A Meccan man named Mut'im ibn Adi and the protection of the tribe of [[Banu Nawfal]] made it possible for him safely to re-enter his native city.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/><ref name=\"Momen\"/>\n\n===Isra and Mi'raj===\n{{Main|Isra and Mi'raj}}\nSome time in 620, Muhammad told his followers that he had experienced the ''[[Isra and Miraj]]'', a supernatural journey said to have been accomplished in one night along with the angel [[Gabriel]]. In the first part of the journey, the ''Isra'', he is said to have travelled from Mecca to \"the farthest mosque\" (in Arabic: ''masjid al-aqsa''), which Muslims usually identify with the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in [[Jerusalem]]. In the second part, the ''Miraj'', Muhammad is said to have toured [[heaven]] and [[hell]], and spoken with earlier prophets, such as [[Ibrahim]], [[Moses|Musa]], and [[Jesus|Isa]].\n[[File:Al aqsa moschee 2.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] congregation building, the site from which Muhammad is believed by Muslims to have ascended to heaven.]] [[Ibn Ishaq]], author of first [[Sirah Rasul Allah|biography]] of Muhammad, presents this event as a spiritual experience while later historians like [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Al-Tabari]] and [[Ibn Kathir]] present it as a physical journey.<ref name=\"EoIMW\">''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World'' (2003), p. 482</ref> Some western scholars of Islam hold that the oldest Muslim tradition identified the journey as one traveled through the heavens from the sacred enclosure at Mecca to the celestial Ka\u02bfba (heavenly prototype of the Ka'ba); but later tradition identified Muhammad's journey from Mecca to the abode of sanctuary (bayt al-maqdis) in [[Jerusalem]].<ref>Sells, Michael. ''Ascension'', [[Encyclopaedia of the Quran]].</ref>\n\n===Pledges at Aqabah===\n{{main|Second pledge at al-Aqabah}}\nMany people were visiting Mecca on business or as pilgrims to the [[Kabaa]]. Muhammad took this opportunity to look for a new home for himself and his followers. After several unsuccessful negotiations, he found hope with some men from Yathrib (later called [[Medina]]).<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\">''Muhammad'', Encyclopedia of Islam.</ref> The Arab population of Yathrib were somewhat familiar with monotheism because a Jewish community existed in that city.<ref name=\"EoI-Muhammad\"/>\n\nFollowing the pledges at Aqabah, Muhammad encouraged his followers to emigrate to [[Yathrib]]. As before, with the [[migration to Abyssinia]], the Quraysh attempted to stop the emigration. However, almost all Muslims managed to leave.<ref name = P87>Peterson (2006), pg. 86-9</ref>\n\n===Failed assassination===\n{{see also|Hijra (Islam)}}\n\nThe day of the scheduled assassination, Muhammad asked his friend [[Abu Bakr]], whom he had asked to stay behind, to make preparations for departure. He also asked his cousin [[Ali]] to stay behind to settle outstanding financial obligations. Muhammad slipped from his home the night of the planned assassination. Ali had worn Muhammad's cloak, leading the assassins to think Muhammad had not yet departed. By the time the assassins came to know of this, Muhammad had already departed.{{unreliablesource|date=June 2014}}<ref name = P87/>\n\nTo further trick his enemies, Muhammad travelled south for a few days instead of north to Yathrib (Medina). After a few days he took a relatively untrammeled path to the [[Red Sea]]. From there, he followed the coastline up to [[Yathrib]], arriving outside the town proper on Monday, 27 September 622.<ref name = P87/>\n\nAli survived the plot, but risked his life again by staying in Mecca to carry out Muhammed's instructions: to restore to their owners all the goods and properties that had been entrusted to Muhammad for safekeeping.

The series focuses on the conflict between humanity, the subterranean reptilian hominids known as the Locust Horde, and their mutated counterparts, the Lambent. The franchise consists of six third-person shooter video games, which has also been supplemented by a comic book series and five novels.\n\nThe first installment, titled ''[[Gears of War (video game)|Gears of War]]'', was released on November 7, 2006 for the [[Xbox 360]]. The game follows protagonist [[Marcus Fenix]], a soldier in the Coalition of Ordered Governments tasked to lead a last-ditch effort to destroy the Locust Horde and save humanity. Two subsequent titles, ''[[Gears of War 2]]'' (2008) and ''[[Gears of War 3]]'' (2011), continued Fenix and humanity's ongoing conflict with the Locust Horde and Lambent forces. In 2013, Epic Games and Microsoft released ''[[Gears of War: Judgment]]'', a prequel to the series\u2019 first title, which instead focuses on Damon Baird, one of Fenix's squad-mates.<ref>{{cite news | first = Mitch | last = Dyer | title = Trial By Fire | date = 2013-03-17 | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/18/gears-of-war-judgment-review | work = [[IGN]] | accessdate = 2014-02-02}}</ref> ''Gears of War: Ultimate Edition'' was released for Microsoft Windows on March 1, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2015/06/gears-war-ultimate-edition-killer-instinct-coming-windows-10 |title=Gears of War: Ultimate Edition and Killer Instinct coming to Windows 10 |publisher=Gematsu |date=2014-07-31 |accessdate=2015-06-25}}</ref> The series' third sequel, ''[[Gears of War 4]]'', is set 25 years after ''Gears of War 3'' and follows Marcus Fenix's son, JD, as he battles a new resurrected Locust Horde that once again threatens humanity.<ref name=GOW4>{{cite web|url=http://www.dualshockers.com/2016/03/08/gears-of-war-4-gets-tons-of-new-details-on-game-informer/|title=Gears of War 4 Gets Tons of New Details on Game Informer|accessdate=April 8, 2016|website=DualShockers}}</ref> ''[[Gears 5]]'' (2019) revolves around Kait, a friend of JD, who embarks on a quest to learn her true origin and relation to the Locust Horde.\n\n''Gears of War'' was developed by Epic Games.

Human civilization develops on Sera and endures a millennia-long conflict that leaves humanity on the brink of extinction. Sera's leaders broker an era of peace that ushers an era of scientific advancements and a cultural renaissance. Humanity's population sporadically grows and demands more energy provided by [[fossil fuel|fossil]] and [[nuclear power|nuclear fuels]]. Sera's scientists discover Imulsion, a naturally occurring substance that can be refined into a potent energy source. Imulsion solves Sera's energy crisis but ultimately creates great economic disparity. Nations with direct access to Imulsion prosper, while other nations fall into financial turmoil.\n  \nSera's citizens [[balkanize]] into two warring factions: the Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG) and Union of Independent Republics (UIR). The ensuing 79-year strife, known as the Pendulum Wars, consumes millions of lives with both sides locked in a virtual stalemate. The UIR develops the 'Hammer of Dawn', a system of satellites capable of delivering precise and potent orbital-to-surface laser strikes. However, a contingent of COG commandos, led by [[Marcus Fenix]], Dominic Santiago, and Victor Hoffman launch a daring raid on a UIR stronghold and steal the schematics for the Hammer of Dawn. The UIR quickly surrenders after witnessing the Hammer of Dawn devastate one of their naval vessels after being completed by Marcus Fenix's father, scientist Adam Fenix.\n \nSix weeks after the COG and UIR agreed to an armistice, a race of creatures known as the Locust Horde unexpectedly emerge from Sera's depths and begin assaulting all human cities, wiping out 25% of the world population in the first 26 hours. The Locust Horde easily overwhelms the already battleworn COG forces during this surprise attack, referred to as 'Emergence Day'. The COG retreats to cities located on the Jacinto Plateau, their last bastion where the Locust cannot dig through, and reluctantly bombard their own cities with the Hammer of Dawn to halt the Locust Horde's offensive. The ensuing [[scorched earth]] tactic destroys much of Sera's cities and human population. The COG continues to operate out of the capital city of Ephyra and cities on the plateau such as Jacinto, while the surviving humans, known as Stranded, are left to wander through Sera's charred ruins. \n\nFive years after Emergence Day, the Locust reemerge and begin a campaign of occupying human cities located on the Jacinto Plateau to act as stepping stones in order to destroy Ephyra. Eventually, the Locust are able to emerge and overrun the COG capital of Ephyra ten years after Emergence Day. During the chaos, Marcus Fenix leads an unauthorized mission to save his father, Adam, from the Locust assault. However, a King Raven helicopter is shot down by the Locust Horde and crash-lands into the Fenix Estate, presumably killing Adam Fenix. The COG's leadership [[court martial]]s Marcus and sentences him to life imprisonment. After losing Ephyra, the remainder of the COG retreats to Jacinto City, which resides on the edge of the plateau against an ocean. \n\n''[[Gears of War (video game)|Gears of War]]'' is set fourteen years after the Locust emerged and attacked Sera's human population. The COG forces devise a last-ditch offensive to destroy the Locust Horde with the Lightmass Bomb, weaponized forms of Imulsion. Marcus Fenix, now a disgraced veteran, is reinstated into the COG army four years after imprisonment to supplement the COG's depleted ranks. Marcus joins his best friend, Dominic Santiago, on a mission to map the Locust Horde's tunnel network in preparation for the bombing. However, their unit is ambushed by Locust Ground forces and sustain heavy casualties. Fenix and Santiago regroup with two other survivors, Augustus Cole and Damon Baird, and continue their mission. Marcus ultimately prevails in not only mapping, but successfully deploying the Lightmass Bomb and crippling the Locust Horde. However, the Locust Queen, Myrrah, pledges to continue the war effort. \n\nIn the weeks following the Lightmass Bombing, the human population begins suffering from a condition known as Rustlung, a fatal disease caused by the inhalation of Imulsion fumes - due to the evaporation of Imulsion caused by the Lightmass Bomb. The Locust reemerge and brought with them a force allowing them to sink the cities on the Jacinto Plateau. Following the sinking of nearby cities Tollen and Montevado, and the desperate raid attacks on Jacinto City, the COG fears that the Locust might be trying to sink Jacinto as well. \n\nIn ''[[Gears of War 2]]'', the COG Forces in-turn deploy thousands of soldiers directly into the depths of Sera to directly battle the Locust Horde and stop their plans to sink Jacinto. The COG discovers after the sinking of Ilima City that the Locust have been using a gargantuan worm to sink the cities on the Jacinto Plateau. After killing the Riftworm, Delta Squad is then ordered to locate the Locust stronghold by accessing intel from a decommissioned COG laboratory called New Hope, which is full of genetically altered humans called Sires, which Marcus believes were experiments that led to the creation of the Locust Horde. Locating the Locust stronghold, Nexus, under Mount Kadar - the COG discovers during the battle that members of the Locust Horde are mutating from exposure from Imulsion into \u2018Lambent\u2019. These abominations have been forcing the Locust to abandon their underground civilization to try to claim the surface world as their new home. Marcus devises a plan to intentionally sink Jacinto and using the surrounding sea water to flood the Locust and Lambent tunnel network. The COG evacuate Jacinto just as the city collapses and drowns a majority of the Locust Horde.\n\nThe remaining population of the COG rediscover an island base never attacked by the Locust Horde called Vectes, with a town known as Pelruan. The Stranded gangs on the island threaten the safety of the town, but the COG and Stranded cease when the Lambent begin to overrun the island and surrounding ocean. Due to the underground being flooded, the Imulsion from the Hollow was raised into the surface of Sera, causing a pandemic and turning all life into Lambent organisms. The leader of the COG, Chairman Richard Prescott, is believed to be holding secrets from the population. Prescott then abandons the COG, forcing them to disband and live as nomads, surviving against the Lambent and Locust stragglers. \n\n''[[Gears of War 3]]'' is set seventeen years after Emergence Day. Set two years after the COG disbanded, Prescott returns to reveal that he kidnapped Marcus Fenix's father during the fall of Ephyra and transported him to a secret island facility known as Azura, and that Adam has created a device known as the Imulsion countermeasure that could neutralize both the Lambent and Locust. However, the island was attacked and is now occupied by Queen Myrrah and the remaining Locust forces. Marcus and his allies reach Azura after Dominic sacrifices himself to rescue his friends from imminent demise.  Adam is rescued and releases his anti-Imulsion weapon but reveals he infected himself with the Lambent contagion to develop the weapon. The Imulsion countermeasure vaporizes all Lambent, including Adam, and the crystallizes the Locust.  Marcus personally kills Myrrah and dedicates her demise to his fallen friends, family, and comrades.  \n\n''[[Gears of War: Judgment]]'', focuses on Baird and Cole during the early months after Emergence Day. With military cadet Sofia Hendrick and Garron Paduk, a former UIR soldier, they comprise the Kilo Squad. Baird disobeys orders to use a Lightmass Missile to destroy Locust forces and save survivors at Halvo Bay. Despite also killing the powerful Locust leader Karn, the squad is court-martialed because they disobeyed orders. But because they saved Col. Ezra Loomis and killed Karn, they avoid execution or imprisonment, with Baird demoted from lieutenant to private. A separate campaign, \"Aftermath\", portrays Baird, Cole, and Paduk in the hours before the activation of the anti-Imulsion energy wave.\n\nFollowing the end of the Locust War and Lambent Pandemic, the humans of Sera began to rebuild and started with reorganizing the Coalition of Ordered Governments. Led by First Minister Anya Stroud, wife of Marcus Fenix, the humans begin to rebuild civilization with the assistance of robotic engineers created by Damon Baird. The COG was successful in creating New Ephyra and other walled cities known as Settlements outside of New Ephyra. Following fertility treatment, Anya was able to bear Marcus Fenix's son, James Dominic \"JD\" Fenix. However, Anya later died from birthing complications and the COG began a more authoritarian rule - prompting many civilians to abandon the COG and live off the land, known as Outsiders. JD was then sent to boarding school and met best friend Delmont \"Del\" Walker. After joining the military, both JD and Del were forced to execute civilians during a protest in Settlement 2, prompting them to leave the COG and becoming Outsiders. They joined a village led by Reyna Diaz and her brother-in-law, Oscar. Reyna's daughter, Kait, became close with JD and Del.  \n\n''[[Gears of War 4]]'' takes place 25 years after the original ''Gears of War'' trilogy. JD, accompanied by Kait and Del, conduct frequent raids on COG fortifications to acquire various supplies. The three successfully fend off a COG counterattack only to have their encampment devastated by a new foe, called the Swarm. Kait's mother, Reyna, is captured during the chaos. JD, Kait, and Del reach out to Marcus, now a disgruntled COG expatriate, who reluctantly agrees to help them. The COG, led by First Minister Mina Jinn, pursue the group after erroneously believing they are behind a string of mass-kidnappings.  The four reach a Locust mass-burial site, where they uncover evidence suggesting that Adam Fenix's countermeasure caused the Locust Horde to enter a cocooned metamorphosis state. Their fears are confirmed when various Locust Horde soldiers attack them in conjunction with the Swarm. The group receives assistance from Damon Baird along with Augustus Cole and Samantha Byrne. They battle their way to the Swarm's hive and defeat multiple Swarm and Locust monstrosities.  However, they reach the hive to learn that Swarm's hive-mind has forcefully integrated with Reyna. Kait frees her mother, knowing she will die but will no longer suffer. Reyna gives Kait a parting gift that belonged to her mother \u2013 a necklace bearing the insignia of the Locust Queen, Myrrah.\n\nKait, JD, Del, and Marcus rejoin the COG and offer their intelligence to Jinn in order to help fight the Swarm. However, Kait begins to have nightmares and visions related to her mother, the Swarm, and the Locust - but refuses to tell the others about it. Marcus and Baird believe they will need the Hammer of Dawn back online to help defend against the upcoming war with the Swarm. Baird then uncovers additional Hammer of Dawn satellites at Azura. \n\nIn ''[[Gears 5]]'', JD, Kait, Del, and Marcus travel to Azura to launch the Hammer of Dawn satellites. Afterwards, they assist in the evacuation of Settlement 2 as the Swarm have begun their attack on COG Settlements. Four months later, Kait is captured by the Swarm and connects her to the Swarm hivemind, allowing her to control the Swarm to kill the humans, including her uncle. She's freed by Marcus and JD, but in her grief reveals that she's been having visions and nightmare and believes them to be messages by the Swarm, as evidenced by her amulet which bears the Locust symbol. Marcus then has Kait and Del find answers at the New Hope facility. After discovering New Hope and an additional lab in Mount Kadar, Kait and Del learn that the Locust were the result of genetic experiments done to human children sick with Rustlung and splicing them with the DNA of creatures in the Hollow. The mutant children, known as Sires, were then used to fertilize the stem cells of Myrrah, who was born with a genetic immunity to Imulsion. Kait then discovers that Myrrah was Reyna's mother, making Kait the next in line for Queen of the Swarm. She manages to disconnect herself from the Swarm hivemind, but in doing allowed Reyna to be awoken and become queen of the Swarm. The Swarm becomes stronger and more intelligent now that they have a queen and launch an attack against New Ephyra. Using the Hammer of Dawn, the COG is able to repel the Swarm attack, and Kait vows to kill Queen Reyna before she can attack again.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Gearsofwar108.jpg|thumb|right|Marcus Fenix, the player-controlled character, takes aim at a Locust Drone with a Lancer from behind [[Cover system|cover]]. The game uses an over-the-shoulder camera angle when displaying the targeting reticle.]]\n''Gears of War'' is a [[third-person shooter]] game, with its core concepts being derived from ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''{{'}}s \"over the shoulder\" perspective, ''[[Kill Switch (video game)|Kill Switch]]''{{'}}s [[Cover System (gaming)|cover system]], and ''[[Bionic Commando (arcade)|Bionic Commando]]''{{'}}s swinging action akin to moving between points of cover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6167213.html?action=convert&om_clk=latestnews&tag=latestnews;title;0|title=GameSpot \u2013 GDC 07: Cliffy B disassembles ''Gears'', mentions sequel|accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref>  The series focuses on using cover to tactically engage the enemy in battle to avoid taking damage. While behind cover, the player can fire blindly and inaccurately at their opponent, or can look around the cover and aim carefully, though exposing himself to enemy fire; the player can also slide along cover, move between nearby cover, or vault over cover to race to a new point of cover. As the player takes damage, the \"Crimson Omen\" appears on the [[head up display|HUD]], becoming more defined as the player nears low health levels. The player can regenerate their health by staying out of harm's way for a short while. Should the player take too much damage, they will become incapacitated unless revived by a teammate; depending on game mode, the player may be able to recover from this state on their own, or may die after a short amount of time if not revived. When a combatant is down, a member of the other side may also attempt to execute the downed player via a \"curb stomp\" or other brutal methods. As well, some types of damage will immediately kill the player with no chance of revival, such as explosive damage. There are five levels on the first two games, but they are referred to as \"acts\" and each act is formed into a certain amount of chapters.\n\nPlayers in ''Gears'' can only carry four different weapons, with the exception of the fourth game, allowing two primary weapon slots that can carry weapons which include, but are not limited to: assault rifles, shotguns, a [[sniper rifle]], grenade launchers and an explosive [[bow and arrow|bow]]; one grenade slot, which may be filled with up to four grenades of a specific type (Fragmentation, Smoke, Ink and Incendiary), and one pistol-type weapon. Players can either obtain ammo or swap out their current weapons with any weapon dropped by a downed foe or from those scattered around the various maps. Most weapons feature the \"Active Reload\" ability: either after a weapon has depleted an ammo magazine or when the player starts a manual reload, a meter is shown on screen, and the player can attempt to stop the meter in a certain marked area. If the player stops the meter in the marked area, their reload will be completed faster than if they did not attempt an Active Reload, and if the player can stop the meter at a specific section of the marked area, they will gain a temporary slight damage boost with each reloaded shot and a faster reload. If the player stops the meter outside this area, their gun will become temporarily jammed and slow down the reload time. While most of the weapons are based on standard shooter archetypes, ''Gears''{{'}}s signature weapon is the Lancer, an assault rifle that has a mounted [[chainsaw]] [[bayonet]] which can be used in close quarter combat to instantly kill a standard foe. Most other weapons also can be used to bash opponents in melee, or in the case of grenades, can be stuck to a foe, exploding a few seconds later. In ''Gears of War 2'' and ''3'', all four types of grenades can be planted on any reachable surface, detonating when an opponent comes close to it. If the opponent spots the grenade, they can detonate it from a safe distance by shooting it.\n\nAll ''Gears'' games feature a campaign mode that can be played cooperatively with one other player. The two players take the roles of two COG soldiers, Marcus Fenix and Dominic \"Dom\" Santiago, as they fight the Locust. In the third game the campaign allows for up to four players to play together at the same time. The campaign mode features several levels of difficulty. At various times, the campaign will offer a choice of paths the first player can select; if the second player is present, they will be forced to take the other path. The third and fourth players in Gears of War 3 will be separated between the paths of the first and second players. In these areas, all players generally have to work together to get them through the section, such as by one player providing covering fire while the second player opens a switch that allows the first player to then proceed.\n\nThe competitive multiplayer mode in Gears 1 features 8 players while in Gears 2 features up to ten players split between COG and Locust forces in a number of gameplay types. Modes include \"Warzone\" and \"Execution\", both similar to a typical [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]], and \"Annex\" and \"King of the Hill\" where teams have to control a marked zone on the map. In the mode \"Guardian,\"(only in Gears 2) one member of each team is designated as the leader. As long as the leader is still alive, his or her teammates can respawn indefinitely. As soon as the leader is executed, his or her teammates can no longer respawn.\n\n''Gears of War 3'' features better AI, as in past games the AI went around the obstacle even if it had been destroyed. However, in ''Gears 3'' the AI will recognize that the obstacle has been destroyed and are free to walk over it.<ref>\"''Gears of War 3'',\" ''Game Informer'' 206 (June 2010): p40-49.</ref>\n\n==Games==\n{{VG timeline\n| 2006 = ''[[Gears of War (video game)|Gears of War]]''\n| 2008 = ''[[Gears of War 2]]''\n| 2011 = ''[[Gears of War 3]]''\n| 2013 = ''[[Gears of War: Judgment]]''\n| 2014 = Acquisition of series by Microsoft from Epic Games\n| 2015 = ''[[Gears of War (video game)#Ultimate Edition|Gears of War: Ultimate Edition]]''\n| 2016 = ''[[Gears of War 4]]''\n| 2019a = ''[[Gears Pop]]''\n| 2019b = ''[[Gears 5]]''\n| 2020a = ''[[Gears Tactics]]''\n}}\n\n===Main series===\n====''Gears of War''====\n{{Main|Gears of War (video game)}}\n''Gears of War'' is a [[third-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Epic Games]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios]].

These are controlled by an [[AI]] deck of cards: after each player finishes their turn, they draw a card from the AI deck and takes actions for each Locust creature. Players play cards and roll dice to take actions as well as to resolve shooting and defense. The game proceeds until the player team successfully completes the mission.

The series focuses on the conflict between humanity, the subterranean reptilian hominids known as the Locust Horde, and their mutated counterparts, the Lambent. The franchise consists of six third-person shooter video games, which has also been supplemented by a comic book series and five novels.\n\nThe first installment, titled ''[[Gears of War (video game)|Gears of War]]'', was released on November 7, 2006 for the [[Xbox 360]]. The game follows protagonist [[Marcus Fenix]], a soldier in the Coalition of Ordered Governments tasked to lead a last-ditch effort to destroy the Locust Horde and save humanity. Two subsequent titles, ''[[Gears of War 2]]'' (2008) and ''[[Gears of War 3]]'' (2011), continued Fenix and humanity's ongoing conflict with the Locust Horde and Lambent forces. In 2013, Epic Games and Microsoft released ''[[Gears of War: Judgment]]'', a prequel to the series\u2019 first title, which instead focuses on Damon Baird, one of Fenix's squad-mates.<ref>{{cite news | first = Mitch | last = Dyer | title = Trial By Fire | date = 2013-03-17 | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/18/gears-of-war-judgment-review | work = [[IGN]] | accessdate = 2014-02-02}}</ref> ''Gears of War: Ultimate Edition'' was released for Microsoft Windows on March 1, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2015/06/gears-war-ultimate-edition-killer-instinct-coming-windows-10 |title=Gears of War: Ultimate Edition and Killer Instinct coming to Windows 10 |publisher=Gematsu |date=2014-07-31 |accessdate=2015-06-25}}</ref> The series' third sequel, ''[[Gears of War 4]]'', is set 25 years after ''Gears of War 3'' and follows Marcus Fenix's son, JD, as he battles a new resurrected Locust Horde that once again threatens humanity.<ref name=GOW4>{{cite web|url=http://www.dualshockers.com/2016/03/08/gears-of-war-4-gets-tons-of-new-details-on-game-informer/|title=Gears of War 4 Gets Tons of New Details on Game Informer|accessdate=April 8, 2016|website=DualShockers}}</ref> ''[[Gears 5]]'' (2019) revolves around Kait, a friend of JD, who embarks on a quest to learn her true origin and relation to the Locust Horde.\n\n''Gears of War'' was developed by Epic Games.

Human civilization develops on Sera and endures a millennia-long conflict that leaves humanity on the brink of extinction. Sera's leaders broker an era of peace that ushers an era of scientific advancements and a cultural renaissance. Humanity's population sporadically grows and demands more energy provided by [[fossil fuel|fossil]] and [[nuclear power|nuclear fuels]]. Sera's scientists discover Imulsion, a naturally occurring substance that can be refined into a potent energy source. Imulsion solves Sera's energy crisis but ultimately creates great economic disparity. Nations with direct access to Imulsion prosper, while other nations fall into financial turmoil.\n  \nSera's citizens [[balkanize]] into two warring factions: the Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG) and Union of Independent Republics (UIR). The ensuing 79-year strife, known as the Pendulum Wars, consumes millions of lives with both sides locked in a virtual stalemate. The UIR develops the 'Hammer of Dawn', a system of satellites capable of delivering precise and potent orbital-to-surface laser strikes. However, a contingent of COG commandos, led by [[Marcus Fenix]], Dominic Santiago, and Victor Hoffman launch a daring raid on a UIR stronghold and steal the schematics for the Hammer of Dawn. The UIR quickly surrenders after witnessing the Hammer of Dawn devastate one of their naval vessels after being completed by Marcus Fenix's father, scientist Adam Fenix.\n \nSix weeks after the COG and UIR agreed to an armistice, a race of creatures known as the Locust Horde unexpectedly emerge from Sera's depths and begin assaulting all human cities, wiping out 25% of the world population in the first 26 hours. The Locust Horde easily overwhelms the already battleworn COG forces during this surprise attack, referred to as 'Emergence Day'. The COG retreats to cities located on the Jacinto Plateau, their last bastion where the Locust cannot dig through, and reluctantly bombard their own cities with the Hammer of Dawn to halt the Locust Horde's offensive. The ensuing [[scorched earth]] tactic destroys much of Sera's cities and human population. The COG continues to operate out of the capital city of Ephyra and cities on the plateau such as Jacinto, while the surviving humans, known as Stranded, are left to wander through Sera's charred ruins. \n\nFive years after Emergence Day, the Locust reemerge and begin a campaign of occupying human cities located on the Jacinto Plateau to act as stepping stones in order to destroy Ephyra. Eventually, the Locust are able to emerge and overrun the COG capital of Ephyra ten years after Emergence Day. During the chaos, Marcus Fenix leads an unauthorized mission to save his father, Adam, from the Locust assault. However, a King Raven helicopter is shot down by the Locust Horde and crash-lands into the Fenix Estate, presumably killing Adam Fenix. The COG's leadership [[court martial]]s Marcus and sentences him to life imprisonment. After losing Ephyra, the remainder of the COG retreats to Jacinto City, which resides on the edge of the plateau against an ocean. \n\n''[[Gears of War (video game)|Gears of War]]'' is set fourteen years after the Locust emerged and attacked Sera's human population. The COG forces devise a last-ditch offensive to destroy the Locust Horde with the Lightmass Bomb, weaponized forms of Imulsion. Marcus Fenix, now a disgraced veteran, is reinstated into the COG army four years after imprisonment to supplement the COG's depleted ranks. Marcus joins his best friend, Dominic Santiago, on a mission to map the Locust Horde's tunnel network in preparation for the bombing. However, their unit is ambushed by Locust Ground forces and sustain heavy casualties. Fenix and Santiago regroup with two other survivors, Augustus Cole and Damon Baird, and continue their mission. Marcus ultimately prevails in not only mapping, but successfully deploying the Lightmass Bomb and crippling the Locust Horde. However, the Locust Queen, Myrrah, pledges to continue the war effort. \n\nIn the weeks following the Lightmass Bombing, the human population begins suffering from a condition known as Rustlung, a fatal disease caused by the inhalation of Imulsion fumes - due to the evaporation of Imulsion caused by the Lightmass Bomb. The Locust reemerge and brought with them a force allowing them to sink the cities on the Jacinto Plateau. Following the sinking of nearby cities Tollen and Montevado, and the desperate raid attacks on Jacinto City, the COG fears that the Locust might be trying to sink Jacinto as well. \n\nIn ''[[Gears of War 2]]'', the COG Forces in-turn deploy thousands of soldiers directly into the depths of Sera to directly battle the Locust Horde and stop their plans to sink Jacinto. The COG discovers after the sinking of Ilima City that the Locust have been using a gargantuan worm to sink the cities on the Jacinto Plateau. After killing the Riftworm, Delta Squad is then ordered to locate the Locust stronghold by accessing intel from a decommissioned COG laboratory called New Hope, which is full of genetically altered humans called Sires, which Marcus believes were experiments that led to the creation of the Locust Horde. Locating the Locust stronghold, Nexus, under Mount Kadar - the COG discovers during the battle that members of the Locust Horde are mutating from exposure from Imulsion into \u2018Lambent\u2019. These abominations have been forcing the Locust to abandon their underground civilization to try to claim the surface world as their new home. Marcus devises a plan to intentionally sink Jacinto and using the surrounding sea water to flood the Locust and Lambent tunnel network. The COG evacuate Jacinto just as the city collapses and drowns a majority of the Locust Horde.\n\nThe remaining population of the COG rediscover an island base never attacked by the Locust Horde called Vectes, with a town known as Pelruan. The Stranded gangs on the island threaten the safety of the town, but the COG and Stranded cease when the Lambent begin to overrun the island and surrounding ocean. Due to the underground being flooded, the Imulsion from the Hollow was raised into the surface of Sera, causing a pandemic and turning all life into Lambent organisms. The leader of the COG, Chairman Richard Prescott, is believed to be holding secrets from the population. Prescott then abandons the COG, forcing them to disband and live as nomads, surviving against the Lambent and Locust stragglers. \n\n''[[Gears of War 3]]'' is set seventeen years after Emergence Day. Set two years after the COG disbanded, Prescott returns to reveal that he kidnapped Marcus Fenix's father during the fall of Ephyra and transported him to a secret island facility known as Azura, and that Adam has created a device known as the Imulsion countermeasure that could neutralize both the Lambent and Locust. However, the island was attacked and is now occupied by Queen Myrrah and the remaining Locust forces. Marcus and his allies reach Azura after Dominic sacrifices himself to rescue his friends from imminent demise.  Adam is rescued and releases his anti-Imulsion weapon but reveals he infected himself with the Lambent contagion to develop the weapon. The Imulsion countermeasure vaporizes all Lambent, including Adam, and the crystallizes the Locust.  Marcus personally kills Myrrah and dedicates her demise to his fallen friends, family, and comrades.  \n\n''[[Gears of War: Judgment]]'', focuses on Baird and Cole during the early months after Emergence Day. With military cadet Sofia Hendrick and Garron Paduk, a former UIR soldier, they comprise the Kilo Squad. Baird disobeys orders to use a Lightmass Missile to destroy Locust forces and save survivors at Halvo Bay. Despite also killing the powerful Locust leader Karn, the squad is court-martialed because they disobeyed orders. But because they saved Col. Ezra Loomis and killed Karn, they avoid execution or imprisonment, with Baird demoted from lieutenant to private. A separate campaign, \"Aftermath\", portrays Baird, Cole, and Paduk in the hours before the activation of the anti-Imulsion energy wave.\n\nFollowing the end of the Locust War and Lambent Pandemic, the humans of Sera began to rebuild and started with reorganizing the Coalition of Ordered Governments. Led by First Minister Anya Stroud, wife of Marcus Fenix, the humans begin to rebuild civilization with the assistance of robotic engineers created by Damon Baird. The COG was successful in creating New Ephyra and other walled cities known as Settlements outside of New Ephyra. Following fertility treatment, Anya was able to bear Marcus Fenix's son, James Dominic \"JD\" Fenix. However, Anya later died from birthing complications and the COG began a more authoritarian rule - prompting many civilians to abandon the COG and live off the land, known as Outsiders. JD was then sent to boarding school and met best friend Delmont \"Del\" Walker. After joining the military, both JD and Del were forced to execute civilians during a protest in Settlement 2, prompting them to leave the COG and becoming Outsiders. They joined a village led by Reyna Diaz and her brother-in-law, Oscar. Reyna's daughter, Kait, became close with JD and Del.  \n\n''[[Gears of War 4]]'' takes place 25 years after the original ''Gears of War'' trilogy. JD, accompanied by Kait and Del, conduct frequent raids on COG fortifications to acquire various supplies. The three successfully fend off a COG counterattack only to have their encampment devastated by a new foe, called the Swarm. Kait's mother, Reyna, is captured during the chaos. JD, Kait, and Del reach out to Marcus, now a disgruntled COG expatriate, who reluctantly agrees to help them. The COG, led by First Minister Mina Jinn, pursue the group after erroneously believing they are behind a string of mass-kidnappings.  The four reach a Locust mass-burial site, where they uncover evidence suggesting that Adam Fenix's countermeasure caused the Locust Horde to enter a cocooned metamorphosis state. Their fears are confirmed when various Locust Horde soldiers attack them in conjunction with the Swarm. The group receives assistance from Damon Baird along with Augustus Cole and Samantha Byrne. They battle their way to the Swarm's hive and defeat multiple Swarm and Locust monstrosities.  However, they reach the hive to learn that Swarm's hive-mind has forcefully integrated with Reyna. Kait frees her mother, knowing she will die but will no longer suffer. Reyna gives Kait a parting gift that belonged to her mother \u2013 a necklace bearing the insignia of the Locust Queen, Myrrah.\n\nKait, JD, Del, and Marcus rejoin the COG and offer their intelligence to Jinn in order to help fight the Swarm. However, Kait begins to have nightmares and visions related to her mother, the Swarm, and the Locust - but refuses to tell the others about it. Marcus and Baird believe they will need the Hammer of Dawn back online to help defend against the upcoming war with the Swarm. Baird then uncovers additional Hammer of Dawn satellites at Azura. \n\nIn ''[[Gears 5]]'', JD, Kait, Del, and Marcus travel to Azura to launch the Hammer of Dawn satellites. Afterwards, they assist in the evacuation of Settlement 2 as the Swarm have begun their attack on COG Settlements. Four months later, Kait is captured by the Swarm and connects her to the Swarm hivemind, allowing her to control the Swarm to kill the humans, including her uncle. She's freed by Marcus and JD, but in her grief reveals that she's been having visions and nightmare and believes them to be messages by the Swarm, as evidenced by her amulet which bears the Locust symbol. Marcus then has Kait and Del find answers at the New Hope facility. After discovering New Hope and an additional lab in Mount Kadar, Kait and Del learn that the Locust were the result of genetic experiments done to human children sick with Rustlung and splicing them with the DNA of creatures in the Hollow. The mutant children, known as Sires, were then used to fertilize the stem cells of Myrrah, who was born with a genetic immunity to Imulsion. Kait then discovers that Myrrah was Reyna's mother, making Kait the next in line for Queen of the Swarm. She manages to disconnect herself from the Swarm hivemind, but in doing allowed Reyna to be awoken and become queen of the Swarm. The Swarm becomes stronger and more intelligent now that they have a queen and launch an attack against New Ephyra. Using the Hammer of Dawn, the COG is able to repel the Swarm attack, and Kait vows to kill Queen Reyna before she can attack again.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Gearsofwar108.jpg|thumb|right|Marcus Fenix, the player-controlled character, takes aim at a Locust Drone with a Lancer from behind [[Cover system|cover]]. The game uses an over-the-shoulder camera angle when displaying the targeting reticle.]]\n''Gears of War'' is a [[third-person shooter]] game, with its core concepts being derived from ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''{{'}}s \"over the shoulder\" perspective, ''[[Kill Switch (video game)|Kill Switch]]''{{'}}s [[Cover System (gaming)|cover system]], and ''[[Bionic Commando (arcade)|Bionic Commando]]''{{'}}s swinging action akin to moving between points of cover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6167213.html?action=convert&om_clk=latestnews&tag=latestnews;title;0|title=GameSpot \u2013 GDC 07: Cliffy B disassembles ''Gears'', mentions sequel|accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref>  The series focuses on using cover to tactically engage the enemy in battle to avoid taking damage. While behind cover, the player can fire blindly and inaccurately at their opponent, or can look around the cover and aim carefully, though exposing himself to enemy fire; the player can also slide along cover, move between nearby cover, or vault over cover to race to a new point of cover. As the player takes damage, the \"Crimson Omen\" appears on the [[head up display|HUD]], becoming more defined as the player nears low health levels. The player can regenerate their health by staying out of harm's way for a short while. Should the player take too much damage, they will become incapacitated unless revived by a teammate; depending on game mode, the player may be able to recover from this state on their own, or may die after a short amount of time if not revived. When a combatant is down, a member of the other side may also attempt to execute the downed player via a \"curb stomp\" or other brutal methods. As well, some types of damage will immediately kill the player with no chance of revival, such as explosive damage. There are five levels on the first two games, but they are referred to as \"acts\" and each act is formed into a certain amount of chapters.\n\nPlayers in ''Gears'' can only carry four different weapons, with the exception of the fourth game, allowing two primary weapon slots that can carry weapons which include, but are not limited to: assault rifles, shotguns, a [[sniper rifle]], grenade launchers and an explosive [[bow and arrow|bow]]; one grenade slot, which may be filled with up to four grenades of a specific type (Fragmentation, Smoke, Ink and Incendiary), and one pistol-type weapon. Players can either obtain ammo or swap out their current weapons with any weapon dropped by a downed foe or from those scattered around the various maps. Most weapons feature the \"Active Reload\" ability: either after a weapon has depleted an ammo magazine or when the player starts a manual reload, a meter is shown on screen, and the player can attempt to stop the meter in a certain marked area. If the player stops the meter in the marked area, their reload will be completed faster than if they did not attempt an Active Reload, and if the player can stop the meter at a specific section of the marked area, they will gain a temporary slight damage boost with each reloaded shot and a faster reload. If the player stops the meter outside this area, their gun will become temporarily jammed and slow down the reload time. While most of the weapons are based on standard shooter archetypes, ''Gears''{{'}}s signature weapon is the Lancer, an assault rifle that has a mounted [[chainsaw]] [[bayonet]] which can be used in close quarter combat to instantly kill a standard foe. Most other weapons also can be used to bash opponents in melee, or in the case of grenades, can be stuck to a foe, exploding a few seconds later. In ''Gears of War 2'' and ''3'', all four types of grenades can be planted on any reachable surface, detonating when an opponent comes close to it. If the opponent spots the grenade, they can detonate it from a safe distance by shooting it.\n\nAll ''Gears'' games feature a campaign mode that can be played cooperatively with one other player. The two players take the roles of two COG soldiers, Marcus Fenix and Dominic \"Dom\" Santiago, as they fight the Locust. In the third game the campaign allows for up to four players to play together at the same time. The campaign mode features several levels of difficulty. At various times, the campaign will offer a choice of paths the first player can select; if the second player is present, they will be forced to take the other path. The third and fourth players in Gears of War 3 will be separated between the paths of the first and second players. In these areas, all players generally have to work together to get them through the section, such as by one player providing covering fire while the second player opens a switch that allows the first player to then proceed.\n\nThe competitive multiplayer mode in Gears 1 features 8 players while in Gears 2 features up to ten players split between COG and Locust forces in a number of gameplay types. Modes include \"Warzone\" and \"Execution\", both similar to a typical [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]], and \"Annex\" and \"King of the Hill\" where teams have to control a marked zone on the map. In the mode \"Guardian,\"(only in Gears 2) one member of each team is designated as the leader. As long as the leader is still alive, his or her teammates can respawn indefinitely. As soon as the leader is executed, his or her teammates can no longer respawn.\n\n''Gears of War 3'' features better AI, as in past games the AI went around the obstacle even if it had been destroyed. However, in ''Gears 3'' the AI will recognize that the obstacle has been destroyed and are free to walk over it.<ref>\"''Gears of War 3'',\" ''Game Informer'' 206 (June 2010): p40-49.</ref>\n\n==Games==\n{{VG timeline\n| 2006 = ''[[Gears of War (video game)|Gears of War]]''\n| 2008 = ''[[Gears of War 2]]''\n| 2011 = ''[[Gears of War 3]]''\n| 2013 = ''[[Gears of War: Judgment]]''\n| 2014 = Acquisition of series by Microsoft from Epic Games\n| 2015 = ''[[Gears of War (video game)#Ultimate Edition|Gears of War: Ultimate Edition]]''\n| 2016 = ''[[Gears of War 4]]''\n| 2019a = ''[[Gears Pop]]''\n| 2019b = ''[[Gears 5]]''\n| 2020a = ''[[Gears Tactics]]''\n}}\n\n===Main series===\n====''Gears of War''====\n{{Main|Gears of War (video game)}}\n''Gears of War'' is a [[third-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Epic Games]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios]].

Designed by Corey Konieczka, it is a [[cooperative game]] for up to four players, including the option for solo play. Each player takes control of a COG (represented by a miniature figure pre-painted in red), fighting their way through randomly generated maps filled with Locust soldiers (represented by a miniature figure pre-painted in light gray). These are controlled by an [[AI]] deck of cards: after each player finishes their turn, they draw a card from the AI deck and takes actions for each Locust creature. Players play cards and roll dice to take actions as well as to resolve shooting and defense. The game proceeds until the player team successfully completes the mission. There are seven different missions, each featuring different objectives and enemies in randomly generated map layouts. Since its launch, the game has received one expansion, ''Mission Pack 1'', which brought more weapons, two new missions and new enemies, including General RAAM.\n\n===Books===\nA series of novels based on the ''Gears of War'' series were written by [[Karen Traviss]].

Issue 7, \"The Quickening\", followed the life of [[List of Gears of War characters#Tai Kaliso|Tai Kaliso]] from his home in the South Islands to the torture den of the Locust Horde. This was released on June 9, 2009.\n\nThe second stand-alone was \"[[Gears of War (comics)#\"Harper's Story\"|Harper's Story]]\". In ''Gears of War 2'' there are collectibles which describe the end of Sgt. Jonathan Harper, a Gears veteran. He was captured by the Locust during the events of the Hollow.

He helped a family reach safety, taking the bullets into his own body before falling to the ground.\n\nIssue number 9 begins a new arc, \"[[Gears of War (comics)#\"Barren\"|Barren]]\", of which the first part was released in September 2009.

His ambitions were great and he was able to buy a country estate and a ship (as well as [[civet]]s to make perfume), though he was rarely out of debt.

By 1695, he was back in England, now formally using the name \"Defoe\" and serving as a \"commissioner of the glass duty\", responsible for collecting taxes on bottles. In 1696, he ran a tile and brick factory in what is now [[Tilbury]] in [[History of Essex|Essex]] and lived in the parish of [[Chadwell St Mary]].\n\n== Writing ==\n\nAs many as 545 titles have been [[wikiwikiweb:ascribe|ascribed]] to Defoe, ranging from satirical poems, political and religious pamphlets, and volumes. ([[P. N. Furbank|Furbank]] and Owens argue for the much smaller number of 276 published items in ''Critical Bibliography'' (1998).)\n\n=== Pamphleteering and prison ===\n[[File:Daniel Defoe by James Charles Armytage.jpg|thumb|Daniel Defoe in the [[pillory]], 1862 line engraving by [[James Charles Armytage]] after [[Eyre Crowe (painter)|Eyre Crowe]]]]\n\nDefoe's first notable publication was ''[[An essay upon projects]]'', a series of proposals for social and economic improvement, published in 1697. From 1697 to 1698, he defended the right of King [[William III of England|William III]] to a [[standing army]] during disarmament, after the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] (1697) had ended the [[Nine Years' War]] (1688\u20131697). His most successful poem, ''[[The True-Born Englishman]]'' (1701), defended the king against the perceived xenophobia of his enemies, satirising the English claim to racial purity. In 1701, Defoe presented the ''Legion's Memorial'' to [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], then [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]]\u2014and his subsequent employer\u2014while flanked by a guard of sixteen gentlemen of quality. It demanded the release of the Kentish petitioners, who had asked Parliament to support the king in an imminent war against France.\n\nThe death of [[William III of England|William III]] in 1702 once again created a political upheaval, as the king was replaced by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] who immediately began her offensive against [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformists]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\" /> Defoe was a natural target, and his pamphleteering and political activities resulted in his arrest and placement in a [[pillory]] on 31 July 1703, principally on account of his December 1702 pamphlet entitled ''[[The Shortest Way with the Dissenters|The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters; Or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church]]'', purporting to argue for their extermination.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/27/12.html|author=Daniel Defoe|year=1702|title=The shortest way with the Dissenters|accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> In it, he ruthlessly satirised both the [[High church]] [[Tory|Tories]] and those [[Dissenter]]s who hypocritically practised so-called \"occasional conformity\", such as his [[Stoke Newington]] neighbour Sir [[Thomas Abney]]. It was published anonymously, but the true authorship was quickly discovered and Defoe was arrested.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\" /> He was charged with seditious libel and found guilty in a trial at the [[Old Bailey]] in front of the notoriously sadistic judge [[Salathiel Lovell]].<ref name=\"Letters to John Law\" /> Lovell sentenced him to a punitive fine of 200 [[Mark (currency)|marks]], to public humiliation in a [[pillory]], and to an indeterminate length of imprisonment which would only end upon the discharge of the punitive fine.<ref name=\"Letters to John Law\" /> According to legend, the publication of his poem ''Hymn to the Pillory'' caused his audience at the pillory to throw flowers instead of the customary harmful and noxious objects and to drink to his health. The truth of this story is questioned by most scholars, although [[John Robert Moore]] later said that \"no man in England but Defoe ever stood in the pillory and later rose to eminence among his fellow men\".<ref name = rich/>\n{{Quote box\n |quote = \"Wherever God erects a house of prayer<br />the Devil always builds a chapel there;<br />And 't will be found, upon examination,<br />the latter has the largest congregation.\"\n |source = \u2014 Defoe's ''The True-Born Englishman'', 1701\n}}\n\nAfter his three days in the pillory, Defoe went into [[Newgate Prison]]. [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]], brokered his release in exchange for Defoe's co-operation as an intelligence agent for the Tories. In exchange for such co-operation with the rival political side, Harley paid some of Defoe's outstanding debts, improving his financial situation considerably.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\" />\n\nWithin a week of his release from prison, Defoe witnessed the [[Great Storm of 1703]], which raged through the night of 26/27 November. It caused severe damage to London and [[Bristol]], uprooted millions of trees, and killed more than 8,000 people, mostly at sea. The event became the subject of Defoe's ''[[The Storm (Daniel Defoe)|The Storm]]'' (1704), which includes a collection of witness accounts of the tempest.<ref>''The Storm: or, a collection of the most remarkable casualties and disasters which happen'd in the late dreadful tempest, both by sea and land''. London: 1704.</ref> Many regard it as one of the world's first examples of modern journalism.<ref>[[John J. Miller (journalist)|John J.

The ''Review'' ran three times a week without interruption until 1713. Defoe was amazed that a man as gifted as Harley left vital state papers lying in the open, and warned that he was almost inviting an unscrupulous clerk to commit treason; his warnings were fully justified by the [[William Gregg (clerk and spy)|William Gregg]] affair.\n\nWhen Harley was ousted from the ministry in 1708, Defoe continued writing the ''Review'' to support [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Godolphin]], then again to support Harley and the [[Tory (British political party)|Tories]] in the Tory ministry of 1710\u20131714. The Tories fell from power with the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], but Defoe continued doing intelligence work for the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] government, writing \"Tory\" pamphlets that undermined the Tory point of view.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\" />\n\nNot all of Defoe's pamphlet writing was political. One pamphlet was originally published anonymously, entitled \"''A True Relation of the Apparition of One Mrs. Veal the Next Day after her Death to One Mrs. Bargrave at Canterbury the 8th of September, 1705''.\" It deals with interaction between the spiritual realm and the physical realm and was most likely written in support of [[Charles Drelincourt]]'s ''The Christian Defense against the Fears of Death'' (1651). It describes Mrs. Bargrave's encounter with her old friend Mrs. Veal after she had died. It is clear from this piece and other writings that the political portion of Defoe's life was by no means his only focus.\n\n=== Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707 ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}<!--lots of paragraphs without citations-->\n\n[[File:Defoe 1709 The History Of The Union Of Great Britain.JPG|thumb|Title page from Daniel Defoe's: ''The History of the Union of Great Britain'' dated 1709 and printed in Edinburgh by the Heirs of Anderson]]\nIn despair during his imprisonment for the seditious libel case, Defoe wrote to [[William Paterson (banker)|William Paterson]], the London Scot and founder of the [[Bank of England]] and part instigator of the [[Darien scheme]], who was in the confidence of [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]], leading minister and spymaster in the [[Governance of England|English Government]].

By September 1706, Harley ordered Defoe to [[Edinburgh]] as a secret agent to do everything possible to help secure acquiescence in the [[Treaty of Union]]. He was conscious of the risk to himself. Thanks to books such as ''The Letters of Daniel Defoe'' (edited by G. H. Healey, Oxford 1955), far more is known about his activities than is usual with such agents.\n\nHis first reports included vivid descriptions of violent demonstrations against the Union. \"A Scots rabble is the worst of its kind\", he reported. Years later [[Sir John Clerk, 2nd Baronet|John Clerk of Penicuik]], a leading Unionist, wrote in his memoirs that it was not known at the time that Defoe had been sent by Godolphin : {{quote|\u2026 to give a faithful account to him from time to time how everything past here.

There is not one fact in it which I can challenge\"</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nDefoe was a [[Presbyterian]] who had suffered in England for his convictions, and as such he was accepted as an adviser to the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] and committees of the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. He told Harley that he was \"privy to all their folly\" but \"Perfectly unsuspected as with corresponding with anybody in England\". He was then able to influence the proposals that were put to Parliament and reported,\n\n{{quote|Having had the honour to be always sent for the committee to whom these amendments were referr\u00e8d,<br />I have had the good fortune to break their measures in two particulars via the bounty on Corn and<br />proportion of the Excise.}}\n\nFor Scotland, he used different arguments, even the opposite of those which he used in England, usually ignoring the English doctrine of the [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|Sovereignty of Parliament]], for example, telling the Scots that they could have complete confidence in the guarantees in the Treaty. Some of his pamphlets were purported to be written by Scots, misleading even reputable historians into quoting them as evidence of Scottish opinion of the time. The same is true of a massive history of the Union which Defoe published in 1709 and which some historians still treat as a valuable contemporary source for their own works. Defoe took pains to give his history an air of objectivity by giving some space to arguments against the Union but always having the last word for himself.\n\nHe disposed of the main Union opponent, [[Andrew Fletcher (politician)|Andrew Fletcher]] of [[East Saltoun and West Saltoun|Saltoun]], by ignoring him. Nor does he account for the deviousness of the [[Duke of Hamilton]], the official leader of the various factions opposed to the Union, who seemingly betrayed his former colleagues when he switched to the Unionist/Government side in the decisive final stages of the debate.\n\nDefoe made no attempt to explain why the same Parliament of Scotland which was so vehement for its independence from 1703 to 1705 became so supine in 1706. He received very little reward from his paymasters and of course no recognition for his services by the government. He made use of his Scottish experience to write his ''Tour thro' the whole Island of Great Britain'', published in 1726, where he admitted that the increase of trade and population in Scotland which he had predicted as a consequence of the Union was \"not the case, but rather the contrary\".\n\n[[File:Glasgow Bridge c.1758.JPG|thumb|Glasgow Bridge as Defoe might have seen it in the 18th century]]\nDefoe's description of [[Glasgow]] (Glaschu) as a \"Dear Green Place\" has often been misquoted as a [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] translation for the town's name. The Gaelic ''Glas'' could mean grey or green, while ''chu'' means dog or hollow. ''Glaschu'' probably means \"Green Hollow\". The \"Dear Green Place\", like much of Scotland, was a hotbed of unrest against the Union. The local [[St George's-Tron Church|Tron]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] urged his congregation \"to up and anent for the City of God\".\n\nThe \"Dear Green Place\" and \"City of God\" required government troops to put down the rioters tearing up copies of the Treaty at almost every [[mercat cross]] in Scotland. When Defoe visited in the mid-1720s, he claimed that the hostility towards his party was \"because they were English and because of the Union, which they were almost universally exclaimed against\".{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== Late writing ===\nThe extent and particulars are widely contested concerning Defoe's writing in the period from the Tory fall in 1714 to the publication of ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' in 1719. Defoe comments on the tendency to attribute tracts of uncertain authorship to him in his apologia ''Appeal to Honour and Justice'' (1715), a defence of his part in Harley's Tory ministry (1710\u20131714). Other works that anticipate his novelistic career include ''The Family Instructor'' (1715), a conduct manual on religious duty; ''Minutes of the Negotiations of Monsr. Mesnager'' (1717), in which he impersonates [[Nicolas Mesnager]], the French plenipotentiary who negotiated the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713); and ''A Continuation of the [[Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy]]'' (1718), a satire of European politics and religion, ostensibly written by a [[Muslim]] in Paris.\n\n[[File:Daniel Defoe monument Bunhill Fields.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial to \"Daniel De-Foe\", [[Bunhill Fields]], [[City Road]], [[Borough of Islington]], London]]\n\nFrom 1719 to 1724, Defoe published the novels for which he is famous (see below). In the final decade of his life, he also wrote conduct manuals, including ''Religious Courtship'' (1722), ''The Complete English Tradesman'' (1726) and ''The New Family Instructor'' (1727). He published a number of books decrying the breakdown of the social order, such as ''The Great Law of Subordination Considered'' (1724) and ''Everybody's Business is Nobody's Business'' (1725) and works on the supernatural, like ''[[The Political History of the Devil]]'' (1726), ''A System of Magick'' (1727) and ''An Essay on the History and Reality of Apparitions'' (1727). His works on foreign travel and trade include ''A General History of Discoveries and Improvements'' (1727) and ''Atlas Maritimus and Commercialis'' (1728). Perhaps his greatest achievement, apart from the novels, is the magisterial ''[[A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain]]'' (1724\u20131727), which provided a panoramic survey of British trade on the eve of the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\n====''The Complete English Tradesman''====\n\nPublished in 1726, ''The Complete English Tradesman'' is an example of Defoe's political works. He discusses the role of the tradesman in England in comparison to tradesmen internationally, arguing that the British system of trade is far superior.<ref name=defoe1 /> He also implies that trade is the backbone of the British economy: \"estate's a pond, but trade's a spring.\"<ref name=\"defoe1\">[Defoe, Daniel. The complete English tradesman. London: Tegg, 1841. Print.]</ref> He praises the practicality of trade not only within the economy but the social stratification as well. Most of the British [[gentry]], he argues is at one time or another inextricably linked with the institution of trade, either through personal experience, marriage or genealogy.<ref name=defoe1 /> Oftentimes younger members of noble families entered into trade. Marriage to a tradesman's daughter by a [[nobleman]] was also common. Overall Defoe demonstrated a high respect for '''tradesmen''', being one himself.\n\nNot only does Defoe elevate individual British tradesmen to the level of [[gentleman]], but he praises the entirety of British trade as a superior system.<ref name=defoe1 /> Trade, Defoe argues is a much better catalyst for social and economic change than war. He states that through [[imperialism]] and trade expansion the British empire is able to \"increase commerce at home\" through job creation and increased [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].<ref name= defoe1 /> He states that increased consumption, by laws of supply and demand, increases production and in turn raises wages for the poor therefore lifting part of British society further out of poverty.<ref name=defoe1 />\n\n=== Novels ===\n====''Robinson Crusoe''====\n{{main|Robinson Crusoe}}\nPublished in his late fifties,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Minto |first=William |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924013179902 |title=Daniel Defoe |publisher=Harper & Bros. |year=1879 |location=New York |language=English |oclc=562533988}}</ref> this novel relates the story of a man's shipwreck on a desert island for twenty-eight years and his subsequent adventures.  Throughout its episodic narrative, Crusoe's struggles with faith are apparent as he bargains with God in times of life-threatening crises, but time and again he turns his back after his deliverances. He is finally content with his lot in life, separated from society, following a more genuine conversion experience.\n\nIn the opening pages of ''[[The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe]]'', the author describes how Crusoe settled in [[Bedfordshire]], married and produced a family, and that when his wife died, he went off on these further adventures.  Bedford is also the place where the brother of \"H. F.\" in ''[[A Journal of the Plague Year]]'' retired to avoid the danger of the plague, so that by implication, if these works were not fiction, Defoe's family met Crusoe in Bedford, from whence the information in these books was gathered.  Defoe went to school in Stoke Newington, London, with a friend named Caruso.\n\nThe novel has been assumed to be based in part on the story of the Scottish castaway [[Alexander Selkirk]], who spent four years stranded in the [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]],<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\" /> but this experience is inconsistent with the details of the narrative.  The island Selkirk lived on was named M\u00e1s a Tierra (Closer to Land) at the time and was renamed [[Robinson Crusoe Island]] in 1966. It has been supposed that Defoe may have also been inspired by the Latin or English translation of a book by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]]-Arab Muslim polymath [[Ibn Tufail]], who was known as \"Abubacer\" in Europe. The Latin edition of the book was entitled ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Philosophus Autodidactus]]'' and it was an earlier novel that is also set on a deserted island.<ref>Nawal Muhammad Hassan (1980), ''Hayy bin Yaqzan and Robinson Crusoe: A study of an early Arabic impact on English literature'', Al-Rashid House for Publication.</ref><ref>Cyril Glass\u00e9 (2001), ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', Rowman Altamira, p. 202, {{ISBN|0-7591-0190-6}}.</ref><ref name=\"Amber\">{{Cite journal |last=Amber Haque |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357\u2013377 [369] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z |jstor=27512819}}</ref><ref name=\"Wainwright\">Martin Wainwright (22 March 2003) [http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,918454,00.html Desert island scripts], ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref>\n[[File:Daniel Defoe former house England.jpg|thumb|A house where Defoe once lived, near London, England]]\n\n====''Captain Singleton''====\n\nDefoe's next novel was ''[[Captain Singleton]]'' (1720), an adventure story whose first half covers a traversal of Africa which anticipated subsequent discoveries by [[David Livingstone]] and whose second half taps into the contemporary fascination with [[piracy]]. The novel has been commended for its sensitive depiction of the close relationship between the hero and his religious mentor, [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] William Walters.

The ceaseless chant of doom echoed through a city of emptied streets and filled grave pits. For this was London in the year of 1665, the Year of the Great Plague&nbsp;\u2026 In 1721, when the Black Death again threatened the European Continent, Daniel Defoe wrote \"[[A Journal of the Plague Year]]\" to alert an indifferent populace to the horror that was almost upon them. Through the eyes of a saddler who had chosen to remain while multitudes fled, the master realist vividly depicted a plague-stricken city. He re-enacted the terror of a helpless people caught in a tragedy they could not comprehend: the weak preying on the dying, the strong administering to the sick, the sinful orgies of the cynical, the quiet faith of the pious. With dramatic insight, he captured for all time the death throes of a great city.<p>\u2014 Back cover of the New American Library version of \"A Journal of the Plague Year\"; Signet Classic, 1960</blockquote>\n\n==== ''Colonel Jack'' ====\n\n'''''[[Colonel Jack]]''''' (1722) follows an orphaned boy from a life of poverty and crime to colonial prosperity, military and marital imbroglios, and religious conversion, driven by a problematic notion of becoming a \"gentleman.\"\n\n==== ''Moll Flanders'' ====\nAlso in 1722, Defoe wrote '''''[[Moll Flanders]]''''', another first-person [[picaresque novel]] of the fall and eventual redemption, both material and spiritual, of a lone woman in 17th-century England. The titular heroine appears as a whore, bigamist, and thief, lives in [[Liberty of the Mint|The Mint]], commits adultery and incest, and yet manages to retain the reader's sympathy. Her savvy manipulation of both men and wealth earns her a life of trials but ultimately an ending in reward. Although Moll struggles with the morality of some of her actions and decisions, religion seems to be far from her concerns throughout most of her story. However, like Robinson Crusoe, she finally repents. ''Moll Flanders'' is an important work in the development of the novel, as it challenged the common perception of femininity and gender roles in 18th-century British society.<ref name=\"Novak 2001\" /> More recently it has come to be misunderstood as an example of [[erotica]].<ref name=\"historyextra\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/moll-the-life-and-times-of-moll-flanders/ |title=Moll: The Life and Times of Moll Flanders |website=History Extra |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428084347/https://www.historyextra.com/period/moll-the-life-and-times-of-moll-flanders/ |archive-date=28 April 2019 |access-date=30 May 2018}}</ref><ref>Ann Louise Kibbie,  \"Monstrous generation: the birth of capital in Defoe's Moll Flanders and Roxana.\" ''PMLA''  (1995) 110#5: 1023-1034 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/463027 online].</ref>\n\n==== ''Roxana'' ====\n\n''Moll Flanders'' and Defoe's final novel, '''''[[Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress]]''''' (1724), are examples of the remarkable way in which Defoe seems to inhabit his fictional characters (yet \"drawn from life\"), not least in that they are women. ''Roxana'' narrates the moral and spiritual decline of a high society courtesan. ''Roxana'' differs from other Defoe works because the main character does not exhibit a conversion experience, even though she claims to be a penitent later in her life, at the time that she is relaying her story.\n\n== Death ==\n[[File:Bunhill Fields, London 13.JPG|thumb|[[Bunhill Fields]] monument detail]]\nDaniel Defoe died on 24 April 1731, probably while in hiding from his creditors.

By 1695, he was back in England, now formally using the name \"Defoe\" and serving as a \"commissioner of the glass duty\", responsible for collecting taxes on bottles. In 1696, he ran a tile and brick factory in what is now [[Tilbury]] in [[History of Essex|Essex]] and lived in the parish of [[Chadwell St Mary]].\n\n== Writing ==\n\nAs many as 545 titles have been [[wikiwikiweb:ascribe|ascribed]] to Defoe, ranging from satirical poems, political and religious pamphlets, and volumes. ([[P. N. Furbank|Furbank]] and Owens argue for the much smaller number of 276 published items in ''Critical Bibliography'' (1998).)\n\n=== Pamphleteering and prison ===\n[[File:Daniel Defoe by James Charles Armytage.jpg|thumb|Daniel Defoe in the [[pillory]], 1862 line engraving by [[James Charles Armytage]] after [[Eyre Crowe (painter)|Eyre Crowe]]]]\n\nDefoe's first notable publication was ''[[An essay upon projects]]'', a series of proposals for social and economic improvement, published in 1697. From 1697 to 1698, he defended the right of King [[William III of England|William III]] to a [[standing army]] during disarmament, after the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] (1697) had ended the [[Nine Years' War]] (1688\u20131697). His most successful poem, ''[[The True-Born Englishman]]'' (1701), defended the king against the perceived xenophobia of his enemies, satirising the English claim to racial purity. In 1701, Defoe presented the ''Legion's Memorial'' to [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], then [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]]\u2014and his subsequent employer\u2014while flanked by a guard of sixteen gentlemen of quality. It demanded the release of the Kentish petitioners, who had asked Parliament to support the king in an imminent war against France.\n\nThe death of [[William III of England|William III]] in 1702 once again created a political upheaval, as the king was replaced by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] who immediately began her offensive against [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformists]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\" /> Defoe was a natural target, and his pamphleteering and political activities resulted in his arrest and placement in a [[pillory]] on 31 July 1703, principally on account of his December 1702 pamphlet entitled ''[[The Shortest Way with the Dissenters|The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters; Or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church]]'', purporting to argue for their extermination.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/27/12.html|author=Daniel Defoe|year=1702|title=The shortest way with the Dissenters|accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref> In it, he ruthlessly satirised both the [[High church]] [[Tory|Tories]] and those [[Dissenter]]s who hypocritically practised so-called \"occasional conformity\", such as his [[Stoke Newington]] neighbour Sir [[Thomas Abney]]. It was published anonymously, but the true authorship was quickly discovered and Defoe was arrested.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\" /> He was charged with seditious libel and found guilty in a trial at the [[Old Bailey]] in front of the notoriously sadistic judge [[Salathiel Lovell]].<ref name=\"Letters to John Law\" /> Lovell sentenced him to a punitive fine of 200 [[Mark (currency)|marks]], to public humiliation in a [[pillory]], and to an indeterminate length of imprisonment which would only end upon the discharge of the punitive fine.<ref name=\"Letters to John Law\" /> According to legend, the publication of his poem ''Hymn to the Pillory'' caused his audience at the pillory to throw flowers instead of the customary harmful and noxious objects and to drink to his health. The truth of this story is questioned by most scholars, although [[John Robert Moore]] later said that \"no man in England but Defoe ever stood in the pillory and later rose to eminence among his fellow men\".<ref name = rich/>\n{{Quote box\n |quote = \"Wherever God erects a house of prayer<br />the Devil always builds a chapel there;<br />And 't will be found, upon examination,<br />the latter has the largest congregation.\"\n |source = \u2014 Defoe's ''The True-Born Englishman'', 1701\n}}\n\nAfter his three days in the pillory, Defoe went into [[Newgate Prison]]. [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]], brokered his release in exchange for Defoe's co-operation as an intelligence agent for the Tories. In exchange for such co-operation with the rival political side, Harley paid some of Defoe's outstanding debts, improving his financial situation considerably.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\" />\n\nWithin a week of his release from prison, Defoe witnessed the [[Great Storm of 1703]], which raged through the night of 26/27 November. It caused severe damage to London and [[Bristol]], uprooted millions of trees, and killed more than 8,000 people, mostly at sea. The event became the subject of Defoe's ''[[The Storm (Daniel Defoe)|The Storm]]'' (1704), which includes a collection of witness accounts of the tempest.<ref>''The Storm: or, a collection of the most remarkable casualties and disasters which happen'd in the late dreadful tempest, both by sea and land''.

The ''Review'' ran three times a week without interruption until 1713. Defoe was amazed that a man as gifted as Harley left vital state papers lying in the open, and warned that he was almost inviting an unscrupulous clerk to commit treason; his warnings were fully justified by the [[William Gregg (clerk and spy)|William Gregg]] affair.\n\nWhen Harley was ousted from the ministry in 1708, Defoe continued writing the ''Review'' to support [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Godolphin]], then again to support Harley and the [[Tory (British political party)|Tories]] in the Tory ministry of 1710\u20131714. The Tories fell from power with the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], but Defoe continued doing intelligence work for the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] government, writing \"Tory\" pamphlets that undermined the Tory point of view.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\" />\n\nNot all of Defoe's pamphlet writing was political. One pamphlet was originally published anonymously, entitled \"''A True Relation of the Apparition of One Mrs. Veal the Next Day after her Death to One Mrs. Bargrave at Canterbury the 8th of September, 1705''.\" It deals with interaction between the spiritual realm and the physical realm and was most likely written in support of [[Charles Drelincourt]]'s ''The Christian Defense against the Fears of Death'' (1651). It describes Mrs. Bargrave's encounter with her old friend Mrs. Veal after she had died. It is clear from this piece and other writings that the political portion of Defoe's life was by no means his only focus.\n\n=== Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707 ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2017}}<!--lots of paragraphs without citations-->\n\n[[File:Defoe 1709 The History Of The Union Of Great Britain.JPG|thumb|Title page from Daniel Defoe's: ''The History of the Union of Great Britain'' dated 1709 and printed in Edinburgh by the Heirs of Anderson]]\nIn despair during his imprisonment for the seditious libel case, Defoe wrote to [[William Paterson (banker)|William Paterson]], the London Scot and founder of the [[Bank of England]] and part instigator of the [[Darien scheme]], who was in the confidence of [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]], leading minister and spymaster in the [[Governance of England|English Government]].

Retrieved 31 July 2013.</ref> This so-called \"first draft\" for unification took place 100 years before the signing of the 1707 accord, which respectively preceded the commencement of ''Robinson Crusoe'' by another ten years.\n\nDefoe began his campaign in ''The Review'' and other pamphlets aimed at English opinion, claiming that it would end the threat from the north, gaining for the Treasury an \"inexhaustible treasury of men\", a valuable new market increasing the power of England. By September 1706, Harley ordered Defoe to [[Edinburgh]] as a secret agent to do everything possible to help secure acquiescence in the [[Treaty of Union]]. He was conscious of the risk to himself. Thanks to books such as ''The Letters of Daniel Defoe'' (edited by G. H. Healey, Oxford 1955), far more is known about his activities than is usual with such agents.\n\nHis first reports included vivid descriptions of violent demonstrations against the Union. \"A Scots rabble is the worst of its kind\", he reported. Years later [[Sir John Clerk, 2nd Baronet|John Clerk of Penicuik]], a leading Unionist, wrote in his memoirs that it was not known at the time that Defoe had been sent by Godolphin : {{quote|\u2026 to give a faithful account to him from time to time how everything past here.

It was published in folio. There is not one fact in it which I can challenge\"</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nDefoe was a [[Presbyterian]] who had suffered in England for his convictions, and as such he was accepted as an adviser to the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] and committees of the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. He told Harley that he was \"privy to all their folly\" but \"Perfectly unsuspected as with corresponding with anybody in England\". He was then able to influence the proposals that were put to Parliament and reported,\n\n{{quote|Having had the honour to be always sent for the committee to whom these amendments were referr\u00e8d,<br />I have had the good fortune to break their measures in two particulars via the bounty on Corn and<br />proportion of the Excise.}}\n\nFor Scotland, he used different arguments, even the opposite of those which he used in England, usually ignoring the English doctrine of the [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|Sovereignty of Parliament]], for example, telling the Scots that they could have complete confidence in the guarantees in the Treaty. Some of his pamphlets were purported to be written by Scots, misleading even reputable historians into quoting them as evidence of Scottish opinion of the time. The same is true of a massive history of the Union which Defoe published in 1709 and which some historians still treat as a valuable contemporary source for their own works. Defoe took pains to give his history an air of objectivity by giving some space to arguments against the Union but always having the last word for himself.\n\nHe disposed of the main Union opponent, [[Andrew Fletcher (politician)|Andrew Fletcher]] of [[East Saltoun and West Saltoun|Saltoun]], by ignoring him. Nor does he account for the deviousness of the [[Duke of Hamilton]], the official leader of the various factions opposed to the Union, who seemingly betrayed his former colleagues when he switched to the Unionist/Government side in the decisive final stages of the debate.\n\nDefoe made no attempt to explain why the same Parliament of Scotland which was so vehement for its independence from 1703 to 1705 became so supine in 1706. He received very little reward from his paymasters and of course no recognition for his services by the government. He made use of his Scottish experience to write his ''Tour thro' the whole Island of Great Britain'', published in 1726, where he admitted that the increase of trade and population in Scotland which he had predicted as a consequence of the Union was \"not the case, but rather the contrary\".\n\n[[File:Glasgow Bridge c.1758.JPG|thumb|Glasgow Bridge as Defoe might have seen it in the 18th century]]\nDefoe's description of [[Glasgow]] (Glaschu) as a \"Dear Green Place\" has often been misquoted as a [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] translation for the town's name. The Gaelic ''Glas'' could mean grey or green, while ''chu'' means dog or hollow. ''Glaschu'' probably means \"Green Hollow\". The \"Dear Green Place\", like much of Scotland, was a hotbed of unrest against the Union. The local [[St George's-Tron Church|Tron]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] urged his congregation \"to up and anent for the City of God\".\n\nThe \"Dear Green Place\" and \"City of God\" required government troops to put down the rioters tearing up copies of the Treaty at almost every [[mercat cross]] in Scotland. When Defoe visited in the mid-1720s, he claimed that the hostility towards his party was \"because they were English and because of the Union, which they were almost universally exclaimed against\".{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== Late writing ===\nThe extent and particulars are widely contested concerning Defoe's writing in the period from the Tory fall in 1714 to the publication of ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' in 1719. Defoe comments on the tendency to attribute tracts of uncertain authorship to him in his apologia ''Appeal to Honour and Justice'' (1715), a defence of his part in Harley's Tory ministry (1710\u20131714). Other works that anticipate his novelistic career include ''The Family Instructor'' (1715), a conduct manual on religious duty; ''Minutes of the Negotiations of Monsr. Mesnager'' (1717), in which he impersonates [[Nicolas Mesnager]], the French plenipotentiary who negotiated the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713); and ''A Continuation of the [[Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy]]'' (1718), a satire of European politics and religion, ostensibly written by a [[Muslim]] in Paris.\n\n[[File:Daniel Defoe monument Bunhill Fields.jpg|thumb|upright|Memorial to \"Daniel De-Foe\", [[Bunhill Fields]], [[City Road]], [[Borough of Islington]], London]]\n\nFrom 1719 to 1724, Defoe published the novels for which he is famous (see below). In the final decade of his life, he also wrote conduct manuals, including ''Religious Courtship'' (1722), ''The Complete English Tradesman'' (1726) and ''The New Family Instructor'' (1727). He published a number of books decrying the breakdown of the social order, such as ''The Great Law of Subordination Considered'' (1724) and ''Everybody's Business is Nobody's Business'' (1725) and works on the supernatural, like ''[[The Political History of the Devil]]'' (1726), ''A System of Magick'' (1727) and ''An Essay on the History and Reality of Apparitions'' (1727). His works on foreign travel and trade include ''A General History of Discoveries and Improvements'' (1727) and ''Atlas Maritimus and Commercialis'' (1728). Perhaps his greatest achievement with the novels is the magisterial ''[[A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain]]'' (1724\u20131727), which provided a panoramic survey of British trade on the eve of the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\n====''The Complete English Tradesman''====\n\nPublished in 1726, ''The Complete English Tradesman'' is an example of Defoe's political works. He discusses the role of the tradesman in England in comparison to tradesmen internationally, arguing that the British system of trade is far superior.<ref name=defoe1 /> He also implies that trade is the backbone of the British economy: \"estate's a pond, but trade's a spring.\"<ref name=\"defoe1\">[Defoe, Daniel. The complete English tradesman. London: Tegg, 1841. Print.]</ref> He praises the practicality of trade not only within the economy but the social stratification as well. Most of the British [[gentry]], he argues is at one time or another inextricably linked with the institution of trade, either through personal experience, marriage or genealogy.<ref name=defoe1 /> Oftentimes younger members of noble families entered into trade. Marriage to a tradesman's daughter by a [[nobleman]] was also common. Overall Defoe demonstrated a high respect for '''tradesmen''', being one himself.\n\nNot only does Defoe elevate individual British tradesmen to the level of [[gentleman]], but he praises the entirety of British trade as a superior system.<ref name=defoe1 /> Trade, Defoe argues is a much better catalyst for social and economic change than war. He states that through [[imperialism]] and trade expansion the British empire is able to \"increase commerce at home\" through job creation and increased [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].<ref name= defoe1 /> He states that increased consumption, by laws of supply and demand, increases production and in turn raises wages for the poor therefore lifting part of British society further out of poverty.<ref name=defoe1 />\n\n=== Novels ===\n====''Robinson Crusoe''====\n{{main|Robinson Crusoe}}\nPublished in his late fifties,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Minto |first=William |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924013179902 |title=Daniel Defoe |publisher=Harper & Bros. |year=1879 |location=New York |language=English |oclc=562533988}}</ref> this novel relates the story of a man's shipwreck on a desert island for twenty-eight years and his subsequent adventures.  Throughout its episodic narrative, Crusoe's struggles with faith are apparent as he bargains with God in times of life-threatening crises, but time and again he turns his back after his deliverances. He is finally content with his lot in life, separated from society, following a more genuine conversion experience.\n\nIn the opening pages of ''[[The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe]]'', the author describes how Crusoe settled in [[Bedfordshire]], married and produced a family, and that when his wife died, he went off on these further adventures.  Bedford is also the place where the brother of \"H. F.\" in ''[[A Journal of the Plague Year]]'' retired to avoid the danger of the plague, so that by implication, if these works were not fiction, Defoe's family met Crusoe in Bedford, from whence the information in these books was gathered.  Defoe went to school in Stoke Newington, London, with a friend named Caruso.\n\nThe novel has been assumed to be based in part on the story of the Scottish castaway [[Alexander Selkirk]], who spent four years stranded in the [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]],<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\" /> but this experience is inconsistent with the details of the narrative.  The island Selkirk lived on was named M\u00e1s a Tierra (Closer to Land) at the time and was renamed [[Robinson Crusoe Island]] in 1966. It has been supposed that Defoe may have also been inspired by the Latin or English translation of a book by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]]-Arab Muslim polymath [[Ibn Tufail]], who was known as \"Abubacer\" in Europe. The Latin edition of the book was entitled ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Philosophus Autodidactus]]'' and it was an earlier novel that is also set on a deserted island.<ref>Nawal Muhammad Hassan (1980), ''Hayy bin Yaqzan and Robinson Crusoe: A study of an early Arabic impact on English literature'', Al-Rashid House for Publication.</ref><ref>Cyril Glass\u00e9 (2001), ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', Rowman Altamira, p. 202, {{ISBN|0-7591-0190-6}}.</ref><ref name=\"Amber\">{{Cite journal |last=Amber Haque |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357\u2013377 [369] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z |jstor=27512819}}</ref><ref name=\"Wainwright\">Martin Wainwright (22 March 2003) [http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,918454,00.html Desert island scripts], ''[[The Guardian]]''.</ref>\n[[File:Daniel Defoe former house England.jpg|thumb|A house where Defoe once lived, near London, England]]\n\n====''Captain Singleton''====\n\nDefoe's next novel was ''[[Captain Singleton]]'' (1720), an adventure story whose first half covers a traversal of Africa which anticipated subsequent discoveries by [[David Livingstone]] and whose second half taps into the contemporary fascination with [[piracy]]. The novel has been commended for its sensitive depiction of the close relationship between the hero and his religious mentor, [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] William Walters.

The ceaseless chant of doom echoed through a city of emptied streets and filled grave pits. For this was London in the year of 1665, the Year of the Great Plague&nbsp;\u2026 In 1721, when the Black Death again threatened the European Continent, Daniel Defoe wrote \"[[A Journal of the Plague Year]]\" to alert an indifferent populace to the horror that was almost upon them. Through the eyes of a saddler who had chosen to remain while multitudes fled, the master realist vividly depicted a plague-stricken city. He re-enacted the terror of a helpless people caught in a tragedy they could not comprehend: the weak preying on the dying, the strong administering to the sick, the sinful orgies of the cynical, the quiet faith of the pious. With dramatic insight, he captured for all time the death throes of a great city.<p>\u2014 Back cover of the New American Library version of \"A Journal of the Plague Year\"; Signet Classic, 1960</blockquote>\n\n==== ''Colonel Jack'' ====\n\n'''''[[Colonel Jack]]''''' (1722) follows an orphaned boy from a life of poverty and crime to colonial prosperity, military and marital imbroglios, and religious conversion, driven by a problematic notion of becoming a \"gentleman.\"\n\n==== ''Moll Flanders'' ====\nAlso in 1722, Defoe wrote '''''[[Moll Flanders]]''''', another first-person [[picaresque novel]] of the fall and eventual redemption, both material and spiritual, of a lone woman in 17th-century England. The titular heroine appears as a whore, bigamist, and thief, lives in [[Liberty of the Mint|The Mint]], commits adultery and incest, and yet manages to retain the reader's sympathy. Her savvy manipulation of both men and wealth earns her a life of trials but ultimately an ending in reward. Although Moll struggles with the morality of some of her actions and decisions, religion seems to be far from her concerns throughout most of her story. However, like Robinson Crusoe, she finally repents. ''Moll Flanders'' is an important work in the development of the novel, as it challenged the common perception of femininity and gender roles in 18th-century British society.<ref name=\"Novak 2001\" /> More recently it has come to be misunderstood as an example of [[erotica]].<ref name=\"historyextra\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/moll-the-life-and-times-of-moll-flanders/ |title=Moll: The Life and Times of Moll Flanders |website=History Extra |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190428084347/https://www.historyextra.com/period/moll-the-life-and-times-of-moll-flanders/ |archive-date=28 April 2019 |access-date=30 May 2018}}</ref><ref>Ann Louise Kibbie,  \"Monstrous generation: the birth of capital in Defoe's Moll Flanders and Roxana.\" ''PMLA''  (1995) 110#5: 1023-1034 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/463027 online].</ref>\n\n==== ''Roxana'' ====\n\n''Moll Flanders'' and Defoe's final novel, '''''[[Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress]]''''' (1724), are examples of the remarkable way in which Defoe seems to inhabit his fictional characters (yet \"drawn from life\"), not least in that they are women. ''Roxana'' narrates the moral and spiritual decline of a high society courtesan. ''Roxana'' differs from other Defoe works because the main character does not exhibit a conversion experience, even though she claims to be a penitent later in her life, at the time that she is relaying her story.\n\n== Death ==\n[[File:Bunhill Fields, London 13.JPG|thumb|[[Bunhill Fields]] monument detail]]\nDaniel Defoe died on 24 April 1731, probably while in hiding from his creditors.

This term is found in the [[New Testament]] only in the [[Canonical Gospels|Gospels]] and [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]. In the ancient world a disciple is a follower or adherent of a teacher. It is not the same as being a student in the modern sense. A disciple in the ancient biblical world actively imitated both the life and teaching of the master.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=K\u00f6stenberger|first=Andreas J.|date=1998|title=Jesus as Rabbi in the Fourth Gospel|url=https://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/bbr/rabbi_kostenberger.pdf|journal=Bulletin for Biblical Research|volume=8|pages=97\u2013128|via=}}</ref> It was a deliberate apprenticeship which made the fully formed disciple a living copy of the master.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Sri|first=Edward|date=2018|title=In the Dust of the Rabbi: Clarifying Discipleship for Faith Formation Today|url=https://review.catechetics.com/dust-rabbi-clarifying-discipleship-faith-formation-today|journal=The Catechetical Review|volume=Issue #4.2|pages=online edition|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe New Testament records many followers of Jesus during [[Ministry of Jesus|his ministry]]. Some disciples were given a [[Christian mission|mission]], such as the [[Matthew 10|Little Commission]], the [[Seventy disciples|commission of the seventy]] in Luke's Gospel, the [[Great Commission]] after the [[Post-resurrection appearances of Jesus|resurrection of Jesus]], or the [[Conversion of Paul the Apostle|conversion of Paul]], making them ''[[apostles]]'', charged with proclaiming [[the gospel]] (the Good News) to the world. Jesus emphasised that being his disciples would be costly.\n\n==Background of the term==\nThe term \"disciple\" represents the [[Koine Greek]] word {{grc-tr|\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2}} ({{lang|grc|\u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2}}),<ref>{{cite web   \n| url = http://www.htmlbible.com/sacrednamebiblecom/kjvstrongs/STRGRK31.htm#S3101\n| title = \u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2}}</ref> which generally means \"one who engages in learning through instruction from another, ''pupil, apprentice\"'' <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature (3rd ed)|last=Danker|first=Arndt, W., W., Bauer, W., & Gingrich, F.

More specifically \"messengers with extraordinary status, especially of God\u2019s ''messenger, envoy\"''<ref>''A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature''., p. 122.</ref>  but predominately in the New Testament it is used of ''\"a group of highly honored [[Christians|believers]] with a special function as God\u2019s envoys\"''<ref>''Ibid.''</ref><ref name=\"Christianity.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.christianity.com/11536381/|title=Christian History: The Twelve Apostles|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref> While a disciple is one who learns and apprentices under a teacher or [[rabbi]], an apostle is one sent as a missionary to proclaim the good news and to establish new communities of believers.\n\nThe meaning of the word 'disciple' is not derived primarily from its root meaning or etymology but from its widespread usage in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]]. Disciples are found in the world outside of the Bible. For example among the ancient [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]], disciples learned by imitating the teacher\u2019s entire way of life and not just by remembering the spoken words of the teacher.\n\nThe first-century philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] appeals to the \"living voice and intimacy of common life\" of the disciple{{endash}}teacher relationship of many different philosophers:\n\n{{blockquote|[[Cleanthes]] could not have been the express image of [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]], if he had merely heard his lectures; he also shared in his life, saw into his hidden purposes, and watched him to see whether he lived according to his own rules.

A disciple is first a believer who has exercised faith (Acts 2:38).<ref>[[Born again#Catholicism]]</ref> This means they have experienced conversion and put Jesus at the center of their life and participated in rites of Christian imitation. A fully developed disciple is also a leader of others who attempts to pass on this faith to his followers, with the goal of repeating this process.(1 Corinthians 4:16-17; 2 Timothy 2:2). A special form of passing on leadership through discipleship is called [[apostolic succession]].\n\n==Great crowd and the seventy==\n{{Main|Seventy disciples}}\nIn addition to the [[Twelve Apostles]] there is a much larger group of people identified as disciples in the opening of the passage of the [[Sermon on the Plain]]. {{bibleref2c|Luke|6:17}} In addition, seventy (or seventy-two, depending on the source used) people are sent out in pairs to prepare the way for Jesus (Luke 10). They are sometimes referred to as the \"Seventy\" or the \"[[Seventy Disciples]]\". They are to eat any food offered, heal the sick and spread the word that the [[Kingdom of God]] is coming.\n\n==Undesirables==\nJesus practiced open table fellowship, scandalizing his critics by dining with sinners, tax collectors, and women.\n\n===Sinners and tax collectors===\nThe gospels use the term \"sinners and tax collectors\" to depict those he fraternized with. [[Sinners]] were Jews who violated [[Tumah|purity rules]], or generally any of the [[613 mitzvot]], or possibly Gentiles who violated [[Noahide Law]], though [[halacha]] was still in dispute in the 1st century, see also [[Hillel and Shammai]] and [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity]]. Tax collectors profited from the Roman economic system that the Romans imposed in [[Iudaea province]], which was displacing Galileans in their own homeland, foreclosing on family land and selling it to absentee landlords. In the honor-based culture of the time, such behavior went against the social grain.\n\n===Samaritans===\n{{Main|Samaritans}}\nSamaritans, positioned between Jesus' Galilee and Jerusalem's Judea, were mutually hostile with Jews. In Luke and John, Jesus extends his ministry to Samaritans.\n\n===Women who followed Jesus===\nIn Luke (10:38\u201342), [[Mary, sister of Lazarus]], is contrasted with her sister [[Martha]], who was \"cumbered about many things\" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen \"the better part,\" that of listening to the master's discourse.  John names her as the \"one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and dried his feet with her hair\" (11:2).  In Luke, an unidentified \"sinner\" in the house of a Pharisee anoints Jesus' feet.  \nLuke refers to a number of people accompanying Jesus and the twelve.  From among them he names three women: \"[[Mary Magdalene|Mary, called Magdalene]], ... and [[Saint Joanna|Joanna]] the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, and [[Susanna (disciple)|Susanna]], and many others, who provided for them out of their resources\" (Luke 8:2-3).  Mary Magdalene and Joanna are among the women who went to prepare Jesus' body in Luke's account of the resurrection, and who later told the apostles and other disciples about the empty tomb and words of the \"two men in dazzling clothes\".  Mary Magdalene is the most well-known of the disciples outside of the Twelve.  More is written in the gospels about her than the other female followers.  There is also a large body of lore and literature covering her.\n\nOther gospel writers differ as to which women witness the [[crucifixion]] and witness to the [[resurrection]].  Mark includes [[Mary Jacobe|Mary, the mother of James]] and [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]] (not to be confused with [[Salome|Salom\u00e9]] the daughter of Herodias) at the crucifixion and Salome at the tomb.  John includes [[Mary, the wife of Cleopas|Mary the wife of Clopas]] at the crucifixion.\n\n===Cleopas and companion on the road to Emmaus===\n{{See also|Resurrection appearances of Jesus}}\nIn Luke, [[Cleopas]] is one of the two disciples to whom the [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|risen Lord]] appears at [[Emmaus]] (Luke 24:18). Cleopas, with an unnamed disciple of Jesus' are walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus on the day of Jesus' resurrection. Cleopas and his friend were discussing the events of the past few days when a stranger asked them what they spoke of.  The stranger is asked to join Cleopas and his friend for the evening meal.  There the stranger is  revealed, in blessing and breaking the bread, as the resurrected Jesus before he disappears. Cleopas and his friend hastened to Jerusalem to carry the news to the other disciples, to discover that Jesus had appeared there also and would do so again. The incident is without parallel in Matthew, Mark, or John.\n\n==Discipleship==\n\n===\"Love one another\"===\n{{Main|New Commandment}}\nA definition of disciple is suggested by Jesus' self-referential example from the [[Gospel of John]] 13:34-35: \"I give you a [[The New Commandment|new commandment]], that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.\" (NRSV)   Further definition by Jesus can be found in the [[Gospel of Luke]], Chapter 14.  Beginning with a testing trap laid out by his adversaries regarding observance of the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]], Jesus uses the opportunity to lay out the problems with the religiosity of his adversaries against [[Ministry of Jesus|his own teaching]] by giving a litany of shocking comparisons between various, apparent socio-political and socio-economic realities versus the meaning of being his disciple.\n\n===\"Be transformed\"===\n\n\"Discipleship\" and \"following Christ\" are used synonymously. The [[Gospel#Canonical gospels|canonical Gospels]], [[Acts]], and [[Pauline epistles|Epistles]] urge disciples to be imitators of Jesus Christ or of God himself. Being imitators requires obedience exemplified by moral behavior.<ref>Richard N. Longenecker, ed., ''Patterns of Discipleship in the New Testament'' (Eerdman\u2019s, 1996) 1, 5, 141.</ref> With this [[Bible|biblical]] basis, [[Christian theology]] teaches that discipleship entails transformation from some other ''[[World view]]'' and practice of life into that of Jesus Christ, and so, by way of [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] theology, of God himself.<ref>\"[[Rick Warren]]\u2019s Definition of Disciple\" at {{cite web|url=http://blog.exponential.org/2012/11/warren-on-discipleship/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001244/http://blog.exponential.org/2012/11/warren-on-discipleship/ |archivedate=2013-12-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Apostle Paul]] stressed transformation as a prerequisite for discipleship when he wrote that disciples must \"not be conformed to this world\" but must \"be transformed by the renewing of [their] minds\" so that they \"may discern what is the will of God\u2014what is good and acceptable and perfect.\" (Romans 12:2 [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]]) Therefore, a disciple is not simply an accumulator of information or one who merely changes moral behavior in conformity with the teachings of Jesus Christ, but seeks a [[Metanoia (theology)#Metanoia today|fundamental shift]] toward the ethics of Jesus Christ in every way, including complete devotion to God.<ref>''Tyndale Bible Dictionary'' (Tyndale House, 2001),  s.v. \"Disciple.\"</ref>\n\nIn several Christian traditions, the process of becoming a disciple is called the ''[[Imitation of Christ]].''

More specifically \"messengers with extraordinary status, especially of God\u2019s ''messenger, envoy\"''<ref>''A Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian literature''., p. 122.</ref>  but predominately in the New Testament it is used of ''\"a group of highly honored [[Christians|believers]] with a special function as God\u2019s envoys\"''<ref>''Ibid.''</ref><ref name=\"Christianity.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.christianity.com/11536381/|title=Christian History: The Twelve Apostles|accessdate=2007-11-19}}</ref> While a disciple is one who learns and apprentices under a teacher or [[rabbi]], an apostle is one sent as a missionary to proclaim the good news and to establish new communities of believers.\n\nThe meaning of the word 'disciple' is not derived primarily from its root meaning or etymology but from its widespread usage in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]]. Disciples are found in the world outside of the Bible. For example among the ancient [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]], disciples learned by imitating the teacher\u2019s entire way of life and not just by remembering the spoken words of the teacher.\n\nThe first-century philosopher [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] appeals to the \"living voice and intimacy of common life\" of the disciple{{endash}}teacher relationship of many different philosophers:\n\n{{blockquote|[[Cleanthes]] could not have been the express image of [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]], if he had merely heard his lectures; he also shared in his life, saw into his hidden purposes, and watched him to see whether he lived according to his own rules.

A disciple is first a believer who has exercised faith (Acts 2:38).<ref>[[Born again#Catholicism]]</ref> This means they have experienced conversion and put Jesus at the center of their life and participated in rites of Christian imitation. A fully developed disciple is also a leader of others who attempts to pass on this faith to his followers, with the goal of repeating this process.(1 Corinthians 4:16-17; 2 Timothy 2:2). A special form of passing on leadership through discipleship is called [[apostolic succession]].\n\n==Great crowd and the seventy==\n{{Main|Seventy disciples}}\nIn addition to the [[Twelve Apostles]] there is a much larger group of people identified as disciples in the opening of the passage of the [[Sermon on the Plain]]. {{bibleref2c|Luke|6:17}} In addition, seventy (or seventy-two, depending on the source used) people are sent out in pairs to prepare the way for Jesus (Luke 10). They are sometimes referred to as the \"Seventy\" or the \"[[Seventy Disciples]]\". They are to eat any food offered, heal the sick and spread the word that the [[Kingdom of God]] is coming.\n\n==Undesirables==\nJesus practiced open table fellowship, scandalizing his critics by dining with sinners, tax collectors, and women.\n\n===Sinners and tax collectors===\nThe gospels use the term \"sinners and tax collectors\" to depict those he fraternized with. [[Sinners]] were Jews who violated [[Tumah|purity rules]], or generally any of the [[613 mitzvot]], or possibly Gentiles who violated [[Noahide Law]], though [[halacha]] was still in dispute in the 1st century, see also [[Hillel and Shammai]] and [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity]]. Tax collectors profited from the Roman economic system that the Romans imposed in [[Iudaea province]], which was displacing Galileans in their own homeland, foreclosing on family land and selling it to absentee landlords. In the honor-based culture of the time, such behavior went against the social grain.\n\n===Samaritans===\n{{Main|Samaritans}}\nSamaritans, positioned between Jesus' Galilee and Jerusalem's Judea, were mutually hostile with Jews. In Luke and John, Jesus extends his ministry to Samaritans.\n\n===Women who followed Jesus===\nIn Luke (10:38\u201342), [[Mary, sister of Lazarus]], is contrasted with her sister [[Martha]], who was \"cumbered about many things\" while Jesus was their guest, while Mary had chosen \"the better part,\" that of listening to the master's discourse.  John names her as the \"one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and dried his feet with her hair\" (11:2).  In Luke, an unidentified \"sinner\" in the house of a Pharisee anoints Jesus' feet.  \nLuke refers to a number of people accompanying Jesus and the twelve.  From among them he names three women: \"[[Mary Magdalene|Mary, called Magdalene]], ... and [[Saint Joanna|Joanna]] the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, and [[Susanna (disciple)|Susanna]], and many others, who provided for them out of their resources\" (Luke 8:2-3).  Mary Magdalene and Joanna are among the women who went to prepare Jesus' body in Luke's account of the resurrection, and who later told the apostles and other disciples about the empty tomb and words of the \"two men in dazzling clothes\".  Mary Magdalene is the most well-known of the disciples outside of the Twelve.  More is written in the gospels about her than the other female followers.  There is also a large body of lore and literature covering her.\n\nOther gospel writers differ as to which women witness the [[crucifixion]] and witness to the [[resurrection]].  Mark includes [[Mary Jacobe|Mary, the mother of James]] and [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]] (not to be confused with [[Salome|Salom\u00e9]] the daughter of Herodias) at the crucifixion and Salome at the tomb.  John includes [[Mary, the wife of Cleopas|Mary the wife of Clopas]] at the crucifixion.\n\n===Cleopas and companion on the road to Emmaus===\n{{See also|Resurrection appearances of Jesus}}\nIn Luke, [[Cleopas]] is one of the two disciples to whom the [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus|risen Lord]] appears at [[Emmaus]] (Luke 24:18). Cleopas, with an unnamed disciple of Jesus' are walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus on the day of Jesus' resurrection. Cleopas and his friend were discussing the events of the past few days when a stranger asked them what they spoke of.  The stranger is asked to join Cleopas and his friend for the evening meal.  There the stranger is  revealed, in blessing and breaking the bread, as the resurrected Jesus before he disappears. Cleopas and his friend hastened to Jerusalem to carry the news to the other disciples, to discover that Jesus had appeared there also and would do so again. The incident is without parallel in Matthew, Mark, or John.\n\n==Discipleship==\n\n===\"Love one another\"===\n{{Main|New Commandment}}\nA definition of disciple is suggested by Jesus' self-referential example from the [[Gospel of John]] 13:34-35: \"I give you a [[The New Commandment|new commandment]], that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.\" (NRSV)   Further definition by Jesus can be found in the [[Gospel of Luke]], Chapter 14.  Beginning with a testing trap laid out by his adversaries regarding observance of the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]], Jesus uses the opportunity to lay out the problems with the religiosity of his adversaries against [[Ministry of Jesus|his own teaching]] by giving a litany of shocking comparisons between various, apparent socio-political and socio-economic realities versus the meaning of being his disciple.\n\n===\"Be transformed\"===\n\n\"Discipleship\" and \"following Christ\" are used synonymously. The [[Gospel#Canonical gospels|canonical Gospels]], [[Acts]], and [[Pauline epistles|Epistles]] urge disciples to be imitators of Jesus Christ or of God himself. Being imitators requires obedience exemplified by moral behavior.<ref>Richard N. Longenecker, ed., ''Patterns of Discipleship in the New Testament'' (Eerdman\u2019s, 1996) 1, 5, 141.</ref> With this [[Bible|biblical]] basis, [[Christian theology]] teaches that discipleship entails transformation from some other ''[[World view]]'' and practice of life into that of Jesus Christ, and so, by way of [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] theology, of God himself.<ref>\"[[Rick Warren]]\u2019s Definition of Disciple\" at {{cite web|url=http://blog.exponential.org/2012/11/warren-on-discipleship/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001244/http://blog.exponential.org/2012/11/warren-on-discipleship/ |archivedate=2013-12-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Apostle Paul]] stressed transformation as a prerequisite for discipleship when he wrote that disciples must \"not be conformed to this world\" but must \"be transformed by the renewing of [their] minds\" so that they \"may discern what is the will of God\u2014what is good and acceptable and perfect.\" (Romans 12:2 [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]]) Therefore, a disciple is not simply an accumulator of information or one who merely changes moral behavior in conformity with the teachings of Jesus Christ, but seeks a [[Metanoia (theology)#Metanoia today|fundamental shift]] toward the ethics of Jesus Christ in every way, including complete devotion to God.<ref>''Tyndale Bible Dictionary'' (Tyndale House, 2001),  s.v. \"Disciple.\"</ref>\n\nIn several Christian traditions, the process of becoming a disciple is called the ''[[Imitation of Christ]].'' This concept goes back to the [[Pauline Epistles]]: \"be imitators of God\" (Ephesians 5:1) and \"be imitators of me, as I am of Christ\"(1 Corinthians 11:1).<ref name=Bowden285 >''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology'' by Alan Richardson, John Bowden 1983 {{ISBN|978-0-664-22748-7}} s.v. \"Imitation of Christ, The,\" 285-286.</ref> ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' by [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]] promoted this concept in the 14th century.\n\n===The Great Commission===\n{{Main|Great Commission}}\nUbiquitous throughout Christianity is the practice of [[proselytization]], making new disciples.
