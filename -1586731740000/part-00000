Fought near [[Covadonga]], in the [[Picos de Europa]] Mountains, either in 718 or 722,<ref name=\"Remensnyder23\" /> it reportedly resulted in a victory for the Christian forces led by [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]]. The Christian victory, whose actual existence has been disputed, was supposed to be central to the consolidation of an independent Christian polity (controlled by either Visigothic elites, local elites, or an alliance between the former two) that grew into the [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. As a result, the Battle of Covadonga has been metahistorically reconstructed as the initial point of the \"''{{lang|es|[[Reconquista]]}}''\" (\"reconquest\") of Christian rule to the entire peninsula,<ref>Ring, Trudy, Robert M. Salkin and Sharon La Boda, ''International Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe'', (Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1995), 170.</ref> after the [[Islamic conquest of Hispania]] in 711\u2013718.\n\n==Prelude==\nAccording to texts written by [[Mozarabs]] in northern Iberia during the late ninth century, the [[Visigoths]] in AD 718 elected a nobleman named [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]], (681\u2013737) as their ''princeps'', or leader. Pelagius (''Don Pelayo'' in Spanish), the first monarch of the Asturian Kingdom, was a grandson of a former king of [[Hispania]], [[Chindasuinth]], and son of Favila, who had been a dignitary at the court of the Visigoth King [[Egica]] (687\u2013700), established his headquarters at [[Cangas de On\u00eds]], [[Asturias]] and incited an uprising against the [[Umayyad]] Muslims.\n\nFrom the beginning of the Muslim invasion of Iberia, refugees and combatants visigoths from the south of the peninsula had been moving north to avoid Islamic authority. Some had taken refuge in the remote mountains of [[Asturias]] in the northwestern part of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. There, from among the dispossessed of the south, Pelagius recruited his band of fighters and also achieved the collaboration of [[Astures|the Astures]] or Astyrs that populated those mountains . His first acts were to refuse to pay the [[Jizya]] (tax on non-Muslims) to the Muslims any longer and to assault the small Umayyad garrisons that had been stationed in the area. Eventually, he managed to expel a provincial governor named [[Munuza]] from [[Asturias]]. He held the territory against a number of attempts to re-establish Muslim control, and soon founded the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], which became a Christian stronghold against further Muslim expansion.\n\nFor the first few years, this rebellion posed no threat to the new masters of Hispania, whose seat of power had been established at [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. Consequently, there was only a minor perfunctory reaction. Pelagius was not always able to keep the Muslims out of Asturias but neither could they defeat him, and as soon as the Moors left, he would always re-establish control. Islamic forces were focused on raiding [[Narbonne]] and [[Gaul]], and there was a shortage of manpower for putting down an inconsequential insurrection in the mountains. Pelagius never attempted to force the issue, and it was an Umayyad defeat elsewhere that probably set the stage for the Battle of Covadonga. On July 9, 721, a Muslim force that had crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and invaded the Kingdom of the [[Franks]] was defeated by them in the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]], in present-day France. This was the first serious setback in the Muslim campaign in southwestern Europe. Reluctant to return to C\u00f3rdoba with such unalloyed bad news, the [[Ummayad]] [[w\u0101li]], [[Anbasa ibn Suhaym Al-Kalbi]], decided that putting down the rebellion in Asturias on his way home would afford his troops an easy victory and raise their flagging morale.\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:The Battle of Covadonga.jpg|thumb|King Pelayo at the Battle of Covadonga]]\nIn 722, forces commanded by the Umayyad commanders [[Al Qama]] and [[Munuza]], and (according to legend) accompanied by Bishop [[Oppas]]<ref>Archer, Thomas Andrew and Charles Lethbridge Kingsford, ''The Story of the Crusades'', (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1895), 25.</ref> of Seville, were sent to Asturias. As Al Qama overran much of the region, folklore<ref>\"Spain: The Northern Kingdoms and the Basques, by Roger Collins.\" The New Cambridge Medieval History. Ed. Rosamond McKitterick. Vol. II. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1995. Print.</ref> suggests that Oppas attempted to broker the surrender of his fellow Christians, but he failed in the effort.

Fought near [[Covadonga]], in the [[Picos de Europa]] Mountains, either in 718 or 722,<ref name=\"Remensnyder23\" /> it reportedly resulted in a victory for the Christian forces led by [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]]. The Christian victory, whose actual existence has been disputed, was supposed to be central to the consolidation of an independent Christian polity (controlled by either Visigothic elites, local elites, or an alliance between the former two) that grew into the [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. As a result, the Battle of Covadonga has been metahistorically reconstructed as the initial point of the \"''{{lang|es|[[Reconquista]]}}''\" (\"reconquest\") of Christian rule to the entire peninsula,<ref>Ring, Trudy, Robert M. Salkin and Sharon La Boda, ''International Dictionary of Historic Places: Southern Europe'', (Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, 1995), 170.</ref> after the [[Islamic conquest of Hispania]] in 711\u2013718.\n\n==Prelude==\nAccording to texts written by [[Mozarabs]] in northern Iberia during the late ninth century, the [[Visigoths]] in AD 718 elected a nobleman named [[Pelagius of Asturias|Pelagius]], (681\u2013737) as their ''princeps'', or leader. Pelagius (''Don Pelayo'' in Spanish), the first monarch of the Asturian Kingdom, was a grandson of a former king of [[Hispania]], [[Chindasuinth]], and son of Favila, who had been a dignitary at the court of the Visigoth King [[Egica]] (687\u2013700), established his headquarters at [[Cangas de On\u00eds]], [[Asturias]] and incited an uprising against the [[Umayyad]] Muslims.\n\nFrom the beginning of the Muslim invasion of Iberia, refugees and combatants from the south of the peninsula had been moving north to avoid Islamic authority. Some had taken refuge in the remote mountains of [[Asturias]] in the northwestern part of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. There, from among the dispossessed of the south, Pelagius recruited his band of fighters. His first acts were to refuse to pay the [[Jizya]] (tax on non-Muslims) to the Muslims any longer and to assault the small Umayyad garrisons that had been stationed in the area. Eventually, he managed to expel a provincial governor named [[Munuza]] from [[Asturias]]. He held the territory against a number of attempts to re-establish Muslim control, and soon founded the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], which became a Christian stronghold against further Muslim expansion.\n\nFor the first few years, this rebellion posed no threat to the new masters of Hispania, whose seat of power had been established at [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. Consequently, there was only a minor perfunctory reaction. Pelagius was not always able to keep the Muslims out of Asturias but neither could they defeat him, and as soon as the Moors left, he would always re-establish control. Islamic forces were focused on raiding [[Narbonne]] and [[Gaul]], and there was a shortage of manpower for putting down an inconsequential insurrection in the mountains. Pelagius never attempted to force the issue, and it was an Umayyad defeat elsewhere that probably set the stage for the Battle of Covadonga. On July 9, 721, a Muslim force that had crossed the [[Pyrenees]] and invaded the Kingdom of the [[Franks]] was defeated by them in the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]], in present-day France. This was the first serious setback in the Muslim campaign in southwestern Europe. Reluctant to return to C\u00f3rdoba with such unalloyed bad news, the [[Ummayad]] [[w\u0101li]], [[Anbasa ibn Suhaym Al-Kalbi]], decided that putting down the rebellion in Asturias on his way home would afford his troops an easy victory and raise their flagging morale.\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:The Battle of Covadonga.jpg|thumb|King Pelayo at the Battle of Covadonga]]\nIn 722, forces commanded by the Umayyad commanders [[Al Qama]] and [[Munuza]], and (according to legend) accompanied by Bishop [[Oppas]]<ref>Archer, Thomas Andrew and Charles Lethbridge Kingsford, ''The Story of the Crusades'', (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1895), 25.</ref> of Seville, were sent to Asturias. As Al Qama overran much of the region, folklore<ref>\"Spain: The Northern Kingdoms and the Basques, by Roger Collins.\" The New Cambridge Medieval History. Ed. Rosamond McKitterick. Vol. II. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1995. Print.</ref> suggests that Oppas attempted to broker the surrender of his fellow Christians, but he failed in the effort. Pelagius and his force retreated deep into the mountains of Asturias, eventually retiring into a narrow valley flanked by mountains, which was easily defensible due to the impossibility of launching a broad-fronted attack. Pelagius may have had as few as three hundred men with him.\n\nAl Qama eventually arrived at Covadonga, and sent forward an envoy to convince Pelagius to surrender. He refused, so Al Qama ordered his best troops into the valley to fight. The Asturians shot arrows and stones from the slopes of the mountains, and then, at the climactic moment, Pelagius personally led some of his soldiers out into the valley. They had been hiding in a cave, unseen by the Muslims. The Christian accounts of the battle claim that the slaughter among the Muslims was horrific, while Umayyad accounts describe it as a mere skirmish. Al Qama himself fell in the battle, and his soldiers withdrew from the battlefield.\n\nIn the aftermath of Pelagius' victory, the people of the conquered villages of Asturias now emerged with their weapons, and killed hundreds of Al Qama's retreating troops. Munuza, learning of the defeat, organized another force, and gathered what was left of the survivors of Covadonga. At some later date, he confronted Pelagius and his now greatly augmented force, near the modern town of [[Proaza]]. Again Pelagius won, and Munuza was killed in the fighting. The battle is commemorated at the shrine of [[Our Lady of Covadonga]].\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Christianity|War}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Covadonga 722}}\n[[Category:720s conflicts]]\n[[Category:722]]\n[[Category:Battles involving the Kingdom of Asturias|Covadonga]]\n[[Category:Battles involving the Umayyad Caliphate]]\n[[Category:Battles of the Reconquista]]\n[[Category:8th century in Al-Andalus]]\n[[Category:Pelagius of Asturias]]\n", "name_user": "REKKWINT", "label": "safe", "comment": "added information.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Covadonga"}

In 1955, the museum moved to its current location on Union Avenue near [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga race course]], at which time inductions into the hall of fame began. Each spring, following the tabulation of the final votes, the announcement of new inductees is made, usually during [[Kentucky Derby]] Week in early May. The actual inductions are held in mid-August during the [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga]] race meeting.\n\nThe Hall of Fame's nominating committee selects eight to ten candidates from among the four Contemporary categories (male horse, female horse, jockey and trainer) to be presented to the voters. Changes in voting procedures that commenced with the 2010 candidates allow the voters to choose multiple candidates from a single Contemporary category, instead of a single candidate from each of the four Contemporary categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/horse/news/story?id=4962597|title=Racing Hall of Fame changes voting procedures|date=3 March 2010|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> For example, in 2016, two female horses (Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta) were inducted at the same time.\n\nThe museum also houses a large collection of art, artifacts, and memorabilia that document the history of horse racing from the eighteenth century to the present.\n\n==History==\nThe museum first opened its doors in 1951, at which time it occupied a single room in Saratoga's [[Canfield Casino]]. The establishment was supported by the city of [[Saratoga Springs]], which donated $2,500, the Saratoga Racing Association, which donated $5,000, and various patrons of the sport, who also donated various pieces of art and memorabilia. The first item in the museum's collection was a horseshoe worn by the great [[Lexington (horse)|Lexington]].<ref name=\"EvolvedPt1\">{{cite web |last1=Goode |first1=Kristen Ingwell |title=Racing's Hall of Fame Evolved From Humble Beginnings |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192192/racings-hall-of-fame-evolved-from-humble-beginnings |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the museum relocated to its current location on Union Avenue, close to the main entrance of [[Saratoga Race Course]]. Inductions into the hall of fame began at the same time. Since then, the museum has expanded several times to allow for the display of its extensive art collection and more multimedia displays on the history of the sport.<ref name=EvolvedPt1 />\n\n==Horses in the Hall of Fame==\n[[File:HorseracingHallofFame.jpg|thumb|The Hall of Fame gallery at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga]]\nIn the early years, inductions to the hall of fame were based on the evaluation of a panel of racing historians. In 1955, a group of 9 horses from the earliest years of the American turf were inducted.<ref name=\"EvolvedPt2\">{{cite web |title=Hall of Fame: Humble Beginnings (Cont.) |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192191/hall-of-fame-humble-beginnings-cont |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> The 1956 class included 11 horses that raced around the turn of the century, while the 1957 class included 10 horses that raced up to the mid-thirties. Since then, the classes have been significantly smaller as the inductions shifted to more contemporary horses. Under current rules, a horse must have been retired for a minimum of five full calendar years to be eligible for the hall of fame. Thoroughbreds remain eligible in the contemporary category between five and 25 calendar years following their final racing year. Thoroughbreds retired for more than 25 calendar years may become eligible through the Historic Review Committee.<ref name=EvolvedPt1 /><ref name=Eligibility>{{cite web|title=Eligibility, Nomination and Election - National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|url=https://www.racingmuseum.org/eligibility-nomination-and-election|website=www.racingmuseum.org|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n!Photo!!Name!!Inducted!!Career Years!!Starts!!Wins\n|-\n| [[File:1992APIndy (2).jpg|100px]]||[[A.P.

In 1955, the museum moved to its current location on Union Avenue near [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga race course]], at which time inductions into the hall of fame began. Each spring, following the tabulation of the final votes, the announcement of new inductees is made, usually during [[Kentucky Derby]] Week in early May. The actual inductions are held in mid-August during the [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga]] race meeting.\n\nThe Hall of Fame's nominating committee selects eight to ten candidates from among the four Contemporary categories (male horse, female horse, jockey and trainer) to be presented to the voters. Changes in voting procedures that commenced with the 2010 candidates allow the voters to choose multiple candidates from a single Contemporary category, instead of a single candidate from each of the four Contemporary categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/horse/news/story?id=4962597|title=Racing Hall of Fame changes voting procedures|date=3 March 2010|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> For example, in 2016, two female horses (Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta) were inducted at the same time.\n\nThe museum also houses a large collection of art, artifacts, and memorabilia that document the history of horse racing from the eighteenth century to the present.\n\n==History==\nThe museum first opened its doors in 1951, at which time it occupied a single room in Saratoga's [[Canfield Casino]]. The establishment was supported by the city of [[Saratoga Springs]], which donated $2,500, the Saratoga Racing Association, which donated $5,000, and various patrons of the sport, who also donated various pieces of art and memorabilia. The first item in the museum's collection was a horseshoe worn by the great [[Lexington (horse)|Lexington]].<ref name=\"EvolvedPt1\">{{cite web |last1=Goode |first1=Kristen Ingwell |title=Racing's Hall of Fame Evolved From Humble Beginnings |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192192/racings-hall-of-fame-evolved-from-humble-beginnings |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the museum relocated to its current location on Union Avenue, close to the main entrance of [[Saratoga Race Course]]. Inductions into the hall of fame began at the same time. Since then, the museum has expanded several times to allow for the display of its extensive art collection and more multimedia displays on the history of the sport.<ref name=EvolvedPt1 />\n\n==Horses in the Hall of Fame==\n[[File:HorseracingHallofFame.jpg|thumb|The Hall of Fame gallery at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga]]\nIn the early years, inductions to the hall of fame were based on the evaluation of a panel of racing historians. In 1955, a group of 9 horses from the earliest years of the American turf were inducted.<ref name=\"EvolvedPt2\">{{cite web |title=Hall of Fame: Humble Beginnings (Cont.) |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192191/hall-of-fame-humble-beginnings-cont |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> The 1956 class included 11 horses that raced around the turn of the century, while the 1957 class included 10 horses that raced up to the mid-thirties. Since then, the classes have been significantly smaller as the inductions shifted to more contemporary horses. Under current rules, a horse must have been retired for a minimum of five full calendar years to be eligible for the hall of fame. Thoroughbreds remain eligible in the contemporary category between five and 25 calendar years following their final racing year.
