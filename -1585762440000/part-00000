The band worked on the album for close to three years and it was their first album of new material since 1999's ''[[Wonderful (Madness album)|Wonderful]]''.\n\n==Content==\nThe 10-minute title track recounts the social history of a corner of east London that until 1900 was controlled by [[St Paul's Cathedral]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=15885 |title=The Liberty of Norton Folgate Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts.com |date=22 May 2009 |accessdate=4 October 2010}}</ref> As a \"[[Liberty (division)|liberty]]\" it was not legally independent, but the rights of the Crown over the land had been waived. A shortened version of the track \"The Liberty of Norton Folgate\" was made available on YouTube in mid May 2008. In December a boxset of the album was offered for pre-order on the Madness website; those who ordered were entitled to a digital download of the album on 20 December. Twenty-three tracks were recorded for the album, although fifteen made it on to the album to be released in May. The twelve tracks issued in the digital download leaked onto the internet on 25 December 2008.\nDuring concerts in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide at the end of March 2009, Suggs stated that \"[[Dust Devil (Madness song)|Dust Devil]]\" would be the second single off the new album; second when accounting for the 2008 release of \"[[NW5]]\". It was released on 11 May, one week before the album. A third single, \"[[Sugar and Spice (Madness song)|Sugar and Spice]]\" (with slightly different lyrics and intro to the album version) was released to radio in July, and on 21 July it was confirmed that it would be made available as a [[download single]] from 2 August on [[iTunes]] and 3 August from other retailers.\n\nIn November 2009 the band announced the release of a fourth single scheduled for 11 January 2010: \"[[Forever Young (Madness song)|Forever Young]]\", a favourite of both fans and band. Apart from several remixes, one of the single formats contains Love Really Hurts (Without You), a Dangermen era cover of the Billy Ocean classic. The release was put back one week and the single was released on 18 January, becoming the second single from the album to fail to chart.\n\nIt was produced by [[Clive Langer]] and [[Alan Winstanley]], who have worked with Madness on all but one of their albums. Recording sessions also took place in Toe Rag studios in late 2006 with [[Liam Watson (record producer)|Liam Watson]], who engineered and mixed ''[[Elephant (album)|Elephant]]'' by [[The White Stripes]].\n\nThe band showcased a number of songs from the new album during three concerts at London's [[Hackney Empire]] in June 2008.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}} [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1585403|pure_url=yes}} link]\n|rev2=[[BBC]]|rev2Score= (favourable) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/fdbd link]\n|rev3=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|rev3Score= {{Rating|4|5}} [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/cdreviews/5307178/Madness-The-Liberty-of-Norton-Folgate---review.html link]\n|rev4=''[[Evening Standard]]|rev4Score= {{Rating|4|5}} [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/music/article-23692961-details/CDs+of+the+week/article.do link]\n|rev5=''[[Financial Times]]''|rev5Score= {{Rating|5|5}} [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/37bcb990-46f5-11de-923e-00144feabdc0.html link]\n|rev6=''[[Hot Press (magazine)|Hot Press]]''|rev6Score= (4/5)\n|rev7=''[[The Independent]]''|rev7Score= {{Rating|4|5}} [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-madness-the-liberty-of-norton-folgate-lucky-seven-1689046.html link]\n|rev8=''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''|rev8Score= {{Rating|4|5}}\n|rev9=''MusicOMH'' |rev9Score={{Rating|4.5|5}} [http://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/madness-the-liberty-of-norton-folgate link]\n|rev10=''[[PopMatters]]''|rev10Score= {{Rating|9|10}} [http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/107307-madness-the-liberty-of-norton-folgate/ link]\n|rev11=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|rev11Score= {{Rating|3|5}} [https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/28772704/review/29716077/the_liberty_of_norton_folgate link]\n|rev12=''[[Scotland on Sunday]]''|rev12Score= {{Rating|5|5}} [http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/entertainment/Album-review-Madness--The.5272762.jp link]\n|rev14=''[[The Times]]'' |rev14Score={{Rating|4|5}} [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/cd_reviews/article6279539.ece link]\n|rev15=''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' |rev15Score={{Rating|4|5}} [http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/madness/reviews/13077 link]     }}\nCritical reception to ''The Liberty of Norton Folgate'' was highly positive, with most critics hailing it as Madness's best album in their thirty-year career.

A shortened version of the track \"The Liberty of Norton Folgate\" was made available on YouTube in mid May 2008. In December a boxset of the album was offered for pre-order on the Madness website; those who ordered were entitled to a digital download of the album on 20 December. Twenty-three tracks were recorded for the album, although fifteen made it on to the album to be released in May. The twelve tracks issued in the digital download leaked onto the internet on 25 December 2008.\nDuring concerts in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide at the end of March 2009, Suggs stated that \"[[Dust Devil (Madness song)|Dust Devil]]\" would be the second single off the new album; second when accounting for the 2008 release of [[NW5]]. It was released on 11 May, one week before the album. A third single, \"[[Sugar and Spice (Madness song)|Sugar and Spice]]\" (with slightly different lyrics and intro to the album version) was released to radio in July, and on 21 July it was confirmed that it would be made available as a [[download single]] from 2 August on [[iTunes]] and 3 August from other retailers.\n\nIn November 2009 the band announced the release of a fourth single scheduled for 11 January 2010: \"[[Forever Young (Madness song)|Forever Young]]\", a favourite of both fans and band. Apart from several remixes, one of the single formats contains Love Really Hurts (Without You), a Dangermen era cover of the Billy Ocean classic. The release was put back one week and the single was released on 18 January, becoming the second single from the album to fail to chart.\n\nIt was produced by [[Clive Langer]] and [[Alan Winstanley]], who have worked with Madness on all but one of their albums. Recording sessions also took place in Toe Rag studios in late 2006 with [[Liam Watson (record producer)|Liam Watson]], who engineered and mixed ''[[Elephant (album)|Elephant]]'' by [[The White Stripes]].\n\nThe band showcased a number of songs from the new album during three concerts at London's [[Hackney Empire]] in June 2008.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}} [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1585403|pure_url=yes}} link]\n|rev2=[[BBC]]|rev2Score= (favourable) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/fdbd link]\n|rev3=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|rev3Score= {{Rating|4|5}} [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/cdreviews/5307178/Madness-The-Liberty-of-Norton-Folgate---review.html link]\n|rev4=''[[Evening Standard]]|rev4Score= {{Rating|4|5}} [http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/music/article-23692961-details/CDs+of+the+week/article.do link]\n|rev5=''[[Financial Times]]''|rev5Score= {{Rating|5|5}} [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/37bcb990-46f5-11de-923e-00144feabdc0.html link]\n|rev6=''[[Hot Press (magazine)|Hot Press]]''|rev6Score= (4/5)\n|rev7=''[[The Independent]]''|rev7Score= {{Rating|4|5}} [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-madness-the-liberty-of-norton-folgate-lucky-seven-1689046.html link]\n|rev8=''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''|rev8Score= {{Rating|4|5}}\n|rev9=''MusicOMH'' |rev9Score={{Rating|4.5|5}} [http://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/madness-the-liberty-of-norton-folgate link]\n|rev10=''[[PopMatters]]''|rev10Score= {{Rating|9|10}} [http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/107307-madness-the-liberty-of-norton-folgate/ link]\n|rev11=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|rev11Score= {{Rating|3|5}} [https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/28772704/review/29716077/the_liberty_of_norton_folgate link]\n|rev12=''[[Scotland on Sunday]]''|rev12Score= {{Rating|5|5}} [http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/entertainment/Album-review-Madness--The.5272762.jp link]\n|rev14=''[[The Times]]'' |rev14Score={{Rating|4|5}} [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/cd_reviews/article6279539.ece link]\n|rev15=''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' |rev15Score={{Rating|4|5}} [http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/madness/reviews/13077 link]     }}\nCritical reception to ''The Liberty of Norton Folgate'' was highly positive, with most critics hailing it as Madness's best album in their thirty-year career.

(1994). Empirical Evidence Regarding the Folk Psychological Concept of Belief. Proceedings of the ''Sixteenth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society'', 403-408. Hillsdale, New Jersey. (Atlanta, Georgia).</ref>), the use of empirical methods in philosophy far predates the emergence of the recent academic field. Current experimental philosophers claim that the movement is actually a return to the methodology used by many ancient philosophers.<ref name=\"KnobeJoshua\" /><ref name=\"KnobeJoshua_a\" /> Further, other philosophers like [[David Hume]], [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and [[John Locke]] are often held up as early models of philosophers who appealed to empirical methodology.<ref name=\"EdmondsDavid\" /><ref>Peter Anstey, \"[https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/2010/08/is-x-phi-old-hat/ Is x-phi old hat?]\", ''[https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi Early Modern Experimental Philosophy Blog]'', 30 August 2010.</ref>\n\n==Areas of research==\n\n===Consciousness===\nThe questions of what [[consciousness]] is, and what conditions are necessary for conscious thought have been the topic of a long-standing philosophical debate. Experimental philosophers have approached this question by trying to get a better grasp on how exactly people ordinarily understand consciousness. For instance, work by [[Joshua Knobe]] and [[Jesse Prinz]] (2008) suggests that people may have two different ways of understanding minds generally, and Justin Sytsma and Edouard Machery (2009) have written about the proper methodology for studying [[Folk psychology|folk intuitions about consciousness]]. Bryce Huebner, Michael Bruno, and Hagop Sarkissian (2010)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Huebner | first1 = B. | last2 = Bruno | first2 = M. | last3 = Sarkissian | first3 = H. | year = 2010 | title = What Does the Nation of China Think about Phenomenal States? | url = | journal = Review of Philosophy and Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 225\u2013243 | doi=10.1007/s13164-009-0009-0}}</ref> have further argued that the way Westerners understand consciousness differs systematically from the way that East Asians understand consciousness, while Adam Arico (2010)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Arico | first1 = A | year = 2010 | title = Folk Psychology, Consciousness, and Context Effects | url = | journal = Review of Philosophy and Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 371\u2013393 | doi=10.1007/s13164-010-0029-9}}</ref> has offered some evidence for thinking that ordinary ascriptions of consciousness are sensitive to framing effects (such as the presence or absence of contextual information). Some of this work has been featured in the [[Online Consciousness Conference]].\n\nOther experimental philosophers have approached the topic of consciousness by trying to uncover the cognitive processes that guide everyday attributions of conscious states. Adam Arico, Brian Fiala, Rob Goldberg, and [[Shaun Nichols]],<ref>Arico, A., Fiala, B., Goldberg, R., and Nichols, S. forthcoming. ''Mind & Language''.</ref> for instance, propose a cognitive model of mental state attribution (the AGENCY model), whereby an entity's displaying certain relatively simple features (e.g., eyes, distinctive motions, interactive behavior) triggers a disposition to attribute conscious states to that entity. Additionally, Bryce Huebner<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Huebner | first1 = B | year = 2010 | title = Commonsense Concepts of Phenomenal Consciousness: Does Anyone ''Care'' about Functional Zombies? | url = | journal = Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 133\u2013155 | doi=10.1007/s11097-009-9126-6}}</ref> has argued that ascriptions of mental states rely on two divergent strategies: one sensitive to considerations of an entity's behavior being goal-directed; the other sensitive to considerations of personhood.\n\n===Cultural diversity===\nFollowing the work of [[Richard Nisbett]], which showed that there were differences in a wide range of cognitive tasks between Westerners and East Asians, Jonathan Weinberg, [[Shaun Nichols]] and [[Stephen Stich]] (2001) compared [[epistemology|epistemic]] [[Intuition (philosophy)|intuitions]] of Western college students and East Asian college students. The students were presented with a number of cases, including some [[Gettier problem|Gettier cases]], and asked to judge whether a person in the case really knew some fact or merely believed it. They found that the East Asian subjects were more likely to judge that the subjects really knew.<ref>Weinberg, J., [[Shaun Nichols|Nichols, S.]], & [[Stephen Stich|Stich, S.]] (2001).

People who hold this view are often referred to as \u2018[[Compatibilism|compatibilists]].\u2019 It was generally claimed that non-philosophers were naturally incompatibilist,<ref>Nahmias, E., Morris, S., Nadelhoffer, T. & Turner, J.

Work by [[Joshua Knobe]] has especially been influential.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} \"The Knobe Effect\", as it is often called, concerns an asymmetry in our judgments of whether an [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] intentionally performed an action.  Knobe (2003a) asked people to suppose that the [[CEO]] of a corporation is presented with a proposal that would, as a side effect, affect the environment.  In one version of the scenario, the effect on the environment will be negative (it will \"harm\" it), while in another version the effect on the environment will be positive (it will \"help\" it). In both cases, the CEO opts to pursue the policy and the effect does occur (the environment is harmed or helped by the policy). However, the CEO only adopts the program because he wants to raise [[Profit (accounting)|profits]]; he does not care about the effect that the action will have on the environment. Although all features of the scenarios are held constant\u2014except for whether the side effect on the environment will be positive or negative\u2014a majority of people judge that the CEO intentionally hurt the environment in the one case, but did not intentionally help it in the other.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Knobe ultimately argues that the effect is a reflection of a feature of the speakers' underlying concept of intentional action: broadly moral considerations affect whether we judge that an action is performed intentionally. However, his exact views have changed in response to further research.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Predicting philosophical disagreement===\nResearch suggests that some fundamental philosophical intuitions are related to stable individual differences in personality.  Although there are notable limits,<ref>Doris, J. (2005). Lack of Character.

A great deal of the experiments fail to include enough female participants. Analysis of experimental data is often plagued by improper use of statistics, and reliance on [[data mining]]. Others have pointed out that many participants in experimental philosophy studies fail to comprehend the often abstract and complicated materials, and few studies report comprehension checks.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00215|title = Forget the Folk: Moral Responsibility Preservation Motives and Other Conditions for Compatibilism|journal = Frontiers in Psychology|year = 2019|last1 = Clark|first1 = Cory J.|last2 = Winegard|first2 = Bo M.|last3 = Baumeister|first3 = Roy F.}}</ref> Holtzman argues that a number of experimental philosophers are guilty of [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|suppressing evidence]]. Yet, in lumping together all people's intuitions as those of the 'folk,' critics may be ignoring basic concerns identified by [[Standpoint feminism|standpoint feminists]].\n\nSome research in experimental philosophy is misleading because it examines averaged responses to surveys even though in almost all of the studies in experimental philosophy there have been substantial dissenting minorities. Ignoring individual differences may result in a distorted view of folk intuitions or concepts. This may lead to theoretical and strange fictions about everyday intuitions or concepts that experimental philosophy was designed to avoid akin to creating the fiction that the average human is not a man or a woman, but the average of a man and woman (e.g., the average person has one ovary and one testicle).<ref>Feltz, A., & Cokely, E.T., (in press).

A large amount of research also focused on epistemology as [[Stephen Stich]] argued early on that findings reported by him and co-authors suggested that long practiced methods in philosophy had to be discarded, famously noting that in light of their findings a \"reasonable conclusion is that philosophy's 2400 year long infatuation with Plato's method has been a terrible mistake.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stich|first=Stephen|date=2001-01-01|title=Plato's Method Meets Cognitive Science|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/STIPMM|journal=Free Inquiry|volume=21|issue=2|pages=36\u201338}}</ref> Since publication of Seyedsayamdost's papers, Stich and collaborators have reversed their research direction on this question.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Machery|first=Edouard|last2=Stich|first2=Stephen|last3=Rose|first3=David|last4=Chatterjee|first4=Amita|last5=Karasawa|first5=Kaori|last6=Struchiner|first6=Noel|last7=Sirker|first7=Smita|last8=Usui|first8=Naoki|last9=Hashimoto|first9=Takaaki|date=2015-01-01|title=Gettier Across Cultures|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MACGAC-4|journal=No\u00fbs|volume=50|issue=4}}</ref>\n\nThe reason for these problems in experimental philosophy is not entirely clear.

(1994). Empirical Evidence Regarding the Folk Psychological Concept of Belief. Proceedings of the ''Sixteenth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society'', 403-408. Hillsdale, New Jersey.

Current experimental philosophers claim that the movement is actually a return to the methodology used by many ancient philosophers.<ref name=\"KnobeJoshua\" /><ref name=\"KnobeJoshua_a\" /> Further, other philosophers like [[David Hume]], [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] and [[John Locke]] are often held up as early models of philosophers who appealed to empirical methodology.<ref name=\"EdmondsDavid\" /><ref>Peter Anstey, \"[https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/2010/08/is-x-phi-old-hat/ Is x-phi old hat?]\", ''[https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi Early Modern Experimental Philosophy Blog]'', 30 August 2010.</ref>\n\n==Areas of research==\n\n===Consciousness===\nThe questions of what [[consciousness]] is, and what conditions are necessary for conscious thought have been the topic of a long-standing philosophical debate. Experimental philosophers have approached this question by trying to get a better grasp on how exactly people ordinarily understand consciousness. For instance, work by [[Joshua Knobe]] and [[Jesse Prinz]] (2008) suggests that people may have two different ways of understanding minds generally, and Justin Sytsma and Edouard Machery (2009) have written about the proper methodology for studying [[Folk psychology|folk intuitions about consciousness]].

Some of this work has been featured in the [[Online Consciousness Conference]].\n\nOther experimental philosophers have approached the topic of consciousness by trying to uncover the cognitive processes that guide everyday attributions of conscious states. Adam Arico, Brian Fiala, Rob Goldberg, and [[Shaun Nichols]],<ref>Arico, A., Fiala, B., Goldberg, R., and Nichols, S. forthcoming. ''Mind & Language''.</ref> for instance, propose a cognitive model of mental state attribution (the AGENCY model), whereby an entity's displaying certain relatively simple features (e.g., eyes, distinctive motions, interactive behavior) triggers a disposition to attribute conscious states to that entity. Additionally, Bryce Huebner<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Huebner | first1 = B | year = 2010 | title = Commonsense Concepts of Phenomenal Consciousness: Does Anyone ''Care'' about Functional Zombies? | url = | journal = Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 133\u2013155 | doi=10.1007/s11097-009-9126-6}}</ref> has argued that ascriptions of mental states rely on two divergent strategies: one sensitive to considerations of an entity's behavior being goal-directed; the other sensitive to considerations of personhood.\n\n===Cultural diversity===\nFollowing the work of [[Richard Nisbett]], which showed that there were differences in a wide range of cognitive tasks between Westerners and East Asians, Jonathan Weinberg, [[Shaun Nichols]] and [[Stephen Stich]] (2001) compared [[epistemology|epistemic]] [[Intuition (philosophy)|intuitions]] of Western college students and East Asian college students. The students were presented with a number of cases, including some [[Gettier problem|Gettier cases]], and asked to judge whether a person in the case really knew some fact or merely believed it. They found that the East Asian subjects were more likely to judge that the subjects really knew.<ref>Weinberg, J., [[Shaun Nichols|Nichols, S.]], & [[Stephen Stich|Stich, S.]] (2001).

One side of the debate, the proponents of which are called \u2018[[Incompatibilism|incompatibilists]],\u2019 argue that there is no way for people to be morally responsible for immoral acts if they could not have done otherwise. The other side of the debate argues instead that people can be morally responsible for their immoral actions even when they could not have done otherwise. People who hold this view are often referred to as \u2018[[Compatibilism|compatibilists]].\u2019 It was generally claimed that non-philosophers were naturally incompatibilist,<ref>Nahmias, E., Morris, S., Nadelhoffer, T. & Turner, J.

Then the person does something morally wrong, and people are asked if that person is morally responsible for what she or he did.

Work by [[Joshua Knobe]] has especially been influential.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} \"The Knobe Effect\", as it is often called, concerns an asymmetry in our judgments of whether an [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] intentionally performed an action.  Knobe (2003a) asked people to suppose that the [[CEO]] of a corporation is presented with a proposal that would, as a side effect, affect the environment.  In one version of the scenario, the effect on the environment will be negative (it will \"harm\" it), while in another version the effect on the environment will be positive (it will \"help\" it). In both cases, the CEO opts to pursue the policy and the effect does occur (the environment is harmed or helped by the policy). However, the CEO only adopts the program because he wants to raise [[Profit (accounting)|profits]]; he does not care about the effect that the action will have on the environment. Although all features of the scenarios are held constant\u2014except for whether the side effect on the environment will be positive or negative\u2014a majority of people judge that the CEO intentionally hurt the environment in the one case, but did not intentionally help it in the other.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Knobe ultimately argues that the effect is a reflection of a feature of the speakers' underlying concept of intentional action: broadly moral considerations affect whether we judge that an action is performed intentionally. However, his exact views have changed in response to further research.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Predicting philosophical disagreement===\nResearch suggests that some fundamental philosophical intuitions are related to stable individual differences in personality.  Although there are notable limits,<ref>Doris, J. (2005). Lack of Character.

A great deal of the experiments fail to include enough female participants. Analysis of experimental data is often plagued by improper use of statistics, and reliance on [[data mining]]. Others have pointed out that many participants in experimental philosophy studies fail to comprehend the often abstract and complicated materials, and few studies report comprehension checks.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00215|title = Forget the Folk: Moral Responsibility Preservation Motives and Other Conditions for Compatibilism|journal = Frontiers in Psychology|year = 2019|last1 = Clark|first1 = Cory J.|last2 = Winegard|first2 = Bo M.|last3 = Baumeister|first3 = Roy F.}}</ref> Holtzman argues that a number of experimental philosophers are guilty of [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|suppressing evidence]]. Yet, in lumping together all people's intuitions as those of the 'folk,' critics may be ignoring basic concerns identified by [[Standpoint feminism|standpoint feminists]].\n\nSome research in experimental philosophy is misleading because it examines averaged responses to surveys even though in almost all of the studies in experimental philosophy there have been substantial dissenting minorities. Ignoring individual differences may result in a distorted view of folk intuitions or concepts. This may lead to theoretical and strange fictions about everyday intuitions or concepts that experimental philosophy was designed to avoid akin to creating the fiction that the average human is not a man or a woman, but the average of a man and woman (e.g., the average person has one ovary and one testicle).<ref>Feltz, A., & Cokely, E.T., (in press).

A large amount of research also focused on epistemology as [[Stephen Stich]] argued early on that findings reported by him and co-authors suggested that long practiced methods in philosophy had to be discarded, famously noting that in light of their findings a \"reasonable conclusion is that philosophy's 2400 year long infatuation with Plato's method has been a terrible mistake.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stich|first=Stephen|date=2001-01-01|title=Plato's Method Meets Cognitive Science|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/STIPMM|journal=Free Inquiry|volume=21|issue=2|pages=36\u201338}}</ref> Since publication of Seyedsayamdost's papers, Stich and collaborators have reversed their research direction on this question.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Machery|first=Edouard|last2=Stich|first2=Stephen|last3=Rose|first3=David|last4=Chatterjee|first4=Amita|last5=Karasawa|first5=Kaori|last6=Struchiner|first6=Noel|last7=Sirker|first7=Smita|last8=Usui|first8=Naoki|last9=Hashimoto|first9=Takaaki|date=2015-01-01|title=Gettier Across Cultures|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/MACGAC-4|journal=No\u00fbs|volume=50|issue=4}}</ref>\n\nThe reason for these problems in experimental philosophy is not entirely clear.

He played primarily for the [[Seattle Mariners]] and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. His [[300 win club|303 career victories]] rank as the fifth-most by a left-hander in MLB history, while his [[3,000 strikeout club|4,875 strikeouts]] place him second all-time behind [[Nolan Ryan]] and are the most by a left-hander. He holds five of the seven highest single-season [[strikeout]] totals by a left-hander in modern history. Johnson won the [[Cy Young Award]] five times, second only to [[Roger Clemens]]' seven, and he is one of only two pitchers (the other being [[Greg Maddux]]) to win the award in four consecutive seasons (1999\u20132002). In 1999, he joined [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]] and [[Gaylord Perry]] in the rare feat of winning the award in both the [[American League|American]] and [[National League|National]] Leagues (a feat since accomplished by Clemens, [[Roy Halladay]], and [[Max Scherzer]]). He is also one of five pitchers to pitch [[No-hitter|no-hitters]] in both leagues. On May 18, 2004, at the age of 40, Johnson became the oldest pitcher in major league history to throw a [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]], and is one of seven pitchers who have thrown both a perfect game and a no-hitter in their careers. He is also one of 18 pitchers in history to record a [[Major league pitchers beating all 30 teams|win against all 30 MLB franchises]]. On May 8th 2001, Johnson achieved the feat of striking out 20 batters in one game, doing so against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. \n\nOne of the tallest players in major league history at {{convert|6|ft|10|in|m}}, and a ten-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], Johnson was celebrated for having one of the most dominant [[Fastball|fastballs]] in the game. He regularly approached \u2013 and occasionally exceeded \u2013 {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h}}, during his prime. Johnson also threw a hard, biting [[Slider (baseball)|slider]]. After struggling early in his career (having won only 64 games by his 30th birthday), he went on to lead his league in strikeouts nine times, and in [[earned run average]], [[win\u2013loss record (pitching)|winning percentage]], and [[Complete game|complete games]] four times each. Johnson was named one of two (along with [[Curt Schilling]]) [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|World Series Most Valuable Players]] in [[2001 World Series|2001]], with three pitching victories, leading the Diamondbacks to a World Series championship over the [[New York Yankees]] in only Arizona's fourth season. He won the pitching [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]] in 2002.\n\nJohnson's .646 career winning percentage ranks sixth among left-handers with at least 200 decisions; among southpaws, he ranks eighth in [[games started]] (603) and ninth in [[innings pitched]] ({{frac|4,135|1|3}}). Johnson's career elite rankings also include: first in [[strikeouts per nine innings pitched]] (10.67), third in [[hit by pitch|hit batsmen]] (188), and tenth in fewest hits allowed per nine innings pitched (7.24). He was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[2015 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2015]], his first year of eligibility, and is the first member of the Hall to be depicted in a Diamondbacks uniform on his plaque.\n\n==Early life==\nJohnson was born in [[Walnut Creek, California]], to Carol Hannah and Rollen Charles \"Bud\" Johnson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/rjohnson.htm|accessdate=January 6, 2010|title=1. Randall David (\"Randy\") Johnson|work=[[rootsweb]]|publisher=[[Ancestry.com]]}}</ref> By the time he entered [[Livermore High School]], he was a star in baseball and [[basketball]]. In 1982, as a senior, he struck out 121 batters in 66 innings, and threw a [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] in his last high school start. He also played on a Bercovich team that assembled top players from throughout California. After high school, he was drafted in 1982 by the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the 4th round and offered $50,000 to sign. Instead, Johnson accepted a full athletic scholarship to play baseball for the [[USC Trojans baseball|University of Southern California]]. While at USC, he also played two years of [[basketball]]. He was a starter at USC (where he was a teammate of [[Mark McGwire]]) under coach [[Rod Dedeaux]], but often exhibited control problems.\n\n==Major league career (1988\u20132009)==\n\n===Montreal Expos (1988\u20131989)===\nJohnson was drafted by the [[Montreal Expos]] in the second round of the [[1985 Major League Baseball draft]]. He made his major league debut on September 15, 1988 against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], earning a 9&ndash;4 victory with a five-inning outing in which he gave up two runs with five strikeouts; his first victim was [[Orestes Destrade]] in the second inning. Johnson posted a record of 3&ndash;0 with a 2.42 earned run average (ERA) in four games in 1988, but 1989 saw him slip to an 0&ndash;4 mark with a 6.67 ERA in seven games through May 7, and on May 25 he was traded to the [[Seattle Mariners]] in a trade involving five pitchers that brought [[Mark Langston]] to Montreal. In 11 total games played with the Expos, he went 3\u20134 with a 4.69 ERA and one complete game in 55.2 innings with 51 strikeouts and 33 walks.\n\n===Seattle Mariners (1989\u20131998)===\n====1989\u20131992====\nAfter joining the Mariners during the [[1989 Seattle Mariners season|1989 season]], Johnson led the American League in walks for three consecutive seasons (1990\u20131992), and hit batsmen in 1992 and 1993. In July 1991, facing the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], the erratic Johnson allowed 4 runs on 1 hit, thanks to 10 walks in 4 innings. A month later, a 9th-inning single cost him a no-hitter against the [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]. Johnson suffered another 10-walk, 4-inning start in 1992.\n\nHis untapped talent was volcanic: In 1990, Johnson became the first left-hander to strike out [[Wade Boggs]] three times in one game, and a no-hitter against the [[1990 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] attested to his potential. Johnson credits a session with [[Nolan Ryan]] late in the 1992 season with helping him take his career to the next level; Ryan has said that he appreciated Johnson's talent and did not want to see him take as long to figure certain things out as he had taken. Ryan recommended a slight change in his delivery; before the meeting, Johnson would land on the heel of his foot after delivering a pitch, and he therefore usually landed offline from home plate. Ryan suggested that he land on the ball of his foot, and almost immediately, he began finding the strike zone more consistently.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/RJohnson/RJohnson_bio.html |title=Randy Johnson Biography |publisher=JockBio |date=September 10, 1963 |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref> In a September 27, 1992 game against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], with Ryan the opposing starting pitcher, Johnson struck out 18 batters in eight innings while throwing 160 pitches, a pitch count that has not been reached in an MLB game since.<ref name=kepner>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E0DE113BF934A35752C0A9669D8B63|title=AN APPRECIATION; Worth Watching, From Start to Finish|first=Tyler|last=Kepner|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=December 1, 2011}}</ref> It was during the 1992 off-season when Johnson returned home for Christmas only to lose his father to an  [[aortic aneurysm]].

In May 1993, Johnson again lost a no-hitter to a 9th-inning single; again, the opponent was the Oakland Athletics. He also recorded his 1,000th career strikeout against the [[1993 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]]' [[Chuck Knoblauch]]. Prior to the trade deadline, Johnson was nearly dealt to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for [[Steve Karsay]] and [[Mike Timlin]]. Toronto general manager [[Pat Gillick]] had two separate transactions on the table including the one for Johnson with Seattle general manager [[Woody Woodward]] and one for [[Rickey Henderson]] with Oakland general manager [[Sandy Alderson]]. When Gillick was unable to contact Woodward he agreed to utilize the deal with Alderson. When Woodward returned Gillick's call he said he would agree to the deal for Johnson. However, Gillick gave his word to Alderson even though the deal had not been finalized.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bluejayhunter.com/2012/01/randy-johnson-almost-traded-to-blue.html|title=Randy Johnson Almost Traded to the Blue Jays}}</ref> At the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1993 All-Star Game]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], in a famous incident, Johnson threw a fastball over the head of [[Philadelphia Phillies]] first baseman [[John Kruk]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB2A5104290F467&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePMA|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=July 18, 1993|page=E07|title=AN ALL-STAR STRIKEOUT THAT WAS GOOD FOR SOME LAUGHS JOHN KRUK MAY HAVE LOOKED A BIT OVERMATCHED AGAINST \\ RANDY JOHNSON.

His .900 winning percentage was the second highest in AL history, behind [[Johnny Allen (baseball)|Johnny Allen]], who had gone 15\u20131 for the [[Cleveland Indians]] in 1937. Johnson became the first regular starting pitcher in history to strike out more than a third of all batters faced. He also became the first Seattle Mariners pitcher to win the Cy Young Award, and the only one until [[F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez]] took home the honor in [[2010 Seattle Mariners season|2010]].\n\nJohnson capped the Mariners' late season comeback by pitching a three-hitter in the AL West's one-game playoff, crushing the [[1995 California Angels season|California Angels]]' hopes with 12 strikeouts. Thus unable to start in the 5-game [[1995 American League Division Series|ALDS]] series against the [[1995 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] until the third game, Johnson watched as New York took a 2\u20130 series lead.  He defeated the Yankees in Game 3 with 10 strikeouts in seven innings.\n\nWhen the series went the full five games, the Mariners having come back from an 0\u20132 deficit to win both games at the [[Kingdome]], Johnson made a dramatic relief appearance in the series final, Game 5, on only one day's rest. Entering a 4\u20134 game in the ninth inning, Johnson pitched the ninth, 10th, and 11th innings. He allowed one run, struck out six, and held on for the series-ending win in Seattle's dramatic comeback.\n\nJohnson posted an 0\u20136 playoff record in his next four playoff series, each of which his teams lost.\n\n====1996\u22121998====\nJohnson was sidelined throughout much of the 1996 season with a back injury, but he rebounded in [[1997 Seattle Mariners season|1997]] with a 20\u20134 record, 291 strikeouts, and a 2.28 ERA (his personal best). Between May 1994 and October 1997, Johnson had gone 53\u20139, including a 16\u20130 streak that fell one short of the AL record.

Johnson led the major leagues in strikeouts (with 290). In the games where Arizona scored three or more runs, Johnson was 13\u20132.

In Game 5 in Anaheim, Johnson made an effective relief appearance after [[Mike Mussina]] gave up 5 runs and 6 hits to give the Angels a 5\u20132 lead, but the Yankees were unable to come back in the series.\n\nAfter an inconclusive year in pinstripes, New York fans hoped that Johnson would return to his dominant style in his second Yankee season. Johnson began 2006 well, but then he struggled to find form. In between some impressive performances, he allowed 5 or more runs in 7 of his first 18 starts for the season. Johnson was more effective in the second half. Johnson finished the season with a 17\u201311 record, a subpar 5.00 ERA with 172 strikeouts. It was revealed at the end of the 2006 season that a herniated disc in Johnson's back had been stiffening him and it was only in his second to last start of the season that he decided to get it checked. This exposure caused him to miss his last start of 2006.

[[Americans|American]] former [[Professional baseball|professional baseball]] [[Pitcher|pitcher]] who played 22 seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), from 1988 to 2009, for six teams. He played primarily for the [[Seattle Mariners]] and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. His [[300 win club|303 career victories]] rank as the fifth-most by a left-hander in MLB history, while his [[3,000 strikeout club|4,875 strikeouts]] place him second all-time behind [[Nolan Ryan]] and are the most by a left-hander. He holds five of the seven highest single-season [[strikeout]] totals by a left-hander in modern history. Johnson won the [[Cy Young Award]] five times, second only to [[Roger Clemens]]' seven, and he is one of only two pitchers (the other being [[Greg Maddux]]) to win the award in four consecutive seasons (1999\u20132002). In 1999, he joined [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]] and [[Gaylord Perry]] in the rare feat of winning the award in both the [[American League|American]] and [[National League|National]] Leagues (a feat since accomplished by Clemens, [[Roy Halladay]], and [[Max Scherzer]]). He is also one of five pitchers to pitch [[No-hitter|no-hitters]] in both leagues. On May 18, 2004, at the age of 40, Johnson became the oldest pitcher in major league history to throw a [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]], and is one of seven pitchers who have thrown both a perfect game and a no-hitter in their careers. He is also one of 18 pitchers in history to record a [[Major league pitchers beating all 30 teams|win against all 30 MLB franchises]]. On May 8th 2001, Johnson achieved the feat of striking out 20 batters in one game, doing so against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. \n\nOne of the tallest players in major league history at {{convert|6|ft|10|in|m}}, and a ten-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], Johnson was celebrated for having one of the most dominant [[Fastball|fastballs]] in the game. He regularly approached \u2013 and occasionally exceeded \u2013 {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h}}, during his prime. Johnson also threw a hard, biting [[Slider (baseball)|slider]]. After struggling early in his career (having won only 64 games by his 30th birthday), he went on to lead his league in strikeouts nine times, and in [[earned run average]], [[win\u2013loss record (pitching)|winning percentage]], and [[Complete game|complete games]] four times each. Johnson was named one of two (along with [[Curt Schilling]]) [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|World Series Most Valuable Players]] in [[2001 World Series|2001]], with three pitching victories, leading the Diamondbacks to a World Series championship over the [[New York Yankees]] in only Arizona's fourth season. He won the pitching [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]] in 2002.\n\nJohnson's .646 career winning percentage ranks sixth among left-handers with at least 200 decisions; among southpaws, he ranks eighth in [[games started]] (603) and ninth in [[innings pitched]] ({{frac|4,135|1|3}}). Johnson's career elite rankings also include: first in [[strikeouts per nine innings pitched]] (10.67), third in [[hit by pitch|hit batsmen]] (188), and tenth in fewest hits allowed per nine innings pitched (7.24). He was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[2015 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2015]], his first year of eligibility, and is the first member of the Hall to be depicted in a Diamondbacks uniform on his plaque.\n\n==Early life==\nJohnson was born in [[Walnut Creek, California]], to Carol Hannah and Rollen Charles \"Bud\" Johnson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/rjohnson.htm|accessdate=January 6, 2010|title=1. Randall David (\"Randy\") Johnson|work=[[rootsweb]]|publisher=[[Ancestry.com]]}}</ref> By the time he entered [[Livermore High School]], he was a star in baseball and [[basketball]]. In 1982, as a senior, he struck out 121 batters in 66 innings, and threw a [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] in his last high school start. He also played on a Bercovich team that assembled top players from throughout California. After high school, he was drafted in 1982 by the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the 4th round and offered $50,000 to sign. Instead, Johnson accepted a full athletic scholarship to play baseball for the [[USC Trojans baseball|University of Southern California]]. While at USC, he also played two years of [[basketball]]. He was a starter at USC (where he was a teammate of [[Mark McGwire]]) under coach [[Rod Dedeaux]], but often exhibited control problems.\n\n==Major league career (1988\u20132009)==\n\n===Montreal Expos (1988\u20131989)===\nJohnson was drafted by the [[Montreal Expos]] in the second round of the [[1985 Major League Baseball draft]]. He made his major league debut on September 15, 1988 against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], earning a 9&ndash;4 victory with a five-inning outing in which he gave up two runs with five strikeouts; his first victim was [[Orestes Destrade]] in the second inning. Johnson posted a record of 3&ndash;0 with a 2.42 earned run average (ERA) in four games in 1988, but 1989 saw him slip to an 0&ndash;4 mark with a 6.67 ERA in seven games through May 7, and on May 25 he was traded to the [[Seattle Mariners]] in a trade involving five pitchers that brought [[Mark Langston]] to Montreal. In 11 total games played with the Expos, he went 3\u20134 with a 4.69 ERA and one complete game in 55.2 innings with 51 strikeouts and 33 walks.\n\n===Seattle Mariners (1989\u20131998)===\n====1989\u20131992====\nAfter joining the Mariners during the [[1989 Seattle Mariners season|1989 season]], Johnson led the American League in walks for three consecutive seasons (1990\u20131992), and hit batsmen in 1992 and 1993. In July 1991, facing the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], the erratic Johnson allowed 4 runs on 1 hit, thanks to 10 walks in 4 innings. A month later, a 9th-inning single cost him a no-hitter against the [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]. Johnson suffered another 10-walk, 4-inning start in 1992.\n\nHis untapped talent was volcanic: In 1990, Johnson became the first left-hander to strike out [[Wade Boggs]] three times in one game, and a no-hitter against the [[1990 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] attested to his potential. Johnson credits a session with [[Nolan Ryan]] late in the 1992 season with helping him take his career to the next level; Ryan has said that he appreciated Johnson's talent and did not want to see him take as long to figure certain things out as he had taken. Ryan recommended a slight change in his delivery; before the meeting, Johnson would land on the heel of his foot after delivering a pitch, and he therefore usually landed offline from home plate. Ryan suggested that he land on the ball of his foot, and almost immediately, he began finding the strike zone more consistently.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/RJohnson/RJohnson_bio.html |title=Randy Johnson Biography |publisher=JockBio |date=September 10, 1963 |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref> In a September 27, 1992 game against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], with Ryan the opposing starting pitcher, Johnson struck out 18 batters in eight innings while throwing 160 pitches, a pitch count that has not been reached in an MLB game since.<ref name=kepner>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E0DE113BF934A35752C0A9669D8B63|title=AN APPRECIATION; Worth Watching, From Start to Finish|first=Tyler|last=Kepner|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=December 1, 2011}}</ref> It was during the 1992 off-season when Johnson returned home for Christmas only to lose his father to an  [[aortic aneurysm]].

In May 1993, Johnson again lost a no-hitter to a 9th-inning single; again, the opponent was the Oakland Athletics. He also recorded his 1,000th career strikeout against the [[1993 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]]' [[Chuck Knoblauch]]. Prior to the trade deadline, Johnson was nearly dealt to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for [[Steve Karsay]] and [[Mike Timlin]]. Toronto general manager [[Pat Gillick]] had two separate transactions on the table including the one for Johnson with Seattle general manager [[Woody Woodward]] and one for [[Rickey Henderson]] with Oakland general manager [[Sandy Alderson]]. When Gillick was unable to contact Woodward he agreed to utilize the deal with Alderson. When Woodward returned Gillick's call he said he would agree to the deal for Johnson. However, Gillick gave his word to Alderson even though the deal had not been finalized.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bluejayhunter.com/2012/01/randy-johnson-almost-traded-to-blue.html|title=Randy Johnson Almost Traded to the Blue Jays}}</ref> At the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1993 All-Star Game]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], in a famous incident, Johnson threw a fastball over the head of [[Philadelphia Phillies]] first baseman [[John Kruk]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB2A5104290F467&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePMA|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=July 18, 1993|page=E07|title=AN ALL-STAR STRIKEOUT THAT WAS GOOD FOR SOME LAUGHS JOHN KRUK MAY HAVE LOOKED A BIT OVERMATCHED AGAINST \\ RANDY JOHNSON.

His .900 winning percentage was the second highest in AL history, behind [[Johnny Allen (baseball)|Johnny Allen]], who had gone 15\u20131 for the [[Cleveland Indians]] in 1937. Johnson became the first regular starting pitcher in history to strike out more than a third of all batters faced. He also became the first Seattle Mariners pitcher to win the Cy Young Award, and the only one until [[F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez]] took home the honor in [[2010 Seattle Mariners season|2010]].\n\nJohnson capped the Mariners' late season comeback by pitching a three-hitter in the AL West's one-game playoff, crushing the [[1995 California Angels season|California Angels]]' hopes with 12 strikeouts. Thus unable to start in the 5-game [[1995 American League Division Series|ALDS]] series against the [[1995 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] until the third game, Johnson watched as New York took a 2\u20130 series lead.  He defeated the Yankees in Game 3 with 10 strikeouts in seven innings.\n\nWhen the series went the full five games, the Mariners having come back from an 0\u20132 deficit to win both games at the [[Kingdome]], Johnson made a dramatic relief appearance in the series final, Game 5, on only one day's rest. Entering a 4\u20134 game in the ninth inning, Johnson pitched the ninth, 10th, and 11th innings. He allowed one run, struck out six, and held on for the series-ending win in Seattle's dramatic comeback.\n\nJohnson posted an 0\u20136 playoff record in his next four playoff series, each of which his teams lost.\n\n====1996\u22121998====\nJohnson was sidelined throughout much of the 1996 season with a back injury, but he rebounded in [[1997 Seattle Mariners season|1997]] with a 20\u20134 record, 291 strikeouts, and a 2.28 ERA (his personal best). Between May 1994 and October 1997, Johnson had gone 53\u20139, including a 16\u20130 streak that fell one short of the AL record. Johnson had two 19-strikeout starts in 1997, on June 24 and August 8.\n\nAnother colorful All-Star Game moment proceeded in the [[1997 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1997]] edition involving former Expos teammate [[Larry Walker]], at that point with the [[1997 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DP&p_theme=dp&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF884F1FF49657&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Walker gets Kruk off hook Wilting under Johnson's high heat|first=Jerry|last=Crasnick|authorlink=Jerry Crasnick |newspaper=[[Denver Post]]|date=July 9, 1997|page=D\u201301|accessdate=December 1, 2011}} {{subscription required|date=December 2011}}</ref>   When Johnson had started an interleague game versus the Rockies on June 12, Walker chose not to play, explaining that \"I faced Randy one time in [[spring training]] and he almost killed me.\"<ref>{{cite newspaper |author=[[Associated Press]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-06-12/sports/sp-2622_1_face-johnson |title=Walker will not face Johnson |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 12, 1997 |accessdate=February 4, 2017}}</ref>  In the All-Star Game, Walker batted against Johnson, who theatrically threw over his head.

On August 23, 2001, Johnson struck out three batters on nine pitches in the 6th inning of a 5\u20131 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates, becoming the 30th pitcher in major league history to pitch an [[List of Major League Baseball pitchers who have struck out three batters on nine pitches|immaculate inning]].\n\nIn 2002, Johnson won the pitching [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]], leading the NL in wins, ERA and strikeouts, and was voted his fourth consecutive Cy Young and Warren Spahn Awards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20030102&content_id=189354&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=null|first=Barry M.|last=Bloom|title=More hardware for Big Unit |work=[[MLB.com]] |publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media|MLB Advanced Media]] |date=August 21, 2002 |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}</ref> It was Johnson's fourth consecutive 300-strikeout season with the Diamondbacks, and fifth consecutive overall, extending his own MLB record from the previous season in which he set the record for the most consecutive seasons with 300 or more strikeouts in a season by a pitcher.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Gilbert |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/print.jsp?ymd=20090602&content_id=5109916&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=Unit's historic career like no other &#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref> He also became the first pitcher in baseball history to post a 24\u20135 record.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers: An Historical Compendium of Pitching, Pitchers, and Pitches: Books: Bill James, Rob Neyer |publisher=Amazon.com |isbn=0743261585 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/neyerjamesguidet00jame }}</ref>\n\nJohnson spent the majority of the 2003 season on the disabled list and was ineffective in the few injury-hampered starts he did make. He hit his first career home run in a September 19, 2003, game against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. It was the only home run to date for Johnson, a career .125 hitter.\n\nOn May 18, 2004, Johnson [[Randy Johnson's perfect game|pitched the 17th perfect game in baseball history]]. At 40 years of age, he was the oldest pitcher to accomplish this feat. Johnson had 13 strikeouts on his way to a 2\u20130 victory against the [[Atlanta Braves]]. The perfect game made him the fifth pitcher in Major League history (after [[Cy Young]], [[Jim Bunning]], [[Nolan Ryan]], and [[Hideo Nomo]]) to pitch a no-hitter in both leagues. He also became the fifth pitcher in Major League history to throw both a no-hitter and a perfect game in his career (after Young, Bunning, [[Addie Joss]], and [[Sandy Koufax]]; since Johnson, [[Mark Buehrle]] and [[Roy Halladay]] have joined this group). Johnson struck out [[Jeff Cirillo]] of the [[San Diego Padres]] on June 29, 2004 to become only the fourth MLB player to reach 4,000 strikeouts in a career.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Gilbert |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20040629&content_id=783948&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=null |title=Big Unit joins 4,000-strikeout club &#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nHe finished the 2004 season with a 16\u201314 record, though his poor record was partially due to a lack of run support as his ERA that year was 2.60. Johnson led the major leagues in strikeouts (with 290). In the games where Arizona scored three or more runs, Johnson was 13\u20132. As his team only won 51 games that year, his ratio of winning 31.3% of his team's games was the highest for any starting pitcher since [[Steve Carlton]] in 1972 (who won 27 of the [[Phillies]]' 59 wins for an all-time record ratio of 45.8%).\n\n===New York Yankees (2005\u20132006)===\n[[File:RandyJohnson.jpg|thumb|upright|Johnson with the Yankees]]\nThe Diamondbacks traded Johnson to the [[New York Yankees]] for [[Javier V\u00e1zquez (baseball)|Javier V\u00e1zquez]], [[Brad Halsey]], [[Dioner Navarro]], and cash in January 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1955906|title=Paperwork in place for Johnson-Vazquez trade \u2013 MLB|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}</ref> Johnson pitched Opening Day for the Yankees on April 3, 2005 against the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Johnson was inconsistent through 2005, allowing 32 home runs; however, he regained his dominance in late 2005. He was 5\u20130 against the Yankees' [[Yankees \u2013 Red Sox rivalry|division rival]] Red Sox and finished the season 17\u20138 with a 3.79 ERA, and was second in the AL with 211 strikeouts.\n\nIn 2005, ''[[The Sporting News]]'' published an update of their 1999 book ''Baseball's 100 Greatest Players''. Johnson did not make the original edition, but for the 2005 update, with his career totals considerably higher and his 2001 World Championship season taken into account, he was ranked at Number 60.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nJohnson was a disappointment in Game 3 of the 2005 [[Division Series]] against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], allowing 5 runs on 2 home runs in 3 innings. In Game 5 in Anaheim, Johnson made an effective relief appearance after [[Mike Mussina]] gave up 5 runs and 6 hits to give the Angels a 5\u20132 lead, but the Yankees were unable to come back in the series.\n\nAfter an inconclusive year in pinstripes, New York fans hoped that Johnson would return to his dominant style in his second Yankee season. Johnson began 2006 well, but then he struggled to find form. In between some impressive performances, he allowed 5 or more runs in 7 of his first 18 starts for the season. Johnson was more effective in the second half. Johnson finished the season with a 17\u201311 record, a subpar 5.00 ERA with 172 strikeouts. It was revealed at the end of the 2006 season that a herniated disc in Johnson's back had been stiffening him and it was only in his second to last start of the season that he decided to get it checked. This exposure caused him to miss his last start of 2006. After being given [[epidural anesthesia]] and a few bullpen sessions he was cleared to start in game 3 of the ALDS, however he gave up 5 runs in 5{{frac|2|3}} innings.\n\n===Second stint with the Arizona Diamondbacks (2007\u20132008)===\n[[File:Randy Johnson 04.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Johnson pitching for the Arizona Diamondbacks.]]\nIn January 2007, the Yankees traded Johnson back to the Diamondbacks, almost two years to the day that Arizona had traded him to New York, for a package of [[Luis Vizca\u00edno]], [[Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Steven Jackson (baseball)|Steven Jackson]], and [[Ross Ohlendorf]].<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/> The Yankees' decision to trade Johnson was primarily based on a pre-season conversation he had with Yankees General Manager [[Brian Cashman]] about the importance of being closer to his family in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] after the death of his brother.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kepner|first=Tyler|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/05/sports/baseball/05yanks.html | title=Yankees Send Johnson Back to Arizona |publisher=New York Times |date=January 5, 2007 |accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJohnson missed most of April, rehabilitating his injured back before returning on April 24, 2007. Johnson allowed six runs in 5 innings and took the loss, but struck out seven. He returned to form, and by his tenth start of the season was among the NL's top ten strikeout pitchers. But on July 3, his surgically repaired disc from the previous season was reinjured. Johnson had season-ending surgery on the same disc, this time removing it completely. Reporting that the procedure went \"a little better than expected\", Arizona hoped that Johnson would be ready for the 2008 season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Associated |first=The |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-03-09-3753914909_x.htm |title=Hideki Matsui returns to Yankees' lineup; Randy Johnson ready for spring debut |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=March 9, 2008 |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nJohnson made his season debut on April 14, 2008 against the [[San Francisco Giants]] at [[AT&T Park]] eight months following his back surgery.

The program enjoyed success under head coach [[Nancy Wilson (basketball)|Nancy Wilson]] during the 1980s in the [[Metro Conference]], when it won five regular season conference championships and three conference tournament championships. Under current head coach [[Dawn Staley]], the Gamecocks have been one of the top programs in the country, winning the [[2017 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|National Championship]] in [[2016\u201317 South Carolina Gamecocks women's basketball team|2017]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe Gamecocks first competed at an intercollegiate level in women's basketball in 1923, when they were called the '''Pullets'''.\n\nThe modern era of South Carolina women's basketball began when the '''Carolina Chicks''' took to the court in January 1974 under the guidance of [[Pam Backhaus]]. The inaugural team compiled a record of 15\u20137 and were the South Carolina [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women|AIAW]] champions. In 1977, with Pam Parsons as the head coach the women's basketball team, they changed their nickname to the '''Lady Gamecocks''' and made post-season trips every year during her four-year tenure.\n\nDuring its eight seasons in the Metro Conference, the Lady Gamecocks won the regular season championship five times and the conference tournament three times.<ref>{{cite web|title=''South Carolina Women's Basketball History''|url=http://gamecocksonline.cstv.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/041802aaj.html}}</ref>\n\nWhen South Carolina joined the SEC, success was hard to come by during their first decade in one of the strongest conferences in women's basketball. They initially struggled to compete under head coaches Nancy Wilson and [[Susan Walvius]]. Walvius' teams in 2001\u201302 and 2002\u201303 broke through to finish 25\u20137 and 23\u20138, respectively, earning trips to the NCAA tournament and reaching the Elite Eight in 2002.\n\nWalvius resigned after the 2007\u201308 season. On May 7, 2008, [[Dawn Staley]] was named the new head coach of the team now known as simply the \"Gamecocks\".\n\nUnder coach Staley, the Gamecocks improved or equaled their win total every season during her first seven years leading the program, culminating in a 34\u20133 record in 2014\u201315. That year they won the SEC regular season championship, the SEC Tournament championship and the NCAA East Region Championship. The season ended in the NCAA Final Four with a last second one-point loss to Notre Dame in the national semifinals.\n\nThe following year, the Gamecocks went undefeated in conference play, only to be stymied in the Sweet 16 by Syracuse. In 2016\u201317, the Gamecocks garnered their third straight sweep of the SEC regular season and tournament titles en route to their second Final Four.

The program enjoyed success under head coach [[Nancy Wilson (basketball)|Nancy Wilson]] during the 1980s in the [[Metro Conference]], when it won five regular season conference championships and three conference tournament championships. Under current head coach [[Dawn Staley]], the Gamecocks have been one of the top programs in the country, winning the [[2017 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Division I national championship]] in [[2016\u201317 South Carolina Gamecocks women's basketball team|2017]].\n\n\n==History==\n\nThe Gamecocks first competed at an intercollegiate level in women's basketball in 1923, when they were called the '''Pullets'''.\n\nThe modern era of South Carolina women's basketball began when the '''Carolina Chicks''' took to the court in January 1974 under the guidance of [[Pam Backhaus]]. The inaugural team compiled a record of 15\u20137 and were the South Carolina [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women|AIAW]] champions. In 1977, with Pam Parsons as the head coach the women's basketball team, they changed their nickname to the '''Lady Gamecocks''' and made post-season trips every year during her four-year tenure.\n\nDuring its eight seasons in the Metro Conference, the Lady Gamecocks won the regular season championship five times and the conference tournament three times.<ref>{{cite web|title=''South Carolina Women's Basketball History''|url=http://gamecocksonline.cstv.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/041802aaj.html}}</ref>\n\nWhen South Carolina joined the SEC, success was hard to come by during their first decade in one of the strongest conferences in women's basketball. They initially struggled to compete under head coaches Nancy Wilson and [[Susan Walvius]]. Walvius' teams in 2001\u201302 and 2002\u201303 broke through to finish 25\u20137 and 23\u20138, respectively, earning trips to the NCAA tournament and reaching the Elite Eight in 2002.\n\nWalvius resigned after the 2007\u201308 season. On May 7, 2008, [[Dawn Staley]] was named the new head coach of the team now known as simply the \"Gamecocks\".\n\nUnder coach Staley, the Gamecocks improved or equaled their win total every season during her first seven years leading the program, culminating in a 34\u20133 record in 2014\u201315. That year they won the SEC regular season championship, the SEC Tournament championship and the NCAA East Region Championship. The season ended in the NCAA Final Four with a last second one-point loss to Notre Dame in the national semifinals.\n\nThe following year, the Gamecocks went undefeated in conference play, only to be stymied in the Sweet 16 by Syracuse. In 2016\u201317, the Gamecocks garnered their third straight sweep of the SEC regular season and tournament titles en route to their second Final Four. They defeated conference rival Mississippi State in the national championship game to win their first-ever national title.\n\nIn the 2018 SEC tournament, the Gamecocks defeated Mississippi State to win the SEC tournament, South Carolina is the only team to win the SEC tournament for four straight years. Their season came to an end when they were defeated by Connecticut in the Elite Eight.\n\nIn 2020, South Carolina finished 32\u20131 (16\u20130), led by the #1 ranked recruiting class and senior leadership of point guard Tyasha Harris. The Gamecocks defeated 14 ranked teams including their first-ever victory over [[UConn Huskies women's basketball|UConn]], and won both the SEC regular season and tournament titles. South Carolina won their final 26 games of the season and spent the final nine weeks as the AP #1 ranked team. Dawn Staley was named national coach of the year, and Aliyah Boston was named national freshman of the year, and SEC defensive player of the year. The Gamecocks occupied the No. 1 spots in the AP and coaches' polls when the [[2020 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament]] was canceled due to concerns over the [[COVID-19]] pandemic.\n\n==Head coaches==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!

He was the partner of established character [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]), and a father-figure to her four children. Tony [[child molestation|sexually abused]] Bianca's stepdaughter, [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), and began [[child grooming|grooming]] her school-friend [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Madeline Duggan]]), before his predatory nature was uncovered and he was arrested for his crimes. Tony appeared between 12 September and 12 December 2008 and returned in December 2009 to stand trial.\n\nThe child sexual abuse storyline marked the first time the subject matter had been broached in a UK soap opera, and was researched and developed with advice and approval from the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]]. The abusive nature of Tony and Whitney's relationship resulted in over 200 complaints being made to the BBC and television regulatory body [[Ofcom]] by members of the public,<ref name=\"Guardiancomp\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/18/bbc.television|title=EastEnders paedophile storyline draws 200 complaints|first=Leigh|last=Holmwood|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=18 September 2008|accessdate=6 November 2008}}</ref> with the storyline deemed \"one of the darkest and most disturbing storylines ''EastEnders'' has ever attempted\" by ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Beth Neil.<ref name=\"darkest\" /> The NSPCC however praised the storyline for \"helping to raise awareness of the hidden nature of sexual abuse\".<ref name=\"nspcc\" /> The storyline also gained ''EastEnders'' a [[Royal Television Society]] Programme Award in March 2009 in the Soap and Continuing Drama category.\n\n==Storylines==\n[[File:Patsy Palmer.jpg|thumb|[[Patsy Palmer]] plays Bianca, Tony's partner and the adoptive mother of his victim [[Whitney Dean]].]]\n\nAfter being released from prison for assaulting a teenage boy who propositioned [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]), Tony joins his partner [[Bianca Butcher]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) and her family in [[Walford]], including her son [[Morgan Jackson-King]], whom he has adopted. It is revealed that he is a [[paedophile]] who has been [[Child grooming|grooming]] and sexually abusing Whitney, Bianca's adopted daughter, since she was 12. He immediately resumes his sexual relationship with Whitney, despite his displeasure at her more adult appearance, insisting she remove her make-up and jewellery. When Whitney gets a role in the school play, Tony is angry about having less time with her, becoming jealous of her co-star [[Peter Beale]] ([[Thomas Law]]). Tony deceives Whitney into believing they will run away and start a new life together when she turns sixteen. Whitney gives him money she has been keeping for his return, which he gives Bianca as a deposit for a flat. Tony assaults Peter as a result of his growing jealousy, and is nearly reported to the police by Peter's sister [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Melissa Suffield]]). Whitney convinces Lucy not to go to the police, but not before Lucy tells Bianca what happened. When Bianca angrily tells Tony that she is not a child anymore, he realizes he is no longer attracted to her.\n\nTony begins grooming fourteen-year-old Lauren Branning, supporting her when her mother [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) is arrested for the attempted murder of her father. He plans to take her to a concert, but Lauren's father [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) uncovers her hidden clothes and refuses her permission to attend. When Whitney's sixteenth birthday arrives, she books flights so they can run away together. Attempting to foil her plan, Tony steals her passport but it is found and returned. On her birthday, Whitney tells Bianca about her relationship with Tony, believing that they are going to leave together. Horrified, Bianca calls the police, and Tony is arrested. He is later released on bail and visits their home in an attempt to convince Whitney not to give a statement to the police. He is attacked by Bianca's ex-husband [[Ricky Butcher|Ricky]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and re-arrested for breaking his bail conditions.\n\nBefore his trial, Tony attempts suicide. Whitney tries to visit but is refused, and Bianca sees it as a form of manipulation. Tony repeatedly attempts to contact Whitney by phone, but after the first day of the trial, he flushes the [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]] down the toilet in his cell. When Whitney's brother [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]) tries to attack Tony in court, Whitney says she will refuse to testify, claiming her witness statement was a lie and she was forced to say it. Bianca explains to Whitney that Tony will be set free and that he will target other children. Tony's barrister, [[List of EastEnders characters (2009)#Mrs Taylor|Mrs Taylor]] ([[Jacqueline Defferary]]), cross-examines Whitney, trying to imply that she pursued him for several years, saying she refused to take 'no' for an answer and lied about the accusations. Tony shouts out that he is innocent but Whitney says she trusted him and he abused her, revealing the truth about the relationship. After leaving the courtroom, Whitney gives her barrister, [[Vivien Easley|Vivien Easley QC]] (Geraldine Alexander), a mobile phone with messages from Tony on it. A week later Tony is found guilty of all charges and sentenced to 13 years in custody. He smirks as the verdict is being read out but is taken away with his head in his hands.\n\nOver three years later, Whitney receives a note from Tony via one of his former prison friends, saying that he always loved her. Whitney attempts to visit Tony in prison, but she is told that he killed himself in his cell.\n\n==Creation==\nTony was first mentioned in ''EastEnders'' in April 2008, when Palmer returned as Bianca Jackson following a nine-year absence from the show. It was established that although Tony was currently in prison, he and Bianca were in a relationship, and that he acted as a father-figure to her children Whitney Dean, [[Liam Butcher]] ([[James Forde]]) and [[Tiffany Dean]] ([[Maisie Smith]]). It was originally stated that Tony was the biological father of Bianca's youngest son, [[multiracial|mixed-race]] [[Morgan Jackson-King]] (Devon Higgs), which raised confusion with viewers when it was later announced that Coghill, who is white, had been cast in the role. The show's producers explained that Tony was not really Morgan's father, and that the reason behind this deception would be revealed soon after his arrival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a107432/eastenders-morgan-whos-the-daddy.html|title='EastEnders' Morgan: Who's the Daddy?|first=Kris|last=Green|date=4 July 2008|website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=29 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Tony did not appear in the show until September 2008, his arrival was anticipated from April of that year, when ''EastEnders'' executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] commented that the series was building a picture of his character, and that it would be interesting to see him on-screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/interviews/a94856/diederick-santer-executive-producer-eastenders.html|title=Diederick Santer (Executive Producer, 'EastEnders')|first=Kris|last=Green|website=[[Digital Spy]]|date=29 April 2008|accessdate=29 October 2009}}</ref> It was reported on 2 July 2008 that Tony would be arriving in the serial as part of a [[child sexual abuse]] storyline involving Whitney.<ref name=\"arrival\"/> [[BBC News]] described the plot as an ongoing \"predatory paedophile storyline\", noting that this was the first time this subject matter had been tackled by a UK soap opera.<ref name=\"beeb\">{{cite news|work=[[BBC Online]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7613307.stm|title=Will sex offender pilots work?|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|date=15 September 2008|accessdate=15 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote_box |width=40% |align=left|quote=\"Programmes like ''EastEnders'' are increasingly helping to raise awareness of the hidden nature of [[sexual abuse]].

Ashdown questioned what might happen if a child sex offender were to befriend the mother in order to grow closer to the child, and related the scenario to Bianca's return to the soap.<ref name=\"Guardian\" /> BBC Head of Drama [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]] explained that the idea when presented \"drew a sharp intake of breath. Most ''EastEnders'' stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\" /> Final approval for the storyline was sought from BBC Head of Fiction [[Jane Tranter]] on 2 June 2008.<ref name=\"Guardian\" /> Tranter explained that: \"I thought it was a fantastically good idea. The big moments in ''EastEnders'', those iconic pieces of television history, tend to be the things that are incredibly near the knuckle, and are actually quite difficult subjects to raise in the context of a family sitting room.

It is revealed that he is a [[paedophile]] who has been [[Child grooming|grooming]] and sexually abusing Whitney, Bianca's adopted daughter, since she was 12. He immediately resumes his sexual relationship with Whitney, despite his displeasure at her more adult appearance, insisting she remove her make-up and jewellery. When Whitney gets a role in the school play, Tony is angry about having less time with her, becoming jealous of her co-star [[Peter Beale]] ([[Thomas Law]]). Tony deceives Whitney into believing they will run away and start a new life together when she turns sixteen. Whitney gives him money she has been keeping for his return, which he gives Bianca as a deposit for a flat. Tony assaults Peter as a result of his growing jealousy, and is nearly reported to the police by Peter's sister [[Lucy Beale]] ([[Melissa Suffield]]). Whitney convinces Lucy not to go to the police, but not before Lucy tells Bianca what happened. When Bianca angrily tells Tony that she is not a child anymore, he realizes he is no longer attracted to her.\n\nTony begins grooming fourteen-year-old Lauren Branning, supporting her when her mother [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) is arrested for the attempted murder of her father. He plans to take her to a concert, but Lauren's father [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) uncovers her hidden clothes and refuses her permission to attend. When Whitney's sixteenth birthday arrives, she books flights so they can run away together. Attempting to foil her plan, Tony steals her passport but it is found and returned. On her birthday, Whitney tells Bianca about her relationship with Tony, believing that they are going to leave together. Horrified, Bianca calls the police, and Tony is arrested. He is later released on bail and visits their home in an attempt to convince Whitney not to give a statement to the police. He is attacked by Bianca's ex-husband [[Ricky Butcher|Ricky]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and re-arrested for breaking his bail conditions.\n\nBefore his trial, Tony attempts suicide. Whitney tries to visit but is refused, and Bianca sees it as a form of manipulation. Tony repeatedly attempts to contact Whitney by phone, but after the first day of the trial, he flushes the [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]] down the toilet in his cell. When Whitney's brother [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]) tries to attack Tony in court, Whitney says she will refuse to testify, claiming her witness statement was a lie and she was forced to say it. Bianca explains to Whitney that Tony will be set free and that he will target other children. Tony's barrister, [[List of EastEnders characters (2009)#Mrs Taylor|Mrs Taylor]] ([[Jacqueline Defferary]]), cross-examines Whitney, trying to imply that she pursued him for several years, saying she refused to take 'no' for an answer and lied about the accusations. Tony shouts out that he is innocent but Whitney says she trusted him and he abused her, revealing the truth about the relationship. After leaving the courtroom, Whitney gives her barrister, [[Vivien Easley|Vivien Easley QC]] (Geraldine Alexander), a mobile phone with messages from Tony on it. A week later Tony is found guilty of all charges and sentenced to 13 years in custody. He smirks as the verdict is being read out but is taken away with his head in his hands.\n\nOver three years later, Whitney receives a note from Tony via one of his former prison friends, saying that he always loved her. Whitney attempts to visit Tony in prison, but she is told that he killed himself in his cell.\n\n==Creation==\nTony was first mentioned in ''EastEnders'' in April 2008, when Palmer returned as Bianca Jackson following a nine-year absence from the show. It was established that although Tony was currently in prison, he and Bianca were in a relationship, and that he acted as a father-figure to her children Whitney Dean, [[Liam Butcher]] ([[James Forde]]) and [[Tiffany Dean]] ([[Maisie Smith]]). It was originally stated that Tony was the biological father of Bianca's youngest son, [[multiracial|mixed-race]] [[Morgan Jackson-King]] (Devon Higgs), which raised confusion with viewers when it was later announced that Coghill, who is white, had been cast in the role. The show's producers explained that Tony was not really Morgan's father, and that the reason behind this deception would be revealed soon after his arrival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a107432/eastenders-morgan-whos-the-daddy.html|title='EastEnders' Morgan: Who's the Daddy?|first=Kris|last=Green|date=4 July 2008|website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=29 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Tony did not appear in the show until September 2008, his arrival was anticipated from April of that year, when ''EastEnders'' executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] commented that the series was building a picture of his character, and that it would be interesting to see him on-screen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/interviews/a94856/diederick-santer-executive-producer-eastenders.html|title=Diederick Santer (Executive Producer, 'EastEnders')|first=Kris|last=Green|website=[[Digital Spy]]|date=29 April 2008|accessdate=29 October 2009}}</ref> It was reported on 2 July 2008 that Tony would be arriving in the serial as part of a [[child sexual abuse]] storyline involving Whitney.<ref name=\"arrival\"/> [[BBC News]] described the plot as an ongoing \"predatory paedophile storyline\", noting that this was the first time this subject matter had been tackled by a UK soap opera.<ref name=\"beeb\">{{cite news|work=[[BBC Online]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7613307.stm|title=Will sex offender pilots work?|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|date=15 September 2008|accessdate=15 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote_box |width=40% |align=left|quote=\"Programmes like ''EastEnders'' are increasingly helping to raise awareness of the hidden nature of [[sexual abuse]].

In a small sheriff's office, the deputies are supervised directly by the sheriff. Large sheriffs offices have several ranks in a similar manner to a police department. The  [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] has thousands of regular deputies, who are 8 ranks below the sheriff. The actual second-in-command of the sheriff typically holds the title of [[chief deputy]] or [[undersheriff]]. In some counties, the undersheriff is the [[Prison warden|warden]] of the [[Prison|county jail]].\n\n===Election===\nOf the 50 [[U.S. state]]s, 48 have sheriffs. The two exceptions are [[Alaska]], which [[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|does not have counties]], and [[Connecticut]], which [[List of counties in Connecticut|has no county governments]]. [[Washington, D.C.|The federal district]] and the 5 [[Territories of the United States|populated territories]] also do not have county governments.\n\nSheriffs are elected to four-year terms in 42&nbsp;states, two-year terms in [[Arkansas]] and [[New Hampshire]], three-year terms in [[New Jersey]], and six-year terms in [[Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web |title=OFFICE OF SHERIFF STATE-BY-STATE ELECTIONS INFORMATION | date=27 September 2012 |publisher=National Sheriffs' Association |url=http://www.sheriffs.org/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/Office%20of%20Sheriff%20State-by-State%20Election%20Chart%20updated%202012_0.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019085635/http://www.sheriffs.org/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/Office%20of%20Sheriff%20State-by-State%20Election%20Chart%20updated%202012_0.pdf |archive-date=19 October 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Sheriffs are appointed instead of elected in [[Hawaii]], [[Rhode Island]] and a small number of counties elsewhere.\n\nIn many rural areas of the United States, particularly in the [[Southern United States|South]] and [[Western United States|West]], the sheriff has traditionally been viewed as one of a given county's most influential political office-holders.\n\n==Duties==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nThe role of a sheriff's office varies considerably from state to state and even from county to county. Sheriffs and their deputies (in all states except Delaware, where the sheriff's defined role is going through arbitration) tend to be sworn peace officers with the power to make arrests and serve before a magistrate or judge, serve warrants for arrest or order for arrest, and give a ticket/citation. Some states extend this authority to adjacent counties or to the entire state. In a small sheriff's office, the sheriff is likely to carry out law enforcement duties just like a regular deputy or police officer. In medium-sized or large sheriff's office, this is rare.\n\nMany sheriff's offices also perform other functions such as traffic control, animal enforcement, accident investigations, homicide investigation, narcotics investigation, transportation of prisoners, school resource officers, and courthouse security. Larger departments may perform other criminal investigations or engage in other specialized law enforcement activities. Some larger sheriff's departments may have [[aviation]] (including fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters), motorcycle units, [[Police dog|K9 units]], [[SWAT|tactical units]], mounted details, or water patrols at their disposal.\n\nIn some areas of the country, such as in California's [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino]], [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]], [[Orange County, California|Orange]], [[Sierra County, California|Sierra]], [[Tulare County, California|Tulare]] and [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]] counties, the sheriff's office also has the responsibility of a [[coroner]]'s office, and is charged with recovering deceased persons within their county and conducting [[Autopsy|autopsies]]. The official in charge of such sheriff's departments is typically titled sheriff-coroner or sheriff/coroner, and officers who perform this function for such departments are typically titled deputy sheriff-coroner or deputy coroner.\n\nMany sheriff's departments enlist the aid of local neighborhoods, using a [[community policing]] strategy, in working to prevent crime. The National Neighborhood Watch Program, sponsored by the National Sheriffs' Association, allows civilians and law enforcement officers to cooperate in keeping communities safe.\n\nAs the trends of sheriff's law enforcement duties becoming more extensive and complex continues, new career opportunities for people with specialized skills are opening up in sheriff's offices around the country. Among the specialties now in demand are underwater diving, piloting, boating, snow skiing, radar technology, communications, computer technology, accounting, emergency medicine, and foreign languages.\n\nSheriff's offices may coexist with other county level law enforcement agencies such as [[county police]], county park police, etc.\n\n==Sheriff's categories==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nSheriffs in the United States generally fall into three broad categories:\n\n*Restricted service \u2013 provide basic court related services such as keeping the [[Prison|county jail]], transporting [[prison]]ers, providing [[courthouse]] security and other duties with regard to [[service of process]] and [[summons]]es that are issued by county and state [[court]]s. The sheriff also often conducts [[public auction]] sales of [[real property]] in [[foreclosure]] in many jurisdictions, and is often also empowered to conduct seizures of [[Personal property|chattel]] property to satisfy a [[Judgment (law)|judgment]]. In other jurisdictions, these civil process duties are performed by other officers, such as a [[marshal]] or [[constable]]. An example is the [[Philadelphia Sheriff's Office]] in Pennsylvania.\n*Limited service \u2013 along with the above, perform some type of traditional law-enforcement function such as investigations and patrol. This may be limited to [[security police]] duties on county properties (and others by contract) to the performance of these duties in unincorporated areas of the county, and some incorporated areas by contract. \n*Full service \u2013 The most common type, provide all traditional law-enforcement functions, including countywide patrol and investigations irrespective of municipal boundaries.\n\nNote: There are two federal equivalents of the sheriff; the first is the [[United States Marshals Service]], an agency of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]. There are 94 United States Marshals, one for each federal judicial district. The U.S. Marshal and his or her Deputy Marshals are responsible for the transport of prisoners and security for the [[United States district court]]s, and also issue and enforce certain civil processes.\n\nThe other is the [[Marshal of the United States Supreme Court]] who performs all court related duties for the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].\n\n==Sheriff types by state==\n\n===Alabama===\nIn Alabama, a sheriff is an elected official and the chief law enforcement officer in any given county. There is one sheriff for each of [[List of counties in Alabama|Alabama's 67 counties]], with a varying number of deputies and various staff members (usually dependent on the population). A sheriff's office generally provides law-enforcement services to unincorporated towns and cities within the boundaries of the counties.\n\n===Alaska===\nThe office of sheriff does not exist in Alaska by the State's Constitution. Instead the functions that would be performed by lower-48 sheriffs and their deputies (such as civil process, court security, and prisoner transport) are performed by [[Alaska State Troopers]] and Alaska DPS Judicial Services Officers, who are the equivalent of \"bailiffs\" in lower-48 jurisdictions. AJS officers wear uniforms similar to troopers and staff district court facilities statewide but not magistrate's courts. Their peace officer status is limited to courthouses and when transporting prisoners in custody. Additionally, with no county jails, Alaska Dept. Of Corrections runs regional prisons which have separate male and female inmate  \"pretrial wings\", which keep pretrial inmates who are legally innocent, separate from convicted prisoners who are serving a court imposed sentence following a criminal conviction. Pretrial wing units are the AK equivalent of lower-48 county jails. This uniquely makes AK DOC officers both correctional officers and jailers. Pretrial units house persons charged who are formally charged with crimes and remanded to pretrial custody, vs. traditional prisons for persons convicted and sentenced to a term of incarceration.\n\n===Arizona===\n[[File:Captain Buckey O'Neill.png|thumb|right|William Owen Buckey O'Neill, Yuma Arizona Sheriff 1888]]\n\n[[File:Young Carl hayden-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Arizona Sheriff (later U.S. Senator) [[Carl Hayden]]]]\n\nIn Arizona, a sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer of one of the [[List of counties in Arizona|15 counties]] of the state, with a varying number of deputies and assorted staff (usually dependent on population).

In addition, many sheriff's offices have agreements with the [[Arizona Department of Corrections]] (ADC) and local police agencies to provide for the transport and detention of prisoners. After sentencing, many convicted persons are remanded over to the ADC to serve their sentence, but this has not always been the case.\n\nArizona is unique in that many sheriff's offices have formed semi-permanent [[Posse comitatus|posse]] units which can be operated as a reserve to the main deputized force under a variety of circumstances, as opposed to solely for fugitive retrieval as is historically associated with the term.<ref>{{cite web|title=A.R.S. \u00a711-441(8)(D)|url=https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/11/00441.htm|website=Arizona State Legislature|accessdate=23 March 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428185301/https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.azleg.gov%2Fars%2F11%2F00441.htm|archivedate=28 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Maricopa County Sheriff's Office]] (MCSO) is the largest sheriff's office in Arizona and the third-largest in the United States, with a total of 575 sworn officers and 2,735 civilian and detention employees {{as of|2017|lc=y}}. MCSO is headed by Sheriff [[Paul Penzone]].\n\n===Arkansas===\n\n[[File:Arkansas 2012-03-18 013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Phillips County, Arkansas]] [[Police car|sheriff cruiser]]]]\n\nIn Arkansas, sheriffs and their deputies are fully empowered peace officers with county-wide jurisdiction and thus, may legally exercise their authority in unincorporated and incorporated areas of a county.   Under state law, sheriffs and their deputies, as well as all other law enforcement and peace officers, are \"on-duty\" 24 hours a day, meaning they can make arrests with or without a warrant (provided the warrant-less arrest is a result of a violation of law committed in their presence or view).\n\nThe duties of an Arkansas sheriff generally include providing law enforcement services to residents, managing county jail(s), and providing bailiffs for the county, district, circuit, and other courts within the county. By Arkansas Law, the Sheriff is the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the County.  There are 75 county sheriffs in Arkansas, one for each county, regardless of its population size.\n\nWith very limited exceptions, sheriffs and their deputies may exercise their official authority only within the geographical boundaries of their specific county.\n\nThe office of sheriff was created by the state constitution and the office has not been substantially changed in 100 years.\n\nSheriffs in Arkansas are elected in even numbered years by citizens of their county to serve a term of four years in office in accordance with the state constitution. Sheriffs rely upon the county's legislative body, known as the \"[[Commissioners' court|Quorum Court]]\", to appropriate funding and approve the yearly operating budget. However, in all other circumstances, the sheriff is entirely independent in the management of his elected office and is not subservient to or accountable to any other elected county official or body.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nUnder Arkansas law, a sheriff cannot campaign for reelection while wearing a county owned badge.\n\n===California===\nIn [[California]], a sheriff is an elected official and the chief law enforcement officer in any given county. The sheriff's department of each county polices [[unincorporated area]]s (areas of the county that do not lie within the jurisdiction of a police department of an incorporated municipality). As such, the sheriff and his or her deputies in rural areas and unincorporated municipalities are equivalent to police officers in the cities. The sheriff's department may also provide policing services to incorporated cities by contract (see [[contract city]]). Sheriff's departments in California are also responsible for enforcing criminal law on Native American tribal land, as prescribed by [[Public Law 280]], which was enacted in 1953. The law transferred the responsibility of criminal law enforcement on tribal land from the federal government to state governments in specified states.\n\nAll [[Law enforcement officer|peace officers]] in California are able to exercise their police powers anywhere in the state, on or off duty, regardless of county or municipal boundaries, thus California sheriffs and their deputies have full police powers in incorporated and unincorporated municipalities, outside their own counties, and on state freeways and interstates.\n\nBefore 2000, there was a [[constable]] or [[marshal]] in most (but not all) of California's 58 counties. The constable or marshal was responsible for providing [[bailiff]]s to the Municipal and Justice Courts and for serving [[Service of process|criminal and civil process]]. During a reorganization of the state judicial system early in the first decade of the 21st century, the roles of constable, marshal, and sheriff were merged, so that California sheriffs assumed the duties of most marshals, and the position of constable was eliminated entirely. The marshals offices continued to exist in only three counties\u2014[[Shasta County, California|Shasta]], [[Trinity County, California|Trinity]], and [[San Benito County, California|San Benito]]\u2014where they perform all court-security and warrant-service functions.\n\n====Los Angeles County====\nThe [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] (LASD) serves [[Los Angeles County, California]]. With over 18,000 employees, it is the largest Sheriff's department in the United States and provides general-service law enforcement to unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County, serving as the equivalent of the city police for unincorporated areas of the county as well as incorporated cities within the county who have contracted with the agency for law-enforcement services (known as \"contract cities\" in local jargon). It also holds primary jurisdiction over facilities operated by Los Angeles County, such as local parks, marinas and government buildings; provides [[marshal]] service for the [[California superior courts|Superior Court of California]], [[Los Angeles County, California|County of Los Angeles]]; operates the [[Prison|county jail]] system; and provides services such as laboratories and academy training to smaller law enforcement agencies within the county.\n\n====San Francisco====\n{{Main|San Francisco Sheriff's Department}}\nBecause the [[San Francisco|City and County of San Francisco]] are [[Consolidated city-county|consolidated and coterminous]]\u2014the only consolidated city and county in California\u2014the San Francisco Sheriff historically possessed law enforcement authority. However, as the [[San Francisco Police Department]] provides general police service for the city, the Sheriff's Department handles judicial duties, staffs the jail, and provides law enforcement services for city facilities such as [[San Francisco City Hall]] and [[San Francisco General Hospital]]. San Francisco Sheriff's deputies back up the San Francisco Police as needed, as well as make arrests for criminal and vehicle-code violations while performing their duties.\n\n===Colorado===\n\nThe Denver Sheriff Department maintains the county correctional facilities as well as court functions. Law enforcement and investigations are the responsibility of the [[Denver Police Department]]. Denver's sheriff is appointed by the mayor, and serves as the sworn head of the sheriff department. Denver has had deputy sheriffs since the creation of the City & County of Denver in 1902, however the Denver Sheriff Department current organization was not established until 1969, consolidating all of the sheriff's functions under one management structure.\n\nThe Denver Sheriff is, along with [[Broomfield, Colorado|Broomfield's]], an anomaly within the state. In every other county, the Sheriff is an elected official and is the chief law enforcement officer of his county.\n\n===Connecticut===\nConnecticut abolished county sheriffs in 2000 by Public Act 00-01. All civil-process-serving deputies were sworn in as state marshals, and criminal special deputies were sworn in as judicial marshals. Constables remain municipal officers governed by their respective town or city. A few towns have local sheriffs that primarily perform process serving duties and may act as a [[Serjeant-at-arms|sergeant at arms]] for town meetings.\n\nPrior to the abolition of county sheriffs in 2000, duties of sheriffs in Connecticut were limited to process serving, court bailiffs, and executing search and arrest warrants. Other law enforcement duties, such as emergency response, highway patrol and traffic enforcement, and maintaining public order were left to municipal police departments or constables or the Connecticut State Police in places where no local police agency exists.\n\n===Delaware===\nThe first [[Constitution of Delaware]] in 1776 made the sheriff a [[conservator of the peace]] within the county in which he resides, either [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]], [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent]], or [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex]]. The sheriff was, and still is, chosen by the citizens of each county at the general elections to serve a four-year term. Per Title 10, Chapter 21 of the Delaware Code, the Sheriff is an officer of the court. Responsibilities include processing orders of the court system; summoning inquests, jurors, and witnesses for the courts; and, conducting execution sales against personal and real estate property. County Sheriffs and their regular appointed deputies also take into custody unincarcerated persons immediately upon conviction of an imprisonable offense and convey them to the appropriate correctional facility to serve their terms. The County Sheriffs and their deputies do not engage in typical law enforcement; their primary role is to provide enforcement services for the courts. Typical law enforcement, such as the enforcement of motor vehicle laws, investigation of crimes and routine policing patrols are performed by state, county, and municipal (town or city) police forces.<ref>[http://delcode.delaware.gov/title10/c021/index.shtml Title 10, Chapter 21, Delaware Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217193216/http://delcode.delaware.gov/title10/c021/index.shtml |date=2007-12-17 }} delaware.gov</ref>\n\n===District of Columbia===\nThere is no appointed or elected Sheriff in the District of Columbia because, as a [[Federal city|Federal City]], it is in a unique and complicated position compared to other jurisdictions in the United States. As the District Government is both an agency of the Federal Government and a duly-elected Local Government under the [[District of Columbia home rule|D.C. Home Rule Act of 1973]], there are many functions which would normally be reserved for the Office of the Sheriff, which are instead delegated to various other agencies. The [[United States Marshals Service|United States Marshal Service]], as an agent of the Federal Government officially handles most court and civil processes in the District of Columbia, while the [[District of Columbia Protective Services Division|District of Columbia Protective Services Police Department]] (PSPD) handles many other functions normally reserved for the Office of the Sheriff on behalf of the elected local government.\n\n===Florida===\n{{main|County sheriff (Florida)}}\n[[Florida]] sheriffs are one of a handful of \"constitutional\" Florida offices; that is, the position was established as part of the Florida State constitution, which specifies their powers and that they be elected in the general ballot. {{citation needed span|date=June 2019|text=They serve as the chief law enforcement officer in their respective counties.}} The sheriff's office is responsible for law enforcement, corrections, and court services within the county. Although each county sheriff's office is an independent agency, they all wear the \"Florida's sheriff green\" uniform with similar badges and patches, and drive vehicles with green and gold designs, as prescribed in Florida State Statutes, with the exception of Duval and Miami-Dade.\nCollier County also does not wear green; they wear a grey uniform with green accents.\n\n====Miami-Dade County====\n[[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] (formerly Dade County) has two directors appointed by its county commission. In Miami-Dade County, the duties of the two appointed directors are split as follows:\n*One director is simultaneously the metropolitan director and the director of public safety. As the director of public safety he/she serves as the chief of the [[Miami-Dade Police Department]] (separate from the [[Miami Police Department|City of Miami Police Department]]).\n*The other director serves in command of corrections (of the [http://www.miamidade.gov/corrections/ Miami-Dade Department of Corrections]) and is charged with the care and custody of prisoners.\n\n====Duval County====\nUpon the [[Consolidated city-county|consolidation]] of [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]] and the [[Jacksonville, Florida|City of Jacksonville]] governments in 1968, the Duval County Sheriff's Department and the Jacksonville Police Department were merged into a single unified law enforcement agency styled the [[Jacksonville Sheriff's Office]] (JSO). Commanded by the elected Sheriff of Duval County, and an appointed senior staff, its 1675 sworn members are referred to as \"police officers\" rather than deputies. All JSO police officers are also deputy sheriffs, in order to perform those duties Florida solely permits \"sheriffs and their deputies\" to perform, such as serving warrants. Similarly, the 800 members of the JSO's Department of Corrections are \"Correctional Officers\". [http://www.jaxsheriff.org/departments/sheriffs-office/sheriff-mike-williams.aspx Michael Williams] is the current Sheriff.\n\nJSO police and corrections uniforms are dark navy blue, with silver devices for police and corrections officers and gold for supervisory and command personnel. Marked JSO vehicles are white with a broad gold stripe on each side with the word \"SHERIFF\" displayed in navy blue on each rear quarter-panel and \"POLICE\" in navy blue on the rear of the vehicle. In 2007, in terms of sworn officers, JSO was the 25th largest local police agency in the US, and the second largest in the state of Florida.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/lpd07.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117113039/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/lpd07.pdf |archivedate=2013-01-17 }}</ref>\n\n====Broward County====\nThe [[Broward County Sheriff's Office|Broward Sheriff's Office]] is currently under the direction of Sheriff [[Gregory Tony]] and is a full-service law enforcement agency. The sheriff has an undersheriff and several district chiefs, also called district commanders. These individuals generally hold the title of \"captain.\" The Broward Sheriff's Office (BSO) also directs and oversees the fire/rescue/EMS operations for the county, referred to Broward County Fire Rescue (BSO or County Fire Rescue). Overseeing the operation of the Fire/Rescue/EMS Division is a fire chief and several deputy chiefs. BSO Fire Rescue serves unincorporated parts of the county as well as municipalities under contract for fire/rescue/EMS. BSO also operates several helicopters that serve a dual purpose. Each helicopter is suited for law enforcement duties as well as medical evacuation (MEDEVAC); the helicopters are staffed both by sworn deputies as well as a flight nurse or flight medic. BSO also has a professional Marine Patrol, motor (cycle) patrol and mounted (horse) patrol. The Broward Sheriff's office also contracts its law enforcement duties to municipalities that either have no local police department or have disbanded the local police department to be incorporated to BSO.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheriff.org|title=Home - Broward Sheriff's Office|website=www.sheriff.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928183146/http://sheriff.org/|archivedate=28 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Georgia===\nSheriffs and his or her deputies and any other state certified peace officer may make an arrest on or off duty only after stating that they are peace officers in the state of Georgia. One of five county officials listed in the state constitution, sheriffs in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] are full-service county officers. Article IX, Section I of the constitution specifies that sheriffs \"shall be elected by the qualified voters of their respective counties for a term of four years and shall have such qualifications, powers and duties as provided by general law.\" However, several metropolitan counties have opted to form a [[county police]] to perform law enforcement functions leaving the sheriff to court functions. Others also have a [[marshal|county marshal]] who provide civil law enforcement. Even with other agencies in the same county, such as county police, the Sheriff is the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of each county. All law enforcement officers in Georgia have statewide jurisdiction if the crime happens in their immediate presence, but sheriffs have statewide jurisdiction also if the crime originated in their county. This means if someone breaks the law in one county and flees to another the sheriff can go anywhere inside the state to investigate the crime, make the arrest, and transport the accused back to the original county.\n\nMost of the qualifications, powers and duties of a sheriff in Georgia are detailed in Title 15, Chapter 16 of state law. Among other things, the law states that \"the sheriff is the basic law enforcement officer of the several counties of this state.\" Section 10 makes it clear that the sheriff has as much authority within municipalities as he does in unincorporated areas of his county, although many sheriffs refrain from performing standard law-enforcement functions within municipalities that have their own police department unless specifically requested to do so, or are required to do so in order to fulfill other provisions in state law.\n\nIn addition to law enforcement, sheriffs or their deputies execute and return all processes and orders of the courts; receive, transport, and maintain custody of incarcerated individuals for court; attend the place or places of holding elections; keep all courthouses, jails, public grounds, and other county property; maintain a register of all precious-metal dealers; enforce the collection of taxes that may be due to the state; as well as numerous other duties.\n\nThe office of Sheriff in Georgia existed in colonial times, and was included in the first official constitution of Georgia in 1777. There is no limit to how many terms a sheriff may serve. Title 15, Chapter 16, Section 40 of Georgia law specifies that, upon reaching 75 years of age, a sheriff who has held that office for 45 or more years automatically holds the honorary office of sheriff emeritus of the State of Georgia.\n\nIn metropolitan counties the sheriff's responsibilities have changed from that of being the sole law enforcement official for their counties, to performing only traditional court-related functions but with wide-ranging duties in coordination with a county police department in the suburbs of the state capital and major cities. When these county police departments were formed they assumed patrol, investigative, crime fighting, and transportation safety responsibilities.\n\nThere are two Georgia counties where the police department in the county seat and the local sheriff's office have merged most of their general operations: the [[Macon-Bibb County Sheriffs Office]] and the Augusta-Richmond County Sheriff's Office.\n\n===Hawaii===\nHawaii has two sheriffs:\n*The Office of Sheriff falls under the [[Hawaii Department of Public Safety#Sheriff Division|Sheriff's Division]] of the [[Hawaii Department of Public Safety]].<ref>[http://www.hawaii.gov/psd/law_home.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011700/http://www.hawaii.gov/psd/law_home.php|date=September 27, 2007}}</ref> It is the functional equivalent of a [[state police]] department and has the distinction of making Hawaii the only [[U.S. state]] without an officially named state police department and one of two with a statewide Sheriff's Department (the other being Rhode Island). Although the Sheriff Division's jurisdiction covers the entire state, its primary functions are judicial and executive protection, security at the [[Hawaii State Capitol]], law enforcement at Hawaii's [[airport]]s, narcotics enforcement, prisoner transportation, the processing and service of court orders and warrants, and the patrol of certain roads and waterways in conjunction with other state agencies.\n*The Sheriff of [[Kalawao County, Hawaii]], located on the [[Kalawao County, Hawaii|Kalaupapa Peninsula]] on the north coast of the island of [[Molokai|Moloka'i]], is selected from among the 147 local residents (147 total population per the [[2000 United States Census]]), by the [[Hawaii Department of Health]], which administers the county. The sheriff is the sole county government employee.\n\n===Idaho===\nThe state of Idaho consists of 44 counties. Each county in Idaho has an elected position for the Office of Sheriff which is the supreme law enforcement of a county. The Office of Sheriff is elected in 4-year terms.\n\n===Illinois===\nIn Illinois, the sheriff is the highest law enforcement authority in each county; however, incorporated [[Municipality|municipalities]], regardless of their sizes, are responsible for primary law enforcement within their jurisdiction. Therefore, the sheriffs' offices generally concentrate their police functions on unincorporated areas. In addition, many small municipalities pay the sheriff's office a portion of their law enforcement funds for the sheriff to act as their primary law enforcement: usually either overnight, which allows the local police department to operate with local officers during the day; or full-time, relieving the village of needing its own police department.\n\nIn addition to providing policing, the sheriff's office controls the [[Prison|county jail]], guards the [[courthouse]], acts as the [[service of process|process server]] for court documents such as [[summons]]es, and oversees [[eviction]]s, even inside municipalities with their own police forces.\n\n====Cook County====\nThe [[Cook County Sheriff's Office]] is the second largest in the United States, with over 6,900 members. Due to its size, the Cook County Sheriff's Office divides its operations by task into 8 departments, the most recognizable of which is the Cook County Sheriff's Court Services Department. The much smaller Cook County Sheriff 's Police Department provides traditional police services in Unincorporated Cook County while the Department of Corrections operates the Cook County Department of Corrections.\n\nAll Cook County Sheriff's Deputies are Sworn and State certified Peace Officers with Police Powers regardless of their particular job function or title. Like other sheriffs' departments in Illinois, the Sheriff can provide all traditional law-enforcement functions, including county-wide patrol and investigations irrespective of municipal boundaries, even in the city of [[Chicago]], but has traditionally limited its police patrol functions to unincorporated areas of the county because unincorporated areas are the primary jurisdiction of a Sheriff's Department in Illinois.\n\nThe Sheriff's Police patrol services are often not required in incorporated cities because the cities such as Chicago have established their own police departments. The 500\u2013600 member Sheriff's Police Department would not have the personnel necessary to supply full police services to all incorporated areas in Cook County especially in a municipality such as Chicago.\n\nSheriff's deputies, outside the Sheriff's Police, provide the other services of the sheriff, such as guarding the various courthouses in Cook County, running and guarding the 9,800-detainee Cook County Jail, and overseeing other offender rehabilitation programs.\n\n===Indiana===\n\n[[File:Bloomfield Indiana Police with Indiana State Police circa 1948.jpg|thumb|185px|right|Greene County, Indiana Sheriff and Deputy Sheriff with the Indiana State Police circa 1940]]\n\nIn [[Indiana]], county sheriffs are elected to office and limited by the [[Constitution of Indiana|state constitution]] to serving no more than two four-year terms consecutively. Indiana sheriffs are empowered to make the [[arrest]] of persons who commit an offense within the sheriff's view, and take them before a court of the county having [[jurisdiction]], and detain them in custody until the cause of the arrest has been investigated.

Sheriffs are elected to four-year terms in office with no term limits.  \n \nSheriff's Offices within Iowa have many functions: Patrol \u2013 which is the most visible and provides public safety activities and traffic enforcement duties; Jail \u2013 according to Iowa law, the Sheriff is responsible for the operation of the county jail. This responsibility includes the transportation of prisoners, the guarding of jail facilities, and in some counties, the securing of the county courthouse; Civil \u2013 according to Iowa law, the Sheriff is responsible for the civil process, which includes serving legal documents from the court and conducting evictions, sales and other civil related duties; and Detective \u2013 which investigates crimes and conducts follow up activities on cases.\n\nAlthough a primary responsibility of the Sheriff's Office is to provide law enforcement protection to the unincorporated and rural areas of the county, most Sheriff's Offices contract to provide law enforcement services to smaller incorporated communities that do not have their own police department. \n \nA Sheriff must be a certified peace officer through the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy as required under the Code of Iowa chapter 80B or must complete the basic training course within one year of taking office. Iowa deputy sheriffs are covered by civil service law which ensures that after their probationary periods they are only removed from office for just cause. Deputy Sheriffs must complete the state law enforcement academy within their first year of employment.\n\nIn accordance with state law, the Iowa State Sheriffs' and Deputies' Association establishes the uniform and vehicle standards for all 99 counties. As such, all uniforms and patrol vehicle graphics are the same for each of the 99 Sheriff's Offices throughout Iowa with the exception of the respective County's name appearing on their badges, uniform patches, and vehicle markings. Badge numbers for Sheriffs and Deputies consist of a prefix number, which represents the county number, followed by a one to three digit number, which represents the Sheriff's or Deputy's number within that specific office. The Sheriff's badge number in each county is always #1. So the Sheriff from Bremer County would have an ID number of 9-1 (9 is the county number for Bremer County and 1 is the number for the Sheriff).\n\n===Kansas===\nSheriffs are elected officials in their counties. They serve four-year terms between elections.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sheriffs' The largest sheriffs office in Kansas, is the Sedgwick County Sheriffs office, located in the south central part of the state.History|url=http://kansassheriffs.org/sheriff_history.php|accessdate=17 February 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214015041/http://kansassheriffs.org/sheriff_history.php|archivedate=14 February 2013}}</ref> There are 105 counties in Kansas but only 104 sheriffs. In the 1970s, [[Riley County, Kansas|Riley County]] merged the police departments within the county and created the Riley County Police Department. The RCPD is head by a Director who is hired by a police board. In Riley county, any duties that a county sheriff would perform are carried out by the RCPD. A small number of sheriffs in Kansas contract their police services to cities within their county boundaries that do not wish to manage their own police departments.\n\n===Kentucky===<!-- This section is linked from [[McCreary County, Kentucky]] -->\n[[File:Unfinished portrait of Daniel Boone by Chester Harding 1820.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Daniel Boone 1782 Sherriff of Fayette County Ky]]\nSheriffs in [[Kentucky]] are elected for four-year terms and are not term limited. Sheriffs and deputies in Kentucky have the authority to patrol as well as power of arrest in all areas of their particular county, including incorporated cities. Most sheriffs, however, choose to patrol incorporated cities either only on the request of city officials or in the case of a major emergency. Sheriff's deputies will jointly patrol unincorporated areas of their county with the [[Kentucky State Police]]. In addition, sheriffs in Kentucky are responsible for court security, serving court papers and transporting prisoners. They are also responsible for collecting taxes on real estate and tangible property. Also, Kentucky law states that only the county coroner, also an elected peace officer, can serve the sitting sheriff with a state criminal court process or place him/her under arrest (any peace officer, however, can arrest the coroner).\n\nOne of the main differences between Kentucky sheriffs and sheriffs in other states is that in most counties in Kentucky sheriffs do not run the county jails. County jails are run by a separate elected official called a jailer who has the authority to employ deputy jailers. The sheriff's office, however, may be asked by the jailer to assist with jail security in the event of an emergency. The only exception is in counties containing first class cities or counties with consolidated city/county governments which may merge their offices of sheriff and jailer and retain the office of sheriff to fill both roles. In these cases the sheriff can then relinquish responsibility for the jail back to the county or consolidated government to operate. This is the case in both [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]] and [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]], which are both the only counties with first class cities ([[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] & [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] respectively) and are the only counties with merged city/county governments.\n\nDeputy sheriffs, like municipal police officers, must be trained and certified as peace officers through the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet Law Enforcement Training Center at [[Eastern Kentucky University]] in [[Richmond, Kentucky|Richmond]], unless they have previously completed another recognized police academy. To maintain certification, all certified peace officers must complete forty hours of in-service training annually. Sheriffs themselves, however, are not mandated to be trained and certified as the job requirements for sheriff are described in the [[Kentucky Constitution]], rather than the [[Kentucky Revised Statutes]]. Many sheriffs, however, do choose to receive this training if they had not received it as a law enforcement officer prior to their election.\n\n===Louisiana===\nThe [[Louisiana]] constitution establishes the office of sheriff in each parish, each elected to a term of four years (Const. Art. V, \u00a727). The sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer in the parish and has both criminal and civil jurisdiction. The sheriff is in charge of all criminal investigations and is responsible for executing court orders and process. The sheriff is the collector of [[ad valorem tax]]es and other taxes and license fees as provided by law and is the keeper of the public jail in the parish. Article V, Section 32 provides for the offices of civil sheriff and criminal sheriff in Orleans Parish. ''State & Local Government in Louisiana,'' Chapter 3 ''Local Government,'' Part. II.

All sheriff's offices have general law enforcement powers throughout their entire county,<ref>But see E. Frank Cornelius, \"The Authority of a Michigan Sheriff To Deny Law Enforcement Powers to a Deputy\", 25 Thomas M. Cooley Law Review, No. 3 (2008), 433-462.</ref> as well as traditional judicial-process, court-protection ([[bailiff]]) and jail-operation powers. Sheriff's offices may primarily patrol areas of their county without municipal police services; however, they are free to patrol anywhere in their county, including [[City|cities]], [[Village|villages]] and [[charter township]]s that have their own police services. Occasionally, this results in conflict over jurisdiction between municipal police agencies and sheriff's offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051212/METRO/512120338/1003|title=Detroit News|author=|date=|website=Detroit News|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn some counties (primarily urban counties such as [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland]], [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb]], [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne]], [[Kent County, Michigan|Kent]], [[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee]], [[Saginaw County, Michigan|Saginaw]], [[Bay County, Michigan|Bay]], [[Midland County, Michigan|Midland]] and [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw]]), sheriff's offices provide dedicated police services under contract to some municipalities, in lieu of those municipalities providing their own police services.  (Michigan law provides for or requires municipalities, depending upon their structure, to provide dedicated police services.)\n\nThe sheriffs of all 83 Michigan counties are members of the Michigan Sheriffs' Association.

Thus, all Michigan residents have at least two levels of general police services (state police and sheriff's offices), while residents of a municipality that has its own police service have a third level of general police service.\n\nThe Office of Sheriff is created by the Michigan Constitution. As a constitutional officer, the Sheriff must operate a county jail, serve and execute all civil writs and process as well as criminal process that are issued pursuant to rule, and produce and maintain records as prescribed by law. In addition, the Sheriff operates a Marine Safety Program (with the Department of Natural Resources), provides contracted law enforcement services, and miscellaneous other duties.\n\nCurrently the [[Oakland County Sheriff's Office]] is the largest full service sheriff's office in the state, overseeing over 1,400 employees and managing an annual budget of over $156 million dollars.\n\n===Minnesota===\n{{expand section|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn order to be elected to the office of County Sheriff, the candidate must be actively employed in a law enforcement vocation.

The Sheriff's office works to prevent crime and build community safety through education, investigation and enforcement. The sheriff's duties generally fall into two broad categories:\n# Law enforcement duties: These duties are specifically to keep the peace within the county, by causing all offenders to enter into bonds, with sureties, for keeping the peace and for appearing at the next circuit court, and by committing such offenders in case of refusal. The sheriff is also charged with the duty to quell riots, routs, affrays and unlawful assemblages, and to prevent lynchings and mob violence.\n# Administrative duties:\n#* Serve as the county's jailor\u2014The sheriff is required to keep separate rooms for the sexes, not permitting communication between male and female prisoners, unless they are married; provide fire and lights when necessary and proper; sufficient and clean bedding; and daily wholesome and adequate food and drink.\n#* Have charge of the courthouse and jail of his county, of the premises belonging thereto, and of the prisoners in said jail. This includes the protection of the court and prisoners from mob violence, injuries or attacks by mobs, and from trespasses and intruders.\n#* Submit a budget of his office's estimated expenses for the next fiscal year including payment of premiums on the bonds and insurance necessary to protect the interest of the county. (i.e. bonds for liability insurance, insurance against false arrest charges, insurance against false imprisonment charges, theft, fire, and other hazards insurance, and hospitalization insurance).\n#* Keep books of every kind maps, charts, and other things that may be donated to the county.\n#* Keep the Mississippi Department Reports, census reports, statutes of the state, the Mississippi Reports, digests, and legislative journals assigned to his county in the courtroom of the courthouse.\n#* Keep a jail docket noting the details of each warrant or mittimus of any person placed in the county jail.\n\n===Missouri===\nThere are 114 counties and one independent city (City of St. Louis) in Missouri. Sheriffs in Missouri are elected to a four (4) year term. The sheriff and his deputies may conduct a variety of duties within their respective jurisdictions. Section 57.100 of the Missouri Revised Statutes states that \"Every sheriff shall quell and suppress assaults and batteries, riots, routs, affrays and insurrections; shall apprehend and commit to jail all felons and traitors, and execute all process directed to him by legal authority, including writs of replevin, attachments and final process issued by circuit and associate circuit judges.\"\n\nGenerally, the sheriff is responsible for police patrol in unincorporated areas of the county, but retains full jurisdiction within the entire county. Generally, city or village police handle general law enforcement duties in incorporated areas. In addition, the sheriff is responsible for court security, serving court documents, operating the jail (some jurisdictions have separate county correctional departments), executing warrants, issuing concealed weapon carry permits, and other duties. In the Independent City of St. Louis, the sheriff's duties include court security for the Circuit Court, transporting prisoners between the Courts and detention facilities, serving court papers and eviction notices, and issuing concealed carry permits.<ref>City of St. Louis Sheriff website: {{cite web |url=http://stlouis.missouri.org/citygov/sheriff/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526124018/http://stlouis.missouri.org/citygov/sheriff/ |archivedate=2010-05-26 }}</ref> Patrol duties are handled by the City of St. Louis Police Department.\n\nSome sheriff's departments provide School Resource Deputies to public school districts under contract with the local school board. These deputies not only perform law enforcement duties, but act as mentors and instructors in safety and security related matters.\n\nIn addition, sheriffs may utilize SWAT or STAR teams, consisting of specially trained deputies who may handle hostage situations, security details, or special events. K-9 units, boat patrols, air patrols, traffic units, reserve units, and Emergency Management Division units are just some of the other specialized divisions that may be formed by the sheriff.\n\nSince January 1, 2010, Missouri Revised Statutes 57.010 states that county sheriffs must have a Missouri Peace Officer's License before they may perform any law enforcement functions. Deputy Sheriffs are considered law enforcement officers, and must be certified by The Department of Public Safety's [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) Program.\n\n===Montana===\nAll 56 Montana counties have sheriff's offices responsible for general law-enforcement functions in areas other than those covered by local city police departments. In larger cities sheriff's offices perform mainly judicial duties such as serving warrants and providing courtroom security. The sheriff, as the county's chief law enforcement officer, has jurisdiction anywhere in the county, including municipalities, where the Sheriff's Office provides assistance and support to local law enforcement agencies. Sheriff's deputies in Montana are certified by The Department of Public Safety's Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) Program. Sheriff's deputies have the full powers of arrest and can enforce all of state laws more than any other law enforcement officer in the state. Examples include fish and game violations, department of transportation regulations, department of livestock.\n\n===Nebraska===\nAll [[Nebraska]] counties have sheriff's offices responsible for general law-enforcement functions in areas other than those covered by local city police departments. Sheriff's deputies in Nebraska are certified by the state law-enforcement commission and have full arrest powers.\n\n===Nevada===\nThere are 16 sheriff's departments in Nevada, and two of them are unique, as the [[Carson City Sheriff's Office]] is a result of the 1967 merger of the old [[Carson City Police Department]] and the [[Ormsby County Sheriff's Department]], as well as the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department]] which is the result of the 1973 merger of the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department|Clark County Sheriff's Office]] and the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department#History|old Las Vegas Police Department]].\n\n===New Hampshire===\nThe [[New Hampshire]] position of [[High sheriff|High Sheriff]] dates back to pre-Revolutionary War days. Since 1840, there have been 10 [[List of counties in New Hampshire|counties in the state]], each with a High Sheriff.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nh-sheriffs.org |title=New Hampshire Sheriff's Association |website=nh-sheriffs.org |accessdate=March 31, 2020}}</ref> These sheriffs and their deputies are the highest ranking and most powerful uniformed law-enforcement officers in the state. The state constitution gives the sheriff of each county full law-enforcement authority throughout the county. In 1911, this authority was expanded by the [[New Hampshire General Court|state legislature]] to include the entire state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/VII/104/104-6.htm |title=Title VII: Sheriffs, Constables, and Police Officers {{!}} Chapter 104: Sheriffs and Constables {{!}} Section 104:6 |website=gencourt.state.nh.us |accessdate=March 31, 2020}}</ref> Sheriffs are elected to two-year terms without term limits. The sheriff is responsible for patrol duties, civil process, transport of prisoners, and criminal and civil warrants. Most county sheriff's offices provide dispatch service for many of the county's communities. Sheriffs are also responsible for the security in all the [[New Hampshire Superior Court|county courthouses]] throughout the state.

In some counties, responsibility for the county jail rests with the sheriff's office; in other counties, this responsibility rests with a separate corrections department. In most counties, the police functions provided by the sheriff's office are limited to patrolling county property such as parks, courts, county facilities, and roads; plus, providing specialized units and support to local police, e.g., [[Bomb disposal|bomb squads]], emergency response ([[SWAT]]) and investigative units. Essex County Sheriff's Bureau of Narcotics is featured in the film ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]'' which stars [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Russell Crowe]]. The [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]] Sheriff and the Hudson County Sheriff, also holds the unique title of the Office of Emergency Management and serves a highly populated urban area including [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], in Essex County, which is New Jersey's largest city and [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], in Hudson County, which is New Jersey's second largest city.\n\nNote: [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]] also has a separate county-wide police force, which fulfills many of the police functions provided by sheriff's offices in other counties.\n\nAll areas of New Jersey are incorporated municipalities and the vast majority have their own local police agencies that provide general law enforcement. The [[New Jersey State Police]] provides primary law enforcement in only a few rural areas in Southern and North Western NJ that lack local police.\n\n===New Mexico===\nNew Mexico County Sheriffs are regular law enforcement officials and have the authority to perform law enforcement duties at any location within their county of jurisdiction, but they primarily focus on unincorporated rural areas, while leaving law enforcement functions within the limits of incorporated municipalities to town or city police departments. Sheriffs occasionally assist local police departments with law enforcement in incorporated cities and towns, particularly when such assistance is requested by local police.\n\n===New York===\nLike most other states, sheriffs and deputy sheriffs in the State of [[New York (state)|New York]] are regular law-enforcement officers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysheriffs.org/|title=NY Sheriffs Association|website=www.nysheriffs.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309040013/http://nysheriffs.org/|archivedate=9 March 2018}}</ref> with full police powers and duties such as patrol work, prisoner transport, civil process, and court security.<ref>For a detailed list of the duties and rights of Sheriff in N.Y., see N.Y.

Several counties have moved away from these practices. Patrol cars in these counties have different vehicle markings, and deputy sheriffs wear different uniforms. Some examples are [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]], which has dark gray uniforms similar to the New York State Police; and [[Warren County, New York|Warren County]], whose deputy sheriffs wear tan shirts with dark brown pants. [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]] Deputy Sheriffs wear tactical Class B uniforms consisting of black shirts and black pants and a Class A uniform with light blue shirts with darker blue pants. In [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], the sheriff vehicles are black and white (similar to the police/sheriff vehicle scheme used in California). In [[New York City]], deputy sheriffs wear a uniform very similar to sworn [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] personnel. [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] Sheriff's deputies wear the traditional uniform; black pants, black shirt with brass buttons, and a black stetson.\n\nCurrently there are 57 county sheriff's offices, and one city sheriff's office (see below) which covers the five boroughs (counties) of New York City. The largest sheriff's office in New York State is the [[Erie County Sheriff's Office (New York)|Erie County Sheriff's Office]], followed by the [[Suffolk County Sheriff's Office|Suffolk County Sheriff's Department]] with around 275 deputies and 900 correction officers.\n\nSheriffs in New York State (outside of New York City, Nassau and Westchester Counties) are elected for three or four-year terms, depending on the vote of the county government, specifically the county legislature. The Sheriff of New York City is appointed by the mayor (see below) and the Sheriffs of Nassau County and Westchester County are appointed by the county executives of those respective counties.<ref>N.Y.

The Office of the Sheriff is the primary law enforcement agency for the unincorporated areas of North Carolina's counties. The Sheriff, as the county's chief law enforcement officer, has jurisdiction anywhere in the county, including municipalities, where the Sheriff's Office provides assistance and support to local law enforcement agencies.\n\nLaw enforcement duties of this Office include patrolling the counties, preventing crime, investigating violations of the law, and apprehending law violators. In addition, support services, such as communications, evidence, and property control services are provided. The Sheriff is also responsible for keeping and maintaining the common jail of the county, which currently consists of separate detention facilities at the County Public Safety Centers and the Detention Annex if required by the counties. The Office is responsible for transporting prisoners for court appearances.\n\nIn the area of judicial services, the Office of the Sheriff serves as the enforcement arm of the [[:Category:North Carolina state courts|North Carolina General Court of Justice]].<ref>The North Carolina General Court of Justice consists of three divisions: appellate, superior court, and district court.</ref> The Office serves civil and criminal processes issued by the courts, which often includes arresting persons and bringing them before the courts, as well as the seizure and sale of personal and real property to satisfy court judgments. The Sheriff is responsible for courtroom security in the District and Superior courtrooms in the county.\n\nOther miscellaneous duties of the Office mandated by the State include pistol purchase permits, concealed handgun permits, parade and picketing permits, and maintaining [[Sex offender registries in the United States|registries of sexual offenders]] and domestic violators.\n\nIn North Carolina, the sheriff is elected to a 4-year term, and may not be a [[felony|felon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Legislation/constitution/article7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-06 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208093558/http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Legislation/constitution/article7.html |archivedate=2012-02-08 }}</ref>  A county sheriff is responsible not to county authorities but to the citizens of the county. County governments are responsible for providing funding to the Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe Sheriff of the NC county is the highest ranking law enforcement officer in each of the state's 100 counties and has complete at-will power to hire and terminate personnel at his-her will and pleasure. Deputies and jailers serve a term concurrent with the sheriff, not to exceed 4 years and must be re-sworn every 4 years. Jailers are custodial officers and must complete a 160-hour jailer training course, though some are also dually trained and sworn as deputies. Deputies must complete the state mandated 600+ hour Basic Law Enforcement Training (BLET) course, or do a \"re-entry\" or reentry syllabus for former or lateral (out of state officers). Other than the reentry option, the training for deputies is the same as for police officers, and other peace officers to be certified. The sheriff however, can hire deputies and has one year to get them trained and certified. This allows a sheriff who comes in office to, if he-she chooses, to replace an entire or partial department with untrained appointees and there is then one year to get the new deputies trained and certified. Deputies are a political extension of the sheriff and have no independent statutory power and when an arrest or action is made in an official capacity, it is done in the name of the sheriff as a de facto power of attorney. This is why legally, a sheriff, unlike a police chief, can dismiss arrests and charges filed by deputies for any or no reason, and this is done frequently for political purposes, Police chiefs cannot do so, as the officers are a separate and distinct legal entity named in legislation,\n\nExceptions to the County Sheriff in North Carolina are that of two of North Carolina's Counties, Gaston and Mecklenburg.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.co.gaston.nc.us/gastonpd/index.htm |title=Archived copy of Gaston County Police Department|accessdate=2007-11-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218064158/http://www.co.gaston.nc.us/gastonpd/index.htm |archivedate=2007-12-18 }}</ref> These Counties have police forces for the whole county, as well as a Sheriff Department that is responsible for the jails, courts and civil process, in addition to gun permits, sex offender database and other specific sheriff duties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.co.gaston.nc.us/sheriff |title=Archived copy of Gaston County Sheriff's Department |accessdate=2008-06-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501211909/http://www.co.gaston.nc.us/sheriff/ |archivedate=2008-05-01 }}</ref>\n* In Gaston County, the [[Gaston County Police Department]] is responsible for county-wide police services for the incorporated and unincorporated areas of the county, while overlapping with City and Township police.

The first Sheriff on the record in Ohio and the [[Northwest Territory]] was Colonel [[Ebenezer Sproat]], who served fourteen years in the position. When he was appointed in 1788, Colonel Sproat's jurisdiction covered all of Washington County; this enormous area of land then included all of eastern Ohio from the Ohio River to Lake Erie. The \"First to Serve Since 1788\" motto on Ohio sheriff vehicles refers to Sheriff Sproat's service.\n\nAfter statehood, only three public offices in Ohio were filled via the electoral-process system. The position of Sheriff was one of them. Through this new system, William Skinner became the first elected Sheriff in the Buckeye State. Since the early 19th century, Ohio sheriffs have been elected at the county level for four-year terms.\n\nIn each of the 88 counties of Ohio, the sheriff is the chief law-enforcement officer. The primary duties of the sheriff are to provide common pleas court services and corrections on a countywide basis, and full police protection to the unincorporated areas of the county; however, the sheriff also maintains full police jurisdiction in all municipalities, townships, and villages. Each sheriff is also statutorily required to provide line law enforcement, court security and service of papers, jail operations, extradition process, and transportation of prisoners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buckeyesheriffs.org|title=Buckeye State Sheriffs' Association|website=www.buckeyesheriffs.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413130709/https://www.buckeyesheriffs.org/|archivedate=13 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn an effort to become consistent on a statewide level, Ohio sheriffs and deputies wear a standardized uniform, and all patrol vehicles are marked in the same manner.\n\n===Oklahoma===\n[[Oklahoma]]'s [[Government of Oklahoma#The County Sheriff|Sheriffs]], whose primary role is as an [[officer of the court]], provide full services, that is, providing traditional law-enforcement functions such as countywide patrol and investigations. As the chief peace officer of each of Oklahoma's 77 counties, the Sheriffs serve and execute all process, writs, precepts and orders issued or made by lawful authorities, namely the courts. The Sheriff's office also provides security for judges and courthouses. The Sheriffs are in charge of and have custody over the jail of their county, and all the prisoners in the jail are under the Sheriff's supervision, with the Sheriff serving as the county's jailer.\n\nUnder their law-enforcement responsibilities, the Sheriffs are responsible for ensuring that the peace is preserved, [[riot]]s are suppressed, and that unlawful assemblies and [[insurrection]]s are controlled throughout their county. To ensure justice is administered, the Sheriff is empowered to apprehend any person charged with a felony or breach of the peace and may attend any court within the county. The Sheriffs are also [[Posse comitatus (common law)|empowered]] to [[conscription|conscript]] any person or persons of their county that they may deem necessary to fulfill their duties.\n\n===Oregon===\nGeneral duties of sheriff\n\nThe sheriff is the chief executive officer and conservator of the peace of the county. In the execution of the office of sheriff, it is the sheriff's duty to:\n\n(1) Arrest and commit to prison all persons who break the peace, or attempt to break it, and all persons guilty of public offenses.\n\n(2) Defend the county against those who, by riot or otherwise, endanger the public peace or safety.\n\n(3) Execute the process and orders of the courts of justice or of judicial officers, when delivered to the sheriff for that purpose, according to law.\n\n(4) Execute all warrants delivered to the sheriff for that purpose by other public officers, according to law.\n\n(5) Attend, upon call, the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Oregon Tax Court, circuit court, justice court or county court held within the county, and to obey its lawful orders or directions. [Amended by 1985 c.339 \u00a71]\n\nThere are 36 counties in Oregon with 36 elected sheriffs, each holding a four-year term of office. Sheriffs in Oregon provide full-service law enforcement, enforcing all state and local laws, maintaining active traffic safety and enforcement units, managing the county jail, providing marine boating safety patrols, being responsible for county Search and Rescue, and providing law enforcement services for the courts. Many Oregon sheriffs have dedicated specialized teams that include traffic safety, SWAT, interagency drug teams, K9, and rescue.\n\n===Pennsylvania===\n[[Pennsylvania]] sheriffs legally have all traditional law enforcement powers. But, since the establishment of the [[Pennsylvania State Police]] in 1905, in practice most of the 67 counties' sheriff's offices perform traditional court-related functions, transporting prisoners to and from court, etc.\n\nThe status of Pennsylvania's county sheriffs was in a legal gray area for many years. While sheriffs routinely provided court security, prisoner transport, civil process services and bench warrant arrests, it was unclear whether they had law-enforcement powers. From the 1970s through the early 1990s, a number of defendants charged by deputy sheriffs with crimes attempted to [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Exclusionary rule|suppress]] the results of their arrests, on the basis that the deputies were not ''bona fide'' law-enforcement officers.\n\nIn ''Commonwealth of Pennsylvania vs. Leet'', a 1991 decision by the Pennsylvania Superior Court, a 2\u20131 majority of the Court held that deputy sheriffs had no law-enforcement powers. That decision was reversed by the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Supreme Court]] in a 1994 decision by Justice John P. Flaherty. He held that sheriffs have  the power to enforce motor-vehicle laws (at issue in this case) for violations committed in their presence. In his majority opinion, Justice Flaherty explored the historical roots of the office of Sheriff in the United Kingdom and the United States and concluded that the powers developed as a matter of [[common law]]:\n\n{{quote|Though it may be unnecessary to cite additional authority, [[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Blackstone]] confirms the common-law power of the sheriff to make arrests without warrant for felonies and for breaches of the peace committed in his presence. Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Common Law,'' Vol. IV, at 289. Indeed, such powers are so widely known and so universally recognized that it is hardly necessary to cite authority for the proposition. To make the point, how few children would question that the infamous [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] had at least the authority to arrest [[Robin Hood]].}}\n\nSheriffs and their deputies in Pennsylvania can therefore make [[arrests]] for felonies and breaches of the peace committed in their presence. They are required by statute to be trained and certified by the [http://www.pccd.state.pa.us Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency].\n\nIn the early 21st century, every Pennsylvania county has a Sheriff's Office. Most are still elected, but [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton]] and [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne]] counties have adopted [[home rule]] charters that stipulate the Sheriff will be an appointed position and no longer elected. This has led to some overlap in places such as [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]], where the [[Allegheny County Police Department|County Police]] are responsible for supporting local law-enforcement and patrolling county-owned property, including the [[Pittsburgh International Airport]].\n\nSimilarly, the [[Delaware County Courthouse and Park Police Department]] provides [[security police]] functions. With the newly reestablished law enforcement powers of the [[Sheriff|County Sheriff]], however, this has led to some power struggles.\n\n====Philadelphia County====\nAs part of the government of the [[Philadelphia|City of Philadelphia]], which encompasses the county, the Sheriff is elected<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seventy.org/hot-topics/-2007-election-information/upcoming-election-information/Philadelpiha|title=election information from the Committee of Seventy|author=|date=|website=seventy.org|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref> for a four-year term. The Sheriff provides basic court-related services such as transporting prisoners, providing courthouse security, and other duties with regard to service of process and summonses that are issued by county and state courts.

The sheriff shall keep and preserve the peace within his county, for which purpose he is empowered to call to his aid such persons or power of his county as he may deem necessary. He must pursue and apprehend all felons, and must execute all writs, warrants, and other process from any court or magistrate which shall be directed to him by legal authority.\" Every county in the state of South Dakota is required to hold an election for Sheriff every 4 (four) years. There is no limit to how many consecutive 4 (four) year terms an individual can serve as Sheriff. Sheriff Departments in South Dakota typically rely on the assistance of the South Dakota Highway Patrol for SWAT and high risk warrant services. The Sheriff in all counties has law enforcement powers, they also serve court documents both civil and criminal, provide courthouse security, conduct investigations, and usually operate a county jail. Some counties contract-out jail space for other counties to use. (Fees are usually determined by the number of inmates housed per day.) Sheriffs are required by state law to be paid a minimum annual salary. The law and guidelines are shown below. Sheriffs' salary schedule. The board of county commissioners shall establish, by resolution, the salary payable to the sheriff. The salary payable may not be less than the following schedule based upon the most recent decennial federal census of population of counties.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| County population || Salary schedule\n|-\n| Below 10,000 || $35,700\n|-\n| 10,000\u201314,999 || $38,700\n|-\n| 15,000\u201324,999 || $39,900\n|-\n| 25,000\u201369,999 || $44,700\n|-\n| 70,000 and over || $48,600\n|}\n \nThe board of county commissioners may not decrease the salary of the sheriff during consecutive terms of office of the sheriff. Any sheriff having responsibility for managing a full-time jail shall receive an additional ten percent added to the base salary listed in this section.\n\n===Tennessee===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\nThe [[Constitution of Tennessee|Tennessee]] [[Constitution]] requires each county to elect a sheriff to a four-year term. In all Tennessee counties except one, the sheriff is an official with full police powers, county-wide, although Tennessee sheriffs and their deputies generally perform the patrol portion of their duties in unincorporated areas of their counties if the municipalities have their own police departments. The exception to the rule is [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]]. In Davidson County, the sheriff has the primary responsibility of serving civil process and jail functions without the [[common law]] powers to keep the peace. Protection of the peace is instead the responsibility of the [[Metropolitan Nashville Police Department]] under the county's [[consolidated city-county|Metropolitan Charter]]. The Metropolitan Charter did not remove the Davidson County Sheriff's status as a Law Enforcement officer however. It is simply not his or her primary function as it was prior to the consolidation of the City of Nashville and Davidson County.\n[[File:Knox County Sheriffs Office (3580515538).jpg|thumb|right|[[Knox County, Tennessee]] sheriff's vehicle]]\n\n===Texas===\nThe [[Constitution of Texas|Texas]] [[Constitution]] (Article 5, Section 23) provides for the election of a sheriff in each one of the 254 counties.

The sheriff must be a Utah State Certified Peace Officer when elected or must be certified shortly after the election. All peace officers in Utah are certified by the Utah Peace Officer's Academy, known as POST (Peace Officer Standardization and Training). The sheriffs are responsible to protect the courts, with bailiffs employed for that purpose. They also operate the jail within their county, with corrections officers. Sheriff's deputies provide routine law enforcement services to the unincorporated portions of the county and are considered police officers.\n\nA portion of the sheriff's office carries out civil process at the direction of the courts. All Utah State Certified Peace Officers have authority to arrest throughout the State of Utah. They may also arrest outside the state, for crimes committed within the state. Persons arrested by Utah Peace Officers outside of the State of Utah must turned over to local authorities for extradition. Utah Peace Officers may return arrestees without extradition, if they are arrested following a hot pursuit which exits the state.\n\n===Vermont===\nSheriff responsibilities in Vermont include furnishing security for fourteen county superior courts and two district courts,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vtd.uscourts.gov/court-info/court-locations/trenton|title=Burlington - DISTRICT OF VERMONT - United States District Court|website=www.vtd.uscourts.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006182113/http://www.vtd.uscourts.gov/court-info/court-locations/trenton|archivedate=6 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vtd.uscourts.gov/content/rutland|title=Rutland - DISTRICT OF VERMONT - United States District Court|website=www.vtd.uscourts.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229194446/http://www.vtd.uscourts.gov/content/rutland|archivedate=29 December 2017}}</ref> serving civil and criminal papers, transportation of prisoners, patrolling towns, motor vehicle and snowmobile enforcement, and furnishing security for special events.\n\n===Virginia===\nThe position of sheriff is established by the Virginia Constitution, with the sheriff and his deputies having both civil and concurrent criminal jurisdiction countywide. Sheriffs terms are for four years and are not term limited. Unlike other states, the Sheriff is not necessarily the chief law enforcement officer; in a city that has a police department, a Chief of Police has that distinction according to statute. However, a sheriff is chief law enforcement officer in any county. In such areas, the [[Chief of Police]] is the highest-ranking officer, such as in incorporated towns or cities.\n\nVirginia is unique in that all cities are independent jurisdictions and are completely separate from any county. Thus, most cities (with few exceptions such as Poquoson and Franklin) have elected sheriffs, most of which focus on court and jail operations. By law, sheriffs can enforce all the laws of the Commonwealth in the jurisdiction they serve. Some city sheriffs (such as Portsmouth and Newport News) also work alongside the city police in responding to calls and enforcing traffic violations.\n\nIn cities such as Poquoson and Franklin, these cities grew out of a county and still use that county's sheriff for civil process and court services. Those sheriff's offices still have concurrent jurisdiction in those cities but do not generally exercise them, allowing the city police to handle criminal/traffic matters.\n\nAll sheriffs are responsible for civil process, jails, serving levies and holding sheriff's sales to satisfy judgements.\n\nSince 1983, when the General Assembly passed legislation allowing counties to establish police departments by referendum, only seven counties have done so. In most of those counties, such as Henrico and Chesterfield, the sheriffs offices exercise criminal enforcement authority sharing it with the county police, but generally let the county police investigate most crime.\n\nThe city of Williamsburg incorporated as a city from James City County in 1699. Prior to 1983, the sheriff's office handled all police functions for James City County while a sheriff performed court/jail functions for Williamsburg. When James City County established its county police department, that department operated under the county sheriff for two years before becoming a separate agency. Williamsburg's sheriff's office comprised only 8 personnel, it eventually merged with the county's sheriff's office to form the Williamsburg-James City County Sheriff's office.\n\nIn the early 1990s the General Assembly mandated the uniforms for all sheriffs as being dark brown shirts with tan pants that have a brown stripe. Sheriff's Office vehicles were to be dark brown with a five-point star on the front doors and \"Sheriff's Office\" on the trunk. The five-point star must have the jurisdiction's name in a half circle on the star and \"Sheriff's Office\" in a half circle under that.\n\nIn the early first decade of the 21st century, legislation was passed to allow sheriffs to purchase white vehicles (if agreed to by the city or county), and allowing sheriffs' deputies to wear any color uniform the sheriff chose. Sheriffs' vehicles still must have the star on the front doors and markings on the trunk as before.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office, in conjunction with local police departments, assist with controlling traffic, issuing traffic summonses, and working with state and local law-enforcement agencies. Additionally, sheriff's deputies aid the [[county police]], the United States Marshals Service, and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in a joint [[fugitive task force]] that provides apprehension and arrest of felons who face current warrants. Sheriffs and police also share the responsibility of executing detention orders for those who are ordered to receive mental health care, but if the subject is being transported, frequently the jurisdiction\u2019s deputies will conduct the transport. \n\nThere is no distinction made by title, all those who work for a sheriff are deputies. All deputies and police officers must meet state certification standards as set by DCJS (Department of Criminal Justice Services).\n\nBy law, sheriffs are not elected at the same time. County sheriffs are sworn into office on even-numbered years; city sheriffs are sworn into office on odd-numbered years. All deputies must be re-sworn after each election. Sheriffs have complete authority to hire and fire as they see fit; deputy sheriffs serve at the sole pleasure of the sheriff. Sheriff's offices are completely funded by the state, unless a county or city wishes to supplement with funding.\n\n===Washington===\nIn [[Washington (state)|Washington]], each sheriff of the thirty-nine counties is an elected official serving a four-year term.\n\nThe voters of Pierce County voted to pass Charter Amendment 1 on November 7, 2006, to change the sheriff's position from appointed to elected. The first sheriff's election in 30 years was held in 2008.\n[[File:Skagit County Sheriff's Office (17612388133).jpg|thumb|right|[[Skagit County, Washington]] sheriff's vehicle]]\nThe sheriff is the chief law-enforcement officer of a county and is empowered to enforce the criminal laws of the State of Washington and the county their office represents, as well as to serve (once the sheriff has received adequate payment for services rendered) or execute civil processes (such as court orders, evictions, property foreclosures, tax warrants) after payment has been made to the civil division of the county sheriff's office [https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=36.18.040]; to maintain county jails; to provide courthouse security; and to provide general law enforcement in unincorporated areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.28|title=Chapter 36.28 RCW: COUNTY SHERIFF|website=apps.leg.wa.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20071118051114/http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.28|archivedate=18 November 2007}}</ref> In many cities, police services are contracted to the sheriff's department in lieu of a city police department.\n\nThe [[King County Sheriff's Office|King County Sheriff]] is the largest sheriff office in the state. The sheriff in this county, however, has no jurisdiction over the King County Jail as it was separated from his or her control.\n\n===West Virginia===\nIn [[West Virginia]], the sheriff of a given [[County (United States)|county]] performs two distinct duties. They are the chief law-enforcement officers in the county, although much of this duty is handled by their chief deputies. They are also responsible for the collection of any taxes due to the county. While many sheriffs have a background in professional law enforcement, others are politicians or other local notables. West Virginia sheriffs are limited to two consecutive four-year terms.\n\n===Wisconsin===\nIn [[Wisconsin]], sheriff's departments are responsible for law enforcement in towns and villages not large enough to support their own police departments. A sheriff's department may also aid local departments when requested. In [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] specifically, the sheriff's department is the agency of record for all [[County Trunk Highways (Wisconsin)|lettered county trunk highways]], the county's freeway system, [[Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport]], unincorporated areas, and the [[Parks of Milwaukee|county park system]].\n\n===Wyoming===\n\n==Notable American sheriffs==\n*[[Bat Masterson]] \u2013 [[Ford County, Kansas]]\n*[[John Coffee Hays]]-[[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]] (1860)\n*[[Benjamin  McCulloch]]-[[Sacramento, California]] (1860)\n*[[Buford Pusser]] \u2013 [[McNairy County, Tennessee]] portrayed in [[Walking Tall (1973 film)|Walking Tall]], and in a suite of songs on [[Drive-By Truckers]]' 2004 album, ''[[The Dirty South (album)|The Dirty South]]''.\n*[[Daniel Boone]] \u2013 [[Fayette County, Kentucky]]\n*[[Dave Reichert]] \u2013 [[King County, Washington]], tracked the [[Gary Ridgway|Green River killer]]; elected to Congress in 2004.\n*[[David Clarke (sheriff)|David A.

In a small sheriff's office, the deputies are supervised directly by the sheriff. Large sheriffs offices have several ranks in a similar manner to a police department. The  [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] has thousands of regular deputies, who are 8 ranks below the sheriff. The actual second-in-command of the sheriff typically holds the title of [[chief deputy]] or [[undersheriff]]. In some counties, the undersheriff is the [[Prison warden|warden]] of the [[Prison|county jail]].\n\n===Election===\nOf the 50 [[U.S. state]]s, 48 have sheriffs. The two exceptions are [[Alaska]], which [[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|does not have counties]], and [[Connecticut]], which [[List of counties in Connecticut|has no county governments]]. [[Washington, D.C.|The federal district]] and the 5 [[Territories of the United States|populated territories]] also do not have county governments.\n\nSheriffs are elected to four-year terms in 42&nbsp;states, two-year terms in [[Arkansas]] and [[New Hampshire]], three-year terms in [[New Jersey]], and six-year terms in [[Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web |title=OFFICE OF SHERIFF STATE-BY-STATE ELECTIONS INFORMATION | date=27 September 2012 |publisher=National Sheriffs' Association |url=http://www.sheriffs.org/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/Office%20of%20Sheriff%20State-by-State%20Election%20Chart%20updated%202012_0.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019085635/http://www.sheriffs.org/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/Office%20of%20Sheriff%20State-by-State%20Election%20Chart%20updated%202012_0.pdf |archive-date=19 October 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Sheriffs are appointed instead of elected in [[Hawaii]], [[Rhode Island]] and a small number of counties elsewhere.\n\nIn many rural areas of the United States, particularly in the [[Southern United States|South]] and [[Western United States|West]], the sheriff has traditionally been viewed as one of a given county's most influential political office-holders.\n\n==Duties==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nThe role of a sheriff's office varies considerably from state to state and even from county to county. Sheriffs and their deputies (in all states except Delaware, where the sheriff's defined role is going through arbitration) tend to be sworn peace officers with the power to make arrests and serve before a magistrate or judge, serve warrants for arrest or order for arrest, and give a ticket/citation. Some states extend this authority to adjacent counties or to the entire state. In a small sheriff's office, the sheriff is likely to carry out law enforcement duties just like a regular deputy or police officer. In medium-sized or large sheriff's office, this is rare.\n\nMany sheriff's offices also perform other functions such as traffic control, animal enforcement, accident investigations, homicide investigation, narcotics investigation, transportation of prisoners, school resource officers, and courthouse security. Larger departments may perform other criminal investigations or engage in other specialized law enforcement activities. Some larger sheriff's departments may have [[aviation]] (including fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters), motorcycle units, [[Police dog|K9 units]], [[SWAT|tactical units]], mounted details, or water patrols at their disposal.\n\nIn some areas of the country, such as in California's [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino]], [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]], [[Orange County, California|Orange]], [[Sierra County, California|Sierra]], [[Tulare County, California|Tulare]] and [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]] counties, the sheriff's office also has the responsibility of a [[coroner]]'s office, and is charged with recovering deceased persons within their county and conducting [[Autopsy|autopsies]]. The official in charge of such sheriff's departments is typically titled sheriff-coroner or sheriff/coroner, and officers who perform this function for such departments are typically titled deputy sheriff-coroner or deputy coroner.\n\nMany sheriff's departments enlist the aid of local neighborhoods, using a [[community policing]] strategy, in working to prevent crime. The National Neighborhood Watch Program, sponsored by the National Sheriffs' Association, allows civilians and law enforcement officers to cooperate in keeping communities safe.\n\nAs the trends of sheriff's law enforcement duties becoming more extensive and complex continues, new career opportunities for people with specialized skills are opening up in sheriff's offices around the country. Among the specialties now in demand are underwater diving, piloting, boating, snow skiing, radar technology, communications, computer technology, accounting, emergency medicine, and foreign languages.\n\nSheriff's offices may coexist with other county level law enforcement agencies such as [[county police]], county park police, etc.\n\n==Sheriff's categories==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nSheriffs in the United States generally fall into three broad categories:\n\n*Restricted service \u2013 provide basic court related services such as keeping the [[Prison|county jail]], transporting [[prison]]ers, providing [[courthouse]] security and other duties with regard to [[service of process]] and [[summons]]es that are issued by county and state [[court]]s. The sheriff also often conducts [[public auction]] sales of [[real property]] in [[foreclosure]] in many jurisdictions, and is often also empowered to conduct seizures of [[Personal property|chattel]] property to satisfy a [[Judgment (law)|judgment]]. In other jurisdictions, these civil process duties are performed by other officers, such as a [[marshal]] or [[constable]]. An example is the [[Philadelphia Sheriff's Office]] in Pennsylvania.\n*Limited service \u2013 along with the above, perform some type of traditional law-enforcement function such as investigations and patrol. This may be limited to [[security police]] duties on county properties (and others by contract) to the performance of these duties in unincorporated areas of the county, and some incorporated areas by contract. \n*Full service \u2013 The most common type, provide all traditional law-enforcement functions, including countywide patrol and investigations irrespective of municipal boundaries.\n\nNote: There are two federal equivalents of the sheriff; the first is the [[United States Marshals Service]], an agency of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]. There are 94 United States Marshals, one for each federal judicial district. The U.S. Marshal and his or her Deputy Marshals are responsible for the transport of prisoners and security for the [[United States district court]]s, and also issue and enforce certain civil processes.\n\nThe other is the [[Marshal of the United States Supreme Court]] who performs all court related duties for the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].\n\n==Sheriff types by state==\n\n===Alabama===\nIn Alabama, a sheriff is an elected official and the chief law enforcement officer in any given county. There is one sheriff for each of [[List of counties in Alabama|Alabama's 67 counties]], with a varying number of deputies and various staff members (usually dependent on the population). A sheriff's office generally provides law-enforcement services to unincorporated towns and cities within the boundaries of the counties.\n\n===Alaska===\nThe office of sheriff does not exist in Alaska by the State's Constitution. Instead the functions that would be performed by lower-48 sheriffs and their deputies (such as civil process, court security, and prisoner transport) are performed by [[Alaska State Troopers]] and Alaska DPS Judicial Services Officers, who are the equivalent of \"bailiffs\" in lower-48 jurisdictions. AJS officers wear uniforms similar to troopers and staff district court facilities statewide but not magistrate's courts. Their peace officer status is limited to courthouses and when transporting prisoners in custody. Additionally, with no county jails, Alaska Dept. Of Corrections runs regional prisons which have separate male and female inmate  \"pretrial wings\", which keep pretrial inmates who are legally innocent, separate from convicted prisoners who are serving a court imposed sentence following a criminal conviction. Pretrial wing units are the AK equivalent of lower-48 county jails. This uniquely makes AK DOC officers both correctional officers and jailers. Pretrial units house persons charged who are formally charged with crimes and remanded to pretrial custody, vs. traditional prisons for persons convicted and sentenced to a term of incarceration.\n\n===Arizona===\n[[File:Captain Buckey O'Neill.png|thumb|right|William Owen Buckey O'Neill, Yuma Arizona Sheriff 1888]]\n\n[[File:Young Carl hayden-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Arizona Sheriff (later U.S. Senator) [[Carl Hayden]]]]\n\nIn Arizona, a sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer of one of the [[List of counties in Arizona|15 counties]] of the state, with a varying number of deputies and assorted staff (usually dependent on population). A constitutional officer specifically established by the [[Constitution of Arizona|Arizona Constitution]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Const.

In addition, many sheriff's offices have agreements with the [[Arizona Department of Corrections]] (ADC) and local police agencies to provide for the transport and detention of prisoners. After sentencing, many convicted persons are remanded over to the ADC to serve their sentence, but this has not always been the case.\n\nArizona is unique in that many sheriff's offices have formed semi-permanent [[Posse comitatus|posse]] units which can be operated as a reserve to the main deputized force under a variety of circumstances, as opposed to solely for fugitive retrieval as is historically associated with the term.<ref>{{cite web|title=A.R.S. \u00a711-441(8)(D)|url=https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https://www.azleg.gov/ars/11/00441.htm|website=Arizona State Legislature|accessdate=23 March 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428185301/https://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.azleg.gov%2Fars%2F11%2F00441.htm|archivedate=28 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Maricopa County Sheriff's Office]] (MCSO) is the largest sheriff's office in Arizona and the third-largest in the United States, with a total of 575 sworn officers and 2,735 civilian and detention employees {{as of|2017|lc=y}}. MCSO is headed by Sheriff [[Paul Penzone]].\n\n===Arkansas===\n\n[[File:Arkansas 2012-03-18 013.jpg|thumb|right|[[Phillips County, Arkansas]] [[Police car|sheriff cruiser]]]]\n\nIn Arkansas, sheriffs and their deputies are fully empowered peace officers with county-wide jurisdiction and thus, may legally exercise their authority in unincorporated and incorporated areas of a county.   Under state law, sheriffs and their deputies, as well as all other law enforcement and peace officers, are \"on-duty\" 24 hours a day, meaning they can make arrests with or without a warrant (provided the warrant-less arrest is a result of a violation of law committed in their presence or view).\n\nThe duties of an Arkansas sheriff generally include providing law enforcement services to residents, managing county jail(s), and providing bailiffs for the county, district, circuit, and other courts within the county. By Arkansas Law, the Sheriff is the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the County.  There are 75 county sheriffs in Arkansas, one for each county, regardless of its population size.\n\nWith very limited exceptions, sheriffs and their deputies may exercise their official authority only within the geographical boundaries of their specific county.\n\nThe office of sheriff was created by the state constitution and the office has not been substantially changed in 100 years.\n\nSheriffs in Arkansas are elected in even numbered years by citizens of their county to serve a term of four years in office in accordance with the state constitution. Sheriffs rely upon the county's legislative body, known as the \"[[Commissioners' court|Quorum Court]]\", to appropriate funding and approve the yearly operating budget. However, in all other circumstances, the sheriff is entirely independent in the management of his elected office and is not subservient to or accountable to any other elected county official or body.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nUnder Arkansas law, a sheriff cannot campaign for reelection while wearing a county owned badge.\n\n===California===\nIn [[California]], a sheriff is an elected official and the chief law enforcement officer in any given county. The sheriff's department of each county polices [[unincorporated area]]s (areas of the county that do not lie within the jurisdiction of a police department of an incorporated municipality). As such, the sheriff and his or her deputies in rural areas and unincorporated municipalities are equivalent to police officers in the cities. The sheriff's department may also provide policing services to incorporated cities by contract (see [[contract city]]). Sheriff's departments in California are also responsible for enforcing criminal law on Native American tribal land, as prescribed by [[Public Law 280]], which was enacted in 1953. The law transferred the responsibility of criminal law enforcement on tribal land from the federal government to state governments in specified states.\n\nAll [[Law enforcement officer|peace officers]] in California are able to exercise their police powers anywhere in the state, on or off duty, regardless of county or municipal boundaries, thus California sheriffs and their deputies have full police powers in incorporated and unincorporated municipalities, outside their own counties, and on state freeways and interstates.\n\nBefore 2000, there was a [[constable]] or [[marshal]] in most (but not all) of California's 58 counties. The constable or marshal was responsible for providing [[bailiff]]s to the Municipal and Justice Courts and for serving [[Service of process|criminal and civil process]]. During a reorganization of the state judicial system early in the first decade of the 21st century, the roles of constable, marshal, and sheriff were merged, so that California sheriffs assumed the duties of most marshals, and the position of constable was eliminated entirely. The marshals offices continued to exist in only three counties\u2014[[Shasta County, California|Shasta]], [[Trinity County, California|Trinity]], and [[San Benito County, California|San Benito]]\u2014where they perform all court-security and warrant-service functions.\n\n====Los Angeles County====\nThe [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] (LASD) serves [[Los Angeles County, California]]. With over 18,000 employees, it is the largest Sheriff's department in the United States and provides general-service law enforcement to unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County, serving as the equivalent of the city police for unincorporated areas of the county as well as incorporated cities within the county who have contracted with the agency for law-enforcement services (known as \"contract cities\" in local jargon). It also holds primary jurisdiction over facilities operated by Los Angeles County, such as local parks, marinas and government buildings; provides [[marshal]] service for the [[California superior courts|Superior Court of California]], [[Los Angeles County, California|County of Los Angeles]]; operates the [[Prison|county jail]] system; and provides services such as laboratories and academy training to smaller law enforcement agencies within the county.\n\n====San Francisco====\n{{Main|San Francisco Sheriff's Department}}\nBecause the [[San Francisco|City and County of San Francisco]] are [[Consolidated city-county|consolidated and coterminous]]\u2014the only consolidated city and county in California\u2014the San Francisco Sheriff historically possessed law enforcement authority. However, as the [[San Francisco Police Department]] provides general police service for the city, the Sheriff's Department handles judicial duties, staffs the jail, and provides law enforcement services for city facilities such as [[San Francisco City Hall]] and [[San Francisco General Hospital]]. San Francisco Sheriff's deputies back up the San Francisco Police as needed, as well as make arrests for criminal and vehicle-code violations while performing their duties.\n\n===Colorado===\n\nThe Denver Sheriff Department maintains the county correctional facilities as well as court functions. Law enforcement and investigations are the responsibility of the [[Denver Police Department]]. Denver's sheriff is appointed by the mayor, and serves as the sworn head of the sheriff department. Denver has had deputy sheriffs since the creation of the City & County of Denver in 1902, however the Denver Sheriff Department current organization was not established until 1969, consolidating all of the sheriff's functions under one management structure.\n\nThe Denver Sheriff is, along with [[Broomfield, Colorado|Broomfield's]], an anomaly within the state. In every other county, the Sheriff is an elected official and is the chief law enforcement officer of his county.\n\n===Connecticut===\nConnecticut abolished county sheriffs in 2000 by Public Act 00-01. All civil-process-serving deputies were sworn in as state marshals, and criminal special deputies were sworn in as judicial marshals. Constables remain municipal officers governed by their respective town or city. A few towns have local sheriffs that primarily perform process serving duties and may act as a [[Serjeant-at-arms|sergeant at arms]] for town meetings.\n\nPrior to the abolition of county sheriffs in 2000, duties of sheriffs in Connecticut were limited to process serving, court bailiffs, and executing search and arrest warrants. Other law enforcement duties, such as emergency response, highway patrol and traffic enforcement, and maintaining public order were left to municipal police departments or constables or the Connecticut State Police in places where no local police agency exists.\n\n===Delaware===\nThe first [[Constitution of Delaware]] in 1776 made the sheriff a [[conservator of the peace]] within the county in which he resides, either [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]], [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent]], or [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex]]. The sheriff was, and still is, chosen by the citizens of each county at the general elections to serve a four-year term. Per Title 10, Chapter 21 of the Delaware Code, the Sheriff is an officer of the court. Responsibilities include processing orders of the court system; summoning inquests, jurors, and witnesses for the courts; and, conducting execution sales against personal and real estate property. County Sheriffs and their regular appointed deputies also take into custody unincarcerated persons immediately upon conviction of an imprisonable offense and convey them to the appropriate correctional facility to serve their terms. The County Sheriffs and their deputies do not engage in typical law enforcement; their primary role is to provide enforcement services for the courts. Typical law enforcement, such as the enforcement of motor vehicle laws, investigation of crimes and routine policing patrols are performed by state, county, and municipal (town or city) police forces.<ref>[http://delcode.delaware.gov/title10/c021/index.shtml Title 10, Chapter 21, Delaware Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217193216/http://delcode.delaware.gov/title10/c021/index.shtml |date=2007-12-17 }} delaware.gov</ref>\n\n===District of Columbia===\nThere is no appointed or elected Sheriff in the District of Columbia because, as a [[Federal city|Federal City]], it is in a unique and complicated position compared to other jurisdictions in the United States. As the District Government is both an agency of the Federal Government and a duly-elected Local Government under the [[District of Columbia home rule|D.C. Home Rule Act of 1973]], there are many functions which would normally be reserved for the Office of the Sheriff, which are instead delegated to various other agencies. The [[United States Marshals Service|United States Marshal Service]], as an agent of the Federal Government officially handles most court and civil processes in the District of Columbia, while the [[District of Columbia Protective Services Division|District of Columbia Protective Services Police Department]] (PSPD) handles many other functions normally reserved for the Office of the Sheriff on behalf of the elected local government.\n\n===Florida===\n{{main|County sheriff (Florida)}}\n[[Florida]] sheriffs are one of a handful of \"constitutional\" Florida offices; that is, the position was established as part of the Florida State constitution, which specifies their powers and that they be elected in the general ballot. {{citation needed span|date=June 2019|text=They serve as the chief law enforcement officer in their respective counties.}} The sheriff's office is responsible for law enforcement, corrections, and court services within the county. Although each county sheriff's office is an independent agency, they all wear the \"Florida's sheriff green\" uniform with similar badges and patches, and drive vehicles with green and gold designs, as prescribed in Florida State Statutes, with the exception of Duval and Miami-Dade.\nCollier County also does not wear green; they wear a grey uniform with green accents.\n\n====Miami-Dade County====\n[[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] (formerly Dade County) has two directors appointed by its county commission. In Miami-Dade County, the duties of the two appointed directors are split as follows:\n*One director is simultaneously the metropolitan director and the director of public safety. As the director of public safety he/she serves as the chief of the [[Miami-Dade Police Department]] (separate from the [[Miami Police Department|City of Miami Police Department]]).\n*The other director serves in command of corrections (of the [http://www.miamidade.gov/corrections/ Miami-Dade Department of Corrections]) and is charged with the care and custody of prisoners.\n\n====Duval County====\nUpon the [[Consolidated city-county|consolidation]] of [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]] and the [[Jacksonville, Florida|City of Jacksonville]] governments in 1968, the Duval County Sheriff's Department and the Jacksonville Police Department were merged into a single unified law enforcement agency styled the [[Jacksonville Sheriff's Office]] (JSO). Commanded by the elected Sheriff of Duval County, and an appointed senior staff, its 1675 sworn members are referred to as \"police officers\" rather than deputies. All JSO police officers are also deputy sheriffs, in order to perform those duties Florida solely permits \"sheriffs and their deputies\" to perform, such as serving warrants. Similarly, the 800 members of the JSO's Department of Corrections are \"Correctional Officers\". [http://www.jaxsheriff.org/departments/sheriffs-office/sheriff-mike-williams.aspx Michael Williams] is the current Sheriff.\n\nJSO police and corrections uniforms are dark navy blue, with silver devices for police and corrections officers and gold for supervisory and command personnel. Marked JSO vehicles are white with a broad gold stripe on each side with the word \"SHERIFF\" displayed in navy blue on each rear quarter-panel and \"POLICE\" in navy blue on the rear of the vehicle. In 2007, in terms of sworn officers, JSO was the 25th largest local police agency in the US, and the second largest in the state of Florida.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/lpd07.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117113039/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/lpd07.pdf |archivedate=2013-01-17 }}</ref>\n\n====Broward County====\nThe [[Broward County Sheriff's Office|Broward Sheriff's Office]] is currently under the direction of Sheriff [[Gregory Tony]] and is a full-service law enforcement agency. The sheriff has an undersheriff and several district chiefs, also called district commanders. These individuals generally hold the title of \"captain.\" The Broward Sheriff's Office (BSO) also directs and oversees the fire/rescue/EMS operations for the county, referred to Broward County Fire Rescue (BSO or County Fire Rescue). Overseeing the operation of the Fire/Rescue/EMS Division is a fire chief and several deputy chiefs. BSO Fire Rescue serves unincorporated parts of the county as well as municipalities under contract for fire/rescue/EMS. BSO also operates several helicopters that serve a dual purpose. Each helicopter is suited for law enforcement duties as well as medical evacuation (MEDEVAC); the helicopters are staffed both by sworn deputies as well as a flight nurse or flight medic. BSO also has a professional Marine Patrol, motor (cycle) patrol and mounted (horse) patrol. The Broward Sheriff's office also contracts its law enforcement duties to municipalities that either have no local police department or have disbanded the local police department to be incorporated to BSO.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheriff.org|title=Home - Broward Sheriff's Office|website=www.sheriff.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928183146/http://sheriff.org/|archivedate=28 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Georgia===\nSheriffs and his or her deputies and any other state certified peace officer may make an arrest on or off duty only after stating that they are peace officers in the state of Georgia. One of five county officials listed in the state constitution, sheriffs in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] are full-service county officers. Article IX, Section I of the constitution specifies that sheriffs \"shall be elected by the qualified voters of their respective counties for a term of four years and shall have such qualifications, powers and duties as provided by general law.\" However, several metropolitan counties have opted to form a [[county police]] to perform law enforcement functions leaving the sheriff to court functions. Others also have a [[marshal|county marshal]] who provide civil law enforcement. Even with other agencies in the same county, such as county police, the Sheriff is the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of each county. All law enforcement officers in Georgia have statewide jurisdiction if the crime happens in their immediate presence, but sheriffs have statewide jurisdiction also if the crime originated in their county. This means if someone breaks the law in one county and flees to another the sheriff can go anywhere inside the state to investigate the crime, make the arrest, and transport the accused back to the original county.\n\nMost of the qualifications, powers and duties of a sheriff in Georgia are detailed in Title 15, Chapter 16 of state law. Among other things, the law states that \"the sheriff is the basic law enforcement officer of the several counties of this state.\" Section 10 makes it clear that the sheriff has as much authority within municipalities as he does in unincorporated areas of his county, although many sheriffs refrain from performing standard law-enforcement functions within municipalities that have their own police department unless specifically requested to do so, or are required to do so in order to fulfill other provisions in state law.\n\nIn addition to law enforcement, sheriffs or their deputies execute and return all processes and orders of the courts; receive, transport, and maintain custody of incarcerated individuals for court; attend the place or places of holding elections; keep all courthouses, jails, public grounds, and other county property; maintain a register of all precious-metal dealers; enforce the collection of taxes that may be due to the state; as well as numerous other duties.\n\nThe office of Sheriff in Georgia existed in colonial times, and was included in the first official constitution of Georgia in 1777. There is no limit to how many terms a sheriff may serve. Title 15, Chapter 16, Section 40 of Georgia law specifies that, upon reaching 75 years of age, a sheriff who has held that office for 45 or more years automatically holds the honorary office of sheriff emeritus of the State of Georgia.\n\nIn metropolitan counties the sheriff's responsibilities have changed from that of being the sole law enforcement official for their counties, to performing only traditional court-related functions but with wide-ranging duties in coordination with a county police department in the suburbs of the state capital and major cities. When these county police departments were formed they assumed patrol, investigative, crime fighting, and transportation safety responsibilities.\n\nThere are two Georgia counties where the police department in the county seat and the local sheriff's office have merged most of their general operations: the [[Macon-Bibb County Sheriffs Office]] and the Augusta-Richmond County Sheriff's Office.\n\n===Hawaii===\nHawaii has two sheriffs:\n*The Office of Sheriff falls under the [[Hawaii Department of Public Safety#Sheriff Division|Sheriff's Division]] of the [[Hawaii Department of Public Safety]].<ref>[http://www.hawaii.gov/psd/law_home.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011700/http://www.hawaii.gov/psd/law_home.php|date=September 27, 2007}}</ref> It is the functional equivalent of a [[state police]] department and has the distinction of making Hawaii the only [[U.S. state]] without an officially named state police department and one of two with a statewide Sheriff's Department (the other being Rhode Island). Although the Sheriff Division's jurisdiction covers the entire state, its primary functions are judicial and executive protection, security at the [[Hawaii State Capitol]], law enforcement at Hawaii's [[airport]]s, narcotics enforcement, prisoner transportation, the processing and service of court orders and warrants, and the patrol of certain roads and waterways in conjunction with other state agencies.\n*The Sheriff of [[Kalawao County, Hawaii]], located on the [[Kalawao County, Hawaii|Kalaupapa Peninsula]] on the north coast of the island of [[Molokai|Moloka'i]], is selected from among the 147 local residents (147 total population per the [[2000 United States Census]]), by the [[Hawaii Department of Health]], which administers the county. The sheriff is the sole county government employee.\n\n===Idaho===\nThe state of Idaho consists of 44 counties. Each county in Idaho has an elected position for the Office of Sheriff which is the supreme law enforcement of a county. The Office of Sheriff is elected in 4-year terms.\n\n===Illinois===\nIn Illinois, the sheriff is the highest law enforcement authority in each county; however, incorporated [[Municipality|municipalities]], regardless of their sizes, are responsible for primary law enforcement within their jurisdiction. Therefore, the sheriffs' offices generally concentrate their police functions on unincorporated areas. In addition, many small municipalities pay the sheriff's office a portion of their law enforcement funds for the sheriff to act as their primary law enforcement: usually either overnight, which allows the local police department to operate with local officers during the day; or full-time, relieving the village of needing its own police department.\n\nIn addition to providing policing, the sheriff's office controls the [[Prison|county jail]], guards the [[courthouse]], acts as the [[service of process|process server]] for court documents such as [[summons]]es, and oversees [[eviction]]s, even inside municipalities with their own police forces.\n\n====Cook County====\nThe [[Cook County Sheriff's Office]] is the second largest in the United States, with over 6,900 members. Due to its size, the Cook County Sheriff's Office divides its operations by task into 8 departments, the most recognizable of which is the Cook County Sheriff's Court Services Department. The much smaller Cook County Sheriff 's Police Department provides traditional police services in Unincorporated Cook County while the Department of Corrections operates the Cook County Department of Corrections.\n\nAll Cook County Sheriff's Deputies are Sworn and State certified Peace Officers with Police Powers regardless of their particular job function or title. Like other sheriffs' departments in Illinois, the Sheriff can provide all traditional law-enforcement functions, including county-wide patrol and investigations irrespective of municipal boundaries, even in the city of [[Chicago]], but has traditionally limited its police patrol functions to unincorporated areas of the county because unincorporated areas are the primary jurisdiction of a Sheriff's Department in Illinois.\n\nThe Sheriff's Police patrol services are often not required in incorporated cities because the cities such as Chicago have established their own police departments. The 500\u2013600 member Sheriff's Police Department would not have the personnel necessary to supply full police services to all incorporated areas in Cook County especially in a municipality such as Chicago.\n\nSheriff's deputies, outside the Sheriff's Police, provide the other services of the sheriff, such as guarding the various courthouses in Cook County, running and guarding the 9,800-detainee Cook County Jail, and overseeing other offender rehabilitation programs.\n\n===Indiana===\n\n[[File:Bloomfield Indiana Police with Indiana State Police circa 1948.jpg|thumb|185px|right|Greene County, Indiana Sheriff and Deputy Sheriff with the Indiana State Police circa 1940]]\n\nIn [[Indiana]], county sheriffs are elected to office and limited by the [[Constitution of Indiana|state constitution]] to serving no more than two four-year terms consecutively. Indiana sheriffs are empowered to make the [[arrest]] of persons who commit an offense within the sheriff's view, and take them before a court of the county having [[jurisdiction]], and detain them in custody until the cause of the arrest has been investigated. They possess a general power to suppress breaches of the peace, calling the [[Posse comitatus|power of the county]] to the sheriff's aid if necessary; pursue and jail felons; serve and execute judicial process; attend and preserve order in all courts of the county; take care of the county jail and the prisoners there; take photographs, fingerprints, and other identification data as the sheriff shall prescribe of persons taken into custody for felonies or misdemeanors. They are required to provide an accounting to the state department of correction concerning the costs of incarcerating prisoners in the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch13.html|title=Indiana Code 2017 - Indiana General Assembly, 2018 Session|first=Indiana General|last=Assembly|website=www.in.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514154314/http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch13.html|archivedate=14 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nSomewhat unusual among the states, Indiana sheriffs are paid a [[salary]] out of which they must feed the prisoners in the county jails in their charge. They must account for the money they spend on prisoner's food; many counties' agreement with the sheriff's department allows the elected sheriff to keep the remaining funds allocated, which is contrary to state law.<!-- According to the law they are not supposed to, and return the funds to the general fund--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch13.html|title=Indiana Code 2017 - Indiana General Assembly, 2018 Session|first=Indiana General|last=Assembly|website=www.in.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514154314/http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch13.html|archivedate=14 May 2013}}</ref> As a result, in many Indiana counties, the position of sheriff is one of the more lucrative of the elected officials, and the elections for sheriff are frequently hotly contested and draw larger numbers of candidates than most other county elective positions.<ref>See, e.g., {{cite web |url=http://www.washtimesherald.com/local/local_story_255121627.html |title=Martin County Sheriff to get $85,000 in 2007 |accessdate=2006-09-28 |date= 2006-09-16}}</ref>\n\nIndiana Sheriffs may also appoint Special Deputies to act as private [[security police]] for businesses. These Special Deputies are only empowered during the course of their employment hours and do not have any police authority when not actively working. Special Deputies appointed who work for the Sheriff's Department or other municipal or governmental agencies are limited only by any written limitations and specific requirements imposed by the sheriff and signed by the Special Deputy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indy.gov/eGov/County/MCSD/Careers/SpecDep/Pages/home.aspx|title=Special Deputy (Non-MCSO Employees)|last=Indy.gov|website=www.indy.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002071800/http://www.indy.gov/eGov/County/MCSD/Careers/SpecDep/Pages/home.aspx|archivedate=2 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar8/ch10.html|title=Indiana Code 2017 - Indiana General Assembly, 2018 Session|first=Indiana General|last=Assembly|website=www.in.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520220102/http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar8/ch10.html|archivedate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the Indiana Supreme Court appoints a sheriff to maintain the safety of the judiciary and court facilities.

Sheriffs are elected to four-year terms in office with no term limits.  \n \nSheriff's Offices within Iowa have many functions: Patrol \u2013 which is the most visible and provides public safety activities and traffic enforcement duties; Jail \u2013 according to Iowa law, the Sheriff is responsible for the operation of the county jail. This responsibility includes the transportation of prisoners, the guarding of jail facilities, and in some counties, the securing of the county courthouse; Civil \u2013 according to Iowa law, the Sheriff is responsible for the civil process, which includes serving legal documents from the court and conducting evictions, sales and other civil related duties; and Detective \u2013 which investigates crimes and conducts follow up activities on cases.\n\nAlthough a primary responsibility of the Sheriff's Office is to provide law enforcement protection to the unincorporated and rural areas of the county, most Sheriff's Offices contract to provide law enforcement services to smaller incorporated communities that do not have their own police department. \n \nA Sheriff must be a certified peace officer through the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy as required under the Code of Iowa chapter 80B or must complete the basic training course within one year of taking office. Iowa deputy sheriffs are covered by civil service law which ensures that after their probationary periods they are only removed from office for just cause. Deputy Sheriffs must complete the state law enforcement academy within their first year of employment.\n\nIn accordance with state law, the Iowa State Sheriffs' and Deputies' Association establishes the uniform and vehicle standards for all 99 counties. As such, all uniforms and patrol vehicle graphics are the same for each of the 99 Sheriff's Offices throughout Iowa with the exception of the respective County's name appearing on their badges, uniform patches, and vehicle markings. Badge numbers for Sheriffs and Deputies consist of a prefix number, which represents the county number, followed by a one to three digit number, which represents the Sheriff's or Deputy's number within that specific office. The Sheriff's badge number in each county is always #1. So the Sheriff from Bremer County would have an ID number of 9-1 (9 is the county number for Bremer County and 1 is the number for the Sheriff).\n\n===Kansas===\nSheriffs are elected officials in their counties. They serve four-year terms between elections.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sheriffs' The largest sheriffs office in Kansas, is the Sedgwick County Sheriffs office, located in the south central part of the state.History|url=http://kansassheriffs.org/sheriff_history.php|accessdate=17 February 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214015041/http://kansassheriffs.org/sheriff_history.php|archivedate=14 February 2013}}</ref> There are 105 counties in Kansas but only 104 sheriffs. In the 1970s, [[Riley County, Kansas|Riley County]] merged the police departments within the county and created the Riley County Police Department. The RCPD is head by a Director who is hired by a police board. In Riley county, any duties that a county sheriff would perform are carried out by the RCPD. A small number of sheriffs in Kansas contract their police services to cities within their county boundaries that do not wish to manage their own police departments.\n\n===Kentucky===<!-- This section is linked from [[McCreary County, Kentucky]] -->\n[[File:Unfinished portrait of Daniel Boone by Chester Harding 1820.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Daniel Boone 1782 Sherriff of Fayette County Ky]]\nSheriffs in [[Kentucky]] are elected for four-year terms and are not term limited. Sheriffs and deputies in Kentucky have the authority to patrol as well as power of arrest in all areas of their particular county, including incorporated cities. Most sheriffs, however, choose to patrol incorporated cities either only on the request of city officials or in the case of a major emergency. Sheriff's deputies will jointly patrol unincorporated areas of their county with the [[Kentucky State Police]]. In addition, sheriffs in Kentucky are responsible for court security, serving court papers and transporting prisoners. They are also responsible for collecting taxes on real estate and tangible property. Also, Kentucky law states that only the county coroner, also an elected peace officer, can serve the sitting sheriff with a state criminal court process or place him/her under arrest (any peace officer, however, can arrest the coroner).\n\nOne of the main differences between Kentucky sheriffs and sheriffs in other states is that in most counties in Kentucky sheriffs do not run the county jails. County jails are run by a separate elected official called a jailer who has the authority to employ deputy jailers. The sheriff's office, however, may be asked by the jailer to assist with jail security in the event of an emergency. The only exception is in counties containing first class cities or counties with consolidated city/county governments which may merge their offices of sheriff and jailer and retain the office of sheriff to fill both roles. In these cases the sheriff can then relinquish responsibility for the jail back to the county or consolidated government to operate. This is the case in both [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]] and [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]], which are both the only counties with first class cities ([[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] & [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] respectively) and are the only counties with merged city/county governments.\n\nDeputy sheriffs, like municipal police officers, must be trained and certified as peace officers through the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet Law Enforcement Training Center at [[Eastern Kentucky University]] in [[Richmond, Kentucky|Richmond]], unless they have previously completed another recognized police academy. To maintain certification, all certified peace officers must complete forty hours of in-service training annually. Sheriffs themselves, however, are not mandated to be trained and certified as the job requirements for sheriff are described in the [[Kentucky Constitution]], rather than the [[Kentucky Revised Statutes]]. Many sheriffs, however, do choose to receive this training if they had not received it as a law enforcement officer prior to their election.\n\n===Louisiana===\nThe [[Louisiana]] constitution establishes the office of sheriff in each parish, each elected to a term of four years (Const. Art. V, \u00a727). The sheriff is the chief law enforcement officer in the parish and has both criminal and civil jurisdiction. The sheriff is in charge of all criminal investigations and is responsible for executing court orders and process. The sheriff is the collector of [[ad valorem tax]]es and other taxes and license fees as provided by law and is the keeper of the public jail in the parish. Article V, Section 32 provides for the offices of civil sheriff and criminal sheriff in Orleans Parish. ''State & Local Government in Louisiana,'' Chapter 3 ''Local Government,'' Part. II.

Although they have police powers, their duties are to generally support local law enforcement, and they do not usually patrol. The sheriffs in Massachusetts are considered to be the chief law enforcement officers in their counties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/msa/mission-statement.html|title=Mission Statement|date=24 March 2008|publisher=Massachusetts Sheriffs' Association|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515045421/http://www.mass.gov/msa/mission-statement.html|archivedate=15 May 2018}}</ref> In some counties, such as [[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk]], and [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts|Barnstable]], the sheriffs maintain law enforcement services such as K-9, criminal investigation, and tactical response, gang enforcement, and warrant teams. Deputies are often seen supporting local police in traffic control and at large events like county fairs and sports events.\n\n===Michigan===\nIn [[Michigan]], sheriffs are constitutionally mandated, elected county officials. All sheriff's offices have general law enforcement powers throughout their entire county,<ref>But see E. Frank Cornelius, \"The Authority of a Michigan Sheriff To Deny Law Enforcement Powers to a Deputy\", 25 Thomas M. Cooley Law Review, No. 3 (2008), 433-462.</ref> as well as traditional judicial-process, court-protection ([[bailiff]]) and jail-operation powers. Sheriff's offices may primarily patrol areas of their county without municipal police services; however, they are free to patrol anywhere in their county, including [[City|cities]], [[Village|villages]] and [[charter township]]s that have their own police services. Occasionally, this results in conflict over jurisdiction between municipal police agencies and sheriff's offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051212/METRO/512120338/1003|title=Detroit News|author=|date=|website=Detroit News|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn some counties (primarily urban counties such as [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland]], [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb]], [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne]], [[Kent County, Michigan|Kent]], [[Genesee County, Michigan|Genesee]], [[Saginaw County, Michigan|Saginaw]], [[Bay County, Michigan|Bay]], [[Midland County, Michigan|Midland]] and [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw]]), sheriff's offices provide dedicated police services under contract to some municipalities, in lieu of those municipalities providing their own police services.  (Michigan law provides for or requires municipalities, depending upon their structure, to provide dedicated police services.)\n\nThe sheriffs of all 83 Michigan counties are members of the Michigan Sheriffs' Association. This professional organization, formed in 1877, promulgates standardized insignias that are used, to varying degrees, by all Michigan sheriff's offices on their uniforms and vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michigansheriff.com/|title=MichiganSheriff.com|website=www.michigansheriff.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926114528/http://michigansheriff.com/|archivedate=26 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nNotably, the [[Michigan State Police]] have general law-enforcement powers throughout the entire state. Thus, all Michigan residents have at least two levels of general police services (state police and sheriff's offices), while residents of a municipality that has its own police service have a third level of general police service.\n\nThe Office of Sheriff is created by the Michigan Constitution. As a constitutional officer, the Sheriff must operate a county jail, serve and execute all civil writs and process as well as criminal process that are issued pursuant to rule, and produce and maintain records as prescribed by law. In addition, the Sheriff operates a Marine Safety Program (with the Department of Natural Resources), provides contracted law enforcement services, and miscellaneous other duties.\n\nCurrently the [[Oakland County Sheriff's Office]] is the largest full service sheriff's office in the state, overseeing over 1,400 employees and managing an annual budget of over $156 million dollars.\n\n===Minnesota===\n{{expand section|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn order to be elected to the office of County Sheriff, the candidate must be actively employed in a law enforcement vocation. The [[Hennepin County Sheriff's Office]] is the largest Sheriff's office in Minnesota, serving roughly one million residents. <ref>https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2016/11/01/hennepin-county-deputies-leave-pipeline-protest/</ref>\n\n===Mississippi===\nSheriffs in the State of Mississippi are elected to four (4) year terms, with no limits on the number of terms that may be served. The Sheriff's office works to prevent crime and build community safety through education, investigation and enforcement. The sheriff's duties generally fall into two broad categories:\n# Law enforcement duties: These duties are specifically to keep the peace within the county, by causing all offenders to enter into bonds, with sureties, for keeping the peace and for appearing at the next circuit court, and by committing such offenders in case of refusal. The sheriff is also charged with the duty to quell riots, routs, affrays and unlawful assemblages, and to prevent lynchings and mob violence.\n# Administrative duties:\n#* Serve as the county's jailor\u2014The sheriff is required to keep separate rooms for the sexes, not permitting communication between male and female prisoners, unless they are married; provide fire and lights when necessary and proper; sufficient and clean bedding; and daily wholesome and adequate food and drink.\n#* Have charge of the courthouse and jail of his county, of the premises belonging thereto, and of the prisoners in said jail. This includes the protection of the court and prisoners from mob violence, injuries or attacks by mobs, and from trespasses and intruders.\n#* Submit a budget of his office's estimated expenses for the next fiscal year including payment of premiums on the bonds and insurance necessary to protect the interest of the county. (i.e. bonds for liability insurance, insurance against false arrest charges, insurance against false imprisonment charges, theft, fire, and other hazards insurance, and hospitalization insurance).\n#* Keep books of every kind maps, charts, and other things that may be donated to the county.\n#* Keep the Mississippi Department Reports, census reports, statutes of the state, the Mississippi Reports, digests, and legislative journals assigned to his county in the courtroom of the courthouse.\n#* Keep a jail docket noting the details of each warrant or mittimus of any person placed in the county jail.\n\n===Missouri===\nThere are 114 counties and one independent city (City of St. Louis) in Missouri. Sheriffs in Missouri are elected to a four (4) year term. The sheriff and his deputies may conduct a variety of duties within their respective jurisdictions. Section 57.100 of the Missouri Revised Statutes states that \"Every sheriff shall quell and suppress assaults and batteries, riots, routs, affrays and insurrections; shall apprehend and commit to jail all felons and traitors, and execute all process directed to him by legal authority, including writs of replevin, attachments and final process issued by circuit and associate circuit judges.\"\n\nGenerally, the sheriff is responsible for police patrol in unincorporated areas of the county, but retains full jurisdiction within the entire county. Generally, city or village police handle general law enforcement duties in incorporated areas. In addition, the sheriff is responsible for court security, serving court documents, operating the jail (some jurisdictions have separate county correctional departments), executing warrants, issuing concealed weapon carry permits, and other duties. In the Independent City of St. Louis, the sheriff's duties include court security for the Circuit Court, transporting prisoners between the Courts and detention facilities, serving court papers and eviction notices, and issuing concealed carry permits.<ref>City of St. Louis Sheriff website: {{cite web |url=http://stlouis.missouri.org/citygov/sheriff/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526124018/http://stlouis.missouri.org/citygov/sheriff/ |archivedate=2010-05-26 }}</ref> Patrol duties are handled by the City of St. Louis Police Department.\n\nSome sheriff's departments provide School Resource Deputies to public school districts under contract with the local school board. These deputies not only perform law enforcement duties, but act as mentors and instructors in safety and security related matters.\n\nIn addition, sheriffs may utilize SWAT or STAR teams, consisting of specially trained deputies who may handle hostage situations, security details, or special events. K-9 units, boat patrols, air patrols, traffic units, reserve units, and Emergency Management Division units are just some of the other specialized divisions that may be formed by the sheriff.\n\nSince January 1, 2010, Missouri Revised Statutes 57.010 states that county sheriffs must have a Missouri Peace Officer's License before they may perform any law enforcement functions. Deputy Sheriffs are considered law enforcement officers, and must be certified by The Department of Public Safety's [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) Program.\n\n===Montana===\nAll 56 Montana counties have sheriff's offices responsible for general law-enforcement functions in areas other than those covered by local city police departments. In larger cities sheriff's offices perform mainly judicial duties such as serving warrants and providing courtroom security. The sheriff, as the county's chief law enforcement officer, has jurisdiction anywhere in the county, including municipalities, where the Sheriff's Office provides assistance and support to local law enforcement agencies. Sheriff's deputies in Montana are certified by The Department of Public Safety's Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) Program. Sheriff's deputies have the full powers of arrest and can enforce all of state laws more than any other law enforcement officer in the state. Examples include fish and game violations, department of transportation regulations, department of livestock.\n\n===Nebraska===\nAll [[Nebraska]] counties have sheriff's offices responsible for general law-enforcement functions in areas other than those covered by local city police departments. Sheriff's deputies in Nebraska are certified by the state law-enforcement commission and have full arrest powers.\n\n===Nevada===\nThere are 16 sheriff's departments in Nevada, and two of them are unique, as the [[Carson City Sheriff's Office]] is a result of the 1967 merger of the old [[Carson City Police Department]] and the [[Ormsby County Sheriff's Department]], as well as the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department]] which is the result of the 1973 merger of the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department|Clark County Sheriff's Office]] and the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department#History|old Las Vegas Police Department]].\n\n===New Hampshire===\nThe [[New Hampshire]] position of [[High sheriff|High Sheriff]] dates back to pre-Revolutionary War days. Since 1840, there have been 10 [[List of counties in New Hampshire|counties in the state]], each with a High Sheriff.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nh-sheriffs.org |title=New Hampshire Sheriff's Association |website=nh-sheriffs.org |accessdate=March 31, 2020}}</ref> These sheriffs and their deputies are the highest ranking and most powerful uniformed law-enforcement officers in the state. The state constitution gives the sheriff of each county full law-enforcement authority throughout the county. In 1911, this authority was expanded by the [[New Hampshire General Court|state legislature]] to include the entire state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/VII/104/104-6.htm |title=Title VII: Sheriffs, Constables, and Police Officers {{!}} Chapter 104: Sheriffs and Constables {{!}} Section 104:6 |website=gencourt.state.nh.us |accessdate=March 31, 2020}}</ref> Sheriffs are elected to two-year terms without term limits. The sheriff is responsible for patrol duties, civil process, transport of prisoners, and criminal and civil warrants. Most county sheriff's offices provide dispatch service for many of the county's communities. Sheriffs are also responsible for the security in all the [[New Hampshire Superior Court|county courthouses]] throughout the state. Finally, sheriffs are responsible for the prisoners in the [[New Hampshire Circuit Court District Division|local district courts]] throughout the state.\n\n===New Jersey===\nSheriffs in [[New Jersey]] are sworn law-enforcement officers with full arrest powers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njsheriff.org/|title=Sheriffs' Association of New Jersey|website=www.njsheriff.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308042526/http://njsheriff.org/|archivedate=8 March 2018}}</ref> They also serve writs and other legal process and perform court-security functions. In some counties, responsibility for the county jail rests with the sheriff's office; in other counties, this responsibility rests with a separate corrections department. In most counties, the police functions provided by the sheriff's office are limited to patrolling county property such as parks, courts, county facilities, and roads; plus, providing specialized units and support to local police, e.g., [[Bomb disposal|bomb squads]], emergency response ([[SWAT]]) and investigative units. Essex County Sheriff's Bureau of Narcotics is featured in the film ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]'' which stars [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Russell Crowe]]. The [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]] Sheriff and the Hudson County Sheriff, also holds the unique title of the Office of Emergency Management and serves a highly populated urban area including [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], in Essex County, which is New Jersey's largest city and [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], in Hudson County, which is New Jersey's second largest city.\n\nNote: [[Union County, New Jersey|Union County]] also has a separate county-wide police force, which fulfills many of the police functions provided by sheriff's offices in other counties.\n\nAll areas of New Jersey are incorporated municipalities and the vast majority have their own local police agencies that provide general law enforcement. The [[New Jersey State Police]] provides primary law enforcement in only a few rural areas in Southern and North Western NJ that lack local police.\n\n===New Mexico===\nNew Mexico County Sheriffs are regular law enforcement officials and have the authority to perform law enforcement duties at any location within their county of jurisdiction, but they primarily focus on unincorporated rural areas, while leaving law enforcement functions within the limits of incorporated municipalities to town or city police departments. Sheriffs occasionally assist local police departments with law enforcement in incorporated cities and towns, particularly when such assistance is requested by local police.\n\n===New York===\nLike most other states, sheriffs and deputy sheriffs in the State of [[New York (state)|New York]] are regular law-enforcement officers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysheriffs.org/|title=NY Sheriffs Association|website=www.nysheriffs.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309040013/http://nysheriffs.org/|archivedate=9 March 2018}}</ref> with full police powers and duties such as patrol work, prisoner transport, civil process, and court security.<ref>For a detailed list of the duties and rights of Sheriff in N.Y., see N.Y.

Several counties have moved away from these practices. Patrol cars in these counties have different vehicle markings, and deputy sheriffs wear different uniforms. Some examples are [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]], which has dark gray uniforms similar to the New York State Police; and [[Warren County, New York|Warren County]], whose deputy sheriffs wear tan shirts with dark brown pants. [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]] Deputy Sheriffs wear tactical Class B uniforms consisting of black shirts and black pants and a Class A uniform with light blue shirts with darker blue pants. In [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]], the sheriff vehicles are black and white (similar to the police/sheriff vehicle scheme used in California). In [[New York City]], deputy sheriffs wear a uniform very similar to sworn [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] personnel. [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] Sheriff's deputies wear the traditional uniform; black pants, black shirt with brass buttons, and a black stetson.\n\nCurrently there are 57 county sheriff's offices, and one city sheriff's office (see below) which covers the five boroughs (counties) of New York City. The largest sheriff's office in New York State is the [[Erie County Sheriff's Office (New York)|Erie County Sheriff's Office]], followed by the [[Suffolk County Sheriff's Office|Suffolk County Sheriff's Department]] with around 275 deputies and 900 correction officers.\n\nSheriffs in New York State (outside of New York City, Nassau and Westchester Counties) are elected for three or four-year terms, depending on the vote of the county government, specifically the county legislature. The Sheriff of New York City is appointed by the mayor (see below) and the Sheriffs of Nassau County and Westchester County are appointed by the county executives of those respective counties.<ref>N.Y.

The Office of the Sheriff is the primary law enforcement agency for the unincorporated areas of North Carolina's counties. The Sheriff, as the county's chief law enforcement officer, has jurisdiction anywhere in the county, including municipalities, where the Sheriff's Office provides assistance and support to local law enforcement agencies.\n\nLaw enforcement duties of this Office include patrolling the counties, preventing crime, investigating violations of the law, and apprehending law violators. In addition, support services, such as communications, evidence, and property control services are provided. The Sheriff is also responsible for keeping and maintaining the common jail of the county, which currently consists of separate detention facilities at the County Public Safety Centers and the Detention Annex if required by the counties. The Office is responsible for transporting prisoners for court appearances.\n\nIn the area of judicial services, the Office of the Sheriff serves as the enforcement arm of the [[:Category:North Carolina state courts|North Carolina General Court of Justice]].<ref>The North Carolina General Court of Justice consists of three divisions: appellate, superior court, and district court.</ref> The Office serves civil and criminal processes issued by the courts, which often includes arresting persons and bringing them before the courts, as well as the seizure and sale of personal and real property to satisfy court judgments. The Sheriff is responsible for courtroom security in the District and Superior courtrooms in the county.\n\nOther miscellaneous duties of the Office mandated by the State include pistol purchase permits, concealed handgun permits, parade and picketing permits, and maintaining [[Sex offender registries in the United States|registries of sexual offenders]] and domestic violators.\n\nIn North Carolina, the sheriff is elected to a 4-year term, and may not be a [[felony|felon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Legislation/constitution/article7.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-06 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208093558/http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Legislation/constitution/article7.html |archivedate=2012-02-08 }}</ref>  A county sheriff is responsible not to county authorities but to the citizens of the county. County governments are responsible for providing funding to the Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe Sheriff of the NC county is the highest ranking law enforcement officer in each of the state's 100 counties and has complete at-will power to hire and terminate personnel at his-her will and pleasure. Deputies and jailers serve a term concurrent with the sheriff, not to exceed 4 years and must be re-sworn every 4 years. Jailers are custodial officers and must complete a 160-hour jailer training course, though some are also dually trained and sworn as deputies. Deputies must complete the state mandated 600+ hour Basic Law Enforcement Training (BLET) course, or do a \"re-entry\" or reentry syllabus for former or lateral (out of state officers). Other than the reentry option, the training for deputies is the same as for police officers, and other peace officers to be certified. The sheriff however, can hire deputies and has one year to get them trained and certified. This allows a sheriff who comes in office to, if he-she chooses, to replace an entire or partial department with untrained appointees and there is then one year to get the new deputies trained and certified. Deputies are a political extension of the sheriff and have no independent statutory power and when an arrest or action is made in an official capacity, it is done in the name of the sheriff as a de facto power of attorney. This is why legally, a sheriff, unlike a police chief, can dismiss arrests and charges filed by deputies for any or no reason, and this is done frequently for political purposes, Police chiefs cannot do so, as the officers are a separate and distinct legal entity named in legislation,\n\nExceptions to the County Sheriff in North Carolina are that of two of North Carolina's Counties, Gaston and Mecklenburg.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.co.gaston.nc.us/gastonpd/index.htm |title=Archived copy of Gaston County Police Department|accessdate=2007-11-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218064158/http://www.co.gaston.nc.us/gastonpd/index.htm |archivedate=2007-12-18 }}</ref> These Counties have police forces for the whole county, as well as a Sheriff Department that is responsible for the jails, courts and civil process, in addition to gun permits, sex offender database and other specific sheriff duties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.co.gaston.nc.us/sheriff |title=Archived copy of Gaston County Sheriff's Department |accessdate=2008-06-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501211909/http://www.co.gaston.nc.us/sheriff/ |archivedate=2008-05-01 }}</ref>\n* In Gaston County, the [[Gaston County Police Department]] is responsible for county-wide police services for the incorporated and unincorporated areas of the county, while overlapping with City and Township police.

The first Sheriff on the record in Ohio and the [[Northwest Territory]] was Colonel [[Ebenezer Sproat]], who served fourteen years in the position. When he was appointed in 1788, Colonel Sproat's jurisdiction covered all of Washington County; this enormous area of land then included all of eastern Ohio from the Ohio River to Lake Erie. The \"First to Serve Since 1788\" motto on Ohio sheriff vehicles refers to Sheriff Sproat's service.\n\nAfter statehood, only three public offices in Ohio were filled via the electoral-process system. The position of Sheriff was one of them. Through this new system, William Skinner became the first elected Sheriff in the Buckeye State. Since the early 19th century, Ohio sheriffs have been elected at the county level for four-year terms.\n\nIn each of the 88 counties of Ohio, the sheriff is the chief law-enforcement officer. The primary duties of the sheriff are to provide common pleas court services and corrections on a countywide basis, and full police protection to the unincorporated areas of the county; however, the sheriff also maintains full police jurisdiction in all municipalities, townships, and villages. Each sheriff is also statutorily required to provide line law enforcement, court security and service of papers, jail operations, extradition process, and transportation of prisoners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buckeyesheriffs.org|title=Buckeye State Sheriffs' Association|website=www.buckeyesheriffs.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413130709/https://www.buckeyesheriffs.org/|archivedate=13 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn an effort to become consistent on a statewide level, Ohio sheriffs and deputies wear a standardized uniform, and all patrol vehicles are marked in the same manner.\n\n===Oklahoma===\n[[Oklahoma]]'s [[Government of Oklahoma#The County Sheriff|Sheriffs]], whose primary role is as an [[officer of the court]], provide full services, that is, providing traditional law-enforcement functions such as countywide patrol and investigations. As the chief peace officer of each of Oklahoma's 77 counties, the Sheriffs serve and execute all process, writs, precepts and orders issued or made by lawful authorities, namely the courts. The Sheriff's office also provides security for judges and courthouses. The Sheriffs are in charge of and have custody over the jail of their county, and all the prisoners in the jail are under the Sheriff's supervision, with the Sheriff serving as the county's jailer.\n\nUnder their law-enforcement responsibilities, the Sheriffs are responsible for ensuring that the peace is preserved, [[riot]]s are suppressed, and that unlawful assemblies and [[insurrection]]s are controlled throughout their county. To ensure justice is administered, the Sheriff is empowered to apprehend any person charged with a felony or breach of the peace and may attend any court within the county. The Sheriffs are also [[Posse comitatus (common law)|empowered]] to [[conscription|conscript]] any person or persons of their county that they may deem necessary to fulfill their duties.\n\n===Oregon===\nGeneral duties of sheriff\n\nThe sheriff is the chief executive officer and conservator of the peace of the county. In the execution of the office of sheriff, it is the sheriff's duty to:\n\n(1) Arrest and commit to prison all persons who break the peace, or attempt to break it, and all persons guilty of public offenses.\n\n(2) Defend the county against those who, by riot or otherwise, endanger the public peace or safety.\n\n(3) Execute the process and orders of the courts of justice or of judicial officers, when delivered to the sheriff for that purpose, according to law.\n\n(4) Execute all warrants delivered to the sheriff for that purpose by other public officers, according to law.\n\n(5) Attend, upon call, the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Oregon Tax Court, circuit court, justice court or county court held within the county, and to obey its lawful orders or directions. [Amended by 1985 c.339 \u00a71]\n\nThere are 36 counties in Oregon with 36 elected sheriffs, each holding a four-year term of office. Sheriffs in Oregon provide full-service law enforcement, enforcing all state and local laws, maintaining active traffic safety and enforcement units, managing the county jail, providing marine boating safety patrols, being responsible for county Search and Rescue, and providing law enforcement services for the courts. Many Oregon sheriffs have dedicated specialized teams that include traffic safety, SWAT, interagency drug teams, K9, and rescue.\n\n===Pennsylvania===\n[[Pennsylvania]] sheriffs legally have all traditional law enforcement powers. But, since the establishment of the [[Pennsylvania State Police]] in 1905, in practice most of the 67 counties' sheriff's offices perform traditional court-related functions, transporting prisoners to and from court, etc.\n\nThe status of Pennsylvania's county sheriffs was in a legal gray area for many years. While sheriffs routinely provided court security, prisoner transport, civil process services and bench warrant arrests, it was unclear whether they had law-enforcement powers. From the 1970s through the early 1990s, a number of defendants charged by deputy sheriffs with crimes attempted to [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Exclusionary rule|suppress]] the results of their arrests, on the basis that the deputies were not ''bona fide'' law-enforcement officers.\n\nIn ''Commonwealth of Pennsylvania vs. Leet'', a 1991 decision by the Pennsylvania Superior Court, a 2\u20131 majority of the Court held that deputy sheriffs had no law-enforcement powers. That decision was reversed by the [[Supreme Court of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Supreme Court]] in a 1994 decision by Justice John P. Flaherty. He held that sheriffs have  the power to enforce motor-vehicle laws (at issue in this case) for violations committed in their presence. In his majority opinion, Justice Flaherty explored the historical roots of the office of Sheriff in the United Kingdom and the United States and concluded that the powers developed as a matter of [[common law]]:\n\n{{quote|Though it may be unnecessary to cite additional authority, [[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Blackstone]] confirms the common-law power of the sheriff to make arrests without warrant for felonies and for breaches of the peace committed in his presence. Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Common Law,'' Vol. IV, at 289. Indeed, such powers are so widely known and so universally recognized that it is hardly necessary to cite authority for the proposition. To make the point, how few children would question that the infamous [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] had at least the authority to arrest [[Robin Hood]].}}\n\nSheriffs and their deputies in Pennsylvania can therefore make [[arrests]] for felonies and breaches of the peace committed in their presence. They are required by statute to be trained and certified by the [http://www.pccd.state.pa.us Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency].\n\nIn the early 21st century, every Pennsylvania county has a Sheriff's Office. Most are still elected, but [[Northampton County, Pennsylvania|Northampton]] and [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne]] counties have adopted [[home rule]] charters that stipulate the Sheriff will be an appointed position and no longer elected. This has led to some overlap in places such as [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]], where the [[Allegheny County Police Department|County Police]] are responsible for supporting local law-enforcement and patrolling county-owned property, including the [[Pittsburgh International Airport]].\n\nSimilarly, the [[Delaware County Courthouse and Park Police Department]] provides [[security police]] functions. With the newly reestablished law enforcement powers of the [[Sheriff|County Sheriff]], however, this has led to some power struggles.\n\n====Philadelphia County====\nAs part of the government of the [[Philadelphia|City of Philadelphia]], which encompasses the county, the Sheriff is elected<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seventy.org/hot-topics/-2007-election-information/upcoming-election-information/Philadelpiha|title=election information from the Committee of Seventy|author=|date=|website=seventy.org|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref> for a four-year term. The Sheriff provides basic court-related services such as transporting prisoners, providing courthouse security, and other duties with regard to service of process and summonses that are issued by county and state courts. The sheriff also often conducts auction sales of real property in foreclosure in many jurisdictions. The office is often also empowered to conduct seizures of [[personal property]] (chattel) to satisfy a judgment. The [[Philadelphia]] Sheriff's Department has indicated its intention to carry out community law-enforcement while continuing its statutory duties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phillysheriff.com/|title=Home|website=www.phillysheriff.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231231825/https://phillysheriff.com/|archivedate=31 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Rhode Island===\nThe [[Rhode Island Division of Sheriffs]] is a statewide law enforcement agency under the Department of Public Safety.

The sheriff shall keep and preserve the peace within his county, for which purpose he is empowered to call to his aid such persons or power of his county as he may deem necessary. He must pursue and apprehend all felons, and must execute all writs, warrants, and other process from any court or magistrate which shall be directed to him by legal authority.\" Every county in the state of South Dakota is required to hold an election for Sheriff every 4 (four) years. There is no limit to how many consecutive 4 (four) year terms an individual can serve as Sheriff. Sheriff Departments in South Dakota typically rely on the assistance of the South Dakota Highway Patrol for SWAT and high risk warrant services. The Sheriff in all counties has law enforcement powers, they also serve court documents both civil and criminal, provide courthouse security, conduct investigations, and usually operate a county jail. Some counties contract-out jail space for other counties to use. (Fees are usually determined by the number of inmates housed per day.) Sheriffs are required by state law to be paid a minimum annual salary. The law and guidelines are shown below. Sheriffs' salary schedule. The board of county commissioners shall establish, by resolution, the salary payable to the sheriff. The salary payable may not be less than the following schedule based upon the most recent decennial federal census of population of counties.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| County population || Salary schedule\n|-\n| Below 10,000 || $35,700\n|-\n| 10,000\u201314,999 || $38,700\n|-\n| 15,000\u201324,999 || $39,900\n|-\n| 25,000\u201369,999 || $44,700\n|-\n| 70,000 and over || $48,600\n|}\n \nThe board of county commissioners may not decrease the salary of the sheriff during consecutive terms of office of the sheriff.

In all Tennessee counties except one, the sheriff is an official with full police powers, county-wide, although Tennessee sheriffs and their deputies generally perform the patrol portion of their duties in unincorporated areas of their counties if the municipalities have their own police departments. The exception to the rule is [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]]. In Davidson County, the sheriff has the primary responsibility of serving civil process and jail functions without the [[common law]] powers to keep the peace. Protection of the peace is instead the responsibility of the [[Metropolitan Nashville Police Department]] under the county's [[consolidated city-county|Metropolitan Charter]]. The Metropolitan Charter did not remove the Davidson County Sheriff's status as a Law Enforcement officer however. It is simply not his or her primary function as it was prior to the consolidation of the City of Nashville and Davidson County.\n[[File:Knox County Sheriffs Office (3580515538).jpg|thumb|right|[[Knox County, Tennessee]] sheriff's vehicle]]\n\n===Texas===\nThe [[Constitution of Texas|Texas]] [[Constitution]] (Article 5, Section 23) provides for the election of a sheriff in each one of the 254 counties.

The sheriff must be a Utah State Certified Peace Officer when elected or must be certified shortly after the election. All peace officers in Utah are certified by the Utah Peace Officer's Academy, known as POST (Peace Officer Standardization and Training). The sheriffs are responsible to protect the courts, with bailiffs employed for that purpose. They also operate the jail within their county, with corrections officers. Sheriff's deputies provide routine law enforcement services to the unincorporated portions of the county and are considered police officers.\n\nA portion of the sheriff's office carries out civil process at the direction of the courts. All Utah State Certified Peace Officers have authority to arrest throughout the State of Utah. They may also arrest outside the state, for crimes committed within the state.

Sheriffs terms are for four years and are not term limited. Unlike other states, the Sheriff is not necessarily the chief law enforcement officer; in a city that has a police department, a Chief of Police has that distinction according to statute. However, a sheriff is chief law enforcement officer in any county. In such areas, the [[Chief of Police]] is the highest-ranking officer, such as in incorporated towns or cities.\n\nVirginia is unique in that all cities are independent jurisdictions and are completely separate from any county. Thus, most cities (with few exceptions such as Poquoson and Franklin) have elected sheriffs, most of which focus on court and jail operations. By law, sheriffs can enforce all the laws of the Commonwealth in the jurisdiction they serve. Some city sheriffs (such as Portsmouth and Newport News) also work alongside the city police in responding to calls and enforcing traffic violations.\n\nIn cities such as Poquoson and Franklin, these cities grew out of a county and still use that county's sheriff for civil process and court services. Those sheriff's offices still have concurrent jurisdiction in those cities but do not generally exercise them, allowing the city police to handle criminal/traffic matters.\n\nAll sheriffs are responsible for civil process, jails, serving levies and holding sheriff's sales to satisfy judgements.\n\nSince 1983, when the General Assembly passed legislation allowing counties to establish police departments by referendum, only seven counties have done so. In most of those counties, such as Henrico and Chesterfield, the sheriffs offices exercise criminal enforcement authority sharing it with the county police, but generally let the county police investigate most crime.\n\nThe city of Williamsburg incorporated as a city from James City County in 1699. Prior to 1983, the sheriff's office handled all police functions for James City County while a sheriff performed court/jail functions for Williamsburg. When James City County established its county police department, that department operated under the county sheriff for two years before becoming a separate agency. Williamsburg's sheriff's office comprised only 8 personnel, it eventually merged with the county's sheriff's office to form the Williamsburg-James City County Sheriff's office.\n\nIn the early 1990s the General Assembly mandated the uniforms for all sheriffs as being dark brown shirts with tan pants that have a brown stripe. Sheriff's Office vehicles were to be dark brown with a five-point star on the front doors and \"Sheriff's Office\" on the trunk. The five-point star must have the jurisdiction's name in a half circle on the star and \"Sheriff's Office\" in a half circle under that.\n\nIn the early first decade of the 21st century, legislation was passed to allow sheriffs to purchase white vehicles (if agreed to by the city or county), and allowing sheriffs' deputies to wear any color uniform the sheriff chose. Sheriffs' vehicles still must have the star on the front doors and markings on the trunk as before.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office, in conjunction with local police departments, assist with controlling traffic, issuing traffic summonses, and working with state and local law-enforcement agencies. Additionally, sheriff's deputies aid the [[county police]], the United States Marshals Service, and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in a joint [[fugitive task force]] that provides apprehension and arrest of felons who face current warrants. Sheriffs and police also share the responsibility of executing detention orders for those who are ordered to receive mental health care, but if the subject is being transported, frequently the jurisdiction\u2019s deputies will conduct the transport. \n\nThere is no distinction made by title, all those who work for a sheriff are deputies. All deputies and police officers must meet state certification standards as set by DCJS (Department of Criminal Justice Services).\n\nBy law, sheriffs are not elected at the same time. County sheriffs are sworn into office on even-numbered years; city sheriffs are sworn into office on odd-numbered years. All deputies must be re-sworn after each election. Sheriffs have complete authority to hire and fire as they see fit; deputy sheriffs serve at the sole pleasure of the sheriff. Sheriff's offices are completely funded by the state, unless a county or city wishes to supplement with funding.\n\n===Washington===\nIn [[Washington (state)|Washington]], each sheriff of the thirty-nine counties is an elected official serving a four-year term.\n\nThe voters of Pierce County voted to pass Charter Amendment 1 on November 7, 2006, to change the sheriff's position from appointed to elected. The first sheriff's election in 30 years was held in 2008.\n[[File:Skagit County Sheriff's Office (17612388133).jpg|thumb|right|[[Skagit County, Washington]] sheriff's vehicle]]\nThe sheriff is the chief law-enforcement officer of a county and is empowered to enforce the criminal laws of the State of Washington and the county their office represents, as well as to serve (once the sheriff has received adequate payment for services rendered) or execute civil processes (such as court orders, evictions, property foreclosures, tax warrants) after payment has been made to the civil division of the county sheriff's office [https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=36.18.040]; to maintain county jails; to provide courthouse security; and to provide general law enforcement in unincorporated areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.28|title=Chapter 36.28 RCW: COUNTY SHERIFF|website=apps.leg.wa.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20071118051114/http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.28|archivedate=18 November 2007}}</ref> In many cities, police services are contracted to the sheriff's department in lieu of a city police department.\n\nThe [[King County Sheriff's Office|King County Sheriff]] is the largest sheriff office in the state. The sheriff in this county, however, has no jurisdiction over the King County Jail as it was separated from his or her control.\n\n===West Virginia===\nIn [[West Virginia]], the sheriff of a given [[County (United States)|county]] performs two distinct duties. They are the chief law-enforcement officers in the county, although much of this duty is handled by their chief deputies. They are also responsible for the collection of any taxes due to the county. While many sheriffs have a background in professional law enforcement, others are politicians or other local notables.

He achieved early success in his native country, where he played with the [[Kintetsu Buffaloes]] from {{Baseball year|1990}} to {{Baseball year|1994}}. He then exploited a loophole to free himself from his contract, and became the first Japanese major leaguer to permanently relocate to MLB in the United States, debuting with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in {{Baseball year|1995}}. Although not the first Japanese person to play baseball professionally in the US, Nomo is often credited with opening the door for [[List of Japanese players in Major League Baseball|Japanese players in MLB]], due to his star status.<ref>[http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080717&content_id=3145811&vkey=news_la&fext=.jsp&c_id=la Nomo retires from baseball | dodgers.com: News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNomo pitched over a span of 13 seasons in the American major leagues with 8 different teams, before retiring in {{Baseball year|2008}}. In 1995, he won the [[National League]] (NL) [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] and was named an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]]. He twice led MLB in [[strikeout]]s and also threw two [[no-hitter]]s. He was the only Japanese pitcher in MLB to throw a no-hitter until the [[Seattle Mariners]]' [[Hisashi Iwakuma]] did so on August 12, 2015, against the [[Baltimore Orioles]].<ref>[https://www.sbnation.com/2015/8/12/9145279/hisashi-iwakuma-no-hitter-mariners-orioles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNomo was well known for his distinctive \"tornado\" [[Pitching position|pitching windup and delivery]]. In 2014, Nomo was inducted into the [[Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame]]. He currently resides in [[Los Angeles, California]].\n\n==Early life==\nNomo was born in [[Minato-ku, Osaka]], Japan, into the working-class family of Shizuo, a [[fisherman]] and [[postal worker]], and Kayoko, a part-time [[supermarket]] employee. As a youth, Nomo was shy and withdrawn, although passionate about baseball. He developed his corkscrew-style pitching motion in order to impress his father while playing [[catch (game)|catch]]. He believed that rotating from having his back turned to his target would help him add speed to his pitches.<ref name=loophole>{{cite news |last1=Whiting |first1=Robert |title=Contract loophole opened door for Nomo's jump |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2010/10/10/baseball/japanese-baseball/contract-loophole-opened-door-for-nomos-jump/ |accessdate=2 November 2015 |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=October 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\nNomo graduated from Seijo Industrial High School in Osaka where he grew to {{convert|188|cm|ftin}} and {{convert|91|kg|lb}}. However, he was not selected in the [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] draft due to issues with his control. Instead, in 1988, Nomo joined Shin-Nittetsu Sakai, an Industrial League team representing [[Nippon Steel]]'s branch in [[Sakai, Osaka]]. During this time, Nomo slept with a [[tennis ball]] taped between his fingers in order to perfect his [[forkball]] grip.<ref name=loophole />\n\n==Success in Nippon Professional Baseball==\nNomo honed his forkball and his control while pitching in the Industrial League. At the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], Nomo played for the [[silver medal]]-winning [[Japan national baseball team|Japanese baseball team]] and the [[Kintetsu Buffaloes]] drafted him in {{Baseball year|1989}}. Nomo debuted with them in 1990 and was an immediate success, going 18\u20138 but more impressively striking out 287 hitters in just 235 [[inning]]s. The strikeout numbers were attributed to his unorthodox wind-up, where he turned his back to the hitter, raised his pivot leg, and paused for a second before throwing. The delivery increased his pitch speed and made it more difficult for batters to spot the ball coming out of his hand. The windup gave him the nickname \"Tornado.\"<ref name=loophole /> Nomo won the [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] that year.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Triple_Crown#Nippon_Professional_Baseball_2</ref>\n\nIn his first four seasons, Nomo was as consistent, and consistently good, as any pitcher in [[Professional baseball in Japan|Japanese baseball]], [[Win (baseball)|winning]] 17 or 18 games each year. His fifth season in 1994 was marred by a shoulder injury and netted him only eight wins. Nomo's forkball became famous for being unpredictable for hitters and catchers alike.\n\n==Moving to the United States==\nNomo had become one of the most popular baseball players in Japan but after the 1994 season, Nomo got into a contract dispute with team management. The Buffaloes rebuffed Nomo's demands to have a contract agent and multi-year contract. Because he was drafted by Kintetsu, the Buffaloes retained exclusive rights to Nomo; however, Nomo's agent, [[Don Nomura]], found a [[loophole]] in the Japanese Uniform Players Contract to enable him to become a [[free agent]]. The \"voluntary retirement clause\" allowed a player who retired to play for whomever he wished after returning to active status.<ref name=loophole /> This led to him heading to the U.S., where in February 1995, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed him.\n\nNomo made his U.S. pro baseball debut with the [[Bakersfield Blaze]] on April 27, 1995, against the [[Rancho Cucamonga Quakes]]. Placed on a 90-pitch limit, and throwing mainly [[fastball]]s, Nomo pitched 5\u2153 innings, taking the 2\u20131 [[Loss (baseball)|loss]] against the Quakes. On May 2, after a month in the [[Minor league baseball|minors]] necessitated by [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|a player's strike]], he became the first [[List of Japanese players in Major League Baseball|Japanese-born Major Leaguer]] to appear in a major league game since [[Masanori Murakami]] in {{Baseball year|1965}}. He was also the first Japanese-born player to relocate permanently to the American major leagues, as Murakami played only two seasons with the [[San Francisco Giants]] and then returned to the Japanese major leagues for the remainder of his career. The pressure on Nomo would be tremendous, and Japanese media and fans appeared in large numbers in games he started. Nomo's games were regularly broadcast live to Japan, despite the fact most people would be waking up when he started games.\n\n==Career in Major League Baseball==\n\n===1995\u20131997===\nThe tornado delivery that baffled batters in Japan had the same effect on major league hitters, and he led the league in strikeouts in 1995 (while finishing second in [[Base on balls|walks]]) and was second with a 2.54 [[Earned run average|ERA]]. He struck out 11.101 batters per 9 innings to break [[Sandy Koufax]]'s single-season franchise record of 10.546 in {{Baseball year|1962}}.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/LAD/leaders_pitch.shtml</ref> He also started that year's [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], striking out three of the six batters he faced. He topped out at 93&nbsp;mph in that game. But he only barely won NL Rookie of the Year honors that year over future [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|MVP]] [[Chipper Jones]], as many voters felt that his Japanese success made him anything but a rookie, although he qualified by Major League rules. Nomo had another fine season in {{Baseball year|1996}} which was capped by a no-hitter thrown on September 17 in the unlikeliest of places, [[Denver, Colorado|Denver's]] [[Coors Field]], a park notoriously known as being a hitters' park because of its high elevation, semi-arid climate, and lack of [[Foul ball|foul territory]]. Nomo's no-hitter remains as the only one in Coors Field, and was the last Dodger to throw a no-hitter until [[Josh Beckett]] completed one on May 25, 2014.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moore |first1=Jack |title=Throwback Thursday: Hideo Nomo Defies The Odds For A Coors Field No-No |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vva57d/throwback-thursday-hideo-nomo-defies-the-odds-for-a-coors-field-no-no |website=Vice |accessdate=15 August 2019 |date=17 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/gallery/featured/GAL1137746/13/26/index.htm |work=CNN |title=Most Popular |accessdate=May 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202041010/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/gallery/featured/GAL1137746/13/26/index.htm |archivedate=December 2, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nNomo also found commercial success in America. Nomo had a signature sneaker, called the [[Air Max]] Nomo, produced by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] in 1996. Also, he appeared on a [[Segata Sanshiro]] commercial for the [[Sega Saturn]] in 1997.\n\nAs batters caught on to his delivery, his effectiveness waned a bit in {{Baseball year|1997}}, although he still went 14\u201312, joining [[Dwight Gooden]] as the only other pitcher to strike out at least 200 batters in each of his first three seasons.\n\n===1998\u20132000===\nNomo pitched poorly in {{Baseball year|1998}}, starting the season 2\u20137 and was dealt to the [[New York Mets]]. His performance did not improve and was released that season. In {{Baseball year|1999}}, he signed with the [[Chicago Cubs]] and made three starts for their Triple-A minor league team before refusing to make further starts in the minors, and received a contract with the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], where he went 12\u20138 with a 4.54 ERA. He reached the 1,000 strikeout mark in 1999, the third fastest in major league history. The Brewers waived him after contract issues and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] claimed him, then granted him [[free agent|free agency]] only 24 hours later after more contract issues. Finally signed by the [[Detroit Tigers]] in {{Baseball year|2000}}, he went 8\u201312 with a 4.74 ERA and was again released.\n\n===2001\u20132003===\nNomo signed with the [[Boston Red Sox]] in {{Baseball year|2001}} and started the season in spectacular fashion, throwing his second no-hitter in his Sox debut, on April 4, against the [[Baltimore Orioles]], walking three and striking out 11. This no-hitter was the first in the 10-year history of [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] and made Nomo the first Red Sox to pitch a no-hitter since [[Dave Morehead]] in {{Baseball year|1965}}. Nomo also became just the fourth player in baseball history to have thrown a no-hitter in both leagues (joining [[Cy Young]], [[Jim Bunning]] and [[Nolan Ryan]]. [[Randy Johnson]] would later join them, becoming the fifth player after throwing a [[Randy Johnson's perfect game|perfect game]] in 2004). It is the earliest, calendar-wise, that a Major League Baseball no-hitter has been pitched. Nomo also led the league in strikeouts for the first time since his first season in MLB.\n\nA free agent after the end of the year, Nomo returned to the Dodgers, in {{Baseball year|2002}}. He ended up having his best season since 1996, posting a 16\u20136 record, 193 strikeouts, and 3.39 ERA. The following year, he had another great season, going 16\u201313 with 177 K and a 3.09 ERA. During September {{Baseball year|2003}}, however, he began to exhibit signs of injury and fatigue.\n\n===2004\u20132008===\n[[File:HideoNomo.png|thumb|Nomo pitching for Tampa Bay in 2005]]\nNomo began to struggle again in {{Baseball year|2004}}. After undergoing shoulder surgery in October 2003, he was benched after going 4\u201311 with an 8.25 ERA for the Dodgers (the worst ERA in the history of baseball for a player with at least 15 decisions in a season).\n\nBefore the start of [[spring training]] for {{Baseball year|2005}}, he signed a $800,000 contract with the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]]. The contract also included a $700,000 incentive that kicked in if Nomo started 20 games. The stipulation was allegedly included because Devil Rays upper management was unsure if Nomo had fully recovered from his injury. After a poor start in which he posted a 7.24 ERA, he was released on July 25. Coincidentally or not, this was two days before he was slated to make his twentieth major league start. On July 27, Nomo was picked up off waivers by the [[New York Yankees]], who signed him to a minor league contract, but never recalled him. Nomo was signed to a minor league contract by the [[Chicago White Sox]] during spring training in {{Baseball year|2006}} to play for the Triple-A [[Charlotte Knights]] of the [[International League]], but the White Sox released him on June 7 of that year.\n\nIn {{Baseball year|2007}}, Nomo signed on with the [[Leones del Caracas]] of the [[Venezuelan Winter League]], managed by his former catcher, [[Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez (catcher)|Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez]]. His participation in the Venezuelan league was viewed as a first step toward an eventual Major League comeback. He made his debut on October 20, 2007, against Tiburones de La Guaira. Nomo pitched one inning, allowing one [[Hit (baseball)|hit]] and no [[Run (baseball)|runs]].\n\nOn January 4, {{Baseball year|2008}}, Nomo signed a [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] contract for 2008 with the [[Kansas City Royals]]. If added to the roster Nomo would have received a $600,000 one-year contract and the chance to earn $100,000 in performance bonuses.<ref>http://www.kansascity.com/sports/royals/story/430041.html</ref> On April 5, his contract was bought by the Royals and was added to the 25-man roster. On April 10, Nomo made his first major league appearance since 2005. He faced the New York Yankees in relief. He was brought in to start the seventh inning of a game while the Yankees were leading 4-1. Nomo loaded the bases, but was able to retire his native countryman, [[Hideki Matsui]], to strand all three runners. However, he later surrendered back-to-back homers to [[Alex Rodriguez]] and [[Jorge Posada]] in the ninth inning. On April 20, Nomo was designated for assignment.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080420&content_id=2558546&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb Nomo designated for assignment]</ref> The Royals released him on April 29, 2008. On July 17, 2008, Nomo officially announced his retirement from Major League Baseball.\n\n==Post playing career==\nPrior to the 2016 season, the [[San Diego Padres]] hired Nomo as Advisor for Baseball Operations, to assist the club with player development and expand their international profile.<ref>{{cite web |first=Corey |last=Brock |title=Padres hire Nomo as baseball ops advisor |url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/164272574/hideo-nomo-joins-padres-as-an-advisor/ |website=MLB.com |date=February 11, 2016 |accessdate=November 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Corey |last=Brock |title=Nomo eager to broaden Padres' Pacific Rim presence |url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/165848594/hideo-nomo-makes-his-mark-in-padres-camp/ |website=MLB.com |date=March 1, 2016 |accessdate=November 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Playing style==\nWith an overhand delivery, Nomo threw a fastball topping out at 95&nbsp;mph and a [[forkball]] as his primary pitches.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/02/sports/baseball-dodgers-cut-nomo-loose-and-will-try-to-trade-him.html BASEBALL; Dodgers Cut Nomo Loose And Will Try to Trade Him] The New York Times</ref>\n\n== Accomplishments ==\nNomo earned 123 wins in the Major Leagues and 78 in Japan, winning his 200th overall game on June 15, 2005. Nomo's success helped inspire other stars from Japan such as [[Ichiro Suzuki]], [[Hideki Matsui]], and [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]] to come over to the States as well.\n\nIn addition, Nomo is one of only five players that have ever pitched at least one no-hitter game in both the [[National League]] and [[American League]] in [[Major League Baseball]] history.

in [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] (NPB) and [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). He achieved early success in his native country, where he played with the [[Kintetsu Buffaloes]] from {{Baseball year|1990}} to {{Baseball year|1994}}. He then exploited a loophole to free himself from his contract, and became the first Japanese major leaguer to permanently relocate to MLB in the United States, debuting with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in {{Baseball year|1995}}. Although not the first Japanese person to play baseball professionally in the US, Nomo is often credited with opening the door for [[List of Japanese players in Major League Baseball|Japanese players in MLB]], due to his star status.<ref>[http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080717&content_id=3145811&vkey=news_la&fext=.jsp&c_id=la Nomo retires from baseball | dodgers.com: News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNomo pitched over a span of 13 seasons in the American major leagues with 8 different teams, before retiring in {{Baseball year|2008}}. In 1995, he won the [[National League]] (NL) [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] and was named an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star]]. He twice led MLB in [[strikeout]]s and also threw two [[no-hitter]]s. He was the only Japanese pitcher in MLB to throw a no-hitter until the [[Seattle Mariners]]' [[Hisashi Iwakuma]] did so on August 12, 2015, against the [[Baltimore Orioles]].<ref>[https://www.sbnation.com/2015/8/12/9145279/hisashi-iwakuma-no-hitter-mariners-orioles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nNomo was well known for his distinctive \"tornado\" [[Pitching position|pitching windup and delivery]]. In 2014, Nomo was inducted into the [[Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame]]. He currently resides in [[Los Angeles, California]].\n\n==Early life==\nNomo was born in [[Minato-ku, Osaka]], Japan, into the working-class family of Shizuo, a [[fisherman]] and [[postal worker]], and Kayoko, a part-time [[supermarket]] employee. As a youth, Nomo was shy and withdrawn, although passionate about baseball. He developed his corkscrew-style pitching motion in order to impress his father while playing [[catch (game)|catch]]. He believed that rotating from having his back turned to his target would help him add speed to his pitches.<ref name=loophole>{{cite news |last1=Whiting |first1=Robert |title=Contract loophole opened door for Nomo's jump |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2010/10/10/baseball/japanese-baseball/contract-loophole-opened-door-for-nomos-jump/ |accessdate=2 November 2015 |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=October 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\nNomo graduated from Seijo Industrial High School in Osaka where he grew to {{convert|188|cm|ftin}} and {{convert|91|kg|lb}}. However, he was not selected in the [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] draft due to issues with his control. Instead, in 1988, Nomo joined Shin-Nittetsu Sakai, an Industrial League team representing [[Nippon Steel]]'s branch in [[Sakai, Osaka]]. During this time, Nomo slept with a [[tennis ball]] taped between his fingers in order to perfect his [[forkball]] grip.<ref name=loophole />\n\n==Success in Nippon Professional Baseball==\nNomo honed his forkball and his control while pitching in the Industrial League. At the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], Nomo played for the [[silver medal]]-winning [[Japan national baseball team|Japanese baseball team]] and the [[Kintetsu Buffaloes]] drafted him in {{Baseball year|1989}}. Nomo debuted with them in 1990 and was an immediate success, going 18\u20138 but more impressively striking out 287 hitters in just 235 [[inning]]s. The strikeout numbers were attributed to his unorthodox wind-up, where he turned his back to the hitter, raised his pivot leg, and paused for a second before throwing. The delivery increased his pitch speed and made it more difficult for batters to spot the ball coming out of his hand. The windup gave him the nickname \"Tornado.\"<ref name=loophole /> Nomo won the [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] that year.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Triple_Crown#Nippon_Professional_Baseball_2</ref>\n\nIn his first four seasons, Nomo was as consistent, and consistently good, as any pitcher in [[Professional baseball in Japan|Japanese baseball]], [[Win (baseball)|winning]] 17 or 18 games each year. His fifth season in 1994 was marred by a shoulder injury and netted him only eight wins. Nomo's forkball became famous for being unpredictable for hitters and catchers alike.\n\n==Moving to the United States==\nNomo had become one of the most popular baseball players in Japan but after the 1994 season, Nomo got into a contract dispute with team management. The Buffaloes rebuffed Nomo's demands to have a contract agent and multi-year contract. Because he was drafted by Kintetsu, the Buffaloes retained exclusive rights to Nomo; however, Nomo's agent, [[Don Nomura]], found a [[loophole]] in the Japanese Uniform Players Contract to enable him to become a [[free agent]]. The \"voluntary retirement clause\" allowed a player who retired to play for whomever he wished after returning to active status.<ref name=loophole /> This led to him heading to the U.S., where in February 1995, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed him.\n\nNomo made his U.S. pro baseball debut with the [[Bakersfield Blaze]] on April 27, 1995, against the [[Rancho Cucamonga Quakes]]. Placed on a 90-pitch limit, and throwing mainly [[fastball]]s, Nomo pitched 5\u2153 innings, taking the 2\u20131 [[Loss (baseball)|loss]] against the Quakes. On May 2, after a month in the [[Minor league baseball|minors]] necessitated by [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|a player's strike]], he became the first [[List of Japanese players in Major League Baseball|Japanese-born Major Leaguer]] to appear in a major league game since [[Masanori Murakami]] in {{Baseball year|1965}}. He was also the first Japanese-born player to relocate permanently to the American major leagues, as Murakami played only two seasons with the [[San Francisco Giants]] and then returned to the Japanese major leagues for the remainder of his career. The pressure on Nomo would be tremendous, and Japanese media and fans appeared in large numbers in games he started. Nomo's games were regularly broadcast live to Japan, despite the fact most people would be waking up when he started games.\n\n==Career in Major League Baseball==\n\n===1995\u20131997===\nThe tornado delivery that baffled batters in Japan had the same effect on major league hitters, and he led the league in strikeouts in 1995 (while finishing second in [[Base on balls|walks]]) and was second with a 2.54 [[Earned run average|ERA]]. He struck out 11.101 batters per 9 innings to break [[Sandy Koufax]]'s single-season franchise record of 10.546 in {{Baseball year|1962}}.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/LAD/leaders_pitch.shtml</ref> He also started that year's [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], striking out three of the six batters he faced. He topped out at 93&nbsp;mph in that game. But he only barely won NL Rookie of the Year honors that year over future [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|MVP]] [[Chipper Jones]], as many voters felt that his Japanese success made him anything but a rookie, although he qualified by Major League rules. Nomo had another fine season in {{Baseball year|1996}} which was capped by a no-hitter thrown on September 17 in the unlikeliest of places, [[Denver, Colorado|Denver's]] [[Coors Field]], a park notoriously known as being a hitters' park because of its high elevation, semi-arid climate, and lack of [[Foul ball|foul territory]]. Nomo's no-hitter remains as the only one in Coors Field, and was the last Dodger to throw a no-hitter until [[Josh Beckett]] completed one on May 25, 2014.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moore |first1=Jack |title=Throwback Thursday: Hideo Nomo Defies The Odds For A Coors Field No-No |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vva57d/throwback-thursday-hideo-nomo-defies-the-odds-for-a-coors-field-no-no |website=Vice |accessdate=15 August 2019 |date=17 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/gallery/featured/GAL1137746/13/26/index.htm |work=CNN |title=Most Popular |accessdate=May 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202041010/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/gallery/featured/GAL1137746/13/26/index.htm |archivedate=December 2, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nNomo also found commercial success in America. Nomo had a signature sneaker, called the [[Air Max]] Nomo, produced by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] in 1996. Also, he appeared on a [[Segata Sanshiro]] commercial for the [[Sega Saturn]] in 1997.\n\nAs batters caught on to his delivery, his effectiveness waned a bit in {{Baseball year|1997}}, although he still went 14\u201312, joining [[Dwight Gooden]] as the only other pitcher to strike out at least 200 batters in each of his first three seasons.\n\n===1998\u20132000===\nNomo pitched poorly in {{Baseball year|1998}}, starting the season 2\u20137 and was dealt to the [[New York Mets]]. His performance did not improve and was released that season. In {{Baseball year|1999}}, he signed with the [[Chicago Cubs]] and made three starts for their Triple-A minor league team before refusing to make further starts in the minors, and received a contract with the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], where he went 12\u20138 with a 4.54 ERA. He reached the 1,000 strikeout mark in 1999, the third fastest in major league history. The Brewers waived him after contract issues and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] claimed him, then granted him [[free agent|free agency]] only 24 hours later after more contract issues. Finally signed by the [[Detroit Tigers]] in {{Baseball year|2000}}, he went 8\u201312 with a 4.74 ERA and was again released.\n\n===2001\u20132003===\nNomo signed with the [[Boston Red Sox]] in {{Baseball year|2001}} and started the season in spectacular fashion, throwing his second no-hitter in his Sox debut, on April 4, against the [[Baltimore Orioles]], walking three and striking out 11. This no-hitter was the first in the 10-year history of [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] and made Nomo the first Red Sox to pitch a no-hitter since [[Dave Morehead]] in {{Baseball year|1965}}. Nomo also became just the fourth player in baseball history to have thrown a no-hitter in both leagues (joining [[Cy Young]], [[Jim Bunning]] and [[Nolan Ryan]]. [[Randy Johnson]] would later join them, becoming the fifth player after throwing a [[Randy Johnson's perfect game|perfect game]] in 2004). It is the earliest, calendar-wise, that a Major League Baseball no-hitter has been pitched. Nomo also led the league in strikeouts for the first time since his first season in MLB.\n\nA free agent after the end of the year, Nomo returned to the Dodgers, in {{Baseball year|2002}}. He ended up having his best season since 1996, posting a 16\u20136 record, 193 strikeouts, and 3.39 ERA. The following year, he had another great season, going 16\u201313 with 177 K and a 3.09 ERA. During September {{Baseball year|2003}}, however, he began to exhibit signs of injury and fatigue.\n\n===2004\u20132008===\n[[File:HideoNomo.png|thumb|Nomo pitching for Tampa Bay in 2005]]\nNomo began to struggle again in {{Baseball year|2004}}. After undergoing shoulder surgery in October 2003, he was benched after going 4\u201311 with an 8.25 ERA for the Dodgers (the worst ERA in the history of baseball for a player with at least 15 decisions in a season).\n\nBefore the start of [[spring training]] for {{Baseball year|2005}}, he signed a $800,000 contract with the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]]. The contract also included a $700,000 incentive that kicked in if Nomo started 20 games. The stipulation was allegedly included because Devil Rays upper management was unsure if Nomo had fully recovered from his injury. After a poor start in which he posted a 7.24 ERA, he was released on July 25. Coincidentally or not, this was two days before he was slated to make his twentieth major league start. On July 27, Nomo was picked up off waivers by the [[New York Yankees]], who signed him to a minor league contract, but never recalled him. Nomo was signed to a minor league contract by the [[Chicago White Sox]] during spring training in {{Baseball year|2006}} to play for the Triple-A [[Charlotte Knights]] of the [[International League]], but the White Sox released him on June 7 of that year.\n\nIn {{Baseball year|2007}}, Nomo signed on with the [[Leones del Caracas]] of the [[Venezuelan Winter League]], managed by his former catcher, [[Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez (catcher)|Carlos Hern\u00e1ndez]]. His participation in the Venezuelan league was viewed as a first step toward an eventual Major League comeback. He made his debut on October 20, 2007, against Tiburones de La Guaira. Nomo pitched one inning, allowing one [[Hit (baseball)|hit]] and no [[Run (baseball)|runs]].\n\nOn January 4, {{Baseball year|2008}}, Nomo signed a [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] contract for 2008 with the [[Kansas City Royals]]. If added to the roster Nomo would have received a $600,000 one-year contract and the chance to earn $100,000 in performance bonuses.<ref>http://www.kansascity.com/sports/royals/story/430041.html</ref> On April 5, his contract was bought by the Royals and was added to the 25-man roster. On April 10, Nomo made his first major league appearance since 2005. He faced the New York Yankees in relief. He was brought in to start the seventh inning of a game while the Yankees were leading 4-1. Nomo loaded the bases, but was able to retire his native countryman, [[Hideki Matsui]], to strand all three runners. However, he later surrendered back-to-back homers to [[Alex Rodriguez]] and [[Jorge Posada]] in the ninth inning. On April 20, Nomo was designated for assignment.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080420&content_id=2558546&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb Nomo designated for assignment]</ref> The Royals released him on April 29, 2008. On July 17, 2008, Nomo officially announced his retirement from Major League Baseball.\n\n==Post playing career==\nPrior to the 2016 season, the [[San Diego Padres]] hired Nomo as Advisor for Baseball Operations, to assist the club with player development and expand their international profile.<ref>{{cite web |first=Corey |last=Brock |title=Padres hire Nomo as baseball ops advisor |url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/164272574/hideo-nomo-joins-padres-as-an-advisor/ |website=MLB.com |date=February 11, 2016 |accessdate=November 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Corey |last=Brock |title=Nomo eager to broaden Padres' Pacific Rim presence |url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/165848594/hideo-nomo-makes-his-mark-in-padres-camp/ |website=MLB.com |date=March 1, 2016 |accessdate=November 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Playing style==\nWith an overhand delivery, Nomo threw a fastball topping out at 95&nbsp;mph and a [[forkball]] as his primary pitches.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/02/sports/baseball-dodgers-cut-nomo-loose-and-will-try-to-trade-him.html BASEBALL; Dodgers Cut Nomo Loose And Will Try to Trade Him] The New York Times</ref>\n\n== Accomplishments ==\nNomo earned 123 wins in the Major Leagues and 78 in Japan, winning his 200th overall game on June 15, 2005. Nomo's success helped inspire other stars from Japan such as [[Ichiro Suzuki]], [[Hideki Matsui]], and [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]] to come over to the States as well.\n\nIn addition, Nomo is one of only five players that have ever pitched at least one no-hitter game in both the [[National League]] and [[American League]] in [[Major League Baseball]] history. He has, to date, thrown the only no-hitters at [[Coors Field]] and [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]].\n\nHe won the 1996 [[ESPY Award]] for Breakthrough Athlete.\n\nNomo was elected to the [[Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 2014, only the third ever to be selected in their first year of eligibility.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.truebluela.com/2014/1/17/5319072/hideo-nomo-hall-of-fame-japan |title=Hideo Nomo elected to Japan Baseball Hall of Fame |first=Eric |last=Stephen |work=truebluela.com |date=January 17, 2014 |accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref>  At the time, he was also the youngest player ever elected to that Hall of Fame, although his record was broken in 2018 by [[Hideki Matsui]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2018/1/16/16897486/hideki-matsui-japanese-baseball-hall-of-fame |title=Hideki Matsui was elected to the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame |last1=McIntosh |first1=Whitney |date=January 16, 2018 |website=SB Nation |access-date=January 17, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nA song about Nomo, \"There's No One Like Nomo\" performed by [[Jack Sheldon]], written by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] and [[Alan and Marilyn Bergman]], was released by [[GNP Crescendo Records]] (GNPD 1406) in 1996.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-10-05-ca-53472-story.html |title=RADIOSharpes Off the Air: Jim and Melissa... |last=Snow |first=Shauna |work=ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT REPORTS FROM THE TIMES, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL NEWS SERVICES AND THE NATION'S PRESS |date=5 October 1995 |publisher=The [[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=9 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nNomo has been referenced in [[hip-hop]] lyrics by [[rappers]] such as [[Pusha T]] and [[Wale Folarin|Wale]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Athlete References in Rap Music |url=https://genius.com/2782495 |website=Rap Genius |publisher=[[Genius (website)|Genius]] |accessdate=2 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nPro wrestler [[Mitsuhide Hirasawa]] adopted the ring name Hideo Saito, partially in homage to Nomo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://411mania.com/wrestling/njpw-road-to-power-struggle-results-10-23-16-chigane-japan-kenny-omega-teamed-with-the-young-bucks/ |title=NJPW Road to Power Struggle Results 10.23.16 \u2013 Chigane, Japan: Kenny Omega Teamed With The Young Bucks |last=Harris |first=Jeffrey |work=WrestlingInc.com |date=23 October 2016 |publisher=411 Mania |accessdate=9 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual strikeout leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career strikeout leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball no-hitters]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual shutout leaders]]\n* [[Eiji Sawamura Award]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Fagen, Herb.
