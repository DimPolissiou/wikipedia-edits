It was on the afternoon of April 6th that we again came up with them in a strong position on the thickly wooded banks of Sailor\u2019s Creek. They were behind rude fortifications and the thick growth of underbrush kept their numbers concealed from us. We didn\u2019t know how many rebels there were in those ditches until we charged.... I was one of the men lowered to terra firma swiftly, my fine black charger being killed under me. We were repulsed, and as we fell back over logs and interleaving vines, the rebel volleys continued thinning out the ranks. Men and beasts were floundering together in the dense thicket.\n\n\u201cI groped about with my eyes blinded with the smoke and fortunately bumped squarely into a phlegmatic mule with a Confederate saddle on....\n\n\u201cI mounted him and hurried back through the woods to the clearing, where our forces were rallying....\n\n\u201cJust as I reached the rallying troops the bugle sounded \u2018Charge\u2019 again and back we went at those breastworks over stumps and through drooping branches. It took my mule just about four jumps to show that in an obstacle race he could outclass all others. He laid back his ears and frisked over logs and flattened out like a jackrabbit, when he had a chance to sprint. Soon I was ahead, far ahead of the rest of the boys. That mule never even stopped when he came to the breastworks. He switched his tail and sailed right over among the rebs, landing near a rebel color-bearer of the Twelfth Virginia Infantry.\n\n\u201cAbout all that I can remember of what followed was that the mule and I went after him. The color-bearer was a big brawny chap and he put up a game fight. But that mule had some new sidesteps and posterior upper-cuts that put the reb out of the game.\n\n\u201cA sabre slash across the right arm made him drop his colors and I grabbed them before they touched the ground.\u201d</blockquote>\n\nThe book's editors added that Cunningham was wounded twice before capturing the enemy's flag, and noted that [[George Custer|Brevet Major-General George Custer]] was so impressed by what he saw as he watched Cunningham in action that \"he at once placed him on his staff, and later recommended him for the Medal of Honor.\"<ref>Beyer and Keydel, ''Deeds of Valor from Records in the Archives of the United States Government: How American Heroes Won the Medal of Honor'', p. 529.</ref>\n\nAs a member of Custer's staff,<ref>Urwin, Gregory J.

During the [[Weimar Republic]] period, the KPD usually polled between 10 and 15 percent of the vote and was represented in the {{lang|de|[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]}} and in state parliaments. Under the leadership of [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]] from 1925\u00a0the party became staunchly [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and loyal to the leadership of the [[Soviet Union]], and from 1928 it was largely controlled and funded by the [[Comintern]] in Moscow. Under Th\u00e4lmann's leadership the party directed most of its attacks against the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], which it regarded as its main adversary and referred to as \"[[social fascism|social fascists]]\"; the KPD considered all other parties in the Weimar Republic to be \"[[fascist (insult)|fascists]]\".<ref name=\"Hoppe\">{{cite book |last=Hoppe |first=Bert |year=2011 |title=In Stalins Gefolgschaft: Moskau und die KPD 1928\u20131933 |url= |location= |publisher= Oldenbourg Verlag |page= |isbn= 9783486711738 |author-link=}}</ref>\n\nThe party's paramilitary wing was the [[Roter Frontk\u00e4mpferbund]] (\"Alliance of Red Front-Fighters\"), which was banned as extremist by the governing social democrats in 1929; in 1932 the KPD also founded [[Antifaschistische Aktion]], commonly known as Antifa, which it described as a \"red united [[Communist front|front]] under the leadership of the only anti-fascist party, the KPD\", and which largely attacked the \"social fascists\" [social democrats].<ref>{{cite book |last= Stephan|first= Pieroth|year= 1994 |title=Parteien und Presse in Rheinland-Pfalz 1945\u20131971: ein Beitrag zur Mediengeschichte unter besonderer Ber\u00fccksichtigung der Mainzer SPD-Zeitung 'Die Freiheit' |url= |location= |publisher= v.

The KPD was banned as extremist in West Germany in 1956 by the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Constitutional Court]]. Some of its former members founded an even smaller fringe party, the [[German Communist Party]] (DKP), in 1969, which remains legal, and multiple tiny splinter groups claiming to be the successor to the KPD have also subsequently been formed.\n\nIn [[East Germany]], the party was merged, by Soviet decree, with remnants of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] to form the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) which ruled East Germany from 1949 until 1989\u20131990; the forced merger was opposed by the social democrats, many of whom fled to the western zones. After the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], reformists took over the SED and renamed it the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (PDS); in 2007 the PDS subsequently merged with the SPD splinter faction [[Labour and Social Justice \u2013 The Electoral Alternative|WASG]] to form {{lang|de|[[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]]}}.\n\n==Early history==\nBefore the [[First World War]] the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) was the largest party in Germany and the world's most successful socialist party. Although still officially claiming to be a Marxist party, by 1914 it had become in practice a reformist party. In 1914 the SPD members of the Reichstag voted in favour of the war. Left-wing members of the party, led by [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], strongly opposed the war, and the SPD soon suffered a split, with the leftists forming the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party]] of [[Germany]] (USPD) and the more radical [[Spartacist League]]. In November 1918, [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|revolution]] broke out across Germany. The leftists, led by Rosa Luxemburg and the Spartacist League, formed the KPD at a founding congress held in Berlin in 30 December 1918 \u2013 1 January 1919 in the reception hall of the City Council.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rosa Luxemburg|last=Nettl, J.

Germany's Social Democratic government, which had come to power after the fall of the Monarchy, was vehemently opposed to the KPD's idea of socialism. With the new regime terrified of a [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in Germany, Defense Minister [[Gustav Noske]] formed a series of [[anti-communist]] [[Weimar paramilitary groups|paramilitary groups]], dubbed \"[[Freikorps]]\", out of demobilized World War I veterans. During the failed [[Spartacist uprising]] in [[Berlin]] of January 1919, Liebknecht and Luxemburg, who had not initiated the uprising but joined once it had begun, were captured by the Freikorps and murdered. The Party split a few months later into two factions, the KPD and the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD).\n\nFollowing the assassination of [[Leo Jogiches]], [[Paul Levi]] became the KPD leader. Other prominent members included [[Clara Zetkin]], [[Paul Fr\u00f6lich]], [[Hugo Eberlein]], [[Franz Mehring]], [[August Thalheimer]], and [[Ernst Meyer (German politician)|Ernst Meyer]]. Levi led the party away from the policy of immediate revolution, in an effort to win over SPD and USPD voters and [[trade union]] officials. These efforts were rewarded when a substantial section of the USPD joined the KPD, making it a mass party for the first time.\n\nThrough the 1920s the KPD was racked by internal conflict between more and less radical factions, partly reflecting the power struggles between [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] in Moscow. Germany was seen as being of central importance to the struggle for socialism, and the failure of the German revolution was a major setback. Eventually Levi was expelled in 1921 by the [[Comintern]] for \"indiscipline.\" Further leadership changes took place in the 1920s. Supporters of the Left or Right Opposition to the Stalin-controlled Comintern leadership were expelled; of these, [[Heinrich Brandler]], August Thalheimer and [[Paul Fr\u00f6lich]] set up a splinter [[Communist Party Opposition]].\n\n==Weimar Republic years==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P046279, Berlin, Liebknecht-Haus am B\u00fclowplatz.jpg|thumb|[[Karl-Liebknecht-Haus]], the KPD's headquarters from 1926 to 1933.

This leadership, headed by [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]], abandoned the goal of immediate revolution, and from 1924 onwards contested Reichstag elections, with some success.\n\nDuring the years of the [[Weimar Republic]], the KPD was the largest communist party in Europe and was seen as the \"leading party\" of the communist movement outside the Soviet Union.<ref>Ralf Hoffrogge / Norman LaPorte (eds.): ''Weimar Communism as Mass Movement 1918\u20131933'', London: Lawrence & Wishart, p. 2</ref> It maintained a solid electoral performance, usually polling more than 10% of the vote and gaining 100 deputies in the [[November 1932 German federal election|November 1932 elections]]. In the [[1932 German presidential election|presidential election of the same year]], Th\u00e4lmann took 13.2% of the vote, compared to Hitler's 30.1%. Under Th\u00e4lmann's leadership, the party was closely aligned with the Soviet leadership headed by [[Joseph Stalin]], and from 1928 the party was largely controlled and funded by [[Comintern]] in Moscow.<ref name=\"Hoppe\">{{cite book |last=Hoppe |first=Bert |year=2011 |title=In Stalins Gefolgschaft: Moskau und die KPD 1928\u20131933 |url= |location= |publisher= Oldenbourg Verlag |page= |isbn= 9783486711738 |author-link=}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the Weimar era, the KPD viewed the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) as its main adversary,<ref name=\"Hoppe\" /> and the KPD referred to the SPD as \"[[social fascism|social fascists]]\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Winner |first=David |date= |title=How the left enabled fascism: Ernst Th\u00e4lmann, leader of Germany's radical left in the last years of the Weimar Republic, thought the centre left was a greater danger than the right|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2018/10/how-left-enabled-fascism |work=[[New Statesman]] |location= |access-date= }}</ref> The KPD regarded itself as \"the only anti-fascist party\" in Germany and held that all other parties in the Weimar Republic were \"fascist\".<ref name=\"Hoppe\" /><!-- p. 195 --> Nevertheless it cooperated with the Nazis in the early 1930s in attacking the social democrats, and both sought to destroy the liberal democracy of the [[Weimar Republic]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fippel |first1=G\u00fcnter|year= 2003 |title=Antifaschisten in \"antifaschistischer\" Gewalt: mittel- und ostdeutsche Schicksale in den Auseinandersetzungen zwischen Demokratie und Diktatur (1945 bis 1961)|url= |location= |publisher= A.

The detailed planning for the murders had been carried out by KPD members of the Reichstag, [[Heinz Neumann]] and [[Hans Kippenberger]], based on orders issued by [[Walter Ulbricht]], the Party's leader in the Berlin-Brandenberg region. Shooter [[Erich Mielke]] who later became the head of the [[Stasi|East German Secret Police]], would only face trial for the murders in 1993.\n\nWhile also opposed to the Nazis, the KPD regarded the Nazi Party as a less sophisticated and thus less dangerous fascist party than the SPD, and KPD leader Ernst Th\u00e4lmann declared that \"some Nazi trees must not be allowed to overshadow a forest\" of social democrats.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coppi |first1=Hans |author-link1=Hans Coppi Jr. |year=1998 |title=Die nationalsozialistischen B\u00e4ume im sozialdemokratischen Wald: Die KPD im antifaschistischen Zweifrontenkrieg (Teil 2) |trans-title=The national socialist trees in the social democratic forest: The KPD in the anti-fascist two-front war (Part 2) |url= |journal=Utopie Kreativ |volume=97\u201398|issue= |pages=7\u201317 |doi= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nCritics of the KPD accused it of having pursued a sectarian policy, e.g. the Social Democratic Party criticized the KPD's thesis of \"[[social fascism]]\" (which addressed the SPD as the Communist's main enemy). This scuttled any possibility of a united front with the SPD against the rising power of the [[Nazism|National Socialists]]. These allegations were repudiated by supporters of the KPD as it was said{{by whom|date=June 2015}} the right-wing leadership of the SPD rejected the proposals of the KPD to unite for the defeat of fascism. The SPD leaders were accused of having countered KPD efforts to form a united front of the working class. For instance, after [[Franz von Papen]]'s government [[Preu\u00dfenschlag|carried out a coup d'\u00e9tat]] in [[Prussia]] the KPD called for a general strike and turned to the SPD leadership for joint struggle, but the SPD leaders again refused to cooperate with the KPD.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Nazi era==\nOn 27 February, soon after the appointment of [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor, the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag was set on fire]] and Dutch [[council communism|council communist]] [[Marinus van der Lubbe]] was found near the building. The Nazis publicly blamed the fire on communist agitators in general, although in a German court in 1933, it was decided that van der Lubbe had acted alone, as he claimed to have done. The following day, Hitler persuaded Hindenburg to issue the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]]. It suspended the civil liberties enshrined in the constitution, ostensibly to deal with Communist acts of violence.\n\nRepression began within hours of the fire, when police arrested dozens of Communists. Although Hitler could have formally banned the KPD, he did not do so right away. Not only was he reluctant to chance a violent uprising, but he believed the KPD could siphon off SPD votes and split the left. However, most judges held the KPD responsible for the fire, and took the line that KPD membership was in and of itself a treasonous act. At the [[March 1933 German federal election|March 1933 election]], the KPD elected 81 deputies. However, it was an open secret that they would never be allowed to take up their seats; they were all arrested in short order. For all intents and purposes, the KPD was \"outlawed\" on the day the Reichstag Fire Decree was issued, and \"completely banned\" as of 6 March, the day after the election.<ref name=Evans>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|authorlink=Richard J.

Since the bill was effectively a constitutional amendment, a [[quorum]] of two-thirds of the entire Reichstag had to be present in order to formally call up the bill. Leaving nothing to chance, Reichstag President [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] did not count the KPD seats for purposes of obtaining the required quorum. This led historian [[Richard J. Evans]] to contend that the Enabling Act had been passed in a manner contrary to law. The Nazis did not need to count the KPD deputies for purposes of getting a supermajority of two-thirds of those deputies present and voting. However, Evans argued, not counting the KPD deputies for purposes of a quorum amounted to \"refusing to recognize their existence\", and was thus \"an illegal act\".<ref name=Evans/>\n\nThe KPD was efficiently suppressed by the Nazis. The most senior KPD leaders were [[Wilhelm Pieck]] and [[Walter Ulbricht]], who went into exile in the Soviet Union. The KPD maintained an underground organisation in Germany throughout the Nazi period, but the loss of many core members severely weakened the Party's infrastructure.\n\n==Purge of 1937==\nA number of senior KPD leaders in exile were caught up in [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] of 1937\u201338 and executed, among them [[Hugo Eberlein]], [[Heinz Neumann]], [[Hermann Remmele]], [[Fritz Schulte]] and [[Hermann Schubert (German communist)|Hermann Schubert]], or sent to the [[gulag]], like [[Margarete Buber-Neumann]]. Still others, like [[Gustav von Wangenheim]] and [[Erich Mielke]] (later the head of the Stasi in East Germany), denounced their fellow exiles to the [[NKVD]].<ref>Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror'', 576-77.</ref> [[Willi M\u00fcnzenberg]], the KPD's propaganda chief, was murdered in mysterious circumstances in France in 1940. The NKVD is believed to have been responsible.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Postwar history==\nIn East Germany, the Soviet [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|occupation authorities]] forced the eastern branch of the SPD to [[Merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany|merge]] with the KPD (led by Pieck and Ulbricht) to form the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) in April 1946.<ref>Eric D. Weitz, ''Creating German Communism, 1890\u20131990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997</ref> Although nominally a union of equals, the SED quickly fell under Communist domination, and most of the more recalcitrant members from the SPD side of the merger were pushed out in short order. By the time of the formal formation of the East German state in 1949, the SED was a full-fledged Communist party, and developed along lines similar to other Soviet-bloc Communist parties.<ref>David Priestand, ''Red Flag: A History of Communism'',\" New York: Grove Press, 2009</ref> It was the ruling party in East Germany from its formation in 1949 until 1989. The SPD managed to preserve its independence in Berlin, forcing the SED to form a small branch in West Berlin, the [[Socialist Unity Party of West Berlin]].\n\nThe KPD reorganised in the western part of Germany, and received 5.7% of the vote in the [[1949 German federal election|first Bundestag election]] in 1949. But the onset of the [[Cold War]] and imposition of an undisguised Communist dictatorship in East Germany soon caused a collapse in the party's support. At the [[1953 German federal election|1953 election]] the KPD only won 2.2 percent of the total votes and lost all of its seats, never to return. The party was banned in August 1956 by the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]].<ref>Eric D. Weitz, ''Creating German Communism, 1890\u20131990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997</ref> The decision was upheld by the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] in ''[[Communist Party of Germany v. the Federal Republic of Germany]]''.  The ban was due to the aggressive and combative methods that the party used as a \"Marxist-Leninist party struggle\" to achieve their goals. \n\nAfter the party was declared illegal, many of its members continued to function clandestinely despite increased government surveillance. Part of its membership refounded the party in 1968 as the [[German Communist Party]] (DKP). Following [[German reunification]] many DKP members joined the new [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]], formed out of the remains of the SED. In 1968, a self-named \"true successor\" to the (banned) West German KPD was formed, the [[Communist Party of Germany/Marxists-Leninists|KPD/ML]] (Marxist\u2013Leninist), which followed [[Maoism|Maoist]] ideas. It went through multiple splits and united with a Trotskyist group in 1986 to form the [[Unified Socialist Party (Germany)|Unified Socialist Party]] (VSP), which failed to gain any influence and dissolved in the early 1990s.<ref>Eric D. Weitz, ''Creating German Communism, 1890\u20131990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997</ref> However, multiple tiny splinter groups originating in the KPD/ML still exist, several of which claim the name of KPD. [[Communist Party of Germany (1990)|Another]] party with this name was formed in 1990 in East Berlin by several hardline Communists who had been expelled from the PDS, including [[Erich Honecker]]. The \"KPD (Bolshevik)\" split off from the East German KPD in 2005, bringing the total number of (more or less) active KPDs to at least 5. \n\n[[The Left (Germany)|The Left]], formed out of a merger between the PDS and [[Labour and Social Justice \u2013 The Electoral Alternative]] in 2007, claims to be the historical successor of the KPD (by way of the PDS).\n\n==Organization==\n\nIn the early 1920s, the party operated under the principle of [[democratic centralism]], whereby the leading body of the party was the [[Congress]], meeting at least once a year.<ref>Broue, P. (2006) ''The German Revolution: 1917\u20131923'', Chicago: Haymarket Books, pg.635</ref> Between Congresses, leadership of the party resided in the [[Central Committee]], which was elected at the Congress, of one group of people who had to live where the leadership was resident and formed the Zentrale and others nominated from the districts they represented (but also elected at the Congress) who represented the wider party.<ref>Broue, P.

During the [[Weimar Republic]] period, the KPD usually polled between 10 and 15 percent of the vote and was represented in the {{lang|de|[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]}} and in state parliaments. Under the leadership of [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]] from 1925\u00a0the party became staunchly [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] and loyal to the leadership of the [[Soviet Union]], and from 1928 it was largely controlled and funded by the [[Comintern]] in Moscow. Under Th\u00e4lmann's leadership the party directed most of its attacks against the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], which it regarded as its main adversary and referred to as \"[[social fascism|social fascists]]\"; the KPD considered all other parties in the Weimar Republic to be \"[[fascist (insult)|fascists]]\".<ref name=\"Hoppe\">{{cite book |last=Hoppe |first=Bert |year=2011 |title=In Stalins Gefolgschaft: Moskau und die KPD 1928\u20131933 |url= |location= |publisher= Oldenbourg Verlag |page= |isbn= 9783486711738 |author-link=}}</ref>\n\nThe party's paramilitary wing was the [[Roter Frontk\u00e4mpferbund]] (\"Alliance of Red Front-Fighters\"), which was banned as extremist by the governing social democrats in 1929; in 1932 the KPD also founded [[Antifaschistische Aktion]], commonly known as Antifa, which it described as a \"red united [[Communist front|front]] under the leadership of the only anti-fascist party, the KPD\", and which largely attacked the \"social fascists\" [social democrats].<ref>{{cite book |last= Stephan|first= Pieroth|year= 1994 |title=Parteien und Presse in Rheinland-Pfalz 1945\u20131971: ein Beitrag zur Mediengeschichte unter besonderer Ber\u00fccksichtigung der Mainzer SPD-Zeitung 'Die Freiheit' |url= |location= |publisher= v.

The KPD was banned as extremist in West Germany in 1956 by the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Constitutional Court]]. Some of its former members founded an even smaller fringe party, the [[German Communist Party]] (DKP), in 1969, which remains legal, and multiple tiny splinter groups claiming to be the successor to the KPD have also subsequently been formed.\n\nIn [[East Germany]], the party was merged, by Soviet decree, with remnants of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] to form the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) which ruled East Germany from 1949 until 1989\u20131990; the forced merger was opposed by the social democrats, many of whom fled to the western zones. After the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], reformists took over the SED and renamed it the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (PDS); in 2007 the PDS subsequently merged with the SPD splinter faction [[Labour and Social Justice \u2013 The Electoral Alternative|WASG]] to form {{lang|de|[[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]]}}.\n\n==Early history==\nBefore the [[First World War]] the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) was the largest party in Germany and the world's most successful socialist party. Although still officially claiming to be a Marxist party, by 1914 it had become in practice a reformist party. In 1914 the SPD members of the Reichstag voted in favour of the war. Left-wing members of the party, led by [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], strongly opposed the war, and the SPD soon suffered a split, with the leftists forming the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|Independent Social Democratic Party]] of [[Germany]] (USPD) and the more radical [[Spartacist League]]. In November 1918, [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|revolution]] broke out across Germany. The leftists, led by Rosa Luxemburg and the Spartacist League, formed the KPD at a founding congress held in Berlin in 30 December 1918 \u2013 1 January 1919 in the reception hall of the City Council.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rosa Luxemburg|last=Nettl, J.

Germany's Social Democratic government, which had come to power after the fall of the Monarchy, was vehemently opposed to the KPD's idea of socialism. With the new regime terrified of a [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in Germany, Defense Minister [[Gustav Noske]] formed a series of [[anti-communist]] [[Weimar paramilitary groups|paramilitary groups]], dubbed \"[[Freikorps]]\", out of demobilized World War I veterans. During the failed [[Spartacist uprising]] in [[Berlin]] of January 1919, Liebknecht and Luxemburg, who had not initiated the uprising but joined once it had begun, were captured by the Freikorps and murdered. The Party split a few months later into two factions, the KPD and the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD).\n\nFollowing the assassination of [[Leo Jogiches]], [[Paul Levi]] became the KPD leader. Other prominent members included [[Clara Zetkin]], [[Paul Fr\u00f6lich]], [[Hugo Eberlein]], [[Franz Mehring]], [[August Thalheimer]], and [[Ernst Meyer (German politician)|Ernst Meyer]]. Levi led the party away from the policy of immediate revolution, in an effort to win over SPD and USPD voters and [[trade union]] officials. These efforts were rewarded when a substantial section of the USPD joined the KPD, making it a mass party for the first time.\n\nThrough the 1920s the KPD was racked by internal conflict between more and less radical factions, partly reflecting the power struggles between [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] in Moscow. Germany was seen as being of central importance to the struggle for socialism, and the failure of the German revolution was a major setback. Eventually Levi was expelled in 1921 by the [[Comintern]] for \"indiscipline.\" Further leadership changes took place in the 1920s. Supporters of the Left or Right Opposition to the Stalin-controlled Comintern leadership were expelled; of these, [[Heinrich Brandler]], August Thalheimer and [[Paul Fr\u00f6lich]] set up a splinter [[Communist Party Opposition]].\n\n==Weimar Republic years==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P046279, Berlin, Liebknecht-Haus am B\u00fclowplatz.jpg|thumb|[[Karl-Liebknecht-Haus]], the KPD's headquarters from 1926 to 1933.

This leadership, headed by [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]], abandoned the goal of immediate revolution, and from 1924 onwards contested Reichstag elections, with some success.\n\nDuring the years of the [[Weimar Republic]], the KPD was the largest communist party in Europe and was seen as the \"leading party\" of the communist movement outside the Soviet Union.<ref>Ralf Hoffrogge / Norman LaPorte (eds.): ''Weimar Communism as Mass Movement 1918\u20131933'', London: Lawrence & Wishart, p. 2</ref> It maintained a solid electoral performance, usually polling more than 10% of the vote and gaining 100 deputies in the [[November 1932 German federal election|November 1932 elections]].

The detailed planning for the murders had been carried out by KPD members of the Reichstag, [[Heinz Neumann]] and [[Hans Kippenberger]], based on orders issued by [[Walter Ulbricht]], the Party's leader in the Berlin-Brandenberg region. Shooter [[Erich Mielke]] who later became the head of the [[Stasi|East German Secret Police]], would only face trial for the murders in 1993.\n\nWhile also opposed to the Nazis, the KPD regarded the Nazi Party as a less sophisticated and thus less dangerous fascist party than the SPD, and KPD leader Ernst Th\u00e4lmann declared that \"some Nazi trees must not be allowed to overshadow a forest\" of social democrats.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Coppi |first1=Hans |author-link1=Hans Coppi Jr. |year=1998 |title=Die nationalsozialistischen B\u00e4ume im sozialdemokratischen Wald: Die KPD im antifaschistischen Zweifrontenkrieg (Teil 2) |trans-title=The national socialist trees in the social democratic forest: The KPD in the anti-fascist two-front war (Part 2) |url= |journal=Utopie Kreativ |volume=97\u201398|issue= |pages=7\u201317 |doi= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nCritics of the KPD accused it of having pursued a sectarian policy, e.g. the Social Democratic Party criticized the KPD's thesis of \"[[social fascism]]\" (which addressed the SPD as the Communist's main enemy). This scuttled any possibility of a united front with the SPD against the rising power of the [[Nazism|National Socialists]]. These allegations were repudiated by supporters of the KPD as it was said{{by whom|date=June 2015}} the right-wing leadership of the SPD rejected the proposals of the KPD to unite for the defeat of fascism. The SPD leaders were accused of having countered KPD efforts to form a united front of the working class. For instance, after [[Franz von Papen]]'s government [[Preu\u00dfenschlag|carried out a coup d'\u00e9tat]] in [[Prussia]] the KPD called for a general strike and turned to the SPD leadership for joint struggle, but the SPD leaders again refused to cooperate with the KPD.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Nazi era==\nOn 27 February, soon after the appointment of [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor, the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag was set on fire]] and Dutch [[council communism|council communist]] [[Marinus van der Lubbe]] was found near the building. The Nazis publicly blamed the fire on communist agitators in general, although in a German court in 1933, it was decided that van der Lubbe had acted alone, as he claimed to have done. The following day, Hitler persuaded Hindenburg to issue the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]]. It suspended the civil liberties enshrined in the constitution, ostensibly to deal with Communist acts of violence.\n\nRepression began within hours of the fire, when police arrested dozens of Communists. Although Hitler could have formally banned the KPD, he did not do so right away. Not only was he reluctant to chance a violent uprising, but he believed the KPD could siphon off SPD votes and split the left. However, most judges held the KPD responsible for the fire, and took the line that KPD membership was in and of itself a treasonous act. At the [[March 1933 German federal election|March 1933 election]], the KPD elected 81 deputies. However, it was an open secret that they would never be allowed to take up their seats; they were all arrested in short order. For all intents and purposes, the KPD was \"outlawed\" on the day the Reichstag Fire Decree was issued, and \"completely banned\" as of 6 March, the day after the election.<ref name=Evans>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|authorlink=Richard J.

Since the bill was effectively a constitutional amendment, a [[quorum]] of two-thirds of the entire Reichstag had to be present in order to formally call up the bill. Leaving nothing to chance, Reichstag President [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] did not count the KPD seats for purposes of obtaining the required quorum. This led historian [[Richard J. Evans]] to contend that the Enabling Act had been passed in a manner contrary to law. The Nazis did not need to count the KPD deputies for purposes of getting a supermajority of two-thirds of those deputies present and voting. However, Evans argued, not counting the KPD deputies for purposes of a quorum amounted to \"refusing to recognize their existence\", and was thus \"an illegal act\".<ref name=Evans/>\n\nThe KPD was efficiently suppressed by the Nazis. The most senior KPD leaders were [[Wilhelm Pieck]] and [[Walter Ulbricht]], who went into exile in the Soviet Union. The KPD maintained an underground organisation in Germany throughout the Nazi period, but the loss of many core members severely weakened the Party's infrastructure.\n\n==Purge of 1937==\nA number of senior KPD leaders in exile were caught up in [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] of 1937\u201338 and executed, among them [[Hugo Eberlein]], [[Heinz Neumann]], [[Hermann Remmele]], [[Fritz Schulte]] and [[Hermann Schubert (German communist)|Hermann Schubert]], or sent to the [[gulag]], like [[Margarete Buber-Neumann]]. Still others, like [[Gustav von Wangenheim]] and [[Erich Mielke]] (later the head of the Stasi in East Germany), denounced their fellow exiles to the [[NKVD]].<ref>Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror'', 576-77.</ref> [[Willi M\u00fcnzenberg]], the KPD's propaganda chief, was murdered in mysterious circumstances in France in 1940. The NKVD is believed to have been responsible.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Postwar history==\nIn East Germany, the Soviet [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|occupation authorities]] forced the eastern branch of the SPD to [[Merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany|merge]] with the KPD (led by Pieck and Ulbricht) to form the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) in April 1946.<ref>Eric D. Weitz, ''Creating German Communism, 1890\u20131990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997</ref> Although nominally a union of equals, the SED quickly fell under Communist domination, and most of the more recalcitrant members from the SPD side of the merger were pushed out in short order. By the time of the formal formation of the East German state in 1949, the SED was a full-fledged Communist party, and developed along lines similar to other Soviet-bloc Communist parties.<ref>David Priestand, ''Red Flag: A History of Communism'',\" New York: Grove Press, 2009</ref> It was the ruling party in East Germany from its formation in 1949 until 1989. The SPD managed to preserve its independence in Berlin, forcing the SED to form a small branch in West Berlin, the [[Socialist Unity Party of West Berlin]].\n\nThe KPD reorganised in the western part of Germany, and received 5.7% of the vote in the [[1949 German federal election|first Bundestag election]] in 1949. But the onset of the [[Cold War]] and imposition of an undisguised Communist dictatorship in East Germany soon caused a collapse in the party's support. At the [[1953 German federal election|1953 election]] the KPD only won 2.2 percent of the total votes and lost all of its seats, never to return. The party was banned in August 1956 by the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]].<ref>Eric D. Weitz, ''Creating German Communism, 1890\u20131990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997</ref> The decision was upheld by the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] in ''[[Communist Party of Germany v. the Federal Republic of Germany]]''.  The ban was due to the aggressive and combative methods that the party used as a \"Marxist-Leninist party struggle\" to achieve their goals. \n\nAfter the party was declared illegal, many of its members continued to function clandestinely despite increased government surveillance. Part of its membership refounded the party in 1968 as the [[German Communist Party]] (DKP). Following [[German reunification]] many DKP members joined the new [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]], formed out of the remains of the SED. In 1968, a self-named \"true successor\" to the (banned) West German KPD was formed, the [[Communist Party of Germany/Marxists-Leninists|KPD/ML]] (Marxist\u2013Leninist), which followed [[Maoism|Maoist]] ideas. It went through multiple splits and united with a Trotskyist group in 1986 to form the [[Unified Socialist Party (Germany)|Unified Socialist Party]] (VSP), which failed to gain any influence and dissolved in the early 1990s.<ref>Eric D. Weitz, ''Creating German Communism, 1890\u20131990: From Popular Protests to Socialist State''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997</ref> However, multiple tiny splinter groups originating in the KPD/ML still exist, several of which claim the name of KPD. [[Communist Party of Germany (1990)|Another]] party with this name was formed in 1990 in East Berlin by several hardline Communists who had been expelled from the PDS, including [[Erich Honecker]]. The \"KPD (Bolshevik)\" split off from the East German KPD in 2005, bringing the total number of (more or less) active KPDs to at least 5. \n\n[[The Left (Germany)|The Left]], formed out of a merger between the PDS and [[Labour and Social Justice \u2013 The Electoral Alternative]] in 2007, claims to be the historical successor of the KPD (by way of the PDS).\n\n==Organization==\n\nIn the early 1920s, the party operated under the principle of [[democratic centralism]], whereby the leading body of the party was the [[Congress]], meeting at least once a year.<ref>Broue, P. (2006) ''The German Revolution: 1917\u20131923'', Chicago: Haymarket Books, pg.635</ref> Between Congresses, leadership of the party resided in the [[Central Committee]], which was elected at the Congress, of one group of people who had to live where the leadership was resident and formed the Zentrale and others nominated from the districts they represented (but also elected at the Congress) who represented the wider party.<ref>Broue, P. (2006) ''The German Revolution: 1917\u20131923'', Chicago: Haymarket Books, pg.635-636</ref> Elected figures were subject to recall by the bodies that elected them.<ref>Broue, P. (2006) ''The German Revolution: 1917\u20131923'', Chicago: Haymarket Books, pg.864&nbsp;\u2014 Broue cites the cases of Freisland and Ernst Meyer as being recalled when their electors were not satisfied with their actions</ref>\n\nThe KPD employed around about 200 full-timers during its early years of existence, and as Broue notes \"They received the pay of an average skilled worker, and had no privileges, apart from being the first to be arrested, prosecuted and sentenced, and when shooting started, to be the first to fall\".<ref>Broue, P.

Sarkar seems to question all objectivity in art, to approach the work as such, the expression of a search.[In his works] We see the misuse of motives, a short prosodic structure, a dry recitative and a rhythmic pattern constitutive of an intimate rumination, the effect of distancing and the search for an intimate cohesion.<ref name=\"News from Africa\">{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217063554/https://news.africa/2017/10/page/497/| title= News Africa| publisher= Le Mauricien |year=2017 | accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref>}}\nIn an interview for Arty Legume, he had indicated his principal poetic influences to be [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] & [[Sylvia Plath]], who taught him, poetic restraint and the 'economy of balance'.\n\nSarkar refuses to be labelled as an artist and remarks that 'there is an inherent difference between craftsmanship and artistry' and instead prefers to be called a 'technician, who picks up the pen or brush to accomplish the job.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. While they have received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, the show's costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. Extensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe show is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. While they have received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, the show's costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. Extensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe show is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

He was the [[2014 IndyCar Series]] champion, and as of 2015 the most successful road and street course race winner in the series' history with 19 wins tied with [[Scott Dixon]]. Power won the [[2018 Indianapolis 500]].<ref>https://www.yahoo.com/news/will-power-wins-2018-indianapolis-500-192538707.html</ref>\n\n==Australian racing==\nPower was born in [[Toowoomba]], [[Queensland]]. The son of open-wheel racer Bob Power, Will Power started his career in Queensland driving a [[Nissan Sunny|Datsun 1200]] at Morgan Park Raceway, Warwick as well as at Carnel Raceway, Stanthorpe. In 1999 Power began driving an ageing family-owned Swift SC92F in the Queensland Formula Ford Championship, winning races in a sporadic campaign. In 2000 Power ran a full campaign leading to his first title in the Swift while simultaneously racing a late-model [[Borland Racing Developments|Spectrum 07]] on the [[Australian Formula Ford Championship]], finishing a promising seventh. Still running a small family-oriented team in 2001, Power upgraded to a Stealth RF95, a Western Australian modification of a 1995 Van Diemen. Power finished second in the series behind the factory-supported Van Diemen driver, [[Will Davison]].\n\nAfter three years of Formula Ford racing, Power moved into [[Formula Holden]], racing for the Graham Watson-owned Ralt Australia team driving a Reynard 94D. Power swept all before him in Formula Holden, winning the title by over 50 points from Stewart McColl, claiming the [[2002 Australian Drivers' Championship]]<ref>[http://www.camsmanual.com.au/pdf/records/1402_CAMS_Gold_Star_Q108.pdf CAMS Online Manual of Motor Sport]</ref> by winning 7 times and achieving 3 [[pole position]]s.<ref>[http://www.f4000.com/thecars.htm The Series \u2013 The Cars] Australian Formula 4000 Championship</ref>\n\nMidway through the 2002 season, Power was given an opportunity to drive for the Bevan Carrick-owned Cooltemp Racing Formula 3 team, driving a Dallara-Toyota as well in the [[Australian Formula 3|Australian Formula 3 Championship]]. Despite missing the opening races, Power missed out on winning the Formula 3 championship by only a handful of points to James Manderson.\n\n==Racing in Europe==\nEurope beckoned and in 2003 Power joined the [[British Formula 3 Championship]] racing initially for Diamond Racing, then later for [[Fortec Motorsport]] as tight funding prevented a full campaign. A second place at Thruxton demonstrated his ability and Power mounted a full campaign in 2004 with [[Alan Docking Racing]] but finished the season in ninth position with five podium finishes.\n\nHe tested a [[Minardi]] Formula One car in 2004 with his Australian Formula Ford and British Formula 3 rival [[Will Davison]] in Italy.<ref>http://www.italiaspeed.com/2004/motorsport/f1/minardi/2711_minardi_test.html</ref>\n\nDuring 2005 he competed in the [[World Series by Renault]] for the [[Carlin Motorsport]] team, where he proved very competitive. During the course of the WSR championship he scored two race victories, with 4 trips to the podium in total and qualified his car on the front row five times. In addition to driving in the WSR, Power was also one of the featured drivers for the [[A1 Team Australia|Australian team]] in the [[2005\u201306 A1 Grand Prix season]].  Power raced in the series opener at [[Brands Hatch]] and piloted Australia to a second-place finish behind [[A1 Team Brazil|Team Brazil]].\n\n==Champ Car==\nIn late 2005 Power joined [[Champ Car]] [[Team Australia]] at the [[2005 Lexmark Indy 300|Lexmark Indy 300]] event at [[Surfers Paradise Street Circuit|Surfers Paradise]] in Australia, which also resulted in his departure from the World Series by Renault championship even though that season was still in progress and Power ultimately ended seventh in the championship.<ref>[http://www.speedsportmag.de/racing/statresults.php?sprache=en&back=formulanissan&sid=173 2005 Formula Renault 3.5 World Series Complete Qualifying and Race Results] SpeedSport Magazine</ref> In the Indy 300 Power ran strongly until being knocked off the track by team mate [[Alex Tagliani]].  After the Surfers Paradise event he signed a multi-year contract to race for the team, which began immediately at the next Champ Car round in [[Mexico City]] after Tagliani's teammate [[Marcus Marshall]] was released for what was described as a \"serious breach of contract\".\n\nPower drove full-time for Team Australia in 2006.  He performed well throughout the season with nine top ten finishes and strong qualifying results.  In Mexico at the final round of the season, Power took his first podium finish in Champ Car. He won the \"rookie of the year\" award<ref>[http://www.champcarworldseries.com/Results/Awards.asp 2006 Roshfrans Rookie Of The Year Standings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010184006/http://www.champcarworldseries.com/Results/Awards.asp |date=10 October 2006 }} Champ Car World Series</ref> and finished in 6th place in the championship standings.\n\nIn his home race in 2006, at Surfers Paradise in Australia, he scored his first pole position of his career in Champ Cars, in front of his home crowd. However, contact from [[Paul Tracy]] in the pit lane and then an ambitious overtaking move by [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]] resulted in a bent left steering arm, and he fell to the back, one lap down by the time the car was repaired, eventually finishing 12th.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.champcarworldseries.com/News/Article.asp?ID=11009 |title=CHAMP CAR WORLD SERIES PRESS CONFERENCE TRANSCRIPT WITH 2006 SERIES CHAMPION SEBASTIEN BOURDAIS |date=22 October 2006 |accessdate=22 October 2006 |publisher=[[Champ Car World Series]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028124109/http://www.champcarworldseries.com/News/Article.asp?ID=11009 |archivedate=28 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 8 April 2007, Power won his first Champ Car race at the inaugural [[IZOD IndyCar World Championship#Fremont Street|Vegas Grand Prix]], held on the streets of [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], United States. He qualified on the pole position and led most laps, becoming the first Australian driver to win in the series. On 8 July, at the Steelback Grand Prix of Toronto, with rain pouring down and visibility near zero when he got behind other cars, Power decided it was time to get aggressive. Power drove from fourth to first in 14 laps, finally splashing past rookie [[Ryan Dalziel]] to take the lead with 23 minutes to go, and went on to an easy victory.\n\nTo get to the lead, Power also had to pass three-time Champ Car World Series champion [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]] and rookie [[Neel Jani]]. Thanks to a series of late caution flags, he was able to go after each of them in turn. \"I was close behind Sebastien and I knew he was quite tentative in the wet and I attacked him,\" Power said. \"I got him on a restart. Then the next restart, I got Neel and the next restart, I got Dalziel. It's just about being aggressive at the right time and not hitting anyone\". \"I just drove so hard here because we've just had so much bad luck in the last few races,\" said Power, whose first Champ Car victory came in the 2007 opener in Las Vegas. \"I didn't care; I just went hard. The car was good in the wet. It was good in the dry, and we stuck it to them.\" Power had podium finishes at Long Beach, Mont-Tremblant and Mexico City and pole positions at Houston, Edmonton, Surfers Paradise and Mexico City to place fourth in the final point standings in 2007.\n\n==IndyCar==\n\n===2008 season===\nThe merger of Champ Car and the [[IndyCar Series|IRL]] left his future uncertain.

He scored two top-five finishes in IndyCar Series races, enough for 12th overall, outpointed by teammate [[Oriol Servi\u00e0]]. In the non-points event in Surfers' Paradise, Australia, Power won the pole position, but crashed out while leading the race.\n\n===2009 season===\n[[Team Penske]] announced on 13 January 2009 that for the 2009 IndyCar Series season, Power would replace [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] at the helm of the No. 3 Team Penske Honda-Dallara while Castroneves attended to his federal tax evasion charges.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/racing/indycar/news/story?id=3829413|title=Power to drive Penske's No. 3 car|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]]|date=13 January 2009|accessdate=6 August 2015|first=John|last=Oreovicz}}</ref> Power drove the No. 3 Team Penske Honda-Dallara to a sixth-place finish in the [[2009 Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg|Grand Prix of St. Petersburg]], the first race of the year. Following St. Petersburg, Castroneves was acquitted of all tax evasion charges and returned to the team for the following race at the [[2009 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach|Grand Prix of Long Beach]]. [[Roger Penske]] came prepared for this scenario, however, and had spare cars on hand for both St. Petersburg and Long Beach, employing the option beginning at Long Beach and continuing through five more races that season. Power's new car, the No. 12 Penske Racing Verizon Wireless Honda/Dallara was officially entered for the Long Beach Grand Prix late on Friday evening and all the setup data garnered from his two sessions in the No. 3 Dallara was successfully transferred over.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/74552|title=Castroneves will race in Long Beach|work=[[Autosport]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=17 April 2009|accessdate=6 August 2015|first=Jeff|last=Olson}}</ref> Power stormed to a dominant pole position with the last-minute effort and ultimately finished 2nd to [[Dario Franchitti]] after leading 16 laps. Power was also entered in the same third car for the Indianapolis 500, in which he finished in fifth place after a pit crew gaffe on the final stop&nbsp;\u2013 while Power was running 2nd&nbsp;\u2013 cost him a shot at Castroneves for the victory. To reward Power for his efforts, he was retained by the team to drive in five more races in Toronto, Edmonton, Kentucky, Sonoma and Homestead. His team being crewed by Penske's [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] team, as Power's races were specifically scheduled on their RSCS off-weekends. Power's dreams and efforts came to fruition when he captured his first IndyCar race win, driving the No. 12, in dominant fashion at the [[2009 Rexall Edmonton Indy|Rexall Edmonton Indy]].\n\nPower's season was brought to an abrupt close during practice for the 2009 Motorola Indy 300 in Sonoma however, as [[Nelson Philippe]] spun exiting Turn 3 and stalled in the middle of the racing groove. As turn 3 is a completely blind corner, taken at high speed while cresting a hill, oncoming drivers had no indication there was anything over the hill and no time to react once they got there. [[E. J. Viso]] could barely avoid him, making light contact, but Power, following just behind Viso, had nowhere to go and crashed heavily into Philippe. Both drivers were airlifted from the racetrack in short order. Power had two [[Back injury|fractured vertebrae]] while Philippe suffered a fractured ankle. Both drivers were concussed in the incident and were hospitalised. Both drivers' injuries would cause them to miss the rest of [[2009 IndyCar Series season|2009 season]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/78033|title=Injury ends Power's season early|work=[[Autosport]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=27 August 2009|accessdate=6 August 2015|first=Steven|last=English}}</ref>\n\n===2010 season===\nOn 19 November 2009, Team Penske announced that Power would join the team full-time for the 2010 season with sponsorship from [[Verizon Wireless]]. Power opened the season in dominant fashion, winning the first two races of the 2010 season at Brazil and St. Petersburg, making him the first IndyCar driver since [[Sam Hornish Jr.]] in 2001 to win the first two events of the year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/sports/autoracing/article1083616.ece|title=Will Power returns to Victory Lane at Grand Prix of St. Petersburg|date=29 March 2010|accessdate=6 August 2015|first=Greg|last=Auman|work=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]|publisher=[[Times Publishing Company]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011161457/http://www.tampabay.com/sports/autoracing/article1083616.ece|archivedate=11 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He went on to win from the pole at [[Watkins Glen International]], giving Roger Penske his first IndyCar Series win at the historic track.

Blethen, [[The Seattle Times Company]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> eight pole positions. Power's efforts were rewarded with triumph in the Mario Andretti Road Course Championship, winning the inaugural [[Mario Andretti]] Trophy as the road course champion for the [[2010 IndyCar Series season]].\n\n===2011 season===\nDuring the [[2011 IndyCar Series season]] he won 6 races; [[2011 Indy Grand Prix of Alabama|Barber Motorsports Park]], [[2011 S\u00e3o Paulo Indy 300|S\u00e3o Paulo]], the second doubleheader event at [[2011 Firestone Twin 275s|Texas Motor Speedway]], [[2011 Edmonton Indy|Edmonton City Center Airport]], [[2011 Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma|Infineon Raceway]], and the inaugural [[2011 Baltimore Grand Prix (IndyCar)|Baltimore Grand Prix]]. However, his season was far from easy. At Toronto he and championship leader [[Dario Franchitti]] touched in Turn 3 while battling for 5th, resulting in a spin for Power, which put him midpack where he was hit by [[Walker Racing|former teammate]] [[Alex Tagliani]]. Power was irate with both drivers, particularly Franchitti, who with some level of controversy was not penalised for the contact and won the race.\n\nWith a few laps to go during the IndyCar Series' 225-mile return to [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]], amid protests from drivers and teams to not restart because of wet track conditions, the race was restarted and Power caught in the ensuing melee started by a spinning [[Danica Patrick]]. An irate Power exited his vehicle and spoke with several officials, even consulting with his race strategist [[Tim Cindric]] before displaying [[the finger]] to IndyCar director of competition [[Brian Barnhart]]. Power's immortal obscene gesture was captured on live television and met with immense support from IndyCar Series fans as well as support from members of several other team organisations in the paddock. Power's \"Double Angry Birds\" gesture, however, ended up landing him with a $30,000 fine, payable through public services to the league, although team owner [[Roger Penske]] said he would gladly pay the fine off. Power won the pole at the [[Kentucky Speedway]] and led the first 48 laps until he had contact with rookie [[Ana Beatriz]] as he exited his pit box.\n\nThe resulting damage relegated him to 19th place, while title rival Franchitti led the most laps, finished 2nd, and took an 18-point advantage. Power's season ended in a violent, high-speed 15-car crash at [[2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championship|the final race of the season in Las Vegas]] that claimed the life of British driver [[Dan Wheldon]]. Wheldon, Power and 3 other drivers were taken to the hospital. He lost any chance of having the points championship after the wreck, due in part to his role in the accident (his car was damaged beyond repair) and also to the fact that the race was abandoned following the wreck. Power was later diagnosed with a [[vertebral compression fracture]] in his [[thoracic vertebrae]] and had surgery to correct the problem.\n\n===2012 season===\nFor the [[2012 IndyCar Series season]], Power returned to Team Penske to once again pilot the No. 12 car with teammates Castroneves and Briscoe. The road and street course heavy 2012 schedule played into Power's strength, making him one of the pre-season favorites to win the championship. After opening the season with a seventh-place finish at St. Petersburg, Power scored three consecutive victories at Barber Motorsports Park, the streets of Long Beach, and the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo to vault into the championship lead. Power held onto the points lead until the tenth of fifteen races, when rival driver [[Ryan Hunter-Reay]] scored his third of three consecutive wins to take over the lead. Power regained the lead and built a 36-point advantage with two races remaining after strong second-place finishes at Mid-Ohio and Sonoma, coupled with two misfortunate finishes by Hunter-Reay. The season's penultimate race on the streets of Baltimore saw Power and Hunter-Reay choosing different strategies when rain began falling.\n\nElecting to remain on slick tires despite the wet conditions, Hunter-Reay gained the track position necessary to earn a much-needed win, while Power finished sixth. With the lead cut to 17 points entering the [[MAVTV 500]] season finale on the 2-mile [[Auto Club Speedway]] in Fontana, California, Power was well positioned to earn his first championship. Those hopes took a huge hit when Power's car spun and hit the wall on lap 55 of the 250-lap race. Despite heavy damage, Team Penske got Power's car back on track long enough to gain an additional position, forcing Hunter-Reay to finish fifth or better to win the championship. Hunter-Reay ran outside of championship position for most of the race but finally moved into the top five with 21 laps remaining, eventually finishing fourth. Hunter-Reay's championship resulted in Power finishing second in the standings for the third consecutive season. Despite losing the overall championship, Power won for the third time the Mario Andretti Trophy as the 2012 road course champion.\n\n===2013 season===\nThe 2013 season began very slowly for Power. In St. Petersburg, during a caution period, his car was run over by [[J. R. Hildebrand]]'s, resulting in damage to both cars; Power was relegated to a 16th-place finish. In Barber, he finished 5th. In S\u00e3o Paulo, a blown engine and fire on the frontstretch forced him to end his day early. He was competitive in Indianapolis, but he was not a factor in the race. He was involved in a crash in Detroit that took out several other cars, yet he still remained in the top ten in points. Things started to pick up after Mid-Ohio. In Sonoma, after Scott Dixon collided with one of his crew members, Dixon was forced to make a drive-through penalty, handing the lead of the race to Will Power. He led the next 12 laps en route to his first win of 2013. He again collided with Scott Dixon in Baltimore that ended up having the bad end for Dixon. In Houston on Saturday, Will Power and Scott Dixon battled all day until lap 64, when a slow pit stop cost him the win. Scott Dixon ended up winning that day. Power's teammate, Helio Castroneves, had troubles throughout the day. On Sunday, Power avenged Dixon, as he dominated the race and won over Dixon. However, the win was overshadowed by Dixon's teammate, Dario Franchitti, crashing on the final lap. Power won the season finale in Fontana to end 2013 on a hot streak, winning 3 out of the last 5 races. He finished 4th in points for the season.\n\n===2014 season===\nPower won the 2014 season-opener in St. Petersburg after passing pole-sitter [[Takuma Sato]] (2017 Indianapolis 500 winner) on lap 31. However, controversy arose during the race when, with 28 laps remaining, Power seemed to slow down, bunching the field and causing [[Jack Hawksworth]] to crash into [[Marco Andretti]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Estrada|first=Chris|url=http://motorsportstalk.nbcsports.com/2014/03/30/will-power-opens-indycar-season-with-st-pete-win/|title=Will Power opens IndyCar season with St. Pete win|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=30 March 2014|accessdate=30 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn Long Beach, after some controversy between him and [[Simon Pagenaud]], he finished 2nd behind Mike Conway. At Barber, mistakes cost him a shot at victory lane. In the GP of Indianapolis, a pit road penalty cost him a win. In the Indianapolis 500, he was merely a factor in the race. In the first of 2 races at Detroit, Power battled hard with [[Graham Rahal]] in the closing laps, but came home with the victory for hometown Roger Penske, his team owner. The second day, his teammate won. At Texas, again a pit road penalty cost him yet another trophy, but he rallied back to finish 2nd in a dramatic finish.\n\nIn the final race at Fontana, Power drove on to finish in ninth and won his first IndyCar championship, 62 points ahead of H\u00e9lio Castroneves in the standings. Power broke down in tears as he stood on the championship podium.\n\n===2015 season===\n[[File:Will Power - GoPro Grand Prix 2015 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|Power won the Verizon P1 Award for taking the pole at the 2015 GoPro Grand Prix.]]\nPower had a difficult [[2015 IndyCar Series]] season, but somehow managed to finish third in the championship in spite of several incidents, including being taken out completely without fault on consecutive ovals. Showing flashes of speed he for example took pole for the season double points finale at [[2015 GoPro Grand Prix of Sonoma|Sonoma]]. He broke a record and clocked 1:16.2597, at an average speed of {{convert|112.589|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref name=SVS1>{{cite web|last1=Stierch|first1=Sarah|title=Will Power takes the pole at Sonoma|url=http://sonomasun.com/2015/08/29/will-power-takes-the-pole-at-sonoma/|website=What's Happening|publisher=Sonoma Valley Sun|accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref> As it was, a win would have taken him ahead of eventual champion [[Scott Dixon]], but would not have been enough to put him ahead of team mate. The duo of Power and [[Juan Pablo Montoya]]. collided during the race, ending Power's championship chances.\n\nThe vast majority of Power's success in IndyCar has been on the road and street courses, where he has often shown great speed during qualifying and races. Although he won the second leg at [[Firestone 600|Texas Motor Speedway]], the general inability to squeeze out ovals wins hampered Power in his first three title runs. In [[2014 IndyCar Series season|2014]] he won at the miler in [[ABC Supply Wisconsin 250|Milwaukee]] and finished second at Texas, helping him to seal his first title. At the end of 2015 Power had won three oval races, one each on long, intermediate and short ovals, with the 19 road course wins being spread out over ten wins on street courses and nine on runoff road courses, with two of those being at the hybrid airport track in [[Edmonton Indy|Edmonton]]. Being more seasoned on ovals Power came close to winning the [[2015 Indianapolis 500]] on his eighth attempt only just losing out to team mate Juan Pablo Montoya.\n\n=== 2016 season ===\nPower missed the season-opening race at St. Petersburg due to the medical team believing that he had a concussion stemming from an accident that he had in one of the practices leading up to the race; it turned out that he did not have a concussion (it could have been an ear or sinus infection that was causing the concussion-like symptoms).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://sports.usatoday.com/2016/03/16/will-power-concussion-decision-not-race-st-petersburg/|title=Will Power agreed with decision to miss St. Petersburg race despite not having concussion|date=2016-03-16|work=USA TODAY Sports|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}</ref> Despite this setback, Power would go on to finish second in the points behind his teammate Simon Pagenaud and won 4 of the 16 races that year: the second race at Detroit (Belle Isle), Road America, Toronto, and Pocono.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/drivdet/powerwi01/2016/O|title=Driver Will Power 2016 Verizon IndyCar Series Results - Racing-Reference.info|website=racing-reference.info|access-date=2018-05-29}}</ref>\n\n=== 2017 season ===\nPower's 2017 season was not as good as his 2016 season, despite not missing any races.

He was the [[2014 IndyCar Series]] champion, and as of 2015 the most successful road and street course race winner in the series' history with 19 wins tied with [[Scott Dixon]]. Power won the [[2018 Indianapolis 500]].<ref>https://www.yahoo.com/news/will-power-wins-2018-indianapolis-500-192538707.html</ref>\n\n==Australian racing==\nPower was born in [[Toowoomba]], [[Queensland]]. The son of open-wheel racer Bob Power, Will Power started his career in Queensland driving a [[Nissan Sunny|Datsun 1200]] at Morgan Park Raceway, Warwick as well as at Carnel Raceway, Stanthorpe. In 1999 Power began driving an ageing family-owned Swift SC92F in the Queensland Formula Ford Championship, winning races in a sporadic campaign. In 2000 Power ran a full campaign leading to his first title in the Swift while simultaneously racing a late-model [[Borland Racing Developments|Spectrum 07]] on the [[Australian Formula Ford Championship]], finishing a promising seventh. Still running a small family-oriented team in 2001, Power upgraded to a Stealth RF95, a Western Australian modification of a 1995 Van Diemen. Power finished second in the series behind the factory-supported Van Diemen driver, [[Will Davison]].\n\nAfter three years of Formula Ford racing, Power moved into [[Formula Holden]], racing for the Graham Watson-owned Ralt Australia team driving a Reynard 94D. Power swept all before him in Formula Holden, winning the title by over 50 points from Stewart McColl, claiming the [[2002 Australian Drivers' Championship]]<ref>[http://www.camsmanual.com.au/pdf/records/1402_CAMS_Gold_Star_Q108.pdf CAMS Online Manual of Motor Sport]</ref> by winning 7 times and achieving 3 [[pole position]]s.<ref>[http://www.f4000.com/thecars.htm The Series \u2013 The Cars] Australian Formula 4000 Championship</ref>\n\nMidway through the 2002 season, Power was given an opportunity to drive for the Bevan Carrick-owned Cooltemp Racing Formula 3 team, driving a Dallara-Toyota as well in the [[Australian Formula 3|Australian Formula 3 Championship]]. Despite missing the opening races, Power missed out on winning the Formula 3 championship by only a handful of points to James Manderson.\n\n==Racing in Europe==\nEurope beckoned and in 2003 Power joined the [[British Formula 3 Championship]] racing initially for Diamond Racing, then later for [[Fortec Motorsport]] as tight funding prevented a full campaign. A second place at Thruxton demonstrated his ability and Power mounted a full campaign in 2004 with [[Alan Docking Racing]] but finished the season in ninth position with five podium finishes.\n\nHe tested a [[Minardi]] Formula One car in 2004 with his Australian Formula Ford and British Formula 3 rival [[Will Davison]] in Italy.<ref>http://www.italiaspeed.com/2004/motorsport/f1/minardi/2711_minardi_test.html</ref>\n\nDuring 2005 he competed in the [[World Series by Renault]] for the [[Carlin Motorsport]] team, where he proved very competitive. During the course of the WSR championship he scored two race victories, with 4 trips to the podium in total and qualified his car on the front row five times. In addition to driving in the WSR, Power was also one of the featured drivers for the [[A1 Team Australia|Australian team]] in the [[2005\u201306 A1 Grand Prix season]].  Power raced in the series opener at [[Brands Hatch]] and piloted Australia to a second-place finish behind [[A1 Team Brazil|Team Brazil]].\n\n==Champ Car==\nIn late 2005 Power joined [[Champ Car]] [[Team Australia]] at the [[2005 Lexmark Indy 300|Lexmark Indy 300]] event at [[Surfers Paradise Street Circuit|Surfers Paradise]] in Australia, which also resulted in his departure from the World Series by Renault championship even though that season was still in progress and Power ultimately ended seventh in the championship.<ref>[http://www.speedsportmag.de/racing/statresults.php?sprache=en&back=formulanissan&sid=173 2005 Formula Renault 3.5 World Series Complete Qualifying and Race Results] SpeedSport Magazine</ref> In the Indy 300 Power ran strongly until being knocked off the track by team mate [[Alex Tagliani]].  After the Surfers Paradise event he signed a multi-year contract to race for the team, which began immediately at the next Champ Car round in [[Mexico City]] after Tagliani's teammate [[Marcus Marshall]] was released for what was described as a \"serious breach of contract\".\n\nPower drove full-time for Team Australia in 2006.  He performed well throughout the season with nine top ten finishes and strong qualifying results.  In Mexico at the final round of the season, Power took his first podium finish in Champ Car. He won the \"rookie of the year\" award<ref>[http://www.champcarworldseries.com/Results/Awards.asp 2006 Roshfrans Rookie Of The Year Standings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010184006/http://www.champcarworldseries.com/Results/Awards.asp |date=10 October 2006 }} Champ Car World Series</ref> and finished in 6th place in the championship standings.\n\nIn his home race in 2006, at Surfers Paradise in Australia, he scored his first pole position of his career in Champ Cars, in front of his home crowd. However, contact from [[Paul Tracy]] in the pit lane and then an ambitious overtaking move by [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]] resulted in a bent left steering arm, and he fell to the back, one lap down by the time the car was repaired, eventually finishing 12th.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.champcarworldseries.com/News/Article.asp?ID=11009 |title=CHAMP CAR WORLD SERIES PRESS CONFERENCE TRANSCRIPT WITH 2006 SERIES CHAMPION SEBASTIEN BOURDAIS |date=22 October 2006 |accessdate=22 October 2006 |publisher=[[Champ Car World Series]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028124109/http://www.champcarworldseries.com/News/Article.asp?ID=11009 |archivedate=28 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 8 April 2007, Power won his first Champ Car race at the inaugural [[IZOD IndyCar World Championship#Fremont Street|Vegas Grand Prix]], held on the streets of [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], United States. He qualified on the pole position and led most laps, becoming the first Australian driver to win in the series. On 8 July, at the Steelback Grand Prix of Toronto, with rain pouring down and visibility near zero when he got behind other cars, Power decided it was time to get aggressive. Power drove from fourth to first in 14 laps, finally splashing past rookie [[Ryan Dalziel]] to take the lead with 23 minutes to go, and went on to an easy victory.\n\nTo get to the lead, Power also had to pass three-time Champ Car World Series champion [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]] and rookie [[Neel Jani]]. Thanks to a series of late caution flags, he was able to go after each of them in turn. \"I was close behind Sebastien and I knew he was quite tentative in the wet and I attacked him,\" Power said. \"I got him on a restart. Then the next restart, I got Neel and the next restart, I got Dalziel. It's just about being aggressive at the right time and not hitting anyone\". \"I just drove so hard here because we've just had so much bad luck in the last few races,\" said Power, whose first Champ Car victory came in the 2007 opener in Las Vegas. \"I didn't care; I just went hard. The car was good in the wet. It was good in the dry, and we stuck it to them.\" Power had podium finishes at Long Beach, Mont-Tremblant and Mexico City and pole positions at Houston, Edmonton, Surfers Paradise and Mexico City to place fourth in the final point standings in 2007.\n\n==IndyCar==\n\n===2008 season===\nThe merger of Champ Car and the [[IndyCar Series|IRL]] left his future uncertain. Power's Walker Racing team announced they would not be making the switch from Champ Car to IRL due to a lack of sponsorship.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wthr.com/story/7989583/walker-racing-wont-be-making-switch-to-indy-car|title=Walker Racing won't be making switch to Indy Car|date=10 March 2008|accessdate=6 August 2015|work=[[WTHR]]|publisher=[[Dispatch Broadcast Group]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> However, Power later signed with KV Racing Technology, to drive the No. 8 Aussie Vineyards\u2014Team Australia car in 2008, continuing to work with Team Australia boss [[Craig Gore]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.crash.net/indycar/news/25823/1/kv-confirms-second-entry.html|title=KV confirms Team Australia tie-up|work=Crash.net|publisher=Crash Media Group|date=13 March 2008|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nPower won the final Champ Car race at Long Beach in 2008, also giving Power his first IndyCar Series win. He scored two top-five finishes in IndyCar Series races, enough for 12th overall, outpointed by teammate [[Oriol Servi\u00e0]]. In the non-points event in Surfers' Paradise, Australia, Power won the pole position, but crashed out while leading the race.\n\n===2009 season===\n[[Team Penske]] announced on 13 January 2009 that for the 2009 IndyCar Series season, Power would replace [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] at the helm of the No. 3 Team Penske Honda-Dallara while Castroneves attended to his federal tax evasion charges.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/racing/indycar/news/story?id=3829413|title=Power to drive Penske's No. 3 car|work=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=[[ESPN Inc.]]|date=13 January 2009|accessdate=6 August 2015|first=John|last=Oreovicz}}</ref> Power drove the No. 3 Team Penske Honda-Dallara to a sixth-place finish in the [[2009 Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg|Grand Prix of St. Petersburg]], the first race of the year. Following St. Petersburg, Castroneves was acquitted of all tax evasion charges and returned to the team for the following race at the [[2009 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach|Grand Prix of Long Beach]]. [[Roger Penske]] came prepared for this scenario, however, and had spare cars on hand for both St. Petersburg and Long Beach, employing the option beginning at Long Beach and continuing through five more races that season. Power's new car, the No. 12 Penske Racing Verizon Wireless Honda/Dallara was officially entered for the Long Beach Grand Prix late on Friday evening and all the setup data garnered from his two sessions in the No. 3 Dallara was successfully transferred over.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/74552|title=Castroneves will race in Long Beach|work=[[Autosport]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=17 April 2009|accessdate=6 August 2015|first=Jeff|last=Olson}}</ref> Power stormed to a dominant pole position with the last-minute effort and ultimately finished 2nd to [[Dario Franchitti]] after leading 16 laps. Power was also entered in the same third car for the Indianapolis 500, in which he finished in fifth place after a pit crew gaffe on the final stop&nbsp;\u2013 while Power was running 2nd&nbsp;\u2013 cost him a shot at Castroneves for the victory. To reward Power for his efforts, he was retained by the team to drive in five more races in Toronto, Edmonton, Kentucky, Sonoma and Homestead. His team being crewed by Penske's [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] team, as Power's races were specifically scheduled on their RSCS off-weekends. Power's dreams and efforts came to fruition when he captured his first IndyCar race win, driving the No. 12, in dominant fashion at the [[2009 Rexall Edmonton Indy|Rexall Edmonton Indy]].\n\nPower's season was brought to an abrupt close during practice for the 2009 Motorola Indy 300 in Sonoma however, as [[Nelson Philippe]] spun exiting Turn 3 and stalled in the middle of the racing groove. As turn 3 is a completely blind corner, taken at high speed while cresting a hill, oncoming drivers had no indication there was anything over the hill and no time to react once they got there. [[E. J. Viso]] could barely avoid him, making light contact, but Power, following just behind Viso, had nowhere to go and crashed heavily into Philippe. Both drivers were airlifted from the racetrack in short order. Power had two [[Back injury|fractured vertebrae]] while Philippe suffered a fractured ankle. Both drivers were concussed in the incident and were hospitalised. Both drivers' injuries would cause them to miss the rest of [[2009 IndyCar Series season|2009 season]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/78033|title=Injury ends Power's season early|work=[[Autosport]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=27 August 2009|accessdate=6 August 2015|first=Steven|last=English}}</ref>\n\n===2010 season===\nOn 19 November 2009, Team Penske announced that Power would join the team full-time for the 2010 season with sponsorship from [[Verizon Wireless]]. Power opened the season in dominant fashion, winning the first two races of the 2010 season at Brazil and St. Petersburg, making him the first IndyCar driver since [[Sam Hornish Jr.]] in 2001 to win the first two events of the year.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/sports/autoracing/article1083616.ece|title=Will Power returns to Victory Lane at Grand Prix of St. Petersburg|date=29 March 2010|accessdate=6 August 2015|first=Greg|last=Auman|work=[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]|publisher=[[Times Publishing Company]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011161457/http://www.tampabay.com/sports/autoracing/article1083616.ece|archivedate=11 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He went on to win from the pole at [[Watkins Glen International]], giving Roger Penske his first IndyCar Series win at the historic track. Over the course of the season, Power scored five wins (all on road courses) and a record<ref>{{cite news|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/sports/2012690126_apcarirlsonomaqualifying.html|title=Power makes it a record 8 poles in 2010|date=21 August 2010|accessdate=6 August 2015|first=John|last=Marshall|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|publisher=Frank A. Blethen, [[The Seattle Times Company]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> eight pole positions. Power's efforts were rewarded with triumph in the Mario Andretti Road Course Championship, winning the inaugural [[Mario Andretti]] Trophy as the road course champion for the [[2010 IndyCar Series season]].\n\n===2011 season===\nDuring the [[2011 IndyCar Series season]] he won 6 races; [[2011 Indy Grand Prix of Alabama|Barber Motorsports Park]], [[2011 S\u00e3o Paulo Indy 300|S\u00e3o Paulo]], the second doubleheader event at [[2011 Firestone Twin 275s|Texas Motor Speedway]], [[2011 Edmonton Indy|Edmonton City Center Airport]], [[2011 Indy Grand Prix of Sonoma|Infineon Raceway]], and the inaugural [[2011 Baltimore Grand Prix (IndyCar)|Baltimore Grand Prix]]. However, his season was far from easy. At Toronto he and championship leader [[Dario Franchitti]] touched in Turn 3 while battling for 5th, resulting in a spin for Power, which put him midpack where he was hit by [[Walker Racing|former teammate]] [[Alex Tagliani]]. Power was irate with both drivers, particularly Franchitti, who with some level of controversy was not penalised for the contact and won the race.\n\nWith a few laps to go during the IndyCar Series' 225-mile return to [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]], amid protests from drivers and teams to not restart because of wet track conditions, the race was restarted and Power caught in the ensuing melee started by a spinning [[Danica Patrick]]. An irate Power exited his vehicle and spoke with several officials, even consulting with his race strategist [[Tim Cindric]] before displaying [[the finger]] to IndyCar director of competition [[Brian Barnhart]]. Power's immortal obscene gesture was captured on live television and met with immense support from IndyCar Series fans as well as support from members of several other team organisations in the paddock. Power's \"Double Angry Birds\" gesture, however, ended up landing him with a $30,000 fine, payable through public services to the league, although team owner [[Roger Penske]] said he would gladly pay the fine off. Power won the pole at the [[Kentucky Speedway]] and led the first 48 laps until he had contact with rookie [[Ana Beatriz]] as he exited his pit box.\n\nThe resulting damage relegated him to 19th place, while title rival Franchitti led the most laps, finished 2nd, and took an 18-point advantage. Power's season ended in a violent, high-speed 15-car crash at [[2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championship|the final race of the season in Las Vegas]] that claimed the life of British driver [[Dan Wheldon]]. Wheldon, Power and 3 other drivers were taken to the hospital. He lost any chance of having the points championship after the wreck, due in part to his role in the accident (his car was damaged beyond repair) and also to the fact that the race was abandoned following the wreck. Power was later diagnosed with a [[vertebral compression fracture]] in his [[thoracic vertebrae]] and had surgery to correct the problem.\n\n===2012 season===\nFor the [[2012 IndyCar Series season]], Power returned to Team Penske to once again pilot the No. 12 car with teammates Castroneves and Briscoe. The road and street course heavy 2012 schedule played into Power's strength, making him one of the pre-season favorites to win the championship. After opening the season with a seventh-place finish at St. Petersburg, Power scored three consecutive victories at Barber Motorsports Park, the streets of Long Beach, and the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo to vault into the championship lead. Power held onto the points lead until the tenth of fifteen races, when rival driver [[Ryan Hunter-Reay]] scored his third of three consecutive wins to take over the lead. Power regained the lead and built a 36-point advantage with two races remaining after strong second-place finishes at Mid-Ohio and Sonoma, coupled with two misfortunate finishes by Hunter-Reay. The season's penultimate race on the streets of Baltimore saw Power and Hunter-Reay choosing different strategies when rain began falling.\n\nElecting to remain on slick tires despite the wet conditions, Hunter-Reay gained the track position necessary to earn a much-needed win, while Power finished sixth. With the lead cut to 17 points entering the [[MAVTV 500]] season finale on the 2-mile [[Auto Club Speedway]] in Fontana, California, Power was well positioned to earn his first championship. Those hopes took a huge hit when Power's car spun and hit the wall on lap 55 of the 250-lap race. Despite heavy damage, Team Penske got Power's car back on track long enough to gain an additional position, forcing Hunter-Reay to finish fifth or better to win the championship. Hunter-Reay ran outside of championship position for most of the race but finally moved into the top five with 21 laps remaining, eventually finishing fourth. Hunter-Reay's championship resulted in Power finishing second in the standings for the third consecutive season. Despite losing the overall championship, Power won for the third time the Mario Andretti Trophy as the 2012 road course champion.\n\n===2013 season===\nThe 2013 season began very slowly for Power. In St. Petersburg, during a caution period, his car was run over by [[J. R. Hildebrand]]'s, resulting in damage to both cars; Power was relegated to a 16th-place finish. In Barber, he finished 5th. In S\u00e3o Paulo, a blown engine and fire on the frontstretch forced him to end his day early. He was competitive in Indianapolis, but he was not a factor in the race. He was involved in a crash in Detroit that took out several other cars, yet he still remained in the top ten in points. Things started to pick up after Mid-Ohio. In Sonoma, after Scott Dixon collided with one of his crew members, Dixon was forced to make a drive-through penalty, handing the lead of the race to Will Power. He led the next 12 laps en route to his first win of 2013. He again collided with Scott Dixon in Baltimore that ended up having the bad end for Dixon. In Houston on Saturday, Will Power and Scott Dixon battled all day until lap 64, when a slow pit stop cost him the win. Scott Dixon ended up winning that day. Power's teammate, Helio Castroneves, had troubles throughout the day. On Sunday, Power avenged Dixon, as he dominated the race and won over Dixon. However, the win was overshadowed by Dixon's teammate, Dario Franchitti, crashing on the final lap. Power won the season finale in Fontana to end 2013 on a hot streak, winning 3 out of the last 5 races. He finished 4th in points for the season.\n\n===2014 season===\nPower won the 2014 season-opener in St. Petersburg after passing pole-sitter [[Takuma Sato]] (2017 Indianapolis 500 winner) on lap 31. However, controversy arose during the race when, with 28 laps remaining, Power seemed to slow down, bunching the field and causing [[Jack Hawksworth]] to crash into [[Marco Andretti]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Estrada|first=Chris|url=http://motorsportstalk.nbcsports.com/2014/03/30/will-power-opens-indycar-season-with-st-pete-win/|title=Will Power opens IndyCar season with St. Pete win|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=30 March 2014|accessdate=30 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn Long Beach, after some controversy between him and [[Simon Pagenaud]], he finished 2nd behind Mike Conway. At Barber, mistakes cost him a shot at victory lane. In the GP of Indianapolis, a pit road penalty cost him a win. In the Indianapolis 500, he was merely a factor in the race. In the first of 2 races at Detroit, Power battled hard with [[Graham Rahal]] in the closing laps, but came home with the victory for hometown Roger Penske, his team owner. The second day, his teammate won. At Texas, again a pit road penalty cost him yet another trophy, but he rallied back to finish 2nd in a dramatic finish.\n\nIn the final race at Fontana, Power drove on to finish in ninth and won his first IndyCar championship, 62 points ahead of H\u00e9lio Castroneves in the standings. Power broke down in tears as he stood on the championship podium.\n\n===2015 season===\n[[File:Will Power - GoPro Grand Prix 2015 - Stierch.jpg|thumb|Power won the Verizon P1 Award for taking the pole at the 2015 GoPro Grand Prix.]]\nPower had a difficult [[2015 IndyCar Series]] season, but somehow managed to finish third in the championship in spite of several incidents, including being taken out completely without fault on consecutive ovals. Showing flashes of speed he for example took pole for the season double points finale at [[2015 GoPro Grand Prix of Sonoma|Sonoma]]. He broke a record and clocked 1:16.2597, at an average speed of {{convert|112.589|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref name=SVS1>{{cite web|last1=Stierch|first1=Sarah|title=Will Power takes the pole at Sonoma|url=http://sonomasun.com/2015/08/29/will-power-takes-the-pole-at-sonoma/|website=What's Happening|publisher=Sonoma Valley Sun|accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref> As it was, a win would have taken him ahead of eventual champion [[Scott Dixon]], but would not have been enough to put him ahead of team mate. The duo of Power and [[Juan Pablo Montoya]]. collided during the race, ending Power's championship chances.\n\nThe vast majority of Power's success in IndyCar has been on the road and street courses, where he has often shown great speed during qualifying and races. Although he won the second leg at [[Firestone 600|Texas Motor Speedway]], the general inability to squeeze out ovals wins hampered Power in his first three title runs. In [[2014 IndyCar Series season|2014]] he won at the miler in [[ABC Supply Wisconsin 250|Milwaukee]] and finished second at Texas, helping him to seal his first title. At the end of 2015 Power had won three oval races, one each on long, intermediate and short ovals, with the 19 road course wins being spread out over ten wins on street courses and nine on runoff road courses, with two of those being at the hybrid airport track in [[Edmonton Indy|Edmonton]]. Being more seasoned on ovals Power came close to winning the [[2015 Indianapolis 500]] on his eighth attempt only just losing out to team mate Juan Pablo Montoya.\n\n=== 2016 season ===\nPower missed the season-opening race at St. Petersburg due to the medical team believing that he had a concussion stemming from an accident that he had in one of the practices leading up to the race; it turned out that he did not have a concussion (it could have been an ear or sinus infection that was causing the concussion-like symptoms).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://sports.usatoday.com/2016/03/16/will-power-concussion-decision-not-race-st-petersburg/|title=Will Power agreed with decision to miss St. Petersburg race despite not having concussion|date=2016-03-16|work=USA TODAY Sports|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}</ref> Despite this setback, Power would go on to finish second in the points behind his teammate Simon Pagenaud and won 4 of the 16 races that year: the second race at Detroit (Belle Isle), Road America, Toronto, and Pocono.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/drivdet/powerwi01/2016/O|title=Driver Will Power 2016 Verizon IndyCar Series Results - Racing-Reference.info|website=racing-reference.info|access-date=2018-05-29}}</ref>\n\n=== 2017 season ===\nPower's 2017 season was not as good as his 2016 season, despite not missing any races.

Certainly, all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. And most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted [...] So should we assume that Ptolemy and Diophantus, Pappus and Hypatia were ethnically Greek, that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians? It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities [...] And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfill numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become \"Hellenized,\" to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case, it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist.''\"</ref> It is almost certain that Hero taught at the [[Musaeum]] which included the famous [[Library of Alexandria]], because most of his writings appear as lecture notes for courses in [[mathematics]], [[mechanics]], [[physics]], and [[pneumatics]].

Certainly, all of them wrote in Greek and were part of the Greek intellectual community of Alexandria. And most modern studies conclude that the Greek community coexisted [...] So should we assume that Ptolemy and Diophantus, Pappus and Hypatia were ethnically Greek, that their ancestors had come from Greece at some point in the past but had remained effectively isolated from the Egyptians? It is, of course, impossible to answer this question definitively. But research in papyri dating from the early centuries of the common era demonstrates that a significant amount of intermarriage took place between the Greek and Egyptian communities [...] And it is known that Greek marriage contracts increasingly came to resemble Egyptian ones. In addition, even from the founding of Alexandria, small numbers of Egyptians were admitted to the privileged classes in the city to fulfill numerous civic roles. Of course, it was essential in such cases for the Egyptians to become \"Hellenized,\" to adopt Greek habits and the Greek language. Given that the Alexandrian mathematicians mentioned here were active several hundred years after the founding of the city, it would seem at least equally possible that they were ethnically Egyptian as that they remained ethnically Greek. In any case, it is unreasonable to portray them with purely European features when no physical descriptions exist.''\"</ref> It is almost certain that Hero taught at the [[Musaeum]] which included the famous [[Library of Alexandria]], because most of his writings appear as lecture notes for courses in [[mathematics]], [[mechanics]], [[physics]], and [[pneumatics]].
