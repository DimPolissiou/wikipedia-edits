Horse-drawn buses were introduced in 1841.\nServices were run by the ''Societ\u00e0 Anonima degli Omnibus'' (SAO), \"Omnibus Anonymous Company\". The company was responsible for 11 bus lines between 1861 and 1865.\n\nFew years later the first horse-drawn trams were introduced: 3 lines were opened in 1881 followed in 1893 by the first electric tramway, built by [[Edison (company)|Edison]] company. Two years later the same company opened 18 more lines, all ruled by municipality offices. Edison's concession on new lines expired in 1917, leaving all the operations to the municipality. Few years later the public offices responsible for public transport operations were made independent, becoming the ''Azienda Tranviaria Municipale'' (ATM) in 1931.\n\nIn the meantime, the first petrol powered bus lines were introduced in 1905, operated by SITA (''Societ\u00e0 Italiana Trasporto con Automobili'') and then moved under control of ATM along with the first [[trolleybus]] line (1933).\n\nAfter [[World War II]] resources were focused on bus lines and, since the mid-1950s, on the new [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]]. [[Milan Metro]] construction began in 1957 and in 1964 the [[Milan Metro Line 1|first line]] was opened. Five years later the [[Milan Metro Line 2|Line 2]] was inaugurated.\n\nOn 1 January 1965, ATM changed its name to \"Azienda Trasporti Municipali\" (''Municipal Transport Company''). In these years a new generation of longer tram (jumbotram) were introduced. In the 1960s Italy and Milan saw a strong increase in car owners, and the increasing importance of private over public transport.\n\nSeveral new stations of the two metro lines are opened in the following years. The new [[Milan Metro Line 3|Line 3]] was inaugurated in 1990.\n<!-- Nel 1990 la terza linea metropolitana (la linea gialla) viene aperta e le altre due vengono prolungate, mentre ATM si dota di vetture meno inquinanti e potenzia il trasporto ad alimentazione elettrica. -->\nTram line 15 to [[Rozzano]] was the first to go beyond the city border in 1992.\n\nATM changed its name again in 1999 to adopt the current one, \"Azienda Trasporti Milanesi\", and it became a [[Societ\u00e0 per Azioni|S.p.a.]] in 2001.  In these years, the first on-demand service, the Radiobus, was introduced to operate during the night.\n\nThe first [[fast tram]] line (Line 7) was introduced on 7 December 2002. This was followed by other 2 on 8 December 2003: Line 4 on the north and Line 15 on the south.\n\nNew magnetic tickets and electronic pass cards were introduced in 2004.
