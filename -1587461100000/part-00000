It was conducted on 12 November 1944 by 29 [[Royal Air Force]] [[heavy bomber]]s that attacked the battleship at its anchorage near the Norwegian city of [[Troms\u00f8 (city)|Troms\u00f8]]. The ship [[capsized]] after being hit by at least two bombs and damaged by the explosions of others, killing between 940 and 1,204 members of the crew; the British suffered no casualties.\n\nThe attack ended a long-running series of air and naval operations against ''Tirpitz'' that sought to eliminate the threat she posed to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] shipping. The battleship had been moved to the Troms\u00f8 area in October 1944 after being crippled on 15 September during [[Operation Paravane]]. This attack had been carried out by the RAF's elite [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|Nos. 9]] and [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|617 Squadrons]], who unsuccessfully attempted to strike ''Tirpitz'' again at Troms\u00f8 on 29 October during [[Operation Obviate]].\n\nOperation Catechism re-used the plans for Operation Obviate, and was conducted by the same squadrons. The aircraft departed from bases in northern Scotland and, due to clear weather conditions, the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] airmen were able to accurately target and bomb the battleship. The bombers were unmolested by [[Jagdgeschwader 5|a unit]] of German [[fighter aircraft]] that failed to take off from nearby Troms\u00f8 in time. One bomber was significantly damaged by anti-aircraft artillery.\n\n''Tirpitz'' capsized within minutes of being hit. Rescuers picked up hundreds of her crew from the water, but few of those trapped within the hull were saved. Several German military personnel were convicted of dereliction of duty following the attack. The battleship's destruction was celebrated in Allied countries and Norway, and is commemorated by several memorials and displays in museums.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz}}\nFrom early 1942, ''Tirpitz'' posed a significant threat to the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Allied convoys]] transporting supplies through the [[Norwegian Sea]] to the [[Soviet Union]]. Stationed in [[fjord]]s on the Norwegian coast, the [[battleship]] was capable of overwhelming the close-escort forces assigned to the Arctic convoys or breaking out into the North Atlantic.{{sfn|Ellis|1999|pp=294\u2013295}} To counter this threat, the Allies needed to keep a powerful force of warships with the British [[Home Fleet]], and [[capital ship]]s accompanied most convoys part of the way to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Bennett|2012|p=9}}{{sfn|Faulkner|Wilkinson|2012|p=109}}\n{{Location map+ | Norway North |relief=1 |width=300\n|float = left\n|caption = Northern Norway and nearby areas of Sweden, Finland and the Soviet Union\n|alt = Map of northern Norway and nearby areas marked with locations mentioned in the article\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Norway North\n    | label = [[Troms\u00f8 (city)|Troms\u00f8]]\n    | lat_deg = 69.68277778\n    | lon_deg = 18.94277778 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Norway North\n    | label = [[K\u00e5fjorden (Alta)|Kaafjord]]\n    | lat_deg = 69.9353\n    | lon_deg = 23.0454 }}\n {{Location map~ | Norway North\n    | label = [[Tornetr\u00e4sk]]\n    | lat_deg = 68.36666667\n    | lon_deg = 19.1 }}\n{{Location map~ | Norway North\n    | label = [[Bardufoss]]\n    | lat_deg = 69.0645\n    | lon_deg = 18.5152}}\n}}\n\n''Tirpitz'' was repeatedly attacked by British forces over several years. [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[heavy bomber]]s made four unsuccessful raids on the battleship between January and April 1942 while she was stationed at [[F\u00e6ttenfjord]].{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=6}} From March 1943, ''Tirpitz'' was based at [[K\u00e5fjorden (Alta)|Kaafjord]] in the far north of Norway. During [[Operation Source]] on 22 September, she was severely damaged by explosives placed on her hull by [[Royal Navy]] personnel who had used [[midget submarine]]s to penetrate Kaafjord.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=6}}{{sfn|Bennett|2012|pp=13\u201314}} On 3 April 1944, aircraft flying from Royal Navy [[aircraft carrier]]s attacked ''Tirpitz'' during [[Operation Tungsten]] and inflicted further damage.{{sfn|Bennett|2012|p=15}} A series of subsequent aircraft carrier attacks were unsuccessful, including [[Operation Mascot]] on 17 July and [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Operation Goodwood]] which was conducted between 22 and 29 August 1944.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=7}}{{sfn|Bennett|2012|p=19}}\n\nAfter the failure of Operation Goodwood, it was decided that further carrier attacks against ''Tirpitz'' would be fruitless due to the inadequacies of the Royal Navy's aircraft and their armament. Accordingly, responsibility for sinking ''Tirpitz'' was transferred to the RAF's [[Bomber Command RAF|Bomber Command]].{{sfn|Roskill|1961|p=161}}{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=85, 89}} On 15 September 1944, the elite [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|Nos. 9]] and [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|617 Squadrons]] attacked the battleship at Kaafjord during what was designated [[Operation Paravane]]. This operation employed [[Avro Lancaster]] heavy bombers armed with [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy]] heavy bombs and \"Johnnie Walker\" [[Naval mine|mines]].{{sfn|Bennett|2012|p=19}} The Tallboy bomb weighed {{convert|12000|lb|kg}} and had been developed to destroy heavily [[Vehicle armour|armoured]] targets. When dropped from a high altitude, the bomb could penetrate a battleship's deck armour before exploding within the vessel.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=16}} ''Tirpitz'' was struck by a single Tallboy during the attack that caused extensive damage to her [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and rendered her unfit for combat.{{sfn|Bennett|2012|p=19}}\n\nAs ''Tirpitz'' could not be repaired and Soviet forces were advancing towards Kaafjord, [[Grand Admiral]] [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], the commander of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (the German Navy), ordered that she be transferred to near the northern Norwegian city of [[Troms\u00f8 (city)|Troms\u00f8]] and used as an immobile battery to defend the area from attack. D\u00f6nitz hoped that this would also convince the Allies that ''Tirpitz'' continued to pose a threat.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=121}}{{sfn|Bishop|2012|pp=340\u2013341}} An anchorage was selected just off the coast of the island of [[H\u00e5k\u00f8ya]] where it was believed the water was shallow enough to prevent the battleship from sinking if another attack was successful.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=341}}{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=77}} ''Tirpitz'' arrived there on 16 October.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=123}} The depth of water at the mooring was found to be greater than anticipated, leaving the battleship vulnerable to capsizing. Because of the space needed by ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s [[torpedo net]]s, it was not possible to move her closer to shore.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=125}}\n\nRAF and Royal Navy reconnaissance aircraft located ''Tirpitz'' at Troms\u00f8 on 18 October.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=77}} As the Allied intelligence services had not been able to confirm that the battleship had been crippled, it was considered necessary to conduct further air raids against her.{{sfn|Zetterling|Tamelander|2009|pp=296\u2013297}} Nos. 9 and 617 Squadrons attacked ''Tirpitz'' on 29 October in what was designated [[Operation Obviate]]. As the Troms\u00f8 area was within range of RAF bases in northern Scotland if the Lancasters were modified, this attack was somewhat simpler to conduct than Operation Paravane. To extend their range, the Lancasters were fitted with extra fuel tanks and more powerful engines, and their forward and mid-upper gun turrets and pilot's armour plate were removed.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=126\u2013127}} The reduction in armament left the Lancasters very vulnerable to German [[fighter aircraft]], and they would have to fly without escort as no British fighters had the range needed to reach Troms\u00f8.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=113}}\n\nDuring Operation Obviate, the bombers flew north over the Norwegian Sea, and met up over [[Tornetr\u00e4sk]] lake in Northern Sweden.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=81}} This violated [[Sweden during World War II|Sweden's neutrality]], but allowed the bombers to approach Troms\u00f8 from the south-east. The Allies believed the Germans would not expect an attack from this direction.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=126}} Despite clear weather for most of the flight, ''Tirpitz'' was covered by cloud shortly before the Lancasters reached the point where they were to release their Tallboy bombs. This made it impossible to accurately target the battleship, and the 33 aircraft which bombed achieved no hits. ''Tirpitz'' was slightly damaged by a near miss. One of the Lancasters made a [[forced landing]] in Sweden after being damaged by anti-aircraft gunfire, and the remainder returned to base.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|pp=80\u201382}}{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=132\u2013134}}\n\n==Preparations==\n===British===\nBomber Command remained determined to sink ''Tirpitz'' as soon as possible, and preparations for another attack began shortly after Operation Obviate.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=132}}{{sfn|Roskill|1961|p=168}} A report issued by the Royal Navy's [[Naval Intelligence Division (United Kingdom)|Naval Intelligence Division]] on 3 November judged that it remained necessary to attack ''Tirpitz'' in northern Norway. The report argued that the battleship could potentially be repaired and made fully operational if she was left unmolested and able to reach a major port. As it would be difficult to target the battleship during the period of [[Polar night|near perpetual darkness]] in the northern winter, further attacks needed to be made within the 23 days before this commenced.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=137}} [[No. 5 Group RAF]] directed on 3 November that the next attack on ''Tirpitz'' was to take place on 5 November, and would re-use the plans developed for Operation Obviate. The raid was designated Operation Catechism.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=137}}\n\nTwo [[de Havilland Mosquito]] meteorological aircraft were stationed at [[RAF Sumburgh]] from 4 November, from where they conducted daily sorties to monitor weather conditions in the Troms\u00f8 area.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=137}}{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=123}} On the same day, twenty No. 9 Squadron and nineteen No. 617 Squadron Lancasters were dispatched to airfields in northern Scotland in preparation for the operation.

In their place, seven fishing boats fitted with smoke generators were positioned near the battleship; these were not capable of generating a smokescreen that could completely cover ''Tirpitz''.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=126}}\n\nThe battleship's crew continued regular training exercises, and remained concerned about further air attacks.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=124}} On 4 November ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s commanding officer Captain [[Wolf Junge]] departed. He was replaced by the executive officer, Captain Robert Weber.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=350}} Weber believed that within three weeks the days would be short enough to prevent further air attacks.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=82}} On 12 November around 1,700 men were on board ''Tirpitz''.{{sfn|Knowles|2018|p=270}}\n\nA force of 38 fighters was transferred to [[Bardufoss]] after Operation Obviate to bolster the Troms\u00f8 region's air defences.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=122}} These aircraft formed part of [[Jagdgeschwader 5]] (JG 5), and were under the temporary command of Major [[Heinrich Ehrler]]. The unit had been evacuated from [[Kirkenes]] in the far northeastern region of Norway as Soviet forces [[Petsamo\u2013Kirkenes Offensive|advanced towards the town]], and was disorganised at the time of Operation Catechism.{{sfn|Zetterling|Tamelander|2009|p=307}} Most of the pilots at Bardufoss were inexperienced and ill-trained, and the unit had not been properly briefed on ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s presence in the area. Ehrler arrived at Bardufoss on 9 November en route to [[Alta (town)|Alta]], and decided to remain there until the morning of 12 November to oversee an emergency training programme for the fighter pilots.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=126}}\n\n==Attack==\n===Departure===\n\nThe decision to launch Operation Catechism was made in the early hours of 12 November. A [[Weather forecasting|weather forecast]] issued on the afternoon of 11 November predicted that clouds might be encountered over northern Norway. One of the Mosquito meteorological aircraft flew over the area that evening, and its crew reported encountering patches of cloud when they returned to Scotland shortly after midnight on the night of 11\u201312 November.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=138}} Nevertheless, the commander of No. 5 Group, Air Commodore [[Ralph Cochrane]], decided to attempt another attack in the hope that the bombers would encounter clear weather over Troms\u00f8. The plan for this operation remained the same as that used in Operation Obviate, with the attack force to use identical routes.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=352}}\n\nA total of 32 Lancasters were dispatched. No. 617 Squadron contributed eighteen bombers, and No. 9 Squadron thirteen. As with Operations Paravane and Obviate, they were joined by a Lancaster fitted out as a film aircraft from [[No. 463 Squadron RAAF]].{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=83}} The role of this aircraft was to collect material for use in [[propaganda]] films.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=89}} Seven No. 9 Squadron Lancasters, including that of its commanding officer Wing Commander [[James Bazin]], were unable to participate, as they could not be cleared in time of the snow and ice that had formed on them overnight.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=352}}{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=125}} The No. 617 Squadron aircraft took off between 2:59 and 3:25&nbsp;am [[British Summer Time|BST]], and the No. 9 Squadron aircraft between 3:00 and 3:35&nbsp;am BST.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=139}} The aircraft flown by No. 9 Squadron's deputy commander, Squadron Leader Bill Williams, was among those able to take off and he assumed command of the unit.{{sfn|Zetterling|Tamelander|2009|p=305}}{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=364}}\n\nThe Lancasters flew individually over the Norwegian Sea. As had been the case during Operation Obviate, they crossed the Norwegian coast between the towns of [[Mosj\u00f8en]] and [[Namsos (town)|Namsos]] where a gap in German radar coverage had been located. Several of the bombers flew too far to the north, and came within range of German radar stations.{{sfn|Zetterling|Tamelander|2009|pp=298, 305}} The attack force rendezvoused over Tornetr\u00e4sk lake.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=352}}{{sfn|Zetterling|Tamelander|2009|p=305}} After making two orbits, No. 617 Squadron's commanding officer, Wing Commander [[James Brian Tait|\"Willie\" Tait]], fired a [[flare gun]] from his aircraft to signal the force to proceed to Troms\u00f8.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=139}} Two No. 9 Squadron Lancasters failed to reach Tornetr\u00e4sk lake in time, and returned to base without attacking.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=352}}{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=83}}\n\n===Approach===\n\nThe attack force proceeded north-west towards Troms\u00f8, and climbed to {{convert|14000|ft|m}} to clear the mountains along the border of Sweden and Norway. They were guided by radio homing signals transmitted by a Norwegian [[Milorg]] agent stationed near the border between the two countries.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|pp=127\u2013128}} By the time they reached the Troms\u00f8 area, both of the squadrons had formed up into loose formations.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=354}} No. 617 Squadron led the attack, followed by No. 9 Squadron.

Between 7:39&nbsp;am and 8:50&nbsp;am BST several observation posts in the area reported sighting Lancasters. As the first aircraft to be spotted were flying east, it was thought that they might be headed to the Soviet Union. ''Tirpitz'' was not notified of the reports until 8:15&nbsp;am BST and few reports were passed on to the JG 5 detachment at Bardufoss. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s air raid siren was sounded at 8:51&nbsp;am, and Weber informed the ship's crew seven minutes later that an attack was possible.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=128}}\n\nAt around 9:15&nbsp;am BST, ''Tirpitz'' contacted Bardufoss to request that fighters be dispatched to provide air cover. This was too late for any of the fighters to reach Troms\u00f8 before the bombers arrived.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=129}} The local Luftwaffe command ordered the fighters to be [[Scrambling (military)|scrambled]] at 9:18&nbsp;am. Due to various delays, the aircraft did not begin taking off from Bardufoss until approximately 9:32&nbsp;am. Ehrler took off first, but the others were delayed from doing so for several minutes while an aircraft landed on the runway. Ehrler proceeded to the Troms\u00f8 area by himself, but was unable to locate the British bombers before they attacked. It is not clear where the other fighters were sent. One post-attack report stated they were sent to the border with Sweden, another that they proceeded to Kaafjord and two pilots claimed to have reached Troms\u00f8 after ''Tirpitz'' was destroyed.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=157\u2013159}}\n\nWeather conditions over Troms\u00f8 continued to be clear when the attack force arrived in the area.

Tait's aircraft was the first to drop its Tallboy, which hit ''Tirpitz''. No. 617 Squadron completed its attack at 9:44&nbsp;am BST with all aircraft bombing. No. 9 Squadron aircraft began dropping their Tallboys at 9:45&nbsp;am BST. By this time the battleship was on fire and covered in smoke.

The historian John Sweetman states that this bomb ricocheted off the side of the ship. William H. Garzke and Robert O.

Despite the list, Weber expected that ''Tirpitz'' would not sink as the water beneath her hull was too shallow.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=85}} Counter flooding proved impossible as the controls for the necessary systems had been abandoned, and the volume of water that was entering the ship was well beyond their ability to fight had they been operational. Weber ordered that the lower decks be evacuated at 9:45&nbsp;am, by which time the list had reached between 30 and 40 degrees.{{sfn|Garzke|Dulin|1985|pp=273\u2013274}} At 9:50&nbsp;am the magazine for \"Caesar\" turret exploded, causing extensive damage. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s list rapidly increased, and she was soon lying on her side. Weber then gave the order to abandon ship.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=85}} The battleship continued to heel over, and capsized at 9:52&nbsp;am.{{sfn|Brown|1977|p=43}} Almost 1,000 of her crew had either been killed by this time, or were trapped inside the hull.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=85}}\n\nThe crews of several Lancasters observed ''Tirpitz'' capsize.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=140}} The No. 463 Squadron film aircraft made a final pass over the battleship at an altitude of just {{convert|50|ft|m}} to capture footage of the event.{{sfn|Nichol|2015|p=263}} Just after 11:00&nbsp;am BST a photo reconnaissance Mosquito overflew the Troms\u00f8 region, and photographed the wreck.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=146}} The [[Secret Intelligence Service]] agent [[Egil Lindberg]] also sent radio reports from Troms\u00f8 confirming that ''Tirpitz'' had been destroyed.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=144}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Rescue efforts===\n[[File:Battlehip Tirpitz capsized at Tromso c1944.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white aerial photograph showing an overturned ship|''Tirpitz'' following Operation Catechism]]\nThe German forces in the Troms\u00f8 area endeavoured to rescue the surviving members of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s crew.

Local Norwegian civilians who owned torches hid them, and only one could be found.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=137}} A total of 87 men were rescued from within the hull in the 24 hours after the attack.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=362}} Cutting continued for two further days, and was finally abandoned when it was assessed that the oxygen supply inside the wreck would have been exhausted; no survivors were recovered during this period.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=362}}{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=137}} Estimates of the total number of sailors and officers killed vary, with the most common figures lying between 940 and 1,204.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=137}} Weber and all of his senior officers were among the dead.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=362}}{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=152}}\n\nMany Norwegian civilians in Troms\u00f8 were pleased that ''Tirpitz'' had been destroyed, not least as it meant the end of an order requiring that they [[billet]] members of her crew. Several civilians who showed pleasure at the event in public were arrested by the [[Gestapo]].{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=145}} Other Norwegians were saddened by the way that the battleship's crew had died.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=141}}\n\nWork began on stripping ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s wreck soon after rescue efforts ended, and continued until the late 1950s. Before the end of the war, German personnel removed the ship's bronze [[propeller]]s and some other components so they could be melted down.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=149}} The wreck was sold to a Norwegian [[scrap]] dealing company in 1948, and was broken up [[in situ]]. Salvage work concluded in 1957, by which time most remnants of the battleship had been removed. The human remains which were recovered from the wreck by scrappers were initially buried alongside unwanted parts of ''Tirpitz'', but this ceased following complaints by a local church minister. The remains of hundreds of others were recovered and buried in Norwegian cemeteries.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=154}}\n\n===Return to base===\nOne of the No. 9 Squadron Lancasters was badly damaged by anti-aircraft gunfire, and its pilot decided to attempt a crash-landing in Sweden. The crew were able to make radio contact with [[Swedish Armed Forces|Swedish military]] forces manning a small airfield at [[Naisj\u00e4rv]], who prepared it for the bomber. When one of the Lancaster's engines cut out while attempting to land, the pilot made a [[belly landing]] in a field near a village.

The two airmen also gave interviews; Tait described the raid in a [[BBC]] broadcast and Williams spoke with American [[CBS]] correspondent [[Edward R. Murrow]].{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=364}} The success of Operation Catechism led to celebrations in Allied countries. ''Tirpitz'' was seen as a symbol of the [[Nazi]] regime, and her destruction provided further evidence that the war was coming to an end. Tait was privately sceptical of the value of the operation though, and later noted in his private papers that it \"had not contributed much to the Allied victory\" as the crippled battleship had not posed a threat.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=370}}\n\nMany of the aircrew involved in Operation Catechism were decorated in recognition of their part in the attack.{{sfn|Nichol|2015|p=273}} Cochrane recommended Tait for the [[Victoria Cross]].

More than half the Home Fleet was deployed elsewhere, including many ships sent to the Pacific to fight Japanese forces.{{sfn|Knowles|2018|p=281}}\n\n==Assessments==\n===German===\nThe loss of ''Tirpitz'' was a disaster for the German military units in northern Norway.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=141}} In addition to the heavy loss of life, the destruction of the battleship left the ''Kriegsmarine'' without any of the capital ships needed to threaten Allied convoy routes.{{sfn|Ellis|Warhurst|1968|p=129}} Ehrler and several personnel assigned to observer posts, anti-aircraft guns and ships were [[court martialled]] and imprisoned.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=160}} Ehrler was convicted in relation to leaving his unit's operations room under the command of a [[non-commissioned officer]] on 12 November. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, but was released after a month and demoted. He was killed in combat on 4 April 1945.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=156\u2013157}} Many commentators and members of JG 5 believe that Ehrler was treated as a [[scapegoat]].{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=156}} D\u00f6nitz also ordered that an inquiry be held into why the battleship capsized. The inquiry concluded that \"the actual depth of the prepared berth did not conform with the requirements and directions of the commander-in-chief\".{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=164\u2013165}}\n\nIt is unclear why the fighters at Bardufoss failed to protect the battleship. Much of the relevant documentation did not survive the war, and accounts from survivors are at times contradictory.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=157}} Sweetman judged that the failure ultimately resulted from the order to intercept the bombers being issued too late, and a lack of clear plans to coordinate the defence.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=159}} He attributed the former to delays in recognising that the bombers were headed for ''Tirpitz'', as well as inefficient chains of communication that slowed the speed with which this information could be acted on. For instance, it was not possible for German naval personnel to pass information directly to their [[Luftwaffe]] equivalents, as messages had to be sent through single-service channels and could only be transmitted between services at relatively senior levels.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=160}} The historian Daniel Knowles reached a similar conclusion, labelling ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s defences \"chaotic\" due to the poor communications between the battleship and Bardufoss.{{sfn|Knowles|2018|p=272}}\n\n===British===\n[[File:Willie Tait and an RAAF officer standing on the wreck of Tirpitz in 1945.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white photo of two men wearing military uniforms standing on the overturned hull of a ship|RAF Wing Commander Willie Tait (at left) and an Australian officer standing on the wreck of ''Tirpitz'' in late 1945]]\nThe British military undertook several analyses of the attack. In December 1944, No. 5 Group's headquarters investigated the accuracy of the bombing. This analysis found that No. 617 Squadron had been much more accurate than No. 9 Squadron, possibly due to the latter squadron's bombardiers inputting an inaccurate wind speed into their [[bombsight]]s. The superior [[Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sight]] fitted to No. 617 Squadron's aircraft may have also contributed to the difference.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nOn 21\u201322 May 1945, after [[End of World War II in Europe|the end of the war in Europe]], an RAF team travelled to Norway to investigate the causes of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s sinking. During the trip they inspected the wreck of the battleship and interviewed key German officers. In their report, the team noted that the damage inflicted on ''Tirpitz'' during Operations Source and Paravane had never been fully repaired. The team concluded that the battleship had been directly hit by two Tallboys.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=165\u2013167}} A team from the Royal Navy's [[Director of Naval Construction|Directorate of Naval Construction]] also inspected the wreck between 4 September and 14 October 1945, and interviewed witnesses to the attack. This team judged that a lack of watertight integrity resulting from flaws in ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s design as well as the watertight doors that divided [[Compartment (ship)|compartments]] being left open as the crew evacuated led the battleship to rapidly capsize.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=167\u2013168}} Sweetman noted that \"there was, thus, no single cause of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s ultimate loss\", as it resulted from the combination of two direct hits, the damage caused by five near misses and problems with the battleship's design.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=168}}\n\n===Historiography===\n[[File:Troms\u00f6, Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945 CL2830.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black and white photograph of a capsized ship|The wreck of ''Tirpitz'' after the war]]\nHistorians hold differing views over whether the final attacks on ''Tirpitz'' were necessary. [[Angus Konstam]] has written that the battleship posed no threat to Allied shipping from April 1944 due to the damage inflicted in Operations Source and Tungsten. He argued that the subsequent attacks were motivated by Churchill and other members of the War Cabinet having an \"obsession\" with destroying ''Tirpitz'', and that Operations Obviate and Catechism were mainly undertaken for propaganda purposes.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|pp=88\u201389}} Patrick Bishop has observed that \"the zeal of the pursuit, whipped on by Churchill, seems excessive now, but wartime created its own dynamic\", and that Operation Catechism contributed little towards ending the war.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=370}} Similarly, Niklas Zetterling and Michael Tamelander have judged that although \"the British were not fully aware that the Germans had written off ''Tirpitz'' as an offensive weapon in autumn 1944, their final efforts appear almost overzealous\".{{sfn|Zetterling|Tamelander|2009|p=327}} The [[official history]] of British intelligence in World War II states that D\u00f6nitz's use of the battleship to tie down Allied resources was successful, and \"in her last days she briefly excelled\" in this role.{{sfn|Hinsley|1984|p=277}}\n\nOther historians believe that the attacks were justified. Sweetman has written that while the Allied intelligence services erred in believing that ''Tirpitz'' could be repaired and returned to service following Operation Paravane, the British leadership acted correctly on the information available to them by ordering further attacks.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=169}} John Ellis reached a similar conclusion, and also argued that Operations Obviate and Catechism were justified as they contributed to sustaining the [[Operation Fortitude#Fortitude North|Fortitude North]] deception campaign that had led the Germans to maintain powerful ground forces in Norway in the mistaken belief that the Allies were planning amphibious landings there.{{sfn|Ellis|1999|pp=299\u2013300}} The retired [[United States Navy]] Rear Admiral [[William H. Langenberg]] judged that \"because of her strategic importance, all the Allied attempts to disable or sink ''Tirpitz'' were justified\".{{sfn|Langenberg|1981|p=91}}\n\nThere is consensus that the engagement was well executed by the Allied forces while the German forces failed. Konstam noted that Operations Paravane, Obviate and Catechism were \"well-planned and conducted\" and \"provided a neat ending to what had been a long and often tortuous aerial campaign\".{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=89}} Sweetman wrote that while the Royal Navy's aircraft and bombs could have destroyed ''Tirpitz'' \"with luck\", the combination of the highly-capable Lancaster bomber and the powerful Tallboy bomb was better suited to this task as it removed \"any element of luck, provided accuracy could be obtained\".{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=162\u2013163}} Bishop stated that while ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s crew \"did their duty and defended their ship to the last\", the Luftwaffe failed.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=367}} Jan Forsgren observed that the lack of attention given to the battleship's defence by the German high command was \"quite remarkable\" in light of the previous British attacks.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=144}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nNos. 9 and 617 Squadrons have had a long-running rivalry over which unit deserves credit for destroying ''Tirpitz''. This rivalry began immediately after Operation Catechism.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=155}} In 1950 the Norwegian Government presented the RAF with part of a [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] removed from the wreck which ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s crew had painted with a representation of the battleship. This was initially displayed at [[RAF Binbrook]], from which both Nos. 9 and 617 Squadrons had operated during periods of World War II, but was soon stolen by No. 9 Squadron personnel who installed it at the unit's headquarters. Over the next 50 years the squadrons conducted elaborate operations to steal the trophy from one another. It was handed over to the [[Royal Air Force Museum]] in 2002, and is currently on display at [[Royal Air Force Museum London]].{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\n''Tirpitz'' is commemorated by several monuments. The main memorial is a small granite slab in memory of the ship and the sailors killed on board her, at the Ehrenfriedhof cemetery in [[Wilhelmshaven]], Germany.

It was conducted on 12 November 1944 by 29 [[Royal Air Force]] [[heavy bomber]]s that attacked the battleship at its anchorage near the Norwegian city of [[Troms\u00f8 (city)|Troms\u00f8]]. The ship [[capsized]] after being hit by at least two bombs and damaged by the explosions of others, killing between 940 and 1,204 members of the crew; the British suffered no casualties.\n\nThe attack ended a long-running series of air and naval operations against ''Tirpitz'' that sought to eliminate the threat she posed to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] shipping. The battleship had been moved to the Troms\u00f8 area in October 1944 after being crippled on 15 September during [[Operation Paravane]]. This attack had been carried out by the RAF's elite [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|Nos. 9]] and [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|617 Squadrons]], who unsuccessfully attempted to strike ''Tirpitz'' again at Troms\u00f8 on 29 October during [[Operation Obviate]].\n\nOperation Catechism re-used the plans for Operation Obviate, and was conducted by the same squadrons. The aircraft departed from bases in northern Scotland and, due to clear weather conditions, the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] airmen were able to accurately target and bomb the battleship. The bombers were unmolested by [[Jagdgeschwader 5|a unit]] of German [[fighter aircraft]] that failed to take off from nearby Troms\u00f8 in time. One bomber was significantly damaged by anti-aircraft artillery.\n\n''Tirpitz'' capsized within minutes of being hit. Rescuers picked up hundreds of her crew from the water, but few of those trapped within the hull were saved. Several German military personnel were convicted of dereliction of duty following the attack. The battleship's destruction was celebrated in Allied countries and Norway, and is commemorated by several memorials and displays in museums.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz}}\nFrom early 1942, ''Tirpitz'' posed a significant threat to the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Allied convoys]] transporting supplies through the [[Norwegian Sea]] to the [[Soviet Union]]. Stationed in [[fjord]]s on the Norwegian coast, the [[battleship]] was capable of overwhelming the close-escort forces assigned to the Arctic convoys or breaking out into the North Atlantic.{{sfn|Ellis|1999|pp=294\u2013295}} To counter this threat, the Allies needed to keep a powerful force of warships with the British [[Home Fleet]], and [[capital ship]]s accompanied most convoys part of the way to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Bennett|2012|p=9}}{{sfn|Faulkner|Wilkinson|2012|p=109}}\n{{Location map+ | Norway North |relief=1 |width=300\n|float = left\n|caption = Northern Norway and nearby areas of Sweden, Finland and the Soviet Union\n|alt = Map of northern Norway and nearby areas marked with locations mentioned in the article\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Norway North\n    | label = [[Troms\u00f8 (city)|Troms\u00f8]]\n    | lat_deg = 69.68277778\n    | lon_deg = 18.94277778 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Norway North\n    | label = [[K\u00e5fjorden (Alta)|Kaafjord]]\n    | lat_deg = 69.9353\n    | lon_deg = 23.0454 }}\n {{Location map~ | Norway North\n    | label = [[Tornetr\u00e4sk]]\n    | lat_deg = 68.36666667\n    | lon_deg = 19.1 }}\n{{Location map~ | Norway North\n    | label = [[Bardufoss]]\n    | lat_deg = 69.0645\n    | lon_deg = 18.5152}}\n}}\n\n''Tirpitz'' was repeatedly attacked by British forces over several years. [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[heavy bomber]]s made four unsuccessful raids on the battleship between January and April 1942 while she was stationed at [[F\u00e6ttenfjord]].{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=6}} From March 1943, ''Tirpitz'' was based at [[K\u00e5fjorden (Alta)|Kaafjord]] in the far north of Norway. During [[Operation Source]] on 22 September, she was severely damaged by explosives placed on her hull by [[Royal Navy]] personnel who had used [[midget submarine]]s to penetrate Kaafjord.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=6}}{{sfn|Bennett|2012|pp=13\u201314}} On 3 April 1944, aircraft flying from Royal Navy [[aircraft carrier]]s attacked ''Tirpitz'' during [[Operation Tungsten]] and inflicted further damage.{{sfn|Bennett|2012|p=15}} A series of subsequent aircraft carrier attacks were unsuccessful, including [[Operation Mascot]] on 17 July and [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Operation Goodwood]] which was conducted between 22 and 29 August 1944.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=7}}{{sfn|Bennett|2012|p=19}}\n\nAfter the failure of Operation Goodwood, it was decided that further carrier attacks against ''Tirpitz'' would be fruitless due to the inadequacies of the Royal Navy's aircraft and their armament. Accordingly, responsibility for sinking ''Tirpitz'' was transferred to the RAF's [[Bomber Command RAF|Bomber Command]].{{sfn|Roskill|1961|p=161}}{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=85, 89}} On 15 September 1944, the elite [[No. 9 Squadron RAF|Nos. 9]] and [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|617 Squadrons]] attacked the battleship at Kaafjord during what was designated [[Operation Paravane]]. This operation employed [[Avro Lancaster]] heavy bombers armed with [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy]] heavy bombs and \"Johnnie Walker\" [[Naval mine|mines]].{{sfn|Bennett|2012|p=19}} The Tallboy bomb weighed {{convert|12000|lb|kg}} and had been developed to destroy heavily [[Vehicle armour|armoured]] targets. When dropped from a high altitude, the bomb could penetrate a battleship's deck armour before exploding within the vessel.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=16}} ''Tirpitz'' was struck by a single Tallboy during the attack that caused extensive damage to her [[Bow (ship)|bow]] and rendered her unfit for combat.{{sfn|Bennett|2012|p=19}}\n\nAs ''Tirpitz'' could not be repaired and Soviet forces were advancing towards Kaafjord, [[Grand Admiral]] [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], the commander of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (the German Navy), ordered that she be transferred to near the northern Norwegian city of [[Troms\u00f8 (city)|Troms\u00f8]] and used as an immobile battery to defend the area from attack. D\u00f6nitz hoped that this would also convince the Allies that ''Tirpitz'' continued to pose a threat.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=121}}{{sfn|Bishop|2012|pp=340\u2013341}} An anchorage was selected just off the coast of the island of [[H\u00e5k\u00f8ya]] where it was believed the water was shallow enough to prevent the battleship from sinking if another attack was successful.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=341}}{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=77}} ''Tirpitz'' arrived there on 16 October.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=123}} The depth of water at the mooring was found to be greater than anticipated, leaving the battleship vulnerable to capsizing. Because of the space needed by ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s [[torpedo net]]s, it was not possible to move her closer to shore.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=125}}\n\nRAF and Royal Navy reconnaissance aircraft located ''Tirpitz'' at Troms\u00f8 on 18 October.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=77}} As the Allied intelligence services had not been able to confirm that the battleship had been crippled, it was considered necessary to conduct further air raids against her.{{sfn|Zetterling|Tamelander|2009|pp=296\u2013297}} Nos. 9 and 617 Squadrons attacked ''Tirpitz'' on 29 October in what was designated [[Operation Obviate]]. As the Troms\u00f8 area was within range of RAF bases in northern Scotland if the Lancasters were modified, this attack was somewhat simpler to conduct than Operation Paravane. To extend their range, the Lancasters were fitted with extra fuel tanks and more powerful engines, and their forward and mid-upper gun turrets and pilot's armour plate were removed.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=126\u2013127}} The reduction in armament left the Lancasters very vulnerable to German [[fighter aircraft]], and they would have to fly without escort as no British fighters had the range needed to reach Troms\u00f8.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=113}}\n\nDuring Operation Obviate, the bombers flew north over the Norwegian Sea, and met up over [[Tornetr\u00e4sk]] lake in Northern Sweden.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=81}} This violated [[Sweden during World War II|Sweden's neutrality]], but allowed the bombers to approach Troms\u00f8 from the south-east. The Allies believed the Germans would not expect an attack from this direction.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=126}} Despite clear weather for most of the flight, ''Tirpitz'' was covered by cloud shortly before the Lancasters reached the point where they were to release their Tallboy bombs. This made it impossible to accurately target the battleship, and the 33 aircraft which bombed achieved no hits. ''Tirpitz'' was slightly damaged by a near miss. One of the Lancasters made a [[forced landing]] in Sweden after being damaged by anti-aircraft gunfire, and the remainder returned to base.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|pp=80\u201382}}{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=132\u2013134}}\n\n==Preparations==\n===British===\nBomber Command remained determined to sink ''Tirpitz'' as soon as possible, and preparations for another attack began shortly after Operation Obviate.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=132}}{{sfn|Roskill|1961|p=168}} A report issued by the Royal Navy's [[Naval Intelligence Division (United Kingdom)|Naval Intelligence Division]] on 3 November judged that it remained necessary to attack ''Tirpitz'' in northern Norway. The report argued that the battleship could potentially be repaired and made fully operational if she was left unmolested and able to reach a major port. As it would be difficult to target the battleship during the period of [[Polar night|near perpetual darkness]] in the northern winter, further attacks needed to be made within the 23 days before this commenced.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=137}} [[No. 5 Group RAF]] directed on 3 November that the next attack on ''Tirpitz'' was to take place on 5 November, and would re-use the plans developed for Operation Obviate. The raid was designated Operation Catechism.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=137}}\n\nTwo [[de Havilland Mosquito]] meteorological aircraft were stationed at [[RAF Sumburgh]] from 4 November, from where they conducted daily sorties to monitor weather conditions in the Troms\u00f8 area.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=137}}{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=123}} On the same day, twenty No. 9 Squadron and nineteen No. 617 Squadron Lancasters were dispatched to airfields in northern Scotland in preparation for the operation. A [[gale warning]] was issued that night and the raid was cancelled as a result on the morning of 5 November. Both squadrons returned to their home bases during the day.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=137}} The two squadrons deployed again to Scotland on 7 November, but soon returned to their home bases when the attack was cancelled.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=138}}\n\nOn 10 November, the Lancaster crews were briefed for another attack on ''Tirpitz''. Both squadrons moved to northern Scotland on 11 November when meteorological reports indicated that there would be clear weather over Troms\u00f8 for up to two days.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=138}}{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=82}} The aircraft were split between [[RAF Kinloss]], [[RAF Lossiemouth]] and [[RAF Milltown]].{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=138}}\n\n===German===\n[[File:Tirpitz at Tromso fjord in November 1944.JPG|thumb|''Tirpitz'' at her mooring off the island of [[H\u00e5k\u00f8ya]] in northern Norway in November 1944|alt=Black and white aerial photograph showing a body of water with a large warship near the shore]]\n''Tirpitz''{{'}}s defences were improved after Operation Obviate. Additional anti-aircraft guns were emplaced in the Troms\u00f8 area and torpedo nets were laid around the battleship.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=82}} These augmented the protection offered by the anti-aircraft ships [[HNoMS Tordenskjold|''Nymphe'']] and [[HNoMS Harald Haarfagre|''Thetis'']] and several anti-aircraft batteries on the shore.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=79}} [[Dredging]] operations to reduce the water level below the battleship's hull began on 1 November. By 12 November these were half complete.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=137}} The smoke generators that had previously protected ''Tirpitz'' at Kaafjord were still being installed at the time of Operation Catechism and were not yet operational. In their place, seven fishing boats fitted with smoke generators were positioned near the battleship; these were not capable of generating a smokescreen that could completely cover ''Tirpitz''.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=126}}\n\nThe battleship's crew continued regular training exercises, and remained concerned about further air attacks.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=124}} On 4 November ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s commanding officer Captain [[Wolf Junge]] departed. He was replaced by the executive officer, Captain Robert Weber.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=350}} Weber believed that within three weeks the days would be short enough to prevent further air attacks.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=82}} On 12 November around 1,700 men were on board ''Tirpitz''.{{sfn|Knowles|2018|p=270}}\n\nA force of 38 fighters was transferred to [[Bardufoss]] after Operation Obviate to bolster the Troms\u00f8 region's air defences.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=122}} These aircraft formed part of [[Jagdgeschwader 5]] (JG 5), and were under the temporary command of Major [[Heinrich Ehrler]]. The unit had been evacuated from [[Kirkenes]] in the far northeastern region of Norway as Soviet forces [[Petsamo\u2013Kirkenes Offensive|advanced towards the town]], and was disorganised at the time of Operation Catechism.{{sfn|Zetterling|Tamelander|2009|p=307}} Most of the pilots at Bardufoss were inexperienced and ill-trained, and the unit had not been properly briefed on ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s presence in the area. Ehrler arrived at Bardufoss on 9 November en route to [[Alta (town)|Alta]], and decided to remain there until the morning of 12 November to oversee an emergency training programme for the fighter pilots.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=126}}\n\n==Attack==\n===Departure===\n\nThe decision to launch Operation Catechism was made in the early hours of 12 November. A [[Weather forecasting|weather forecast]] issued on the afternoon of 11 November predicted that clouds might be encountered over northern Norway. One of the Mosquito meteorological aircraft flew over the area that evening, and its crew reported encountering patches of cloud when they returned to Scotland shortly after midnight on the night of 11\u201312 November.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=138}} Nevertheless, the commander of No. 5 Group, Air Commodore [[Ralph Cochrane]], decided to attempt another attack in the hope that the bombers would encounter clear weather over Troms\u00f8. The plan for this operation remained the same as that used in Operation Obviate, with the attack force to use identical routes.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=352}}\n\nA total of 32 Lancasters were dispatched. No. 617 Squadron contributed eighteen bombers, and No. 9 Squadron thirteen. As with Operations Paravane and Obviate, they were joined by a Lancaster fitted out as a film aircraft from [[No. 463 Squadron RAAF]].{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=83}} The role of this aircraft was to collect material for use in [[propaganda]] films.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=89}} Seven No. 9 Squadron Lancasters, including that of its commanding officer Wing Commander [[James Bazin]], were unable to participate, as they could not be cleared in time of the snow and ice that had formed on them overnight.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=352}}{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=125}} The No. 617 Squadron aircraft took off between 2:59 and 3:25&nbsp;am [[British Summer Time|BST]], and the No. 9 Squadron aircraft between 3:00 and 3:35&nbsp;am BST.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=139}} The aircraft flown by No. 9 Squadron's deputy commander, Squadron Leader Bill Williams, was among those able to take off and he assumed command of the unit.{{sfn|Zetterling|Tamelander|2009|p=305}}{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=364}}\n\nThe Lancasters flew individually over the Norwegian Sea. As had been the case during Operation Obviate, they crossed the Norwegian coast between the towns of [[Mosj\u00f8en]] and [[Namsos (town)|Namsos]] where a gap in German radar coverage had been located. Several of the bombers flew too far to the north, and came within range of German radar stations.{{sfn|Zetterling|Tamelander|2009|pp=298, 305}} The attack force rendezvoused over Tornetr\u00e4sk lake.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=352}}{{sfn|Zetterling|Tamelander|2009|p=305}} After making two orbits, No. 617 Squadron's commanding officer, Wing Commander [[James Brian Tait|\"Willie\" Tait]], fired a [[flare gun]] from his aircraft to signal the force to proceed to Troms\u00f8.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=139}} Two No. 9 Squadron Lancasters failed to reach Tornetr\u00e4sk lake in time, and returned to base without attacking.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=352}}{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=83}}\n\n===Approach===\n\nThe attack force proceeded north-west towards Troms\u00f8, and climbed to {{convert|14000|ft|m}} to clear the mountains along the border of Sweden and Norway. They were guided by radio homing signals transmitted by a Norwegian [[Milorg]] agent stationed near the border between the two countries.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|pp=127\u2013128}} By the time they reached the Troms\u00f8 area, both of the squadrons had formed up into loose formations.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=354}} No. 617 Squadron led the attack, followed by No. 9 Squadron.

Between 7:39&nbsp;am and 8:50&nbsp;am BST several observation posts in the area reported sighting Lancasters. As the first aircraft to be spotted were flying east, it was thought that they might be headed to the Soviet Union. ''Tirpitz'' was not notified of the reports until 8:15&nbsp;am BST and few reports were passed on to the JG 5 detachment at Bardufoss. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s air raid siren was sounded at 8:51&nbsp;am, and Weber informed the ship's crew seven minutes later that an attack was possible.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=128}}\n\nAt around 9:15&nbsp;am BST, ''Tirpitz'' contacted Bardufoss to request that fighters be dispatched to provide air cover. This was too late for any of the fighters to reach Troms\u00f8 before the bombers arrived.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=129}} The local Luftwaffe command ordered the fighters to be [[Scrambling (military)|scrambled]] at 9:18&nbsp;am. Due to various delays, the aircraft did not begin taking off from Bardufoss until approximately 9:32&nbsp;am. Ehrler took off first, but the others were delayed from doing so for several minutes while an aircraft landed on the runway. Ehrler proceeded to the Troms\u00f8 area by himself, but was unable to locate the British bombers before they attacked. It is not clear where the other fighters were sent. One post-attack report stated they were sent to the border with Sweden, another that they proceeded to Kaafjord and two pilots claimed to have reached Troms\u00f8 after ''Tirpitz'' was destroyed.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=157\u2013159}}\n\nWeather conditions over Troms\u00f8 continued to be clear when the attack force arrived in the area. Tait spotted ''Tirpitz'' from {{convert|20|mi|km}} away, and later recalled that she was \"lying squat and black among her torpedo nets like a spider in her web, silhouetted against the glittering blue and green waters of the fjord\".{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=352}}\n\n===Destruction of ''Tirpitz''===\n''Tirpitz'' fired the first shots of the battle at 9:38&nbsp;am BST when she opened fire on the bombers with her {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}} calibre main guns from a range of {{convert|13.5|mi|km|0}}, firing timed-fuze fragmentation shells designed for barrage antiaircraft fire. Other anti-aircraft guns also fired on the Lancasters as they approached, but did not disrupt them.

Tait's aircraft was the first to drop its Tallboy, which hit ''Tirpitz''. No. 617 Squadron completed its attack at 9:44&nbsp;am BST with all aircraft bombing. No. 9 Squadron aircraft began dropping their Tallboys at 9:45&nbsp;am BST. By this time the battleship was on fire and covered in smoke.

The historian John Sweetman states that this bomb ricocheted off the side of the ship. William H. Garzke and Robert O.

Despite the list, Weber expected that ''Tirpitz'' would not sink as the water beneath her hull was too shallow.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=85}} Counter flooding proved impossible as the controls for the necessary systems had been abandoned, and the volume of water that was entering the ship was well beyond their ability to fight had they been operational. Weber ordered that the lower decks be evacuated at 9:45&nbsp;am, by which time the list had reached between 30 and 40 degrees.{{sfn|Garzke|Dulin|1985|pp=273\u2013274}} At 9:50&nbsp;am the magazine for \"Caesar\" turret exploded, causing extensive damage. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s list rapidly increased, and she was soon lying on her side. Weber then gave the order to abandon ship.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=85}} The battleship continued to heel over, and capsized at 9:52&nbsp;am.{{sfn|Brown|1977|p=43}} Almost 1,000 of her crew had either been killed by this time, or were trapped inside the hull.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=85}}\n\nThe crews of several Lancasters observed ''Tirpitz'' capsize.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=140}} The No. 463 Squadron film aircraft made a final pass over the battleship at an altitude of just {{convert|50|ft|m}} to capture footage of the event.{{sfn|Nichol|2015|p=263}} Just after 11:00&nbsp;am BST a photo reconnaissance Mosquito overflew the Troms\u00f8 region, and photographed the wreck.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=146}} The [[Secret Intelligence Service]] agent [[Egil Lindberg]] also sent radio reports from Troms\u00f8 confirming that ''Tirpitz'' had been destroyed.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=144}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Rescue efforts===\n[[File:Battlehip Tirpitz capsized at Tromso c1944.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white aerial photograph showing an overturned ship|''Tirpitz'' following Operation Catechism]]\nThe German forces in the Troms\u00f8 area endeavoured to rescue the surviving members of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s crew.

Local Norwegian civilians who owned torches hid them, and only one could be found.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=137}} A total of 87 men were rescued from within the hull in the 24 hours after the attack.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=362}} Cutting continued for two further days, and was finally abandoned when it was assessed that the oxygen supply inside the wreck would have been exhausted; no survivors were recovered during this period.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=362}}{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=137}} Estimates of the total number of sailors and officers killed vary, with the most common figures lying between 940 and 1,204.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=137}} Weber and all of his senior officers were among the dead.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=362}}{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=152}}\n\nMany Norwegian civilians in Troms\u00f8 were pleased that ''Tirpitz'' had been destroyed, not least as it meant the end of an order requiring that they [[billet]] members of her crew. Several civilians who showed pleasure at the event in public were arrested by the [[Gestapo]].{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=145}} Other Norwegians were saddened by the way that the battleship's crew had died.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=141}}\n\nWork began on stripping ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s wreck soon after rescue efforts ended, and continued until the late 1950s. Before the end of the war, German personnel removed the ship's bronze [[propeller]]s and some other components so they could be melted down.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=149}} The wreck was sold to a Norwegian [[scrap]] dealing company in 1948, and was broken up [[in situ]]. Salvage work concluded in 1957, by which time most remnants of the battleship had been removed. The human remains which were recovered from the wreck by scrappers were initially buried alongside unwanted parts of ''Tirpitz'', but this ceased following complaints by a local church minister. The remains of hundreds of others were recovered and buried in Norwegian cemeteries.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=154}}\n\n===Return to base===\nOne of the No. 9 Squadron Lancasters was badly damaged by anti-aircraft gunfire, and its pilot decided to attempt a crash-landing in Sweden. The crew were able to make radio contact with [[Swedish Armed Forces|Swedish military]] forces manning a small airfield at [[Naisj\u00e4rv]], who prepared it for the bomber. When one of the Lancaster's engines cut out while attempting to land, the pilot made a [[belly landing]] in a field near a village. None of the crew were injured, and all were [[Internment|interned]] by the Swedish Government.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|pp=145\u2013147}} They were subsequently [[Repatriation|repatriated]] to the UK.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=144}}\n[[File:Royal Air Force 1939-1945- Bomber Command CH17863.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black and white photo of six men standing behind an aircraft|A No. 617 Squadron crew shortly after returning from Operation Catechism]]\n\nThe other Lancasters' return flights were complicated by adverse winds. Due to shortages of fuel, many had to divert to alternate airfields but all landed safely during the afternoon of 12 November.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=145}} The film aircraft flew directly to its home station, [[RAF Waddington]], where its pilot was debriefed by Air Commodore Cochrane.{{sfn|Nichol|2015|p=271}} The bomber squadrons returned to their home bases over the next two days.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=146}}\n\nIn the days after the attack, the airmen received congratulations from King [[George VI]], Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], the [[Churchill war ministry|War Cabinet]] and many others. They were also all granted a 48-hour period of leave.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=146}} Churchill was congratulated by his fellow Allied leaders [[Franklin D.

The two airmen also gave interviews; Tait described the raid in a [[BBC]] broadcast and Williams spoke with American [[CBS]] correspondent [[Edward R. Murrow]].{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=364}} The success of Operation Catechism led to celebrations in Allied countries. ''Tirpitz'' was seen as a symbol of the [[Nazi]] regime, and her destruction provided further evidence that the war was coming to an end. Tait was privately sceptical of the value of the operation though, and later noted in his private papers that it \"had not contributed much to the Allied victory\" as the crippled battleship had not posed a threat.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=370}}\n\nMany of the aircrew involved in Operation Catechism were decorated in recognition of their part in the attack.{{sfn|Nichol|2015|p=273}} Cochrane recommended Tait for the [[Victoria Cross]]. While the recommendation was endorsed by Air Chief Marshal [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Sir Arthur Harris]], the head of Bomber Command, the medal was not awarded.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=371}} Instead, Tait was awarded a third [[Medal bar|bar]] to his [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO).

More than half the Home Fleet was deployed elsewhere, including many ships sent to the Pacific to fight Japanese forces.{{sfn|Knowles|2018|p=281}}\n\n==Assessments==\n===German===\nThe loss of ''Tirpitz'' was a disaster for the German military units in northern Norway.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=141}} In addition to the heavy loss of life, the destruction of the battleship left the ''Kriegsmarine'' without any of the capital ships needed to threaten Allied convoy routes.{{sfn|Ellis|Warhurst|1968|p=129}} Ehrler and several personnel assigned to observer posts, anti-aircraft guns and ships were [[court martialled]] and imprisoned.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=160}} Ehrler was convicted in relation to leaving his unit's operations room under the command of a [[non-commissioned officer]] on 12 November. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, but was released after a month and demoted. He was killed in combat on 4 April 1945.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=156\u2013157}} Many commentators and members of JG 5 believe that Ehrler was treated as a [[scapegoat]].{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=156}} D\u00f6nitz also ordered that an inquiry be held into why the battleship capsized. The inquiry concluded that \"the actual depth of the prepared berth did not conform with the requirements and directions of the commander-in-chief\".{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=164\u2013165}}\n\nIt is unclear why the fighters at Bardufoss failed to protect the battleship. Much of the relevant documentation did not survive the war, and accounts from survivors are at times contradictory.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=157}} Sweetman judged that the failure ultimately resulted from the order to intercept the bombers being issued too late, and a lack of clear plans to coordinate the defence.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=159}} He attributed the former to delays in recognising that the bombers were headed for ''Tirpitz'', as well as inefficient chains of communication that slowed the speed with which this information could be acted on. For instance, it was not possible for German naval personnel to pass information directly to their [[Luftwaffe]] equivalents, as messages had to be sent through single-service channels and could only be transmitted between services at relatively senior levels.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=160}} The historian Daniel Knowles reached a similar conclusion, labelling ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s defences \"chaotic\" due to the poor communications between the battleship and Bardufoss.{{sfn|Knowles|2018|p=272}}\n\n===British===\n[[File:Willie Tait and an RAAF officer standing on the wreck of Tirpitz in 1945.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white photo of two men wearing military uniforms standing on the overturned hull of a ship|RAF Wing Commander Willie Tait (at left) and an Australian officer standing on the wreck of ''Tirpitz'' in late 1945]]\nThe British military undertook several analyses of the attack. In December 1944, No. 5 Group's headquarters investigated the accuracy of the bombing. This analysis found that No. 617 Squadron had been much more accurate than No. 9 Squadron, possibly due to the latter squadron's bombardiers inputting an inaccurate wind speed into their [[bombsight]]s. The superior [[Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sight]] fitted to No. 617 Squadron's aircraft may have also contributed to the difference.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nOn 21\u201322 May 1945, after [[End of World War II in Europe|the end of the war in Europe]], an RAF team travelled to Norway to investigate the causes of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s sinking. During the trip they inspected the wreck of the battleship and interviewed key German officers. In their report, the team noted that the damage inflicted on ''Tirpitz'' during Operations Source and Paravane had never been fully repaired. The team concluded that the battleship had been directly hit by two Tallboys.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=165\u2013167}} A team from the Royal Navy's [[Director of Naval Construction|Directorate of Naval Construction]] also inspected the wreck between 4 September and 14 October 1945, and interviewed witnesses to the attack. This team judged that a lack of watertight integrity resulting from flaws in ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s design as well as the watertight doors that divided [[Compartment (ship)|compartments]] being left open as the crew evacuated led the battleship to rapidly capsize.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=167\u2013168}} Sweetman noted that \"there was, thus, no single cause of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s ultimate loss\", as it resulted from the combination of two direct hits, the damage caused by five near misses and problems with the battleship's design.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=168}}\n\n===Historiography===\n[[File:Troms\u00f6, Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945 CL2830.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black and white photograph of a capsized ship|The wreck of ''Tirpitz'' after the war]]\nHistorians hold differing views over whether the final attacks on ''Tirpitz'' were necessary. [[Angus Konstam]] has written that the battleship posed no threat to Allied shipping from April 1944 due to the damage inflicted in Operations Source and Tungsten. He argued that the subsequent attacks were motivated by Churchill and other members of the War Cabinet having an \"obsession\" with destroying ''Tirpitz'', and that Operations Obviate and Catechism were mainly undertaken for propaganda purposes.{{sfn|Konstam|2018|pp=88\u201389}} Patrick Bishop has observed that \"the zeal of the pursuit, whipped on by Churchill, seems excessive now, but wartime created its own dynamic\", and that Operation Catechism contributed little towards ending the war.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=370}} Similarly, Niklas Zetterling and Michael Tamelander have judged that although \"the British were not fully aware that the Germans had written off ''Tirpitz'' as an offensive weapon in autumn 1944, their final efforts appear almost overzealous\".{{sfn|Zetterling|Tamelander|2009|p=327}} The [[official history]] of British intelligence in World War II states that D\u00f6nitz's use of the battleship to tie down Allied resources was successful, and \"in her last days she briefly excelled\" in this role.{{sfn|Hinsley|1984|p=277}}\n\nOther historians believe that the attacks were justified. Sweetman has written that while the Allied intelligence services erred in believing that ''Tirpitz'' could be repaired and returned to service following Operation Paravane, the British leadership acted correctly on the information available to them by ordering further attacks.{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|p=169}} John Ellis reached a similar conclusion, and also argued that Operations Obviate and Catechism were justified as they contributed to sustaining the [[Operation Fortitude#Fortitude North|Fortitude North]] deception campaign that had led the Germans to maintain powerful ground forces in Norway in the mistaken belief that the Allies were planning amphibious landings there.{{sfn|Ellis|1999|pp=299\u2013300}} The retired [[United States Navy]] Rear Admiral [[William H. Langenberg]] judged that \"because of her strategic importance, all the Allied attempts to disable or sink ''Tirpitz'' were justified\".{{sfn|Langenberg|1981|p=91}}\n\nThere is consensus that the engagement was well executed by the Allied forces while the German forces failed. Konstam noted that Operations Paravane, Obviate and Catechism were \"well-planned and conducted\" and \"provided a neat ending to what had been a long and often tortuous aerial campaign\".{{sfn|Konstam|2018|p=89}} Sweetman wrote that while the Royal Navy's aircraft and bombs could have destroyed ''Tirpitz'' \"with luck\", the combination of the highly-capable Lancaster bomber and the powerful Tallboy bomb was better suited to this task as it removed \"any element of luck, provided accuracy could be obtained\".{{sfn|Sweetman|2000|pp=162\u2013163}} Bishop stated that while ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s crew \"did their duty and defended their ship to the last\", the Luftwaffe failed.{{sfn|Bishop|2012|p=367}} Jan Forsgren observed that the lack of attention given to the battleship's defence by the German high command was \"quite remarkable\" in light of the previous British attacks.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=144}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nNos. 9 and 617 Squadrons have had a long-running rivalry over which unit deserves credit for destroying ''Tirpitz''. This rivalry began immediately after Operation Catechism.{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|p=155}} In 1950 the Norwegian Government presented the RAF with part of a [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] removed from the wreck which ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s crew had painted with a representation of the battleship. This was initially displayed at [[RAF Binbrook]], from which both Nos. 9 and 617 Squadrons had operated during periods of World War II, but was soon stolen by No. 9 Squadron personnel who installed it at the unit's headquarters. Over the next 50 years the squadrons conducted elaborate operations to steal the trophy from one another. It was handed over to the [[Royal Air Force Museum]] in 2002, and is currently on display at [[Royal Air Force Museum London]].{{sfn|Forsgren|2014|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\n''Tirpitz'' is commemorated by several monuments.
