The initial code release included builds for Windows and macOS, and a build for Linux, at a very early stage of development and lacking complete functionality.

Chromium users have filed many bug reports and feature requests asking for a master password option to access stored passwords, but Chromium developers have consistently insisted that this provides no real security against knowledgeable hackers. Users have argued that it would protect against co-workers or family members borrowing a computer and seeing the stored passwords in clear text. In December 2009, Chromium developer P. Kasting stated: \"A master password was issue 1397. That issue is closed. We will not implement a master password. Not now, not ever. Arguing for it won't make it happen.

Development work in this version centered on cleaning up the ''settings'' menu, including the Sync menu and eliminating all checkboxes. Reviewer Wolfgang Gruener said \"The Settings menu isn't quite as messy anymore and looks much more like what you would expect from a professionally designed software.\" Language and spell checking support was expanded to 100 languages. Chromium 11 used WebKit 534.18 and V8 3.1.1 which resulted in improved speed in JavaScript and other benchmark tests. In early testing Chromium 11 was faster than [[Firefox 4]] in V8 and Kraken benchmarks, but was 12% slower than [[Internet Explorer 9]] in [[WebKit|Sunspider]] tests.<ref name=\"ChromiumReleases\" /><ref name=\"Gruener04Feb11\" />\n\nIn February 2011, Google's Jeff Chang announced to Chromium developers that Google was considering further large-scale interface changes. Under consideration were eliminating the \"Omnibox\" URL bar and combining the two-line layout which has tabs on one line and navigation buttons, a menu and URL bar on a second line into one single line, thus freeing up more screen space for content. (Such a layout was later adopted by [[Internet Explorer 9]].) Chang acknowledged that this would result in URLs not always being visible to the user, that navigation controls and menus may lose their context and that the resulting single line could be quite crowded. Other proposed changes include being able to log into multiple accounts in different windows and improved URL suggestions from the user's history.<ref name=\"Gruener20Feb11\">{{cite news|url= http://www.conceivablytech.com/5746/products/google-may-kill-chrome-url-bar|title= Google May Kill Chrome URL Bar|access-date= 6 February 2011|last= Gruener|first= Wolfgang|authorlink= |date=February 2011 |work= Conceivably Tech|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130326023943/http://www.conceivablytech.com/5746/products/google-may-kill-chrome-url-bar |archivedate= 26 March 2013}}</ref> By the middle of 2011, after some experimentation, the developers decided that eliminating the URL bar was too risky and shelved the idea.<ref name=\"Gruener09Aug11\">{{cite news|url= http://www.conceivablytech.com/8765/products/google-shelves-hidden-location-bar|title= Google Shelves Hidden Location Bar|access-date= 9 August 2011|last= Gruener|first= Wolfgang|authorlink= |date=August 2011 |work= Conceivably Tech|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120406211012/http://www.conceivablytech.com/8765/products/google-shelves-hidden-location-bar |archivedate= 6 April 2012}}</ref> Chromium 11 also introduced a new simplified 2D logo that replaced the 3D logo used from the project since its inception.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.techspot.com/news/42848-google-chrome-and-chromium-to-get-new-logos.html|title= Google Chrome and Chromium to get new logos|access-date=2017-12-10|last= Protalinski|first= Emil|authorlink= |date=2011-03-16 |work= Conceivably Tech}}</ref>\n\n[[Mageia]] first offered Chromium 11 in Mageia v1 during 2011.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mageia |url=https://www.mageia.org/en/1/notes/ |title=Mageia 1 Release Notes |publisher=Mageia.org |date=2011-01-18 |access-date=2013-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/19367930/dir/mandriva_2011/com/chromium-browser-stable-13.0.782.215-1-mdv2011.0.i586.rpm.html |title=RPM Mandriva 2011 chromium-browser-stable 13.0.782.215 i586 rpm |publisher=Rpm.pbone.net |date=2011-08-23 |access-date=2013-10-04}}</ref>\n\nChromium 12.0 was released on 11 March 2011, with 12.0.700.0 as the first version.

Chromium 12 incorporated WebKit 534.24 and V8 JavaScript engine version 3.2.1.1. It is anticipated that a URL bar web app launcher would be added during the development cycle. Early in the Chromium 12 cycle the ''history quick provider'' was introduced.

The size is a concern to developers, who have noted that Chrome 1 was 9.0 MB in Windows download size, compared to Chrome 10 for Windows at 26.2 MB, as a result they have created a \"bloat taskforce\". Larger download sizes are a problem for a number of reasons, as Chrome Developer Ian Fette explained: \"1. We do distribution deals with Chrome, where we bundle Chrome with other products. These get difficult when our binary grows. 2. We see increased download failures/ install dropoffs as the binary grows, especially in countries with poor bandwidth like India. India also happens to be a very good market for Chrome (we have good market share there and growing), so that's also very problematic.\"<ref name=\"Gruener22Mar11\">{{cite web|url= http://www.conceivablytech.com/6390/products/google-chrome-in-2011-the-biggest-loser |title= Google Chrome in 2011: The Biggest Loser?|access-date= 27 March 2011|last= Gruener|first= Wolfgang|authorlink= |date=March 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120818111245/http://www.conceivablytech.com/6390/products/google-chrome-in-2011-the-biggest-loser |archivedate= 18 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Shankland22Mar11\">{{cite web|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20045776-264.html|title= Google working to reverse Chrome bloat|access-date= 27 March 2011|last= Shankland|first= Stephen|authorlink= |date=March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWith the release of Chromium 12.0.742.0 on 19 April 2011 the interface incorporated many changes, the most significant since Chromium 6 was released.

Development work in this version centered on cleaning up the ''settings'' menu, including the Sync menu and eliminating all checkboxes. Reviewer Wolfgang Gruener said \"The Settings menu isn't quite as messy anymore and looks much more like what you would expect from a professionally designed software.\" Language and spell checking support was expanded to 100 languages. Chromium 11 used WebKit 534.18 and V8 3.1.1 which resulted in improved speed in JavaScript and other benchmark tests. In early testing Chromium 11 was faster than [[Firefox 4]] in V8 and Kraken benchmarks, but was 12% slower than [[Internet Explorer 9]] in [[WebKit|Sunspider]] tests.<ref name=\"ChromiumReleases\" /><ref name=\"Gruener04Feb11\" />\n\nIn February 2011, Google's Jeff Chang announced to Chromium developers that Google was considering further large-scale interface changes. Under consideration were eliminating the \"Omnibox\" URL bar and combining the two-line layout which has tabs on one line and navigation buttons, a menu and URL bar on a second line into one single line, thus freeing up more screen space for content. (Such a layout was later adopted by [[Internet Explorer 9]].) Chang acknowledged that this would result in URLs not always being visible to the user, that navigation controls and menus may lose their context and that the resulting single line could be quite crowded. Other proposed changes include being able to log into multiple accounts in different windows and improved URL suggestions from the user's history.<ref name=\"Gruener20Feb11\">{{cite news|url= http://www.conceivablytech.com/5746/products/google-may-kill-chrome-url-bar|title= Google May Kill Chrome URL Bar|access-date= 6 February 2011|last= Gruener|first= Wolfgang|authorlink= |date=February 2011 |work= Conceivably Tech|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130326023943/http://www.conceivablytech.com/5746/products/google-may-kill-chrome-url-bar |archivedate= 26 March 2013}}</ref> By the middle of 2011, after some experimentation, the developers decided that eliminating the URL bar was too risky and shelved the idea.<ref name=\"Gruener09Aug11\">{{cite news|url= http://www.conceivablytech.com/8765/products/google-shelves-hidden-location-bar|title= Google Shelves Hidden Location Bar|access-date= 9 August 2011|last= Gruener|first= Wolfgang|authorlink= |date=August 2011 |work= Conceivably Tech|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120406211012/http://www.conceivablytech.com/8765/products/google-shelves-hidden-location-bar |archivedate= 6 April 2012}}</ref> Chromium 11 also introduced a new simplified 2D logo that replaced the 3D logo used from the project since its inception.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.techspot.com/news/42848-google-chrome-and-chromium-to-get-new-logos.html|title= Google Chrome and Chromium to get new logos|access-date=2017-12-10|last= Protalinski|first= Emil|authorlink= |date=2011-03-16 |work= Conceivably Tech}}</ref>\n\n[[Mageia]] first offered Chromium 11 in Mageia v1 during 2011.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mageia |url=https://www.mageia.org/en/1/notes/ |title=Mageia 1 Release Notes |publisher=Mageia.org |date=2011-01-18 |access-date=2013-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/19367930/dir/mandriva_2011/com/chromium-browser-stable-13.0.782.215-1-mdv2011.0.i586.rpm.html |title=RPM Mandriva 2011 chromium-browser-stable 13.0.782.215 i586 rpm |publisher=Rpm.pbone.net |date=2011-08-23 |access-date=2013-10-04}}</ref>\n\nChromium 12.0 was released on 11 March 2011, with 12.0.700.0 as the first version. Initial changes in the first versions of Chromium 12 included <code>about:flags</code> updates of test features, incorporating an fps counter for hardware acceleration benchmarks, a P2P [[API]] that may indicate future platform data exchange features, an enhanced URL bar and small changes to the tabs. Chromium 12 incorporated WebKit 534.24 and V8 JavaScript engine version 3.2.1.1. It is anticipated that a URL bar web app launcher would be added during the development cycle. Early in the Chromium 12 cycle the ''history quick provider'' was introduced. This feature automatically searches the browser history for websites visited in the past 72 hours looking for matching page titles and URLs. It also searches through URLs that have been typed at least twice and URLs that have been visited at least four times ever.<ref name=\"ChromiumReleases\" /><ref name=\"Baily11Mar11\">{{cite news|url= http://www.conceivablytech.com/6152/products/google-upgrades-chrome-url-bar|title= Google Upgrades Chrome URL Bar|access-date= 15 March 2011|last= Bailey|first= Dan|authorlink= |date=March 2011 |work= Conceivably Tech|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120406211045/http://www.conceivablytech.com/6152/products/google-upgrades-chrome-url-bar |archivedate= 6 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2011 Google announced directions for the project for the year, including a plan for seven new major versions, planning to end the year with Chrome 17 out. Development priorities focus on reducing the browser's size, integrating web applications and plug-ins, cloud capabilities and touch interface. The size is a concern to developers, who have noted that Chrome 1 was 9.0 MB in Windows download size, compared to Chrome 10 for Windows at 26.2 MB, as a result they have created a \"bloat taskforce\". Larger download sizes are a problem for a number of reasons, as Chrome Developer Ian Fette explained: \"1. We do distribution deals with Chrome, where we bundle Chrome with other products. These get difficult when our binary grows. 2. We see increased download failures/ install dropoffs as the binary grows, especially in countries with poor bandwidth like India. India also happens to be a very good market for Chrome (we have good market share there and growing), so that's also very problematic.\"<ref name=\"Gruener22Mar11\">{{cite web|url= http://www.conceivablytech.com/6390/products/google-chrome-in-2011-the-biggest-loser |title= Google Chrome in 2011: The Biggest Loser?|access-date= 27 March 2011|last= Gruener|first= Wolfgang|authorlink= |date=March 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120818111245/http://www.conceivablytech.com/6390/products/google-chrome-in-2011-the-biggest-loser |archivedate= 18 August 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Shankland22Mar11\">{{cite web|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20045776-264.html|title= Google working to reverse Chrome bloat|access-date= 27 March 2011|last= Shankland|first= Stephen|authorlink= |date=March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWith the release of Chromium 12.0.742.0 on 19 April 2011 the interface incorporated many changes, the most significant since Chromium 6 was released. A multi-profile button was introduced allowing users to log into multiple Google and other accounts in the same browser instance. The new tab page was also redesigned and separated into four horizontally scrollable screens, providing access to ''most visited pages'', ''Google apps'', plus two identified pages. The page reload button was also redesigned along with minor changes to the URL bar. The first stable version of Chrome and Chromium 12 released was 12.0.742.91 which brought malware detection and support for hardware-accelerated 3D CSS transforms.<ref name=\"Gruener19Apr11\">{{cite news|url= http://www.conceivablytech.com/6908/products/google-preps-huge-ui-update-for-chrome|title= Google Preps Huge UI Update For Chrome|access-date= 20 April 2011|last= Gruener|first= Wolfgang|authorlink= |date=April 2011 |work= Conceivably Tech|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120406211102/http://www.conceivablytech.com/6908/products/google-preps-huge-ui-update-for-chrome |archivedate= 6 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Paul10Jun11\">{{cite news|url= https://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2011/06/chrome-12-arrives-with-security-rendering-improvements.ars|title= Chrome 12 arrives with security, rendering improvements|access-date= 12 June 2011|last= Paul|first= Ryan|authorlink= |date=June 2011 |work= [[Ars Technica]]}}</ref>\n\nChromium 13.0 was released on 26 April 2011, with 13.0.748.0 as the initial version.<ref name=\"ChromiumReleases\" /> Early versions of Chromium 13 included a menu button to enable users to switch between multiple Google profiles, multi-selection of tabs and an improved omnibox engine.
