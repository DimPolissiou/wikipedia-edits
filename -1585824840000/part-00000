It is thus a [[cognate]] of the words [[Slavonia]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slavs|Slavia]]. The etymology of {{wikt-lang|en|Slav}} itself remains uncertain.\n\nThe reconstructed autonym ''{{lang|sla|*Slov\u011bnin\u044a}}'' is usually derived from the word ''slovo'' (\"word\"), originally denoting \"people who speak (the same language),\" i.&nbsp;e. people who understand each other. This is in contrast to the Slavic word denoting German people, namely {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*n\u011bm\u044cc\u044c}}, meaning \"silent, mute people\" (from Slavic {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*n\u011bm\u044a}} \"[[muteness|mute]], mumbling\"). The word ''slovo'' (\"word\") and the related ''slava'' (\"glory, fame\") and ''slukh'' (\"hearing\") originate from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root {{wikt-lang|ine-pro|*\u1e31lew-}} (\"be spoken of, glory\"), cognate with Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{grc-tr|\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} \"fame\"), as in the name [[Pericles]], Latin {{wikt-lang|la|clueo}} (\"be called\"), and English {{wikt-lang|en|loud}}.\n\nThe modern Slovene state originates from the [[Slovene National Liberation Committee]] (SNOS) held on 19 February 1944. They officially named the state as ''Federal Slovenia'' ({{lang|sl|Federalna Slovenija}}), a unit within the Yugoslav federation. On 20 February 1946, Federal Slovenia was renamed the ''People's Republic of Slovenia'' (''Ljudska republika Slovenija'').<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-AFGPZB0W/? |title=Mesto kot upravnoteritorialna enota 1945\u20131955 |language=Slovenian, English |trans-title=A Town as an Administrative\u2013Territorial Unit |first=Janez |last=Kopa\u010d |year=2007 |volume=30 |issue=2 |publisher=Arhivsko dru\u0161tvo Slovenije |id={{COBISS|ID=914293}} |page=83 |journal=Arhivi |issn=0351-2835 |access-date=30 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831002448/http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-AFGPZB0W/ |archive-date=31 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It retained this name until 9 April 1963, when its name was changed again, this time to ''Socialist Republic of Slovenia'' ({{lang-sl|Socialisti\u010dna republika Slovenija}}).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:9842 |title=Ustava Socialisti\u010dne republike Slovenije z dne 9. aprila 1963 |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia from 9 April 1963 |first=Janez |last=Kopa\u010d |journal=Arhivi |year=2001 |volume=XXIV |issue=1 |page=1 |access-date=30 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232837/http://sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:9842 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On 8 March 1990, SR Slovenia removed the prefix \"Socialist\" from its name, becoming the ''Republic of Slovenia''; it remained a part of the SFRY until 25 June 1991.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:center; clear:right;\"\n|+Official names\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1945\u20131946 || '''[[Slovene National Liberation Committee|Federal Slovenia]]''' || Part of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia\n|-\n| 1946\u20131963 || '''People's Republic of Slovenia''' || Part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n|-\n| 1963\u20131990 || '''Socialist Republic of Slovenia''' || Part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n|-\n| 1990\u2013present || '''Republic of Slovenia''' || Independent country from 1991\n|}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Slovenia}}\n\n=== Prehistory to Slavic settlement ===\n\n==== Prehistory ====\n[[File:Fl\u00fbte pal\u00e9olithique (mus\u00e9e national de Slov\u00e9nie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Divje Babe flute|pierced cave bear bone]], possibly a [[flute]], from [[Divje Babe]]]]\nPresent-day Slovenia has been inhabited since [[prehistoric]] times.

They were mostly Christianized by [[Irish people|Irish]] missionaries, among them [[Modestus (Apostle of Carantania)|Modestus]], known as the \"Apostle of Carantanians\". This process, together with the Christianization of the [[Bavarians]], was later described in the memorandum known as the [[Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum]], which is thought to have overemphasized the role of the Church of Salzburg in the Christianization process over similar efforts of the Patriarchate of [[Aquileia]].\n\n[[File:Kaernten herzogeinsetzung.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of an ancient democratic ritual of Slovene-speaking tribes, which took place on the [[Prince's Stone]] in the [[Slovene language]] until 1414.]]\n\nIn the mid-8th century, Carantania became a vassal duchy under the rule of the [[Bavaria]]ns, who began [[christianization|spreading Christianity]]. Three decades later, the [[Carantanians]] were incorporated, together with the Bavarians, into the [[Carolingian Empire]]. During the same period [[Carniola]], too, came under the Franks, and was Christianised from [[Aquileia]]. Following the anti-Frankish rebellion of [[Liudewit]] at the beginning of the 9th century, the [[Franks]] removed the Carantanian princes, replacing them with their own border dukes. Consequently, the Frankish [[feudal system]] reached the Slovene territory.\n\nAfter the victory of Emperor [[Otto I]] over the [[Magyars]] in 955, Slovene territory was divided into a number of border regions of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Carantania, being the most important, was elevated into the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] in 976.\n\nBy the 11th century, the Germanization of what is now [[Lower Austria]], effectively isolated the Slovene-inhabited territory from the other [[western Slavs]], speeding up the development of the [[Carantanians|Slavs of Carantania]] and of [[Carniola]] into an independent Carantanian/Carniolans/Slovene ethnic group. By the late Middle Ages, the historic provinces of Carniola, [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], [[County of Gorizia|Gorizia]], [[Trieste]], and [[Istria]] developed from the border regions and were incorporated into the medieval German state. The consolidation and formation of these historical lands took place in a long period between the 11th and 14th centuries, and were led by a number of important feudal families, such as the [[Bernhard von Spanheim|Dukes of Spannheim]], the [[Meinhardiner|Counts of Gorizia]], the [[Counts of Celje]], and, finally, the [[House of Habsburg]]. In a parallel process, an intensive German colonization significantly diminished the extent of Slovene-speaking areas. By the 15th century, the [[Slovene Lands|Slovene ethnic territory]] was reduced to its present size.<ref name=\"culture.si\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.si/en/Slovenia |title=About Slovenia \u2013 Culture of Slovenia |publisher=Culture.si |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century, most of the territory of present-day Slovenia was taken over by the [[Habsburgs]], the Hungarian clan [[Z\u00e1h (gens)|Z\u00e1h]] administering the territories connecting Slovenia with [[Slovakia]] and [[Moravia]] was exterminated in 1330 and the Slovenes permanently lost the connection with their [[Slovakia|Slovak]] kinsmen. The [[counts of Celje]], a feudal family from this area who in 1436 acquired the title of state princes, were [[Habsburgs]]' powerful competitors for some time. This large dynasty, important at a European political level, had its seat in Slovene territory but died out in 1456. Its numerous large estates subsequently became the property of the Habsburgs, who retained control of the area right up until the beginning of the 20th century. [[Patria del Friuli]] ruled present western Slovenia until [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] takeover in 1420.\n\n[[File:Boj s Turki-Valvasor.jpg|thumb|The Ottoman army battling the [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars|Habsburgs]] in present-day Slovenia during the [[Great Turkish War]].]]\nAt the end of the Middle Ages, the [[Slovene Lands]] suffered a serious economic and demographic setback because of the [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars|Turkish raids]].

The other locations in the United States where many Slovenians settled were areas with substantial industrial and mining activities: Pittsburgh, Chicago, Pueblo, Butte, northern Minnesota, and the Salt Lake Valley.

The idea of a [[United Slovenia]], first advanced during the [[revolutions of 1848]], became the common platform of most Slovenian parties and political movements in Austria-Hungary.

A [[socialist state]] was established, but because of the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split]] in 1948, economic and personal freedoms were broader than in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. In 1947, the [[Slovene Littoral]] and the western half of [[Inner Carniola]], which had been annexed by [[Italy]] after World War One, were annexed to Slovenia.\n\nAfter the failure of [[Collective farming|forced collectivisation]] that was attempted from 1949\u201353, a policy of gradual economic liberalisation, known as [[Workers' self-management|workers self-management]], was introduced under the advice and supervision of the Slovene Marxist theoretician and Communist leader [[Edvard Kardelj]], the main ideologue of the [[Titoism|Titoist]] path to socialism. Suspected opponents of this policy both from within and outside the Communist party were persecuted and thousands were sent to [[Goli otok]].\n\nThe late 1950s saw a policy of liberalisation in the cultural sphere, as well, and limited border crossing into neighboring Italy and Austria was allowed again. Until the 1980s, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]] enjoyed relatively broad autonomy within the federation. In 1956, [[Josip Broz Tito]], together with other leaders, founded the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Particularly in the 1950s, Slovenia's economy developed rapidly and was strongly industrialised. With further economic decentralisation of Yugoslavia in 1965\u201366, Slovenia's domestic product was 2.5 times the average of Yugoslav republics.\n\nOpposition to the regime was mostly limited to intellectual and literary circles, and became especially vocal after Tito's death in 1980, when the economic and political situation in Yugoslavia became very strained.<ref name=\"culture.si\"/> Political disputes around economic measures were echoed in the public sentiment, as many Slovenians felt they were being economically exploited, having to sustain an expensive and inefficient federal administration.\n\n=== Slovenian Spring, democracy and independence ===\nIn 1987 a group of intellectuals demanded Slovene independence in the [[Contributions for the Slovenian National Program|57th edition]] of the magazine ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''. Demands for democratisation and more Slovenian independence were sparked off. A mass democratic movement, coordinated by the [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]], pushed the Communists in the direction of democratic reforms.\n\nIn September 1989, numerous [[constitutional amendment]]s were passed to introduce [[parliamentary democracy]] to Slovenia.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.fdv.si/zalozba/pdf-ji/135.pdf |title=Razvoj parlamentarizma: funkcije sodobnih parlamentov |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Development of Parliamentarism: The Functions of Modern Parliaments |first=Drago |last=Zajc |page=109 |publisher=Publishing House of the Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Ljubljana |year=2004 |isbn=961-235-170-8 |access-date=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426072954/http://www.fdv.si/zalozba/pdf-ji/135.pdf |archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.svz.gov.si/si/zakonodaja_in_dokumenti/osamosvojitveni_akti_republike_slovenije/ |title=Osamosvojitveni akti Republike Slovenije |language=Slovenian |publisher=Office for Legislation, Government of the Republic of Slovenia |accessdate=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117183414/http://www.svz.gov.si/si/zakonodaja_in_dokumenti/osamosvojitveni_akti_republike_slovenije/ |archive-date=17 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> <!--The same year [[Rally of Truth|Action North]] united both the opposition and democratized communist establishment in Slovenia as the first defense action against attacks by [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]'s supporters, leading to Slovenian independence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fvv.uni-mb.si/varstvoslovje/Abstract.aspx?cid=329|title=Historical Circumstances in Which \"The Rally of Truth\" in Ljubljana Was Prevented|publisher=Journal of Criminal Justice and Security|accessdate=4 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213053210/http://www.fvv.uni-mb.si/varstvoslovje/Abstract.aspx?cid=329|archivedate=13 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/osamosvojitev/prispevek/108/predvajaj/|title=\"Rally of truth\" (Miting resnice)|publisher= A documentary published by [[RTV Slovenija]]|accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref>{{request quotation|date=July 2012}}--> On 7 March 1990, the Slovenian Assembly changed the official name of the state to the \"Republic of Slovenia\".<ref name=\"twenty.si\">{{cite web|author=Innovatif and ORG.TEND |url=http://www.twenty.si/first-20-years/90/ |title=Year 1990 &#124; Slovenia 20 years |publisher=Twenty.si |date=14 May 1992 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.uradni-list.si/dl/vip_akti/1990-02-0402.pdf |title=Odlok o razglasitvi ustavnih amandmajev k ustave<!-- sic! --> Socialisti\u010dne Republike Slovenije |language=Slovenian |journal=Uradni List Republike Slovenije |date=16 March 1990 |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref> In April 1990, the first democratic election in Slovenia took place, and the united opposition movement [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia|DEMOS]] led by [[Jo\u017ee Pu\u010dnik]] emerged victorious.\n[[File:Teritorialci so z armbrustom zadeli tank v kri\u017ei\u0161\u010du pred MMP Ro\u017ena Dolina..jpg|thumb|left|Slovenian Territorial Defense Units counterattacking the Yugoslav National Army tank who entered Slovenia during the [[Ten-Day War]], 1991]]\nThe initial revolutionary events in Slovenia pre-dated the [[Revolutions of 1989]] in Eastern Europe by almost a year, but went largely unnoticed by international observers.

Besides these, there are three winds of particular regional importance: the [[bora (wind)|bora]], the [[jugo]], and the [[foehn wind|foehn]]. The jugo and the bora are characteristic of the Littoral. Whereas the jugo is humid and warm, the bora is usually cold and gusty. The foehn is typical of the Alpine regions in the north of Slovenia.

During the first term of [[Janez Jan\u0161a]]'s government, for the first time after independence, the Slovenian banks saw their [[loan-deposit ratio]]s veering out of control. There was over-borrowing from foreign banks and then over-crediting of customers, including local [[business magnates]].\n\nAfter the onset of the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]] and [[European sovereign-debt crisis]], the left-wing coalition that replaced Jan\u0161a's government in the 2008 elections, had to face the consequences of the 2005\u20132008 over-borrowing. Attempts to implement reforms that would help economic recovery were met by student protesters, led by a student who later became a member of [[Janez Jan\u0161a]]'s [[Slovenska demokratska stranka|SDS]], and by the trade unions. The proposed reforms were postponed in a referendum. The left-wing government was ousted with a vote of no confidence. Janez Jan\u0161a attributed the boom of spending and overborrowing to the period of left-wing government; he proposed harsh austerity reforms which he had previously helped postpone. Generally, some economists estimate that left and right parties attributed to over-loaning and managers' takeovers; reason behind was that each block tried to establish economic elite which will support political forces.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pavlov\u010di\u010d|first1=Idija|title=Jo\u017ee P.

The [[Constitutional Court of Slovenia|Constitutional Court]], composed of nine judges elected for nine-year terms, decides on the conformity of laws with the Constitution; all laws and regulations must also conform with the general principles of international law and with ratified international agreements.<ref name=\"culture.si\"/>\n\n=== Administrative divisions and traditional regions ===\n{{Main|Statistical regions of Slovenia|Municipalities of Slovenia}}\n{| class=\"infobox bordered\" style=\"width: auto;\"\n|+ Traditional regions of Slovenia\n|-\n||[[File:Borders of the Historical Habsburgian Lands in the Republic of Slovenia.png|center|275px]]\n|-\n| <center> <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''1'''</span> [[Slovene Littoral]]; <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''Carniola:''' <br /> '''2a'''</span> [[Upper Carniola|Upper]], <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''2b'''</span> [[Inner Carniola|Inner]], <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''2c'''</span> [[Lower Carniola|Lower]] <br/> <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''3'''</span> [[Slovene Carinthia|Carinthia]]; <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''4'''</span> [[Styria (Slovenia)|Styria]]; <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''5'''</span> [[Prekmurje]]</center>\n|}\n\n==== Municipalities ====\nOfficially, Slovenia is subdivided into 212 [[municipalities]] (eleven of which have the status of urban municipalities). The municipalities are the only bodies of local autonomy in Slovenia. Each municipality is headed by a mayor (''\u017eupan''), elected every four years by popular vote, and a municipal council (''ob\u010dinski svet''). In the majority of municipalities, the municipal council is elected through the system of [[proportional representation]]; only a few smaller municipalities use the [[plurality voting system]]. In the urban municipalities, the municipal councils are called town (or city) councils.<ref name=\"www2.gov.si\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.si/zak/Zak_vel.nsf/0/660b7ab7cbd45736c125662d0037c142?OpenDocument |title=Sprejet zakon |publisher=.gov.si |date=13 July 2000 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> Every municipality also has a Head of the Municipal Administration (''na\u010delnik ob\u010dinske uprave''), appointed by the mayor, who is responsible for the functioning of the local administration.<ref name=\"www2.gov.si\"/>\n\n[[File:Slovenia, administrative divisions - Nmbrs (statistical regions) - colored.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Statistical regions: 1.&nbsp;Gorizia, 2.&nbsp;Upper Carniola, 3.&nbsp;Carinthia, 4.&nbsp;Drava, 5.&nbsp;Mura, 6.&nbsp;Central Slovenia, 7.&nbsp;Central Sava, 8.&nbsp;Savinja, 9.&nbsp;Coastal\u2013Karst, 10.&nbsp;Inner Carniola\u2013Karst, 11.&nbsp;Southeast Slovenia, 12.&nbsp;Lower Sava]]\n\n==== Administrative districts ====\nThere is no official intermediate unit between the municipalities and the Republic of Slovenia.

Avant-garde [[european classical music|classical music]] arose in Slovenia in the 1960s, largely due to the work of [[Uro\u0161 Krek]], [[Dane Skerl|Dane \u0160kerl]], [[Primoz Ramovs|Primo\u017e Ramov\u0161]] and [[Ivo Petric|Ivo Petri\u0107]], who also conducted the [[Slavko Osterc Ensemble]]. [[Jakob Jez|Jakob Je\u017e]], [[Darijan Bo\u017ei\u010d]], [[Lojze Lebic|Lojze Lebi\u010d]] and [[Vinko Globokar]] have since composed enduring works, especially Globokar's ''[[L'Armonia (opera)|L'Armonia]]'', an opera.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nModern composers include [[Uros Rojko|Uro\u0161 Rojko]], [[Tomaz Svete|Toma\u017e Svete]], [[Brina Jez-Brezavscek|Brina Je\u017e-Brezav\u0161\u010dek]], [[Bo\u017eidar Kantu\u0161er]] and [[Aldo Kumar]].

Slovenian folk songs, thus, usually resounds soft and harmonious, and are very seldom in minor. Traditional Slovenian folk music is performed on Styrian harmonica (the oldest type of accordion), fiddle, clarinet, [[zither]]s, flute, and by brass bands of alpine type. In [[Prekmurje|eastern Slovenia]], fiddle and cimbalon bands are called [[velike goslarije]].\n\n====Modern folk (Slovenian country) music====\n[[File:Slak lojze.jpg|thumbnail|left|Folk musician [[Lojze Slak]]]]\nFrom 1952 on, the [[Slavko Avsenik]]'s band began to appear in broadcasts, movies, and concerts all over the [[West Germany]], inventing the original \"[[Gorenjska|Oberkrainer]]\" country sound that has become the primary vehicle of ethnic musical expression not only in Slovenia, but also in Germany, [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], and in the [[Benelux]], spawning hundreds of [[Alps|Alpine]] orchestras in the process. The band produced nearly 1000 original compositions, an integral part of the [[Slovenian-style polka]] legacy.

It is thus a [[cognate]] of the words [[Slavonia]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slavs|Slavia]]. The etymology of {{wikt-lang|en|Slav}} itself remains uncertain.\n\nThe reconstructed autonym ''{{lang|sla|*Slov\u011bnin\u044a}}'' is usually derived from the word ''slovo'' (\"word\"), originally denoting \"people who speak (the same language),\" i.&nbsp;e. people who understand each other. This is in contrast to the Slavic word denoting German people, namely {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*n\u011bm\u044cc\u044c}}, meaning \"silent, mute people\" (from Slavic {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*n\u011bm\u044a}} \"[[muteness|mute]], mumbling\"). The word ''slovo'' (\"word\") and the related ''slava'' (\"glory, fame\") and ''slukh'' (\"hearing\") originate from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root {{wikt-lang|ine-pro|*\u1e31lew-}} (\"be spoken of, glory\"), cognate with Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{grc-tr|\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} \"fame\"), as in the name [[Pericles]], Latin {{wikt-lang|la|clueo}} (\"be called\"), and English {{wikt-lang|en|loud}}.\n\nThe modern Slovene state originates from the [[Slovene National Liberation Committee]] (SNOS) held on 19 February 1944. They officially named the state as ''Federal Slovenia'' ({{lang|sl|Federalna Slovenija}}), a unit within the Yugoslav federation. On 20 February 1946, Federal Slovenia was renamed the ''People's Republic of Slovenia'' (''Ljudska republika Slovenija'').<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-AFGPZB0W/? |title=Mesto kot upravnoteritorialna enota 1945\u20131955 |language=Slovenian, English |trans-title=A Town as an Administrative\u2013Territorial Unit |first=Janez |last=Kopa\u010d |year=2007 |volume=30 |issue=2 |publisher=Arhivsko dru\u0161tvo Slovenije |id={{COBISS|ID=914293}} |page=83 |journal=Arhivi |issn=0351-2835 |access-date=30 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180831002448/http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-AFGPZB0W/ |archive-date=31 August 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It retained this name until 9 April 1963, when its name was changed again, this time to ''Socialist Republic of Slovenia'' ({{lang-sl|Socialisti\u010dna republika Slovenija}}).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:9842 |title=Ustava Socialisti\u010dne republike Slovenije z dne 9. aprila 1963 |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia from 9 April 1963 |first=Janez |last=Kopa\u010d |journal=Arhivi |year=2001 |volume=XXIV |issue=1 |page=1 |access-date=30 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232837/http://sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:9842 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On 8 March 1990, SR Slovenia removed the prefix \"Socialist\" from its name, becoming the ''Republic of Slovenia''; it remained a part of the SFRY until 25 June 1991.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:center; clear:right;\"\n|+Official names\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1945\u20131946 || '''[[Slovene National Liberation Committee|Federal Slovenia]]''' || Part of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia\n|-\n| 1946\u20131963 || '''People's Republic of Slovenia''' || Part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n|-\n| 1963\u20131990 || '''Socialist Republic of Slovenia''' || Part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]\n|-\n| 1990\u2013present || '''Republic of Slovenia''' || Independent country from 1991\n|}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Slovenia}}\n\n=== Prehistory to Slavic settlement ===\n\n==== Prehistory ====\n[[File:Fl\u00fbte pal\u00e9olithique (mus\u00e9e national de Slov\u00e9nie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Divje Babe flute|pierced cave bear bone]], possibly a [[flute]], from [[Divje Babe]]]]\nPresent-day Slovenia has been inhabited since [[prehistoric]] times.

They were mostly Christianized by [[Irish people|Irish]] missionaries, among them [[Modestus (Apostle of Carantania)|Modestus]], known as the \"Apostle of Carantanians\". This process, together with the Christianization of the [[Bavarians]], was later described in the memorandum known as the [[Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum]], which is thought to have overemphasized the role of the Church of Salzburg in the Christianization process over similar efforts of the Patriarchate of [[Aquileia]].\n\n[[File:Kaernten herzogeinsetzung.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of an ancient democratic ritual of Slovene-speaking tribes, which took place on the [[Prince's Stone]] in the [[Slovene language]] until 1414.]]\n\nIn the mid-8th century, Carantania became a vassal duchy under the rule of the [[Bavaria]]ns, who began [[christianization|spreading Christianity]]. Three decades later, the [[Carantanians]] were incorporated, together with the Bavarians, into the [[Carolingian Empire]]. During the same period [[Carniola]], too, came under the Franks, and was Christianised from [[Aquileia]]. Following the anti-Frankish rebellion of [[Liudewit]] at the beginning of the 9th century, the [[Franks]] removed the Carantanian princes, replacing them with their own border dukes. Consequently, the Frankish [[feudal system]] reached the Slovene territory.\n\nAfter the victory of Emperor [[Otto I]] over the [[Magyars]] in 955, Slovene territory was divided into a number of border regions of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Carantania, being the most important, was elevated into the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] in 976.\n\nBy the 11th century, the Germanization of what is now [[Lower Austria]], effectively isolated the Slovene-inhabited territory from the other [[western Slavs]], speeding up the development of the [[Carantanians|Slavs of Carantania]] and of [[Carniola]] into an independent Carantanian/Carniolans/Slovene ethnic group. By the late Middle Ages, the historic provinces of Carniola, [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], [[County of Gorizia|Gorizia]], [[Trieste]], and [[Istria]] developed from the border regions and were incorporated into the medieval German state. The consolidation and formation of these historical lands took place in a long period between the 11th and 14th centuries, and were led by a number of important feudal families, such as the [[Bernhard von Spanheim|Dukes of Spannheim]], the [[Meinhardiner|Counts of Gorizia]], the [[Counts of Celje]], and, finally, the [[House of Habsburg]]. In a parallel process, an intensive German colonization significantly diminished the extent of Slovene-speaking areas. By the 15th century, the [[Slovene Lands|Slovene ethnic territory]] was reduced to its present size.<ref name=\"culture.si\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.si/en/Slovenia |title=About Slovenia \u2013 Culture of Slovenia |publisher=Culture.si |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century, most of the territory of present-day Slovenia was taken over by the [[Habsburgs]], the Hungarian clan [[Z\u00e1h (gens)|Z\u00e1h]] administering the territories connecting Slovenia with [[Slovakia]] and [[Moravia]] was exterminated in 1330 and the Slovenes permanently lost the connection with their [[Slovakia|Slovak]] kinsmen. The [[counts of Celje]], a feudal family from this area who in 1436 acquired the title of state princes, were [[Habsburgs]]' powerful competitors for some time. This large dynasty, important at a European political level, had its seat in Slovene territory but died out in 1456. Its numerous large estates subsequently became the property of the Habsburgs, who retained control of the area right up until the beginning of the 20th century. [[Patria del Friuli]] ruled present western Slovenia until [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] takeover in 1420.\n\n[[File:Boj s Turki-Valvasor.jpg|thumb|The Ottoman army battling the [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars|Habsburgs]] in present-day Slovenia during the [[Great Turkish War]].]]\nAt the end of the Middle Ages, the [[Slovene Lands]] suffered a serious economic and demographic setback because of the [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars|Turkish raids]].

The other locations in the United States where many Slovenians settled were areas with substantial industrial and mining activities: Pittsburgh, Chicago, Pueblo, Butte, northern Minnesota, and the Salt Lake Valley.

The idea of a [[United Slovenia]], first advanced during the [[revolutions of 1848]], became the common platform of most Slovenian parties and political movements in Austria-Hungary.

A [[socialist state]] was established, but because of the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split]] in 1948, economic and personal freedoms were broader than in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. In 1947, the [[Slovene Littoral]] and the western half of [[Inner Carniola]], which had been annexed by [[Italy]] after World War One, were annexed to Slovenia.\n\nAfter the failure of [[Collective farming|forced collectivisation]] that was attempted from 1949\u201353, a policy of gradual economic liberalisation, known as [[Workers' self-management|workers self-management]], was introduced under the advice and supervision of the Slovene Marxist theoretician and Communist leader [[Edvard Kardelj]], the main ideologue of the [[Titoism|Titoist]] path to socialism. Suspected opponents of this policy both from within and outside the Communist party were persecuted and thousands were sent to [[Goli otok]].\n\nThe late 1950s saw a policy of liberalisation in the cultural sphere, as well, and limited border crossing into neighboring Italy and Austria was allowed again. Until the 1980s, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]] enjoyed relatively broad autonomy within the federation. In 1956, [[Josip Broz Tito]], together with other leaders, founded the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Particularly in the 1950s, Slovenia's economy developed rapidly and was strongly industrialised. With further economic decentralisation of Yugoslavia in 1965\u201366, Slovenia's domestic product was 2.5 times the average of Yugoslav republics.\n\nOpposition to the regime was mostly limited to intellectual and literary circles, and became especially vocal after Tito's death in 1980, when the economic and political situation in Yugoslavia became very strained.<ref name=\"culture.si\"/> Political disputes around economic measures were echoed in the public sentiment, as many Slovenians felt they were being economically exploited, having to sustain an expensive and inefficient federal administration.\n\n=== Slovenian Spring, democracy and independence ===\nIn 1987 a group of intellectuals demanded Slovene independence in the [[Contributions for the Slovenian National Program|57th edition]] of the magazine ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''. Demands for democratisation and more Slovenian independence were sparked off. A mass democratic movement, coordinated by the [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]], pushed the Communists in the direction of democratic reforms.\n\nIn September 1989, numerous [[constitutional amendment]]s were passed to introduce [[parliamentary democracy]] to Slovenia.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.fdv.si/zalozba/pdf-ji/135.pdf |title=Razvoj parlamentarizma: funkcije sodobnih parlamentov |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Development of Parliamentarism: The Functions of Modern Parliaments |first=Drago |last=Zajc |page=109 |publisher=Publishing House of the Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Ljubljana |year=2004 |isbn=961-235-170-8 |access-date=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426072954/http://www.fdv.si/zalozba/pdf-ji/135.pdf |archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.svz.gov.si/si/zakonodaja_in_dokumenti/osamosvojitveni_akti_republike_slovenije/ |title=Osamosvojitveni akti Republike Slovenije |language=Slovenian |publisher=Office for Legislation, Government of the Republic of Slovenia |accessdate=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117183414/http://www.svz.gov.si/si/zakonodaja_in_dokumenti/osamosvojitveni_akti_republike_slovenije/ |archive-date=17 January 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> <!--The same year [[Rally of Truth|Action North]] united both the opposition and democratized communist establishment in Slovenia as the first defense action against attacks by [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]'s supporters, leading to Slovenian independence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fvv.uni-mb.si/varstvoslovje/Abstract.aspx?cid=329|title=Historical Circumstances in Which \"The Rally of Truth\" in Ljubljana Was Prevented|publisher=Journal of Criminal Justice and Security|accessdate=4 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213053210/http://www.fvv.uni-mb.si/varstvoslovje/Abstract.aspx?cid=329|archivedate=13 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/osamosvojitev/prispevek/108/predvajaj/|title=\"Rally of truth\" (Miting resnice)|publisher= A documentary published by [[RTV Slovenija]]|accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref>{{request quotation|date=July 2012}}--> On 7 March 1990, the Slovenian Assembly changed the official name of the state to the \"Republic of Slovenia\".<ref name=\"twenty.si\">{{cite web|author=Innovatif and ORG.TEND |url=http://www.twenty.si/first-20-years/90/ |title=Year 1990 &#124; Slovenia 20 years |publisher=Twenty.si |date=14 May 1992 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.uradni-list.si/dl/vip_akti/1990-02-0402.pdf |title=Odlok o razglasitvi ustavnih amandmajev k ustave<!-- sic! --> Socialisti\u010dne Republike Slovenije |language=Slovenian |journal=Uradni List Republike Slovenije |date=16 March 1990 |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref> In April 1990, the first democratic election in Slovenia took place, and the united opposition movement [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia|DEMOS]] led by [[Jo\u017ee Pu\u010dnik]] emerged victorious.\n[[File:Teritorialci so z armbrustom zadeli tank v kri\u017ei\u0161\u010du pred MMP Ro\u017ena Dolina..jpg|thumb|left|Slovenian Territorial Defense Units counterattacking the Yugoslav National Army tank who entered Slovenia during the [[Ten-Day War]], 1991]]\nThe initial revolutionary events in Slovenia pre-dated the [[Revolutions of 1989]] in Eastern Europe by almost a year, but went largely unnoticed by international observers.

Besides these, there are three winds of particular regional importance: the [[bora (wind)|bora]], the [[jugo]], and the [[foehn wind|foehn]]. The jugo and the bora are characteristic of the Littoral. Whereas the jugo is humid and warm, the bora is usually cold and gusty. The foehn is typical of the Alpine regions in the north of Slovenia.

During the first term of [[Janez Jan\u0161a]]'s government, for the first time after independence, the Slovenian banks saw their [[loan-deposit ratio]]s veering out of control. There was over-borrowing from foreign banks and then over-crediting of customers, including local [[business magnates]].\n\nAfter the onset of the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]] and [[European sovereign-debt crisis]], the left-wing coalition that replaced Jan\u0161a's government in the 2008 elections, had to face the consequences of the 2005\u20132008 over-borrowing. Attempts to implement reforms that would help economic recovery were met by student protesters, led by a student who later became a member of [[Janez Jan\u0161a]]'s [[Slovenska demokratska stranka|SDS]], and by the trade unions. The proposed reforms were postponed in a referendum. The left-wing government was ousted with a vote of no confidence. Janez Jan\u0161a attributed the boom of spending and overborrowing to the period of left-wing government; he proposed harsh austerity reforms which he had previously helped postpone. Generally, some economists estimate that left and right parties attributed to over-loaning and managers' takeovers; reason behind was that each block tried to establish economic elite which will support political forces.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pavlov\u010di\u010d|first1=Idija|title=Jo\u017ee P.

The [[Constitutional Court of Slovenia|Constitutional Court]], composed of nine judges elected for nine-year terms, decides on the conformity of laws with the Constitution; all laws and regulations must also conform with the general principles of international law and with ratified international agreements.<ref name=\"culture.si\"/>\n\n=== Administrative divisions and traditional regions ===\n{{Main|Statistical regions of Slovenia|Municipalities of Slovenia}}\n{| class=\"infobox bordered\" style=\"width: auto;\"\n|+ Traditional regions of Slovenia\n|-\n||[[File:Borders of the Historical Habsburgian Lands in the Republic of Slovenia.png|center|275px]]\n|-\n| <center> <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''1'''</span> [[Slovene Littoral]]; <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''Carniola:''' <br /> '''2a'''</span> [[Upper Carniola|Upper]], <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''2b'''</span> [[Inner Carniola|Inner]], <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''2c'''</span> [[Lower Carniola|Lower]] <br/> <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''3'''</span> [[Slovene Carinthia|Carinthia]]; <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''4'''</span> [[Styria (Slovenia)|Styria]]; <span style=\"color:#3f3f3f\">'''5'''</span> [[Prekmurje]]</center>\n|}\n\n==== Municipalities ====\nOfficially, Slovenia is subdivided into 212 [[municipalities]] (eleven of which have the status of urban municipalities). The municipalities are the only bodies of local autonomy in Slovenia. Each municipality is headed by a mayor (''\u017eupan''), elected every four years by popular vote, and a municipal council (''ob\u010dinski svet''). In the majority of municipalities, the municipal council is elected through the system of [[proportional representation]]; only a few smaller municipalities use the [[plurality voting system]]. In the urban municipalities, the municipal councils are called town (or city) councils.<ref name=\"www2.gov.si\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.si/zak/Zak_vel.nsf/0/660b7ab7cbd45736c125662d0037c142?OpenDocument |title=Sprejet zakon |publisher=.gov.si |date=13 July 2000 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> Every municipality also has a Head of the Municipal Administration (''na\u010delnik ob\u010dinske uprave''), appointed by the mayor, who is responsible for the functioning of the local administration.<ref name=\"www2.gov.si\"/>\n\n[[File:Slovenia, administrative divisions - Nmbrs (statistical regions) - colored.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Statistical regions: 1.&nbsp;Gorizia, 2.&nbsp;Upper Carniola, 3.&nbsp;Carinthia, 4.&nbsp;Drava, 5.&nbsp;Mura, 6.&nbsp;Central Slovenia, 7.&nbsp;Central Sava, 8.&nbsp;Savinja, 9.&nbsp;Coastal\u2013Karst, 10.&nbsp;Inner Carniola\u2013Karst, 11.&nbsp;Southeast Slovenia, 12.&nbsp;Lower Sava]]\n\n==== Administrative districts ====\nThere is no official intermediate unit between the municipalities and the Republic of Slovenia.

Avant-garde [[european classical music|classical music]] arose in Slovenia in the 1960s, largely due to the work of [[Uro\u0161 Krek]], [[Dane Skerl|Dane \u0160kerl]], [[Primoz Ramovs|Primo\u017e Ramov\u0161]] and [[Ivo Petric|Ivo Petri\u0107]], who also conducted the [[Slavko Osterc Ensemble]]. [[Jakob Jez|Jakob Je\u017e]], [[Darijan Bo\u017ei\u010d]], [[Lojze Lebic|Lojze Lebi\u010d]] and [[Vinko Globokar]] have since composed enduring works, especially Globokar's ''[[L'Armonia (opera)|L'Armonia]]'', an opera.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nModern composers include [[Uros Rojko|Uro\u0161 Rojko]], [[Tomaz Svete|Toma\u017e Svete]], [[Brina Jez-Brezavscek|Brina Je\u017e-Brezav\u0161\u010dek]], [[Bo\u017eidar Kantu\u0161er]] and [[Aldo Kumar]].

Slovenian folk songs, thus, usually resounds soft and harmonious, and are very seldom in minor. Traditional Slovenian folk music is performed on Styrian harmonica (the oldest type of accordion), fiddle, clarinet, [[zither]]s, flute, and by brass bands of alpine type. In [[Prekmurje|eastern Slovenia]], fiddle and cimbalon bands are called [[velike goslarije]].\n\n====Modern folk (Slovenian country) music====\n[[File:Slak lojze.jpg|thumbnail|left|Folk musician [[Lojze Slak]]]]\nFrom 1952 on, the [[Slavko Avsenik]]'s band began to appear in broadcasts, movies, and concerts all over the [[West Germany]], inventing the original \"[[Gorenjska|Oberkrainer]]\" country sound that has become the primary vehicle of ethnic musical expression not only in Slovenia, but also in Germany, [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], and in the [[Benelux]], spawning hundreds of [[Alps|Alpine]] orchestras in the process. The band produced nearly 1000 original compositions, an integral part of the [[Slovenian-style polka]] legacy.

The first line was opened in 1992, connecting the cities of [[Madrid]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Seville]]. Unlike the rest of the [[Iberian gauge|Iberian broad gauge]] network, the AVE uses [[standard gauge]]. This permits direct connections to outside Spain through the link to the French network at the [[Perthus tunnel]]. AVE trains are operated by RENFE, but private companies may be allowed to operate trains in the future using other brands, in accordance with [[EU Directive 91/440|European Union legislation]]. Some TGV-derived trains used to run on the broad-gauge network at slower speeds, but these were branded separately as [[Euromed (train)|Euromed]] until new rolling stock was commissioned for these services.\n\n== History ==\n{{imagestack|\n[[File:Spain High Speed Rail.svg|thumb|right|Map showing high-speed ''railway lines'' currently (January 2020) in operation.]]\n[[File:HighSpeedSpain.svg|thumb|right|Map showing ''high-speed lines'' already in operation, under construction or planned (''updated January 2020'').]]\n}}\n\n=== New rail link to Andalusia ===\n{{Main|Madrid\u2013Seville high-speed rail line|Madrid\u2013M\u00e1laga high-speed rail line}}\nTowards the end of the 1980s a new line was planned to join the Castilian [[Meseta Central|Meseta]] with [[Andalusia]] without passing through the [[Despe\u00f1aperros|Despe\u00f1aperros Natural Park]]. After considering various options it was decided that a standard-gauge line, allowing for Spain's first high-speed rail link, would be built. The project was named NAFA (''Nuevo Acceso Ferroviario a Andaluc\u00eda'', New Rail Link to Andalusia) and was meant to help revitalise the stagnant southern Spanish economy. The line was inaugurated on 14 April 1992 to coincide with [[Seville Expo '92|Expo 92]] being held in Seville. Seven days later on 21 April 1992 commercial service began with six daily services stopping at [[Madrid]], [[Seville]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Puertollano]] and [[Ciudad Real]]. In October 1992 RENFE began the AVE Lanzadera (Shuttle) service between Madrid and Puertollano and Ciudad Real.\n\nIt has been suggested that the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] government chose the French [[Alstom]] bid over the [[Siemens]] and [[Talgo]] bids for political rather than technical reasons, rewarding the French government for its assistance in capturing [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] activists who took \"[[sanctuary]]\" across the border in southern France.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.diariolatorre.es/index.php?id=39&tx_ttnews%5bpointer%5d=6&tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=4021&tx_ttnews%5bbackPid%5d=46&cHash=e01ceacfd2 |title=Rafa S\u00e1nchez, concejal del PSOE: \"Gerardo Velasco es un mal educado\" - interview with Rafa S\u00e1nchez |date=10 August 2007 |accessdate=17 October 2008 |language=Spanish |newspaper=Diario La Torre | location = M\u00e1laga}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Los d\u00edas de Argel: cr\u00f3nica de las conversaciones ETA-Gobierno espa\u00f1ol|date=1992|author=I\u00f1aki Ega\u00f1a|publisher=Txalaparta|pages=32\u201333}}</ref> Seville's hosting of the [[Seville Expo '92|1992 World's Fair]] prompted the choice of that city for the inaugural AVE line, with its being the home town of then Spanish president [[Felipe Gonzalez]]  also  playing some role. Seville is the artistic, cultural, and financial capital of southern Spain and the [[:es:Lista de ciudades espa\u00f1olas por poblaci\u00f3n|fourth largest city in Spain]], after Madrid, [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia]], with a population of over 700,000 and a metropolitan area of almost 1.5 million people. It is also the capital of Andalusia, Spain's most populous [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] (region).\n\nIn January 1993 the ''Talgo 200 Madrid\u2013M\u00e1laga'' service began, using AVE lines as far as C\u00f3rdoba and then the [[C\u00f3rdoba\u2013M\u00e1laga railway|C\u00f3rdoba\u2013M\u00e1laga]] Spanish-gauge conventional track to reach [[M\u00e1laga]]. On 23 April that year, the AVE set a new top speed of {{convert|356.8|km/h|abbr=on}} on a test run. Later in 1993 the mixed-method services ''Talgo 200 Madrid\u2013C\u00e1diz'' and ''Talgo 200 Madrid\u2013Huelva'' began.\n\nIn 1994 AVE trains on the Madrid\u2013Seville line began to run at 300&nbsp;km/h, cutting journey times by at least 40 minutes and covering the 471&nbsp;km in {{frac|2|1|2}} hours, though it is unlikely that much of a saving came from the increase in maximum speed, because only a small section of the line near Los Y\u00e9benes has the alignments for 300&nbsp;km/h operation.  The maximum permitted speed is 270&nbsp;km/h between Atocha station and Brazatortas, save for the approaches to the intermediate stations (Atocha, Ciudad Real and Puertollano). Beyond Brazatortas, the line is only authorised for 250&nbsp;km/h operation, which drops to 215&nbsp;km/h in the Sierra Morena mountains and 90&nbsp;km/h around C\u00f3rdoba station.<ref>Ferropedia. [http://ferropedia.es/wiki/LAV_Madrid_-_Sevilla#Velocidades_autorizadas. ''LAV Madrid-Sevilla''].</ref> It is more likely that time savings occurred as a result of there being fewer intermediate stops.\n\nAlthough in 1999 RENFE began a mixed-service ''Talgo 200 Madrid\u2013Algeciras'' route, this was, along with the other mixed services, transferred to ''Grandes L\u00edneas Renfe'' (RENFE's Spanish gauge long-distance brand) following changes to plans for high-speed rail in Spain.\n\nThe last segment of the [[Madrid\u2013M\u00e1laga high-speed rail line]] was completed on 24 December 2007 when the new high speed railway section between the cities of C\u00f3rdoba and M\u00e1laga was inaugurated. It is a standard gauge railway line of 155&nbsp;km in length and is designed for speeds of 300&nbsp;km/h (186&nbsp;mph). It has compatibility with neighbouring countries' railway systems as well.\n\nIn October 2015 an extension of the Madrid-Seville high-speed rail line to [[C\u00e1diz]] was completed after 14 years of works and put in service by [[Alvia]] trains for speeds up to 200&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=\"Cadiz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lavozdigital.es/cadiz-provincia/201510/01/alvia-cadiz-transporte-20151001153154-pr.html|language=Spanish |title=Fomento culmina la obra de alta velocidad entre Sevilla y C\u00e1diz|work=lavozdigital.es}}</ref> In 2019 the [[Antequera\u2013Granada high-speed rail line]] opened.\n\n=== {{anchor|AVANT}} AVANT&nbsp;\u2013 Media Distancia ===\n[[File:Renfe avant.jpg|thumb|right|Class 104 train.]]\n[[File:Serie 114 de Renfe en Valladolid-Campo Grande.jpg|thumb|right|Class 114 train.]]\n\nIn 1992, a new high-speed medium distance service (''AV Media Distancia'' operating under the AVE Lanzadera brand) began between Madrid, Ciudad Real and Puertollano, using spare class 100 trains. In November 2003 a new service began between Seville and C\u00f3rdoba using new class 104 trains,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/nuestros_trenes/avant114_ficha.html|title=Our Trains|website=www.renfe.com|language=en-UK|access-date=2018-07-25}}</ref> reducing journey times between the two cities to 40 minutes.\n\nIn 2005 the brand was renamed RENFE Avant, and all services started to use [[:es:Serie 104 de Renfe|class 104]] trains, leaving class 100 for AVE services.\n\nThe construction of a {{convert|21|km|adj=on}} stretch of high-speed line from Madrid to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] allowed the inauguration of a medium distance service in November 2005. The journey time between the two cities is now less than 30 minutes. The high-speed link combined with high property prices in Madrid has encouraged many Madrid commuters to settle in [[Ciudad Real]], the first stop on the Madrid\u2013Seville line. There has, however, been controversy over the construction of this line as the change to standard-gauge track meant that towns such as [[Getafe]], [[Aranjuez]] and [[Algodor]], which now have no commercial services, lost their direct services to Toledo. Furthermore, since Toledo is now connected by standard-gauge track it is impossible for other passenger or goods trains to reach it that have not come from other high-speed lines.\n\nFurther Avant services have been launched with the expansion of the AVE lines to [[Valladolid]], [[Barcelona]], M\u00e1laga and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. See below for details of all Avant services.\n\nIn the Valladolid line, new [[:es:Serie 114 de Renfe|class 114]] trains are used. Both Avant class 104 and class 114 trains are [[Pendolino]] designs, without tilting capacity:\n\n- Avant class 104 trains are based in [[ETR 480]]\n\n- Avant class 114 trains are based in [[ETR 600]]\n\n=== Madrid\u2013Barcelona ===\n{{Main|Madrid\u2013Barcelona high-speed rail line}}\nThe Madrid\u2013[[Zaragoza]] \u2013[[Barcelona]] line was inaugurated on 20 February 2008, after parts of the line had operated since 2003 (Madrid\u2013Zaragoza\u2013Lleida) and 2006 (Lleida\u2013Tarragona).

After considering various options it was decided that a standard-gauge line, allowing for Spain's first high-speed rail link, would be built. The project was named NAFA (''Nuevo Acceso Ferroviario a Andaluc\u00eda'', New Rail Link to Andalusia) and was meant to help revitalise the stagnant southern Spanish economy. The line was inaugurated on 14 April 1992 to coincide with [[Seville Expo '92|Expo 92]] being held in Seville. Seven days later on 21 April 1992 commercial service began with six daily services stopping at [[Madrid]], [[Seville]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Puertollano]] and [[Ciudad Real]]. In October 1992 RENFE began the AVE Lanzadera (Shuttle) service between Madrid and Puertollano and Ciudad Real.\n\nIt has been suggested that the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] government chose the French [[Alstom]] bid over the [[Siemens]] and [[Talgo]] bids for political rather than technical reasons, rewarding the French government for its assistance in capturing [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] activists who took \"[[sanctuary]]\" across the border in southern France.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.diariolatorre.es/index.php?id=39&tx_ttnews%5bpointer%5d=6&tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=4021&tx_ttnews%5bbackPid%5d=46&cHash=e01ceacfd2 |title=Rafa S\u00e1nchez, concejal del PSOE: \"Gerardo Velasco es un mal educado\" - interview with Rafa S\u00e1nchez |date=10 August 2007 |accessdate=17 October 2008 |language=Spanish |newspaper=Diario La Torre | location = M\u00e1laga}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Los d\u00edas de Argel: cr\u00f3nica de las conversaciones ETA-Gobierno espa\u00f1ol|date=1992|author=I\u00f1aki Ega\u00f1a|publisher=Txalaparta|pages=32\u201333}}</ref> Seville's hosting of the [[Seville Expo '92|1992 World's Fair]] prompted the choice of that city for the inaugural AVE line, with its being the home town of then Spanish president [[Felipe Gonzalez]]  also  playing some role. Seville is the artistic, cultural, and financial capital of southern Spain and the [[:es:Lista de ciudades espa\u00f1olas por poblaci\u00f3n|fourth largest city in Spain]], after Madrid, [[Barcelona]] and [[Valencia]], with a population of over 700,000 and a metropolitan area of almost 1.5 million people. It is also the capital of Andalusia, Spain's most populous [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] (region).\n\nIn January 1993 the ''Talgo 200 Madrid\u2013M\u00e1laga'' service began, using AVE lines as far as C\u00f3rdoba and then the [[C\u00f3rdoba\u2013M\u00e1laga railway|C\u00f3rdoba\u2013M\u00e1laga]] Spanish-gauge conventional track to reach [[M\u00e1laga]]. On 23 April that year, the AVE set a new top speed of {{convert|356.8|km/h|abbr=on}} on a test run. Later in 1993 the mixed-method services ''Talgo 200 Madrid\u2013C\u00e1diz'' and ''Talgo 200 Madrid\u2013Huelva'' began.\n\nIn 1994 AVE trains on the Madrid\u2013Seville line began to run at 300&nbsp;km/h, cutting journey times by at least 40 minutes and covering the 471&nbsp;km in {{frac|2|1|2}} hours, though it is unlikely that much of a saving came from the increase in maximum speed, because only a small section of the line near Los Y\u00e9benes has the alignments for 300&nbsp;km/h operation.  The maximum permitted speed is 270&nbsp;km/h between Atocha station and Brazatortas, save for the approaches to the intermediate stations (Atocha, Ciudad Real and Puertollano). Beyond Brazatortas, the line is only authorised for 250&nbsp;km/h operation, which drops to 215&nbsp;km/h in the Sierra Morena mountains and 90&nbsp;km/h around C\u00f3rdoba station.<ref>Ferropedia. [http://ferropedia.es/wiki/LAV_Madrid_-_Sevilla#Velocidades_autorizadas. ''LAV Madrid-Sevilla''].</ref> It is more likely that time savings occurred as a result of there being fewer intermediate stops.\n\nAlthough in 1999 RENFE began a mixed-service ''Talgo 200 Madrid\u2013Algeciras'' route, this was, along with the other mixed services, transferred to ''Grandes L\u00edneas Renfe'' (RENFE's Spanish gauge long-distance brand) following changes to plans for high-speed rail in Spain.\n\nThe last segment of the [[Madrid\u2013M\u00e1laga high-speed rail line]] was completed on 24 December 2007 when the new high speed railway section between the cities of C\u00f3rdoba and M\u00e1laga was inaugurated. It is a standard gauge railway line of 155&nbsp;km in length and is designed for speeds of 300&nbsp;km/h (186&nbsp;mph). It has compatibility with neighbouring countries' railway systems as well.\n\nIn October 2015 an extension of the Madrid-Seville high-speed rail line to [[C\u00e1diz]] was completed after 14 years of works and put in service by [[Alvia]] trains for speeds up to 200&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=\"Cadiz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lavozdigital.es/cadiz-provincia/201510/01/alvia-cadiz-transporte-20151001153154-pr.html|language=Spanish |title=Fomento culmina la obra de alta velocidad entre Sevilla y C\u00e1diz|work=lavozdigital.es}}</ref> In 2019 the [[Antequera\u2013Granada high-speed rail line]] opened.\n\n=== {{anchor|AVANT}} AVANT&nbsp;\u2013 Media Distancia ===\n[[File:Renfe avant.jpg|thumb|right|Class 104 train.]]\n[[File:Serie 114 de Renfe en Valladolid-Campo Grande.jpg|thumb|right|Class 114 train.]]\n\nIn 1992, a new high-speed medium distance service (''AV Media Distancia'' operating under the AVE Lanzadera brand) began between Madrid, Ciudad Real and Puertollano, using spare class 100 trains. In November 2003 a new service began between Seville and C\u00f3rdoba using new class 104 trains,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/nuestros_trenes/avant114_ficha.html|title=Our Trains|website=www.renfe.com|language=en-UK|access-date=2018-07-25}}</ref> reducing journey times between the two cities to 40 minutes.\n\nIn 2005 the brand was renamed RENFE Avant, and all services started to use [[:es:Serie 104 de Renfe|class 104]] trains, leaving class 100 for AVE services.\n\nThe construction of a {{convert|21|km|adj=on}} stretch of high-speed line from Madrid to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] allowed the inauguration of a medium distance service in November 2005. The journey time between the two cities is now less than 30 minutes. The high-speed link combined with high property prices in Madrid has encouraged many Madrid commuters to settle in [[Ciudad Real]], the first stop on the Madrid\u2013Seville line. There has, however, been controversy over the construction of this line as the change to standard-gauge track meant that towns such as [[Getafe]], [[Aranjuez]] and [[Algodor]], which now have no commercial services, lost their direct services to Toledo. Furthermore, since Toledo is now connected by standard-gauge track it is impossible for other passenger or goods trains to reach it that have not come from other high-speed lines.\n\nFurther Avant services have been launched with the expansion of the AVE lines to [[Valladolid]], [[Barcelona]], M\u00e1laga and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. See below for details of all Avant services.\n\nIn the Valladolid line, new [[:es:Serie 114 de Renfe|class 114]] trains are used. Both Avant class 104 and class 114 trains are [[Pendolino]] designs, without tilting capacity:\n\n- Avant class 104 trains are based in [[ETR 480]]\n\n- Avant class 114 trains are based in [[ETR 600]]\n\n=== Madrid\u2013Barcelona ===\n{{Main|Madrid\u2013Barcelona high-speed rail line}}\nThe Madrid\u2013[[Zaragoza]] \u2013[[Barcelona]] line was inaugurated on 20 February 2008, after parts of the line had operated since 2003 (Madrid\u2013Zaragoza\u2013Lleida) and 2006 (Lleida\u2013Tarragona).
