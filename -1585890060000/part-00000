Ezra led a large body of exiles back to Jerusalem, where he discovered that Jewish men had been marrying non-Jewish women. He tore his garments in despair and confessed the sins of Israel before God, then braved the opposition of some of his own countrymen to purify the community by enforcing the dissolution of the sinful marriages. Some years later Artaxerxes sent Nehemiah (a Jewish noble in his personal service) to Jerusalem as governor with the task of rebuilding the city walls. Once this task was completed Nehemiah had Ezra read the Law of Moses (the [[Torah]]) to the assembled Israelites, and the people and priests entered into a covenant to keep the law and separate themselves from all other peoples.\n\n==In later Second Temple period literature==\n\n===1 Esdras===\n[[1 Esdras]], probably from the late 2nd/early 1st centuries BCE, preserves a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] text of Ezra and a part of Nehemiah distinctly different from that of Ezra\u2013Nehemiah \u2013 in particular it eliminates Nehemiah from the story and gives some of his deeds to Ezra, as well as telling events in a different order. Scholars are divided on whether it is based on Ezra\u2013Nehemiah, or reflects an earlier literary stage before the combination of Ezra and Nehemiah accounts.\n\n===Josephus===\nThe first-century Jewish historian [[Josephus]] deals with Ezra in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]''. He uses the name Xerxes for Artaxerxes I reserving the name Artaxerxes for the later Artaxerxes II whom he identifies as the Ahasuerus of Esther, thus placing Ezra before the events of the book of Esther.  Josephus's account of the deeds of Ezra derives  entirely from [[1 Esdras]], which he cites as the 'Book of Ezra' in his numeration of the Hebrew bible.  Contrariwise, Josephus does not appear to recognise Ezra-Nehemiah as a biblical book, does not quote from it, and relies entirely on other traditions in his account of the deeds of [[Nehemiah]].\n\n===The apocalyptic Ezra traditions===\nThe [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[2 Esdras|fourth book of Ezra]] (also sometimes called the 'second book of Esdras' or the 'third book of Esdras') was written c. CE 100, probably in [[Judeo-Aramaic language|Hebrew-Aramaic]], but now survives in Latin, Slavonic and Ethiopic. It was one of the most important sources for [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish theology]] at the end of the 1st century.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} In this book, Ezra has a seven part prophetic revelation, converses with an [[angel]] of God three times and has four visions.

Another tradition locates his tomb near Basra, Iraq.\n\n==Ezra in Christian traditions==\nEarly Christian writers occasionally cited Ezra as author of the apocalyptic books attributed to him. [[Clement of Alexandria]] in his ''[[Stromata]]'' referred to Ezra as an example of prophetic inspiration, quoting a section from [[2 Esdras]]. Where early Christian writers refer to the 'Book of Ezra' it is always the text of [[1 Esdras]] that is being cited.

Ezra led a large body of exiles back to Jerusalem, where he discovered that Jewish men had been marrying non-Jewish women. He tore his garments in despair and confessed the sins of Israel before God, then braved the opposition of some of his own countrymen to purify the community by enforcing the dissolution of the sinful marriages. Some years later Artaxerxes sent Nehemiah (a Jewish noble in his personal service) to Jerusalem as governor with the task of rebuilding the city walls. Once this task was completed Nehemiah had Ezra read the Law of Moses (the [[Torah]]) to the assembled Israelites, and the people and priests entered into a covenant to keep the law and separate themselves from all other peoples.\n\n==In later Second Temple period literature==\n\n===1 Esdras===\n[[1 Esdras]], probably from the late 2nd/early 1st centuries BCE, preserves a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] text of Ezra and a part of Nehemiah distinctly different from that of Ezra\u2013Nehemiah \u2013 in particular it eliminates Nehemiah from the story and gives some of his deeds to Ezra, as well as telling events in a different order. Scholars are divided on whether it is based on Ezra\u2013Nehemiah, or reflects an earlier literary stage before the combination of Ezra and Nehemiah accounts.\n\n===Josephus===\nThe first-century Jewish historian [[Josephus]] deals with Ezra in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]''. He uses the name Xerxes for Artaxerxes I reserving the name Artaxerxes for the later Artaxerxes II whom he identifies as the Ahasuerus of Esther, thus placing Ezra before the events of the book of Esther.  Josephus's account of the deeds of Ezra derives  entirely from [[1 Esdras]], which he cites as the 'Book of Ezra' in his numeration of the Hebrew bible.  Contrariwise, Josephus does not appear to recognise Ezra-Nehemiah as a biblical book, does not quote from it, and relies entirely on other traditions in his account of the deeds of [[Nehemiah]].\n\n===The apocalyptic Ezra traditions===\nThe [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] [[2 Esdras|fourth book of Ezra]] (also sometimes called the 'second book of Esdras' or the 'third book of Esdras') was written c. CE 100, probably in [[Judeo-Aramaic language|Hebrew-Aramaic]], but now survives in Latin, Slavonic and Ethiopic. It was one of the most important sources for [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish theology]] at the end of the 1st century.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} In this book, Ezra has a seven part prophetic revelation, converses with an [[angel]] of God three times and has four visions.

Another tradition locates his tomb near Basra, Iraq.\n\n==Ezra in Christian traditions==\nEarly Christian writers occasionally cited Ezra as author of the apocalyptic books attributed to him. [[Clement of Alexandria]] in his ''[[Stromata]]'' referred to Ezra as an example of prophetic inspiration, quoting a section from [[2 Esdras]]. Where early Christian writers refer to the 'Book of Ezra' it is always the text of [[1 Esdras]] that is being cited.

Randi becomes a recurring guest on ''[[The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson]]'', and makes appearances on TV shows such as ''[[Happy Days]]'' and in rock music artist [[Alice Cooper]]'s 1973 ''[[Billion Dollar Babies]]'' tour, where Randi decapitates Cooper at the end of each performance.\n\nThe film spotlights some of the more notable targets investigated and debunked by Randi. One is mentalist [[Uri Geller]], who performed [[psychic]] feats on the talk show circuit, such as bending a spoon with minimal contact, and guessing the contents of sealed envelopes and other objects. Randi worked closely with the staff of ''The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'' prior to a 1973 appearance on that program by Geller, who publicly claimed at the time that his acts were performed with genuine psychic ability, and not magic tricks. Randi had ''The Tonight Show'' staff observe strict [[Scientific control|controls]] over the materials that Geller would work with during his appearance to prevent any trickery or cheating by Geller. As a result, Geller was unable to perform any of the feats that he regularly performed on other TV shows. Another target is faith healer [[Peter Popoff]], who during his church revival meetings, demonstrated personal knowledge of people in the audience, such as their names, addresses and illnesses, which he stated was due to the work of God. Randi discovered that the true source of this information was a radio in Popoff's ear with which he was fed information by his wife. Another venture on which Randi embarked had him perpetrating a hoax on the Australian public in which a young man claimed on Australian television to channel the spirit of an ancient seer. The man was in reality Randi's partner, performance artist Jos\u00e9 Alvarez. In another, Randi had two confederates, mentalist [[Banachek|Steve Shaw]] and actor Michael Edwards, [[Project Alpha|pose as mentalists]] in a Washington University in St. Louis study that mistakenly confirmed Geller as an actual psychic.\n\nThe film also details Randi's longtime relationship with Alvarez, his decision to publicly [[coming out|come out]] at age 81, and how Alvarez, at the time of filming, had recently been discovered to be living under a false identity, which leads to legal ramifications for the couple.\n\n==Production==\nIn 2012 producers Tyler Measom and Justin Weinstein visited James Randi at his home in [[Plantation, Florida]] to express interest in filming a documentary about his life. To illustrate their bona fides to him, they gave him copies of their previous documentaries.
