In particular, samples sought will include those that have minerals deposited by water-related processes such as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[Water vapor|evaporation]], [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary cementation]] or [[hydrothermal activity]].\n* Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and soils surrounding the landing sites.\n* Determine what [[Geology of Mars|geologic processes]] have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry. Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering.\n* Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] instruments. This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey [[Geology of Mars|Martian geology]] from orbit.\n* Search for iron-containing minerals, identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates.\n* Characterize the [[mineralogy]] and textures of rocks and soils and determine the processes that created them.\n* Search for geological clues to the [[Environmental science|environmental conditions]] that existed when liquid water was present.\n* Assess whether those environments were conducive to life.\n\nNASA sought evidence of life on Mars, beginning with the question of whether the Martian environment was ever suitable for life. Life forms known to science require water, so the history of [[water on Mars]] is a critical piece of knowledge.

It was the highest resolution image taken on the surface of another planet. According to the camera designer Jim Bell of [[Cornell University]], the panoramic mosaic consists of four pancam images high by three wide. The picture shown originally had a full size of 4,000 by 3,000 [[pixels]]. However, a complete pancam panorama is even 8 times larger than that, and could be taken in stereo (i.e., two complete pictures, making the resolution twice as large again.) The colors are fairly accurate. (For a technical explanation, see [http://areo.info/mer/ colors outside the range of the human eye].)\n\nThe MER pancams are black-and-white instruments.

The next day the rover radioed a 7.8 bit/s beep, confirming that it had received a transmission from Earth but indicating that the craft believed it was in a fault mode. Commands would only be responded to intermittently. This was described as a very serious anomaly, but potentially recoverable if it were a software or memory corruption issue rather than a serious hardware failure. ''Spirit'' was commanded to transmit engineering data, and on January 23 sent several short low-bitrate messages before finally transmitting 73 megabits via [[X band]] to ''[[Mars Odyssey]]''. The readings from the engineering data suggested that the rover was not staying in sleep mode. As such, it was wasting its battery energy and overheating \u2013 risk factors that could potentially destroy the rover if not fixed soon. On sol 20, the command team sent it the command SHUTDWN_DMT_TIL (\"Shutdown Dammit Until\") to try to cause it to suspend itself until a given time. It seemingly ignored the command.\n\nThe leading theory at the time was that the rover was stuck in a \"reboot loop\". The rover was programmed to reboot if there was a fault aboard. However, if there was a fault that occurred during reboot, it would continue to reboot forever. The fact that the problem persisted through reboot suggested that the error was not in RAM, but in either the [[flash memory]], the [[EEPROM]], or a hardware fault. The last case would likely doom the rover. Anticipating the potential for errors in the flash memory and EEPROM, the designers had made it so that the rover could be booted without ever touching the flash memory. The radio itself could decode a limited command set \u2013 enough to tell the rover to reboot without using flash. Without access to flash memory the reboot cycle was broken.\n\nOn January 24, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|24}}) the rover repair team announced that the problem was with ''Spirit'''s flash memory and the software that wrote to it. The flash hardware was believed to be working correctly but the file management module in the software was \"not robust enough\" for the operations the ''Spirit'' was engaged in when the problem occurred, indicating that the problem was caused by a software bug as opposed to faulty hardware. NASA engineers finally came to the conclusion that there were too many files on the file system, which was a relatively minor problem. Most of these files contained unneeded in-flight data. After realizing what the problem was, the engineers deleted some files, and eventually reformatted the entire flash memory system. On February 6 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|02|06}}), the rover was restored to its original working condition, and science activities resumed.<ref name=\"planetary\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719212649/http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000702/ Planetary Blog].</ref>\n\n==== First intentional grinding of a rock on Mars ====\n[[File:Rat post grind.jpg|thumb|right|Digital camera (the [[Pancam]]) image of a Mars rock (called [[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]) taken after a [[Rock Abrasion Tool|RAT]] grind (the rock grinding tool)]]\nFor the first intentional grinding of a rock on Mars, the ''Spirit'' team chose a rock called \"[[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]\". To make the drive there, the rover turned 40 degrees in short arcs totaling {{convert|95|cm}}. It then turned in place to face the target rock and drove four short moves straightforward totaling {{cvt|1.9|m}}. Adirondack was chosen over another rock called \"Sashimi\", which was closer to the rover, as Adirondack's surface was smoother, making it more suitable for the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (aka \"RAT\").<ref>{{cite press release |last=Webster |first=Guy |date=January 19, 2004 |title=Spirit Drives to a Rock Called 'Adirondack' for Close Inspection |url=https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20040119a.html |publisher=NASA |access-date=2018-01-02}}</ref>\n\n''Spirit'' made a small depression in the rock, {{convert|45.5|mm}} in diameter and {{convert|2.65|mm}} deep.

Raymond Arvidson, the McDonnell University Professor and chair of Earth and Planetary Sciences at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], reported during a NASA press conference: \"If we found this rock on Earth, we would say it is a volcanic rock that had a little fluid moving through it.\" In contrast to the rocks found by the twin rover ''Opportunity'', this one was formed from [[magma]] and then acquired bright material in small crevices, which look like crystallized minerals. If this interpretation holds true, the minerals were most likely dissolved in water, which was either carried inside the rock or interacted with it at a later stage, after it formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040305a.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Bonneville crater ====\nOn sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|03|11}} March 11, 2004, ''Spirit'' reached [[Bonneville (crater)|Bonneville crater]] after a {{convert|400|yd|m|adj=on|sp=us}} journey.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} This crater is about {{convert|200|m|yd|sp=us}} across with a floor about {{convert|10|m|yd|sp=us}} [[Crater depth|below]] the surface.<ref>{{cite web |title=Surfical geology of the Spirit rover traverse in Gusev Crater: dry and desiccating since the Hesperian |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/earlymars2004/pdf/8055.pdf |conference=Second Conference on Early Mars (2004) |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |author=Golombek|page=1 |quote=The rim is ~{{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} high and although the crater is shallow (~{{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us}} deep)|display-authors=etal}}</ref> JPL decided that it would be a bad idea to send the rover down into the crater, as they saw no targets of interest inside. ''Spirit'' drove along the southern rim and continued to the southwest towards the Columbia Hills.\n{{wide image|PIA05591 Spirit's Destination (panorama).jpg|800px|Bonneville Crater}}\n\n''Spirit'' reached Missoula crater on sol 105. The crater is roughly {{convert|100|yd|m|sp=us}} across and {{convert|20|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. Missoula crater was not considered a high priority target due to the older rocks it contained. The rover skirted the northern rim, and continued to the southeast.\nIt then reached Lahontan crater on sol 118, and drove along the rim until sol 120. Lahontan is about {{convert|60|yd|m|sp=us}} across and about {{convert|10|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. A long, snaking sand dune stretches away from its southwestern side, and ''Spirit'' went around it, because loose sand dunes present an unknown risk to the ability of the rover wheels to get traction.\n\n==== Columbia Hills ====\n''Spirit'' drove from Bonneville crater in a direct line to the Columbia Hills. The route was only directly controlled by the engineers when the terrain was difficult to navigate; otherwise, the rover drove in an autonomous mode. On sol 159, ''Spirit'' reached the first of many targets at the base of the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]] called West Spur. Hank's Hollow was studied for 23 sols. Within Hank's Hollow was the strange-looking rock dubbed \"[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold]]\". Analysing this rock was difficult for Spirit, because it lay in a slippery area. After a detailed analysis with the AXPS-and the M\u00f6\u00dfbauer instrument it was detected that it contains hematite.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2004-161 | title = Mars Rovers Surprises Continue | work = JPL website | accessdate = 2006-10-06}}</ref> This kind of rock can  be built in connection with water.\n\nAs the produced energy from the solar panels was lowering due to the setting sun and dust the Deep Sleep Mode was introduced. In this mode the rover was shut down completely during the night in order to save energy, even if the instruments would fail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2004.html#sol171|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> The route was selected so that the rover's panels were tilted as much as possible towards the winter sun.\n\nFrom here, ''Spirit'' took a northerly path along the base of the hill towards the target Wooly Patch, which was studied from sol 192 to sol 199. By sol 203, ''Spirit'' had driven southward up the hill and arrived at the rock dubbed \"Clovis\". Clovis was ground and analyzed from sol 210 to sol 225. Following Clovis came the targets of Ebenezer (Sols 226\u2013235), Tetl (sol 270), Uchben and Palinque (Sols 281\u2013295), and Lutefisk (Sols 296\u2013303). From Sols 239 to 262, ''Spirit'' powered down for [[solar conjunction]], when communications with the Earth are blocked. Slowly, ''Spirit'' made its way around the summit of Husband Hill, and at sol 344 was ready to climb over the newly designated \"Cumberland Ridge\" and into \"[[Larry's Lookout]]\" and \"Tennessee Valley\". ''Spirit'' also did some communication tests with the ESA orbiter ''[[Mars Express]]'' though most of the communication was usually done with the NASA orbiters ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]''.\n\n=== 2005 ===\n\n==== Driving up to Husband Hill ====\n''Spirit'' had now been on Mars for one Earth year and was driving slowly uphill towards the top of Husband Hill. This was difficult because there were many rocky obstacles and sandy parts. This lead frequently to a slippage and the route could not be driven as planned. In February ''Spirit'''s computer received a software update in order to drive more autonomously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol416|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> On sol 371, ''Spirit'' arrived at a rock named \"Peace\" near the top of Cumberland Ridge. ''Spirit'' ground ''Peace'' with the RAT on sol 373. By sol 390 (mid-February 2005), ''Spirit'' was advancing towards \"Larry's Lookout\", by driving up the hill in reverse. The scientists at this time were trying to conserve as much energy as possible for the climb.\n\n''Spirit'' also investigated some targets along the way, including the soil target, \"Paso Robles\", which contained the highest amount of salt found on the red planet. The soil also contained a high amount of [[phosphorus]] in its composition, however not nearly as high as another rock sampled by ''Spirit'', \"Wishstone\". Squyres said of the discovery, \"We're still trying to work out what this means, but clearly, with this much salt around, water had a hand here\".\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Pot of gold-Close-med.jpg|[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold rock]]\nImage:Gusev - Colina Husband.jpg|''Spirit'''s traverse up Husband Hill\nImage:Spirit PIA03230.jpg|''Spirit'' artificially added to image (taken by itself) of Larry's Lookout\nImage:MarsSunset.jpg|Martian sunset by ''Spirit'' at Gusev crater, May 19, 2005.\n</gallery>\n\n==== Dust devils ====\nOn March 9, 2005 (probably during the Martian night), the rover's solar panel efficiency jumped from the original ~60%  to 93%, followed on March 10, by the sighting of [[dust devils]]. NASA scientists speculate a dust devil must have swept the solar panels clean, possibly significantly extending the duration of the mission. This also marks the first time dust devils had been spotted by ''Spirit'' or ''Opportunity'', and is easily one of the top highlights of the mission to date. Dust devils had previously only been photographed by the ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'' probe.\n\nMission members monitoring ''Spirit'' on Mars reported on March 12, 2005 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2005|03|12}}), that a lucky encounter with a dust devil had cleaned the robot's solar panels. Energy levels dramatically increased and daily science work was anticipated to be expanded.<ref>{{cite web | last = David | first = Leonard | date = March 12, 2005 | url = http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/spirit_dust_050312.html | title = Spirit Gets A Dust Devil Once-Over | publisher = Space.com | accessdate =December 1, 2006}}</ref>\n \n[[File:Marsdustdevil2.gif|thumb|center|800px|Video of a dust devil on Mars, photographed by ''Spirit''.

Here it was found that Husband Hill has two summits, with one a little higher than the other. On September 29 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2005|08|21}})<ref>{{cite web |title=Rover Update: 2005: All |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/mer/mission/rover-status/spirit/2005/all/#sol579 |website=mars.nasa.gov |accessdate=23 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>, ''Spirit'' reached the real summit of Husband Hill. The rover was the first spacecraft to climb atop a mountain on another planet. The whole distance driven totaled 4971 meters.\nThe summit itself was flat. ''Spirit'' took a 360 degree panorama in real color, which included the whole Gusev crater. At night the rover observed the moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] in order to determine their orbits better.<ref name=\"nasa_2010_189\">{{cite web \n|authors=Staff |title=NASA Rover Finds Clue to Mars' Past And Environment for Life |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/news/mer20100603.html |work=[[NASA]] |date=2010-06-03 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> On sol 656 ''Spirit'' surveyed the Mars sky and the opacity of the atmosphere with its pancam to make a coordinated science campaign with the Hubble Space Telescope in Earth orbit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol655|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\nFrom the peak ''Spirit'' spotted a striking formation, which was dubbed \"Home Plate\". This was an interesting target, but ''Spirit'' would be driven later to the McCool Hill to tilt its solar panels towards the sun in the coming winter. At the end of October the rover was driven downhill and to Home Plate. On the way down ''Spirit'' reached the rock formation named \"Comanche\" on sol 690. Scientists used data from all three spectrometers to find out that about one-fourth of the composition of Comanche is magnesium iron carbonate. That concentration is 10 times higher than for any previously identified carbonate in a Martian rock. Carbonates originate in wet, near-neutral conditions but dissolve in acid. The find at Comanche is the first unambiguous evidence from the Mars Exploration Mission rovers for a past Martian environment that may have been more favorable to life than the wet but acidic conditions indicated by the rovers' earlier finds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/multimedia/gallery/comanche-no-label.html|title=NASA \u2013 Carbonate-Containing Martian Rocks (False Color)|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n{{Wide image|Everest Panorama from Mars.jpg|1100px|View from the Summit taken by ''Spirit'' on August 23, 2005, as the rover completed the climb up Husband Hill.}}\n\n=== 2006 ===\n\n==== Driving to McCool Hill ====\nIn 2006 ''Spirit'' drove towards an area dubbed Home Plate, and reached it in February. For events in 2006 by NASA see [http://marsrover.nasa.gov/mission/status_spirit_2006.html NASA Spirit Archive 2006]\n\n''Spirit's'' next stop was originally planned to be the north face of [[McCool Hill]], where ''Spirit'' would receive adequate sunlight during the Martian winter. On March 16, 2006 JPL announced that ''Spirit's'' troublesome front wheel had stopped working altogether. Despite this, ''Spirit'' was still making progress toward McCool Hill because the control team programmed the rover to drive toward McCool Hill backwards, dragging its broken wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll.html#sol778|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>  In late March, ''Spirit'' encountered loose soil that was impeding its progress toward McCool Hill. A decision was made to terminate attempts to reach McCool Hill and instead park on a nearby ridge named Low Ridge Haven.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right \n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Home plate anim.gif\n| width1    = {{#expr: (130 * 331 / 285 ) round 0}}\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = Curious rock near edge of \"Home Plate\" with a jutting portion.

The rover made its first drive, a short turn to position targets of interest within reach of the robotic arm, in early November 2006, following the shortest days of winter and solar conjunction when communications with Earth were severely limited.\n\nWhile at Low Ridge, ''Spirit'' imaged two rocks of similar chemical nature to that of ''Opportunity'''s [[Heat Shield Rock]], a [[meteorite]] on the surface of Mars. Named \"Zhong Shan\" for [[Sun Yat-sen]] and \"Allan Hills\" for the [[Allan Hills|location]] in [[Antarctica]] where several Martian meteorites have been found, they stood out against the background rocks that were darker. Further spectrographic testing is being done to determine the exact composition of these rocks, which may turn out to also be meteorites.\n\n=== 2007 ===\n\n==== Software upgrade ====\nOn January 4, 2007 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2007|01|04}}), both rovers received new flight software to the onboard computers. The update was received just in time for the third anniversary of their landing. The new systems let the rovers decide whether or not to transmit an image, and whether or not to extend their arms to examine rocks, which would save much time for scientists as they would not have to sift through hundreds of images to find the one they want, or examine the surroundings to decide to extend the arms and examine the rocks.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/01/04/tech-mars.html | work=CBC News | title=Old rovers learn new tricks | date=January 4, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Silica Valley====\n[[File:Spirit Mars Silica April 20 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rover exposes silica-rich dust]]\n''Spirit'''s dead wheel turned out to have a silver lining. As it was traveling in March 2007, pulling the dead wheel behind, the wheel scraped off the upper layer of the Martian soil, uncovering a patch of ground that scientists say shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life. It is similar to areas on Earth where water or steam from hot springs came into contact with volcanic rocks. On Earth, these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria, said rover chief scientist [[Steve Squyres]]. \"We're really excited about this,\" he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The area is extremely rich in [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]\u2013the main ingredient of window glass. The researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways. One: hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolved silica at one location and then carried it to another (i.e. a geyser). Two: acidic steam rising through cracks in rocks  stripped them of their mineral components, leaving silica behind. \"The important thing is that whether it is one hypothesis or the other, the implications for the former habitability of Mars are pretty much the same,\" Squyres explained to BBC News. Hot water provides an environment in which [[microbe]]s can thrive and the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them. Squyres added, \"You can go to [[hot spring]]s and you can go to [[fumarole]]s and at either place on Earth it is teeming with life \u2013 [[Microorganism|microbial life]].\"<ref name=\"Amos\">{{cite news  | last = Amos  | first = Jonathan    | title = Mars robot unearths microbe clue   | work = NASA says its robot rover Spirit has made one of its most significant discoveries on the surface of Mars. |publisher=BBC News  | date = December 11, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7137793.stm  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"20071210a\">{{cite web  | last = Bertster  | first =  Guy   | title = Mars Rover Investigates Signs of Steamy Martian Past  | work = Press Release  | publisher = Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California  | date = December 10, 2007  | url = http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20071210a.html  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==== Global dust storm and Home Plate ====\nDuring 2007 ''Spirit'' spent several months near the base of the Home Plate plateau. On sol 1306 ''Spirit'' climbed onto the eastern edge of the plateau. In September and October it examined rocks and soils at several locations on the southern half of the plateau. On November 6, ''Spirit'' had reached the western edge of Home Plate, and started taking pictures for a panoramic overview of the western valley, with Grissom Hill and Husband Hill visible. The panorama image was published on NASA's website on January 3, 2008 to little attention, until January 23, when an independent website published a magnified detail of the image that showed a rock feature a few centimeters high resembling a humanoid figure seen from the side with its right arm partially raised.<ref>[http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001305/ Planetary.org] Emily Lakdawalla, ''Teeny little Bigfoot on Mars'', January 23, 2008 | 12:41 PST | 20:41 UTC</ref><ref>{{Cite APOD |date=January 29, 2008 |title=Spirit's West Valley Panorama image |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mars Spirit rover's solar panels covered with Dust - October 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Circular projection showing ''Spirit'''s solar panels covered in dust \u2013 October 2007]]\nTowards the end of June 2007, a series of dust storms began clouding the Martian atmosphere with dust. The storms intensified and by July 20, both ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' were facing the real possibility of system failure due to lack of energy. NASA released a statement to the press that said (in part) \"We're rooting for our rovers to survive these storms, but they were never designed for conditions this intense\".<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-080| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=NASA Mars Rovers Braving Severe Dust Storms| date=July 27, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> The key problem caused by the dust storms was a dramatic reduction in solar energy caused by there being so much dust in the atmosphere that it was blocking 99 percent of direct sunlight to ''Opportunity'', and slightly more to ''Spirit''.\n\nNormally the solar arrays on the rovers are able to generate up to {{Convert|700|Wh}} of energy per [[Martian day]]. After the storms, the amount of energy generated was greatly reduced to {{Convert|128|Wh}}. If the rovers generate less than {{Convert|150|Wh}} per day they must start draining their batteries to run survival heaters. If the batteries run dry, key electrical elements are likely to fail due to the intense cold. Both rovers were put into the lowest-power setting in order to wait out the storms. In early August the storms began to clear slightly, allowing the rovers to successfully charge their batteries. They were kept in hibernation in order to wait out the remainder of the storm.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20070807a.html| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=Martian Skies Brighten Slightly| date=August 7, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref>\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n==== Hibernating ====\nThe main concern was the energy level for ''Spirit''. To increase the amount of light hitting the solar panels, the rover was parked in the northern part of Home Plate on as steep a slope as possible. It was expected that the level of dust cover on the solar panels would increase by 70 percent and that a slope of 30 degrees would be necessary to survive the winter. In February, a tilt of 29.9 degrees was achieved. Extra energy was available at times, and a high definition panorama named ''Bonestell'' was produced. At other times when there was only enough solar energy to recharge the batteries, communication with Earth was minimized and all unnecessary instruments were switched off. At winter solstice the energy production declined to 235 watt hours per sol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2008.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Winter dust storm ====\nOn November 10, 2008, a large dust storm further reduced the output of the solar panels to {{Convert|89|Wh}} per day\u2014a critically low level.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20081110a.html |accessdate=August 21, 2009|title=Dust Storm Cuts Energy Supply of NASA Mars Rover Spirit| date= November 10, 2008| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> NASA officials were hopeful that ''Spirit'' would survive the storm, and that the energy level would rise once the storm had passed and the skies started clearing.

It is also possible that the rover had experienced a mission clock fault. If that had happened, the rover would have lost track of time and tried to remain asleep until enough sunlight struck the solar arrays to wake it. This state is called \"Solar Groovy.\" If the rover woke up from a mission clock fault, it would only listen. Starting on July 26, 2010 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2010|07|26}}), a new procedure to address the possible mission clock fault was implemented.\n\nEach sol, the Deep Space Network mission controllers sent a set of X-band \"Sweep & Beep\" commands. If the rover had experienced a mission clock fault and then had been awoken during the day, it would have listened during brief, 20-minute intervals during each hour awake. Due to the possible clock fault, the timing of these 20-minute listening intervals was not known, so multiple \"Sweep & Beep\" commands were sent. If the rover heard one of these commands, it would have responded with an X-band beep signal, updating the mission controllers on its status and allowing them to investigate the state of the rover further.

Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form.\nOne type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, [[phosphorus]], [[calcium]], and iron.<ref name=\"Ming2005JE002560\" />\nAlso, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe<sup>3+</sup> form, which would happen if water had been present.<ref name=\"Bell\" />\n\nTowards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure [[silica]] were found in the soil.<ref name=\"Sky & Telescope\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/19177609.html|title=Mars Rover Uncovers Ancient Hot Springs|publisher=SkyandTelescope.com|date=2008-05-22|accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>  The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20070521.html|title=NASA \u2013 Mars Rover Spirit Unearths Surprise Evidence of Wetter Past|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Spirit'' stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or [[Mini-TES]] and confirmed the presence of large amounts of [[carbonate]]-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water. The carbonates were discovered in an outcrop of rocks called \"Comanche.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/06/100603140959.htm|title=Outcrop of long-sought rare rock on Mars found}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1189667 | title = Identification of Carbonate-Rich Outcrops on Mars by the Spirit Rover | year = 2010 | last1 = Morris | first1 = R.

However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates that only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component that was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.\n\n==Astronomy==\n{{see also|Astronomy on Mars}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = PIA05547-Spirit Rover-Earth seen from Mars.png\n| width1 = {{#expr: (200 * (1194 / 1007)) round 0}}\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Earth]] from Mars\n| image2 = Phobos & Deimos full thumb.png\n| width2 = {{#expr: (200 * (200 / 213)) round 0}}\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Night sky of Mars showing [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] (left) and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] (right) in front of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], as seen by [[Mars Exploration Rover]] ''Spirit'' on August 26, 2005.

It also took the first photo of Earth from the surface of another planet in early March 2004.\n\nIn late 2005, ''Spirit'' took advantage of a favorable energy situation to make multiple nighttime observations of both of Mars' moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]].<ref name=\"pancam\">Jim Bell (Cornell University) et al. [http://pancam.astro.cornell.edu/pancam_instrument/projects_2.html Pancam Projects: Spirit Night-time Imaging]. Retrieved 2008-10-21</ref> These observations included a \"[[lunar eclipse|lunar]]\" (or rather phobian) [[eclipse]] as ''Spirit'' watched Phobos disappear into Mars' shadow. Some of ''Spirit'''s star gazing was designed to look for a predicted [[meteor shower]] caused by [[Halley's Comet]], and although at least four imaged streaks were suspect meteors, they could not be unambiguously differentiated from those caused by cosmic rays.<ref name=\"pancam\" />\n\nA [[transit of Mercury from Mars]] took place on January 12, 2005 from about 14:45 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] to 23:05 UTC. Theoretically, this could have been observed by both ''Spirit'' and ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]''; however, camera resolution did not permit seeing Mercury's [[Arc second|6.1\"]] angular diameter. They were able to observe transits of [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] across the Sun, but at [[Arc minute|2']] angular diameter, Deimos is about 20 times larger than Mercury's 6.1\" angular diameter. Ephemeris data generated by [[JPL Horizons]] indicates that ''Opportunity'' would have been able to observe the transit from the start until local sunset at about 19:23 UTC Earth time, while ''Spirit'' would have been able to observe it from local sunrise at about 19:38 UTC until the end of the transit.{{Clarify|date=October 2008}}<!-- the nasa.gov URL does not state any of this; need instructions on how to verify this --><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons|title=HORIZONS System|first=Alan|last=Chamberlin|website=ssd.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment wear and failures==\nBoth rovers passed their original mission time of 90 sols many times over. The extended time on the surface, and therefore additional stress on components, resulted in some issues developing.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/>\n\nOn March 13, 2006 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2006|03|13}}), the right front wheel ceased working<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-b.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/mer/images.cfm/images.cfm?id=1906|title=JPL.NASA.GOV: Mars Exploration Rovers|website=www-b.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> after having covered {{Convert|4.2|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} on Mars. Engineers began driving the rover backwards, dragging the dead wheel. Although this resulted in changes to driving techniques, the dragging effect became a useful tool, partially clearing away soil on the surface as the rover traveled, thus allowing areas to be imaged that would normally be inaccessible. However, in mid-December 2009, to the surprise of the engineers, the right front wheel showed slight movement in a wheel-test on sol 2113 and clearly rotated with normal resistance on three of four wheel-tests on sol 2117, but stalled on the fourth. On November 29, 2009 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2009|11|29}}), the right rear wheel also stalled and remained inoperable for the remainder of the mission.\n\nScientific instruments also experienced degradation as a result of exposure to the harsh Martian environment and use over a far longer period than had been anticipated by the mission planners. Over time, the diamond in the resin grinding surface of the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] wore down, after that the device could only be used to brush targets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/rover/Roverextension.html|title=NASA\u02bcs Mars rovers and Steve Squyres keep going and going \u2013 Cornell Chronicle|website=www.news.cornell.edu}}</ref> All of the other science instruments and engineering cameras continued to function until contact was lost; however, towards the end of ''Spirit'''s life, the [[MIMOS II]] [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectrometer]] took much longer to produce results than it did earlier in the mission because of the decay of its [[cobalt]]-57 gamma ray source that has a half life of 271 days.\n\n==Honors==\n[[File:MarsSunsetCut.jpg|thumb|right|Martian sunset in 2005 by ''Spirit'']]\n\n===To rover===\nTo commemorate ''Spirit'''s great contribution to the [[exploration of Mars]], the [[asteroid]]  [[37452 Spirit]] has been named after it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/spotlight/20041011.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: Spotlight|website=marsrovers.nasa.gov}}</ref> The name was proposed by [[Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld]] who along with [[Cornelis Johannes van Houten]] and [[Tom Gehrels]] discovered the asteroid on September 24, 1960.\n\n[[Reuben H.

The mission received several extensions and lasted about 2,208 sols. On August 11, 2007, ''Spirit'' obtained the second longest operational duration on the surface of Mars for a lander or rover at 1282 Sols, one sol longer than the [[Viking 2]] lander. Viking 2 was powered by a nuclear cell whereas ''Spirit'' is powered by solar arrays. Until ''Opportunity'' overtook it on May 19, 2010, the Mars probe with longest operational period was [[Viking 1]] that lasted for 2245 Sols on the surface of Mars. On March 22, 2010, ''Spirit'' sent its last communication, thus falling just over a month short of surpassing Viking 1's operational record.

In particular, samples sought will include those that have minerals deposited by water-related processes such as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[Water vapor|evaporation]], [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary cementation]] or [[hydrothermal activity]].\n* Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and soils surrounding the landing sites.\n* Determine what [[Geology of Mars|geologic processes]] have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry. Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering.\n* Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] instruments. This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey [[Geology of Mars|Martian geology]] from orbit.\n* Search for iron-containing minerals, identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates.\n* Characterize the [[mineralogy]] and textures of rocks and soils and determine the processes that created them.\n* Search for geological clues to the [[Environmental science|environmental conditions]] that existed when liquid water was present.\n* Assess whether those environments were conducive to life.\n\nNASA sought evidence of life on Mars, beginning with the question of whether the Martian environment was ever suitable for life. Life forms known to science require water, so the history of [[water on Mars]] is a critical piece of knowledge. Although the Mars Exploration Rovers did not have the ability to detect life directly, they offered very important information on the habitability of the environment during the planet's history.\n\n==Design and construction==\n\n[[File:Mars Exploration Rover.jpg|thumb|right|Annotated rover diagram]]\n[[File:MER Spirit Lander Pan Sol16-A18R1 br2.jpg|thumb|right|''Spirit'' rover images its lander on the surface of Mars on January 18/19, 2004 (''Spirit'' Sol 16)<ref>[http://marsrover.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20040121a.html NASA.gov], MER-A 20040121a</ref>]]\n[[File:Spirit rock abrasion tool.jpg|thumb|The piece of metal with the American flag on Spirit's rock abrasion tool is made of aluminum recovered from the site of the World Trade Center towers.]]\n{{main|Mars Exploration Rover}}\n{{see also|Comparison of embedded computer systems on board the Mars rovers}}\n\n''Spirit'' (and its twin, ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]'') are six-wheeled, [[solar panel|solar-powered]] robots standing {{convert|1.5|m|ft|sp=us}} high, {{convert|2.3|m|ft|sp=us}} wide and {{convert|1.6|m|ft|sp=us}} long and weighing {{convert|180|kg|lb}}.

It was the highest resolution image taken on the surface of another planet. According to the camera designer Jim Bell of [[Cornell University]], the panoramic mosaic consists of four pancam images high by three wide. The picture shown originally had a full size of 4,000 by 3,000 [[pixels]]. However, a complete pancam panorama is even 8 times larger than that, and could be taken in stereo (i.e., two complete pictures, making the resolution twice as large again.) The colors are fairly accurate. (For a technical explanation, see [http://areo.info/mer/ colors outside the range of the human eye].)\n\nThe MER pancams are black-and-white instruments. Thirteen rotating filter wheels produce multiple images of the same scene at different wavelengths. Once received on Earth, these images can be combined to produce color images.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/methods.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424065044/http://www.lyle.org/~markoff/methods.html|url-status=dead|title=MER color imagery, methods|archivedate=April 24, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==== Sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|21}} flash memory management anomaly ====\nOn January 21, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|21}}), ''Spirit'' abruptly ceased communicating with mission control. The next day the rover radioed a 7.8 bit/s beep, confirming that it had received a transmission from Earth but indicating that the craft believed it was in a fault mode. Commands would only be responded to intermittently. This was described as a very serious anomaly, but potentially recoverable if it were a software or memory corruption issue rather than a serious hardware failure. ''Spirit'' was commanded to transmit engineering data, and on January 23 sent several short low-bitrate messages before finally transmitting 73 megabits via [[X band]] to ''[[Mars Odyssey]]''. The readings from the engineering data suggested that the rover was not staying in sleep mode. As such, it was wasting its battery energy and overheating \u2013 risk factors that could potentially destroy the rover if not fixed soon. On sol 20, the command team sent it the command SHUTDWN_DMT_TIL (\"Shutdown Dammit Until\") to try to cause it to suspend itself until a given time. It seemingly ignored the command.\n\nThe leading theory at the time was that the rover was stuck in a \"reboot loop\". The rover was programmed to reboot if there was a fault aboard. However, if there was a fault that occurred during reboot, it would continue to reboot forever. The fact that the problem persisted through reboot suggested that the error was not in RAM, but in either the [[flash memory]], the [[EEPROM]], or a hardware fault. The last case would likely doom the rover. Anticipating the potential for errors in the flash memory and EEPROM, the designers had made it so that the rover could be booted without ever touching the flash memory. The radio itself could decode a limited command set \u2013 enough to tell the rover to reboot without using flash. Without access to flash memory the reboot cycle was broken.\n\nOn January 24, 2004 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|01|24}}) the rover repair team announced that the problem was with ''Spirit'''s flash memory and the software that wrote to it. The flash hardware was believed to be working correctly but the file management module in the software was \"not robust enough\" for the operations the ''Spirit'' was engaged in when the problem occurred, indicating that the problem was caused by a software bug as opposed to faulty hardware. NASA engineers finally came to the conclusion that there were too many files on the file system, which was a relatively minor problem. Most of these files contained unneeded in-flight data. After realizing what the problem was, the engineers deleted some files, and eventually reformatted the entire flash memory system. On February 6 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|02|06}}), the rover was restored to its original working condition, and science activities resumed.<ref name=\"planetary\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719212649/http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000702/ Planetary Blog].</ref>\n\n==== First intentional grinding of a rock on Mars ====\n[[File:Rat post grind.jpg|thumb|right|Digital camera (the [[Pancam]]) image of a Mars rock (called [[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]) taken after a [[Rock Abrasion Tool|RAT]] grind (the rock grinding tool)]]\nFor the first intentional grinding of a rock on Mars, the ''Spirit'' team chose a rock called \"[[Adirondack (Mars)|Adirondack]]\". To make the drive there, the rover turned 40 degrees in short arcs totaling {{convert|95|cm}}. It then turned in place to face the target rock and drove four short moves straightforward totaling {{cvt|1.9|m}}. Adirondack was chosen over another rock called \"Sashimi\", which was closer to the rover, as Adirondack's surface was smoother, making it more suitable for the [[Rock Abrasion Tool]] (aka \"RAT\").<ref>{{cite press release |last=Webster |first=Guy |date=January 19, 2004 |title=Spirit Drives to a Rock Called 'Adirondack' for Close Inspection |url=https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20040119a.html |publisher=NASA |access-date=2018-01-02}}</ref>\n\n''Spirit'' made a small depression in the rock, {{convert|45.5|mm}} in diameter and {{convert|2.65|mm}} deep.

Raymond Arvidson, the McDonnell University Professor and chair of Earth and Planetary Sciences at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], reported during a NASA press conference: \"If we found this rock on Earth, we would say it is a volcanic rock that had a little fluid moving through it.\" In contrast to the rocks found by the twin rover ''Opportunity'', this one was formed from [[magma]] and then acquired bright material in small crevices, which look like crystallized minerals. If this interpretation holds true, the minerals were most likely dissolved in water, which was either carried inside the rock or interacted with it at a later stage, after it formed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20040305a.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Bonneville crater ====\nOn sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|03|11}} March 11, 2004, ''Spirit'' reached [[Bonneville (crater)|Bonneville crater]] after a {{convert|400|yd|m|adj=on|sp=us}} journey.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} This crater is about {{convert|200|m|yd|sp=us}} across with a floor about {{convert|10|m|yd|sp=us}} [[Crater depth|below]] the surface.<ref>{{cite web |title=Surfical geology of the Spirit rover traverse in Gusev Crater: dry and desiccating since the Hesperian |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/earlymars2004/pdf/8055.pdf |conference=Second Conference on Early Mars (2004) |accessdate=January 26, 2009 |author=Golombek|page=1 |quote=The rim is ~{{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} high and although the crater is shallow (~{{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us}} deep)|display-authors=etal}}</ref> JPL decided that it would be a bad idea to send the rover down into the crater, as they saw no targets of interest inside. ''Spirit'' drove along the southern rim and continued to the southwest towards the Columbia Hills.\n{{wide image|PIA05591 Spirit's Destination (panorama).jpg|800px|Bonneville Crater}}\n\n''Spirit'' reached Missoula crater on sol 105. The crater is roughly {{convert|100|yd|m|sp=us}} across and {{convert|20|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. Missoula crater was not considered a high priority target due to the older rocks it contained. The rover skirted the northern rim, and continued to the southeast.\nIt then reached Lahontan crater on sol 118, and drove along the rim until sol 120. Lahontan is about {{convert|60|yd|m|sp=us}} across and about {{convert|10|yd|m|sp=us}} deep. A long, snaking sand dune stretches away from its southwestern side, and ''Spirit'' went around it, because loose sand dunes present an unknown risk to the ability of the rover wheels to get traction.\n\n==== Columbia Hills ====\n''Spirit'' drove from Bonneville crater in a direct line to the Columbia Hills. The route was only directly controlled by the engineers when the terrain was difficult to navigate; otherwise, the rover drove in an autonomous mode. On sol 159, ''Spirit'' reached the first of many targets at the base of the [[Columbia Hills (Mars)|Columbia Hills]] called West Spur. Hank's Hollow was studied for 23 sols. Within Hank's Hollow was the strange-looking rock dubbed \"[[Pot of Gold (Mars)|Pot of Gold]]\". Analysing this rock was difficult for Spirit, because it lay in a slippery area. After a detailed analysis with the AXPS-and the M\u00f6\u00dfbauer instrument it was detected that it contains hematite.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2004-161 | title = Mars Rovers Surprises Continue | work = JPL website | accessdate = 2006-10-06}}</ref> This kind of rock can  be built in connection with water.\n\nAs the produced energy from the solar panels was lowering due to the setting sun and dust the Deep Sleep Mode was introduced. In this mode the rover was shut down completely during the night in order to save energy, even if the instruments would fail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2004.html#sol171|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> The route was selected so that the rover's panels were tilted as much as possible towards the winter sun.\n\nFrom here, ''Spirit'' took a northerly path along the base of the hill towards the target Wooly Patch, which was studied from sol 192 to sol 199. By sol 203, ''Spirit'' had driven southward up the hill and arrived at the rock dubbed \"Clovis\". Clovis was ground and analyzed from sol 210 to sol 225. Following Clovis came the targets of Ebenezer (Sols 226\u2013235), Tetl (sol 270), Uchben and Palinque (Sols 281\u2013295), and Lutefisk (Sols 296\u2013303). From Sols 239 to 262, ''Spirit'' powered down for [[solar conjunction]], when communications with the Earth are blocked. Slowly, ''Spirit'' made its way around the summit of Husband Hill, and at sol 344 was ready to climb over the newly designated \"Cumberland Ridge\" and into \"[[Larry's Lookout]]\" and \"Tennessee Valley\". ''Spirit'' also did some communication tests with the ESA orbiter ''[[Mars Express]]'' though most of the communication was usually done with the NASA orbiters ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]''.\n\n=== 2005 ===\n\n==== Driving up to Husband Hill ====\n''Spirit'' had now been on Mars for one Earth year and was driving slowly uphill towards the top of Husband Hill. This was difficult because there were many rocky obstacles and sandy parts. This lead frequently to a slippage and the route could not be driven as planned. In February ''Spirit'''s computer received a software update in order to drive more autonomously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol416|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> On sol 371, ''Spirit'' arrived at a rock named \"Peace\" near the top of Cumberland Ridge. ''Spirit'' ground ''Peace'' with the RAT on sol 373. By sol 390 (mid-February 2005), ''Spirit'' was advancing towards \"Larry's Lookout\", by driving up the hill in reverse. The scientists at this time were trying to conserve as much energy as possible for the climb.\n\n''Spirit'' also investigated some targets along the way, including the soil target, \"Paso Robles\", which contained the highest amount of salt found on the red planet. The soil also contained a high amount of [[phosphorus]] in its composition, however not nearly as high as another rock sampled by ''Spirit'', \"Wishstone\".

NASA scientists speculate a dust devil must have swept the solar panels clean, possibly significantly extending the duration of the mission. This also marks the first time dust devils had been spotted by ''Spirit'' or ''Opportunity'', and is easily one of the top highlights of the mission to date. Dust devils had previously only been photographed by the ''[[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'' probe.\n\nMission members monitoring ''Spirit'' on Mars reported on March 12, 2005 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2005|03|12}}), that a lucky encounter with a dust devil had cleaned the robot's solar panels. Energy levels dramatically increased and daily science work was anticipated to be expanded.<ref>{{cite web | last = David | first = Leonard | date = March 12, 2005 | url = http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/spirit_dust_050312.html | title = Spirit Gets A Dust Devil Once-Over | publisher = Space.com | accessdate =December 1, 2006}}</ref>\n \n[[File:Marsdustdevil2.gif|thumb|center|800px|Video of a dust devil on Mars, photographed by ''Spirit''.

Here it was found that Husband Hill has two summits, with one a little higher than the other. On September 29 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2004|09|29}}), ''Spirit'' reached the real summit of Husband Hill. The rover was the first spacecraft to climb atop a mountain on another planet. The whole distance driven totaled 4971 meters.\nThe summit itself was flat. ''Spirit'' took a 360 degree panorama in real color, which included the whole Gusev crater. At night the rover observed the moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] in order to determine their orbits better.<ref name=\"nasa_2010_189\">{{cite web \n|authors=Staff |title=NASA Rover Finds Clue to Mars' Past And Environment for Life |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/news/mer20100603.html |work=[[NASA]] |date=2010-06-03 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}</ref> On sol 656 ''Spirit'' surveyed the Mars sky and the opacity of the atmosphere with its pancam to make a coordinated science campaign with the Hubble Space Telescope in Earth orbit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2005.html#sol655|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\nFrom the peak ''Spirit'' spotted a striking formation, which was dubbed \"Home Plate\". This was an interesting target, but ''Spirit'' would be driven later to the McCool Hill to tilt its solar panels towards the sun in the coming winter. At the end of October the rover was driven downhill and to Home Plate. On the way down ''Spirit'' reached the rock formation named \"Comanche\" on sol 690. Scientists used data from all three spectrometers to find out that about one-fourth of the composition of Comanche is magnesium iron carbonate. That concentration is 10 times higher than for any previously identified carbonate in a Martian rock. Carbonates originate in wet, near-neutral conditions but dissolve in acid. The find at Comanche is the first unambiguous evidence from the Mars Exploration Mission rovers for a past Martian environment that may have been more favorable to life than the wet but acidic conditions indicated by the rovers' earlier finds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/multimedia/gallery/comanche-no-label.html|title=NASA \u2013 Carbonate-Containing Martian Rocks (False Color)|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n{{Wide image|Everest Panorama from Mars.jpg|1100px|View from the Summit taken by ''Spirit'' on August 23, 2005, as the rover completed the climb up Husband Hill.}}\n\n=== 2006 ===\n\n==== Driving to McCool Hill ====\nIn 2006 ''Spirit'' drove towards an area dubbed Home Plate, and reached it in February. For events in 2006 by NASA see [http://marsrover.nasa.gov/mission/status_spirit_2006.html NASA Spirit Archive 2006]\n\n''Spirit's'' next stop was originally planned to be the north face of [[McCool Hill]], where ''Spirit'' would receive adequate sunlight during the Martian winter. On March 16, 2006 JPL announced that ''Spirit's'' troublesome front wheel had stopped working altogether. Despite this, ''Spirit'' was still making progress toward McCool Hill because the control team programmed the rover to drive toward McCool Hill backwards, dragging its broken wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll.html#sol778|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>  In late March, ''Spirit'' encountered loose soil that was impeding its progress toward McCool Hill. A decision was made to terminate attempts to reach McCool Hill and instead park on a nearby ridge named Low Ridge Haven.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right \n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Home plate anim.gif\n| width1    = {{#expr: (130 * 331 / 285 ) round 0}}\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = Curious rock near edge of \"Home Plate\" with a jutting portion.

The rover made its first drive, a short turn to position targets of interest within reach of the robotic arm, in early November 2006, following the shortest days of winter and solar conjunction when communications with Earth were severely limited.\n\nWhile at Low Ridge, ''Spirit'' imaged two rocks of similar chemical nature to that of ''Opportunity'''s [[Heat Shield Rock]], a [[meteorite]] on the surface of Mars. Named \"Zhong Shan\" for [[Sun Yat-sen]] and \"Allan Hills\" for the [[Allan Hills|location]] in [[Antarctica]] where several Martian meteorites have been found, they stood out against the background rocks that were darker. Further spectrographic testing is being done to determine the exact composition of these rocks, which may turn out to also be meteorites.\n\n=== 2007 ===\n\n==== Software upgrade ====\nOn January 4, 2007 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2007|01|04}}), both rovers received new flight software to the onboard computers. The update was received just in time for the third anniversary of their landing. The new systems let the rovers decide whether or not to transmit an image, and whether or not to extend their arms to examine rocks, which would save much time for scientists as they would not have to sift through hundreds of images to find the one they want, or examine the surroundings to decide to extend the arms and examine the rocks.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/01/04/tech-mars.html | work=CBC News | title=Old rovers learn new tricks | date=January 4, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Silica Valley====\n[[File:Spirit Mars Silica April 20 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rover exposes silica-rich dust]]\n''Spirit'''s dead wheel turned out to have a silver lining. As it was traveling in March 2007, pulling the dead wheel behind, the wheel scraped off the upper layer of the Martian soil, uncovering a patch of ground that scientists say shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life. It is similar to areas on Earth where water or steam from hot springs came into contact with volcanic rocks. On Earth, these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria, said rover chief scientist [[Steve Squyres]]. \"We're really excited about this,\" he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The area is extremely rich in [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]\u2013the main ingredient of window glass. The researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways. One: hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolved silica at one location and then carried it to another (i.e. a geyser). Two: acidic steam rising through cracks in rocks  stripped them of their mineral components, leaving silica behind. \"The important thing is that whether it is one hypothesis or the other, the implications for the former habitability of Mars are pretty much the same,\" Squyres explained to BBC News. Hot water provides an environment in which [[microbe]]s can thrive and the precipitation of that silica entombs and preserves them. Squyres added, \"You can go to [[hot spring]]s and you can go to [[fumarole]]s and at either place on Earth it is teeming with life \u2013 [[Microorganism|microbial life]].\"<ref name=\"Amos\">{{cite news  | last = Amos  | first = Jonathan    | title = Mars robot unearths microbe clue   | work = NASA says its robot rover Spirit has made one of its most significant discoveries on the surface of Mars. |publisher=BBC News  | date = December 11, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7137793.stm  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"20071210a\">{{cite web  | last = Bertster  | first =  Guy   | title = Mars Rover Investigates Signs of Steamy Martian Past  | work = Press Release  | publisher = Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California  | date = December 10, 2007  | url = http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20071210a.html  | accessdate =December 12, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==== Global dust storm and Home Plate ====\nDuring 2007 ''Spirit'' spent several months near the base of the Home Plate plateau. On sol 1306 ''Spirit'' climbed onto the eastern edge of the plateau. In September and October it examined rocks and soils at several locations on the southern half of the plateau. On November 6, ''Spirit'' had reached the western edge of Home Plate, and started taking pictures for a panoramic overview of the western valley, with Grissom Hill and Husband Hill visible. The panorama image was published on NASA's website on January 3, 2008 to little attention, until January 23, when an independent website published a magnified detail of the image that showed a rock feature a few centimeters high resembling a humanoid figure seen from the side with its right arm partially raised.<ref>[http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001305/ Planetary.org] Emily Lakdawalla, ''Teeny little Bigfoot on Mars'', January 23, 2008 | 12:41 PST | 20:41 UTC</ref><ref>{{Cite APOD |date=January 29, 2008 |title=Spirit's West Valley Panorama image |access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mars Spirit rover's solar panels covered with Dust - October 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Circular projection showing ''Spirit'''s solar panels covered in dust \u2013 October 2007]]\nTowards the end of June 2007, a series of dust storms began clouding the Martian atmosphere with dust. The storms intensified and by July 20, both ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' were facing the real possibility of system failure due to lack of energy. NASA released a statement to the press that said (in part) \"We're rooting for our rovers to survive these storms, but they were never designed for conditions this intense\".<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2007-080| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=NASA Mars Rovers Braving Severe Dust Storms| date=July 27, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> The key problem caused by the dust storms was a dramatic reduction in solar energy caused by there being so much dust in the atmosphere that it was blocking 99 percent of direct sunlight to ''Opportunity'', and slightly more to ''Spirit''.\n\nNormally the solar arrays on the rovers are able to generate up to {{Convert|700|Wh}} of energy per [[Martian day]]. After the storms, the amount of energy generated was greatly reduced to {{Convert|128|Wh}}. If the rovers generate less than {{Convert|150|Wh}} per day they must start draining their batteries to run survival heaters. If the batteries run dry, key electrical elements are likely to fail due to the intense cold. Both rovers were put into the lowest-power setting in order to wait out the storms. In early August the storms began to clear slightly, allowing the rovers to successfully charge their batteries. They were kept in hibernation in order to wait out the remainder of the storm.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20070807a.html| accessdate=August 21, 2009| title=Martian Skies Brighten Slightly| date=August 7, 2007| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref>\n\n=== 2008 ===\n\n==== Hibernating ====\nThe main concern was the energy level for ''Spirit''. To increase the amount of light hitting the solar panels, the rover was parked in the northern part of Home Plate on as steep a slope as possible. It was expected that the level of dust cover on the solar panels would increase by 70 percent and that a slope of 30 degrees would be necessary to survive the winter. In February, a tilt of 29.9 degrees was achieved. Extra energy was available at times, and a high definition panorama named ''Bonestell'' was produced. At other times when there was only enough solar energy to recharge the batteries, communication with Earth was minimized and all unnecessary instruments were switched off. At winter solstice the energy production declined to 235 watt hours per sol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/status_spiritAll_2008.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover Mission: All Spirit Updates|website=marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==== Winter dust storm ====\nOn November 10, 2008, a large dust storm further reduced the output of the solar panels to {{Convert|89|Wh}} per day\u2014a critically low level.<ref>{{Cite press| url=http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/20081110a.html |accessdate=August 21, 2009|title=Dust Storm Cuts Energy Supply of NASA Mars Rover Spirit| date= November 10, 2008| publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]}}</ref> NASA officials were hopeful that ''Spirit'' would survive the storm, and that the energy level would rise once the storm had passed and the skies started clearing.

It is also possible that the rover had experienced a mission clock fault. If that had happened, the rover would have lost track of time and tried to remain asleep until enough sunlight struck the solar arrays to wake it. This state is called \"Solar Groovy.\" If the rover woke up from a mission clock fault, it would only listen. Starting on July 26, 2010 (sol {{age in sols|2004|01|04|2010|07|26}}), a new procedure to address the possible mission clock fault was implemented.\n\nEach sol, the Deep Space Network mission controllers sent a set of X-band \"Sweep & Beep\" commands. If the rover had experienced a mission clock fault and then had been awoken during the day, it would have listened during brief, 20-minute intervals during each hour awake. Due to the possible clock fault, the timing of these 20-minute listening intervals was not known, so multiple \"Sweep & Beep\" commands were sent.

Sulfate was found, and it needs water to form. \nWishstone contained a great deal of plagioclase, some olivine, and [[anhydrate]] (a sulfate). Peace rocks showed [[sulfur]] and strong evidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected. Watchtower class rocks lack olivine consequently they may have been altered by water. The Independence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite a member of the smectite group). Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form.\nOne type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, [[phosphorus]], [[calcium]], and iron.<ref name=\"Ming2005JE002560\" />\nAlso, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe<sup>3+</sup> form, which would happen if water had been present.<ref name=\"Bell\" />\n\nTowards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure [[silica]] were found in the soil.<ref name=\"Sky & Telescope\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/19177609.html|title=Mars Rover Uncovers Ancient Hot Springs|publisher=SkyandTelescope.com|date=2008-05-22|accessdate=2012-08-01}}</ref>  The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20070521.html|title=NASA \u2013 Mars Rover Spirit Unearths Surprise Evidence of Wetter Past|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Spirit'' stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or [[Mini-TES]] and confirmed the presence of large amounts of [[carbonate]]-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water.

However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates that only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component that was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.\n\n==Astronomy==\n{{see also|Astronomy on Mars}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = PIA05547-Spirit Rover-Earth seen from Mars.png\n| width1 = {{#expr: (200 * (1194 / 1007)) round 0}}\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Earth]] from Mars\n| image2 = Phobos & Deimos full thumb.png\n| width2 = {{#expr: (200 * (200 / 213)) round 0}}\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Night sky of Mars showing [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] (left) and [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] (right) in front of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]], as seen by [[Mars Exploration Rover]] ''Spirit'' on August 26, 2005.

However, in mid-December 2009, to the surprise of the engineers, the right front wheel showed slight movement in a wheel-test on sol 2113 and clearly rotated with normal resistance on three of four wheel-tests on sol 2117, but stalled on the fourth.

2013 departure of Monmouth and Quinnipiac, the NEC had 6 rivalry matchups in the conference; which is most prevalent during NEC's men's and women's basketball \"Rivalry Week.\"  The concept of playing back-to-back games against a local rival the same week is the only one of its kind among the nation's 31 NCAA Division I conferences.  The pre-2013 NEC rivalries are as follows (with the current NEC team listed first in the matchups that are now non-conference):\n\n;Currently in-conference\n*'''[[Battle of Brooklyn (college rivalry)|Battle of Brooklyn]]''': LIU vs. St. Francis Brooklyn\n*'''Keystone Clash''': Robert Morris vs. Saint Francis (PA)\n*'''The Duel in New England''': Central Connecticut vs. Bryant\n*'''NY-MD Showdown''': Mount St. Mary's vs. Wagner\n\n;Non-conference as of 2013\u201314\n*'''Garden State Rivalry''': Fairleigh Dickinson vs. Monmouth\n*'''Governor's Cup''': Sacred Heart vs. Quinnipiac\n\n==Brenda Weare Commissioner's Cup==\nThe NEC Commissioner's Cup was instituted during the 1986-87 season with Long Island winning the inaugural award. Cup points are awarded in each NEC sponsored sport.  For men's and women's basketball, men's and women's soccer, women's volleyball, football, women's bowling, softball, men's and women's lacrosse, and baseball, the final regular season standings are used to determine Cup points.  Starting with the 2012-13 season, the Conference began awarding three bonus points to the NEC Tournament champion in those sports.  In all other sports, points are awarded based on the finish at NEC Championship events.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Overall !! Men's !!

2013 departure of Monmouth and Quinnipiac, the NEC had 6 rivalry matchups in the conference; which is most prevalent during NEC's men's and women's basketball \"Rivalry Week.\"  The concept of playing back-to-back games against a local rival the same week is the only one of its kind among the nation's 31 NCAA Division I conferences.  The pre-2013 NEC rivalries are as follows (with the current NEC team listed first in the matchups that are now non-conference):\n\n;Currently in-conference\n*'''[[Battle of Brooklyn (college rivalry)|Battle of Brooklyn]]''': LIU vs. St. Francis Brooklyn\n*'''Keystone Clash''': Robert Morris vs. Saint Francis (PA)\n*'''The Duel in New England''': Central Connecticut vs. Bryant\n*'''NY-MD Showdown''': Mount St. Mary's vs. Wagner\n\n;Non-conference as of 2013\u201314\n*'''Garden State Rivalry''': Fairleigh Dickinson vs. Monmouth\n*'''Governor's Cup''': Sacred Heart vs. Quinnipiac\n\n==Brenda Weare Commissioner's Cup==\nThe NEC Commissioner's Cup was instituted during the 1986-87 season with Long Island winning the inaugural award. Cup points are awarded in each NEC sponsored sport.  For men's and women's basketball, men's and women's soccer, women's volleyball, football, women's bowling, softball, men's and women's lacrosse, and baseball, the final regular season standings are used to determine Cup points.  Starting with the 2012-13 season, the Conference began awarding three bonus points to the NEC Tournament champion in those sports.  In all other sports, points are awarded based on the finish at NEC Championship events.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Overall !! Men's !!

An association for these refugees, commonly referred to as \"Ming-Huong-Xa (\u660e\u9999\u793e)\" first appeared between 1645\u201353.<ref>Lee (2010), p. 6</ref> Around this time, H\u1ed9i An and Vietnamese territories further south were under the control of the [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords]], and the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers allowed Vietnamese refugees to freely settle in disputed frontier lands with remnants of the Champa kingdom and the Khmer empire. According to the Dai Nam Chronicle, a Chinese general from [[Guangxi]], Duong Ngan Dich led a band of 3,000 Ming loyalists to Hu\u1ebf to seek asylum. The Nguy\u1ec5n court allowed Duong and his followers to resettle in [[\u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province|\u0110\u1ed3ng Nai]], which had been newly acquired from the Khmers. Duong's followers named their settlement as \"Minh Huong\", to recall their allegiance to the Ming Dynasty.<ref name=\"Khanh15\"/> More Chinese refugees followed suit to settle in H\u1ed9i An and the frontier territory in [[Cochinchina]] such as [[M\u1ea1c C\u1eedu]], who had earlier settled in the [[Kampot (City)|Kampot]]\u2013[[H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean]] area in the 1680s under the patronage of the Cambodian king, Chey Chettha IV. However, Cambodia fell into Thai rule under [[Taksin]], and, in 1708, M\u1ea1c C\u1eedu switched his alliance to the Nguy\u1ec5n lords, paying tribute to Hu\u1ebf. M\u1ea1c C\u1eedu was given autonomy to rule Ha Tien in return for his tribute, and throughout the 18th century his descendants implemented their own administrative policies, independent of Hu\u1ebf and Cambodia. The presence of these semi-autonomous fiefdoms run by Chinese refugees encouraged more Chinese to settle in the South.<ref>Khanh (1993), pp. 15\u201316</ref> In contrast, very few Chinese refugees chose to settle in territories controlled by the [[Tr\u1ecbnh lords]], who still mandated Chinese refugees to strictly follow Vietnamese customs and refrain from contacts with the local Vietnamese populace in the cities.<ref>Lee (2010), pp. 8\u20139</ref>\n\nVietnamese women were wedded as wives of the Han Chinese Minh H\u01b0\u01a1ng \u660e\u9109 who moved to Vietnam during the Ming dynasty's fall.

Chinese trade and immigration began to increase towards the earlier half of the 18th century as population and economic pressures encouraged more Chinese men to seek trade opportunities in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam. It was around this time that the descendants of the Ming Chinese refugees\u2013often referred to as Ming Huong Chinese\u2013begin to foster a separate ethno-cultural identity from the newer Chinese immigrants, whom they refer to as \"Thanh Nhan (\u6e05\u4eba)\", or Qing people. The Thanh Nhan form independent [[Kongsi|Chinese associations]] along the same dialect group or [[Chinese clan|clans]] in cities and towns where large populations prevail, including [[Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn, Ho Chi Minh City|Cholon]], [[H\u1ed9i An]] and some towns in the Mekong Delta.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vietnam's Expansion & Colonial Diaspora (1471\u20131859)|url=http://blogs.bauer.uh.edu/vietDiaspora/feature-articles/vietnam's-external-expansion-and-colonial-diasporas-1471-1859/|publisher=University of Houston Bauer The Global Viet|accessdate=4 January 2013|author=Long Le|date=February 22, 2008}}</ref> The Minh Huong Chinese also formed similar associations, and notable examples include the \u0110\u00ecnh Minh H\u01b0\u01a1ng Gia Th\u1ea1nh in Cholon, and the Dinh Tien Hien Lang Minh Huong in H\u1ed9i An.<ref>Cooke, Li (2004), pp. 85\u201386</ref> Both groups of Chinese were also very active in the interior affairs of Vietnamese society; notable Minh Huong Chinese such as Trinh Hoai Duc and Ngo Nhan Tinh who became ministers under the Nguy\u1ec5n court during [[Gia Long]]'s reign. Many Thanh Nhan Chinese also participated as ragtag militia during the [[T\u00e2y S\u01a1n]] rebellion, although their loyalties were divided based on their location of residence. The Thanh Nhan Chinese in [[Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh]] and [[Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a]] sided with Gia Long, whereas some Chinese in the Mekong Delta regions sided with the Khmers until the late 1790s.<ref>Cooke, Li (2004), pp. 47\u201348, 86</ref>\n\n===Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty and French rule: 19th\u201320th centuries===\n[[Image:Commercant chinois Hanoi 2.jpg|thumb|right|Hoa merchant in [[Hanoi]] (1885, photography by [[Charles-\u00c9douard Hocquard]])]]\nThe Thanh Nhan Chinese made their living by exporting rice to other Southeast Asian countries, and their participation increased greatly in the years during the early 18th century after the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n rebellion. Under local laws, rice exports to other countries was tightly regulated, but the Chinese largely ignored this rule and exported rice en masse. The prices of rice witnessed an increase of 50\u2013100% in the 1820s as a result of these exports, which irked the Nguy\u1ec5n court under Emperor [[Minh M\u1ea1ng]].<ref>Cooke, Li (2004), pp. 87\u201388</ref> Minh M\u1ea1ng's mandarin, [[L\u00ea V\u0103n Duy\u1ec7t]] noticed that the Chinese had a great autonomy over trade affairs in Gia Dinh, which was partly attributed to the patronage of Trinh Hoai Duc who was serving as the governor of the province. Minh M\u1ea1ng introduced a new series of measures to curb Chinese trade from 1831 onwards, and started by introducing new restrictions to which residents are banned from overseas travel, which culminated in a brief revolt among Gia Dinh's residents in 1833.<ref>Cooke, Li (2004), pp. 94, 96</ref> The Nguy\u1ec5n court also experimented with measures to assimilate the Chinese immigrants; in 1839 an edict was issued to abolish the Chinese clan associations in Vietnamese-ruled Cambodia, which proved to be ineffective. [[Minh M\u1ea1ng]]'s son, [[Thi\u1ec7u Tr\u1ecb]], introduced a new law to allow only Chinese-born immigrants to register with the Chinese clan associations, whereas their local born male descendants are allowed to register with the Minh-Huong-xa and adorn the Vietnamese costume. The Nguy\u1ec5n court also showed signs of subtle discrimination against people of Chinese origin; only one Minh Huong Chinese was promoted to a Mandarin. This sharply contrasted with the high representation of people of Chinese descent who were able to serve the Nguy\u1ec5n court under Gia Long's reign.<ref>Cooke, Li (2004), p. 95</ref>\n\nChinese immigration into Vietnam visibly increased following the French [[Conquest of Cochinchina|colonisation of Vietnam]] from 1860 onwards following the signing of the [[Convention of Peking]] whereby the rights of Chinese to seek employment overseas were officially recognised by the Chinese, British and French authorities. Unlike their Vietnamese predecessors, the French were very receptive of these Chinese immigrants as it provided an opportunity to stimulate trade and industry, and they generally found employment as labourers or middlemen. The French established a special Immigration Bureau in 1874 requiring Chinese immigrants to register with the Chinese clan and dialect group associations and eased trade restrictions that were previously in place.<ref>Khanh (1993), pp. 21\u201322</ref> Historians such as Khanh Tran viewed this as a divide-and-rule policy, and the intention of its implementation was to minimise the chances of any internal revolt against the French authorities.<ref>Khanh (1993), p. 28</ref><ref>Tong (2010), p. 77</ref> The Chinese population nevertheless witnessed an exponential increase in the late 19th century and more so in the 20th century; between the 1870s and 1890s, some 20,000 Chinese settled in Cochinchina. Another 600,000 arrived in the 1920s and 1930s, and peaks in the migration patterns was especially pronounced during the 1920s and late 1940s when the effects of fighting and economic instability arising from the [[Chinese Civil War]] became pronounced.<ref name=\"Khanh22\">Khanh (1993), pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\n[[Crocodile]]s were eaten by Vietnamese while they were taboo and off limits for Chinese.

First-generation immigrants who were born in China, however, were not allowed to apply for Vietnamese citizenship and had to apply for residential permits that were to be renewed periodically, on top of paying residential taxes.\n* 29 August 1956: Decree 52 was passed which required all Vietnamese citizens regardless of their ethnic origin to adopt a Vietnamese name within six months, failing which they had to pay a heavy fine.\n* 6 September 1956: Decree 53 was issued which prohibited all foreigners from engaging in eleven different trades, all of which were dominated by ethnic Chinese. The foreign shareholders were required to liquidate their business or transfer their ownership to Vietnamese citizens within 6 months to 1 year, and failure to do so would result in deportation or a fine of up to 5 million piastres.<ref name=\"Khanh29\">Khanh (1993), pp. 28\u201329</ref>\n\nAs most ethnic Chinese in Vietnam were holders of [[Republic of China|ROC nationality]] in 1955, the measures greatly reduced the number of expatriate Chinese in South Vietnam. The fourth decree in particular had the effect of encouraging Chinese businessmen to transfer their assets to their local-born children. In 1955, the number of ROC nationals stood at 621,000, which was greatly reduced to 3,000 by 1958. The South Vietnamese government later relaxed its stance to foreign-born Chinese in 1963, and a new nationality law was passed to allow them the choice to retain their ROC nationality or adopt South Vietnamese citizenship. The following year, the Statistics Office created a new census category, \"Nguoi Viet goc Hoa\" (Vietnamese people of Chinese origin), whereby Vietnamese citizens of Chinese heritage were identified as such in all official documents.<ref name=\"Khanh29\"/> No further major measures were implemented to integrate or assimilate the Chinese after 1964. The Chinese sought cultural and economic pursuits more actively during President [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u|Thi\u1ec7u's]] rule, especially in the manufacturing, finance and transport industries. At the [[grassroots]] level, ethnic Vietnamese resentment against the Chinese was widespread for their dominance over the South Vietnamese economy.<ref>Khanh (1993), p. 32</ref>\n\nIn North Vietnam, the initially favorable situation of the Chinese minority began to deteriorate during the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1967\u20131968, friction started to occur in Sino-DRV relations, because the People's Republic of China disapproved both Hanoi\u2019s broadening cooperation with the [[Soviet Union]] and the North Vietnamese decision to start negotiations with the U.S. in Paris. Inspired by the Chinese embassy, the official newspaper of the ethnic Chinese community published a number of anti-Soviet articles until the DRV authorities replaced its editors with some more compliant cadres. Anxious to prevent Beijing from exerting a political influence on the Chinese minority, in the early 1970s the North Vietnamese leaders resorted to various methods of forced assimilation. At first they sought to pressure ethnic Chinese to adopt Vietnamese citizenship, but only a handful of Hoa cadres complied, most of whom were heavily assimilated individuals anyway. Thereupon the authorities attempted to seize the Chinese passports of the ethnic Chinese under various pretexts, but most Hoa refused to give up their passports. The regime made repeated efforts to transform the Chinese minority schools into mixed Chinese-Vietnamese schools in which Hoa children were to study together with Vietnamese pupils and the curriculum was to be based on the standard North Vietnamese curriculum. The authorities ceased to hire Hoa interpreters, nor did they employ Hoa in offices that were in regular contact with foreigners. Ethnic Chinese were rarely admitted to the military, and even if they volunteered for service, they could serve only in logistical units but not in troops sent to the front in South Vietnam. Following the [[Battle of the Paracel Islands]] (a Chinese action that Hanoi disapproved), the DRV authorities started to hinder the Hoa in visiting their relatives in the PRC.<ref>Bal\u00e1zs Szalontai, Hoa ki\u1ec1u \u1edf B\u1eafc Vi\u1ec7t Nam th\u1eddi chi\u1ebfn.

The control and regulation of markets was one of the most sensitive and persistent problems faced by the government following the beginning of North\u2013South integration in 1975. The government, in its doctrinaire efforts to communize the commercial, market-oriented Southern economy, faced several paradoxes. The first was the need both to cultivate and to control commercial activity by ethnic Chinese in the South, especially in [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (formerly Saigon). Chinese businesses controlled much of the economic activity in Ho Chi Minh City and South Vietnam. Following Vietnam's break with China in 1978, some Vietnamese leaders evidently feared the potential for espionage activities within the Chinese business community. On the one hand, Chinese-owned concerns controlled trade in a number of goods and services, such as pharmaceuticals, fertilizer distribution, grain milling and foreign-currency exchange, that were supposed to be state monopolies. On the other hand, savvy Chinese entrepreneurs provided excellent access to markets for Vietnamese exports through Hong Kong and Singapore. This access became increasingly important in the 1980s as a way of circumventing the boycott on trade with Vietnam imposed by a number of Asian and Western Nations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Herod|first=Bill|title=Vietnam \u2013 INTERNAL COMMERCE|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-14678.html|publisher=Country Data}}</ref> An announcement on March 24 outlawed all wholesale trade and large business activities, which forced around 30,000 businesses to close down overnight,<ref>Gibney, Hansen (2005), p. 664-5</ref><ref>''Far East Economic Review'', 14 April 1978, p. 12</ref> followed up by another that banned all private trade.<ref>''Far East Economic Review'', 5 May 1978, p. 10\u201311</ref><ref name=\"Asiaweek, 28 April 1978, p. 16-18\">''Asiaweek'', 28 April 1978, p. 16\u201318</ref> Further government policies forced former owners to become farmers in the countryside or join the armed forces and fight at the Vietnam-Cambodia border, and confiscated all old and foreign currencies, as well as any Vietnamese currency in excess of the [[United States dollar|US value]] of $250 for urban households and $150 by rural households.<ref name=\"Asiaweek, 28 April 1978, p. 16-18\"/><ref name=\"''Straits Times'', 4 May 1978, p. 26\">''Straits Times'', 4 May 1978, p. 26</ref><ref>''Straits Times'', 5 May 1978, p. 1</ref><ref>''Straits Times'', 30 May 1978, p. 12</ref><ref>''Straits Times'', 27 June 1978, p. 1</ref><ref>''Straits Times'', 22 May 1978, p. 1</ref>\n\nWhile such measures were targeted at all bourgeois elements, such measures hurt Hoa the hardest and resulted in the expropriation of Hoa properties in and around major cities.<ref>''Straits Times'', 10 June 1978, p. 1</ref><ref>Chang, Pao-min pg. 207</ref> Hoa communities offered widespread resistance and clashes left the streets of Cholon \"full of corpses\".<ref name=\"''Straits Times'', 4 May 1978, p. 26\"/><ref>''Straits Times'', 18 September 1978, p. 2</ref>  These measures, combined with external tensions stemming from Vietnam's dispute with Cambodia and China in 1978 and 1979 caused an exodus of the majority of the Hoa, of whom more than 170,000 fled overland into the province of [[Guangxi]], China, from the North and the remainder fled by boat from the South.

The government, in its doctrinaire efforts to nationalize the commercial, market-oriented Southern economy, faced several paradoxes. The first was the need both to cultivate and to control commercial activity by ethnic Chinese in the South, especially in Ho Chi Minh City. Chinese businesses controlled much of the commerce in Ho Chi Minh City and the South generally. Following the break with China in 1978, some Vietnamese leaders evidently feared the potential for espionage activities within the Chinese commercial community. On the one hand, Chinese-owned concerns controlled trade in a number of commodities and services, such as pharmaceuticals, fertilizer distribution, grain milling, and foreign-currency exchange, that were supposed to be state monopolies. On the other hand, Hoa merchants provided excellent access to markets for Vietnamese exports through Hong Kong and Singapore. This access became increasingly important in the 1980s as a way of circumventing the boycott on trade with Vietnam imposed by a number of Asian and Western nations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Herod|first=Bill|title=Vietnam \u2013 Internal Commerce|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-14678.html|publisher=Country Data}}</ref> Hoa have dominated several types of businesses such as selling rice, crewed junk, rice transportation, and ship building during their early arrival to Vietnam. Through enterprise, organization, and cooperation many Chinese became part of a prosperous, urban middle class that controlled the country's entire retail trade. Chinese retail shops filled every major Vietnamese town and sea route as rice selling and transportation were one of the most profitable businesses in the country. In addition, the Hoa became economically dominant in Saigon, where Chinese worked as vendors and sold an array of products as an industrious entrepreneurial ethnic group, producing much of the city's economic output. Many would then work as butchers and tailors, and then venture into confectionery. Many Chinese also worked as money lenders, bankers, and money changers. Products such as tea, porcelain, pharmaceuticals and medicine, furniture and cabinet-work were shipped to Vietnam from China. Government officials said the ethnic Chinese in [[Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn, Ho Chi Minh City|Cholon]] were also politically active in municipal interests and the [[Vietnamese Communist Party]], but their main interest was entrepreneurship. The Chinese feel secure in business as well as taking priorities in into focusing onto improving their social and cultural lives. About 20 percent of the 6,000 private companies and 150,000 individual small businesses in the city were run by Chinese.

An association for these refugees, commonly referred to as \"Ming-Huong-Xa (\u660e\u9999\u793e)\" first appeared between 1645\u201353.<ref>Lee (2010), p. 6</ref> Around this time, H\u1ed9i An and Vietnamese territories further south were under the control of the [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords]], and the Nguy\u1ec5n rulers allowed Vietnamese refugees to freely settle in disputed frontier lands with remnants of the Champa kingdom and the Khmer empire. According to the Dai Nam Chronicle, a Chinese general from [[Guangxi]], Duong Ngan Dich led a band of 3,000 Ming loyalists to Hu\u1ebf to seek asylum. The Nguy\u1ec5n court allowed Duong and his followers to resettle in [[\u0110\u1ed3ng Nai Province|\u0110\u1ed3ng Nai]], which had been newly acquired from the Khmers. Duong's followers named their settlement as \"Minh Huong\", to recall their allegiance to the Ming Dynasty.<ref name=\"Khanh15\"/> More Chinese refugees followed suit to settle in H\u1ed9i An and the frontier territory in [[Cochinchina]] such as [[M\u1ea1c C\u1eedu]], who had earlier settled in the [[Kampot (City)|Kampot]]\u2013[[H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean]] area in the 1680s under the patronage of the Cambodian king, Chey Chettha IV. However, Cambodia fell into Thai rule under [[Taksin]], and, in 1708, M\u1ea1c C\u1eedu switched his alliance to the Nguy\u1ec5n lords, paying tribute to Hu\u1ebf. M\u1ea1c C\u1eedu was given autonomy to rule Ha Tien in return for his tribute, and throughout the 18th century his descendants implemented their own administrative policies, independent of Hu\u1ebf and Cambodia. The presence of these semi-autonomous fiefdoms run by Chinese refugees encouraged more Chinese to settle in the South.<ref>Khanh (1993), pp. 15\u201316</ref> In contrast, very few Chinese refugees chose to settle in territories controlled by the [[Tr\u1ecbnh lords]], who still mandated Chinese refugees to strictly follow Vietnamese customs and refrain from contacts with the local Vietnamese populace in the cities.<ref>Lee (2010), pp. 8\u20139</ref>\n\nVietnamese women were wedded as wives of the Han Chinese Minh H\u01b0\u01a1ng \u660e\u9109 who moved to Vietnam during the Ming dynasty's fall.

Chinese trade and immigration began to increase towards the earlier half of the 18th century as population and economic pressures encouraged more Chinese men to seek trade opportunities in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam. It was around this time that the descendants of the Ming Chinese refugees\u2013often referred to as Ming Huong Chinese\u2013begin to foster a separate ethno-cultural identity from the newer Chinese immigrants, whom they refer to as \"Thanh Nhan (\u6e05\u4eba)\", or Qing people. The Thanh Nhan form independent [[Kongsi|Chinese associations]] along the same dialect group or [[Chinese clan|clans]] in cities and towns where large populations prevail, including [[Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn, Ho Chi Minh City|Cholon]], [[H\u1ed9i An]] and some towns in the Mekong Delta.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vietnam's Expansion & Colonial Diaspora (1471\u20131859)|url=http://blogs.bauer.uh.edu/vietDiaspora/feature-articles/vietnam's-external-expansion-and-colonial-diasporas-1471-1859/|publisher=University of Houston Bauer The Global Viet|accessdate=4 January 2013|author=Long Le|date=February 22, 2008}}</ref> The Minh Huong Chinese also formed similar associations, and notable examples include the \u0110\u00ecnh Minh H\u01b0\u01a1ng Gia Th\u1ea1nh in Cholon, and the Dinh Tien Hien Lang Minh Huong in H\u1ed9i An.<ref>Cooke, Li (2004), pp. 85\u201386</ref> Both groups of Chinese were also very active in the interior affairs of Vietnamese society; notable Minh Huong Chinese such as Trinh Hoai Duc and Ngo Nhan Tinh who became ministers under the Nguy\u1ec5n court during [[Gia Long]]'s reign. Many Thanh Nhan Chinese also participated as ragtag militia during the [[T\u00e2y S\u01a1n]] rebellion, although their loyalties were divided based on their location of residence. The Thanh Nhan Chinese in [[Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh]] and [[Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a]] sided with Gia Long, whereas some Chinese in the Mekong Delta regions sided with the Khmers until the late 1790s.<ref>Cooke, Li (2004), pp. 47\u201348, 86</ref>\n\n===Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty and French rule: 19th\u201320th centuries===\n[[Image:Commercant chinois Hanoi 2.jpg|thumb|right|Hoa merchant in [[Hanoi]] (1885, photography by [[Charles-\u00c9douard Hocquard]])]]\nThe Thanh Nhan Chinese made their living by exporting rice to other Southeast Asian countries, and their participation increased greatly in the years during the early 18th century after the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n rebellion. Under local laws, rice exports to other countries was tightly regulated, but the Chinese largely ignored this rule and exported rice en masse. The prices of rice witnessed an increase of 50\u2013100% in the 1820s as a result of these exports, which irked the Nguy\u1ec5n court under Emperor [[Minh M\u1ea1ng]].<ref>Cooke, Li (2004), pp. 87\u201388</ref> Minh M\u1ea1ng's mandarin, [[L\u00ea V\u0103n Duy\u1ec7t]] noticed that the Chinese had a great autonomy over trade affairs in Gia Dinh, which was partly attributed to the patronage of Trinh Hoai Duc who was serving as the governor of the province. Minh M\u1ea1ng introduced a new series of measures to curb Chinese trade from 1831 onwards, and started by introducing new restrictions to which residents are banned from overseas travel, which culminated in a brief revolt among Gia Dinh's residents in 1833.<ref>Cooke, Li (2004), pp. 94, 96</ref> The Nguy\u1ec5n court also experimented with measures to assimilate the Chinese immigrants; in 1839 an edict was issued to abolish the Chinese clan associations in Vietnamese-ruled Cambodia, which proved to be ineffective. [[Minh M\u1ea1ng]]'s son, [[Thi\u1ec7u Tr\u1ecb]], introduced a new law to allow only Chinese-born immigrants to register with the Chinese clan associations, whereas their local born male descendants are allowed to register with the Minh-Huong-xa and adorn the Vietnamese costume. The Nguy\u1ec5n court also showed signs of subtle discrimination against people of Chinese origin; only one Minh Huong Chinese was promoted to a Mandarin. This sharply contrasted with the high representation of people of Chinese descent who were able to serve the Nguy\u1ec5n court under Gia Long's reign.<ref>Cooke, Li (2004), p. 95</ref>\n\nChinese immigration into Vietnam visibly increased following the French [[Conquest of Cochinchina|colonisation of Vietnam]] from 1860 onwards following the signing of the [[Convention of Peking]] whereby the rights of Chinese to seek employment overseas were officially recognised by the Chinese, British and French authorities. Unlike their Vietnamese predecessors, the French were very receptive of these Chinese immigrants as it provided an opportunity to stimulate trade and industry, and they generally found employment as labourers or middlemen. The French established a special Immigration Bureau in 1874 requiring Chinese immigrants to register with the Chinese clan and dialect group associations and eased trade restrictions that were previously in place.<ref>Khanh (1993), pp. 21\u201322</ref> Historians such as Khanh Tran viewed this as a divide-and-rule policy, and the intention of its implementation was to minimise the chances of any internal revolt against the French authorities.<ref>Khanh (1993), p. 28</ref><ref>Tong (2010), p. 77</ref> The Chinese population nevertheless witnessed an exponential increase in the late 19th century and more so in the 20th century; between the 1870s and 1890s, some 20,000 Chinese settled in Cochinchina. Another 600,000 arrived in the 1920s and 1930s, and peaks in the migration patterns was especially pronounced during the 1920s and late 1940s when the effects of fighting and economic instability arising from the [[Chinese Civil War]] became pronounced.<ref name=\"Khanh22\">Khanh (1993), pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\n[[Crocodile]]s were eaten by Vietnamese while they were taboo and off limits for Chinese.

First-generation immigrants who were born in China, however, were not allowed to apply for Vietnamese citizenship and had to apply for residential permits that were to be renewed periodically, on top of paying residential taxes.\n* 29 August 1956: Decree 52 was passed which required all Vietnamese citizens regardless of their ethnic origin to adopt a Vietnamese name within six months, failing which they had to pay a heavy fine.\n* 6 September 1956: Decree 53 was issued which prohibited all foreigners from engaging in eleven different trades, all of which were dominated by ethnic Chinese. The foreign shareholders were required to liquidate their business or transfer their ownership to Vietnamese citizens within 6 months to 1 year, and failure to do so would result in deportation or a fine of up to 5 million piastres.<ref name=\"Khanh29\">Khanh (1993), pp. 28\u201329</ref>\n\nAs most ethnic Chinese in Vietnam were holders of [[Republic of China|ROC nationality]] in 1955, the measures greatly reduced the number of expatriate Chinese in South Vietnam. The fourth decree in particular had the effect of encouraging Chinese businessmen to transfer their assets to their local-born children. In 1955, the number of ROC nationals stood at 621,000, which was greatly reduced to 3,000 by 1958. The South Vietnamese government later relaxed its stance to foreign-born Chinese in 1963, and a new nationality law was passed to allow them the choice to retain their ROC nationality or adopt South Vietnamese citizenship. The following year, the Statistics Office created a new census category, \"Nguoi Viet goc Hoa\" (Vietnamese people of Chinese origin), whereby Vietnamese citizens of Chinese heritage were identified as such in all official documents.<ref name=\"Khanh29\"/> No further major measures were implemented to integrate or assimilate the Chinese after 1964. The Chinese sought cultural and economic pursuits more actively during President [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Thi\u1ec7u|Thi\u1ec7u's]] rule, especially in the manufacturing, finance and transport industries. At the [[grassroots]] level, ethnic Vietnamese resentment against the Chinese was widespread for their dominance over the South Vietnamese economy.<ref>Khanh (1993), p. 32</ref>\n\nIn North Vietnam, the initially favorable situation of the Chinese minority began to deteriorate during the [[Vietnam War]]. In 1967\u20131968, friction started to occur in Sino-DRV relations, because the People's Republic of China disapproved both Hanoi\u2019s broadening cooperation with the [[Soviet Union]] and the North Vietnamese decision to start negotiations with the U.S. in Paris. Inspired by the Chinese embassy, the official newspaper of the ethnic Chinese community published a number of anti-Soviet articles until the DRV authorities replaced its editors with some more compliant cadres. Anxious to prevent Beijing from exerting a political influence on the Chinese minority, in the early 1970s the North Vietnamese leaders resorted to various methods of forced assimilation. At first they sought to pressure ethnic Chinese to adopt Vietnamese citizenship, but only a handful of Hoa cadres complied, most of whom were heavily assimilated individuals anyway. Thereupon the authorities attempted to seize the Chinese passports of the ethnic Chinese under various pretexts, but most Hoa refused to give up their passports. The regime made repeated efforts to transform the Chinese minority schools into mixed Chinese-Vietnamese schools in which Hoa children were to study together with Vietnamese pupils and the curriculum was to be based on the standard North Vietnamese curriculum. The authorities ceased to hire Hoa interpreters, nor did they employ Hoa in offices that were in regular contact with foreigners. Ethnic Chinese were rarely admitted to the military, and even if they volunteered for service, they could serve only in logistical units but not in troops sent to the front in South Vietnam. Following the [[Battle of the Paracel Islands]] (a Chinese action that Hanoi disapproved), the DRV authorities started to hinder the Hoa in visiting their relatives in the PRC.<ref>Bal\u00e1zs Szalontai, Hoa ki\u1ec1u \u1edf B\u1eafc Vi\u1ec7t Nam th\u1eddi chi\u1ebfn.

The control and regulation of markets was one of the most sensitive and persistent problems faced by the government following the beginning of North\u2013South integration in 1975. The government, in its doctrinaire efforts to communize the commercial, market-oriented Southern economy, faced several paradoxes. The first was the need both to cultivate and to control commercial activity by ethnic Chinese in the South, especially in [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (formerly Saigon). Chinese businesses controlled much of the economic activity in Ho Chi Minh City and South Vietnam. Following Vietnam's break with China in 1978, some Vietnamese leaders evidently feared the potential for espionage activities within the Chinese business community. On the one hand, Chinese-owned concerns controlled trade in a number of goods and services, such as pharmaceuticals, fertilizer distribution, grain milling and foreign-currency exchange, that were supposed to be state monopolies. On the other hand, savvy Chinese entrepreneurs provided excellent access to markets for Vietnamese exports through Hong Kong and Singapore. This access became increasingly important in the 1980s as a way of circumventing the boycott on trade with Vietnam imposed by a number of Asian and Western Nations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Herod|first=Bill|title=Vietnam \u2013 INTERNAL COMMERCE|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-14678.html|publisher=Country Data}}</ref> An announcement on March 24 outlawed all wholesale trade and large business activities, which forced around 30,000 businesses to close down overnight,<ref>Gibney, Hansen (2005), p. 664-5</ref><ref>''Far East Economic Review'', 14 April 1978, p. 12</ref> followed up by another that banned all private trade.<ref>''Far East Economic Review'', 5 May 1978, p. 10\u201311</ref><ref name=\"Asiaweek, 28 April 1978, p. 16-18\">''Asiaweek'', 28 April 1978, p. 16\u201318</ref> Further government policies forced former owners to become farmers in the countryside or join the armed forces and fight at the Vietnam-Cambodia border, and confiscated all old and foreign currencies, as well as any Vietnamese currency in excess of the [[United States dollar|US value]] of $250 for urban households and $150 by rural households.<ref name=\"Asiaweek, 28 April 1978, p. 16-18\"/><ref name=\"''Straits Times'', 4 May 1978, p. 26\">''Straits Times'', 4 May 1978, p. 26</ref><ref>''Straits Times'', 5 May 1978, p. 1</ref><ref>''Straits Times'', 30 May 1978, p. 12</ref><ref>''Straits Times'', 27 June 1978, p. 1</ref><ref>''Straits Times'', 22 May 1978, p. 1</ref>\n\nWhile such measures were targeted at all bourgeois elements, such measures hurt Hoa the hardest and resulted in the expropriation of Hoa properties in and around major cities.<ref>''Straits Times'', 10 June 1978, p. 1</ref><ref>Chang, Pao-min pg. 207</ref> Hoa communities offered widespread resistance and clashes left the streets of Cholon \"full of corpses\".<ref name=\"''Straits Times'', 4 May 1978, p. 26\"/><ref>''Straits Times'', 18 September 1978, p. 2</ref>  These measures, combined with external tensions stemming from Vietnam's dispute with Cambodia and China in 1978 and 1979 caused an exodus of the majority of the Hoa, of whom more than 170,000 fled overland into the province of [[Guangxi]], China, from the North and the remainder fled by boat from the South.

The government, in its doctrinaire efforts to nationalize the commercial, market-oriented Southern economy, faced several paradoxes. The first was the need both to cultivate and to control commercial activity by ethnic Chinese in the South, especially in Ho Chi Minh City. Chinese businesses controlled much of the commerce in Ho Chi Minh City and the South generally. Following the break with China in 1978, some Vietnamese leaders evidently feared the potential for espionage activities within the Chinese commercial community. On the one hand, Chinese-owned concerns controlled trade in a number of commodities and services, such as pharmaceuticals, fertilizer distribution, grain milling, and foreign-currency exchange, that were supposed to be state monopolies. On the other hand, Hoa merchants provided excellent access to markets for Vietnamese exports through Hong Kong and Singapore. This access became increasingly important in the 1980s as a way of circumventing the boycott on trade with Vietnam imposed by a number of Asian and Western nations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Herod|first=Bill|title=Vietnam \u2013 Internal Commerce|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-14678.html|publisher=Country Data}}</ref> Hoa have dominated several types of businesses such as selling rice, crewed junk, rice transportation, and ship building during their early arrival to Vietnam. Through enterprise, organization, and cooperation many Chinese became part of a prosperous, urban middle class that controlled the country's entire retail trade. Chinese retail shops filled every major Vietnamese town and sea route as rice selling and transportation were one of the most profitable businesses in the country. In addition, the Hoa became economically dominant in Saigon, where Chinese worked as vendors and sold an array of products as an industrious entrepreneurial ethnic group, producing much of the city's economic output. Many would then work as butchers and tailors, and then venture into confectionery. Many Chinese also worked as money lenders, bankers, and money changers. Products such as tea, porcelain, pharmaceuticals and medicine, furniture and cabinet-work were shipped to Vietnam from China. Government officials said the ethnic Chinese in [[Ch\u1ee3 L\u1edbn, Ho Chi Minh City|Cholon]] were also politically active in municipal interests and the [[Vietnamese Communist Party]], but their main interest was entrepreneurship. The Chinese feel secure in business as well as taking priorities in into focusing onto improving their social and cultural lives. About 20 percent of the 6,000 private companies and 150,000 individual small businesses in the city were run by Chinese.

After they perform covers of famous songs, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to guess who the celebrities could be after each performs, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. It was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] as \"Monster\" and [[Wayne Brady]] as \"Fox\", respectively. While noted for being more positive than other [[reality television]] shows, the series has received generally unfavorable reviews from critics. However, its costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination. The series has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from being revealed before an episode airs.

After they perform covers of famous songs, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to guess who the celebrities could be after each performs, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. It was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] as \"Monster\" and [[Wayne Brady]] as \"Fox\", respectively. While noted for being more positive than other [[reality television]] shows, the series has received generally unfavorable reviews from critics. However, its costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage.

She was launched in [[Warrington]] on the [[River Mersey]] on 4 October 1853 - it had taken just six months to build her. She was 230 feet in length with a 40-foot [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] and displaced 1,750 tons, while 4,000 tons of cargo could be carried in holds 28 feet deep below three [[deck (ship)|decks]]. She was named after Charles Tayleur, founder of the Vulcan Engineering Works, Bank Quay, Warrington.\n\nThe new ship was chartered by White Star to serve the booming [[Australia]]n trade routes, as transport to and from the colony was in high demand due to the discovery of [[gold]] there.\n\n=== Disaster ===\n''Tayleur'' left [[Liverpool]] on 19 January 1854, on her [[maiden voyage]], for [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], with a complement of 652 passengers and [[crewman|crew]]. She was mastered by 29-year-old Captain John Noble. During the inquiry, it was determined that her crew of 71 had only 37 trained seamen amongst them, and of these, ten could not speak [[English language|English]]. It was reported in newspaper accounts that many of the crew were seeking free passage to Australia. Most of the crew were able to survive.\n\nHer [[compass]]es did not work properly because of the [[iron]] [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]. The crew believed that they were sailing south through the [[Irish Sea]], but were actually travelling west towards [[Ireland]]. On 21 January 1854, within 48 hours of sailing, ''Tayleur'' found herself in a fog and a storm, heading straight for the [[Lambay Island|island of Lambay]]. The [[rudder]] was undersized for her [[tonnage]], so that she was unable to tack around the island. The rigging was also faulty; the ropes had not been properly stretched, so that they became slack, making it nearly impossible to control the sails. Despite dropping both anchors as soon as rocks were sighted, she ran aground on the east [[coast]] of Lambay Island, about five miles from [[Dublin Bay]].\n\nInitially, attempts were made to lower the ship's [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], but when the first one was smashed on the rocks, launching further boats was deemed unsafe. ''Tayleur'' was so close to land that the crew was able to collapse a mast onto the shore, and some people aboard were able to jump onto land by clambering along the collapsed mast. Some that reached shore had carried ropes from the ship, allowing others to pull themselves to safety on the ropes. Captain Noble waited on board ''Tayleur'' until the last minute, then jumped towards shore, being rescued by one of the passengers.\n\nWith the storm and high seas continuing, the ship was then washed into deeper water. She sank to the bottom with only the tops of her masts showing.\n\nA surviving passenger alerted the [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|coastguard]] station on the island. This passenger and four coast guards launched the coastguard galley. When they reached the wreck they found the last survivor, William Vivers, who had climbed to the tops of the rigging, and had spent 14 hours there. He was rescued by the coastguards. On 2 March 1854, George Finlay, the chief boatman, was awarded a silver medal for this rescue.<ref>{{cite web | title=RNLI Gallantry Medals | website=Coastguards of Yesteryear | url=http://www.coastguardsofyesteryear.org/articles.php?article_id=14 |  accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref>\n\nNewspaper accounts blamed the crew for negligence, but the official [[Coroner]]'s Inquest absolved Captain Noble and placed the blame on the ship's owners, accusing them of neglect for allowing the ship to depart without its compasses being properly adjusted. The [[Board of Trade]], however, did fault the captain for not taking soundings, a standard practice when sailing in low visibility.\nThe causes of the wreck were complex and included:\n* Compass problems due to the placing of an iron river steamer on the deck after the compasses had been swung. \n* Absence of a mast head compass placed at a distance from the iron hull. \n* Northerly current in the Irish sea similar to that which drove the Great Britain northward.  \n* Slotting effect of the wind in the sails driving the ship sideways. \n* Small untried crew to manage the sails.  \n* Large turning circle making ship unmaneuverable.  \n* The anchor chains broke when they were dropped in final efforts to save the ship.  \n* The captain had been injured in a serious fall and may have had head injuries.    \n* Lack of lifebelts - then uncommon and panic led to increased loss of life, those who kept their heads or could swim, escaped.\n\n''Tayleur'' has been compared with [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. They shared similarities in their separate times. Both were [[Royal Mail Ship|RMS]] ships and [[White Star Line]]rs (although these were different companies), and both went down on their maiden voyages. Inadequate or faulty equipment contributed to both disasters (faulty compasses and rigging for the ''Tayleur'', and lack of binoculars and life boats for the ''Titanic'').\n\n==Enquiries==\nThere were four official enquiries: The inquest, held at [[Malahide]]; The Board of Trade Inquiry under Captain Walker; The Admiralty investigation was held by Mr Grantham, Inspector of Iron Ships; The Liverpool Maritime Board tried the fitness of Captain Noble to command.  There are contradictions between these enquiries.\n\nNumbers of lives lost vary, as do the numbers given as to how many were on board. The latter are between 528 and 680, while the dead are supposed to be at least 297, and up to 380, depending on source. Out of over 100 women on board, only three survived, possibly because of the difficulty with the clothing of that era. The survivors were then faced with having to get up an almost sheer 80 foot (24m) cliff to get to shelter. When word of the disaster reached the Irish mainland, the [[City of Dublin Steam Packet Company]] sent the steamer ''Prince'' to look for survivors.  Recent research by Dr Edward J Bourke names 662 on board.<ref name=bourke>{{cite book|last1=Bourke|first1=Edward J.|title=Bound for Australia: The loss of the emigrant ship Tayleur at Lambay on the coast of Ireland|date=2003|publisher=Edward Bourke|location=Dublin|isbn=095230273X}}</ref>\n\nA memorial to those killed in the wreck was unveiled at [[Portrane]] (53.493441 -6.108558) on  16 May 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Tayleur Memorial, Portrane|url=http://irishseashipping.com/photofeatures/memorials/Eire/TayleurPortrane/tayleur.htm|website=Irish Sea Shipping|accessdate=2014-08-19|year=1999|last=Luxton|first=John}}</ref>\n\n== Diving ==\n[[File:\"Willow pattern\" dinner service recovered from the Tayleur.JPG|right|thumb|Display in the [[National Maritime Museum of Ireland]]]]The remains of the wreck were rediscovered in 1959 by members of the Irish Sub-Aqua Club.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Peter|title=Shipwrecks on the UK - Australia Run|url=http://oceans1.customer.netspace.net.au/austrun-main.html|website=Encyclopedia of Australian Shipwrecks|accessdate=2014-08-20}}</ref> Because the wreck is over 100 years old (166 as of 29 December 2019) a licence to dive the site must be obtained from the [[Office of Public Works]]. \n\nThe wreck lies at 17 metres depth some 30m off the southeast corner of Lambay Island in a small indentation. Substantial wreckage includes the hull, side plates, a [[Steam donkey|donkey engine]] and the lower mast. The woodwork  was salvaged shortly after the wreck.

Most of the crew were able to survive.\n\nHer [[compass]]es did not work properly because of the [[iron]] [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]. The crew believed that they were sailing south through the [[Irish Sea]], but were actually travelling west towards [[Ireland]]. On 21 January 1854, within 48 hours of sailing, ''Tayleur'' found herself in a fog and a storm, heading straight for the [[Lambay Island|island of Lambay]]. The [[rudder]] was undersized for her [[tonnage]], so that she was unable to tack around the island. The rigging was also faulty; the ropes had not been properly stretched, so that they became slack, making it nearly impossible to control the sails. Despite dropping both anchors as soon as rocks were sighted, she ran aground on the east [[coast]] of Lambay Island, about five miles from [[Dublin Bay]].\n\nInitially, attempts were made to lower the ship's [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]], but when the first one was smashed on the rocks, launching further boats was deemed unsafe. ''Tayleur'' was so close to land that the crew was able to collapse a mast onto the shore, and some people aboard were able to jump onto land by clambering along the collapsed mast. Some that reached shore had carried ropes from the ship, allowing others to pull themselves to safety on the ropes. Captain Noble waited on board ''Tayleur'' until the last minute, then jumped towards shore, being rescued by one of the passengers.\n\nWith the storm and high seas continuing, the ship was then washed into deeper water. She sank to the bottom with only the tops of her masts showing.\n\nA surviving passenger alerted the [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|coastguard]] station on the island. This passenger and four coast guards launched the coastguard galley. When they reached the wreck they found the last survivor, William Vivers, who had climbed to the tops of the rigging, and had spent 14 hours there. He was rescued by the coastguards. On 2 March 1854, George Finlay, the chief boatman, was awarded a silver medal for this rescue.<ref>{{cite web | title=RNLI Gallantry Medals | website=Coastguards of Yesteryear | url=http://www.coastguardsofyesteryear.org/articles.php?article_id=14 |  accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref>\n\nNewspaper accounts blamed the crew for negligence, but the official [[Coroner]]'s Inquest absolved Captain Noble and placed the blame on the ship's owners, accusing them of neglect for allowing the ship to depart without its compasses being properly adjusted. The [[Board of Trade]], however, did fault the captain for not taking soundings, a standard practice when sailing in low visibility.\nThe causes of the wreck were complex and included:\n* Compass problems due to the placing of an iron river steamer on the deck after the compasses had been swung. \n* Absence of a mast head compass placed at a distance from the iron hull. \n* Northerly current in the Irish sea similar to that which drove the Great Britain northward.  \n* Slotting effect of the wind in the sails driving the ship sideways. \n* Small untried crew to manage the sails.  \n* Large turning circle making ship unmaneuverable.  \n* The anchor chains broke when they were dropped in final efforts to save the ship.  \n* The captain had been injured in a serious fall and may have had head injuries.    \n* Lack of lifebelts - then uncommon and panic led to increased loss of life, those who kept their heads or could swim, escaped.\n\n''Tayleur'' has been compared with [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]. They shared similarities in their separate times. Both were [[Royal Mail Ship|RMS]] ships and [[White Star Line]]rs (although these were different companies), and both went down on their maiden voyages. Inadequate or faulty equipment contributed to both disasters (faulty compasses and rigging for the ''Tayleur'', and lack of binoculars and life boats for the ''Titanic'').\n\n==Enquiries==\nThere were four official enquiries: The inquest, held at [[Malahide]]; The Board of Trade Inquiry under Captain Walker; The Admiralty investigation was held by Mr Grantham, Inspector of Iron Ships; The Liverpool Maritime Board tried the fitness of Captain Noble to command.  There are contradictions between these enquiries.\n\nNumbers of lives lost vary, as do the numbers given as to how many were on board. The latter are between 528 and 680, while the dead are supposed to be at least 297, and up to 380, depending on source. Out of over 100 women on board, only three survived, possibly because of the difficulty with the clothing of that era. The survivors were then faced with having to get up an almost sheer 80 foot (24m) cliff to get to shelter. When word of the disaster reached the Irish mainland, the [[City of Dublin Steam Packet Company]] sent the steamer ''Prince'' to look for survivors.

{"title_page": "Nutrient", "text_new": "{{short description|Substance that an organism uses to live}}\n{{redirects|Nutrients|nutrition in humans|Human nutrition|nutrition in animals|Animal nutrition|nutrition in plants|Plant nutrition|the journal|Nutrients (journal)}}\nA '''nutrient''' is a [[Chemical substance|substance]] used by an organism to survive, grow, and reproduce. The requirement for dietary nutrient intake applies to [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s. Nutrients can be incorporated into cells for [[metabolism|metabolic purposes]] or [[excretion|excreted]] by cells to create non-cellular structures, such as [[hair]], [[scale (anatomy)|scales]], [[feather]]s, or [[exoskeleton]]s. Some nutrients can be metabolically converted to smaller molecules in the process of releasing energy, such as for [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]s, and [[fermentation]] products ([[ethanol]] or [[vinegar]]), leading to end-products of water and [[carbon dioxide]]. All organisms require water. Essential nutrients for animals are the energy sources, some of the [[amino acid]]s that are combined to create [[protein]]s, a subset of [[fatty acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s and certain [[mineral (nutrient)|minerals]]. Plants require more diverse minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed through leaves. [[fungus|Fungi]] live on dead or living organic matter and meet nutrient needs from their host.\n\nDifferent types of organism have different essential nutrients. Ascorbic acid ([[vitamin C]]) is essential, meaning it must be consumed in sufficient amounts, to humans and some other animal species, but not to all animals and not to plants, which are able to synthesize it. Nutrients may be [[organic compound|organic]] or inorganic: organic compounds include most compounds containing carbon, while all other chemicals are inorganic. Inorganic nutrients include nutrients such as [[iron]], [[selenium]], and [[zinc]], while organic nutrients include, among many others, energy-providing compounds and vitamins.\n\nA classification used primarily to describe nutrient needs of animals divides nutrients into [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] and [[micronutrient]]s. Consumed in relatively large amounts ([[gram]]s or [[ounce]]s), macronutrients ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, proteins, water) are used primarily to generate energy or to incorporate into tissues for growth and repair. Micronutrients are needed in smaller amounts ([[milligram]]s or [[microgram]]s); they have subtle [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[physiology|physiological]] roles in cellular processes, like [[vascular smooth muscle|vascular functions]] or [[action potential|nerve conduction]]. Inadequate amounts of essential nutrients, or diseases that interfere with absorption, result in a deficiency state that compromises growth, survival and reproduction. Consumer advisories for dietary nutrient intakes, such as the United States [[Dietary Reference Intake]], are based on deficiency outcomes{{clarify|date=January 2018}} and provide macronutrient and micronutrient guides for both lower and [[Tolerable upper intake levels|upper limits]] of intake. In many countries, macronutrients and micronutrients in significant content{{clarify|date=January 2018}} are required by regulations to be displayed on food product labels. Nutrients in larger quantities than the body needs may have harmful effects.<ref name=\"Ensminger1994\">{{cite book|author=Audrey H.

Water must be also consumed in large quantities.\n* [[Calcium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], and [[chloride]] ions, along with phosphorus and sulfur, are listed with [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] because they are required in large quantities compared to [[micronutrient]]s, i.e., vitamins and other minerals, the latter often described as trace or ultratrace minerals.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\nMacronutrients provide energy:\n\n* [[Carbohydrate]]s are compounds made up of types of [[sugar]]. Carbohydrates are classified according to their number of sugar units: [[monosaccharide]]s (such as [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]), [[disaccharide]]s (such as [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]), [[oligosaccharide]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s (such as [[starch]], [[glycogen]], and [[cellulose]]).\n* [[Protein]]s are [[organic compound]]s that consist of [[amino acid]]s joined by [[peptide bond]]s. Since the body cannot manufacture some of the [[amino acid]]s (termed [[essential amino acid]]s), the diet must supply them. Through digestion, [[protein]]s are [[protein catabolism|broken down]] by [[protease]]s back into free amino acids.\n* [[Fat]]s consist of a [[glycerin]] molecule with three [[fatty acid]]s attached. Fatty acid molecules contain a -COOH group attached to unbranched [[hydrocarbon]] chains connected by single bonds alone ([[Saturated fat|saturated fatty acids]]) or by both double and single bonds ([[Unsaturated fat|unsaturated fatty acids]]). Fats are needed for construction and maintenance of [[cell membrane]]s, to maintain a stable body temperature, and to sustain the health of skin and hair. Because the body does not manufacture certain fatty acids (termed [[essential fatty acid]]s), they must be obtained through one's diet.\n\nFat has an [[energy]] content of 9{{nbsp}}[[kcal]]/g (~37.7 kJ/g) and proteins and carbohydrates 4{{nbsp}}kcal/g (~16.7 kJ/g).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Micronutrients===\nMicronutrients support metabolism.\n\n* [[Dietary mineral]]s are generally trace elements, salts, or ions such as copper and iron.

The requirement for vitamin D is conditional, as people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, synthesize vitamin D in the skin.\n\n====Minerals====\n{{Main|Mineral (nutrient)}}\nMinerals are the [[exogenous]] [[chemical element]]s indispensable for life. Although the four elements: [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]], are essential for life, they are so plentiful in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino acids. [[Sulfur]] is essential, but again does not have a recommended intake. Instead, recommended intakes are identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine.\n\nThe essential nutrient elements for humans, listed in order of [[Reference Daily Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowance]] (expressed as a mass), are [[potassium]], [[chloride]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[copper]], [[iodine]], [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]] and [[cobalt]] (the last as a component of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>). There are other minerals which are essential for some plants and animals, but may or may not be essential for humans, such as [[boron]] and [[silicon]].\n\n===Conditionally essential nutrients===\nConditionally essential nutrients are certain organic molecules that can normally be synthesized by an organism, but under certain conditions in insufficient quantities.

The requirement for dietary nutrient intake applies to [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s. Nutrients can be incorporated into cells for [[metabolism|metabolic purposes]] or [[excretion|excreted]] by cells to create non-cellular structures, such as [[hair]], [[scale (anatomy)|scales]], [[feather]]s, or [[exoskeleton]]s. Some nutrients can be metabolically converted to smaller molecules in the process of releasing energy, such as for [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]s, and [[fermentation]] products ([[ethanol]] or [[vinegar]]), leading to end-products of water and [[carbon dioxide]]. All organisms require water. Essential nutrients for animals are the energy sources, some of the [[amino acid]]s that are combined to create [[protein]]s, a subset of [[fatty acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s and certain [[mineral (nutrient)|minerals]]. Plants require more diverse minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed through leaves. [[fungus|Fungi]] live on dead or living organic matter and meet nutrient needs from their host.\n\nDifferent types of organism have different essential nutrients. Ascorbic acid ([[vitamin C]]) is essential, meaning it must be consumed in sufficient amounts, to humans and some other animal species, but not to all animals and not to plants, which are able to synthesize it. Nutrients may be [[organic compound|organic]] or inorganic: organic compounds include most compounds containing carbon, while all other chemicals are inorganic. Inorganic nutrients include nutrients such as [[iron]], [[selenium]], and [[zinc]], while organic nutrients include, among many others, energy-providing compounds and vitamins.\n\nA classification used primarily to describe nutrient needs of animals divides nutrients into [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] and [[micronutrient]]s. Consumed in relatively large amounts ([[gram]]s or [[ounce]]s), macronutrients ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, proteins, water) are used primarily to generate energy or to incorporate into tissues for growth and repair. Micronutrients are needed in smaller amounts ([[milligram]]s or [[microgram]]s); they have subtle [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[physiology|physiological]] roles in cellular processes, like [[vascular smooth muscle|vascular functions]] or [[action potential|nerve conduction]]. Inadequate amounts of essential nutrients, or diseases that interfere with absorption, result in a deficiency state that compromises growth, survival and reproduction. Consumer advisories for dietary nutrient intakes, such as the United States [[Dietary Reference Intake]], are based on deficiency outcomes{{clarify|date=January 2018}} and provide macronutrient and micronutrient guides for both lower and [[Tolerable upper intake levels|upper limits]] of intake. In many countries, macronutrients and micronutrients in significant content{{clarify|date=January 2018}} are required by regulations to be displayed on food product labels.

Fats are needed for construction and maintenance of [[cell membrane]]s, to maintain a stable body temperature, and to sustain the health of skin and hair.

They commonly function as [[enzymatic cofactor]]s, metabolic regulators or [[antioxidant]]s. Humans require thirteen vitamins in their diet, most of which are actually groups of related molecules (e.g. [[vitamin E]] includes [[tocopherol]]s and [[tocotrienol]]s):<ref>{{cite journal | author = Brigelius-Floh\u00e9 R, Traber MG | title = Vitamin E: function and metabolism | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 1145\u20131155 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10385606 | last2 = Traber | doi=10.1096/fasebj.13.10.1145}}</ref> vitamins A, C, D, E, K, [[thiamine]] (B<sub>1</sub>), [[riboflavin]] (B<sub>2</sub>), [[niacin]] (B<sub>3</sub>), [[pantothenic acid]] (B<sub>5</sub>), [[Vitamin B6|vitamin B<sub>6</sub>]] (e.g., [[pyridoxine]]), [[biotin]] (B<sub>7</sub>), [[folate]] (B<sub>9</sub>), and [[cobalamin]] (B<sub>12</sub>). The requirement for vitamin D is conditional, as people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, synthesize vitamin D in the skin.\n\n====Minerals====\n{{Main|Mineral (nutrient)}}\nMinerals are the [[exogenous]] [[chemical element]]s indispensable for life. Although the four elements: [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]], are essential for life, they are so plentiful in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino acids. [[Sulfur]] is essential, but again does not have a recommended intake. Instead, recommended intakes are identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine.\n\nThe essential nutrient elements for humans, listed in order of [[Reference Daily Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowance]] (expressed as a mass), are [[potassium]], [[chloride]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[copper]], [[iodine]], [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]] and [[cobalt]] (the last as a component of vitamin B<sub>12</sub>). There are other minerals which are essential for some plants and animals, but may or may not be essential for humans, such as [[boron]] and [[silicon]].\n\n===Conditionally essential nutrients===\nConditionally essential nutrients are certain organic molecules that can normally be synthesized by an organism, but under certain conditions in insufficient quantities. In humans, such conditions include [[Preterm birth|premature birth]], limited nutrient intake, rapid growth, and certain disease states.<ref name=\"Carver\" /> [[Choline]], [[inositol]], [[taurine]], [[arginine]], [[glutamine]] and [[nucleotides]] are classified as conditionally essential and are particularly important in neonatal diet and metabolism.<ref name=\"Carver\" />\n\n=== Non-essential nutrients ===\nNon-essential nutrients are substances within foods that can have a significant impact on health.

loathsome [[twin]] [[cousin]] [[Gwen Tennyson|Gwen]] and their [[grandfather]] [[Max Tennyson|Max]]. On their first night camping in their grandfather's RV, Ben finds a mysterious watch-style device named the Omnitrix that attaches itself to his wrist, giving him the ability to transform into various alien life-forms. During their vacation, the Tennysons are attacked by various enemies, ranging from aliens such as [[cephalopod]]ic [[warlord]] [[Vilgax]], [[bounty hunter]] duo [[Sixsix]] and [[Kraab]], ghostly [[high king]] [[Zs'skayr]], to criminals such as 11-year-old [[juvenile delinquent|delinquent]] [[Kevin Levin]], [[mad scientist]] [[Doctor Animo]], mysterious [[paramilitary]] organization the [[Forever Knights]], and supernatural entities such as inter-dimensional [[Sorcerer (paranormal)|sorcerer]] [[Hex (Ben 10)|Hex]] and his niece [[Charmcaster]], and [[clown]] [[mastermind]] Zombozo and his Circus Freak Trio.\n\n===''Ben 10: Alien Force''===\n{{main|Ben 10: Alien Force}}\nThe series begins five years after the summer vacation when Ben discovered the Omnitrix. Ben removed the Omnitrix for because he lost the alien feedback shown in omniverse but regained it as a teenager while searching for his grandfather Max, who was abducted by a [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] alien species called the Highbreeds, who, along with the DNAliens at their command, are determined to [[Human extinction|cleanse the Earth of human beings]]. Ben's age causes the Omnitrix to reboot, granting him access to new alien forms, along with a few of his previous forms. Ben is joined by Gwen and former enemy Kevin Levin, as they fight the Highbreed's universal extermination plan.\n\n===''Ben 10: Ultimate Alien''===\n{{main|Ben 10: Ultimate Alien}}\nAfter Ben's last battle with Vilgax, which destroyed the Omnitrix, Ben replaces it with the new Ultimatrix that allows him to evolve his alien forms into their ultimate forms. With the recent disclosure of his identity, Ben has become a worldwide celebrity. Meanwhile, Ben, Gwen, and Kevin must stop an Osmosian villain named Aggregor, who hunts aliens from the Andromeda Galaxy and intends to use their powers to achieve the \"ultimate prize\". Later, Ben, Gwen, and Kevin have to prevent an extradimensional entity called Diagon from taking over the universe.\n\n===''Ben 10: Omniverse''===\n{{main|Ben 10: Omniverse}}\nBen acquires the brand new and improved powerful and perfect Omnitrix that gives him access to a new set of aliens along with all the forms he has assumed prior. After Gwen goes away to college with Kevin accompanying her, Ben pairs up with Rook Blonko, a plumber from the planet Revonnah. He is targeted by an intergalactic huntsman named Khyber, who made a copy of the Omnitrix, the Nemetrix, with the help of mad scientist Dr Psychobos. Both of them are working with an enemy from Ben's past, a Galvanic Mechamorph named Malware. Ben later contends with the Incurseans, Albedo, Zs'Skayr, Dr Psychobos, Charmcaster, the Plumber's Black-Ops Unit (called the \"Rooters\"), his alternate dimension self Mad Ben, and the Chronosapien Maltruant.\n\n===''Ben 10'' (2016 TV series)===\n{{Main|Ben 10 (2016 TV series)}}\nThe official Twitter feed of Cartoon Network PR<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CartoonNetPR/status/607903706730905601|title=CartoonNetworkPR on Twitter|publisher=}}</ref> confirmed a rebooted series that would return to following the adventures of Ben, Gwen, and Max Tennyson and feature new alien forms.

They are all [[wristwatch]]-styled devices developed by the [[Galvan]] inventor [[Azmuth]] that transforms the user into [[List of Ben 10 aliens|any one of many alien beings]] (originally 1,000,906, but the number has increased by 9 via scanning additional species not originally in the database). Despite many seeing the Omnitrix as a weapon, its true purpose was to allow the beings of the universe to understand each other and to resurrect intelligent species that may go extinct.\n\nThe Omnitrix appears in the first two incarnations of the franchise (''[[Ben 10 (2005 TV series)|Ben 10]]'' and ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]''), but Ben had to destroy it and use the Ultimatrix in the ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien|Ultimate Alien]]'' series. The Ultimatrix had most of the same functionality as the Omnitrix, but would allow the user to transform the alien into its Ultimate Form(how the species and its DNA would evolve in a one-million-year simulation). In the final episode of Ultimate Alien, Azmuth takes the Ultimatrix from Ben and replaces it with the New Omnitrix{{spaced ndash}}the original version has been a prototype.\n\nIn ''[[Ben 10: Omniverse]]'', the [[Ben 10: Omniverse#The Nemetrix|Nemetrix]], a knock-off of the original Omnitrix, is introduced. Unlike the Omnitrix and its succeeding models, the Nemetrix uses the DNA of the natural predators of sentient alien races which have the sole purpose of hunting Ben. Thus, only an animal can use the Nemetrix, as users of higher intelligence are unable to use it without incurring mental damage. In ''Omniverse'', Albedo recreates the Ultimatrix by using a Polymorphic Crystal to stabilize his transformations, making it so that he can stay in any form as long as he wants. It also allows him to transform into the Ultimate Forms of his aliens without first turning into their normal forms.\n\nIn ''[[Ben 10 (2016 TV series)|the Reboot series]]'', Ben's Omnitrix can augment enhancements onto his aliens. In Season 2, his aliens can become \"Omni-Enhanced\" with rock-like constructs and energy. However, the enhancements seems to happen at random. This energy is later revealed to be coming from a new alien species in his Omnitrix, which eventually gets its own form, \"Shock Rock\". In Season 4, Ben unlocks the \"Omni-Kix\" feature, which allows him to add armor plating onto his aliens. \nThe Reboot series also introduces the AntiTrix, which is wielded by Kevin Levin. The AntiTrix allows Kevin to transform into 11 aliens, most of which are ones that Ben has used before, but significantly altered from Ben's version.\n\n===Plumbers===\nThe '''Plumbers''' is an organization composed of both human and alien members, each of whom possesses a special badge. All badges bear the intergalactic peace symbol, a green [[hourglass]] shape, which is on the faceplate of the Omnitrix. Later, in ''Omniverse'', the Plumbers' symbol becomes a red dot.\n\nIn the original series, the Earth's Plumbers were a secret government organization that protected the universe from any threat. Their main base is located inside [[Mount Rushmore]] (where the Null Void projector and Sub-Energy were stored), with additional bases located inside [[Fort Knox]], the [[Space Needle]], [[Devils Tower]], the [[Navajo National Monument|Navajo Monument]], the [[Great Dismal Swamp]], and major cities such as [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]], [[New York City]], [[New Orleans]], [[Denver]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Orlando]], and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]. Their main adversary was Vilgax. [[Max Tennyson]] was a Plumber in his youth. Most of the Plumbers on Earth have disbanded; however, a few members remain in a semi-active capacity.\n\n===Forever Knights===\nThe '''Forever Knights''' are a secret British society first formed during the [[Middle Ages]] that are dedicated to collecting and studying alien technology, usually by illegal means. Any aliens they capture along the way are dissected and studied, and any humans caught with them are deemed worthless and disposed of. They also have a robotic dragon that protects one of their castles. It is revealed in ''Ultimate Alien'' that the reason for their actions is to combat Diagon, an entity from another dimension that nearly conquered the Earth in the Middle Ages were it not for the Forever Knights' immortal Founder George. When George left them, the Forever Knights began to splinter under various self-titled Forever Kings who transformed their knights' duty into a [[Speciesism#In the media|genocidal policy toward anything alien]].\n\n===Transports===\nEach series has featured some kind of main transportation. The wheeled motor vehicles, appearing like normal cars, are equipped with several pieces of Plumber technology such as a turbo engine, laser guns, and [[autopilot]]. They are often destroyed during the series.\n\nThe '''Rustbucket''' and the '''Rustbucket II''', is an old [[recreational vehicle|RV]] resembling a 1973 [[GMC motorhome]] owned by Max Tennyson. Despite being old, and even having been destroyed a few times, Max has great affection for it.\n\nThe '''Resolute''' is Tetrax Shard's spaceship\n\nThe '''Chimearan Hammer''' is Vilgax's spaceship\n\n'''[[List of Ben 10 characters#Ship|Ship]]''' is a Galvanic Mechamorph (Upgrade's species) that can transform himself into fully operational technology he's once touched. He merged with the Forever Knights spaceship and became the space transportation for Ben's team during the third season of ''Alien Force''. \n\nThe '''Rustbucket III''', a Plumbers' [[jet aircraft|jet]] that Kevin has upgraded with alien tech, later replaced him.\n\n'''Kevin's car''' is a [[Muscle car]] resembling a [[Dodge Challenger]] armed with Plumber technology as well as other various alien techs, including guns and off-road capabilities. It is the team's main transport in ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force|Alien Force]]'' and ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien|Ultimate Alien]]''. It is damaged or destroyed often, mainly during fights or chase scenes, and Kevin is constantly busy repairing it. In Omniverse, after Ben destroyed it while aiming at Upgrade, Kevin gave it a new look. He painted it blue and placed a white circle with the number 11 on it, with only one stripe.\n\nThe '''Proto-TRUK''' is Rook's spaceship and the team's main transport in ''[[Ben 10: Omniverse|Omniverse]]''. It can transform into a small truck to camouflage itself among Earth vehicles. It was later destroyed and its parts were used by Ben 10,000 to build the Time Cycles.\n\n==Accolades==\n\n===Original series===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! Year\n!

They are all [[wristwatch]]-styled devices developed by the [[Galvan]] inventor [[Azmuth]] that transforms the user into [[List of Ben 10 aliens|any one of many alien beings]] (originally 1,000,906, but the number has increased by 9 via scanning additional species not originally in the database). Despite many seeing the Omnitrix as a weapon, its true purpose was to allow the beings of the universe to understand each other and to resurrect intelligent species that may go extinct.\n\nThe Omnitrix appears in the first two incarnations of the franchise (''[[Ben 10 (2005 TV series)|Ben 10]]'' and ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]''), but Ben had to destroy it and use the Ultimatrix in the ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien|Ultimate Alien]]'' series. The Ultimatrix had most of the same functionality as the Omnitrix, but would allow the user to transform the alien into its Ultimate Form(how the species and its DNA would evolve in a one-million-year simulation). In the final episode of Ultimate Alien, Azmuth takes the Ultimatrix from Ben and replaces it with the New Omnitrix{{spaced ndash}}the original version has been a prototype.\n\nIn ''[[Ben 10: Omniverse]]'', the [[Ben 10: Omniverse#The Nemetrix|Nemetrix]], a knock-off of the original Omnitrix, is introduced. Unlike the Omnitrix and its succeeding models, the Nemetrix uses the DNA of the natural predators of sentient alien races which have the sole purpose of hunting Ben. Thus, only an animal can use the Nemetrix, as users of higher intelligence are unable to use it without incurring mental damage. In ''Omniverse'', Albedo recreates the Ultimatrix by using a Polymorphic Crystal to stabilize his transformations, making it so that he can stay in any form as long as he wants. It also allows him to transform into the Ultimate Forms of his aliens without first turning into their normal forms.\n\nIn ''[[Ben 10 (2016 TV series)|the Reboot series]]'', Ben's Omnitrix can augment enhancements onto his aliens. In Season 2, his aliens can become \"Omni-Enhanced\" with rock-like constructs and energy. However, the enhancements seems to happen at random. This energy is later revealed to be coming from a new alien species in his Omnitrix, which eventually gets its own form, \"Shock Rock\". In Season 4, Ben unlocks the \"Omni-Kix\" feature, which allows him to add armor plating onto his aliens. \nThe Reboot series also introduces the AntiTrix, which is wielded by Kevin Levin. The AntiTrix allows Kevin to transform into 11 aliens, most of which are ones that Ben has used before, but significantly altered from Ben's version.\n\n===Plumbers===\nThe '''Plumbers''' is an organization composed of both human and alien members, each of whom possesses a special badge. All badges bear the intergalactic peace symbol, a green [[hourglass]] shape, which is on the faceplate of the Omnitrix. Later, in ''Omniverse'', the Plumbers' symbol becomes a red dot.\n\nIn the original series, the Earth's Plumbers were a secret government organization that protected the universe from any threat. Their main base is located inside [[Mount Rushmore]] (where the Null Void projector and Sub-Energy were stored), with additional bases located inside [[Fort Knox]], the [[Space Needle]], [[Devils Tower]], the [[Navajo National Monument|Navajo Monument]], the [[Great Dismal Swamp]], and major cities such as [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]], [[New York City]], [[New Orleans]], [[Denver]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Orlando]], and [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]. Their main adversary was Vilgax. [[Max Tennyson]] was a Plumber in his youth. Most of the Plumbers on Earth have disbanded; however, a few members remain in a semi-active capacity.\n\n===Forever Knights===\nThe '''Forever Knights''' are a secret British society first formed during the [[Middle Ages]] that are dedicated to collecting and studying alien technology, usually by illegal means. Any aliens they capture along the way are dissected and studied, and any humans caught with them are deemed worthless and disposed of. They also have a robotic dragon that protects one of their castles. It is revealed in ''Ultimate Alien'' that the reason for their actions is to combat Diagon, an entity from another dimension that nearly conquered the Earth in the Middle Ages were it not for the Forever Knights' immortal Founder George. When George left them, the Forever Knights began to splinter under various self-titled Forever Kings who transformed their knights' duty into a [[Speciesism#In the media|genocidal policy toward anything alien]].\n\n===Transports===\nEach series has featured some kind of main transportation. The wheeled motor vehicles, appearing like normal cars, are equipped with several pieces of Plumber technology such as a turbo engine, laser guns, and [[autopilot]]. They are often destroyed during the series.\n\nThe '''Rustbucket''' and the '''Rustbucket II''', is an old [[recreational vehicle|RV]] resembling a 1973 [[GMC motorhome]] owned by Max Tennyson. Despite being old, and even having been destroyed a few times, Max has great affection for it.\n\nThe '''Resolute''' is Tetrax Shard's spaceship\n\nThe '''Chimearan Hammer''' is Vilgax's spaceship\n\n'''[[List of Ben 10 characters#Ship|Ship]]''' is a Galvanic Mechamorph (Upgrade's species) that can transform himself into fully operational technology he's once touched. He merged with the Forever Knights spaceship and became the space transportation for Ben's team during the third season of ''Alien Force''. \n\nThe '''Rustbucket III''', a Plumbers' [[jet aircraft|jet]] that Kevin has upgraded with alien tech, later replaced him.\n\n'''Kevin's car''' is a [[Muscle car]] resembling a [[Dodge Challenger]] armed with Plumber technology as well as other various alien techs, including guns and off-road capabilities. It is the team's main transport in ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force|Alien Force]]'' and ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien|Ultimate Alien]]''. It is damaged or destroyed often, mainly during fights or chase scenes, and Kevin is constantly busy repairing it. In Omniverse, after Ben destroyed it while aiming at Upgrade, Kevin gave it a new look. He painted it blue and placed a white circle with the number 11 on it, with only one stripe.\n\nThe '''Proto-TRUK''' is Rook's spaceship and the team's main transport in ''[[Ben 10: Omniverse|Omniverse]]''. It can transform into a small truck to camouflage itself among Earth vehicles. It was later destroyed and its parts were used by Ben 10,000 to build the Time Cycles.\n\n==Accolades==\n\n===Original series===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! Year\n!

He also used the Omnitrix to become an alien with the mix of Diamondhead, Chromastone, and Way Big to smash a cowboy.\n* In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode \"[[You're Getting Old]]\", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]'s Mother mentions that Cartman gets upset when he does not get a present every time someone else gets a present at a party. One of the presents Cartman gets is a \"Ben 10 Wrist Rocket\".\n* The ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"Hurtled from a Helicopter into a Speeding Train\" shows Ben on his 14th birthday party, where he complains about his gifts given by Azmuth.\n* ''Ben 10'' villains, such as the Enoch, Hex and Animo, make a brief cameo in ''[[The Secret Saturdays]]'' episode \"Van Rook's Apprentice\". References to Galvan Prime and Wildvine's species also appear in \"Guess Who's Going to be Dinner?\" and \"Eterno\" respectively. Both references were made by the Secret Scientist Dr Arthur Beeman, the UFOlogist for the series.\t\n* In the ''[[Peep Show (British TV series)|Peep Show]]'' episode, \"Man Jam\", Jeremy jokingly refers to Ben, the boyfriend of a woman he admires, as \"Ben 10\" during a phone call to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/peep-show/on-demand/47548-002|title=Peep Show - On-Demand - All 4|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Cartoon Network promotion===\n\n====''Titanic Kungfubot Offensive''====\nThe game features famous and notable Cartoon Network characters in robot-type form.

Throughout his club career, he played for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], [[Sydney FC|Sydney]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], mainly as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]], between 1988 and 2009. He was the assistant manager of the [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago national team]] until the completion of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CONCACAF Fourth Round|qualifying matches for the 2010 FIFA World Cup]]. Yorke scored 123 goals in the [[Premier League]], a record for a non-European which was not broken until [[Sergio Ag\u00fcero]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41133350|title=Manchester City 5-0 Liverpool|publisher=BBC Sport|date=9 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt international level, Yorke represented Trinidad and Tobago on 74 occasions between 1989 and 2009, scoring 19 goals. He helped his nation reach the semi-finals of the [[2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], and also helped Trinidad and Tobago to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup]] for the first time in its history, later representing his national side in the final tournament in 2006.\n\n==Club career==\n===Aston Villa===\nYorke was first discovered by [[Graham Taylor]], at the time the [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] manager, on a tour of the West Indies in 1989. Yorke appeared in a team that played a friendly match against Aston Villa, Taylor was impressed and offered Yorke a trial at Villa. Yorke was subsequently given a permanent contract and he made his [[Football League First Division|First Division]] debut for Aston Villa against Crystal Palace on 24 March 1990: Crystal Palace won the game 1\u20130. During his time with Aston Villa, from 1989 to 1998, Yorke played initially as a right winger until the [[1995\u201396 FA Premier League|1995\u201396 season]], he then switched to [[Forward (association football)|centre forward]] and quickly established himself as one of the [[Premier League]]'s top strikers.\n\nYorke was an integral member of the Villa team that reached the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] Final in 1996. Villa won 3\u20130 against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] with Yorke getting on the scoresheet. On 30 September 1996 he scored a hat-trick against Newcastle United in a 4\u20133 defeat. Newcastle were leading 3\u20131 at half-time and Aston Villa were down to ten men, with [[Mark Draper]] being [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] late in the first half. Yorke showed great character in leading his team in a brave fight back by scoring two more goals in the second half to complete his hat-trick, although it was to no avail as Aston Villa still lost the game. Yorke thought he had scored a fourth goal to equalise the game at 4\u20134, only for it to be ruled offside. It was performances like this that led to interest from Manchester United in August 1998. Yorke appeared for Aston Villa on 284 occasions, scoring 97 times. He also has the distinct honour of being the last ever Villa player to score in front of the old Holte End standing terrace, notching both goals in a 2\u20131 victory on the final day of the 1993\u201394 season, 7 May 1994.\n\nThe circumstances of his departure from Aston Villa were controversial. John Gregory, Aston Villa manager at that time, made it known that the club did not want to sell Yorke to Manchester United unless they were prepared to exchange striker [[Andy Cole]]. Yorke then approached Gregory to state that he wanted to leave the club, to which Gregory was later attributed as saying that he would have shot Yorke if he had had a gun in his office. Yorke played for Villa on the opening day of the season at Everton on 15 August 1998, however it appeared he made no effort during the match as he was unhappy at not being allowed to leave the club. Villa were left with no option but to sell the player and he was transferred to Manchester United for \u00a312.6&nbsp;million on 20 August 1998.<ref>http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/features/on-this-day-20-aug-1998-dwight-yorke-joins-manchester-united-from-aston-villa.html</ref> \n\n===Manchester United===\nIn his first season Yorke was a key player in guiding his club to a unique treble of the Premier League title, [[FA Cup]] and [[UEFA Champions League]], and forming a legendary partnership with [[Andrew Cole|Andy Cole]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/apr/24/joy-of-six-strike-partnerships |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=The Joy of Six: great strike partnerships |first=Scott |last=Murray |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref> Yorke finished the season as the top league goalscorer with 18 goals and contributed goals against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Thorpe |title=Inter are Yorked by United |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/mar/03/newsstory.sport19 |publisher=The Guardian |date=3 March 1999 |accessdate=10 August 2014 }}</ref> and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the Champions League, and he won the [[Premier League Player of the Season]].

He scored the first goal for Sydney FC in its first A-League regular season match, a diving header against the [[Melbourne Victory]]. Yorke came to Sydney FC with the biggest pedigree of all players in the A-League, having won the [[Treble (association football)|treble]] with Manchester United. Yorke scored 7 goals in the A-League, with three of them being from [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kicks]]. Sydney FC coach [[Pierre Littbarski]] moved Yorke into a midfield role and gave him the team captaincy.\n\nHe played a major role in leading Sydney FC to victory in the inaugural A-League Grand Final on 5 March against regional rivals [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]]. He set up the only goal, scored by [[Steve Corica]], in front of a sell out crowd of over 41,000 at [[Aussie Stadium]], and was awarded the [[Joe Marston Medal]] as best player in the grand final. Yorke was the [[A-League#Marquee player|marquee player]] for Sydney FC \u2013 meaning that his salary fell outside the salary cap. He was also a star name for the A-League as a whole. Aside from his footballing talents, the drawing power and credibility he brought both locally and internationally proved to be beneficial for the competition in its inaugural season, leading the [[Football Federation Australia|FFA]] to use his image and name for the promotion of the A-League's second season.\n\nDue to the schedule of football in Australia, Yorke returned to Manchester United for training from March to June 2006, to retain fitness for the World Cup.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Anstead |first1=Mike |title=Ferguson lends Yorke a hand to arm the Warriors |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/feb/28/newsstory.sport3 |accessdate=22 April 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=28 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nYorke returned to Sydney FC to take part in a friendly against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2010.

Throughout his club career, he played for [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], [[Sydney FC|Sydney]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], mainly as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]], between 1988 and 2009. He was the assistant manager of the [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago national team]] until the completion of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CONCACAF Fourth Round|qualifying matches for the 2010 FIFA World Cup]]. Yorke scored 123 goals in the [[Premier League]], a record for a non-European which was not broken until [[Sergio Ag\u00fcero]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41133350|title=Manchester City 5-0 Liverpool|publisher=BBC Sport|date=9 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt international level, Yorke represented Trinidad and Tobago on 74 occasions between 1989 and 2009, scoring 19 goals. He helped his nation reach the semi-finals of the [[2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], and also helped Trinidad and Tobago to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup]] for the first time in its history, later representing his national side in the final tournament in 2006.\n\n==Club career==\n===Aston Villa===\nYorke was first discovered by [[Graham Taylor]], at the time the [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] manager, on a tour of the West Indies in 1989. Yorke appeared in a team that played a friendly match against Aston Villa, Taylor was impressed and offered Yorke a trial at Villa. Yorke was subsequently given a permanent contract and he made his [[Football League First Division|First Division]] debut for Aston Villa against Crystal Palace on 24 March 1990: Crystal Palace won the game 1\u20130. During his time with Aston Villa, from 1989 to 1998, Yorke played initially as a right winger until the [[1995\u201396 FA Premier League|1995\u201396 season]], he then switched to [[Forward (association football)|centre forward]] and quickly established himself as one of the [[Premier League]]'s top strikers.\n\nYorke was an integral member of the Villa team that reached the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] Final in 1996. Villa won 3\u20130 against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] with Yorke getting on the scoresheet. On 30 September 1996 he scored a hat-trick against Newcastle United in a 4\u20133 defeat. Newcastle were leading 3\u20131 at half-time and Aston Villa were down to ten men, with [[Mark Draper]] being [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]] late in the first half. Yorke showed great character in leading his team in a brave fight back by scoring two more goals in the second half to complete his hat-trick, although it was to no avail as Aston Villa still lost the game. Yorke thought he had scored a fourth goal to equalise the game at 4\u20134, only for it to be ruled offside. It was performances like this that led to interest from Manchester United in August 1998. Yorke appeared for Aston Villa on 284 occasions, scoring 97 times. He also has the distinct honour of being the last ever Villa player to score in front of the old Holte End standing terrace, notching both goals in a 2\u20131 victory on the final day of the 1993\u201394 season, 7 May 1994.\n\nThe circumstances of his departure from Aston Villa were controversial. John Gregory, Aston Villa manager at that time, made it known that the club did not want to sell Yorke to Manchester United unless they were prepared to exchange striker [[Andy Cole]]. Yorke then approached Gregory to state that he wanted to leave the club, to which Gregory was later attributed as saying that he would have shot Yorke if he had had a gun in his office. Yorke played for Villa on the opening day of the season at Everton on 15 August 1998, however it appeared he made no effort during the match as he was unhappy at not being allowed to leave the club. Villa were left with no option but to sell the player and he was transferred to Manchester United for \u00a312.6&nbsp;million on 20 August 1998.<ref>http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/features/on-this-day-20-aug-1998-dwight-yorke-joins-manchester-united-from-aston-villa.html</ref> \n\n===Manchester United===\nIn his first season Yorke was a key player in guiding his club to a unique treble of the Premier League title, [[FA Cup]] and [[UEFA Champions League]], and forming a legendary partnership with [[Andrew Cole|Andy Cole]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/apr/24/joy-of-six-strike-partnerships |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=The Joy of Six: great strike partnerships |first=Scott |last=Murray |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref> Yorke finished the season as the top league goalscorer with 18 goals and contributed goals against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Thorpe |title=Inter are Yorked by United |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/mar/03/newsstory.sport19 |publisher=The Guardian |date=3 March 1999 |accessdate=10 August 2014 }}</ref> and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the Champions League, and he won the [[Premier League Player of the Season]].

He scored the first goal for Sydney FC in its first A-League regular season match, a diving header against the [[Melbourne Victory]]. Yorke came to Sydney FC with the biggest pedigree of all players in the A-League, having won the [[Treble (association football)|treble]] with Manchester United. Yorke scored 7 goals in the A-League, with three of them being from [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kicks]]. Sydney FC coach [[Pierre Littbarski]] moved Yorke into a midfield role and gave him the team captaincy.\n\nHe played a major role in leading Sydney FC to victory in the inaugural A-League Grand Final on 5 March against regional rivals [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]]. He set up the only goal, scored by [[Steve Corica]], in front of a sell out crowd of over 41,000 at [[Aussie Stadium]], and was awarded the [[Joe Marston Medal]] as best player in the grand final. Yorke was the [[A-League#Marquee player|marquee player]] for Sydney FC \u2013 meaning that his salary fell outside the salary cap. He was also a star name for the A-League as a whole. Aside from his footballing talents, the drawing power and credibility he brought both locally and internationally proved to be beneficial for the competition in its inaugural season, leading the [[Football Federation Australia|FFA]] to use his image and name for the promotion of the A-League's second season.\n\nDue to the schedule of football in Australia, Yorke returned to Manchester United for training from March to June 2006, to retain fitness for the World Cup.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Anstead |first1=Mike |title=Ferguson lends Yorke a hand to arm the Warriors |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/feb/28/newsstory.sport3 |accessdate=22 April 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=28 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nYorke returned to Sydney FC to take part in a friendly against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2010.
