It connects several suburbs of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], including [[Tolleson, Arizona|Tolleson]], [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], [[Peoria, Arizona|Peoria]],  [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], and [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]].  Construction began in the late-1980s and was completed in 2001.\nAdditional general purpose lanes and a [[high occupancy vehicle lane]] (HOV) are being constructed along the eastern stretch of Loop 101 from [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]] to [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]], starting at Princess Drive to [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]] (the Santan Freeway).\n\nLoop 101 has [[stack interchange|interchanges]] with almost all [[Metropolitan Phoenix Freeways|area freeways]], including: [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]], [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|US&nbsp;60]], [[Arizona State Route 51|SR&nbsp;51]], [[Interstate 17]], and [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|Interstate 10]] along its 61-mile (98&nbsp;km) route.\n\nLoop 101 has various names along its route:\n* '''Agua Fria Freeway''' in the west valley from [[Papago Freeway|I-10]] to [[Black Canyon Freeway|I-17]]\n* '''Pima Freeway''' in the east valley from [[Black Canyon Freeway|I-17]] to [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]]'s Red Mountain Freeway\n* '''Price Freeway''' from [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]]'s Red Mountain Freeway to [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]]'s Santan Freeway\n\n==Route description==\nLoop 101 begins as the Agua Fria Freeway west of Phoenix in [[Tolleson, Arizona|Tolleson]] at a three-level [[interchange (road)|interchange]] with [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|Interstate 10]].  From that point, it heads north entering Phoenix then Glendale, passing [[State Farm Stadium]] and [[Gila River Arena]].  Continuing northward through Peoria, it passes the [[Peoria Sports Complex]] before entering northwestern Glendale and heading east just past the [[Arrowhead Towne Center]] mall. Loop 101 now heads eastward on the Beardsley Road alignment. The freeway enters northern Phoenix, and at [[milepost]] 23, Loop 101 intersects [[Interstate 17]] near the [[Deer Valley Airport]], {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of [[Downtown Phoenix]].\n\nContinuing east as the Pima Freeway, it passes through the Union Hills area and then has an interchange with the northern terminus of [[State Route 51 (Arizona)|SR 51]] at milepost 29.  East of its junction with SR 51, Loop 101 curves south through [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]] in the northeast [[Valley of the Sun|valley]] on the Pima Road alignment.  The freeway curves east and continues onto the [[Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community]] just south of Via Linda providing access to Downtown Scottsdale, a large open-air [[Power center (retail)|power center]] called Scottsdale Pavilions, [[Scottsdale Community College]], two [[casino]]s, and [[Scottsdale Fashion Square]]. Continuing south, Loop 101 encounters an interchange with the Red Mountain Freeway portion of [[State Route 202 (Arizona)|Loop 202]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] at milepost 51, near the campus of [[Arizona State University]]. This interchange is partially built over the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]].\n\nAfter this interchange, Loop 101 is now the Price Freeway, and interchanges with [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|US 60]] at milepost 55 before entering [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]]. Loop 101 provides access to [[Chandler Fashion Center]] just prior to concluding at milepost 61 at an interchange with the Santan Freeway portion of [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]].<ref>{{google maps |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&saddr=33.29366,-111.89352&daddr=AZ-101+W+to:AZ-101+W+to:Unknown+road&hl=en&geocode=%3BFY6HAQId2GtU-Q%3BFc66AQIdys5P-Q%3BFXWd_gEd7OlO-Q&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=0&sz=13&via=1,2&sll=33.306716,-111.91309&sspn=0.072163,0.153809&ie=UTF8&ll=33.458943,-111.968536&spn=0.576287,1.230469&z=10 |accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Old Arizona Loop 101.svg|thumb|right|100px|Old colored Arizona Loop 101 shield that has been phased out.]]The highway originally was assigned two different route numbers along its path.

The photo enforcement was based on inductive sheeting on the [[freeway]] bed located at six fixed positions along the freeway - three in each direction. The photo enforcement was in a trial phase, with the trial ending in December 2006.

It connects several suburbs of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], including [[Tolleson, Arizona|Tolleson]], [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], [[Peoria, Arizona|Peoria]],  [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], and [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]].  Construction began in the late-1980s and was completed in 2001.\nAdditional general purpose lanes and a [[high occupancy vehicle lane]] (HOV) are being constructed along the eastern stretch of Loop 101 from [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]] to [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]], starting at Princess Drive to [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]] (the Santan Freeway).\n\nLoop 101 has [[stack interchange|interchanges]] with almost all [[Metropolitan Phoenix Freeways|area freeways]], including: [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]], [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|US&nbsp;60]], [[Arizona State Route 51|SR&nbsp;51]], [[Interstate 17]], and [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|Interstate 10]] along its 61-mile (98&nbsp;km) route.\n\nLoop 101 has various names along its route:\n* '''Agua Fria Freeway''' in the west valley from [[Papago Freeway|I-10]] to [[Black Canyon Freeway|I-17]]\n* '''Pima Freeway''' in the east valley from [[Black Canyon Freeway|I-17]] to [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]]'s Red Mountain Freeway\n* '''Price Freeway''' from [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]]'s Red Mountain Freeway to [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]]'s Santan Freeway\n\n==Route description==\nLoop 101 begins as the Agua Fria Freeway west of Phoenix in [[Tolleson, Arizona|Tolleson]] at a three-level [[interchange (road)|interchange]] with [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|Interstate 10]].  From that point, it heads north entering Phoenix then Glendale, passing [[State Farm Stadium]] and [[Gila River Arena]].  Continuing northward through Peoria, it passes the [[Peoria Sports Complex]] before entering northwestern Glendale and heading east just past the [[Arrowhead Towne Center]] mall. Loop 101 now heads eastward on the Beardsley Road alignment. The freeway enters northern Phoenix, and at [[milepost]] 23, Loop 101 intersects [[Interstate 17]] near the [[Deer Valley Airport]], {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of [[Downtown Phoenix]].\n\nContinuing east as the Pima Freeway, it passes through the Union Hills area and then has an interchange with the northern terminus of [[State Route 51 (Arizona)|SR 51]] at milepost 29.  East of its junction with SR 51, Loop 101 curves south through [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]] in the northeast [[Valley of the Sun|valley]] on the Pima Road alignment.  The freeway curves east and continues onto the [[Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community]] just south of Via Linda providing access to Downtown Scottsdale, a large open-air [[Power center (retail)|power center]] called Scottsdale Pavilions, [[Scottsdale Community College]], two [[casino]]s, and [[Scottsdale Fashion Square]]. Continuing south, Loop 101 encounters an interchange with the Red Mountain Freeway portion of [[State Route 202 (Arizona)|Loop 202]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] at milepost 51, near the campus of [[Arizona State University]]. This interchange is partially built over the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]].\n\nAfter this interchange, Loop 101 is now the Price Freeway, and interchanges with [[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|US 60]] at milepost 55 before entering [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]]. Loop 101 provides access to [[Chandler Fashion Center]] just prior to concluding at milepost 61 at an interchange with the Santan Freeway portion of [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]].<ref>{{google maps |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&saddr=33.29366,-111.89352&daddr=AZ-101+W+to:AZ-101+W+to:Unknown+road&hl=en&geocode=%3BFY6HAQId2GtU-Q%3BFc66AQIdys5P-Q%3BFXWd_gEd7OlO-Q&mra=dme&mrcr=0&mrsp=0&sz=13&via=1,2&sll=33.306716,-111.91309&sspn=0.072163,0.153809&ie=UTF8&ll=33.458943,-111.968536&spn=0.576287,1.230469&z=10 |accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Old Arizona Loop 101.svg|thumb|right|100px|Old colored Arizona Loop 101 shield that has been phased out.]]The highway originally was assigned two different route numbers along its path.

Its roots predominantly lay in Roman law and the ''[[Jus commune|ius commune]]'', however feudalism was also introduced into Scots property law as a result of the [[Davidian Revolution]] in the 12th century.  By the 17th and 18th century, a group of academics, now called the [[Scots law|institutional writers,]] wrote authoritative texts on large areas of Scots law, including property law, which came to be regarded as a formal [[Sources of law|source of law]] from the 19th century onwards. \n\nFollowing the [[Acts of Union 1707]], [[Scots law#Private law|Scots Law]] and its courts, such as the [[Court of Session]], continued to operate as a separate legal system under the terms of Article XIX (19) of the [[Treaty of Union]] and the jurisdiction retained its independence following the creation of subsequent United Kingdom states in [[Parliament of Great Britain|1800]] and [[United Kingdom|1922]],  although Scots law was subject to modification by Acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and latterly, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], and from judgments of the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] in appeals from the Court of Session.\n\nToday, Scots property law is part of Scots private law and as such is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] competence of the [[Scottish Parliament]] under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]<ref>[[Scotland Act 1998]] s.126.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/12506.aspx|title=What are the powers of the Scottish Parliament?|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The Scottish Parliament has introduced key pieces of legislation in relating to property law: notably the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000]] and the [[Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012]]. However, large areas of Scots property law still remain governed by pre-existing legal authority predating the creation of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999. so its '''current''' [[sources of law]] include: \n\n* The works of the [[Scots law#Academic writings|Institutional Writers]].\n*[[Common law]] decisions of the Scottish courts, including [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judgments of the House of Lords]] (and its successor, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]), in civil appeals from the Court of Session.\n*[[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland]].\n*[[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of the Parliaments of the United Kingdoms]].\n*[[Act of the Scottish Parliament|Acts of the Scottish Parliament.]]\n\n== Real Rights in Scots Property Law  ==\n\n=== Personal Rights and Real Rights ===\nA fundamental distinction in Scots law is that of '''personal rights''' and '''real rights,''' which follows the [[Roman law]] classification of rights falling into either of two categories:  a ''jus in personam'' or a ''jus in rem'', which the works of Barry Nicholas describes as: \n\n\"Any claim is either i''n rem'' or ''in personam'', and there is an unbridgeable division between them. '''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights ''in rem'' and rights ''in personam.'' Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref> \n\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of the defender committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care), with the result is the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') brings to a Scottish court an action against an individual. A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> Accordingly, within Scots Private law, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.<ref>See Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref>\n\n=== ''Numerus Clausus''===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights which follows the legal principle, shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B. Akkermans, ''The Principle of Numerus Clausus in European Property Law'' (Intersentia, 2008) vol 75, 75.</ref> that only real rights within the ''numerus clausus'' (closed number) are competent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swadling|first=William|date=2000|title='Opening the numerus clausus'|url=|journal=Law Quarterly Review|volume=116|pages=354|via=}}</ref> Without the valid creation of a recognised real right, an individual only holds a personal right against another. This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''numerus clausus'' is explained in a Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B. Edgeworth, 'The Numerus Clausus Principle in Contemporary Australian Property Law' (2006) 32 Monash U L Rev 387, 387.</ref> \n\nIn Scots property law, the real rights falling within the ''numerus clausus'' have never been formally codified, but it is considered that the primary real right is [[Ownership in Scots Law|ownership]] and subordinate to ownership are the lesser real rights<ref>''Erskine'' II,1,1, 'inferior real rights'.

There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property, ('''eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.''');''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property, which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult, such as where moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to land. In this situation, the rules of [[Accession (property law)|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland. \n\nAll property in Scots law belongs to one of each class, the result is four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own unique [[Transfer of property in Scots law|rules of transfer]], these are:\n\n* Corporeal heritable property\n* Corporeal moveable property\n* Incorporeal moveable property \n*Incorporeal heritable property. \n\n== Corporeal Property ==\n[Section in Edit]\n\n===  Corporeal Heritable Property ===\n[Section in Edit]\n\n=== Corporeal Moveable Property ===\n[Section in Edit]\n\n== Incorporeal Property ==\n[Section in Edit]\n\n=== '''Incorporeal Moveable property''' ===\n[Section in Edit]\n\nIntellectual property{{main|Scots intellectual property law}}\n[[Intellectual property]] (IP) in Scotland is governed mostly by [[statute]] and is governed on a UK wide level. However it was a Scottish case ''[[Wills v Zetnews]]'' (1997 FSR 604) that first applied the existing [[copyright law]] to the [[internet]] by categorising the net as a [[cable programme]]. This definition has now been superseded by [[European directives]] but the principle still stands.\n\n== Other Legal Rules Relating to Property in Scotland ==\n\n=====Feudal law=====\nThe [[feudal]] system lingered on in Scots law on land ownership, so that a [[landowner]] as a ''[[vassal]]'' still had obligations to a ''[[feudal superior]]'' including payment of ''[[feu duty]]''. This enabled developers to impose [[Eternity|perpetual]] conditions dictating how buildings had to be constructed and maintained, but added complications and became abused to demand payments from ''vassals'' who wanted to make minor changes. In 1974 legislation began a process of redeeming ''feu duties'' so that most of these payments were ended. A major package of land reform (the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]], the [[Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003]] and the [[Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004]]) commenced on 28 November 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref>\n\nAgreement on an offer for property purchase is a legally binding contract, resulting in a system of [[conveyancing]] where buyers get their [[surveying|survey]] done before making a bid to the seller's solicitor, and after a closing date for [[Bidding|bid]]s the seller's acceptance is binding on both parties, preventing [[gazump]]ing. In recent times sales of house by way of offering to sell to the first party to make an unconditional offer of a fixed price has eroded the traditional ''offers over'' system.  It is important historically because the [[feu (land tenure)|feu]] was first created in Scotland, which is an antecedent of the [[fee]] system, used in conveyancing throughout the [[common law]] system.\n\n=====Udal law=====\nThe [[Northern Isles]] used a system called [[Udal Law]], owing to their former status as territory of [[Norway]].  However, following legal reforms in November 2004, the significance of udal law in those islands has greatly reduced.\n\n==See also==\n*[[English property law]]\n*[[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]]\n*[[Copyright law of the United Kingdom]] \n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Scots law}}\n\n[[Category:Scots property law| ]] \n\n{{Scotland-law-stub}}\n", "text_old": "'''Scots property law''' governs the rules relating to [[property]] found in the legal jurisdiction of [[Scotland]].

By the 17th and 18th century, a group of academics, now called the [[Scots law|institutional writers,]] wrote authoritative texts on large areas of Scots law, including property law, which came to be regarded as a formal [[Sources of law|source of law]] from the 19th century onwards. \n\nFollowing the [[Acts of Union 1707]], [[Scots law#Private law|Scots Law]] and its courts, such as the [[Court of Session]], continued to operate as a separate legal system under the terms of Article XIX (19) of the [[Treaty of Union]] and the jurisdiction retained its independence following the creation of subsequent United Kingdom states in [[Parliament of Great Britain|1800]] and [[United Kingdom|1922]],  although Scots law was subject to modification by Acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and latterly, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], and from judgments of the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] in appeals from the Court of Session.\n\nToday, Scots property law is part of Scots private law and as such is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] competence of the [[Scottish Parliament]] under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]<ref>[[Scotland Act 1998]] s.126.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/12506.aspx|title=What are the powers of the Scottish Parliament?|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The Scottish Parliament has introduced key pieces of legislation in relating to property law: notably the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000]] and the [[Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012]]. However, large areas of Scots property law still remain governed by pre-existing legal authority predating the creation of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999. so its '''current''' [[sources of law]] include: \n\n* The works of the [[Scots law#Academic writings|Institutional Writers]].\n*[[Common law]] decisions of the Scottish courts, including [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judgments of the House of Lords]] (and its successor, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]), in civil appeals from the Court of Session.\n*[[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland]].\n*[[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of the Parliaments of the United Kingdoms]].\n*[[Act of the Scottish Parliament|Acts of the Scottish Parliament.]]\n\n== Real Rights in Scots Property Law  ==\n\n=== Personal Rights and Real Rights ===\nA fundamental distinction in Scots law is that of '''personal rights''' and '''real rights,''' which follows the [[Roman law]] classification of rights falling into either of two categories:  a ''jus in personam'' or a ''jus in rem'', which the works of Barry Nicholas describes as: \n\n\"Any claim is either i''n rem'' or ''in personam'', and there is an unbridgeable division between them. '''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights ''in rem'' and rights ''in personam.'' Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref> \n\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of the defender committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care), with the result is the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') brings to a Scottish court an action against an individual. A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> Accordingly, within Scots Private law, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.<ref>See Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref>\n\n=== ''Numerus Clausus''===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights which follows the legal principle, shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B. Akkermans, ''The Principle of Numerus Clausus in European Property Law'' (Intersentia, 2008) vol 75, 75.</ref> that only real rights within the ''numerus clausus'' (closed number) are competent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swadling|first=William|date=2000|title='Opening the numerus clausus'|url=|journal=Law Quarterly Review|volume=116|pages=354|via=}}</ref> Without the valid creation of a recognised real right, an individual only holds a personal right against another. This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''numerus clausus'' is explained in a Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B. Edgeworth, 'The Numerus Clausus Principle in Contemporary Australian Property Law' (2006) 32 Monash U L Rev 387, 387.</ref> \n\nIn Scots property law, the real rights falling within the ''numerus clausus'' have never been formally codified, but it is considered that the primary real right is [[Ownership in Scots Law|ownership]] and subordinate to ownership are the lesser real rights<ref>''Erskine'' II,1,1, 'inferior real rights'.

There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property, ('''eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.''');''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property, which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult, such as where moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to land. In this situation, the rules of [[Accession (property law)|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland. \n\nAll property in Scots law belongs to one of each class, the result is four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own unique [[Transfer of property in Scots law|rules of transfer]], these are:\n\n* Corporeal heritable property\n* Corporeal moveable property\n* Incorporeal moveable property and Incorporeal heritable property. These are usually discussed together as 'incorporeal property', although the distinction between personal rights and real rights is important to remember.\n\n== Corporeal Property ==\n[Section in Edit]\n\n===  Corporeal Heritable Property ===\n[Section in Edit]\n\n=== Corporeal Moveable Property ===\n[Section in Edit]\n\n== Incorporeal Property ==\n[Section in Edit]\n\n=== '''Incorporeal Moveable property''' ===\n[Section in Edit]\n\nIntellectual property{{main|Scots intellectual property law}}\n[[Intellectual property]] (IP) in Scotland is governed mostly by [[statute]] and is governed on a UK wide level. However it was a Scottish case ''[[Wills v Zetnews]]'' (1997 FSR 604) that first applied the existing [[copyright law]] to the [[internet]] by categorising the net as a [[cable programme]]. This definition has now been superseded by [[European directives]] but the principle still stands.\n\n== Other Legal Rules Relating to Property in Scotland ==\n\n=====Feudal law=====\nThe [[feudal]] system lingered on in Scots law on land ownership, so that a [[landowner]] as a ''[[vassal]]'' still had obligations to a ''[[feudal superior]]'' including payment of ''[[feu duty]]''. This enabled developers to impose [[Eternity|perpetual]] conditions dictating how buildings had to be constructed and maintained, but added complications and became abused to demand payments from ''vassals'' who wanted to make minor changes. In 1974 legislation began a process of redeeming ''feu duties'' so that most of these payments were ended. A major package of land reform (the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]], the [[Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003]] and the [[Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004]]) commenced on 28 November 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref>\n\nAgreement on an offer for property purchase is a legally binding contract, resulting in a system of [[conveyancing]] where buyers get their [[surveying|survey]] done before making a bid to the seller's solicitor, and after a closing date for [[Bidding|bid]]s the seller's acceptance is binding on both parties, preventing [[gazump]]ing. In recent times sales of house by way of offering to sell to the first party to make an unconditional offer of a fixed price has eroded the traditional ''offers over'' system.  It is important historically because the [[feu (land tenure)|feu]] was first created in Scotland, which is an antecedent of the [[fee]] system, used in conveyancing throughout the [[common law]] system.\n\n=====Udal law=====\nThe [[Northern Isles]] used a system called [[Udal Law]], owing to their former status as territory of [[Norway]].  However, following legal reforms in November 2004, the significance of udal law in those islands has greatly reduced.\n\n==See also==\n*[[English property law]]\n*[[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]]\n*[[Copyright law of the United Kingdom]] \n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Scots law}}\n\n[[Category:Scots property law| ]] \n\n{{Scotland-law-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Kentigern1136", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDistinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_property_law"}

This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''.

These were Newtown (now Outfield) to the northeast and Bank (now Guardswell) to the southeast.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn 1691, around 250 people lived in the village, along with the hamlet of Craigdallie, which was at the bottom of the hill.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land, and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt Pitmiddle's demise. A once-thriving community of weavers, a blacksmith, two joiners, a tailor, a butcher and a public house<ref name=scotsman/> was now seeing young people leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nJust under one hundred people, living in 26 households, made up Pitmiddle's population in 1841.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nIn December 1896, ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' sent two reporters to Pitmiddle (which had seven families living there at the time) to investigate its living conditions after reports of \"clearance-style\" conditions on the hill. The reporters visited Maidie Mitchell and her sister, \"two very old ladies,\" who had spent their entire lives in Pitmiddle.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nBy 1897, there were only sixteen inhabitants,<ref>Longforgan news article</ref> exactly half of what it was six years earlier.<ref>[https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/1035486/long-read-soon-there-will-be-nothing-left-the-sad-story-of-taysides-ghost-village/ \"Tayside's lost village\"] - ''The Courier''</ref>\n\nA [[sawmill]] was active from before 1915.<ref>[https://www.forestry-memories.org.uk/picture/number1104/ \"Pitmiddle Sawmill March 1915\"] - Forestry Memories, 11 April 2012</ref>\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Inchmartine estate in 1917, Pitmiddle was eventually bought by the White family and farmed from Outfield. In 1930 there were only two houses that were occupied.

He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn 1691, around 250 people lived in the village, along with the hamlet of Craigdallie, which was at the bottom of the hill.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land, and separated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens. The village's water supply was sourced from three wells.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe rebuilding of the village failed to halt Pitmiddle's demise. A once-thriving community of weavers, a blacksmith, two joiners, a tailor, a butcher and a public house<ref name=scotsman/> was now seeing young people leaving to work in the factories in nearby [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nJust under one hundred people, living in 26 households, made up Pitmiddle's population in 1841.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nIn December 1896, ''[[The Dundee Courier]]'' sent two reporters to Pitmiddle (which had seven families living there at the time) to investigate its living conditions after reports of \"clearance-style\" conditions on the hill. The reporters visited Maidie Mitchell and her sister, \"two very old ladies,\" who had spent their entire lives in Pitmiddle.<ref name=scotsman/>\n\nBy 1897, there were only sixteen inhabitants,<ref>Longforgan news article</ref> exactly half of what it was six years earlier.<ref>[https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/perth-kinross/1035486/long-read-soon-there-will-be-nothing-left-the-sad-story-of-taysides-ghost-village/ \"Tayside's lost village\"] - ''The Courier''</ref>\n\nA [[sawmill]] was active from before 1915.<ref>[https://www.forestry-memories.org.uk/picture/number1104/ \"Pitmiddle Sawmill March 1915\"] - Forestry Memories, 11 April 2012</ref>\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Inchmartine estate in 1917, Pitmiddle was eventually bought by the White family and farmed from Outfield. In 1930 there were only two houses that were occupied. The final resident, James Gillies Jr., one of ten children  of [[stonemason]] James Sr. (1832\u20131920) and Margaret (1833\u20131908),<ref name=westmuir>[http://www.westmuir.org.uk/PDF%20Pages/Soldiering%20On.pdf \"\u2018Soldiering On\u2019 \u2026\u2026\u2026 and Magdalene\"] - Westmuir.org.uk</ref> left his home there for final time on 4 January, 1938.

It is on an [[alluvial plain]] set within rugged terrain on the upper reaches of the [[Whanganui River]], 65&nbsp;km south of [[Te Kuiti]] and 55&nbsp;km west of [[Turangi]]. It is under the [[jurisdiction]] of [[Ruapehu District]] and [[Manawat\u016b-Whanganui]] region.\n\nIts population is 4,503 (2013 census, this is down 11% from the 2006 census), making it the largest centre for a considerable distance in any direction. It is on [[New Zealand State Highway 4|State Highway 4]] and the [[North Island Main Trunk]] railway.\n\nThe name ''Taumarunui'' is reported to be the dying words of the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] chief Pehi Turoa \u2013 ''taumaru'' meaning screen and ''nui'' big, literally translated as Big Screen,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/maori-language-week/1000-maori-place-names|title=1000 M\u0101ori place names|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=6 August 2019}}</ref> being built to shelter him from the sun, or more commonly known to mean \u2013 \"The place of big shelter\".  There are also references to Taumarunui being known as large sheltered location for growing [[Sweet potato|kumara]].\n\nIn the 1980s publication ''Roll Back the Years'' there are some details on how Taumarunui got its name.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rollbacktheyears.co.nz/samples/vol1.pdf |format=PDF |page=9 |title=How Taumarunui got its name |accessdate=15 March 2009 |publisher=Roll Back the Years}}</ref> Extract: \"According to Frank T Brown, who wrote in the ''Taumarunui Press'' in 1926, the name Taumarunui is closely connected with the arrival of and conquering of that portion of the King Country by the Whanganui River natives during the 18th century . . . The war party that succeeded in capturing the principal pa and taking prisoner the chief of the district was headed by \"Ki Maru\". His warriors, to show their appreciation of his prowess and the honour of the victory, acclaimed him \"Tau-maru-nui\", which means \"Maru the Great\", or \"Maru the Conqueror\", that name was taken for the district and has been used ever since.\"\n\n==History and culture==\n[[File:Taitua-taumaranui1885.jpg|thumb|300px|Taitua at Taumarunui in 1885.]]Taumarunui was originally a Maori settlement at the confluence of the Ongarue River with the Whanganui, important canoe routes linking the interior of the island with the lower Whanganui River settlements. Some places, notably the valley of the Pungapunga Stream, which joins the upper Whanganui near Manunui, were celebrated for the size and quality of totara, and large canoes were built there. The area is a border area between a number of iwi including [[Whanganui (iwi)|Whanganui]], [[Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto]] and [[Ngati Tuwharetoa|Ng\u0101ti T\u016bwharetoa]], who lived together in relative harmony.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/T/Taumarunui/Taumarunui/en |title=TAUMARUNUI \u2013 Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n\nLate in December 1843 [[George Selwyn (bishop of Lichfield)|Bishop Selwyn]] travelled from the district south of Taupo to a point on the Whanganui River about six miles downstream from Taumarunui and thence continued his journey to the coast by canoe. Towards the end of 1869 Te Kooti was at Taumarunui before his march through the western Taupo district to Tapapa. In the early 1880s the first surveys of the King Country commenced and by the early 1890s the Crown had begun the purchase of large areas of land.\n\nIn 1874 Alexander Bell set up a trading post, and became the first European settler. The town has a road called Bell Road.\n\nDuring the [[New Zealand Wars]] a resident named William Moffatt manufactured and supplied Maori with a coarse kind of gunpowder. He was afterwards expelled from the district. Despite warnings he returned in 1880, ostensibly to prospect for gold, and was executed.\n\nThe Whanganui River long continued to be the principal route serving Taumarunui. Traffic was at first by Maori canoe, but by the late 1880s regular steamship communication was established. Taumarunui Landing ([http://www.riverboats.homestead.com/files/Riverboat_Mix_06.jpg Image]) was the last stop on [[Alexander Hatrick]]'s steam boat service from Wanganui. The river vessels maintained the services between Wanganui and Taumarunui until the late 1920s, when the condition of the river deteriorated.\n\nLater Taumarunui gained importance with the completion of the [[North Island Main Trunk|North Island Main Trunk line]] in 1908\u201309 (celebrated in a ballad by [[Peter Cape]] about the [[Taumarunui Railway Station|station]] refreshment room). The line south of Taumarunui caused considerable problems due to the terrain, and has several high viaducts and the famous [[Raurimu Spiral]].

It is on an [[alluvial plain]] set within rugged terrain on the upper reaches of the [[Whanganui River]], 65&nbsp;km south of [[Te Kuiti]] and 55&nbsp;km west of [[Turangi]]. It is under the [[jurisdiction]] of [[Ruapehu District]] and [[Manawat\u016b-Whanganui]] region.\n\nIts population is 4,503 (2013 census, this is down 11% from the 2006 census), making it the largest centre for a considerable distance in any direction. It is on [[New Zealand State Highway 4|State Highway 4]] and the [[North Island Main Trunk]] railway.\n\nThe name ''Taumarunui'' is reported to be the dying words of the [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] chief Pehi Turoa \u2013 ''taumaru'' meaning screen and ''nui'' big, literally translated as Big Screen,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/maori-language-week/1000-maori-place-names|title=1000 M\u0101ori place names|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage|date=6 August 2019}}</ref> being built to shelter him from the sun, or more commonly known to mean \u2013 \"The place of big shelter\".  There are also references to Taumarunui being known as large sheltered location for growing [[Sweet potato|kumara]].\n\nIn the 1980s publication ''Roll Back the Years'' there are some details on how Taumarunui got its name.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rollbacktheyears.co.nz/samples/vol1.pdf |format=PDF |page=9 |title=How Taumarunui got its name |accessdate=15 March 2009 |publisher=Roll Back the Years}}</ref> Extract: \"According to Frank T Brown, who wrote in the ''Taumarunui Press'' in 1926, the name Taumarunui is closely connected with the arrival of and conquering of that portion of the King Country by the Whanganui River natives during the 18th century . . . The war party that succeeded in capturing the principal pa and taking prisoner the chief of the district was headed by \"Ki Maru\". His warriors, to show their appreciation of his prowess and the honour of the victory, acclaimed him \"Tau-maru-nui\", which means \"Maru the Great\", or \"Maru the Conqueror\", that name was taken for the district and has been used ever since.\"\n\n==History and culture==\n[[File:Taitua-taumaranui1885.jpg|thumb|300px|Taitua at Taumarunui in 1885.]]Taumarunui was originally a Maori settlement at the confluence of the Ongarue River with the Whanganui, important canoe routes linking the interior of the island with the lower Whanganui River settlements. Some places, notably the valley of the Pungapunga Stream, which joins the upper Whanganui near Manunui, were celebrated for the size and quality of totara, and large canoes were built there. The area is a border area between a number of iwi including [[Whanganui (iwi)|Whanganui]], [[Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto]] and [[Ngati Tuwharetoa|Ng\u0101ti T\u016bwharetoa]], who lived together in relative harmony.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/T/Taumarunui/Taumarunui/en |title=TAUMARUNUI \u2013 Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=Teara.govt.nz |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n\nLate in December 1843 [[George Selwyn (bishop of Lichfield)|Bishop Selwyn]] travelled from the district south of Taupo to a point on the Whanganui River about six miles downstream from Taumarunui and thence continued his journey to the coast by canoe. Towards the end of 1869 Te Kooti was at Taumarunui before his march through the western Taupo district to Tapapa. In the early 1880s the first surveys of the King Country commenced and by the early 1890s the Crown had begun the purchase of large areas of land.\n\nIn 1874 Alexander Bell set up a trading post, and became the first European settler. The town has a road called Bell Road.\n\nDuring the [[New Zealand Wars]] a resident named William Moffatt manufactured and supplied Maori with a coarse kind of gunpowder. He was afterwards expelled from the district. Despite warnings he returned in 1880, ostensibly to prospect for gold, and was executed.\n\nThe Whanganui River long continued to be the principal route serving Taumarunui. Traffic was at first by Maori canoe, but by the late 1880s regular steamship communication was established. Taumarunui Landing ([http://www.riverboats.homestead.com/files/Riverboat_Mix_06.jpg Image]) was the last stop on [[Alexander Hatrick]]'s steam boat service from Wanganui. The river vessels maintained the services between Wanganui and Taumarunui until the late 1920s, when the condition of the river deteriorated.\n\nLater Taumarunui gained importance with the completion of the [[North Island Main Trunk|North Island Main Trunk line]] in 1908\u201309 (celebrated in a ballad by [[Peter Cape]] about the [[Taumarunui Railway Station|station]] refreshment room). The line south of Taumarunui caused considerable problems due to the terrain, and has several high viaducts and the famous [[Raurimu Spiral]]. The [[Stratford\u2013Okahukura Line]] to [[Stratford, New Zealand|Stratford]] connected just north of Taumarunui. In more recent times, the town's economy has been based on [[forestry]] and farming. It has gained in importance as a tourism centre, especially as an entry point for voyagers down the scenic Wanganui River and as the possessor of a high quality golf course.\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n====1800s====\n*  1862, 8/9 February \u2013 [[Coutts Crawford|James Coutts Crawford]] visits, was given a number of old songs and \"various accounts of the taniwha, one of whom we were told overthrew the [[Whangaehu River|Wangaehu]] bridge.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/recollectionstr00coutgoog |title=Recollections of travel in New Zealand and Australia : Crawford, James Coutts : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date=2001-03-10 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n* 1864 \u2013 Boundaries of the [[King Country]] drawn and European settlement is prohibited.<!-- \"Switching on the King Country\" - Hellen Reilly -->\n* 1869 \u2013 [[Te Kooti]] in Taumarunui.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=TC18700118.2.32 |title=Papers Past \u2014 Colonist \u2014 18 January 1870 \u2014 IMPORTANT FROM WAIKATO |publisher=Paperspast.natlib.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23}}</ref>\n* 1871 \u2013 [[Thomas McDonnell]] in area following up on reports of gold.
