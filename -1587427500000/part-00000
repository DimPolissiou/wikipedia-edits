The Maya occupied a territory that is now incorporated into the modern countries of [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]]; the conquest began in the early 16th century and is generally considered to have ended in 1697.\n\nThe conquest of the Maya was hindered by their politically fragmented state. Spanish and native tactics and technology differed greatly. The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns; they viewed the taking of prisoners as a hindrance to outright victory, whereas the Maya prioritised the capture of live prisoners and of booty. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic; in response to the use of Spanish cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits and lining them with wooden stakes. Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the European conquerors. Spanish weaponry included [[broadsword]]s, [[rapier]]s, [[lance]]s, [[pike (weapon)|pike]]s, [[halberd]]s, [[crossbow]]s, [[matchlock]]s and light [[history of artillery|artillery]]. [[Maya warfare|Maya warriors]] fought with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows, stones, and wooden swords with inset [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] blades, and wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Maya lacked key elements of [[Old World]] technology such as a functional [[Wheel#History|wheel]], horses, iron, steel, and [[gunpowder]]; they were also extremely susceptible to Old World diseases, against which they had no resistance.\n\nBefore the conquest, Maya territory contained a number of competing kingdoms. Many conquistadors viewed the Maya as \"[[infidel]]s\" who needed to be forcefully converted and pacified, disregarding the achievements of their [[Maya civilization|civilization]].{{sfn|Jones|2000|p=356}} The first contact between the Maya and [[European colonization of the Americas|European explorers]] came in the early 16th century when a [[Spain|Spanish]] ship sailing from [[Panama]] to [[Hispaniola|Santo Domingo]] was wrecked on the east coast of the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] in 1511. Several Spanish expeditions followed in 1517 and 1519, making landfall on various parts of the Yucat\u00e1n coast. The Spanish conquest of the Maya was a prolonged affair; the Maya kingdoms resisted integration into the [[Spanish Empire]] with such tenacity that their defeat took almost two centuries.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=8, 757}} The [[Itza people|Itza Maya]] and other lowland groups in the [[Pet\u00e9n Basin]] were first contacted by [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] in 1525, but remained independent and hostile to the encroaching Spanish until 1697, when a concerted Spanish assault led by [[Mart\u00edn de Urs\u00faa|Mart\u00edn de Urz\u00faa y Arizmendi]] finally defeated the last independent Maya kingdom.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Gulf of Honduras.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Satellite view of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]\nThe [[Maya civilization]] occupied a wide territory that included southeastern [[Mexico]] and northern [[Central America]]; this area included the entire [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]], and all of the territory now incorporated into the modern countries of [[Guatemala]] and [[Belize]], as well as the western portions of [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]].{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=26}} In Mexico, the Maya occupied territory now incorporated into the states of [[Chiapas]], [[Tabasco]], [[Campeche]], [[Quintana Roo]] and [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]].{{sfnm|1a1=Phillips|1y=2007|1p=47|2a1=ITMB|2y=2000}}\n\nThe Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the east and by the Gulf of Mexico to the north and west.

After this, Mazariegos and his companions proceeded to Chiapan and set up a temporary camp nearby, that they named Villa Real. Mazariegos had arrived with a mandate to establish a new colonial province of Chiapa in the Chiapas Highlands. He initially met with resistance from the veteran ''conquistadores'' who had already established themselves in the region.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=80}} Mazariegos heard that Pedro de Portocarrero was in the highlands, and sought him out in order to persuade him to leave. The two conquistadors eventually met up in Huixtan.{{sfn|G\u00f3mez Couti\u00f1o|2014|p=58}} Mazariegos entered into protracted three-month negotiations with the Spanish settlers in Coatzacoalcos (Esp\u00edritu Santo) and San Crist\u00f3bal de los Llanos. Eventually an agreement was reached, and the ''encomiendas'' of Esp\u00edritu Santo that lay in the highlands were merged those of San Crist\u00f3bal to form the new province. Unknown to Mazariegos, the king had already issued an order that the settlements of San Crist\u00f3bal de los Llanos be transferred to Pedro de Alvarado. The end result of the negotiations between Mazariegos and the established settlers was that Villa de San Crist\u00f3bal de los Llanos was broken up, and those settlers who wished to remain were transferred to Villa Real, which had been moved to the fertile Jovel valley.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=80}} Pedro de Portocarrero left Chiapas and returned to Guatemala.{{sfn|G\u00f3mez Couti\u00f1o|2014|p=58}} Mazariegos proceeded with the policy of moving the Indians into ''reducciones''; this process was made easier by the much reduced indigenous population levels.{{sfn|Obreg\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez|2003|p=10}} Mazariegos issued licences of ''encomienda'' covering still unconquered regions in order to encourage colonists to conquer new territory.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=82}} The Province of Chiapa had no coastal territory, and at the end of this process about 100 Spanish settlers were concentrated in the remote provincial capital at Villa Real, surrounded by hostile Indian settlements, and with deep internal divisions. {{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=81}}\n\n===Rebellion in the Chiapas Highlands, 1528===\nAlthough Mazariegos had managed to establish his new provincial capital without armed conflict, excessive Spanish demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion. In August 1528, Mazariegos replaced the existing ''encomenderos'' with his friends and allies; the natives, seeing the Spanish isolated and witnessing the hostility between the original and newly arrived settlers, took this opportunity to rebel and refused to supply their new masters. Zinacant\u00e1n was the only indigenous settlement that remained loyal to the Spanish.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=81}}\n\nVilla Real was now surrounded by hostile territory, and any Spanish help was too far away to be of value. The colonists quickly ran short of food and responded by taking up arms and riding against the Indians in search of food and slaves. The Indians abandoned their towns and hid their women and children in caves. The rebellious populations concentrated themselves on easily defended mountaintops. At [[Quetzaltepeque, Chiapas|Quetzaltepeque]] a lengthy battle was fought between the [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal Maya]] and the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of a number of Spanish. The battle lasted several days, and the Spanish were supported by indigenous warriors from central Mexico. The battle eventually resulted in a Spanish victory, but the rest of the province of Chiapa remained rebellious.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=81}}\n\nAfter the battle of Quetzaltepeque, Villa Real was still short on food and Mazariegos was ill; he retreated to Copanaguastla against the protests of the town council, which was left to defend the fledgling colony.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=81}} By now, [[Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n]] was governor in Mexico, and he despatched Juan Enr\u00edquez de Guzm\u00e1n to Chiapa as [[Trial of residence|end-of-term judge]] over Mazariegos, and as [[Corregidor (position)|''alcalde mayor'']] (a local colonial governor).

He immediately reinstated the old name of San Crist\u00f3bal de los Llanos upon Villa Real. Once again, the ''encomiendas'' of Chiapa were transferred to new owners. The Spanish launched an expedition against Puyumatlan; it was not successful in terms of conquest, but enabled the Spanish to seize more slaves to trade for weapons and horses. The newly acquired supplies would then be used in further expeditions to conquer and pacify still-independent regions, leading to a cycle of slave raids, trade for supplies, followed by further conquests and slave raids.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=82}} The Mazariegos family managed to establish a power base in the local colonial institutions and, in 1535, they succeeded in having San Crist\u00f3bal de los Llanos declared a city, with the new name of Ciudad Real. They also managed to acquire special privileges from the Crown in order to stabilise the colony, such as an edict that specified that the governor of Chiapa must govern in person and not through a delegated representative.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=82}} In practise, the quick turnover of ''encomiendas'' continued, since few Spaniards had legal Spanish wives and legitimate children who could inherit. This situation would not stabilise until the 1540s, when the dire shortage of Spanish women in the colony was alleviated by an influx of new colonists.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=83}}\n\n===Establishment of the Dominicans in Chiapa, 1545\u20131547===\n[[File:Painting of Santiago Matamoros.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Santiago Matamoros was a readily identifiable image of Spanish military superiority]]\nIn 1542, the [[New Laws]] were issued with the aim of protecting the indigenous peoples of the Spanish colonies from their overexploitation by the ''encomenderos''.

After this battle, the younger Francisco de Montejo was despatched to the northern Cupul province, where the lord Naabon Cupul reluctantly allowed him to found the Spanish town of Ciudad Real at Chichen Itza. Montejo parcelled out the province amongst his soldiers as ''[[encomienda]]s''. After six months of Spanish rule, Naabon Cupul was killed during a failed attempt to kill Montejo the Younger. The death of their lord only served to inflame Cupul anger and, in mid 1533, they laid siege to the small Spanish garrison at Chichen Itza. Montejo the Younger abandoned Ciudad Real by night, and he and his men fled west, where the [[Cheles (chiefdom)|Chel]], [[Ceh Pech|Pech]] and Xiu provinces remained obedient to Spanish rule.

Around this time the news began to arrive of [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s conquests in Peru and the rich plunder there. Montejo's soldiers began to abandon him to seek their fortune elsewhere; in seven years of attempted conquest in the northern provinces of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, very little gold had been found. Towards the end of 1534 or the beginning of the next year, Montejo the Elder and his son retreated to Veracruz, taking their remaining soldiers with them.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=770}}\n\nMontejo the Elder became embroiled in colonial infighting over the right to rule Honduras, a claim that put him in conflict with Pedro de Alvarado, captain general of Guatemala, who also claimed Honduras as part of his jurisdiction.

On the steep southern slopes they clashed with between four and five thousand Ixil warriors; a lengthy battle followed during which the Spanish cavalry outflanked the Ixil army and forced them to retreat to their mountaintop fortress at Nebaj.

A second church was built at B\u02bcatkab\u02bc to attend to over 100 K\u02bcejache refugees who had been gathered there under the stewardship of a Spanish friar;{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=160}} a further church was established at Tzuktok\u02bc, overseen by another friar.{{sfn|Jones|1998|pp=160\u2013161}}\n\nFranciscan Andr\u00e9s de Avenda\u00f1o left M\u00e9rida on 13 December 1695, and arrived in Nojpet\u00e9n around 14 January 1696, accompanied by four companions.{{sfn|Jones|1998|pp=187, 189}} The Franciscans baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days. Avenda\u00f1o tried to convince Kan Ek\u02bc to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish Crown, without success. The king of the Itza, cited Itza prophecy and said the time was not yet right.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=775}} Kan Ek\u02bc learnt of a plot by the Kowoj and their allies to ambush and kill the Franciscans, and the Itza king advised them to return to M\u00e9rida via Tipuj.{{sfnm|1a1=Sharer|1a2=Traxler|1y=2006|1p=775|2a1=Jones|2y=1998|2pp=214\u2013215}}\n\n====February\u2013March 1696====\nWhen Captain Garc\u00eda de Paredes arrived at Chuntuki in mid-January,{{sfn|Jones|1998|pp=189, 226}} he only had 90 soldiers plus labourers.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=226}} Captain Pedro de Zubiaur, Garc\u00eda's senior officer, arrived at Lake Pet\u00e9n Itza with 60 musketeers, two Franciscans, and allied Yucatec Maya warriors.{{sfnm|1a1=Jones|1y=1998|1p=227|2a1=Sharer|2a2=Traxler|2y=2006|2p=776}} They were also accompanied by about 40 Maya porters.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=227}} They were approached by about 300 canoes carrying approximately 2,000 Itza warriors.{{sfnm|1a1=Jones|1y=1998|1p=228|2a1=Sharer|2a2=Traxler|2y=2006|2p=776}} The warriors mingled freely with the Spanish party and the encounter degenerated into a skirmish. About a dozen of the Spanish party were seized, and three were killed. The Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets, and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners, who included the two Franciscans.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=228}} The Spanish party retreated from the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were surrounded by thousands of Itza warriors. Zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 Itzas. Realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered, the Spanish retreated towards Chuntuki, abandoning their captured companions.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=229}} Mart\u00edn de Urs\u00faa now began to organise an all-out assault on Nojpet\u00e9n.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=776}} Work on the road was redoubled and about a month after the battle at Ch\u02bcich\u02bc the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=229}}\n\nA Guatemalan expedition against the Itza set out from Cahab\u00f3n in early 1696. An advance party was led into an Itza trap and 87 expedition members were lost, including 50 soldiers, two Dominicans and about 35 Maya helpers.{{sfn|Jones|1998|pp=232\u2013234, 479n59}} The rest of the party arrived at the shore of Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, but quickly retreated back to Guatemala.{{sfn|Jones|1998|pp=234\u2013235, 237\u2013239, 241\u2013242}}\n\n====Assault on Nojpet\u00e9n====\nMart\u00edn de Urz\u00faa y Arizmendi arrived on the western shore of Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 with his soldiers on 26 February 1697. Once there they built a heavily armed ''galeota'' attack boat,{{sfnm|1a1=Jones|1y=2009|1p=59|2a1=Jones|2y=1998|2pp=253, 265\u2013266}} which carried 114 men and at least five artillery pieces.{{sfn|Jones|1998|pp=268\u2013269}} On 10 March, Urs\u00faa received a mixed Itza and Yalain embassy in peace, and invited Kan Ek\u02bc to visit his encampment three days later.{{sfnm|1a1=Jones|1y=1998|1pp=269\u2013270|2a1=Sharer|2a2=Traxler|2y=2006|2p=777}} On the appointed day, Kan Ek\u02bc failed to arrive; instead Maya warriors amassed both along the shore and in canoes upon the lake.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=777}} That morning, a waterbourne assault was launched upon Kan Ek's capital.{{sfnm|1a1=Sharer|1a2=Traxler|1y=2006|1p=777|2a1=Jones|2y=1998|2p=295}} The city fell after a brief but bloody battle in which many Itza warriors died; the Spanish suffered only minor casualties.{{sfn|Jones|2009|p=59}} After the battle the surviving defenders swam across to the mainland and melted away into the forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy the abandoned town.{{sfnm|1a1=Jones|1y=2000|1p=362|2a1=Sharer|2a2=Traxler|2y=2006|2pp=777\u2013778}} Mart\u00edn de Urs\u00faa renamed Nojpet\u00e9n as ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza'' (\"Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza\").{{sfnm|1a1=Sharer|1a2=Traxler|1y=2006|1p=778|2a1=Jones|2y=2009|2p=59}} Kan Ek\u02bc was soon captured with help from the Yalain Maya ruler Chamach Xulu;{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=306}} The Kowoj king was also soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families.{{sfn|Jones|2009|p=59}} With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to the European colonisers.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=xix}}\n\n==Final years of conquest==\nDuring the campaign to conquer the Itza of Pet\u00e9n, the Spanish sent expeditions to harass and relocate the Mopan north of Lake Izabal and the Ch\u02bcol Maya of the Amatique forests to the east. They were resettled on the south shore of the lake. By the latter half of the 18th century, the local inhabitants consisted entirely of Spaniards, [[mulattos]] and others of mixed race, all associated with the [[Castillo de San Felipe de Lara]] fort guarding the entrance to Lake Izabal.{{sfn|Feldman|1998|p=11}} There was a drastic depopulation of Lake Izabal and the Motagua Delta due to constant slave raids by the [[Miskito Sambu]] of the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean coast]] that effectively ended the Maya population of the region; the captured Maya were sold into slavery in the [[Crown colony|British colony]] of [[Jamaica]].{{sfn|Feldman|1998|p=12}}\n\nIn the late 17th century the small population of Ch\u02bcol Maya in southern Pet\u00e9n and [[Belize]] was forcibly removed to Alta Verapaz, where the people were absorbed into the Q\u02bceqchi\u02bc population. The Ch\u02bcol of the Lacandon Jungle were resettled in [[Huehuetenango Department|Huehuetenango]] in the early 18th century.{{sfn|Jones|2000|p=365}} By 1699 the neighbouring Toquegua no longer existed as a separate people because of a combination of high mortality and intermarriage with the Amatique Indians.{{sfn|Feldman|1998|p=10}} At around this time the Spanish decided on the reduction of the independent Mopan Maya living to the north of Lake Izabal.{{sfn|Feldman|1998|pp=10\u201311}} Catholic priests from Yucat\u00e1n founded several mission towns around Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 in 1702\u20131703. Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled in 1704, but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed and most of the mission towns were abandoned. By 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Pet\u00e9n, compared to ten times that number in 1697.{{sfn|Jones|2009|p=59}} Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part.{{sfn|Jones|2009|p=60}}\n\n==Legacy of the Spanish conquest==\nThe initial shock of the Spanish conquest was followed by decades of heavy exploitation of the indigenous peoples, allies and foes alike.{{sfn|Restall|Asselbergs|2007|p=111}} Over the following two hundred years colonial rule gradually imposed Spanish cultural standards on the subjugated peoples. The Spanish ''reducciones'' created new nucleated settlements laid out in a grid pattern in the Spanish style, with a central plaza, a church and the town hall housing the civil government, known as the ''[[ayuntamiento]]''. This style of settlement can still be seen in the villages and towns of the area.{{sfn|Coe|1999|p=231}} The introduction of [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] was the main vehicle for cultural change, and resulted in religious [[syncretism]].{{sfn|Coe|1999|pp=231\u2013232}} Old World cultural elements came to be thoroughly adopted by Maya groups.{{sfn|Coe|1999|p=233}} The greatest change was replacement of the pre-Columbian economic order by European technology and livestock; this included the introduction of iron and steel tools to replace [[Neolithic]] tools, and of cattle, pigs and chickens. New crops were also introduced; however, sugarcane and [[Coffee production in Guatemala|coffee]] led to plantations that economically exploited native labour.{{sfn|Coe|1999|p=232}} Some indigenous elites such as the Xajil Kaqchikel noble family did manage to maintain a level of status into the colonial period.{{sfn|Restall|Asselbergs|2007|p=104}} During the second half of the 18th century, adult male Indians were heavily taxed, often being forced into [[Debt bondage|debt peonage]]. Western Pet\u00e9n and neighbouring Chiapas remained sparsely populated, and the Maya inhabitants avoided contact with the Spanish.{{sfn|Schwartz|1990|p=39}}\n\n==Historical sources==\n[[File:LienzodeTlaxcalaLamina5.jpg|thumb|left|A page from the ''[[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]]'', showing a Spanish conquistador accompanied by Tlaxcalan allies and a native porter|alt=Painting with three prominent indigenous warriors in single file facing left, wearing cloaks and grasping staves, followed by a dog.

Other accounts were in the form of questionnaires answered before colonial magistrates to protest and register a claim for recompense.{{sfn|Restall|Asselbergs|2007|pp=79\u201381}} Two pictorial accounts painted in the stylised indigenous pictographic tradition have survived; these are the ''[[Lienzo de Quauhquechollan]]'', and the ''[[History of Tlaxcala|Lienzo de Tlaxcala]]''.{{sfn|Restall|Asselbergs|2007|p=94}} Accounts of the conquest as seen from the point of view of the defeated highland Maya kingdoms are included in a number of indigenous documents, including the ''[[Annals of the Cakchiquels|Annals of the Kaqchikels]]''.{{sfn|Restall|Asselbergs|2007|pp=103\u2013104}} A letter from the defeated [[Tz\u02bcutujil people|Tz\u02bcutujil Maya]] nobility to the Spanish king written in 1571 details the exploitation of the subjugated peoples.{{sfn|Restall|Asselbergs|2007|p=111}}\n[[Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzm\u00e1n]] was a colonial Guatemalan historian of Spanish descent who wrote ''La Recordaci\u00f3n Florida''.

The Maya occupied a territory that is now incorporated into the modern countries of [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]]; the conquest began in the early 16th century and is generally considered to have ended in 1697.\n\nThe conquest of the Maya was hindered by their politically fragmented state. Spanish and native tactics and technology differed greatly. The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns; they viewed the taking of prisoners as a hindrance to outright victory, whereas the Maya prioritised the capture of live prisoners and of booty. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic; in response to the use of Spanish cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits and lining them with wooden stakes. Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the European conquerors. Spanish weaponry included [[broadsword]]s, [[rapier]]s, [[lance]]s, [[pike (weapon)|pike]]s, [[halberd]]s, [[crossbow]]s, [[matchlock]]s and light [[history of artillery|artillery]]. [[Maya warfare|Maya warriors]] fought with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows, stones, and wooden swords with inset [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] blades, and wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Maya lacked key elements of [[Old World]] technology such as a functional [[Wheel#History|wheel]], horses, iron, steel, and [[gunpowder]]; they were also extremely susceptible to Old World diseases, against which they had no resistance.\n\nBefore the conquest, Maya territory contained a number of competing kingdoms.

Eventually an agreement was reached, and the ''encomiendas'' of Esp\u00edritu Santo that lay in the highlands were merged those of San Crist\u00f3bal to form the new province. Unknown to Mazariegos, the king had already issued an order that the settlements of San Crist\u00f3bal de los Llanos be transferred to Pedro de Alvarado. The end result of the negotiations between Mazariegos and the established settlers was that Villa de San Crist\u00f3bal de los Llanos was broken up, and those settlers who wished to remain were transferred to Villa Real, which had been moved to the fertile Jovel valley.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=80}} Pedro de Portocarrero left Chiapas and returned to Guatemala.{{sfn|G\u00f3mez Couti\u00f1o|2014|p=58}} Mazariegos proceeded with the policy of moving the Indians into ''reducciones''; this process was made easier by the much reduced indigenous population levels.{{sfn|Obreg\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez|2003|p=10}} Mazariegos issued licences of ''encomienda'' covering still unconquered regions in order to encourage colonists to conquer new territory.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=82}} The Province of Chiapa had no coastal territory, and at the end of this process about 100 Spanish settlers were concentrated in the remote provincial capital at Villa Real, surrounded by hostile Indian settlements, and with deep internal divisions. {{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=81}}\n\n===Rebellion in the Chiapas Highlands, 1528===\nAlthough Mazariegos had managed to establish his new provincial capital without armed conflict, excessive Spanish demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion. In August 1528, Mazariegos replaced the existing ''encomenderos'' with his friends and allies; the natives, seeing the Spanish isolated and witnessing the hostility between the original and newly arrived settlers, took this opportunity to rebel and refused to supply their new masters. Zinacant\u00e1n was the only indigenous settlement that remained loyal to the Spanish.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=81}}\n\nVilla Real was now surrounded by hostile territory, and any Spanish help was too far away to be of value. The colonists quickly ran short of food and responded by taking up arms and riding against the Indians in search of food and slaves. The Indians abandoned their towns and hid their women and children in caves. The rebellious populations concentrated themselves on easily defended mountaintops. At [[Quetzaltepeque, Chiapas|Quetzaltepeque]] a lengthy battle was fought between the [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal Maya]] and the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of a number of Spanish. The battle lasted several days, and the Spanish were supported by indigenous warriors from central Mexico. The battle eventually resulted in a Spanish victory, but the rest of the province of Chiapa remained rebellious.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=81}}\n\nAfter the battle of Quetzaltepeque, Villa Real was still short on food and Mazariegos was ill; he retreated to Copanaguastla against the protests of the town council, which was left to defend the fledgling colony.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=81}} By now, [[Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n]] was governor in Mexico, and he despatched Juan Enr\u00edquez de Guzm\u00e1n to Chiapa as [[Trial of residence|end-of-term judge]] over Mazariegos, and as [[Corregidor (position)|''alcalde mayor'']] (a local colonial governor). He occupied his post for a year, during which time he attempted to reestablish Spanish control over the province, especially the northern and eastern regions, but was unable to make much headway.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=82}}\n\n===Founding of Ciudad Real, Chiapa, 1531\u20131535===\nIn 1531, Pedro de Alvarado finally took up the post of governor of Chiapa. He immediately reinstated the old name of San Crist\u00f3bal de los Llanos upon Villa Real. Once again, the ''encomiendas'' of Chiapa were transferred to new owners. The Spanish launched an expedition against Puyumatlan; it was not successful in terms of conquest, but enabled the Spanish to seize more slaves to trade for weapons and horses. The newly acquired supplies would then be used in further expeditions to conquer and pacify still-independent regions, leading to a cycle of slave raids, trade for supplies, followed by further conquests and slave raids.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=82}} The Mazariegos family managed to establish a power base in the local colonial institutions and, in 1535, they succeeded in having San Crist\u00f3bal de los Llanos declared a city, with the new name of Ciudad Real. They also managed to acquire special privileges from the Crown in order to stabilise the colony, such as an edict that specified that the governor of Chiapa must govern in person and not through a delegated representative.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=82}} In practise, the quick turnover of ''encomiendas'' continued, since few Spaniards had legal Spanish wives and legitimate children who could inherit. This situation would not stabilise until the 1540s, when the dire shortage of Spanish women in the colony was alleviated by an influx of new colonists.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=83}}\n\n===Establishment of the Dominicans in Chiapa, 1545\u20131547===\n[[File:Painting of Santiago Matamoros.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Santiago Matamoros was a readily identifiable image of Spanish military superiority]]\nIn 1542, the [[New Laws]] were issued with the aim of protecting the indigenous peoples of the Spanish colonies from their overexploitation by the ''encomenderos''. Friar [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] and his followers left Spain in July 1544 to enforce the New Laws. Las Casas arrived in Ciudad Real with 16 fellow Dominicans on 12 March 1545.{{sfn|G\u00f3mez Couti\u00f1o|2014|p=18}} The Dominicans were the first religious order to attempt the evangelisation of the native population. Their arrival meant that the colonists were no longer free to treat the natives as they saw fit without the risk of intervention by the religious authorities.{{sfn|Lenkersdorf|2004|p=85}} The Dominicans soon came into conflict with the established colonists. Colonial opposition to the Dominicans was such that the Dominicans were forced to flee Ciudad Real in fear of their lives. They established themselves nearby in two indigenous villages, the old site of Villa Real de Chiapa and Cinacantl\u00e1n. From Villa Real, Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas and his companions prepared for the evangelisation of all the territory that fell within the [[Bishopric of Chiapa]].{{sfn|G\u00f3mez Couti\u00f1o|2014|p=18}} The Dominicans promoted the veneration of [[James, son of Zebedee#Spain|Santiago Matamoros]] (St. James the Moor-slayer) as a readily identifiable image of Spanish military superiority.{{sfn|G\u00f3mez Couti\u00f1o|2014|pp=25\u201326}} The Dominicans soon saw the need to reestablish themselves in Ciudad Real, and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed.{{sfn|G\u00f3mez Couti\u00f1o|2014|pp=19\u201320}} In 1547, the first stone for the new Dominican convent in Ciudad Real was placed.{{sfn|G\u00f3mez Couti\u00f1o|2014|pp=20\u201321}}\n\n==Francisco de Montejo and Alonso d'Avila, Yucat\u00e1n 1531\u201335==\n{{main|Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n}}\nMontejo was appointed ''[[Corregidor (position)|alcalde mayor]]'' (a local colonial governor) of Tabasco in 1529, and pacified that province with the aid of [[Francisco de Montejo the Younger|his son]], also named Francisco de Montejo.

After this battle, the younger Francisco de Montejo was despatched to the northern Cupul province, where the lord Naabon Cupul reluctantly allowed him to found the Spanish town of Ciudad Real at Chichen Itza. Montejo parcelled out the province amongst his soldiers as ''[[encomienda]]s''. After six months of Spanish rule, Naabon Cupul was killed during a failed attempt to kill Montejo the Younger. The death of their lord only served to inflame Cupul anger and, in mid 1533, they laid siege to the small Spanish garrison at Chichen Itza. Montejo the Younger abandoned Ciudad Real by night, and he and his men fled west, where the [[Cheles (chiefdom)|Chel]], [[Ceh Pech|Pech]] and Xiu provinces remained obedient to Spanish rule. Montejo the Younger was received in friendship by the lord of the Chel province. In the spring of 1534 he rejoined his father in the Chakan province at [[Dzikabal]], (near modern M\u00e9rida).{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=769}}\n\nThe Xiu Maya maintained their friendship with the Spanish throughout the conquest and Spanish authority was eventually established over Yucat\u00e1n in large part due to Xiu support. The Montejos founded a new Spanish town at Dzilam, although the Spanish suffered hardships there.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=769}} Montejo the Elder returned to Campeche, where he was received with friendship by the local Maya. He was accompanied by the friendly Chel lord Namux Chel.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=769\u2013770}} Montejo the Younger remained behind in Dzilam to continue his attempts at conquest of the region but soon retreated to Campeche to rejoin his father and Alonso d'Avila, who had returned to Campeche shortly beforehand. Around this time the news began to arrive of [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s conquests in Peru and the rich plunder there. Montejo's soldiers began to abandon him to seek their fortune elsewhere; in seven years of attempted conquest in the northern provinces of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, very little gold had been found. Towards the end of 1534 or the beginning of the next year, Montejo the Elder and his son retreated to Veracruz, taking their remaining soldiers with them.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=770}}\n\nMontejo the Elder became embroiled in colonial infighting over the right to rule Honduras, a claim that put him in conflict with Pedro de Alvarado, captain general of Guatemala, who also claimed Honduras as part of his jurisdiction. Alvarado was ultimately to prove successful. In Montejo the Elder's absence, first in central Mexico, and then in Honduras, Montejo the Younger acted as lieutenant governor and captain general in Tabasco.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=770}}\n\n===Conflict at Champoton===\nThe Franciscan [[friar]] [[Jacobo de Testera]] arrived in Champoton in 1535 to attempt the peaceful incorporation of Yucat\u00e1n into the Spanish Empire. His initial efforts were proving successful when Captain Lorenzo de Godoy arrived in Champoton at the command of soldiers despatched there by Montejo the Younger. Godoy and Testera were soon in conflict and the friar was forced to abandon Champoton and return to central Mexico.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=770}} Godoy's attempt to subdue the Maya around Champoton was unsuccessful,{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=770\u2013771}} so Montejo the Younger sent his cousin to take command; his diplomatic overtures to the Champoton Kowoj were successful and they submitted to Spanish rule.

By the time the Spanish physically arrived in the region this had collapsed to 150,000 because of the effects of the Old World diseases that had run ahead of them.{{sfn|Lovell|2005|p=71}}\n\n===Eastern Cuchumatanes, 1529\u20131530===\nAfter Zaculeu fell to the Spanish, the [[Ixil people|Ixil]] and [[Uspantek people|Uspantek]] Maya were sufficiently isolated to evade immediate Spanish attention. The Uspantek and the Ixil were allies and in 1529 Uspantek warriors were harassing Spanish forces and the city of [[Uspant\u00e1n]] was trying to foment rebellion among the K\u02bciche\u02bc; the Spanish decided that military action was necessary. [[Gaspar Arias]], [[alcalde|magistrate]] of Guatemala, penetrated the eastern Cuchumatanes with sixty Spanish infantry and three hundred allied indigenous warriors.{{sfn|Lovell|2005|p=64}} By early September he had imposed temporary Spanish authority over the Ixil towns of [[Chajul]] and [[Nebaj]].{{sfn|Lovell|2005|pp=64\u201365}} The Spanish army then marched east toward Uspant\u00e1n; Arias then handed command over to the inexperienced [[Pedro de Olmos]] and returned to the capital.

The expedition recruited further forces on the march north to the Cuchumatanes. On the steep southern slopes they clashed with between four and five thousand Ixil warriors; a lengthy battle followed during which the Spanish cavalry outflanked the Ixil army and forced them to retreat to their mountaintop fortress at Nebaj. The Spanish besieged the city, and their indigenous allies penetrated the stronghold and set it on fire. This allowed the Spanish to break the defences.{{sfn|Lovell|2005|p=65}} The victorious Spanish branded surviving warriors as [[Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|slaves]].{{sfn|Lovell|2005|pp=65\u201366}} The inhabitants of Chajul immediately capitulated to the Spanish as soon as news of the battle reached them.

Although heavily outnumbered, the Spanish cavalry and firearms decided the battle. The Spanish overran Uspant\u00e1n and again branded all surviving warriors as slaves.

The Ch\u02bcol of the Lacandon Jungle were resettled in [[Huehuetenango Department|Huehuetenango]] in the early 18th century.{{sfn|Jones|2000|p=365}} By 1699 the neighbouring Toquegua no longer existed as a separate people because of a combination of high mortality and intermarriage with the Amatique Indians.{{sfn|Feldman|1998|p=10}} At around this time the Spanish decided on the reduction of the independent Mopan Maya living to the north of Lake Izabal.{{sfn|Feldman|1998|pp=10\u201311}} Catholic priests from Yucat\u00e1n founded several mission towns around Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 in 1702\u20131703. Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled in 1704, but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed and most of the mission towns were abandoned. By 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Pet\u00e9n, compared to ten times that number in 1697.{{sfn|Jones|2009|p=59}} Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part.{{sfn|Jones|2009|p=60}}\n\n==Legacy of the Spanish conquest==\nThe initial shock of the Spanish conquest was followed by decades of heavy exploitation of the indigenous peoples, allies and foes alike.{{sfn|Restall|Asselbergs|2007|p=111}} Over the following two hundred years colonial rule gradually imposed Spanish cultural standards on the subjugated peoples. The Spanish ''reducciones'' created new nucleated settlements laid out in a grid pattern in the Spanish style, with a central plaza, a church and the town hall housing the civil government, known as the ''[[ayuntamiento]]''. This style of settlement can still be seen in the villages and towns of the area.{{sfn|Coe|1999|p=231}} The introduction of [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] was the main vehicle for cultural change, and resulted in religious [[syncretism]].{{sfn|Coe|1999|pp=231\u2013232}} Old World cultural elements came to be thoroughly adopted by Maya groups.{{sfn|Coe|1999|p=233}} The greatest change was replacement of the pre-Columbian economic order by European technology and livestock; this included the introduction of iron and steel tools to replace [[Neolithic]] tools, and of cattle, pigs and chickens. New crops were also introduced; however, sugarcane and [[Coffee production in Guatemala|coffee]] led to plantations that economically exploited native labour.{{sfn|Coe|1999|p=232}} Some indigenous elites such as the Xajil Kaqchikel noble family did manage to maintain a level of status into the colonial period.{{sfn|Restall|Asselbergs|2007|p=104}} During the second half of the 18th century, adult male Indians were heavily taxed, often being forced into [[Debt bondage|debt peonage]]. Western Pet\u00e9n and neighbouring Chiapas remained sparsely populated, and the Maya inhabitants avoided contact with the Spanish.{{sfn|Schwartz|1990|p=39}}\n\n==Historical sources==\n[[File:LienzodeTlaxcalaLamina5.jpg|thumb|left|A page from the ''[[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]]'', showing a Spanish conquistador accompanied by Tlaxcalan allies and a native porter|alt=Painting with three prominent indigenous warriors in single file facing left, wearing cloaks and grasping staves, followed by a dog.

Other accounts were in the form of questionnaires answered before colonial magistrates to protest and register a claim for recompense.{{sfn|Restall|Asselbergs|2007|pp=79\u201381}} Two pictorial accounts painted in the stylised indigenous pictographic tradition have survived; these are the ''[[Lienzo de Quauhquechollan]]'', and the ''[[History of Tlaxcala|Lienzo de Tlaxcala]]''.{{sfn|Restall|Asselbergs|2007|p=94}} Accounts of the conquest as seen from the point of view of the defeated highland Maya kingdoms are included in a number of indigenous documents, including the ''[[Annals of the Cakchiquels|Annals of the Kaqchikels]]''.{{sfn|Restall|Asselbergs|2007|pp=103\u2013104}} A letter from the defeated [[Tz\u02bcutujil people|Tz\u02bcutujil Maya]] nobility to the Spanish king written in 1571 details the exploitation of the subjugated peoples.{{sfn|Restall|Asselbergs|2007|p=111}}\n[[Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzm\u00e1n]] was a colonial Guatemalan historian of Spanish descent who wrote ''La Recordaci\u00f3n Florida''.
