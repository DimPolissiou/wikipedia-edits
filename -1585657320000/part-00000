Andy wants to talk to Haley about his feeling but her coming at Jay's with her new boyfriend makes things a little difficult for him.\n\n\"Grill, Interrupted\" received positive reviews from the critics.\n\n==Plot==\n\nGathering at Jay's ([[Ed O'Neill]]) house for his birthday, Claire ([[Julie Bowen]]) and Mitchell ([[Jesse Tyler Ferguson]]) decide to pay their father back the money he loaned them for the down payment on their respective houses. Mitchell intends on using the money that Cameron ([[Eric Stonestreet]]) has received from a recently deceased distant relative, and Phil ([[Ty Burrell]]) starts to believe the money problems are what have caused the slight rift between himself and Jay. After Phil's present (a new, state-of-the-art barbecue grill) backfires, he, Claire, Mitchell and Cameron all begin arguing in the driveway about the various monetary issues that have surfaced that day.\n\nLuke ([[Nolan Gould]]) and Manny ([[Rico Rodriguez (actor)|Rico Rodriguez]]) come up with a plan to steal and drink a bottle of Gloria's ([[Sofia Vergara]]) tequila. Before they can take it, she swaps it out with water so she can teach them a lesson, leaving Luke and Manny suffering a placebo intoxication. When they are \"drunk\" enough, Gloria makes them believe that the bottle of tequila had a deadly worm inside it that was probably got drunk by them. The only way to kill the worm once you had drunk it, is by taking an ice cold bath, something that Luke and Manny rush to do. Gloria appears and takes a photo of the boys being in the tub together, threatening them to post it online if they attempt to steal from her or get drunk underage again.\n\nMeanwhile, Andy ([[Adam Devine]]) wants to talk to Haley ([[Sarah Hyland]]) about his feelings, since it is the first time he will see her after the events of \"[[Closet? You'll Love It!]]\", where Haley told him that he has a shot with her while she thought he was sleeping. Andy is nervous and Haley appearing with her new boyfriend Will (Nick Ballard) does not help the situation. A series of mishaps leaves Andy and Haley in bed together and, later, Haley removing her clothes due to a drink spillage, but Will does not suspect Andy, nor feeling threatened by him. When Haley leaves the room, Will asks Andy to help him come up with a message for a card for Haley, but once Will leaves Haley struggles to read the handwriting. She asks Andy to read it to her and gets frustrated about how clingy Will is already after only two weeks of dating. Haley kisses Andy on the cheek and heads downstairs, leaving him both disappointed and hopeful.\n\nAlex ([[Ariel Winter]]) finds out she has been accepted into [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], but she is acting strange after her parents' reaction. Claire blames herself for never praising Alex's achievements because she expects them from her, and begins to overtly praise Alex in front of the whole family, leaving Alex embarrassed and irritated. Jay later finds her with a bottle of tequila, the placebo bottle that Gloria swapped out earlier with water, in his new car in the garage. When confronted, Jay explains the bottle of water in the tequila bottle, commenting that drinking will not help her with her problems. Alex expresses worry about being the least intelligent person at her new College and talks about how scared she is. Jay reassures her that she will do great at College and drives her out of the garage into the yard in front of the bickering family. He tells her that the family needs a leader and one day he will not be around to do it anymore, implying that in the future she will be the one to keep the family in check because she is the only one who can do it.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Ratings===\nIn its original American broadcast, \"Grill, Interrupted\" was watched by 9.43; up by 0.72 from the previous episode.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bibel|first1=Sara|title=Wednesday Final Ratings: 'American Idol', 'Survivor', 'The Middle', 'The Goldbergs', & 'Modern Family' Adjusted Up; 'The Mysteries of Laura' Adjusted Down|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/04/02/wednesday-final-ratings-american-idol-survivor-the-middle-the-goldbergs-the-mysteries-of-laura-adjusted-down/383554/|publisher=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=April 2, 2015|accessdate=May 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Reviews===\n\"Grill, Interrupted\" received positive reviews from the critics.\n\nDavid Kallison of ''[[The A.V.

Nearby is Ravenstor and [[Chee Dale]], both popular with [[Rock climbing in the Peak District|rock-climbers]]. Just to the north of the Dale lies the village of [[Wormhill]] and the lesser known valleys of Peter Dale and Monk's Dale, the latter being listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a nature reserve.\n\nThe local landmark is the viaduct, first built by the [[Midland Railway]] in 1866. Increasing traffic meant that a second viaduct parallel to the first was built in 1905, increasing the number of tracks to four. [[Millers Dale railway station]] was at the junction where passengers for [[Buxton railway station|Buxton]] joined or left the trains between [[London]] and [[Manchester]].\n\nThe area is of great interest to geologists, particularly where the strata have been exposed by quarries and railway cuttings.  In Station Quarry, which is owned by the Naturalists Trust, two layers of limestone can be seen, separated by a bed of shale. At one point there is a dip in the lower layer, possibly from a watercourse, millions of years ago. This is filled with the shale and a large limestone boulder can be seen within it. Elsewhere in the area there are signs of lava flows from long-ago volcanic activity.\n\nNorthwards from Millers Dale the line entered the two Chee Tor tunnels (401 and 94 yards), separated by a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} bridge over the River Wye, then along a ledge cut into the rock face, before entering Rusher Cutting Tunnel (121 yards), crossing the Wye yet again by another viaduct.

Some elements are directly involved in plant [[metabolism]]. However, this principle does not account for the so-called beneficial elements, whose presence, while not required, has clear positive effects on plant growth.\n\nA nutrient that is able to limit plant growth according to [[Liebig's law of the minimum]] is considered an essential plant nutrient if the plant cannot complete its full life cycle without it. There are 16 essential plant soil nutrients, besides the three major elemental nutrients carbon and oxygen that are obtained by photosynthetic plants from carbon dioxide in air, and [[hydrogen]], which is obtained from water.\n\nPlants uptake essential elements from the [[soil]] through their [[root]]s and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their [[Leaf|leaves]]. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by [[cation exchange]], wherein [[root hair]]s pump [[hydrogen ion]]s (H<sup>+</sup>) into the soil through [[proton pump]]s. These hydrogen ions displace [[cation]]s attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, [[stomata]] open to take in carbon dioxide and expel [[oxygen]]. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.\n\nAlthough [[nitrogen]] is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, very few plants can use this directly. Most plants, therefore, require nitrogen compounds to be present in the soil in which they grow. This is made possible by the fact that largely inert atmospheric nitrogen is changed in a [[nitrogen fixation]] process to biologically usable forms in the soil by bacteria.<ref>Lindemann, W.C. and Glover C.R.

Samaritans base it solely on a passage called the ''[[Haazinu#In Samaritan interpretation|Haazinu]]'' in the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], since they accept only the [[Torah]] and reject the rest of the Hebrew Bible.\n\nThe resurrection of the dead is a core belief in the [[Mishnah]] which was assembled in the early centuries of the Christian era.<ref>[[Jacob Neusner]], ''World Religions in America: An Introduction'' (2009), p. 133: \"He who says, the resurrection of the dead is a teaching which does not derive from the Torah. ...Excluded are those who deny the resurrection of the dead, or deny that the Torah teaches that the dead will live.\"</ref> The belief in resurrection is expressed on all occasions in the [[Jewish liturgy]]; e.g., in the [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings#Morning|morning prayer ''Elohai Neshamah'']], in the ''[[Shemoneh Esrei|Shemoneh 'Esreh]]'' and in the [[Bereavement in Judaism|funeral services]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=233&letter=R&search=Resurrection#656 |title=Resurrection: Jewish Creed or Not? |encyclopedia=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> [[Maimonides]] made it the last of his [[Thirteen Articles of Faith]]: \"I firmly believe that there will take place a revival of the dead at a time which will please the Creator, blessed be His name.\"<ref>David Birnbaum, Jews, Church & Civilization, Volume III (Millennium Education Foundation 2005), p. 157</ref>\n\nThere are three explicit examples in the Hebrew Bible of people being resurrected from the dead:\n* The prophet [[Elijah]] prays and God raises a young boy from death (1 Kings 17:17\u201324)\n* [[Elisha]] raises the son of the Shunammite woman (2 Kings 4:32\u201337); this was the very same child whose birth he previously foretold (2 Kings 4:8\u201316)\n* A dead man's body that was thrown into the dead Elisha's tomb is resurrected when the body touches Elisha's bones (2 Kings 13:21)\n\nDuring the [[Second Temple period]], Judaism developed a diversity of beliefs concerning the resurrection. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in [[2 Maccabees]], according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh.<ref>2 Maccabees 7.11, 7.28.</ref> Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical books of [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]],<ref>1 Enoch 61.5, 61.2.</ref> in [[Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch|Apocalypse of Baruch]],<ref>2 Baruch 50.2, 51.5</ref> and [[2 Esdras]]. According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism [[Philip R. Davies]], there is \"little or no clear reference \u2026 either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead\" in the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] texts.<ref>Philip R. Davies. \"Death, Resurrection and Life After Death in the Qumran Scrolls\" in Alan J. Avery-Peck & Jacob Neusner (eds.) ''Judaism in Late Antiquity: Part Four: Death, ''Life''-After-Death, Resurrection, and the World-To-Come in the Judaisms of Antiquity.'' Leiden 2000:209.</ref> Both [[Josephus]] and the New Testament record that the [[Sadducees]] did not believe in an [[afterlife]],<ref>Josephus Antiquities 18.16; Matthew 22.23; Mark 12.18; Luke 20.27; Acts 23.8.</ref> but the sources vary on the beliefs of the [[Pharisees]].

Andr\u00e9 Dartigues has observed that especially \"from the 17th to the 19th century, the language of popular piety no longer evoked the resurrection of the soul but [[Eternal life (Christianity)|everlasting life]]. Although theological textbooks still mentioned resurrection, they dealt with it as a speculative question more than as an existential problem.\"<ref name=\"Christian Theology Vol 2005\"/>\n\nThis shift was supported not by any scripture, but largely by the popular religion of the Enlightenment, [[deism]]. Deism allowed for a [[God|supreme being]], such as the philosophical [[first cause]], but denied any significant personal or relational interaction with this figure. Deism, which was largely led by rationality and reason, could allow a belief in the [[immortality of the soul]], but not necessarily in the resurrection of the dead. American deist [[Ethan Allen]] demonstrates this thinking in his work, ''[[Ethan Allen#Publications|Reason the Only Oracle of Man]]'' (1784) where he argues in the preface that nearly every philosophical problem is beyond humanity's understanding, including the miracles of Christianity, although he does allow for the immortality of an immaterial soul.<ref>The Encyclopedia of Unbelief, Vol. 1, A\u2013K, \"Deism,\" Edited by [[Gordon Stein]] (Buffalo, NY: Prometheus Books, 1985), 134.</ref>\n\n===Influence on secular law and custom===\nIn Christian theology, it was once widely believed that to rise on [[Judgment Day]] the body had to be whole and preferably [[Burial#Orientation|buried with the feet to the east]] so that the person would rise facing God.<ref>[[Barbara Yorke]] (2006), ''The Conversion of Britain''  Pearson Education, {{ISBN|0-582-77292-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-582-77292-2}}.

The doctrinal premises are (1) good will eventually prevail over evil; (2) creation was initially perfectly good, but was subsequently corrupted by evil; (3) the world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it had at the time of creation; (4) the \"salvation for the individual depended on the sum of (that person's) thoughts, words and deeds, and there could be no intervention, whether compassionate or capricious, by any divine being to alter this.\" Thus, each human bears the responsibility for the fate of his own soul, and simultaneously shares in the responsibility for the fate of the world.<ref name=\"Boyce\">{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|authorlink=Mary Boyce|title=Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|year=1979|location=London|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-415-23902-8|pages=27\u201329|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6gbxVfjtUEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Religion}}\n* [[Dying-and-rising god]]\n* [[Posthumous execution]]\n* [[Preterism]]\n* [[Technological resurrection]]\n\n==Footnotes== \n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References== \n* {{cite book|last1=Abbott-Smith|first1=George|title=A Manual Greek Lexicon of the New Testament|date=1999|publisher=T&T Clark|location=Edinburgh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W35be0rYh8cC&pg=PA33|isbn=9780567086846|page=33|edition=3rd|ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book|last1=Insight|title=Insight on the Scriptures, Vol. 1|date=1988|publisher=[[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania]]|location=Pennsylvania|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200003709|pages=783\u2013793|ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book|last1=Strong|first1=James|authorlink=James Strong (theologian)|title=Strong's exhaustive concordance of the Bible|date=2007|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|location=Peabody, MA|isbn=9781565633599|edition=Updated|ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book|last1=Thayer|first1=Joseph Henry|authorlink=Joseph Henry Thayer|title=Thayer's Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament|date=1890|publisher=Hendrickson|location=Peabody, Mass.|isbn=9780913573228|url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G386&t=KJV|ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12792a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: General Resurrection]\n* George A.
