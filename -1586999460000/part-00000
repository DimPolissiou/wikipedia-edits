Concern over this freedom was a major topic of [[George Washington's Farewell Address#Religion, morality, and education|George Washington's Farewell Address]]. Illegal religion was a major cause of the 1890\u20131891 [[Ghost Dance War]]. Starting in 1918, nearly all of the pacifist Hutterites emigrated to Canada when [[Joseph and Michael Hofer]] died following torture at [[Fort Leavenworth]] for conscientious objection to the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]]. Some have since returned, but most Hutterites remain in Canada.\n\nThe long-term trend has been towards increasing secularization of the government. The remaining state churches were [[State religion#Disestablishment|disestablished]] in 1820 and teacher-led public school prayer was abolished in 1962, but the military chaplaincy remains to the present day. Although most Supreme Court rulings have been [[Accommodationism|accommodationist]] towards religion, in recent years there have been attempts to replace the freedom of religion with the more limited freedom of worship. Although the freedom of religion includes some form of recognition to the individual [[Conscience#Conscientious acts and the law|conscience]] of each citizen with the possibility of [[conscientious objection]] to law or policy, the freedom of worship does not.\n\nControversies surrounding the freedom of religion in the US have included building places of worship, compulsory speech, prohibited counseling, compulsory consumerism, workplace, marriage and the family, the choosing of religious leaders, circumcision of male infants, dress, education, oaths, praying for sick people, medical care, worshiping during quarantines, use of government lands sacred to Native Americans, the protection of graves, the bodily use of sacred substances, [[Internment of Japanese Americans#Facilities|mass incarceration of clergy]], both animal slaughter for meat and the use of living animals, and accommodations for employees, prisoners, and military personnel.\n\n==Legal and public foundation==\nThe [[United States Constitution]] addresses the issue of religion in two places: in the First Amendment, and the Article VI [[No religious test clause|prohibition on religious tests]] as a condition for holding public office. The First Amendment prohibits the Congress  from making a law \"respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\".  This provision was later expanded to state and local governments, through the [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporation]] of the First Amendment.\n\n===Colonial precedents===\nThe October 10, 1645, charter of [[Flushing, Queens]], New York, allowed \"liberty of conscience, according to the custom and practice of Holland without molestation or disturbance from any magistrate or ecclesiastical minister.\" However, New Amsterdam Director-General [[Peter Stuyvesant]] issued an edict prohibiting the harboring of Quakers. On December 27, 1657, the inhabitants of Flushing approved a protest known as The [[Flushing Remonstrance]]. This contained religious arguments even mentioning freedom for \"Jews, Turks, and Egyptians,\" but ended with a forceful declaration that any infringement of the town charter would not be tolerated.\n \nFreedom of religion was first applied as a principle in the founding of the colony of Maryland, also  founded by the Catholic [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]], in 1634.<ref name=\"Symbol of Enduring Freedom\">Zimmerman, Mark, [http://issuu.com/columbia-magazine/docs/columbiamar10en?mode=embed&layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&showFlipBtn=true Symbol of Enduring Freedom], p. 19, Columbia Magazine, March 2010</ref> Fifteen years  later (1649), an enactment of religious liberty, the [[Maryland Toleration Act]], drafted by Lord Baltimore, provided: \"No person or persons ... shall from henceforth be any waies troubled, molested or discountenanced for or in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof.\"  The Maryland Toleration Act was repealed with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen and a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion was passed.<ref>Brugger, Robert J.

The inseparable connection of [[democracy]], freedom of religion, and the other forms of freedom became the political and legal basis of the new nation. In particular, [[Baptists in the history of separation of church and state|Baptists]] and [[Presbyterians]] demanded vigorously and successfully the [[disestablishment]] of the [[Anglican]] and Congregational [[state churches]] that had existed in most colonies since the seventeenth century.<ref>[[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-516247-9}}, p. 635</ref>\n\n===The First Amendment===\n\nIn the United States, the religious civil liberties are guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution:\n\n{{quote|Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.}}\n\nThe \"[[Establishment Clause]],\" stating that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\" is generally read to prohibit the Federal government from establishing a national church (\"religion\") or excessively involving itself in religion, particularly to the benefit of one religion over another. Following the ratification of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and through the doctrine of [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporation]], this restriction is held to be applicable to state governments as well.\n\nThe \"[[Free Exercise Clause]]\" states that Congress cannot \"prohibit the free exercise\" of religious practices. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has consistently held, however, that the right to free exercise of religion is not absolute. For example, in the 19th century, some of the members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] traditionally practiced [[polygamy]], yet in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'' (1879), the Supreme Court upheld the criminal conviction of one of these members under a federal law banning polygamy. The Court reasoned that to do otherwise would set precedent for a full range of religious beliefs including those as extreme as human sacrifice. The Court stated that \"''Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinions, they may with practices.''\" For example, if one were part of a religion that believed in [[Vampire|vampirism]], the First Amendment would protect one's belief in vampirism, but not the practice.\n\n===The Fourteenth Amendment===\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the religious civil rights.<ref>For the distinction between religious civil liberties and religious civil rights, see e.g.: ''Religious discrimination. A neglected issue. A consultation sponsored by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Washington D.C., April 9\u201311, 1979''. Preface</ref> Whereas the First Amendment secures the free exercise of religion, section one of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits discrimination, including on the basis of religion, by securing \"the equal protection of the laws\" for every person:\n\n{{quote|All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction there of, are citizens of the United States and of the State where in they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.}}\n\nThis amendment was cited in ''[[Meyer v.

Advocates for stronger [[separation of church and state]], such as already exists in France with the practice of [[la\u00efcit\u00e9]], emphasize the plurality of faiths and non-faiths in the country, and what they see as broad guarantees of the federal Constitution. Their opponents emphasize what they see as the largely Christian heritage and history of the nation (often citing the references to \"Nature's God\" and the \"Creator\" of men in the Declaration of Independence and the dating of the Constitution with the phrase \"in the Year of our Lord\"). Some more socially conservative Christian sects, such as the Christian Reconstructionist movement, oppose the concept of a \"wall of separation\" and prefer a closer relationship between church and state.\n\nProblems also arise in U.S. public schools concerning the teaching and display of religious issues. In various counties, [[school choice]] and [[school vouchers]] have been put forward as solutions to accommodate variety in beliefs and freedom of religion, by allowing individual school boards to choose between a secular, religious or multi-faith vocation, and allowing parents free choice among these schools. Critics of American voucher programs claim that they take funds away from public schools, and that the amount of funds given by vouchers is not enough to help many middle and working-class parents.\n\nU.S. judges often ordered alcoholic defendants to attend [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] or face imprisonment. However, in 1999, a federal appeals court ruled this unconstitutional because the A.A. program relies on submission to a \"Higher Power\".<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Warner v.

In accordance with [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article VI]] of the Constitution, on that date this treaty became incorporated as part of \"the supreme Law of the Land\".\n\n==Supreme Court rulings==\n\n===Jehovah's Witnesses===\n\nSince the 1940s, the Jehovah's Witnesses have often invoked the First Amendment's freedom of religion clauses to protect their ability to engage in the proselytizing (or preaching) that is central to their faith.  This series of litigation has helped to define civil liberties case law in the United States and Canada.\n\nIn the United States of America and several other countries, the legal struggles of the Jehovah's Witnesses have yielded some of the most important judicial decisions regarding [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of press|press]] and [[freedom of speech|speech]].  In the United States, many [[Supreme Court cases involving Jehovah's Witnesses by country#United States|Supreme Court cases involving Jehovah's Witnesses]] are now landmark decisions of First Amendment law.  Of the 72 cases involving the Jehovah's Witnesses that have been brought before the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court has ruled in favor of them 47 times.  Even the cases that the Jehovah's Witnesses lost helped the U.S. to more clearly define the limits of First Amendment rights.  Former Supreme Court Justice [[Harlan Stone]] jokingly suggested \"The Jehovah's Witnesses ought to have an endowment in view of the aid which they give in solving the legal problems of civil liberties.\"  \"Like it or not,\" observed American author and editor Irving Dilliard, \"Jehovah's Witnesses have done more to help preserve our freedoms than any other religious group.\"\n\nProfessor C. S. Braden wrote: \"They have performed a signal service to democracy by their fight to preserve their civil rights, for in their struggle they have done much to secure those rights for every minority group in America.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=These Also Believe |first=C.S. |last=Braden |isbn=0-02-514360-3}}</ref>\n\n\"The cases that the Witnesses were involved in formed the bedrock of 1st Amendment protections for all citizens,\" said Paul Polidoro, a lawyer who argued the Watchtower Society's case before the Supreme Court in February 2002.  \"These cases were a good vehicle for the courts to address the protections that were to be accorded free speech, the free press and free exercise of religion.  In addition, the cases marked the emergence of individual rights as an issue within the U.S. court system.\n\nBefore the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] brought several dozen cases before the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1930s and 1940s, the Court had handled few cases contesting laws that restricted [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of religion]]. Until then, the First Amendment had only been applied to [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the federal government.\n\nHowever, the cases brought before the Court by the Jehovah's Witnesses allowed the Court to consider a range of issues: mandatory flag salute, sedition, free speech, literature distribution and military draft law. These cases proved to be pivotal moments in the formation of [[constitutional law]].  Jehovah's Witnesses' court victories have strengthened rights including the protection of religious conduct from federal and state interference, the right to abstain from patriotic rituals and military service and the right to engage in public discourse.\n\nDuring the World War II era, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Jehovah's Witnesses in several landmark cases that helped pave the way for the modern civil rights movement.  In all, Jehovah's Witnesses brought 23 separate First Amendment actions before the U.S. Supreme Court between 1938 and 1946.\n\n===Lemon test===\nThe [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] has consistently held fast to the rule of strict separation of church and state when matters of prayer are involved.\nIn ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' (1962) the Court ruled that government-imposed nondenominational prayer in public school was unconstitutional. In ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'' (1992), the Court ruled prayer established by a school principal at a middle school graduation was also unconstitutional, and in ''[[Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe]]'' (2000) it ruled that school officials may not directly impose student-led prayer during high school football games nor establish an official student election process for the purpose of indirectly establishing such prayer. The distinction between force of government and individual liberty is the cornerstone of such cases. Each case restricts acts by government designed to establish prayer while explicitly or implicitly affirming students' individual freedom to pray.\n\nThe Court has therefore tried to determine a way to deal with church/state questions.  In ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'' (1971), the Court created a three-part test for laws dealing with religious establishment.  This determined that a law was constitutional if it:\n# Had a [[secular]] purpose\n# Neither advanced nor inhibited religion\n# Did not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.\n\nSome examples of where inhibiting religion has been struck down:\n\n* In ''Widmar v. Vincent'', 454 U.S. 263 (1981), the Court ruled that a Missouri law prohibiting religious groups from using state university grounds and buildings for religious worship was unconstitutional. As a result, Congress decided in 1984 that this should apply to secondary and primary schools as well, passing the [[Equal Access Act]], which prevents public schools from discriminating against students based on \"religious, political, philosophical or other content of the speech at such meetings\".  In Board of Education of ''Westside Community Schools v. Mergens'', 496 U.S. 226, 236 (1990), the Court upheld this law when it ruled that a school board's refusal to allow a Christian Bible club to meet in a public high school classroom violated the act.\n* In ''[[Good News Club v. Milford Central School]]'', 533 U.S. 98 (2001), the Court ruled that religious groups must be allowed to use public schools after hours if the same access is granted to other community groups.\n* In ''[[Rosenberger v. University of Virginia|Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia]]'', 515 U.S. 819 (1995), the Supreme Court found that the [[University of Virginia]] was unconstitutionally withholding funds from a religious student magazine.\n\n===Wisconsin v.

Therefore, the states must guarantee the freedom of religion in the same way the federal government must.\n\nMany states have freedom of religion established in their constitution, though the exact legal consequences of this right vary for historical and cultural reasons. Most states interpret \"freedom of religion\" as including the freedom of long-established [[religious communities]] to remain intact and not be destroyed. By extension, [[Liberal democracy|democracies]] interpret \"freedom of religion\" as the right of each individual to freely choose to [[Religious conversion|convert]] from one religion to another, [[Syncretism|mix]] religions, or [[Irreligion|abandon religion]] altogether.\n\n==Public offices and the military==\n===Religious tests===\n{{Main|Religious qualifications for public office in the United States|No Religious Test Clause}}\nThe affirmation or denial of specific religious beliefs had, in the past, been made into qualifications for public office; however, the United States Constitution states that the inauguration of a president may include an \"affirmation\" of the faithful execution of his duties rather than an \"oath\" to that effect \u2014 this provision was included in order to respect the religious prerogatives of the [[Quakers]], a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] denomination that declines the swearing of [[oaths]].

As a result, the possession of eagle feathers is restricted to ethnic Native Americans, a policy that is seen as controversial for several reasons.\n*[[Peyote]], a spineless cactus found in the desert southwest and [[Mexico]], is commonly used in certain traditions of Native American religion and spirituality, most notably in the [[Native American Church]].  Prior to the passage of the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] (AIRFA) in 1978, and as amended in 1994, the religious use of peyote was not afforded legal protection. This resulted in the arrest of many Native Americans and non-Native Americans participating in traditional indigenous religion and spirituality.\n*Native Americans often hold strong personal and spiritual connections to their ancestors and often believe that their remains should rest undisturbed. This has often placed Native Americans at odds with archaeologists who have often dug on Native American burial grounds and other sites considered sacred, often removing artifacts and human remains \u2013 an act considered sacrilegious by many Native Americans. For years, Native American communities decried the removal of ancestral human remains and cultural and religious objects, charging that such activities are acts of [[genocide]], religious persecution, and [[discrimination]]. Many Native Americans called on the government, museums, and private collectors for the return of remains and sensitive objects for reburial. The [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA), which gained passage in 1990, established a means for Native Americans to request the return or \"repatriation\" of human remains and other sensitive cultural, religious, and funerary items held by federal agencies and federally assisted museums and institutions.\n\n===Atheists===\n{{further|Discrimination against atheists in the United States}}\n{{See also|Religion in the United States#Agnosticism, atheism, and humanism}}\nA 2006 study at the [[University of Minnesota]] showed atheists to be the most distrusted minority among Americans.

Freedom of religion is also closely associated with [[separation of church and state]], a concept advocated by Colonial founders such as [[John Clarke (Baptist minister)|Dr. John Clarke]], [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], [[William Penn]] and later Founding Fathers such as  [[James Madison]] and  [[Thomas Jefferson]].<ref>\n\n{{cite web\n| url = https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html\n| title = Jefferson's Letter to the Danbury Baptists\n| accessdate = 2006-11-30\n| last = Jefferson\n| first = Thomas\n| date = 1802-01-01\n| publisher = U.S. Library of Congress}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel06-2.html\n| title = The State Becomes the Church: Jefferson and Madison| accessdate = 2015-02-17\n| publisher = U.S. Library of Congress}}</ref>\n\nThe freedom of religion has changed over time in the United States and continues to be controversial. Concern over this freedom was a major topic of [[George Washington's Farewell Address#Religion, morality, and education|George Washington's Farewell Address]]. Illegal religion was a major cause of the 1890\u20131891 [[Ghost Dance War]]. Starting in 1918, nearly all of the pacifist Hutterites emigrated to Canada when [[Joseph and Michael Hofer]] died following torture at [[Fort Leavenworth]] for conscientious objection to the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]]. Some have since returned, but most Hutterites remain in Canada.\n\nThe long-term trend has been towards increasing secularization of the government. The remaining state churches were [[State religion#Disestablishment|disestablished]] in 1820 and teacher-led public school prayer was abolished in 1962, but the military chaplaincy remains to the present day. Although most Supreme Court rulings have been [[Accommodationism|accommodationist]] towards religion, in recent years there have been attempts to replace the freedom of religion with the more limited freedom of worship. Although the freedom of religion includes some form of recognition to the individual [[Conscience#Conscientious acts and the law|conscience]] of each citizen with the possibility of [[conscientious objection]] to law or policy, the freedom of worship does not.\n\nControversies surrounding the freedom of religion in the US have included building places of worship, compulsory speech, prohibited counseling, compulsory consumerism, workplace, marriage and the family, the choosing of religious leaders, circumcision of male infants, dress, education, oaths, praying for sick people, medical care, worshiping during quarantines, use of government lands sacred to Native Americans, the protection of graves, the bodily use of sacred substances, [[Internment of Japanese Americans#Facilities|mass incarceration of clergy]], both animal slaughter for meat and the use of living animals, and accommodations for employees, prisoners, and military personnel.\n\n==Legal and public foundation==\nThe [[United States Constitution]] addresses the issue of religion in two places: in the First Amendment, and the Article VI [[No religious test clause|prohibition on religious tests]] as a condition for holding public office. The First Amendment prohibits the Congress  from making a law \"respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\".  This provision was later expanded to state and local governments, through the [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporation]] of the First Amendment.\n\n===Colonial precedents===\nThe October 10, 1645, charter of [[Flushing, Queens]], New York, allowed \"liberty of conscience, according to the custom and practice of Holland without molestation or disturbance from any magistrate or ecclesiastical minister.\" However, New Amsterdam Director-General [[Peter Stuyvesant]] issued an edict prohibiting the harboring of Quakers. On December 27, 1657, the inhabitants of Flushing approved a protest known as The [[Flushing Remonstrance]]. This contained religious arguments even mentioning freedom for \"Jews, Turks, and Egyptians,\" but ended with a forceful declaration that any infringement of the town charter would not be tolerated.\n \nFreedom of religion was first applied as a principle in the founding of the colony of Maryland, also  founded by the Catholic [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Lord Baltimore]], in 1634.<ref name=\"Symbol of Enduring Freedom\">Zimmerman, Mark, [http://issuu.com/columbia-magazine/docs/columbiamar10en?mode=embed&layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&showFlipBtn=true Symbol of Enduring Freedom], p. 19, Columbia Magazine, March 2010</ref> Fifteen years  later (1649), an enactment of religious liberty, the [[Maryland Toleration Act]], drafted by Lord Baltimore, provided: \"No person or persons ... shall from henceforth be any waies troubled, molested or discountenanced for or in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof.\"  The Maryland Toleration Act was repealed with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen and a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion was passed.<ref>Brugger, Robert J.

Williams gave the most profound theological reason: As faith is the free gift of the Holy Spirit, it cannot be forced upon a person. Therefore, strict [[separation of church and state]] has to be kept.<ref>Heinrich Bornkamm, ''Toleranz. In der Geschichte des Christentums'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', 3. Auflage, Band VI (1962), col. 943</ref> Pennsylvania was the only colony that retained unlimited religious freedom until the foundation of the United States. The inseparable connection of [[democracy]], freedom of religion, and the other forms of freedom became the political and legal basis of the new nation. In particular, [[Baptists in the history of separation of church and state|Baptists]] and [[Presbyterians]] demanded vigorously and successfully the [[disestablishment]] of the [[Anglican]] and Congregational [[state churches]] that had existed in most colonies since the seventeenth century.<ref>[[Robert Middlekauff]] (2005), ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789'', Revised and Expanded Edition, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-516247-9}}, p. 635</ref>\n\n===The First Amendment===\n\nIn the United States, the religious civil liberties are guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution:\n\n{{quote|Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.}}\n\nThe \"[[Establishment Clause]],\" stating that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\" is generally read to prohibit the Federal government from establishing a national church (\"religion\") or excessively involving itself in religion, particularly to the benefit of one religion over another. Following the ratification of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and through the doctrine of [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporation]], this restriction is held to be applicable to state governments as well.\n\nThe \"[[Free Exercise Clause]]\" states that Congress cannot \"prohibit the free exercise\" of religious practices. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has consistently held, however, that the right to free exercise of religion is not absolute. For example, in the 19th century, some of the members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] traditionally practiced [[polygamy]], yet in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'' (1879), the Supreme Court upheld the criminal conviction of one of these members under a federal law banning polygamy. The Court reasoned that to do otherwise would set precedent for a full range of religious beliefs including those as extreme as human sacrifice. The Court stated that \"''Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinions, they may with practices.''\" For example, if one were part of a religion that believed in [[Vampire|vampirism]], the First Amendment would protect one's belief in vampirism, but not the practice.\n\n===The Fourteenth Amendment===\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the religious civil rights.<ref>For the distinction between religious civil liberties and religious civil rights, see e.g.: ''Religious discrimination. A neglected issue. A consultation sponsored by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, Washington D.C., April 9\u201311, 1979''. Preface</ref> Whereas the First Amendment secures the free exercise of religion, section one of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits discrimination, including on the basis of religion, by securing \"the equal protection of the laws\" for every person:\n\n{{quote|All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction there of, are citizens of the United States and of the State where in they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.}}\n\nThis amendment was cited in ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'', striking down laws which banned education in the German language. These laws mainly affected church schools teaching in German. Some laws, such is in Montana, forbade preaching in German during church.<ref>''Germans in the New World: Essays in the History of Immigration'' By Frederick C.

California's ban lasted into the mid-1920s.  German was banned again in California churches in 1941.\n\n===The \"wall of separation\"===\n[[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote that the First Amendment erected a \"[[wall of separation]] between church and state\" likely borrowing the language from [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], founder of the [[First Baptist Church in America]] and the Colony of Rhode Island, who used the phrase in his 1644 book, ''[[The Bloody Tenent of Persecution]]''.<ref>Feldman, Noah (2005).

Advocates for stronger [[separation of church and state]], such as already exists in France with the practice of [[la\u00efcit\u00e9]], emphasize the plurality of faiths and non-faiths in the country, and what they see as broad guarantees of the federal Constitution. Their opponents emphasize what they see as the largely Christian heritage and history of the nation (often citing the references to \"Nature's God\" and the \"Creator\" of men in the Declaration of Independence and the dating of the Constitution with the phrase \"in the Year of our Lord\"). Some more socially conservative Christian sects, such as the Christian Reconstructionist movement, oppose the concept of a \"wall of separation\" and prefer a closer relationship between church and state.\n\nProblems also arise in U.S. public schools concerning the teaching and display of religious issues. In various counties, [[school choice]] and [[school vouchers]] have been put forward as solutions to accommodate variety in beliefs and freedom of religion, by allowing individual school boards to choose between a secular, religious or multi-faith vocation, and allowing parents free choice among these schools. Critics of American voucher programs claim that they take funds away from public schools, and that the amount of funds given by vouchers is not enough to help many middle and working-class parents.\n\nU.S. judges often ordered alcoholic defendants to attend [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] or face imprisonment. However, in 1999, a federal appeals court ruled this unconstitutional because the A.A. program relies on submission to a \"Higher Power\".<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Warner v.

He created the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], which has since been incorporated into the Virginia State Constitution.\n\n===Other statements===\n\n====Inalienable rights====\nThe United States of America was established on foundational principles by the Declaration of Independence:<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/declare.htm\n|title=Declaration of Independence : July 4, 1776\n|publisher=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School\n|accessdate=2007-04-18\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428014918/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/declare.htm\n|archive-date=April 28, 2007\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>We hold these truths to be self-evident:\nThat all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that, to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed; (based on Thomas Jefferson's draft.)<ref>[https://jeffersonpapers.princeton.edu/selected-documents/jefferson%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Coriginal-rough-draught%E2%80%9D-declaration-independence Jefferson\u2019s \u201coriginal Rough draught\u201d of the Declaration of Independence] The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Volume 1: 1760-1776.

In accordance with [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article VI]] of the Constitution, on that date this treaty became incorporated as part of \"the supreme Law of the Land\".\n\n==Supreme Court rulings==\n\n===Jehovah's Witnesses===\n\nSince the 1940s, the Jehovah's Witnesses have often invoked the First Amendment's freedom of religion clauses to protect their ability to engage in the proselytizing (or preaching) that is central to their faith.  This series of litigation has helped to define civil liberties case law in the United States and Canada.\n\nIn the United States of America and several other countries, the legal struggles of the Jehovah's Witnesses have yielded some of the most important judicial decisions regarding [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of press|press]] and [[freedom of speech|speech]].  In the United States, many [[Supreme Court cases involving Jehovah's Witnesses by country#United States|Supreme Court cases involving Jehovah's Witnesses]] are now landmark decisions of First Amendment law.  Of the 72 cases involving the Jehovah's Witnesses that have been brought before the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court has ruled in favor of them 47 times.  Even the cases that the Jehovah's Witnesses lost helped the U.S. to more clearly define the limits of First Amendment rights.  Former Supreme Court Justice [[Harlan Stone]] jokingly suggested \"The Jehovah's Witnesses ought to have an endowment in view of the aid which they give in solving the legal problems of civil liberties.\"  \"Like it or not,\" observed American author and editor Irving Dilliard, \"Jehovah's Witnesses have done more to help preserve our freedoms than any other religious group.\"\n\nProfessor C. S. Braden wrote: \"They have performed a signal service to democracy by their fight to preserve their civil rights, for in their struggle they have done much to secure those rights for every minority group in America.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=These Also Believe |first=C.S. |last=Braden |isbn=0-02-514360-3}}</ref>\n\n\"The cases that the Witnesses were involved in formed the bedrock of 1st Amendment protections for all citizens,\" said Paul Polidoro, a lawyer who argued the Watchtower Society's case before the Supreme Court in February 2002.  \"These cases were a good vehicle for the courts to address the protections that were to be accorded free speech, the free press and free exercise of religion.  In addition, the cases marked the emergence of individual rights as an issue within the U.S. court system.\n\nBefore the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] brought several dozen cases before the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1930s and 1940s, the Court had handled few cases contesting laws that restricted [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of religion]]. Until then, the First Amendment had only been applied to [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the federal government.\n\nHowever, the cases brought before the Court by the Jehovah's Witnesses allowed the Court to consider a range of issues: mandatory flag salute, sedition, free speech, literature distribution and military draft law. These cases proved to be pivotal moments in the formation of [[constitutional law]].  Jehovah's Witnesses' court victories have strengthened rights including the protection of religious conduct from federal and state interference, the right to abstain from patriotic rituals and military service and the right to engage in public discourse.\n\nDuring the World War II era, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Jehovah's Witnesses in several landmark cases that helped pave the way for the modern civil rights movement.  In all, Jehovah's Witnesses brought 23 separate First Amendment actions before the U.S. Supreme Court between 1938 and 1946.\n\n===Lemon test===\nThe [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] has consistently held fast to the rule of strict separation of church and state when matters of prayer are involved.\nIn ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'' (1962) the Court ruled that government-imposed nondenominational prayer in public school was unconstitutional. In ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]'' (1992), the Court ruled prayer established by a school principal at a middle school graduation was also unconstitutional, and in ''[[Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe]]'' (2000) it ruled that school officials may not directly impose student-led prayer during high school football games nor establish an official student election process for the purpose of indirectly establishing such prayer. The distinction between force of government and individual liberty is the cornerstone of such cases. Each case restricts acts by government designed to establish prayer while explicitly or implicitly affirming students' individual freedom to pray.\n\nThe Court has therefore tried to determine a way to deal with church/state questions.  In ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'' (1971), the Court created a three-part test for laws dealing with religious establishment.  This determined that a law was constitutional if it:\n# Had a [[secular]] purpose\n# Neither advanced nor inhibited religion\n# Did not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.\n\nSome examples of where inhibiting religion has been struck down:\n\n* In ''Widmar v. Vincent'', 454 U.S. 263 (1981), the Court ruled that a Missouri law prohibiting religious groups from using state university grounds and buildings for religious worship was unconstitutional. As a result, Congress decided in 1984 that this should apply to secondary and primary schools as well, passing the [[Equal Access Act]], which prevents public schools from discriminating against students based on \"religious, political, philosophical or other content of the speech at such meetings\".  In Board of Education of ''Westside Community Schools v. Mergens'', 496 U.S. 226, 236 (1990), the Court upheld this law when it ruled that a school board's refusal to allow a Christian Bible club to meet in a public high school classroom violated the act.\n* In ''[[Good News Club v. Milford Central School]]'', 533 U.S. 98 (2001), the Court ruled that religious groups must be allowed to use public schools after hours if the same access is granted to other community groups.\n* In ''[[Rosenberger v. University of Virginia|Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia]]'', 515 U.S. 819 (1995), the Supreme Court found that the [[University of Virginia]] was unconstitutionally withholding funds from a religious student magazine.\n\n===Wisconsin v.

As a result, the possession of eagle feathers is restricted to ethnic Native Americans, a policy that is seen as controversial for several reasons.\n*[[Peyote]], a spineless cactus found in the desert southwest and [[Mexico]], is commonly used in certain traditions of Native American religion and spirituality, most notably in the [[Native American Church]].  Prior to the passage of the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]] (AIRFA) in 1978, and as amended in 1994, the religious use of peyote was not afforded legal protection. This resulted in the arrest of many Native Americans and non-Native Americans participating in traditional indigenous religion and spirituality.\n*Native Americans often hold strong personal and spiritual connections to their ancestors and often believe that their remains should rest undisturbed. This has often placed Native Americans at odds with archaeologists who have often dug on Native American burial grounds and other sites considered sacred, often removing artifacts and human remains \u2013 an act considered sacrilegious by many Native Americans. For years, Native American communities decried the removal of ancestral human remains and cultural and religious objects, charging that such activities are acts of [[genocide]], religious persecution, and [[discrimination]]. Many Native Americans called on the government, museums, and private collectors for the return of remains and sensitive objects for reburial. The [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA), which gained passage in 1990, established a means for Native Americans to request the return or \"repatriation\" of human remains and other sensitive cultural, religious, and funerary items held by federal agencies and federally assisted museums and institutions.\n\n===Atheists===\n{{further|Discrimination against atheists in the United States}}\n{{See also|Religion in the United States#Agnosticism, atheism, and humanism}}\nA 2006 study at the [[University of Minnesota]] showed atheists to be the most distrusted minority among Americans.

That's a lot cheaper than Apple's entry-level iPad Mini 2, with a 7.9 inch screen and $269 price tag.\n-->\n\nForrester says its definition of tablets \"is relatively narrow\" while IDC says it includes some tablets by Amazon \u2014 but not all.[..]\n<!--\nThis year e-tailer Amazon turned a lot of heads by drastically lowering the price of tablets, offering the 7-inch Fire for $49.99. In its roster of holiday best sellers, Amazon said this Fire was its best-selling tablet in December.\n\nFor consumers, buying a new tablet was \"an impulse purchase,\" says Doherty. If your kid sits on the tablet and breaks it, you wouldn\u2019t dream of getting it fixed \u2014 they\u2019re so cheap, you just buy a new one.\"\n-->\n\nThe top tech purchase of the year continued to be the smartphone, with an expected 1.5 billion sold worldwide, according to projections from researcher IDC. Last year saw some 1.2 billion sold.[..]\n\nComputers didn\u2019t fare as well, despite the introduction of Microsoft's latest software upgrade, Windows 10, and the expected but not realized bump it would provide for consumers looking to skip the upgrade and just get a new computer instead.\n\nSome 281 million PCs were expected to be sold, according to IDC, down from 308 million in 2014.

other desktop operating systems (not just to mobile) with the slide very noticeable in the US, where macOS usage has more than tripled from 2009 to 2017, with Windows down to 72.76% and Chrome OS at 3.33%, plus traditional Linux at 1.46%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/united-states-of-america/#monthly-200901-201905|title=Desktop Operating System Market

shipments of desktop and laptop computers. Gartner publishes estimates, but the way the estimates are calculated is not openly published. Another source of market share of various operating systems is [[StatCounter]]<ref>https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-monthly-201508-201508-bar StatCounter</ref> basing its estimate on web use (although this may not be [[Usage share of web browsers#Accuracy|very accurate]]). Also, sales may overstate usage. Most computers are sold with a [[Pre-installed software|pre-installed operating system]], with some users replacing that OS with a different one due to personal preference, or installing another OS alongside it and using both. Conversely, sales underestimate usage by not counting unauthorized copies. For example, in 2009, approximately 80% of software sold in China consisted of illegitimate copies.<ref>{{cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/business/global/19iht-windows.html|title= Software Pirates in China Beat Microsoft to the Punch | work= The New York Times | date=19 October 2009}}</ref> In 2007, the statistics from an automated update of IE7 for registered Windows computers differed with the observed web browser share, leading one writer to estimate that 25\u201335% of all Windows&nbsp;XP installations were unlicensed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seopher.com/articles/around_25_35_of_windows_xp_systems_are_pirated_calculations_included_|title=Around 25\u201335% of Windows XP systems are pirated (calculations included)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063513/http://www.seopher.com/articles/around_25_35_of_windows_xp_systems_are_pirated_calculations_included_|archive-date=2016-03-04}}</ref>\n\nThe usage share of Microsoft's latest client operating system{{snd}} [[Windows&nbsp;10]]{{snd}} has been slowly increasing since July/August 2016 (while [[Windows&nbsp;7]] has had a slight decrease at the same time), reaching around 27.15% in December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-weekly-201406-201641|title=StatCounter Global Stats - Browser, OS, Search Engine including Mobile Usage Share|author=|date=|work=statcounter.com|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-monthly-201511-201610|title=StatCounter Global Stats - Browser, OS, Search Engine including Mobile Usage Share|author=|date=|work=statcounter.com|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nWeb analysis shows significant variation in different parts of the world.

shipments of desktop and laptop computers. Gartner publishes estimates, but the way the estimates are calculated is not openly published. Another source of market share of various operating systems is [[StatCounter]]<ref>https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-monthly-201508-201508-bar StatCounter</ref> basing its estimate on web use (although this may not be [[Usage share of web browsers#Accuracy|very accurate]]). Also, sales may overstate usage. Most computers are sold with a [[Pre-installed software|pre-installed operating system]], with some users replacing that OS with a different one due to personal preference, or installing another OS alongside it and using both. Conversely, sales underestimate usage by not counting unauthorized copies. For example, in 2009, approximately 80% of software sold in China consisted of illegitimate copies.<ref>{{cite news| url =https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/business/global/19iht-windows.html|title= Software Pirates in China Beat Microsoft to the Punch | work= The New York Times | date=19 October 2009}}</ref> In 2007, the statistics from an automated update of IE7 for registered Windows computers differed with the observed web browser share, leading one writer to estimate that 25\u201335% of all Windows&nbsp;XP installations were unlicensed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seopher.com/articles/around_25_35_of_windows_xp_systems_are_pirated_calculations_included_|title=Around 25\u201335% of Windows XP systems are pirated (calculations included)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063513/http://www.seopher.com/articles/around_25_35_of_windows_xp_systems_are_pirated_calculations_included_|archive-date=2016-03-04}}</ref>\n\nThe usage share of Microsoft's latest client operating system{{snd}} [[Windows&nbsp;10]]{{snd}} has been slowly increasing since July/August 2016 (while [[Windows&nbsp;7]] has had a slight decrease at the same time), reaching around 27.15% in December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-weekly-201406-201641|title=StatCounter Global Stats - Browser, OS, Search Engine including Mobile Usage Share|author=|date=|work=statcounter.com|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-monthly-201511-201610|title=StatCounter Global Stats - Browser, OS, Search Engine including Mobile Usage Share|author=|date=|work=statcounter.com|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nWeb analysis shows significant variation in different parts of the world.

The band is best known for its Top 5 hit \"[[Time Won't Let Me]]\" in early 1966, which peaked at No.&nbsp;5 in the US in April, and the band also had three other Hot 100 top 40 hit singles in 1966, but none on the Hot 100 beyond then, and released a total of four albums in the mid-1960s.\n\n[[Allmusic]] described the act's style:  \"Part of the secret behind ''the Outsiders''' musical success lay in the group's embellishments [with horns and strings], which slotted in perfectly with their basic three- or four-piece instrumental sound. . . . however bold and ambitious they got, one never lost the sense of a hard, solid band sound at the core.\"<ref name=\"Eder2\">Eder, Bruce, Allmusic, [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5085/biography|pure_url=yes}} Biography of the Outsiders].

All (except Fox) performed on the original recording \"Time Won't Let Me\" by \"The Outsiders\". After that at various times a total of eight former ''Starfires'' were members of ''the Outsiders'' at one time or another performing on various studio sessions and traveling on the road.\nThe band was signed to [[Capitol Records]] on the strength of their late 1965 recording of \"Time Won't Let Me\" (written by King and his brother-in-law, Chet Kelley), leaving a local recording label headed by King's uncle, Patrick Connelly (Pama Records); at this time, the band's name was changed.  (Most of the band's original songs were written by King and Kelley, although another songwriter, Bob Turek was working with the band by 1967).  Reasons for the name change were unclear, although most sources state that it was at the insistence of their new [[record label]].<ref name=\"Eder2\"/>  One popular story about the new name was that King and Kelley had become \"outsiders\" within the family as a result of the label shift.<ref name=\"Eder\">[http://music.yahoo.com/ar-270167-bio--The-Outsiders] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> \"Time Won't Let Me\" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/209 209]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/209\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Outsiders had a built-in advantage over the numerous American bands that formed in the wake of the [[British Invasion]].  Rather than being neophytes, The Starfires had been a very active [[rhythm and blues]] band in the Cleveland scene since 1958, often playing six shows a week. King and  Kelley proved to be a formidable songwriting team, and the band was also adept at handling [[cover song|cover]]s of R&B standards.  King also headed the band's horn section and served as the arranger and sometime producer.\n\n===Touring===\nThe Outsiders promoted their hit single with about a year of nationwide touring, as \"Time Won't Let Me\" stayed on the national charts for 15 weeks (although their music was released in other countries, the band never toured overseas).  The band first toured with [[Paul Revere and the Raiders]] and then with [[Chad and Jeremy]].  Later, the Outsiders were part of a six-week tour of one-night stands headed by [[Gene Pitney]], and which included seven or eight other acts, among them [[Len Barry]], [[B.J. Thomas]] and [[Bobby Goldsboro]].  Afterwards, the Outsiders joined a four-week tour with several [[garage rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]] bands, as recalled by Geraci:\n:\"[W]e did a tour after Pitney with [[the McCoys]], ourselves and [[? and the Mysterians]], [[the Shadows of Knight]] and a group from the [[Western United States|west coast]] called [[the Seeds]]...A guy called Pete Shelton from England joined us on bass for this tour. Pete stayed with us until we could find a replacement...he then stayed on for a short while as 'Tour Manager'. There were five rock bands. Was that a crazy tour!\"<ref name=\"Krider\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epinions.com/content_43607166596|title=The Outsiders: \"Time Won't Let Me\" -  - Epinions.com|date=18 October 2001|publisher=Epinions.com|accessdate=16 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040515031119/http://www.epinions.com/content_43607166596|archivedate=15 May 2004}}</ref>\n\n===Later records===\nThere were several line-up changes over the years, with King and Madsen from the original Starfires along with vocalist [[Sonny Geraci]] forming the core of the band in the early years.  After drummer [[Ronald Harkai|Ronnie Harkai]] left the band to join the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], Denny Benson and then Ricky Biagiola (aka Ricky Baker, a stage name given to him because the managers felt Biagiola was too ethnic) handled drumming duties for a period of time. With Ronnie Harkai having departed prior to sessions for the first album, former Starfire [[Jim Fox (drummer)|Jimmy Fox]] (who had left the earlier band to go to college) was brought in by King to be the drummer for the remaining tracks of ''[[Time Won't Let Me (album)|Time Won't Let Me]]''. Following these sessions, Fox decided to return to the music world and founded a band in 1966 called [[the James Gang]] that would enjoy considerable success over the coming decade.<ref name=\"Eder2\" /> Ronnie Harkai returned to record cuts on the second album ''[[The Outsiders 2|Album No.&nbsp;2]]'', along with Ricky Biagiola. Ricky Biagiola toured with the band for almost 3 years, and was part of 4 LP's and several singles released, until returning home to Cleveland to continue his education.\n\nA short-lived but memorable [[cover song|cover]] of the [[Isley Brothers]]' \"Respectable\" from Album No.&nbsp;2 reached No.&nbsp;15 in early September 1966.  The Outsiders had performed \"Respectable\" during their earlier years as the Starfires.<ref name=\"Krider\" />\n\nA single by outside songwriters, \"Help Me Girl\" (from ''[[The Outsiders In]]''), had to compete with a version released in the same time period by [[the Animals]].  By some accounts, the Animals had already recorded their version, although they assured The Outsiders that they had not.<ref name=\"Krider\" />  The Outsiders' version peaked at No.&nbsp;37. They recorded another track by the same songwriters for their third album, but it was not released as a single.  The song, \"[[Bend Me, Shape Me]]\", became a major hit on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] in early 1968 when it was [[cover version|covered]] by [[the American Breed]] in the US and by [[Amen Corner (band)|Amen Corner]] in the UK.\n\nAfter Mert Madsen left the Outsiders to get married, two other ex-Starfires, Walter Nims and Richard D'Amato, plus Richie D'Angelo on drums joined the band.  Other session players were brought in to beef up the band's recordings, among them drummer [[Hal Blaine]] and bassist [[Carol Kaye]] of [[the Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]]; also, some recordings were produced by [[Richard Delvy]], who had worked with [[Sonny and Cher]].<ref name=\"Krider\" />  Joe Kelley (no relation to Chet Kelley), lead guitarist for [[the Shadows of Knight]], made a guest appearance on the 1967 single \"Gotta Leave Us Alone\".\n\n[[Capitol Records|Capitol]] gave tentative approval for a fourth album, which was to have been named after this single, ''Leave Us Alone''.  However, the project was abandoned midway through, in favor of a faux live album called ''[[Happening Live!]]'', where crowd noises plus song and bandmember introductions by Sonny Geraci were added to stripped-down studio renditions of older recordings, along with some recordings by the new line-up.  Not long thereafter, the group disbanded.\n\nThe Outsiders were one of the early white American soul-influenced bands.<ref name=\"Eder\"/>  In fact, the band's \"Lonely Man\" was bootlegged by a small British label and released in the UK, miscredited to [[Northern Soul]] band the Detroit Shakers and retitled \"Help Me Find My Way.\"<ref>[http://bomplist.xnet2.com/0112/msg00621.html] {{dead link|date=January 2015}}</ref> The sound they first created, combining Mersey Rock & Motown, can be felt in the later hits of [[the Buckinghams]] and [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]].  [[Jim Guercio]], who would manage both of these [[Chicago]] groups, had toured with the Outsiders as a musician on the [[Gene Pitney|Gene Pitney Caravan]].\n\n==Post-breakup==\nIn 1970, Sonny Geraci organized a new band in [[Los Angeles]] that included Walter Nims and Nick D'Amico, and released a single as \"The Outsiders featuring Sonny Geraci\" on the Bell label; commercial copies showed the \"O\" in OUTSIDERS as a [[peace symbol]].  Meanwhile, King was still heading a band called the Outsiders back in Cleveland;  and this band released a single as \"The Outsiders (featuring Jon Simonell)\"; Simonell being Geraci's replacement as lead singer.  King won a lawsuit in 1970 about the ownership of the name.<ref name =\"classic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/outsiders.html|title=The Outsiders|author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions|publisher=Classicbands.com|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>  Geraci's band name was then changed to [[Climax (band)|Climax]] ''(see article)'' and later scored a No.&nbsp;3 hit in 1972 with Nims' \"[[Precious and Few]]\".\n\nGeraci left the [[music industry]] in 1980 and spent about five years in [[sales]] in his family's [[home improvement]] business.<ref name=\"James\">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/SonnyGeraciInterview.html|title=Interview with Sonny Geraci|author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions|publisher=Classicbands.com|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>  In about 1985, he began appearing with several other mid-1960s bands as \"oldies\" acts and continued to appear in live concerts.  Along the way, he released a handful of solo CDs.  Despite the earlier lawsuit about the name, Sonny Geraci began touring in 2007 as ''Sonny Geraci and the Outsiders''.  In April 2012 Geraci suffered a brain aneurysm (specifically, a [[cerebral arteriovenous malformation]]), requiring intensive care.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagevinylnews.com/2012/05/sonny-geraci-of-climax-outsiders.html|title=Sonny Geraci of Climas & the OUtsiders Suffers Brain Aneruysm|publisher=VVN Music|date=2012-05-09|accessdate=2016-06-15}}</ref>\n\nThe most recent album by the Outsiders, called ''30 Years Live'' was released in 1996 and reissued in 2006; only two of the original members, King and Nims were on board.  The performances were taken from two live concerts in 1991 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].\n\nKing died aged 68, on April 23, 2011, in a [[Wickliffe, Ohio]] nursing home. He had suffered from multiple health problems and had been at the Wickliffe Country Place nursing home since he fell and injured himself in August. King's death was announced by Kevin King, one of his sons, and confirmed by the nursing home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/04/cleveland_rocker_tom_king_is_d.html|title=Cleveland rocker Tom King is dead at 68|work=Cleveland.com|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nGeraci died on February 5, 2017, at the age of 69.<ref name=cleveland.com>{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/02/sonny_geraci_lead_singer_of_le.html|author=Michael Norman|title=Sonny Geraci, lead singer of legendary Cleveland rock group The Outsiders, dead at 69|date=February 5, 2017|newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]|accessdate= February 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\"Time Won't Let Me\" is still prominent on [[oldies]] radio playlists, but this has created an image of the Outsiders as a \"one hit wonder\" band.  The song was also included on the [[box set]] inspired by the classic [[garage rock]] [[compilation album]] ''[[Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968]]''.  Another song, \"I'm Not Trying to Hurt You\" was included in Volume 9 of the [[Pebbles series]].  [[Bill Scheft]]'s novel about a garage rock band being rediscovered by record collectors and then attempting to recapture their glory days as the bandmembers approached the age of 50 was called ''Time Won't Let Me''.\n\n==Present Day==\nIn 2017, Ricky Biagiola, a former drummer of The Outsiders, assembled a group of veteran Cleveland musicians to return The Outsiders to playing the AM radio hits, with the energy and authenticity that made them successful then.  Determined to pay Tom King, and Sonny Geraci homage, this new version of The Outsiders continues to perform the unique music of the original group signed by Capitol Records in 1965.(Citation needed)\n\nIn early 2020, The Outsiders released their first single in 50 years.  The song, \"You & Me\", is receiving substantial airplay on internet and terrestrial radio. The song is being added to station's playlists weekly.  The song has been released on Itunes, Spotify, YouTube Music and other major digital download platforms.\n\nAlso in 2020, The Outsiders have issued a limited edition full CD called \"It's Time...\".  Limited to a run of 100 CD's, this is available through their website (www.theoutsidersusalive.com), and for sale at shows.  Featuring \"You & Me\", and new recordings of original Outsiders recordings.\n\n==Reissues==\nThe original ''Outsiders'' LPs have never been individually reissued as CDs, [[Rhino Records]] released ''Best of the Outsiders'' in 1985, while [[Collectables Records]] has also released a ''Capitol Collectors Series'' retrospective album on CD.\n\n==Band members==\n\n===The Starfires/The Outsiders 1965 (\"Time Won't Let Me\" single)===\n<ref name=\"Eder2\" /><ref name =\"classic\" />\n* Sonny Geraci, ''lead vocals''\n* John Madrid, ''trumpet''\n* Al Austin, ''lead guitar''\n* Gayle Guhde, ''keyboards''\n* Tom King, ''rhythm guitar, backing vocals, tenor saxophone''\n* Mert Madsen, ''bass, harmonica''\n* [[Ronald Harkai|Ronnie Harkai]], ''drums''\n\n===The Outsiders ===\n<ref name=\"Eder2\" /><ref name =\"classic\"/>\n* Tom King, ''rhythm guitar, tenor saxophone, vocals''\n* Sonny Geraci, ''lead vocals''\n* Mert Madsen, ''bass guitar, harmonica''\n* Bill Bruno, ''lead guitar''\n* Rick Biagiola, ''drums''\n* Jeff Silber, ''bass guitar''\n\n===The Outsiders (1967 ''Live'' album)===\n<ref name=\"Eder2\" />\n* Tom King, ''rhythm guitar, tenor saxophone, [[vocals]]''\n* Sonny Geraci, ''lead vocals''\n* Richard D'Amato, ''bass guitar''\n* Walter Nims, ''lead guitar''\n* Ricky Biagiola, ''drums''\n\n===The Outsiders (1991 ''30 Years Live'' album)===\n* Tom King, ''guitar, background vocals''\n* Walter Nims, ''guitar, background vocals''\n* Rob Mitchell, ''vocals, bass guitar''\n*Eddie Soto, ''vocals''\n* Ted Sikora, ''guitar, background vocals''\n* Dave Hershy, ''horns''\n* Joe Potnicky, ''keyboards''\n* Dan King, ''drums''\n* Rusty Schmidt, ''vocals''\n* Nick Farcas, ''keyboards''\n* Scott Ingram, ''bass guitar''\n\n<big>'''The Outsiders (2017-Present)'''</big>\n\n* Ricky Biagiola, drums, vocals\n* Rik Williger, keyboards, guitar, harmonica, vocals\n* Michael Abraham, guitar, vocals\n* Greg DePaulo, bass guitar, vocals\n* Jimmy Aschenbener, guitar, vocals\n\n\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/30-years-live-mw0000091218/credits|title=30 Years Live - The Outsiders - Credits - AllMusic|work=AllMusic|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Singles===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

All (except Fox) performed on the original recording \"Time Won't Let Me\" by \"The Outsiders\". After that at various times a total of eight former ''Starfires'' were members of ''the Outsiders'' at one time or another performing on various studio sessions and traveling on the road.\nThe band was signed to [[Capitol Records]] on the strength of their late 1965 recording of \"Time Won't Let Me\" (written by King and his brother-in-law, Chet Kelley), leaving a local recording label headed by King's uncle, Patrick Connelly (Pama Records); at this time, the band's name was changed.  (Most of the band's original songs were written by King and Kelley, although another songwriter, Bob Turek was working with the band by 1967).  Reasons for the name change were unclear, although most sources state that it was at the insistence of their new [[record label]].<ref name=\"Eder2\"/>  One popular story about the new name was that King and Kelley had become \"outsiders\" within the family as a result of the label shift.<ref name=\"Eder\">[http://music.yahoo.com/ar-270167-bio--The-Outsiders] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> \"Time Won't Let Me\" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/209 209]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/209\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Outsiders had a built-in advantage over the numerous American bands that formed in the wake of the [[British Invasion]].  Rather than being neophytes, The Starfires had been a very active [[rhythm and blues]] band in the Cleveland scene since 1958, often playing six shows a week. King and  Kelley proved to be a formidable songwriting team, and the band was also adept at handling [[cover song|cover]]s of R&B standards.  King also headed the band's horn section and served as the arranger and sometime producer.\n\n===Touring===\nThe Outsiders promoted their hit single with about a year of nationwide touring, as \"Time Won't Let Me\" stayed on the national charts for 15 weeks (although their music was released in other countries, the band never toured overseas).  The band first toured with [[Paul Revere and the Raiders]] and then with [[Chad and Jeremy]].  Later, the Outsiders were part of a six-week tour of one-night stands headed by [[Gene Pitney]], and which included seven or eight other acts, among them [[Len Barry]], [[B.J. Thomas]] and [[Bobby Goldsboro]].  Afterwards, the Outsiders joined a four-week tour with several [[garage rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]] bands, as recalled by Geraci:\n:\"[W]e did a tour after Pitney with [[the McCoys]], ourselves and [[? and the Mysterians]], [[the Shadows of Knight]] and a group from the [[Western United States|west coast]] called [[the Seeds]]...A guy called Pete Shelton from England joined us on bass for this tour. Pete stayed with us until we could find a replacement...he then stayed on for a short while as 'Tour Manager'. There were five rock bands.

After drummer [[Ronald Harkai|Ronnie Harkai]] left the band to join the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], Denny Benson and then Ricky Biagiola (aka Ricky Baker, a stage name given to him because the managers felt Biagiola was too ethnic) handled drumming duties for a period of time. With Ronnie Harkai having departed prior to sessions for the first album, former Starfire [[Jim Fox (drummer)|Jimmy Fox]] (who had left the earlier band to go to college) was brought in by King to be the drummer for the remaining tracks of ''[[Time Won't Let Me (album)|Time Won't Let Me]]''. Following these sessions, Fox decided to return to the music world and founded a band in 1966 called [[the James Gang]] that would enjoy considerable success over the coming decade.<ref name=\"Eder2\" /> Ronnie Harkai returned to record cuts on the second album ''[[The Outsiders 2|Album No.&nbsp;2]]'', along with Ricky Biagiola. Ricky Biagiola toured with the band for almost 3 years, and was part of 4 LP's and several singles released, until returning home to Cleveland to continue his education.\n\nA short-lived but memorable [[cover song|cover]] of the [[Isley Brothers]]' \"Respectable\" from Album No.&nbsp;2 reached No.&nbsp;15 in early September 1966.  The Outsiders had performed \"Respectable\" during their earlier years as the Starfires.<ref name=\"Krider\" />\n\nA single by outside songwriters, \"Help Me Girl\" (from ''[[The Outsiders In]]''), had to compete with a version released in the same time period by [[the Animals]].  By some accounts, the Animals had already recorded their version, although they assured The Outsiders that they had not.<ref name=\"Krider\" />  The Outsiders' version peaked at No.&nbsp;37. They recorded another track by the same songwriters for their third album, but it was not released as a single.  The song, \"[[Bend Me, Shape Me]]\", became a major hit on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] in early 1968 when it was [[cover version|covered]] by [[the American Breed]] in the US and by [[Amen Corner (band)|Amen Corner]] in the UK.\n\nAfter Mert Madsen left the Outsiders to get married, two other ex-Starfires, Walter Nims and Richard D'Amato, plus Richie D'Angelo on drums joined the band.  Other session players were brought in to beef up the band's recordings, among them drummer [[Hal Blaine]] and bassist [[Carol Kaye]] of [[the Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]]; also, some recordings were produced by [[Richard Delvy]], who had worked with [[Sonny and Cher]].<ref name=\"Krider\" />  Joe Kelley (no relation to Chet Kelley), lead guitarist for [[the Shadows of Knight]], made a guest appearance on the 1967 single \"Gotta Leave Us Alone\".\n\n[[Capitol Records|Capitol]] gave tentative approval for a fourth album, which was to have been named after this single, ''Leave Us Alone''.  However, the project was abandoned midway through, in favor of a faux live album called ''[[Happening Live!]]'', where crowd noises plus song and bandmember introductions by Sonny Geraci were added to stripped-down studio renditions of older recordings, along with some recordings by the new line-up.  Not long thereafter, the group disbanded.\n\nThe Outsiders were one of the early white American soul-influenced bands.<ref name=\"Eder\"/>  In fact, the band's \"Lonely Man\" was bootlegged by a small British label and released in the UK, miscredited to [[Northern Soul]] band the Detroit Shakers and retitled \"Help Me Find My Way.\"<ref>[http://bomplist.xnet2.com/0112/msg00621.html] {{dead link|date=January 2015}}</ref> The sound they first created, combining Mersey Rock & Motown, can be felt in the later hits of [[the Buckinghams]] and [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]].  [[Jim Guercio]], who would manage both of these [[Chicago]] groups, had toured with the Outsiders as a musician on the [[Gene Pitney|Gene Pitney Caravan]].\n\n==Post-breakup==\nIn 1970, Sonny Geraci organized a new band in [[Los Angeles]] that included Walter Nims and Nick D'Amico, and released a single as \"The Outsiders featuring Sonny Geraci\" on the Bell label; commercial copies showed the \"O\" in OUTSIDERS as a [[peace symbol]].  Meanwhile, King was still heading a band called the Outsiders back in Cleveland;  and this band released a single as \"The Outsiders (featuring Jon Simonell)\"; Simonell being Geraci's replacement as lead singer.  King won a lawsuit in 1970 about the ownership of the name.<ref name =\"classic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/outsiders.html|title=The Outsiders|author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions|publisher=Classicbands.com|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>  Geraci's band name was then changed to [[Climax (band)|Climax]] ''(see article)'' and later scored a No.&nbsp;3 hit in 1972 with Nims' \"[[Precious and Few]]\".\n\nGeraci left the [[music industry]] in 1980 and spent about five years in [[sales]] in his family's [[home improvement]] business.<ref name=\"James\">{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/SonnyGeraciInterview.html|title=Interview with Sonny Geraci|author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions|publisher=Classicbands.com|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>  In about 1985, he began appearing with several other mid-1960s bands as \"oldies\" acts and continued to appear in live concerts.  Along the way, he released a handful of solo CDs.  Despite the earlier lawsuit about the name, Sonny Geraci began touring in 2007 as ''Sonny Geraci and the Outsiders''.  In April 2012 Geraci suffered a brain aneurysm (specifically, a [[cerebral arteriovenous malformation]]), requiring intensive care.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagevinylnews.com/2012/05/sonny-geraci-of-climax-outsiders.html|title=Sonny Geraci of Climas & the OUtsiders Suffers Brain Aneruysm|publisher=VVN Music|date=2012-05-09|accessdate=2016-06-15}}</ref>\n\nThe most recent album by the Outsiders, called ''30 Years Live'' was released in 1996 and reissued in 2006; only two of the original members, King and Nims were on board.  The performances were taken from two live concerts in 1991 in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].\n\nKing died aged 68, on April 23, 2011, in a [[Wickliffe, Ohio]] nursing home. He had suffered from multiple health problems and had been at the Wickliffe Country Place nursing home since he fell and injured himself in August. King's death was announced by Kevin King, one of his sons, and confirmed by the nursing home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/04/cleveland_rocker_tom_king_is_d.html|title=Cleveland rocker Tom King is dead at 68|work=Cleveland.com|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nGeraci died on February 5, 2017, at the age of 69.<ref name=cleveland.com>{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/02/sonny_geraci_lead_singer_of_le.html|author=Michael Norman|title=Sonny Geraci, lead singer of legendary Cleveland rock group The Outsiders, dead at 69|date=February 5, 2017|newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]|accessdate= February 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\"Time Won't Let Me\" is still prominent on [[oldies]] radio playlists, but this has created an image of the Outsiders as a \"one hit wonder\" band.  The song was also included on the [[box set]] inspired by the classic [[garage rock]] [[compilation album]] ''[[Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968]]''.  Another song, \"I'm Not Trying to Hurt You\" was included in Volume 9 of the [[Pebbles series]].  [[Bill Scheft]]'s novel about a garage rock band being rediscovered by record collectors and then attempting to recapture their glory days as the bandmembers approached the age of 50 was called ''Time Won't Let Me''.\n\n==Present Day==\nIn 2017, Ricky Biagiola, a former drummer of The Outsiders, assembled a group of veteran Cleveland musicians to return The Outsiders to playing the AM radio hits, with the energy and authenticity that made them successful then.  Determined to pay Tom King, and Sonny Geraci homage, this new version of The Outsiders continues to perform the unique music of the original group signed by Capitol Records in 1965.(Citation needed)\n\nIn early 2020, The Outsiders released their first single in 50 years.  The song, \"You & Me\", is receiving substantial airplay on internet and terrestrial radio. The song is being added to station's playlists weekly.  The song has been released on Itunes, Spotify, YouTube Music and other major digital download platforms.\n\nAlso in 2020, The Outsiders have issued a limited edition full CD called \"It's Time...\".  Limited to a run of 100 CD's, this is available through their website (www.theoutsidersusalive.com), and for sale at shows.  Featuring \"You & Me\", and new recordings of original Outsiders recordings.\n\n==Reissues==\nThe original ''Outsiders'' LPs have never been individually reissued as CDs, [[Rhino Records]] released ''Best of the Outsiders'' in 1985, while [[Collectables Records]] has also released a ''Capitol Collectors Series'' retrospective album on CD.\n\n==Band members==\n\n===The Starfires/The Outsiders 1965 (\"Time Won't Let Me\" single)===\n<ref name=\"Eder2\" /><ref name =\"classic\" />\n* Sonny Geraci, ''lead vocals''\n* John Madrid, ''trumpet''\n* Al Austin, ''lead guitar''\n* Gayle Guhde, ''keyboards''\n* Tom King, ''rhythm guitar, backing vocals, tenor saxophone''\n* Mert Madsen, ''bass, harmonica''\n* [[Ronald Harkai|Ronnie Harkai]], ''drums''\n\n===The Outsiders ===\n<ref name=\"Eder2\" /><ref name =\"classic\"/>\n* Tom King, ''rhythm guitar, tenor saxophone, vocals''\n* Sonny Geraci, ''lead vocals''\n* Mert Madsen, ''bass guitar, harmonica''\n* Bill Bruno, ''lead guitar''\n* Rick Biagiola, ''drums''\n* Jeff Silber, ''bass guitar''\n\n===The Outsiders (1967 ''Live'' album)===\n<ref name=\"Eder2\" />\n* Tom King, ''rhythm guitar, tenor saxophone, [[vocals]]''\n* Sonny Geraci, ''lead vocals''\n* Richard D'Amato, ''bass guitar''\n* Walter Nims, ''lead guitar''\n* Ricky Biagiola, ''drums''\n\n===The Outsiders (1991 ''30 Years Live'' album)===\n* Tom King, ''guitar, background vocals''\n* Walter Nims, ''guitar, background vocals''\n* Rob Mitchell, ''vocals, bass guitar''\n*Eddie Soto, ''vocals''\n* Ted Sikora, ''guitar, background vocals''\n* Dave Hershy, ''horns''\n* Joe Potnicky, ''keyboards''\n* Dan King, ''drums''\n* Rusty Schmidt, ''vocals''\n* Nick Farcas, ''keyboards''\n* Scott Ingram, ''bass guitar''\n\n<big>'''The Outsiders (2017-Present)'''</big>\n\n* Ricky Biagiola, drums, vocals\n* Rik Williger, keyboards, guitar, harmonica, vocals\n* Michael Abraham, guitar, vocals\n* Greg DePaulo, bass guitar, vocals\n* Jimmy Aschenbener, guitar, vocals\n\n\n\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/30-years-live-mw0000091218/credits|title=30 Years Live - The Outsiders - Credits - AllMusic|work=AllMusic|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Singles===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
