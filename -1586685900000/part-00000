The decision by TV3 to drop ''Night Shift'' in 2009 was picked up by alternative music magazine [[Hot Press]] and many in the Irish music industry.\n \nAs 3e TV3 replaced most of Channel 6's homegrown programmes with repeats of Daytime TV from TV3, which it has dropped most of Channel 6 US first runs with US repeats with only ''Family Guy'', ''American Dad'' and ''The Cleveland Show'' airing first runs.\n \n3e uses the existing staff at TV3 (200 employees) to operate the channel.

Kish Media will not look to recoup their \u20ac14.5million investment until such time as the channel begins to make profits and when all liabilities at the station are paid as they fall due. It is expected that the channel will move into profit in 2010, however the downturn in the Irish market and falling advertising rates did cause the channel problems during 2009.

These included showing repeats of ''[[Xpose]]'' and ''[[Emmerdale]]'' straight after [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]], followed by putting ''Xpose'' on at 17:30 instead of 18:30 and removing repeat showings of ''Emmerdale'' and replacing them with repeat showings of ''[[Coronation Street]]''. Each of the changes failed to ignite 3e audience share, at first a small drop was seen. Xpose was returned to 18:30, while a ''Coronation Street'' omnibus was on a Sunday afternoon, however ultimately both ITV soaps were dropped from the 3e schedule.\n \n===3Kids===\nOn 27 June 2016 \u2013 3e began to broadcast as kids programming block \u2013 [[3Kids]].

Channel 6 had cancelled all but ''Day Shift'', ''Night Shift'', ''Pop Scene'' and ''Take 6'' by the time TV3 had bought the station. TV3 cancelled all of the remaining Channel 6 programmes as it re-branded the channel as 3e.\n \nWith the launch of 3e the Channel 6 programming was replaced by repeats of TV3's ''[[Xpos\u00e9]]XTRA'' and ''[[The Holiday Show]]''.

In September 2017 3e started providing 60 minute news update in the afternoons on 3e, at 13:00, 14:00, 15:00 and 16:00, this is coupled with news programming on both TV3 and be3.\n \nAlthough designed as an entertainment channel, it started broadcasting news updates shortly after its rebrand to 3e in 2009.

Channel 6 had a wider variety of content and had introduced many new US first runs to Irish TV. While their Irish content was limited to in-studio music programming (Night Shift and Day Shift), many alternative Irish bands had been given the opportunity of appearing to a wider audience. TV3's decision to drop Channel 6's home produced programming caused an outcry from many in the music industry. As 3e and Virgin Media TWO, it has relied mainly on repeats of TV3 programming, US and English programming and many reality programmes, causing the content of the channel to be diminished.\n\n==Branding==\nMarch 2006 \u2013 January 2009: Channel 6 launched its first set of identifiers (idents) in March 2006 and they remained on the channel up to its re-brand to 3e in January 2009. The presentation package was produced by Cleverality. There were several idents during this period. The 'blue dot' in the centre of the 6 would be transformed from a symbol representing entertainment into the 'blue dot'. Examples of those symbols include, the masks for drama and comedy, film reels, a television set etc.\n \nJanuary 2009\u20142015: When re-branded as 3e in January 2009, the new idents were made by Dublin-based Image Now.

It aired many new US programmes exclusively on the channel with a number of popular re-runs. The channel also re-introduced Music TV back into the Irish market, and successfully return an alternative music programme to Irish TV following the axing of No Disco ([[RT\u00c92]]) and Pop3 (TV3). The decision by TV3 to drop ''Night Shift'' in 2009 was picked up by alternative music magazine [[Hot Press]] and many in the Irish music industry.\n \nAs 3e TV3 replaced most of Channel 6's homegrown programmes with repeats of Daytime TV from TV3, which it has dropped most of Channel 6 US first runs with US repeats with only ''Family Guy'', ''American Dad'' and ''The Cleveland Show'' airing first runs.\n \n3e uses the existing staff at TV3 (200 employees) to operate the channel. The channel airs a stripped schedule with very little original programme from any country. Much of 3e's news programmes were dropped in 2015.\n \n=== Viewing figures ===\nTV3 Group reported on 12 November 2009 that 3e's viewing figures had increased since moving to Sky 105. Its audience share increased by 25% from 0.9% to 1.1% \u2013 this brought the channel back to the audience figures received by Channel 6 at the end of 2008.<ref name=\"auto11\">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/media/3e-to-launch-own-news--after-reporting-25pc-surge-in-new-sky-slot-1940290.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910053317/http://www.independent.ie/business/media/3e-to-launch-own-news--after-reporting-25pc-surge-in-new-sky-slot-1940290.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 September 2012 |work=Irish Independent |title=3e to launch own news after reporting 25pc surge in new Sky slot |date=12 November 2009 }}</ref> As of 2010, 3e has increased its viewing figures through an increase in live sports.<ref name=\"auto12\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tv3.ie/pr_sub.php?type=2&view_pr=86|title=Ratings Hit An All Time High For 3e With The Apprentice: You're Fired |work=tv3.ie}}</ref> In May 2015 3e had 2.5% of the TV viewing audience.\n \n===Budget===\n{{See also|Virgin Media One}}\n \nIn 2010, 3e's parent company recorded losses at the station during 2009. A pre-tax loss of \u20ac5million was reported to the Irish Company Registrars Office (CRO). Kish Media will not look to recoup their \u20ac14.5million investment until such time as the channel begins to make profits and when all liabilities at the station are paid as they fall due. It is expected that the channel will move into profit in 2010, however the downturn in the Irish market and falling advertising rates did cause the channel problems during 2009. Revenue was down in 2008 from 2007, while expenses during 2008 had been reduced slightly.<ref name=\"auto13\">{{cite news|last=McCaughren |first=Samantha |url=http://www.thepost.ie/news/ireland/3e-records-losses-but-profit-expected-this-year-47536.html |title=3e records losses, but profit expected this year |newspaper=The Post |date=21 February 2010 |accessdate=21 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726213400/http://www.thepost.ie/news/ireland/3e-records-losses-but-profit-expected-this-year-47536.html |archivedate=26 July 2011 }}</ref>\n \n==Programming==\nIn 2009, several rearrangements of the 3e schedule occurred. These included showing repeats of ''[[Xpose]]'' and ''[[Emmerdale]]'' straight after [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]], followed by putting ''Xpose'' on at 17:30 instead of 18:30 and removing repeat showings of ''Emmerdale'' and replacing them with repeat showings of ''[[Coronation Street]]''. Each of the changes failed to ignite 3e audience share, at first a small drop was seen. Xpose was returned to 18:30, while a ''Coronation Street'' omnibus was on a Sunday afternoon, however ultimately both ITV soaps were dropped from the 3e schedule.\n \n===3Kids===\nOn 27 June 2016 \u2013 3e began to broadcast as kids programming block \u2013 [[3Kids]]. The programming block airs seven days a week from 07:00 to 10:00, which features shows such as [[Barney & Friends]], Origanimals, [[Teletubbies]], Ghosts of Time, [[The Wiggles]], [[Stella and Sam]], and [[Winx Club]] among others.<ref name=\"auto14\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/tv-station-3e-unveil-new-8237454|title=TV station 3e unveil new children's morning block for kid-friendly shows|first=Cormac|last=O'Shea|date=20 June 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n \nFrom Monday 9 January 2017, '''3Kids''' moved to sister channel [[UTV Ireland|be3]].

Channel 6 had cancelled all but ''Day Shift'', ''Night Shift'', ''Pop Scene'' and ''Take 6'' by the time TV3 had bought the station. TV3 cancelled all of the remaining Channel 6 programmes as it re-branded the channel as 3e.\n \nWith the launch of 3e the Channel 6 programming was replaced by repeats of TV3's ''[[Xpos\u00e9]]XTRA'' and ''[[The Holiday Show]]''. Towards the end of 2009 TV3 began to produce more programming ''Xccelerate'' a weekly motoring show for 3e, produced by City Productions for TV3.<ref name=\"auto15\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.tv3.ie/pr_sub.php?type=1&view_pr=83 |title=IRELAND\u2019S ONLY MOTORING SHOW REVS UP ON 3e |publisher=TV3 |date= |accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref>\n \nIn 2010 TV3 started to repeat its morning and daytime shows to the channel as repeats.

In September 2017 3e started providing 60 minute news update in the afternoons on 3e, at 13:00, 14:00, 15:00 and 16:00, this is coupled with news programming on both TV3 and be3.\n \nAlthough designed as an entertainment channel, it started broadcasting news updates shortly after its rebrand to 3e in 2009.

Since 2011 3e has been available on Saorview. 3e was originally on Channel 6 on Saorview, TV3 later asked the BAI to instruct Saorview to move 3e to Channel 5, ahead of RT\u00c9 News Now.\n \nThe channel is available to 98% of homes within Ireland through the national [[digital terrestrial television]] service [[Saorview]].<ref name=\"auto23\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?threadid=2056092641|title=3e NOW on Saorview|work=Boards.ie}}</ref>\nIt is available to 80% of homes through digital cable and satellite service such as [[Virgin Media Ireland]], [[Magnet Networks]], [[Smart Telecom|Smartvision]] and [[Sky Ireland]].\n\n==Criticism==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nMany viewed Channel 6 as a much better service. Channel 6 had a wider variety of content and had introduced many new US first runs to Irish TV. While their Irish content was limited to in-studio music programming (Night Shift and Day Shift), many alternative Irish bands had been given the opportunity of appearing to a wider audience. TV3's decision to drop Channel 6's home produced programming caused an outcry from many in the music industry. As 3e and Virgin Media TWO, it has relied mainly on repeats of TV3 programming, US and English programming and many reality programmes, causing the content of the channel to be diminished.\n\n==Branding==\nMarch 2006 \u2013 January 2009: Channel 6 launched its first set of identifiers (idents) in March 2006 and they remained on the channel up to its re-brand to 3e in January 2009. The presentation package was produced by Cleverality. There were several idents during this period. The 'blue dot' in the centre of the 6 would be transformed from a symbol representing entertainment into the 'blue dot'. Examples of those symbols include, the masks for drama and comedy, film reels, a television set etc.\n \nJanuary 2009\u20142015: When re-branded as 3e in January 2009, the new idents were made by Dublin-based Image Now.

Its [[history]] dates back to 1895, overseeing a series of [[name]] changes as well as changes to its [[History of education in England|education]] and [[School#Components of most schools|buildings]].\n\n=== Verdin Era: 1895\u20132008 ===\nThe Verdin [[Era]] spans from 1895 to 2008 and partially to 2010 \u2013 all name changes to the school retained the term 'Verdin' from its original founders; The Verdin Family. The school was initially known to residents of [[Winsford]] as the 'Tec', but later, the term 'Verdin' had been used to refer to the school, rather than the family which founded it.<ref name=\"DavidCogger\" />\n\n==== Origins ====\nDuring the 1890s, there was a growing demand for [[Technical school|technical education]] and an attempt was made by Mr William Henry Verdin, of Darnhall Hall, [[Darnhall]] to convert Darnhall School into a Science and Technical School, but was rejected in 1893.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bostock|first1=Tony|title=Winsford: A History of a Cheshire Town and its People|year=2016|publisher=L\u00e9onie Press|isbn=978-1-901253-58-0}}</ref> However, the demand for a new type of [[education]] was there and to achieve this, money and individual initiative was all that was required. The money was provided by the activities of Mr (later Sir) Joseph Verdin, Bart, of [[Listed buildings in Northwich|The Brockhurst]], [[Northwich]].\n\n[[Sir Joseph Verdin, 1st Baronet|Sir Joseph Verdin]] and his brothers, [[Robert Verdin|Robert]] and William ran a family [[salt]] business known as Joseph Verdin & Sons (formerly Joseph and Richard Verdin), co-founded by their father, Joseph and his brother, Richard. They owned six salt plants in various locations throughout [[Cheshire]], employed over 1,000 [[people]] and produced approximately 353,000 tons of salt annually; it was the largest salt manufacturer in the [[United Kingdom]] by 1881. Having few descendants, they used their [[wealth]] to benefit the [[local community]]; they gave the Institute in [[Moulton, Cheshire|Moulton]] which \"provided facilities for the education of their workforce\", the [[Victoria Infirmary]] (presented by Robert) and Verdin Park in [[Northwich]]. In [[Winsford]], they provided the Albert Infirmary (formerly Highfield House, the home of The Verdin Family) which was presented by William and the first public swimming baths known as Verdin Baths; built to commemorate [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee]] in 1887 and was funded by Joseph and William.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kindon|first1=Frances|title=120 years in town's deep end|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/2180894.120_years_in_towns_deep_end/|accessdate=14 April 2016|work=Winsford Guardian|date=14 April 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Jobar16\">{{cite web|last1=Doane|first1=Stephen L|last2=Milnes|first2=Cynthia|last3=Farrer|first3=Stephen|last4=Farrer|first4=Barbara|last5=Verdin|first5=Graham|last6=Knight|first6=Peter|last7=Verdin|first7=John N|last8=Verdin|first8=Donald|title=Verdin Family History|url=http://jobar16.tripod.com/|website=Jobar16 \u2013 Tripod|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Victoria Infirmary, Northwich|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/hospitalrecords/details.asp?id=1641|website=The National Archives|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Down Your Way|url=http://www.independentnewspapers.co.uk/midcheshire/viewstory/5031/advertising.php|accessdate=2 December 2016|work=Mid-Cheshire Independent|publisher=Paul Hurley|date=23 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1880s, salt production was thriving, but due to the increased pumping of [[brine]] from beneath the ground led to huge problems of [[subsidence]], particularly in [[Winsford]] and [[Northwich]]. Fields sank, roads cracked and houses slipped leading to costly repairs. People whose property was affected sought compensation, but the difficulty arose in identifying who was to blame, as pumping can affect an area several miles away.\n\nIn 1889, The Verdin Trust was established by Sir Joseph Verdin to compensate people for [[subsidence]] caused by [[brine]] pumping. However, in 1891 the Brine Pumping (Compensation for Subsidence) Act was introduced to provide compensation for owners of property, thereby rendering the Trust redundant. As a result, Sir Joseph Verdin decided to use the money in other ways which includes the construction and development of the Verdin Technical Schools in [[Winsford]] and [[Northwich]] \u2013 the one in Winsford which is known as Verdin Technical School was a prototype for a second and larger one in Northwich, that eventually opened in 1897 as Verdin Technical Schools & Gymnasium (latterly in use as Cheshire School of Art and Design, which closed in 2012).<ref name=\"PaulHurley\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Former Verdin Technical Schools & Gymnasium, Northwich|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1417201|website=Historic England|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe location for the Verdin Technical School in Winsford was determined when a site was bought adjacent to the Over Board School near the [[Junction (road)|junction]] of High Street and Grange Lane. The design of the building was identified via a 'best design' [[competition]] that was won by Messrs Woodhouse and Willoughby, [[Architect]]s, of [[Manchester]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pevsner|first1=Nikolaus|authorlink1=Nikolaus Pevsner|last2=Hubbard|first2=Edward|authorlink2=Edward Hubbard|title=Cheshire (The Buildings of England)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kl99LwM8BYgC&pg=PA390|accessdate=9 November 2016|year=1971|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09588-3|page=390}}</ref> The construction was left to Messrs James Fowles and Sons, of Winsford and the building began with the foundation stone being laid down on 4 August 1894 by Mr William Henry Verdin, Joseph's brother. As the [[land]] was well-drained into a [[gully]], now covered over and eventually found its way into the [[River Weaver]]. This allowed the construction of a [[basement]] and [[workshop]]s to be built at ground level in the steep fall at the rear, isolating it from the general teaching rooms. On 8 August 1895, the building was officially opened by the [[Duke of Westminster|Duke and Duchess of Westminster]]. The [[Cornerstone|foundation stone]] and an [[Epigraphy|inscription]] marking the [[opening ceremony]] can still be seen at the front of the building.<ref name=\"DavidCogger\" />\n\n==== Verdin Technical School: 1895\u20131906 ====\nThe Verdin Technical School opened on 9 September 1895 enrolling 43 students on the first day.

The outcome of the review resulted in the decision to Federate Verdin High School and Woodford Lodge High School that was officially completed in January 2008, under the name ''''Winsford High School Federation''''. The Federation was led and managed by a [[Head teacher|Principal]] and a single [[School governor|Governing Body]] of 21 Governors. Both schools had a site headteacher and senior managers were appointed to the Federation, however, most aspects of provision were managed on one site.\n\nThe Federation was established in preparation for another proposal, the establishment of an all-through school in [[Winsford]] by 2012. The proposal would bring together [[Primary education#United Kingdom|primary]], [[Secondary education#United Kingdom|secondary]] and [[Special education in the United Kingdom|special]] provision in Winsford as one educational establishment with hopes it would be supported by Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme. However, due to central government uncertainties, there has been a delay in the entry of 19 local authorities into the programme, including [[Cheshire West and Chester Council]]. As a result, [[funding]] has not been available for the all-through proposal.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wm Stephens|first1=John|title=Proposal for the closure of the Verdin High School and Woodford Lodge High School Winsford and the establishment of an Academy|journal=Cheshire West and Chester Council|date=March 2010|issue=Public Consultation|pages=4\u20135|url=http://www.cheshirewestandchester.gov.uk/news_and_events/idoc.ashx?docid=ad2508b4-e1a8-4d18-bdae-5643a7e8fd35&version=-1|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 April 2008, it was announced that Mr Martin Howlett was appointed as [[Head teacher|Principal]] of the Winsford High School Federation, and the two site headteachers appointed were Mr Paul Harrington for Verdin High School and Mr John Foreman for Woodford Lodge High School.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Albert|first1=Simon|title=Former Verdin High School head is new man at the top|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/2198442.former_verdin_high_school_head_is_new_man_at_the_top/|accessdate=14 April 2016|work=Winsford Guardian|date=19 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nBoth Verdin High School and Woodford Lodge High School retained their names under the Winsford High School Federation when it was established in January 2008, and its uniforms remained the same. However, under the Federation, Verdin High School was known as 'Verdin Site' and Woodford Lodge High School was known as 'Woodford Site'. The Federation had its own logo as well as two identical logos with the site names underneath to represent both schools. The former websites for both schools (<code>www.verdin.cheshire.sch.uk</code> and <code>www.woodford.cheshire.sch.uk</code>) became [[virtual learning environment]]s (VLEs), with a new Federation website (<code>www.wsf.cheshire.sch.uk</code>) that represented and provided information for both schools respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Winsford High School Federation|url=http://www.wsf.cheshire.sch.uk/|website=Winsford High School Federation|accessdate=25 January 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915094400/http://www.wsf.cheshire.sch.uk/|archivedate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 March 2010, it was announced that the two Federated schools would close to make way for an [[Academy (English school)|Academy]] by as early as September 2010. There would also be a new \u00a320 million school building that will accommodate 1,700 students (1,500 for 11\u201316 and 200 for post-16) and is expected to be built on a site behind the Verdin Exchange. The site was once earmarked for former Local Authority, [[Cheshire County Council]]'s original plan of a \u00a373 million all-through school, which was ruled out due to a lack of available central funding. The proposed Academy would initially run from the two existing school sites and [[Cheshire West and Chester Council]] are still hoping that \"the Academy could still be the first stage of an eventual 'all-through education concept', which will include special schools and special needs pupils\". A six-week public consultation programme on the proposed closure and commence this month.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kindon|first1=Frances|title=Verdin High School and Woodford Lodge High School to close to make way for academy|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/5037949.Winsford_s_high_schools_to_close_to_make_way_for_academy/|accessdate=14 April 2016|work=Winsford Guardian|date=3 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== Proposed academy ====\nOn 10 March 2010, the Local Authority, [[Cheshire West and Chester Council]] issued a document as the first part of the formal public consultation process and aims to provide as much information as possible on the proposal to close the two Federated schools on 31 August 2010, and replace them with one Academy on 1 September 2010 to serve the [[Winsford]] area. It also seeks to gather views from [[student]]s, [[parent]]s, [[Employment#Employees and employers|staff]], [[School governor|governors]], the [[local community]] and other key [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] who are interested in the proposal. The public consultation is designed to make sure that all those involved can see and understand why the proposal is being put forward and have the opportunity to comment on and/or object to the proposal. The consultation will last 6 weeks through March/April 2010, allowing the council to gather as much feedback as possible. During this period, the sponsors will run a separate consultation on the proposed Academy.\n\nA key highlight in the proposal shows a decline in student numbers with over 600 empty places at the two Federated schools when combined, and there would be no additional funding to support the other options which have been considered. However, the Academy programme \"provides significant capital investment for either a new building or adaptation and refurbishment\". The council is supporting the proposal and have identified a sponsor who would have the appropriate skills and resources to support the Academy in the longer term. The sponsor will be responsible for running the Academy, should the proposal be approved and [[E-ACT]] are interested in being the sponsor, having also confirmed it would adopt the Local Authority's admission arrangements, meaning anyone could apply for a place.\n\nThe proposed Academy would have 1,700 places (1,500 for 11\u201316 and 200 post-16) and students at the two closing Federated schools would automatically transfer to the new Academy from 1 September 2010, should they wish to do so. The Academy would open utilising the two existing school sites and the Local Authority will work with the sponsor to ensure smooth transition. Pupils that are due to transfer in [[Year Seven|Year 7]] to Verdin or Woodford in September 2010 would be offered a place at the new Academy. If the proposed Academy does not go ahead, the two Federated schools would continue under its Winsford High School Federation and \"other proposals would have to be developed to deal with the need to improve performance\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wm Stephens|first1=John|title=Proposal for the closure of the Verdin High School and Woodford Lodge High School Winsford and the establishment of an Academy|journal=Cheshire West and Chester Council|date=March 2010|issue=Public Consultation|pages=3, 5\u20137|url=http://www.cheshirewestandchester.gov.uk/news_and_events/idoc.ashx?docid=ad2508b4-e1a8-4d18-bdae-5643a7e8fd35&version=-1|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 April 2010, it was announced that the six-week public consultation is due to end today. However, concerns were raised by parents who attended a meeting held by [[Winsford Town Council]] on 19 April 2010, that 'inadequate' information was provided by [[Cheshire West and Chester Council]]. For example, Lynne Miller, who attended with her daughter \u2013 a student at Woodford Lodge, said: \"We have not been provided with the information as promised. Everyone has a view but without the information how on earth can we respond?\" The town council supports parents' concerns and are wanting the consultation period to be extended to December. Should the consultation not be extended, a decision will be made in a weeks' time on the proposed Academy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Durose|first1=Katie|title=Schools set for academy|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/8110978.Schools_set_for_academy/|accessdate=1 November 2016|work=Winsford Guardian|date=21 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 April 2010, it was announced that the six-week public consultation had come to an end, which was extended by five days. A meeting will be held today by the [[Cheshire West and Chester Council]] Executive Committee in Ellesmere Port where the fate will be decided in a vote open to [[parent]]s and the [[public]]. Following on from the previous concerns on the two Federated schools mentioned in the first part of the formal public consultation in March 2010, the council also reported an 'alarming drop' in applications within the town ([[Winsford]]) of its two Federated schools, losing approximately a third of its secondary schools' pupils to [[Northwich]] and [[Middlewich]]. The Sixth Form numbers have also dropped, resulting in the two Federated school's decision to not offer [[Year Twelve|Year 12]] study from September this year, regardless of whether the proposed Academy goes ahead or not. Should the vote result in the 'go ahead', a six-week period will follow to allow further representations from parents and other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] before a final decision is made.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Durose|first1=Katie|title=Town set for academy|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/8122720.Town_set_for_academy/|accessdate=18 October 2016|work=Winsford Guardian|date=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 May 2010, it was announced that [[Cheshire West and Chester Council]] Executive Committee had voted in the 'go ahead', deciding on a 'statutory notice' for the closure of the two Federated schools.

Representatives from the sponsor were there to provide information on the proposed Academy and addressed concerns to those affected by the proposal. For example, \"parents and councillors have criticised the way the plans have been carried out after E-ACT was prevented from providing information by regulations governing publicity about anything considered political during the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|General Election]]\".

It will provide members of the local community the opportunity to learn more about the project and its development as well as the [[construction]] industry.<ref>{{cite news|title=Winsford Academy opens its doors|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/9987311.Winsford_Academy_opens_its_doors/|accessdate=12 December 2017|work=Winsford Guardian|date=18 October 2012|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 November 2012, it was announced that Eddisbury MP, [[Stephen O'Brien]] was among the dignitaries and members of the local community who were invited to tour the site on 9 November 2012. He said: \"I was really impressed to see the progress which has been made \u2026 The concern shown by the contractors to minimise the impact and disruption to the local neighbourhood and the fact that it was designed with the benefit of the children's' learning experience to the fore is a massive step forward for Winsford. The Academy has my complete support.\" Kier Construction announced they are due to complete the new build in July 2013. The new build sees [[E-ACT]]'s intake increase from 1,045 to 1,700 and has already started to reverse the historical trend of Winsford losing secondary pupils to neighbouring towns, with the estimated 2013 intake for [[Year Seven|Year 7's]] up 50% compared to 2011. Following on from the designs of the new build mentioned previously, the [[classroom]]s on the second and third floors at the rear of the building are set back from a [[balcony]] overlooking 'The Street', offering students areas to socialise and study. There will also be a new [[library]], [[Shed#Specific-use|bike sheds]] and [[locker]]s. The theatre will be able to seat 425 people which will allow for larger scale productions. The school field will be redesigned to encompass sports pitches and [[Multi-Use Games Area]]s.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Matthew|title=E-ACT school build attracts bumper intake|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/10043993.E_ACT_school_build_attracts_bumper_intake/|accessdate=12 December 2017|work=Winsford Guardian|date=14 November 2012|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===== Closure of former Verdin building =====\nOn 16 July 2013, it was announced that around 60 Academy [[dance]] students from [[Year Nine|Year 9]] and [[Year Ten|10]], performed a [[Choreography (dance)|choreographed]] [[flash mob]] at the front of the former Verdin High School building to mark the end of an [[era]], and to celebrate their move into the new building in September. Laura Wilkinson, Head of Dance discusses the Academy's excitement of the new build and said: \"We've got a brand new dance studio with sprung floors and a new theatre. It's really going to let us do lots more productions. Dance is one of our most popular subjects at the moment. It's really developed over the last five years.

Mr Andrew Taylor-Edwards, Principal told the [[Chester Chronicle]] that \"while the proportion of students opting to stay on for Sixth Form study has remained constant, recent cuts to funding have put 'increasing pressure on the financial viability of providing our small post-16 provision'\". He also said that \"we have always prided ourselves in our ability to offer a small Sixth Form provision, allowing students an intimate setting where every student is known and where class sizes are small\". The Academy will not be offering Year 12 study to current Year 11 students from September this year, while remaining fully committed to current Year 12 Sixth Form students who will start their second year of study.<ref>{{cite news|title=Winsford Academy to suspend sixth form provision from September 2016|url=http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/news/chester-cheshire-news/winsford-academy-suspend-sixth-form-8442338|accessdate=7 October 2016|work=Chester Chronicle|date=14 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===== Potential re-establishment =====\nOn 11 May 2015, Mr Peter Rubery, Executive Principal of The Fallibroome Multi-Academy Trust (Academy sponsor), announced that the Sixth Form provision will be re-established at the 'earliest opportunity' and that it is the desire of the Trust to create an 'innovative post 16 provision'. He also discussed concerns over the Academy's previous sponsor and said that it \"made some poor decisions that resulted in overstaffing and budgetary difficulties. These have been addressed and the school will start the new academic year in a stable position, with resources to invest in creating exciting learning opportunities for students and staff\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Winsford Academy sixth form to be re-opened at 'earliest opportunity'|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/12939051.Winsford_Academy_sixth_form_to_be_re_opened_at____earliest_opportunity_/|accessdate=7 October 2016|work=Winsford Guardian|date=11 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 January 2016, Mr Peter Rubery announced that a feasibility study will be undertaken with regard to the potential re-establishment of Sixth Form provision, and will involve consultation with students and parents as well as comparing the Academy's potential offer with the surrounding providers. The Academy are considering a range of qualifications, academic and vocational as well as work-related learning. The feasibility study is designed to fully assess the viability of a new Sixth Form at The Winsford Academy. A further update will be provided later in the summer term, once a new Principal has been appointed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Important Update \u2013 Sixth Form Planning|url=http://winsford.academy/important-update-sixth-form-planning/|accessdate=8 October 2016|work=The Winsford Academy|date=28 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 July 2016, it was announced that a feasibility study has been carried out and the Academy Governors and Sponsor have launched a consultation on the future of the Sixth Form, announcing intentions to re-establish provision in 2019. Mr Peter Rubery said: \"When the Trust was invited to sponsor the Academy in 2014 it was clear to all parties that the Sixth Form was unsustainable. Students in Vale Royal have attractive choices in [[Sir John Deane's College]] and [[Mid Cheshire College]] and it's no surprise that all other schools, bar the catholic sector, do not have Sixth Forms. It was pleasing to note that Ofsted supported our decision to suspend the Sixth Form in 2014 and focus our attention on raising standards in the main school. That objective was achieved and is reflected in a terrific report. Inspectors noted the academic support given to the current Year 13 but agreed that wider provision for personal development for sixth formers was not possible with such low numbers\".\n\nThe last Year 13 students have now left and the Academy Governors are consulting on a formal proposal to close the Sixth Form, and are already planning on what needs to be done to re-establish Sixth Form provision. The feasibility study report points out that according to [[Department for Education]] guidelines, the Academy would need to reapply to open a Sixth Form and would need to meet the criteria for an application. This will involve the Academy proving it can recruit 200 students from the area and sustain the number, offer at least 20 academic A Level subjects and remain financially viable. The report also outlines the financial costs of re-establishing Sixth Form provision totalling around \u00a3300,000, which includes approximately \u00a3250,000 towards staffing costs.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pennington|first1=Josh|title=Winsford Academy aiming to reopen sixth form in 2019|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/14639897.Winsford_Academy_aiming_to_reopen_sixth_form_in_2019/|accessdate=12 October 2016|work=Winsford Guardian|date=25 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Motto ==\nThe Winsford Academy's [[motto]] is \"Succeed, Aspire, Learn Together\" and its acronym makes the word 'SALT', which is based upon the towns mining heritage and The Verdin Family who founded the Verdin Technical School in 1895 that developed into the present Academy.

Its [[history]] dates back to 1895, overseeing a series of [[name]] changes as well as changes to its [[History of education in England|education]] and [[School#Components of most schools|buildings]].\n\n=== Verdin Era: 1895\u20132008 ===\nThe Verdin [[Era]] spans from 1895 to 2008 and partially to 2010 \u2013 all name changes to the school retained the term 'Verdin' from its original founders; The Verdin Family. The school was initially known to residents of [[Winsford]] as the 'Tec', but later, the term 'Verdin' had been used to refer to the school, rather than the family which founded it.<ref name=\"DavidCogger\" />\n\n==== Origins ====\nDuring the 1890s, there was a growing demand for [[Technical school|technical education]] and an attempt was made by Mr William Henry Verdin, of Darnhall Hall, [[Darnhall]] to convert Darnhall School into a Science and Technical School, but was rejected in 1893.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bostock|first1=Tony|title=Winsford: A History of a Cheshire Town and its People|year=2016|publisher=L\u00e9onie Press|isbn=978-1-901253-58-0}}</ref> However, the demand for a new type of [[education]] was there and to achieve this, money and individual initiative was all that was required. The money was provided by the activities of Mr (later Sir) Joseph Verdin, Bart, of [[Listed buildings in Northwich|The Brockhurst]], [[Northwich]].\n\n[[Sir Joseph Verdin, 1st Baronet|Sir Joseph Verdin]] and his brothers, [[Robert Verdin|Robert]] and William ran a family [[salt]] business known as Joseph Verdin & Sons (formerly Joseph and Richard Verdin), co-founded by their father, Joseph and his brother, Richard. They owned six salt plants in various locations throughout [[Cheshire]], employed over 1,000 [[people]] and produced approximately 353,000 tons of salt annually; it was the largest salt manufacturer in the [[United Kingdom]] by 1881. Having few descendants, they used their [[wealth]] to benefit the [[local community]]; they gave the Institute in [[Moulton, Cheshire|Moulton]] which \"provided facilities for the education of their workforce\", the [[Victoria Infirmary]] (presented by Robert) and Verdin Park in [[Northwich]]. In [[Winsford]], they provided the Albert Infirmary (formerly Highfield House, the home of The Verdin Family) which was presented by William and the first public swimming baths known as Verdin Baths; built to commemorate [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee]] in 1887 and was funded by Joseph and William.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kindon|first1=Frances|title=120 years in town's deep end|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/2180894.120_years_in_towns_deep_end/|accessdate=14 April 2016|work=Winsford Guardian|date=14 April 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Jobar16\">{{cite web|last1=Doane|first1=Stephen L|last2=Milnes|first2=Cynthia|last3=Farrer|first3=Stephen|last4=Farrer|first4=Barbara|last5=Verdin|first5=Graham|last6=Knight|first6=Peter|last7=Verdin|first7=John N|last8=Verdin|first8=Donald|title=Verdin Family History|url=http://jobar16.tripod.com/|website=Jobar16 \u2013 Tripod|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Victoria Infirmary, Northwich|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/hospitalrecords/details.asp?id=1641|website=The National Archives|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Down Your Way|url=http://www.independentnewspapers.co.uk/midcheshire/viewstory/5031/advertising.php|accessdate=2 December 2016|work=Mid-Cheshire Independent|publisher=Paul Hurley|date=23 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1880s, salt production was thriving, but due to the increased pumping of [[brine]] from beneath the ground led to huge problems of [[subsidence]], particularly in [[Winsford]] and [[Northwich]]. Fields sank, roads cracked and houses slipped leading to costly repairs. People whose property was affected sought compensation, but the difficulty arose in identifying who was to blame, as pumping can affect an area several miles away.\n\nIn 1889, The Verdin Trust was established by Sir Joseph Verdin to compensate people for [[subsidence]] caused by [[brine]] pumping. However, in 1891 the Brine Pumping (Compensation for Subsidence) Act was introduced to provide compensation for owners of property, thereby rendering the Trust redundant. As a result, Sir Joseph Verdin decided to use the money in other ways which includes the construction and development of the Verdin Technical Schools in [[Winsford]] and [[Northwich]] \u2013 the one in Winsford which is known as Verdin Technical School was a prototype for a second and larger one in Northwich, that eventually opened in 1897 as Verdin Technical Schools & Gymnasium (latterly in use as Cheshire School of Art and Design, which closed in 2012).<ref name=\"PaulHurley\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Former Verdin Technical Schools & Gymnasium, Northwich|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1417201|website=Historic England|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe location for the Verdin Technical School in Winsford was determined when a site was bought adjacent to the Over Board School near the [[Junction (road)|junction]] of High Street and Grange Lane. The design of the building was identified via a 'best design' [[competition]] that was won by Messrs Woodhouse and Willoughby, [[Architect]]s, of [[Manchester]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pevsner|first1=Nikolaus|authorlink1=Nikolaus Pevsner|last2=Hubbard|first2=Edward|authorlink2=Edward Hubbard|title=Cheshire (The Buildings of England)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kl99LwM8BYgC&pg=PA390|accessdate=9 November 2016|year=1971|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09588-3|page=390}}</ref> The construction was left to Messrs James Fowles and Sons, of Winsford and the building began with the foundation stone being laid down on 4 August 1894 by Mr William Henry Verdin, Joseph's brother. As the [[land]] was well-drained into a [[gully]], now covered over and eventually found its way into the [[River Weaver]]. This allowed the construction of a [[basement]] and [[workshop]]s to be built at ground level in the steep fall at the rear, isolating it from the general teaching rooms. On 8 August 1895, the building was officially opened by the [[Duke of Westminster|Duke and Duchess of Westminster]]. The [[Cornerstone|foundation stone]] and an [[Epigraphy|inscription]] marking the [[opening ceremony]] can still be seen at the front of the building.<ref name=\"DavidCogger\" />\n\n==== Verdin Technical School: 1895\u20131906 ====\nThe Verdin Technical School opened on 9 September 1895 enrolling 43 students on the first day.

The outcome of the review resulted in the decision to Federate Verdin High School and Woodford Lodge High School that was officially completed in January 2008, under the name ''''Winsford High School Federation''''. The Federation was led and managed by a [[Head teacher|Principal]] and a single [[School governor|Governing Body]] of 21 Governors. Both schools had a site headteacher and senior managers were appointed to the Federation, however, most aspects of provision were managed on one site.\n\nThe Federation was established in preparation for another proposal, the establishment of an all-through school in [[Winsford]] by 2012. The proposal would bring together [[Primary education#United Kingdom|primary]], [[Secondary education#United Kingdom|secondary]] and [[Special education in the United Kingdom|special]] provision in Winsford as one educational establishment with hopes it would be supported by Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme. However, due to central government uncertainties, there has been a delay in the entry of 19 local authorities into the programme, including [[Cheshire West and Chester Council]]. As a result, [[funding]] has not been available for the all-through proposal.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wm Stephens|first1=John|title=Proposal for the closure of the Verdin High School and Woodford Lodge High School Winsford and the establishment of an Academy|journal=Cheshire West and Chester Council|date=March 2010|issue=Public Consultation|pages=4\u20135|url=http://www.cheshirewestandchester.gov.uk/news_and_events/idoc.ashx?docid=ad2508b4-e1a8-4d18-bdae-5643a7e8fd35&version=-1|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 April 2008, it was announced that Mr Martin Howlett was appointed as [[Head teacher|Principal]] of the Winsford High School Federation, and the two site headteachers appointed were Mr Paul Harrington for Verdin High School and Mr John Foreman for Woodford Lodge High School.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Albert|first1=Simon|title=Former Verdin High School head is new man at the top|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/2198442.former_verdin_high_school_head_is_new_man_at_the_top/|accessdate=14 April 2016|work=Winsford Guardian|date=19 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nBoth Verdin High School and Woodford Lodge High School retained their names under the Winsford High School Federation when it was established in January 2008, and its uniforms remained the same. However, under the Federation, Verdin High School was known as 'Verdin Site' and Woodford Lodge High School was known as 'Woodford Site'. The Federation had its own logo as well as two identical logos with the site names underneath to represent both schools. The former websites for both schools (<code>www.verdin.cheshire.sch.uk</code> and <code>www.woodford.cheshire.sch.uk</code>) became [[virtual learning environment]]s (VLEs), with a new Federation website (<code>www.wsf.cheshire.sch.uk</code>) that represented and provided information for both schools respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Winsford High School Federation|url=http://www.wsf.cheshire.sch.uk/|website=Winsford High School Federation|accessdate=25 January 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915094400/http://www.wsf.cheshire.sch.uk/|archivedate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 March 2010, it was announced that the two Federated schools would close to make way for an [[Academy (English school)|Academy]] by as early as September 2010. There would also be a new \u00a320 million school building that will accommodate 1,700 students (1,500 for 11\u201316 and 200 for post-16) and is expected to be built on a site behind the Verdin Exchange. The site was once earmarked for former Local Authority, [[Cheshire County Council]]'s original plan of a \u00a373 million all-through school, which was ruled out due to a lack of available central funding. The proposed Academy would initially run from the two existing school sites and [[Cheshire West and Chester Council]] are still hoping that \"the Academy could still be the first stage of an eventual 'all-through education concept', which will include special schools and special needs pupils\". A six-week public consultation programme on the proposed closure and commence this month.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kindon|first1=Frances|title=Verdin High School and Woodford Lodge High School to close to make way for academy|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/5037949.Winsford_s_high_schools_to_close_to_make_way_for_academy/|accessdate=14 April 2016|work=Winsford Guardian|date=3 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== Proposed academy ====\nOn 10 March 2010, the Local Authority, [[Cheshire West and Chester Council]] issued a document as the first part of the formal public consultation process and aims to provide as much information as possible on the proposal to close the two Federated schools on 31 August 2010, and replace them with one Academy on 1 September 2010 to serve the [[Winsford]] area. It also seeks to gather views from [[student]]s, [[parent]]s, [[Employment#Employees and employers|staff]], [[School governor|governors]], the [[local community]] and other key [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] who are interested in the proposal. The public consultation is designed to make sure that all those involved can see and understand why the proposal is being put forward and have the opportunity to comment on and/or object to the proposal. The consultation will last 6 weeks through March/April 2010, allowing the council to gather as much feedback as possible. During this period, the sponsors will run a separate consultation on the proposed Academy.\n\nA key highlight in the proposal shows a decline in student numbers with over 600 empty places at the two Federated schools when combined, and there would be no additional funding to support the other options which have been considered. However, the Academy programme \"provides significant capital investment for either a new building or adaptation and refurbishment\". The council is supporting the proposal and have identified a sponsor who would have the appropriate skills and resources to support the Academy in the longer term. The sponsor will be responsible for running the Academy, should the proposal be approved and [[E-ACT]] are interested in being the sponsor, having also confirmed it would adopt the Local Authority's admission arrangements, meaning anyone could apply for a place.\n\nThe proposed Academy would have 1,700 places (1,500 for 11\u201316 and 200 post-16) and students at the two closing Federated schools would automatically transfer to the new Academy from 1 September 2010, should they wish to do so. The Academy would open utilising the two existing school sites and the Local Authority will work with the sponsor to ensure smooth transition. Pupils that are due to transfer in [[Year Seven|Year 7]] to Verdin or Woodford in September 2010 would be offered a place at the new Academy. If the proposed Academy does not go ahead, the two Federated schools would continue under its Winsford High School Federation and \"other proposals would have to be developed to deal with the need to improve performance\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wm Stephens|first1=John|title=Proposal for the closure of the Verdin High School and Woodford Lodge High School Winsford and the establishment of an Academy|journal=Cheshire West and Chester Council|date=March 2010|issue=Public Consultation|pages=3, 5\u20137|url=http://www.cheshirewestandchester.gov.uk/news_and_events/idoc.ashx?docid=ad2508b4-e1a8-4d18-bdae-5643a7e8fd35&version=-1|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 April 2010, it was announced that the six-week public consultation is due to end today. However, concerns were raised by parents who attended a meeting held by [[Winsford Town Council]] on 19 April 2010, that 'inadequate' information was provided by [[Cheshire West and Chester Council]]. For example, Lynne Miller, who attended with her daughter \u2013 a student at Woodford Lodge, said: \"We have not been provided with the information as promised. Everyone has a view but without the information how on earth can we respond?\" The town council supports parents' concerns and are wanting the consultation period to be extended to December. Should the consultation not be extended, a decision will be made in a weeks' time on the proposed Academy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Durose|first1=Katie|title=Schools set for academy|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/8110978.Schools_set_for_academy/|accessdate=1 November 2016|work=Winsford Guardian|date=21 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 April 2010, it was announced that the six-week public consultation had come to an end, which was extended by five days. A meeting will be held today by the [[Cheshire West and Chester Council]] Executive Committee in Ellesmere Port where the fate will be decided in a vote open to [[parent]]s and the [[public]]. Following on from the previous concerns on the two Federated schools mentioned in the first part of the formal public consultation in March 2010, the council also reported an 'alarming drop' in applications within the town ([[Winsford]]) of its two Federated schools, losing approximately a third of its secondary schools' pupils to [[Northwich]] and [[Middlewich]]. The Sixth Form numbers have also dropped, resulting in the two Federated school's decision to not offer [[Year Twelve|Year 12]] study from September this year, regardless of whether the proposed Academy goes ahead or not. Should the vote result in the 'go ahead', a six-week period will follow to allow further representations from parents and other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] before a final decision is made.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Durose|first1=Katie|title=Town set for academy|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/8122720.Town_set_for_academy/|accessdate=18 October 2016|work=Winsford Guardian|date=28 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 May 2010, it was announced that [[Cheshire West and Chester Council]] Executive Committee had voted in the 'go ahead', deciding on a 'statutory notice' for the closure of the two Federated schools.

Representatives from the sponsor were there to provide information on the proposed Academy and addressed concerns to those affected by the proposal. For example, \"parents and councillors have criticised the way the plans have been carried out after E-ACT was prevented from providing information by regulations governing publicity about anything considered political during the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|General Election]]\". Mr Martin Howlett, Principal of Winsford High School Federation said: \"there were obviously concerns that were put forward in the public airing but afterwards there was a general feeling of positivity. It's important to remember that we remember people don't always like change\". A second consultation evening will be held by E-ACT for parents of pupils at Verdin High School on 7 June 2010.

The new build which is a Government-funded project and a partnership between the Academy, Cheshire West and Chester Council and sponsors E-ACT, is set to open in September 2013.<ref name=\"NewBuildFacebook\" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Matthew|title=Work begins on new E-Act academy|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/9820509.Work_begins_on_new_E_Act_academy/|accessdate=12 December 2017|work=Winsford Guardian|date=17 July 2012|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=Bolt turning celebrates construction milestone at Winsford E-ACT Academy|url=http://www.kier.co.uk/press-office/press-release/2012/19-07-2012a.aspx|publisher=[[Kier Group]]|date=2012-07-19|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Winsford Academy New Build - Under Construction Aerial View (11 September 2012).png|thumb|right|[[Bird's-eye view|Aerial view]] of the new build under construction as of 11 September 2012, and former Verdin building in use; set to be [[Demolition|demolished]] following completion.]] -->\nOn 18 October 2012, it was announced that the Academy will open its doors of the new build which is still under construction, as part of the 'Open Doors' scheme; a pilot project from the construction industry that \"invites members of the public from all across the UK to visit and tour a construction site in their area\". It was formed as a partnership between four industry bodies; [[UK Contractors Group]] (UKCG), [[CITB-ConstructionSkills]], Considerate Constructors Scheme and the [[Chartered Institute of Building]] (CIOB). It consists of over 23 participating employers; [[Kier Group|Kier]] who is the Academy's new build contractor being one and will offer tours around the site on 9 and 10 November 2012 from 9am to 4pm and 9am to 1pm respectively. It will provide members of the local community the opportunity to learn more about the project and its development as well as the [[construction]] industry.<ref>{{cite news|title=Winsford Academy opens its doors|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/9987311.Winsford_Academy_opens_its_doors/|accessdate=12 December 2017|work=Winsford Guardian|date=18 October 2012|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 November 2012, it was announced that Eddisbury MP, [[Stephen O'Brien]] was among the dignitaries and members of the local community who were invited to tour the site on 9 November 2012. He said: \"I was really impressed to see the progress which has been made \u2026 The concern shown by the contractors to minimise the impact and disruption to the local neighbourhood and the fact that it was designed with the benefit of the children's' learning experience to the fore is a massive step forward for Winsford. The Academy has my complete support.\" Kier Construction announced they are due to complete the new build in July 2013. The new build sees [[E-ACT]]'s intake increase from 1,045 to 1,700 and has already started to reverse the historical trend of Winsford losing secondary pupils to neighbouring towns, with the estimated 2013 intake for [[Year Seven|Year 7's]] up 50% compared to 2011. Following on from the designs of the new build mentioned previously, the [[classroom]]s on the second and third floors at the rear of the building are set back from a [[balcony]] overlooking 'The Street', offering students areas to socialise and study. There will also be a new [[library]], [[Shed#Specific-use|bike sheds]] and [[locker]]s. The theatre will be able to seat 425 people which will allow for larger scale productions. The school field will be redesigned to encompass sports pitches and [[Multi-Use Games Area]]s.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Matthew|title=E-ACT school build attracts bumper intake|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/10043993.E_ACT_school_build_attracts_bumper_intake/|accessdate=12 December 2017|work=Winsford Guardian|date=14 November 2012|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===== Closure of former Verdin building =====\nOn 16 July 2013, it was announced that around 60 Academy [[dance]] students from [[Year Nine|Year 9]] and [[Year Ten|10]], performed a [[Choreography (dance)|choreographed]] [[flash mob]] at the front of the former Verdin High School building to mark the end of an [[era]], and to celebrate their move into the new building in September. Laura Wilkinson, Head of Dance discusses the Academy's excitement of the new build and said: \"We've got a brand new dance studio with sprung floors and a new theatre.

Mr Andrew Taylor-Edwards, Principal told the [[Chester Chronicle]] that \"while the proportion of students opting to stay on for Sixth Form study has remained constant, recent cuts to funding have put 'increasing pressure on the financial viability of providing our small post-16 provision'\". He also said that \"we have always prided ourselves in our ability to offer a small Sixth Form provision, allowing students an intimate setting where every student is known and where class sizes are small\". The Academy will not be offering Year 12 study to current Year 11 students from September this year, while remaining fully committed to current Year 12 Sixth Form students who will start their second year of study.<ref>{{cite news|title=Winsford Academy to suspend sixth form provision from September 2016|url=http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/news/chester-cheshire-news/winsford-academy-suspend-sixth-form-8442338|accessdate=7 October 2016|work=Chester Chronicle|date=14 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===== Potential re-establishment =====\nOn 11 May 2015, Mr Peter Rubery, Executive Principal of The Fallibroome Multi-Academy Trust (Academy sponsor), announced that the Sixth Form provision will be re-established at the 'earliest opportunity' and that it is the desire of the Trust to create an 'innovative post 16 provision'. He also discussed concerns over the Academy's previous sponsor and said that it \"made some poor decisions that resulted in overstaffing and budgetary difficulties. These have been addressed and the school will start the new academic year in a stable position, with resources to invest in creating exciting learning opportunities for students and staff\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Winsford Academy sixth form to be re-opened at 'earliest opportunity'|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/12939051.Winsford_Academy_sixth_form_to_be_re_opened_at____earliest_opportunity_/|accessdate=7 October 2016|work=Winsford Guardian|date=11 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 January 2016, Mr Peter Rubery announced that a feasibility study will be undertaken with regard to the potential re-establishment of Sixth Form provision, and will involve consultation with students and parents as well as comparing the Academy's potential offer with the surrounding providers. The Academy are considering a range of qualifications, academic and vocational as well as work-related learning. The feasibility study is designed to fully assess the viability of a new Sixth Form at The Winsford Academy. A further update will be provided later in the summer term, once a new Principal has been appointed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Important Update \u2013 Sixth Form Planning|url=http://winsford.academy/important-update-sixth-form-planning/|accessdate=8 October 2016|work=The Winsford Academy|date=28 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 July 2016, it was announced that a feasibility study has been carried out and the Academy Governors and Sponsor have launched a consultation on the future of the Sixth Form, announcing intentions to re-establish provision in 2019. Mr Peter Rubery said: \"When the Trust was invited to sponsor the Academy in 2014 it was clear to all parties that the Sixth Form was unsustainable. Students in Vale Royal have attractive choices in [[Sir John Deane's College]] and [[Mid Cheshire College]] and it's no surprise that all other schools, bar the catholic sector, do not have Sixth Forms. It was pleasing to note that Ofsted supported our decision to suspend the Sixth Form in 2014 and focus our attention on raising standards in the main school. That objective was achieved and is reflected in a terrific report. Inspectors noted the academic support given to the current Year 13 but agreed that wider provision for personal development for sixth formers was not possible with such low numbers\".\n\nThe last Year 13 students have now left and the Academy Governors are consulting on a formal proposal to close the Sixth Form, and are already planning on what needs to be done to re-establish Sixth Form provision. The feasibility study report points out that according to [[Department for Education]] guidelines, the Academy would need to reapply to open a Sixth Form and would need to meet the criteria for an application. This will involve the Academy proving it can recruit 200 students from the area and sustain the number, offer at least 20 academic A Level subjects and remain financially viable. The report also outlines the financial costs of re-establishing Sixth Form provision totalling around \u00a3300,000, which includes approximately \u00a3250,000 towards staffing costs.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pennington|first1=Josh|title=Winsford Academy aiming to reopen sixth form in 2019|url=http://www.winsfordguardian.co.uk/news/14639897.Winsford_Academy_aiming_to_reopen_sixth_form_in_2019/|accessdate=12 October 2016|work=Winsford Guardian|date=25 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Motto ==\nThe Winsford Academy's [[motto]] is \"Succeed, Aspire, Learn Together\" and its acronym makes the word 'SALT', which is based upon the towns mining heritage and The Verdin Family who founded the Verdin Technical School in 1895 that developed into the present Academy.

It contains an area of {{convert|59399|km2|abbr=on}}. According to the 2002 census, it has a population of 100,000.\n\n==Name==\nThe etymology was discussed in detail in the article ''[http://vip.hnadl.cn/article/read.aspx?id=23982146 On the Place Name

come from Turkic ''(J)yr\u00e6gir'' (\u201cone who is stationed; one who stays\u201d), the name of a Turkic clan, and derived from ''yr\u00e6-'' (verb form ''yryk'', \u201cto be stationed in\u201d) + ''-gir'' (adjectival suffix).\n\nBoth ''(J)yr\u00e6gir'' and ''yryk'' were said to be recorded in the ancient dictionary ''[[D\u012bw\u0101n Lugh\u0101t al-Turk]]'', although the exact Arabic-script forms are unknown, perhaps \u0627\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0643\u0650\u0631\u0652 \u00dcregir, \u064a\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0643\u0650\u0631\u0652 Y\u00fcregir, the 15th clan of the Oghuz.\n\n==History==\nIn

([[Lop Nur]]), is a county in the [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] and is under the administration of the [[Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture]]. It contains an area of {{convert|59399|km2|abbr=on}}. According to the 2002 census, it has a population of 100,000.\n\n==Name==\nThe etymology was discussed in detail in the article ''[http://vip.hnadl.cn/article/read.aspx?id=23982146 On the Place Name Yuli and Rouran]'' ({{lang|zh|\u300a\u5c09\u7281\u5730\u540d\u548c\u67d4\u7136\u6e90\u6d41\u8003\u300b}}) by Li Shuhui ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u6811\u8f89}}).\n\nThe name ''Yuli'' was postulated to have come from Turkic ''(J)yr\u00e6gir'' (\u201cone who is stationed; one who stays\u201d), the name of a Turkic clan, and derived from ''yr\u00e6-'' (verb form ''yryk'', \u201cto be stationed in\u201d) + ''-gir'' (adjectival suffix).\n\nBoth ''(J)yr\u00e6gir'' and ''yryk'' were said to be recorded in the ancient dictionary ''[[D\u012bw\u0101n Lugh\u0101t al-Turk]]'', although the exact Arabic-script forms are unknown, perhaps \u0627\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0643\u0650\u0631\u0652 \u00dcregir, \u064a\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0643\u0650\u0631\u0652 Y\u00fcregir, the 15th clan of the Oghuz.\n\n==History==\nIn

In modern [[bird]]s, the [[rectrices]] attach to these. The pygostyle is the main component of the '''uropygium''', a structure colloquially known as the '''bishop's nose''', '''parson's nose''', '''pope's nose''', or '''sultan's nose'''. This is the fleshy protuberance visible at the posterior end of a [[bird]] (most commonly a [[chicken]] or [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]) that has been dressed for [[cooking]]. It has a swollen appearance because it also contains the [[uropygial gland]] that produces [[preen oil]].\n\n==Evolution==\nPygostyles probably began to [[evolution|evolve]] very early in the [[Cretaceous]] period, perhaps 140-130 million years ago. The earliest known [[species]] to have evolved a pygostyle were members of the [[Confuciusornithidae]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} The structure provided an evolutionary advantage, as a completely mobile tail as found in species such as ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' is detrimental to its use for flight control. Modern birds still develop longer caudal vertebrae in their [[embryo]]nic state, which later fuse to form a pygostyle.\n\nThere are two main types of pygostyle:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} one, found in Confuciusornithidae, [[Enantiornithes]], and some other [[Mesozoic]] birds, as well as in some [[oviraptorosaur]]s like ''[[Nomingia]]'', is long and rod- or [[dagger|dagger blade]]-like. None of the known fossils with such pygostyles show traces of well-developed rectrices. The tail feathers in these animals consisted of [[down (feather)|down]]y fuzz and sometimes 2\u20134 central \"streamers\" such as those found in some specimens of ''Confuciusornis'' or in ''[[Paraprotopteryx]]''.<ref name = clarkeetal2006>Clarke ''et al.'' (2006)</ref>\n\nBy contrast, the function of the pygostyle in the [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] ''Nomingia'' is not known. It is notable however that its older relative ''[[Caudipteryx]]'' had no pygostyle but a \"fan\" of symmetrical feathers which were probably used in social display. Perhaps such ornaments were widespread in [[Caenagnathoidea]] and their relatives, and ultimately the oviraptorosaurian pygostyle evolved to help support them.

The channel was launched as '''TV3''' on 20 September 1998, becoming Ireland's first commercial television channel.\n\n==History==\nIn October 1988, the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland|Independent Radio and Television Commission]] (IRTC) was set up to regulate new independent stations. Following this TV3 was intended to be the Republic of Ireland's third terrestrial channel. The original broadcasting licence was granted to a consortium ''Tullamore Beta Ltd'' in 1990 (some of this consortium made up of Windmill Lane Productions and [[Paul McGuinness]]). It was originally envisaged that the channel would broadcast solely on cable and analogue MMDS, but it was later (1990) decided that the channel should broadcast on some terrestrial UHF transmitters similar to other Irish channels. Initially their signal coverage was much poorer than that of RT\u00c9 but this has been largely addressed since the switchover to [[Saorview|digital television]].\n\nTV3's broadcast was further delayed when IRTC revoked the broadcasting licence due to delays in broadcasting the channel. After a court battle the licence was eventually restored in 1993. By 1993 an agreement was made to sell 49 per cent of the company to [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]], to raise much-needed cash for investment in facilities. However, [[UTV Media|UTV]] pulled out of negotiations in 1995, after TV3 tried to convince existing [[Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service|MMDS]] and [[Cable television#Republic of Ireland|cable]] television providers to drop UTV and replace it with TV3. Cable operators declined to drop UTV Northern Ireland from its line-up.\n\nIn 1997, Canadian communications company [[Canwest]] bought a major stake in the new company. In 2001, Granada purchased a 45% share in the company. By 2006 the group was sold to Doughty Hanson & Co. In 2015, [[Liberty Global]] confirmed it planned to purchase the [[TV3 Group]], approval to purchase the broadcaster was given on 2 October 2015 by the CCPC.<ref>http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/attachment.php?attachmentid=364474&d=1443830705</ref><ref name=\"ccpc.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpc.ie/enforcement/mergers/merger-notices/m15039-liberty-global-tv3|title=M/15/039 \u2013 Liberty Global / TV3|work=ccpc.ie}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, it was announced that the TV3 Group channels would be rebranded as Virgin Media Television on  30 August 2018, with TV3  renamed '''Virgin Media One'''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/tv3-virgin-media-sports-channel-2-4096826-Jun2018/|title=TV3 is officially changing its name \u2013 to Virgin Media One|work=TheJournal.ie|access-date=29 June 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Subsidiary channels==\n===Virgin Media One +1===\nA [[timeshift channel]] TV3 +1 launched on 2 December 2014 on [[Virgin Media Ireland|UPC Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://watchbritishtv.com/saved/business/media-and-marketing/a-new-dawn-for-tv3-as-it-goes-on-the-counter-attack/ |title=A New Dawn For TV3 As It Goes On The Counter Attack |date=November 2014 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The channel was added to [[Sky Ireland]] on 8 April 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/TVThreeIreland/photos/a.10150178101339538.310748.100183534537/10152889844199538/?type=1|title=TV3 \u2013 Timeline Photos \u2013 Facebook|work=facebook.com}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the channel is unavailable to viewers on [[Saorview]], as TV3 were in dispute with its operator [[2RN (RT\u00c9 Networks)|2RN]] (formerly a subsidiary of RT\u00c9) over the non-payment of tariffs over several years by TV3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/rte-and-tv3-in-legal-dispute-31047565.html|title=RTE and TV3 in legal dispute|work=Independent.ie}}</ref> On 30 August 2018, with the rebrand of TV3, TV3 +1 was rebranded as Virgin Media One +1.\n\n===Virgin Media One HD===\nTV3 HD is a high definition version of TV3, both domestic and imported programming is available in HD, mainly sporting content.

The service is currently unavailable on [[Saorview]]. On 30 August 2018, with the rebrand of TV3, TV3 HD was rebranded as Virgin Media One HD.\n\n==Broadcasting policy==\nTV3 broadcasts a wide range of programming which in its early years depended heavily on international acquisitions. In 2008, the TV3 Group produced a three-year strategy to increase the amount of homegrown productions on the channel. Under its contract with the [[Broadcasting Commission of Ireland]] (BCI), TV3 is required since 2008 to have 30% of its programming coming from Ireland though TV3 now produces 40% Irish produced content (most of this content comes from in studio productions such as ''[[Ireland AM]]'' and ''[[Xpos\u00e9]]''). In 2010 TV3 announced a target of 50% Irish programming by 2012. TV3 has also confirmed its plan to build a major new studio in 2011 which will be fully HD capable with audience capacity.<ref name=\"Hancock\" />\n\nThe company has a small staff of 200 employees to run three television channels and one on-demand online service. On average, TV3 spend about \u20ac10 million on internal productions which are generally for daytime viewers. It does not have a history of strong prime-time content; generally its home produced programmes consist of at least one independently produced programme, e.g. The Apprentice, a number of internal documentaries such as Ireland Undercover and a number of BCI licence fee-funded independent products such as School Run, Diary of... and Modern Ireland.\n\nAs of October 2009, TV3 claims to be the most watched television channel by people aged 15\u201324 years old. This group was previously captured by [[RT\u00c9 One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/?act1=record&only=1&aid=73&rid=4282637&tpl=archnewshome&force=1 |title=RT\u00c9 Challenges TV3's Audience Share Findings |publisher=IFTN |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref> This is an important group to capture as it is often these viewers whom advertisers wish to target.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=THE+INSIDE+TRACK-qqqs=mediaandmarketing-qqqid=45193-qqqx=1.asp |title=The Inside Track |publisher=The Sunday Business Post |date= |accessdate=30 August 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In reaction to this press release from TV3, RT\u00c9 rebutted its claims stating that RT\u00c9 One outdoes TV3 in far more demographic categories and that TV3's press release, \"In terms of the selective audiences focussed upon by TV3 in their release, it's clear this is a recent phenomenon and only pertains to a narrow sub-demographic of young viewers in this country.

Increases in programme cost during 2008 included new sporting contracts with the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] and [[UEFA]], the first renewal of its contract with the British broadcaster [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] for shows such as ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' and ''[[Coronation Street]]'', a small but significant increase in programmes commissioned from independent producers. It also increased investment in online technology, with its online service earning a profit for the first time.\n\nIn 2008, TV3 received \u20ac3 million in funding from the licence fee for independent productions on the channel.\n\nIn 2009, two rounds of redundancies reduced TV3 staff to 213 people. Staff savings have been augmented by agreed reductions in wages. The 200 staff working in TV3 now provide seven hours of live television five days a week, an increase of two hours and a staff reduction of 50 since 2007.\n\nIn February 2012 the [[Irish Bank Resolution Corporation]] (IBRC) restructure TV3's outstanding loans to the bank. The owners of TV3, Doherty Hanson & Co., have loans of \u20ac140million with the bank. \u20ac51million will continue to be repaid over the next 5 years, while \u20ac81.1 will be frozen until a \"liquidity event\", according to the IBRC this is in the event of a sale of TV3.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/anglo-to-park-private-equity-companys-80m-loan-in-tv3-deal-3011358.html|title=Anglo to 'park' private equity company's \u20ac80m loan in TV3 deal|last=Laura|first=Noonan|date=7 February 2012|publisher=Irish Independent|accessdate=14 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn TV3 saw losses of \u20ac7million in 2014 and \u20ac17million in 2015, with operating expenses of \u20ac55.6million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/media-and-marketing/tv3-losses-widened-to-17m-last-year-1.2880595|title=TV3 losses widened to \u20ac17m last year|newspaper=The Irish Times|language=en-US|access-date=16 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Product placement===\n[[Product placement]] within Irish produced programming had previously been banned by broadcasting authorities in Ireland, though in the past Irish viewers have been used to product placement as seen on US television and film productions. Due to an [[European Union|EU]] ruling made in 2007, Irish broadcasters can now place products within programming mainly entertainment shows, though excludes programming which is deemed mainly 'news and current affairs' and programming aimed at children.

In general Virgin Media Ireland spends around \u20ac10 million on its Irish productions each year. In 2008 it significantly increased the number of prime time shows produced in Ireland. Under current broadcasting legislation, Virgin Media One is required to use 15% of its total Irish production budget for independent productions. Since 2004 independent productions for the network have been able to avail of the BAI's [[Sound and Vision Fund]], a fund provided to the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]] (BAI) from the licence fee.

The view of many commentators such as Stephen Price of ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' and [[Tom McGurk]] of ''[[The Sunday Business Post]]'' is that TV3 needs to differentiate itself in the growing Irish multi-channel market by making more original programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2002/06/30/story656204628.asp |title=Who needs TV3 |accessdate=7 March 2009 |work=Tom McGurk |publisher=Sunday Business Post |date=30 June 2002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209043154/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2002/06/30/story656204628.asp |archivedate=9 December 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2101-2326325.html |title=Comment: Stephen Price |accessdate=7 March 2009 |work=Stephen Price |publisher=The Sunday Times |date=27 August 2006 |location=London |first1=Fiona |last1=Hamilton |first2=Sam |last2=Coates |first3=Michael |last3=Savage}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/about/2003eng.pdf |title=Radio Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements 2003|accessdate=7 March 2009 |work= |publisher=RT\u00c9 |date=}}</ref>\n\n===''Play TV'' and ''Brainbox''===\n{{main|Play TV (Ireland)|Brain Box}}\n''Play TV'' was an interactive [[Quiz channel|phone-in quiz]] show on TV3: it ran from May 2009 until March 2010.\n\nOn 21 September 2009, callers to the ''[[Liveline]]'' radio show on [[RT\u00c9 Radio 1]] complained about the phone charges and methods surrounding TV3's late night quiz show ''Play TV''. Host [[Joe Duffy]] stated that many of his listeners and callers to the show had not got a satisfactory reply from TV3 in relation to their complaints and hence his reason for this section of his show, and that TV3 was unwilling to be a part of the discussion show having been asked by RT\u00c9 Radio. Some of the contestants had not been paid their prize money. TV3 advised viewers who played the game to go to [[RegTel]] with any complaints.\n\nOn 25 September 2009, the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]] (BAI) met to review 20 complaints made to it by individuals in relation to Play TV; 15 were upheld, 1 was rejected, 1 was determined to be invalid and 2 remained under investigation.\n\nIn January 2010, the compliance committee of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland upheld 10 more complaints against TV3. In February the BAI upheld three more complaints.\n\nOn 5 March 2010, TV3 announced that Play TV's contract was terminated immediately. In their statement they put the removal of the \"infomercial\" down purely to audience figures rather than the complaints received and upheld by the BAI. They did not apologise for their conduct.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0305/breaking70.html | work=The Irish Times | title=TV3 cancels 'PlayTV' contract | date=3 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt the launch of TV3's Autumn (18 August 2010) schedule David McRedmond (CEO TV3) was interviewed by ''[[The Irish Times]]''. He admitted mistakes had been made but and admitted that ''Play TV'' was axed not just due to falling audience figures but also to the bad press and the regulator's constant scrutiny of the show. He still refused to apologise to viewers on behalf of TV3, again stating that \"it was an essential part of getting us through the recession\", regardless of what the BAI called a \"misleading and unfair\" programme.<ref name=\"Hancock\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2010/0820/1224277227972.html|title=Channelling enthusiasm|last=Hancock|first=Ciaran|date=20 August 2010|accessdate=20 August 2010|work=The Irish Times}}</ref>\n\n''Brain Box'' is an interactive [[Quiz channel|phone-in quiz]] show on [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] and [[STV (TV network)|STV]]. As part of the Autumn schedule 2010 TV3 announced the re-broadcast of [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]]'s ''Brainbox'' TV show. The show began airing on TV3 on 9 September 2010, just 7 months after the axing of the controversial ''[[Play TV (Ireland)|Play TV]]''. It ceased broadcasting less than a week later.\n\n===Health of Brian Lenihan===\nOn Saturday, 26 December 2009, TV3 News announced that it had been informed that the then [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] [[Brian Lenihan Jnr|Brian Lenihan]] was suffering from a serious illness. The announcement was made according to TV3 as it was for the public good, but many people were outraged at the way it was announced on TV3.\n\nSenior government sources spoke of \"outrage\" across the political spectrum at the insensitive content and tone of a news bulletin broadcast, which the station had earlier flagged as a \"news story of national importance\". However, the station's decision was defended by ''[[The Irish Times]]'' and the political magazine ''[[The Phoenix (magazine)|The Phoenix]]''. The BAI ruled in favour of TV3 in relation to this announcement, rejecting all 14 complaints made against TV3 to the regulator.<ref>{{cite web|title=Complaint Decisions March 2010 |url=http://www.bai.ie/pdfs/20100322_MarDecisions_AOB.pdf |accessdate=29 March 2010 |work=BAI |publisher=BAI |date=17 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721122810/http://www.bai.ie/pdfs/20100322_MarDecisions_AOB.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nTV3 at the time also stated that the bulletin was a normal bulletin that would normally run at 5:30.

The channel was launched as '''TV3''' on 20 September 1998, becoming Ireland's first commercial television channel.\n\n==History==\nIn October 1988, the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland|Independent Radio and Television Commission]] (IRTC) was set up to regulate new independent stations. Following this TV3 was intended to be the Republic of Ireland's third terrestrial channel. The original broadcasting licence was granted to a consortium ''Tullamore Beta Ltd'' in 1990 (some of this consortium made up of Windmill Lane Productions and [[Paul McGuinness]]). It was originally envisaged that the channel would broadcast solely on cable and analogue MMDS, but it was later (1990) decided that the channel should broadcast on some terrestrial UHF transmitters similar to other Irish channels. Initially their signal coverage was much poorer than that of RT\u00c9 but this has been largely addressed since the switchover to [[Saorview|digital television]].\n\nTV3's broadcast was further delayed when IRTC revoked the broadcasting licence due to delays in broadcasting the channel. After a court battle the licence was eventually restored in 1993. By 1993 an agreement was made to sell 49 per cent of the company to [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]], to raise much-needed cash for investment in facilities. However, [[UTV Media|UTV]] pulled out of negotiations in 1995, after TV3 tried to convince existing [[Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service|MMDS]] and [[Cable television#Republic of Ireland|cable]] television providers to drop UTV and replace it with TV3. Cable operators declined to drop UTV Northern Ireland from its line-up.\n\nIn 1997, Canadian communications company [[Canwest]] bought a major stake in the new company. In 2001, Granada purchased a 45% share in the company. By 2006 the group was sold to Doughty Hanson & Co. In 2015, [[Liberty Global]] confirmed it planned to purchase the [[TV3 Group]], approval to purchase the broadcaster was given on 2 October 2015 by the CCPC.<ref>http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/attachment.php?attachmentid=364474&d=1443830705</ref><ref name=\"ccpc.ie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpc.ie/enforcement/mergers/merger-notices/m15039-liberty-global-tv3|title=M/15/039 \u2013 Liberty Global / TV3|work=ccpc.ie}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, it was announced that the TV3 Group channels would be rebranded as Virgin Media Television on  30 August 2018, with TV3  renamed '''Virgin Media One'''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/tv3-virgin-media-sports-channel-2-4096826-Jun2018/|title=TV3 is officially changing its name \u2013 to Virgin Media One|work=TheJournal.ie|access-date=29 June 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Subsidiary channels==\n===Virgin Media One +1===\nA [[timeshift channel]] TV3 +1 launched on 2 December 2014 on [[Virgin Media Ireland|UPC Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://watchbritishtv.com/saved/business/media-and-marketing/a-new-dawn-for-tv3-as-it-goes-on-the-counter-attack/ |title=A New Dawn For TV3 As It Goes On The Counter Attack |date=November 2014 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The channel was added to [[Sky Ireland]] on 8 April 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/TVThreeIreland/photos/a.10150178101339538.310748.100183534537/10152889844199538/?type=1|title=TV3 \u2013 Timeline Photos \u2013 Facebook|work=facebook.com}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the channel is unavailable to viewers on [[Saorview]], as TV3 were in dispute with its operator [[2RN (RT\u00c9 Networks)|2RN]] (formerly a subsidiary of RT\u00c9) over the non-payment of tariffs over several years by TV3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/rte-and-tv3-in-legal-dispute-31047565.html|title=RTE and TV3 in legal dispute|work=Independent.ie}}</ref> On 30 August 2018, with the rebrand of TV3, TV3 +1 was rebranded as Virgin Media One +1.\n\n===Virgin Media One HD===\nTV3 HD is a high definition version of TV3, both domestic and imported programming is available in HD, mainly sporting content.

On 30 August 2018, with the rebrand of TV3, TV3 HD was rebranded as Virgin Media One HD.\n\n==Broadcasting policy==\nTV3 broadcasts a wide range of programming which in its early years depended heavily on international acquisitions. In 2008, the TV3 Group produced a three-year strategy to increase the amount of homegrown productions on the channel. Under its contract with the [[Broadcasting Commission of Ireland]] (BCI), TV3 is required since 2008 to have 30% of its programming coming from Ireland though TV3 now produces 40% Irish produced content (most of this content comes from in studio productions such as ''[[Ireland AM]]'' and ''[[Xpos\u00e9]]''). In 2010 TV3 announced a target of 50% Irish programming by 2012. TV3 has also confirmed its plan to build a major new studio in 2011 which will be fully HD capable with audience capacity.<ref name=\"Hancock\" />\n\nThe company has a small staff of 200 employees to run three television channels and one on-demand online service. On average, TV3 spend about \u20ac10 million on internal productions which are generally for daytime viewers. It does not have a history of strong prime-time content; generally its home produced programmes consist of at least one independently produced programme, e.g. The Apprentice, a number of internal documentaries such as Ireland Undercover and a number of BCI licence fee-funded independent products such as School Run, Diary of... and Modern Ireland.\n\nAs of October 2009, TV3 claims to be the most watched television channel by people aged 15\u201324 years old. This group was previously captured by [[RT\u00c9 One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/?act1=record&only=1&aid=73&rid=4282637&tpl=archnewshome&force=1 |title=RT\u00c9 Challenges TV3's Audience Share Findings |publisher=IFTN |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref> This is an important group to capture as it is often these viewers whom advertisers wish to target.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/story.aspx-qqqt=THE+INSIDE+TRACK-qqqs=mediaandmarketing-qqqid=45193-qqqx=1.asp |title=The Inside Track |publisher=The Sunday Business Post |date= |accessdate=30 August 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In reaction to this press release from TV3, RT\u00c9 rebutted its claims stating that RT\u00c9 One outdoes TV3 in far more demographic categories and that TV3's press release, \"In terms of the selective audiences focussed upon by TV3 in their release, it's clear this is a recent phenomenon and only pertains to a narrow sub-demographic of young viewers in this country.

It also increased investment in online technology, with its online service earning a profit for the first time.\n\nIn 2008, TV3 received \u20ac3 million in funding from the licence fee for independent productions on the channel.\n\nIn 2009, two rounds of redundancies reduced TV3 staff to 213 people. Staff savings have been augmented by agreed reductions in wages. The 200 staff working in TV3 now provide seven hours of live television five days a week, an increase of two hours and a staff reduction of 50 since 2007.\n\nIn February 2012 the [[Irish Bank Resolution Corporation]] (IBRC) restructure TV3's outstanding loans to the bank.

In general Virgin Media Ireland spends around \u20ac10 million on its Irish productions each year. In 2008 it significantly increased the number of prime time shows produced in Ireland. Under current broadcasting legislation, Virgin Media One is required to use 15% of its total Irish production budget for independent productions. Since 2004 independent productions for the network have been able to avail of the BAI's [[Sound and Vision Fund]], a fund provided to the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]] (BAI) from the licence fee.

Since 2008 TV3 has increased its production of Irish programming. The view of many commentators such as Stephen Price of ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' and [[Tom McGurk]] of ''[[The Sunday Business Post]]'' is that TV3 needs to differentiate itself in the growing Irish multi-channel market by making more original programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2002/06/30/story656204628.asp |title=Who needs TV3 |accessdate=7 March 2009 |work=Tom McGurk |publisher=Sunday Business Post |date=30 June 2002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209043154/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2002/06/30/story656204628.asp |archivedate=9 December 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2101-2326325.html |title=Comment: Stephen Price |accessdate=7 March 2009 |work=Stephen Price |publisher=The Sunday Times |date=27 August 2006 |location=London |first1=Fiona |last1=Hamilton |first2=Sam |last2=Coates |first3=Michael |last3=Savage}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/about/2003eng.pdf |title=Radio Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements 2003|accessdate=7 March 2009 |work= |publisher=RT\u00c9 |date=}}</ref>\n\n===''Play TV'' and ''Brainbox''===\n{{main|Play TV (Ireland)|Brain Box}}\n''Play TV'' was an interactive [[Quiz channel|phone-in quiz]] show on TV3: it ran from May 2009 until March 2010.\n\nOn 21 September 2009, callers to the ''[[Liveline]]'' radio show on [[RT\u00c9 Radio 1]] complained about the phone charges and methods surrounding TV3's late night quiz show ''Play TV''. Host [[Joe Duffy]] stated that many of his listeners and callers to the show had not got a satisfactory reply from TV3 in relation to their complaints and hence his reason for this section of his show, and that TV3 was unwilling to be a part of the discussion show having been asked by RT\u00c9 Radio. Some of the contestants had not been paid their prize money. TV3 advised viewers who played the game to go to [[RegTel]] with any complaints.\n\nOn 25 September 2009, the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]] (BAI) met to review 20 complaints made to it by individuals in relation to Play TV; 15 were upheld, 1 was rejected, 1 was determined to be invalid and 2 remained under investigation.\n\nIn January 2010, the compliance committee of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland upheld 10 more complaints against TV3. In February the BAI upheld three more complaints.\n\nOn 5 March 2010, TV3 announced that Play TV's contract was terminated immediately. In their statement they put the removal of the \"infomercial\" down purely to audience figures rather than the complaints received and upheld by the BAI. They did not apologise for their conduct.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0305/breaking70.html | work=The Irish Times | title=TV3 cancels 'PlayTV' contract | date=3 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt the launch of TV3's Autumn (18 August 2010) schedule David McRedmond (CEO TV3) was interviewed by ''[[The Irish Times]]''. He admitted mistakes had been made but and admitted that ''Play TV'' was axed not just due to falling audience figures but also to the bad press and the regulator's constant scrutiny of the show. He still refused to apologise to viewers on behalf of TV3, again stating that \"it was an essential part of getting us through the recession\", regardless of what the BAI called a \"misleading and unfair\" programme.<ref name=\"Hancock\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2010/0820/1224277227972.html|title=Channelling enthusiasm|last=Hancock|first=Ciaran|date=20 August 2010|accessdate=20 August 2010|work=The Irish Times}}</ref>\n\n''Brain Box'' is an interactive [[Quiz channel|phone-in quiz]] show on [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] and [[STV (TV network)|STV]].

The announcement was made according to TV3 as it was for the public good, but many people were outraged at the way it was announced on TV3.\n\nSenior government sources spoke of \"outrage\" across the political spectrum at the insensitive content and tone of a news bulletin broadcast, which the station had earlier flagged as a \"news story of national importance\". However, the station's decision was defended by ''[[The Irish Times]]'' and the political magazine ''[[The Phoenix (magazine)|The Phoenix]]''. The BAI ruled in favour of TV3 in relation to this announcement, rejecting all 14 complaints made against TV3 to the regulator.<ref>{{cite web|title=Complaint Decisions March 2010 |url=http://www.bai.ie/pdfs/20100322_MarDecisions_AOB.pdf |accessdate=29 March 2010 |work=BAI |publisher=BAI |date=17 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721122810/http://www.bai.ie/pdfs/20100322_MarDecisions_AOB.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nTV3 at the time also stated that the bulletin was a normal bulletin that would normally run at 5:30.

Members of the [[Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec]] (FLQ) [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] the provincial Deputy Premier [[Pierre Laporte]] and British diplomat [[James Cross]].  In response, Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] invoked the only peacetime use of the [[War Measures Act]]. The October Crisis is a violent blemish on Canadain history and nationalism, it is considered to be one of the most serious terrorist attacks in Canada.<ref name=\"October Crisis\">{{cite web |last1=Millette |first1=Dominique |title=October Crisis |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/october-crisis. |website=The Canadain Encyclopedia |publisher=HistoricaCanada}}</ref> The October Crisis is said to be the most detrimental crisis in Canada since the second world war. The  radical group Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) resented the bilingual changes the government of Canada was making and took violent terrorist acts to make their goal of separatism known. October 5th, 1770 four men that belonged to Quebec's most radical separatist group, the Front de Lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ), kidnapped British trade commissioner James Richard Cross from his home in Montreal. This act was done to pursue the Canadain officials to release members of the FLQ that were imprisoned, and to broadcast the FLQ Manifesto on national television, with threat to kill Cross if demands were not met. The provincial and federal government did not expect the situation to develop so rapidly, however the FLQ continued to escalate. Five days after the Cross kidnapping Minister of Immigration and Minister of Labour Pierre Laporte, were also kidnapped.<ref name=\"October Crisis\" /> During the October Crisis the federal and provincial governments, led by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and Premier Robert Bourassa took measures to negotiate with the terrorists and even allowed the FLQ manifesto to be played on the radio. The Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ)\u2019s use of the media was far more extensive and effective during the October Crisis than at any other point in the movement's history. The Lib\u00e9ration Cell of the FLQ released the FLQ manifesto shortly after kidnapping James Cross. The broadcast of the FLQ Manifesto was listed among the seven demands for Cross's release. The Trudeau government initially attempted to suppress its circulation, it reluctantly allowed the French CBC to broadcast the manifesto on 8 October.  As the situation escalated the public became increasingly concerned, the severity of the terrorist acts made government officials and the public believe the FLQ was a large dangerous group.<ref>{{cite web |last1=B\u00e9langer |first1=Damien-Claude |title=FLQ Manifesto 1970. |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/docs/october/documents/FLQManifesto.pdf |publisher=Trent University.}}</ref>\n\nPrime Minister at the time Pierre Trudeau was forced to take drastic measures on October 16th when he invoked the War Measures Act for the first time since the Korean War.<ref name=\"October Crisis\" /> Invoking this act undemocratically derailed civil liberties, minority rights, and social justice, this was extremely controversial.

The Canadain government as a whole was forced to accept bilingualism to have a successful nation. Ottawa, the RCMP, and the Liberals in Quebec City took advantage of the situation to revile separatists and sovereigntists. The experience of martial law pushed separatiste Quebecers closer to the PQ (Province du Qu\u00e9bec). Police raids and illegal persecution of separatist movements only served to harden attitudes toward Ottawa and the party's fortunes further improved. With the crackdown on the FLQ and its marginalization, these voters had no place to go but the PQ. The spontaneous and unorganized energy of the FLQ disappeared soon after the October Crisis but it would take nearly five years to see the extent to which the PQ was the political beneficiary of these events.<ref name=Belshaw />\n\n==Background==\nThe nationalist discontent and rising unemployment in Quebec along with rising foreign imperialism, were motivations for the FLQ to emerge in 1963 to further individuals demands for an independent Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois state. This movement vowed of revolution by taking any means necessary including violence, and almost 200 different crimes including robberies, bombings, vandalism, kidnapping, and murder.<ref name=\"October Crisis\" /> The two founders of this moment where Raymond Villeneuve and Gabriel Hidon both are from Quebec. The FLQ was formed in a time of great change in Quebec including industrial expansion, and modernization of the state. The beginning of the FLQ's violence started in 1963, underground FLQ activists put bombs in mailboxes in three federal armories and in Westmount, a wealthy upper-middle-class anglophone area of Montr\u00e9al. The objective of these crimes was destruction of the influence and symbols of English colonialism. The FLQ provided money and weapons for their movement mainly through robberies. In 1964, five members of the ARQ stole approximately $50,000 in cash and military equipment. These individuals committed an armed robbery at International Firearms and a member of the ARQ killed the company vice-president, another employee was killed by the police, who mistook him for one of the thieves. The five ARQ members were arrested and convicted. After this robbery three members received the death penalty and the other two members a part of it where sentenced to life in prison.<ref name=\"Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec\">{{cite web |last1=Millette |first1=Dominique |title=Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/front-de-liberation-du-quebec |website=The Canadain Encyclopedia |publisher=HistoricaCanada |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1963 to 1970 the [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalist]] group [[Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec]] detonated over 950 bombs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/series/trudeau/jgray2_sep30.html |title=The Globe and Mail: Series \u2013 Pierre Elliott Trudeau 1919\u20132000 |accessdate=April 20, 2008 |quote=Seven people had died and dozens had been injured.

Other targets included [[Montreal City Hall]], [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], armed forces recruiting offices, railway tracks, and army installations. FLQ members, in a strategic move, had stolen several tons of [[dynamite]] from military and industrial sites, and, financed by [[bank robbery|bank robberies]], they threatened through their official communication organ, known as ''La Cogn\u00e9e'', that more attacks were to come.FLQ bombing attacks intensified in 1969 and early 1970. The targets shifted to American-owned businesses; the homes and offices of elected and non-elected civic officials (including the City of Montreal's Mayor Jean Drapeau), a traditionalist nationalist organization and businesses engaged in labour disputes. A National Airlines flight from New York to Miami was hijacked and the Montreal Stock Exchange was bombed: 20 people were injured. Despite the arrest and imprisonment of nearly two dozen members of the movement, it continued to operate and, early in 1970, its members began to roll out a new strategy involving kidnappings and ransom demands. On separate occasions, police foiled plans to abduct the Israeli consul and the American consul-general in Montreal. On 5 October, however, the FLQ was successful in taking James Cross (b. 1921), the British Trade Commissioner in Montreal.<ref name=\"Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec\" />\nWithin the FLQ, two wings emerged to supply the group with weapons and money. Gabriel Hudon's younger brother, Robert, established the Arm\u00e9e de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (ALQ) and Fran\u00e7ois Schirm, a Hungarian and former member of the French ForeignLegion, founded the Arm\u00e9e r\u00e9volutionnaire du Qu\u00e9bec (ARQ).<ref name=\"October Crisis\" />\n\nSlowly the political acts of the FLQ intensified. From 1965 to 1967, the FLQ associated itself with the activities of striking workers, without succeeding in infiltrating the unions. It was involved in over 200 bombings between 1963 and 1970, and in 1968 it began using larger and more powerful bombings. The bombings happened at many different strategic areas such as, at a federal government bookstore, at McGill University, at the residence of Jean Drapeau and the provincial Department of Labour. In February 1969, at the Montreal Stock Exchange, 27 individuals were injured.  In the fall of 1969, the movement split into two distinct cells: the South Shore gang, which became the Chenier cell, led by Paul Rose, and the Liberation cell, under Jacques Lanct\u00f4t both cells based in Montr\u00e9al and both boasted about 12 members.<ref name=\"Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec\" />\n\nBy 1970, 23 members of the FLQ were in prison, including four convicted of [[murder]].

Thus any attempt by the government to suspend the civil rights in Canada, even in an emergency, will be subject to the \"reasonable and justified\" test under section 1 of the Charter.\n\n==Cinema and television==\n* ''Action: The October Crisis of 1970'' and ''[[Reaction: A Portrait of a Society in Crisis]]'', two 1973 documentary films by Robin Spry.<ref name=\"Spry\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/action_the_october_crisis_of_1970 |title=Action: The October Crisis of 1970 |last=Spry |first=Robin |year=1973 |work=Documentary film |publisher=National Film Board of Canada |accessdate=October 5, 2009 }}</ref>\n* ''[[Les Ordres]]'', a historical film drama, directed in 1974 and based on the events of the October Crisis and the War Measures Act; concerning the effect it had on people in Quebec.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreferencelibrary.ca/index.asp?layid=44&csid1=36&navid=46 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215100531/http://www.filmreferencelibrary.ca/index.asp?layid=44&csid1=36&navid=46 |archive-date=December 15, 2006 |title=Les ordres |website=Canadian Film Encyclopedia |publisher=Film Reference Library |access-date=October 3, 2018 }}</ref>\n* Quebec director [[Pierre Falardeau]] shot in 1994 a movie titled ''[[Octobre]]'' which tells a version of the October Crisis based on a book by [[Francis Simard]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://id.erudit.org/iderudit/22979ac |format=PDF |title=Pierre Falardeau tourne Octobre |first=Gabriel |last=Landry |magazine=\u00c9rudit |language=fr |issn= 0707-9389 |issue=71 |date=March 1974 |pages=4\u20138}}</ref>\n* ''[[N\u00f4 (film)|N\u00f4]]'' is partially set in Montreal during the October Crisis and features fictional FLQ members planning a bombing.<ref>{{cite web|title=N\u00f4| url=http://www.newyorkerfilms.com/nyf/t_elements/no/no_pk.PDF |publisher=New Yorker Films |accessdate= March 7, 2008 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060326150407/http://www.newyorkerfilms.com/nyf/t_elements/no/no_pk.PDF |archivedate=March 26, 2006 }}</ref>\n* [[CBC Television]] produced a two-hour documentary program ''[[Black October (film)|Black October]]'' in 2000, in which the events of the crisis were discussed in great detail.

Members of the [[Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec]] (FLQ) [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] the provincial Deputy Premier [[Pierre Laporte]] and British diplomat [[James Cross]].  In response, Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] invoked the only peacetime use of the [[War Measures Act]]. The October Crisis is a violent blemish on Canadain history and nationalism, it is considered to be one of the most serious terrorist attacks in Canada. <ref name=\"October Crisis\">{{cite web |last1=Millette |first1=Dominique |title=October Crisis |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/october-crisis. |website=The Canadain Encyclopedia |publisher=HistoricaCanada}}</ref> The October Crisis is said to be the most detrimental crisis in Canada since the second world war. The  radical group Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ) resented the bilingual changes the government of Canada was making and took violent terrorist acts to make their goal of separatism known. October 5th, 1770 four men that belonged to Quebec's most radical separatist group, the Front de Lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ), kidnapped British trade commissioner James Richard Cross from his home in Montreal. This act was done to pursue the Canadain officials to release members of the FLQ that were imprisoned, and to broadcast the FLQ Manifesto on national television, with threat to kill Cross if demands were not met. The provincial and federal government did not expect the situation to develop so rapidly, however the FLQ continued to escalate. Five days after the Cross kidnapping Minister of Immigration and Minister of Labour Pierre Laporte, were also kidnapped. <ref name=\"October Crisis\" /> During the October Crisis the federal and provincial governments, led by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and Premier Robert Bourassa took measures to negotiate with the terrorists and even allowed the FLQ manifesto to be played on the radio. The Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec (FLQ)\u2019s use of the media was far more extensive and effective during the October Crisis than at any other point in the movement\u2019s history. The Lib\u00e9ration Cell of the FLQ released the FLQ manifesto shortly after kidnapping James Cross. The broadcast of the FLQ Manifesto was listed among the seven demands for Cross\u2019s release. The Trudeau government initially attempted to suppress its circulation, it reluctantly allowed the French CBC to broadcast the manifesto on 8 October.  As the situation escalated the public became increasingly concerned, the severity of the terrorist acts made government officials and the public believe the FLQ was a large dangerous group. <ref>{{cite web |last1=B\u00e9langer |first1=Damien-Claude |title=FLQ Manifesto 1970. |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/docs/october/documents/FLQManifesto.pdf |publisher=Trent University.}}</ref> \n\nPrime Minister at the time Pierre Trudeau was forced to take drastic measures on October 16th when he invoked the War Measures Act for the first time since the Korean War. <ref name=\"October Crisis\" /> Invoking this act undemocratically derailed civil liberties, minority rights, and social justice, this was extremely controversial. The October Crisis waa the first time the act was used during peacetime and the last time it was used in Canada, and has now been replaced with the more limited ''[[Emergencies Act]]'' in 1988. <ref>\u201cThe October Crisis, A radical Quebec group raises the stakes on separation and Ottawa invokes the War Measures Act,\u201d CBC Learning.

In the next two days after the War Measures Act put back into place, more than 250 people were arrested, but it was too late for Laporte. On October 18th his body was found stuffed in the trunk of a car. Six weeks would go by before Cross\u2019s location would be disclosed to police and his kidnappers allowed safe passage out of the country to Cuba. <ref name=\"Belshaw\">{{cite book |last1=Belshaw |first1=John |title=Canadian history: post-confederation |date=2017 |publisher=BCCampus |pages=582-592 |accessdate=April 8 2020}}</ref> In November members of the FLQ were arrested after the police raided the Laporte kidnappers hiding place, others fled.

The Canadain government as a whole was forced to accept bilingualism to have a successful nation. Ottawa, the RCMP, and the Liberals in Quebec City took advantage of the situation to revile separatists and sovereigntists. The experience of martial law pushed separatiste Quebecers closer to the PQ (Province du Qu\u00e9bec). Police raids and illegal persecution of separatist movements only served to harden attitudes toward Ottawa and the party\u2019s fortunes further improved. With the crackdown on the FLQ and its marginalization, these voters had no place to go but the PQ. The spontaneous and unorganized energy of the FLQ disappeared soon after the October Crisis but it would take nearly five years to see the extent to which the PQ was the political beneficiary of these events. <ref name=Belshaw />\n\n\n==Background==\nThe nationalist discontent and rising unemployment in Quebec along with rising foreign imperialism, were motivations for the FLQ to emerge in 1963 to further individuals demands for an independent Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois state. This movment vowed of revolution by taking any means necessary including violence, and almost 200 different crimes including robberies, bombings, vandalism, kidnapping, and murder. <ref name=\"October Crisis\" /> The two founders of this moment where Raymond Villeneuve and Gabriel Hidon both are from Quebec. The FLQ was formed in a time of great change in Quebec including industrial expansion, and modernization of the state. The beginning of the FLQ\u2019s violence started in 1963, underground FLQ activists put bombs in mailboxes in three federal armories and in Westmount, a wealthy upper-middle-class anglophone area of Montr\u00e9al. The objective of these crimes was destruction of the influence and symbols of English colonialism. The FLQ provided money and weapons for their movement mainly through robberies. In 1964, five members of the ARQ stole approximately $50,000 in cash and military equipment. These individuals committed an armed robbery at International Firearms and a member of the ARQ killed the company vice-president, another employee was killed by the police, who mistook him for one of the thieves. The five ARQ members were arrested and convicted. After this robbery three members recieved the death penalty and the other two members a part of it where sentenced to life in prison. <ref name=\"Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec\">{{cite web |last1=Millette |first1=Dominique |title=Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/front-de-liberation-du-quebec |website=The Canadain Encyclopedia |publisher=HistoricaCanada |accessdate=April 8 2020}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1963 to 1970 the [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalist]] group [[Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec]] detonated over 950 bombs.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/series/trudeau/jgray2_sep30.html |title=The Globe and Mail: Series \u2013 Pierre Elliott Trudeau 1919\u20132000 |accessdate=April 20, 2008 |quote=Seven people had died and dozens had been injured.

Other targets included [[Montreal City Hall]], [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], armed forces recruiting offices, railway tracks, and army installations. FLQ members, in a strategic move, had stolen several tons of [[dynamite]] from military and industrial sites, and, financed by [[bank robbery|bank robberies]], they threatened through their official communication organ, known as ''La Cogn\u00e9e'', that more attacks were to come.FLQ bombing attacks intensified in 1969 and early 1970. The targets shifted to American-owned businesses; the homes and offices of elected and non-elected civic officials (including the City of Montreal\u2019s Mayor Jean Drapeau), a traditionalist nationalist organization and businesses engaged in labour disputes. A National Airlines flight from New York to Miami was hijacked and the Montreal Stock Exchange was bombed: 20 people were injured. Despite the arrest and imprisonment of nearly two dozen members of the movement, it continued to operate and, early in 1970, its members began to roll out a new strategy involving kidnappings and ransom demands.

On 5 October, however, the FLQ was successful in taking James Cross (b. 1921), the British Trade Commissioner in Montreal.<ref name=\"Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec\" />\nWithin the FLQ, two wings emerged to supply the group with weapons and money.

From 1965 to 1967, the FLQ associated itself with the activities of striking workers, without succeeding in infiltrating the unions. It was involved in over 200 bombings between 1963 and 1970, and in 1968 it began using larger and more powerful bombings. The bombings happened at many differnt strategic areas such as, at a federal government bookstore, at McGill University, at the residence of Jean Drapeau and the provincial Department of Labour. In February 1969, at the Montreal Stock Exchange, 27 individuals were injured.  In the fall of 1969, the movement split into two distinct cells: the South Shore gang, which became the Chenier cell, led by Paul Rose, and the Liberation cell, under Jacques Lanct\u00f4t both cells based in Montr\u00e9al and both boasted about 12 members. <ref name=\"Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec\" />\n\nBy 1970, 23 members of the FLQ were in prison, including four convicted of [[murder]].

After the defeat of the [[Meech Lake Accord]], which sought to amend the [[Constitution of Canada]] to resolve the passage by a previous government of the [[Constitution Act 1982]] without Quebec's ratification, a pro-independence political party, the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]], was also created at the federal level.\n\nThe deployment of the military as an aid to civil power was very unpopular with the senior leadership of the Canadian Forces.<ref name=\"milhist\"/>{{rp|257}} In the 1950s, the primary purpose of the Canadian Army was to fight against the Red Army in Central Europe if World War Three broke out.<ref name=\"milhist\"/>{{rp|238}} During the Pearson years and even more so under Trudeau, there was a tendency on the part of the government to cut military spending and to shift the role of the Canadian Forces over to more as an internal security force.<ref name=\"milhist\"/>{{rp|256}} In 1968\u201369, Trudeau had seriously considered pulling out of NATO and stayed only to avoid damaging relations with the United States and Western Europe.\n\nOn April 3, 1969, Trudeau announced that Canada would stay in NATO after all, but he drastically cut military spending and pulled out half of the 10,000 Canadian soldiers and airmen stationed in West Germany.<ref name=\"milhist\"/>{{rp|255}} In the same speech, Trudeau stated that safeguarding Canada against external and internal threats would be the number-one mission of the Canadian Forces, guarding North America in co-operation with the United States would be the number-two mission, and NATO commitments would be the number-three mission.<ref name=\"milhist\"/>{{rp|255}} In early 1970, the government introduced a white paper ''Defence in the Seventies'', which stated the \"Priority One\" of the Canadian Forces would be upholding internal security rather than preparing for World War III, which of course meant a sharp cut in military spending since the future enemy was now envisioned to be the FLQ rather than the Red Army.<ref name=\"milhist\"/>{{rp|256}}\n\nThe October Crisis, much to the dismay of the generals, was used by Trudeau as an argument for transforming the Canadian Forces into a force whose \"Priority One\" was internal security.<ref name=\"milhist\"/>{{rp|257}} Many officers knew very well that the \"Priority One\" of internal security was \"a greater threat than any other potential role.\"<ref name=\"milhist\"/>{{rp|255}} By the end of the 1970s, the Canadian Forces had been transformed by Trudeau into an internal security force that was not capable of fighting a major conventional war.<ref name=\"milhist\"/>{{rp|259\u2013260}}\n\nBy 1982, all the convicted participants had been paroled, and all of those sent to Cuba had returned to Canada, some completing short sentences in Canada.\n\nIn 1988, the ''[[War Measures Act]]'' was replaced by the ''Emergencies Act'' and the Emergency Preparedness Act.\n\nThe Emergencies Act is an act of the Parliament of Canada to authorize the taking of special temporary measures to ensure safety and security during national emergencies.\n\nIt received royal assent on July 21, 1988, replacing the War Measures Act. The Emergencies Act differs from the War Measures Act in two important ways:\nFirstly, it was a declaration of an emergency by the Cabinet must be reviewed by Parliament Secondly, any temporary laws made under the act are subject to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Thus any attempt by the government to suspend the civil rights in Canada, even in an emergency, will be subject to the \"reasonable and justified\" test under section 1 of the Charter.\n\n==Cinema and television==\n* ''Action: The October Crisis of 1970'' and ''[[Reaction: A Portrait of a Society in Crisis]]'', two 1973 documentary films by Robin Spry.<ref name=\"Spry\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/action_the_october_crisis_of_1970 |title=Action: The October Crisis of 1970 |last=Spry |first=Robin |year=1973 |work=Documentary film |publisher=National Film Board of Canada |accessdate=October 5, 2009 }}</ref>\n* ''[[Les Ordres]]'', a historical film drama, directed in 1974 and based on the events of the October Crisis and the War Measures Act; concerning the effect it had on people in Quebec.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreferencelibrary.ca/index.asp?layid=44&csid1=36&navid=46 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215100531/http://www.filmreferencelibrary.ca/index.asp?layid=44&csid1=36&navid=46 |archive-date=December 15, 2006 |title=Les ordres |website=Canadian Film Encyclopedia |publisher=Film Reference Library |access-date=October 3, 2018 }}</ref>\n* Quebec director [[Pierre Falardeau]] shot in 1994 a movie titled ''[[Octobre]]'' which tells a version of the October Crisis based on a book by [[Francis Simard]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://id.erudit.org/iderudit/22979ac |format=PDF |title=Pierre Falardeau tourne Octobre |first=Gabriel |last=Landry |magazine=\u00c9rudit |language=fr |issn= 0707-9389 |issue=71 |date=March 1974 |pages=4\u20138}}</ref>\n* ''[[N\u00f4 (film)|N\u00f4]]'' is partially set in Montreal during the October Crisis and features fictional FLQ members planning a bombing.<ref>{{cite web|title=N\u00f4| url=http://www.newyorkerfilms.com/nyf/t_elements/no/no_pk.PDF |publisher=New Yorker Films |accessdate= March 7, 2008 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060326150407/http://www.newyorkerfilms.com/nyf/t_elements/no/no_pk.PDF |archivedate=March 26, 2006 }}</ref>\n* [[CBC Television]] produced a two-hour documentary program ''[[Black October (film)|Black October]]'' in 2000, in which the events of the crisis were discussed in great detail.

Retrieved 27 August 2015.</ref> It stars [[Naseeruddin Shah]] and [[Anupam Kher]]. Set between 2&nbsp;pm and 6&nbsp;pm on a Wednesday,<ref name=red/> the film depicts an about-to-retire [[police commissioner]] (Anupam Kher) narrating a sequence of events that unfolded on a particular Wednesday. There does not exist any written record. The awareness of the incident exists only in his mind and in those of several individuals who were involved, willingly and unwillingly, and how those events affected the lives of all the concerned people. It inspired the Tamil and Telugu simultaneously made films ''[[Unnaipol Oruvan (2009 film)|Unnaipol Oruvan]]'' and ''[[Eeenadu]]'' (both 2009), and the American English film ''[[A Common Man (film)|A Common Man]]'' (2013).\n\nThe film, made at a small budget, was a [[sleeper hit]] at the box office grossing over Rs. 340&nbsp;million worldwide. Despite its low promotion, it was a box office success due to critical acclaim and positive word-of-mouth. [[Box Office India]] declared it a hit. Critics praised the movie for its effective storyline and its twist ending. Subsequently, it won a number of awards including the [[Indira Gandhi Award for Best Debut Film of a Director]] at the [[56th National Film Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Mumbai]] police commissioner Prakash Rathod ([[Anupam Kher]]), resting after a jog, describes in a [[voice-over]] that he is going to retire the following day. He goes on to describe the most challenging case he faced in his career.\n\nAn unnamed man ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]) carries a travel bag, assumed to contain explosives, in the [[Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus]] railway station and proceeds to hide the bag in the restroom of a [[police station]] opposite to the [[Mumbai Police]] headquarters. He then arrives on the rooftop of a building under construction where he has set up his base of operations, equipped with several sim cards, mobile phones and other electronic gadgets. He calls Rathod and informs him that he has placed five bombs in locations throughout Mumbai and has programmed them to explode simultaneously within four hours unless the Commissioner gives in to his demands and releases four [[Insurgent|militants]]. In response, Rathod immediately alerts his team involved in intelligence research and surveillance, tapping all the available resources to trace the location of the caller. Meanwhile, the caller tips off television news reporter Naina Roy ([[Deepal Shaw]]), telling her to reach the police headquarters immediately as it is going to be \"the most important day of her life\". Rathod initially suspects the anonymous caller is bluffing, but his doubts are dispelled as the caller, to prove his seriousness and the police force's helplessness, reveals that a bomb has been planted in the Colaba Police Station right across the Police Headquarter. He further scares them by calling the cell phone attached to the bomb but does not detonate the bomb. Just then Roy reaches the scene on the caller's instructions and reports about the situation.\n\nAs Rathod and his team desperately try to locate the caller, the four militants demanded by the caller are rounded up by police officers Arif ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) and Jai ([[Aamir Bashir]]). In the meanwhile, police depute a young hacker named Anuj to track the location of the caller. The caller then asks the two police officers to leave the four militants near a bench on a [[Juhu Aerodrome|Juhu Aviation Base]] runway, but Arif leaves only three militants behind and takes one of them captive as he suspects that the caller would not reveal the locations of the bombs even after the militants are released.\n\nA phone placed under the bench rings once Arif and Jai are several feet away and an explosion occurs in which the three terrorists perish. Arif relays this information to Rathod, and the anonymous caller reveals he does not belong to any terrorist organization, and his plan was not to free the terrorists but to kill them. The caller sought to avenge all the terrorist attacks they had helped carry out in Mumbai and other major cities of India, specifically the [[2006 Mumbai train bombings]]. His final demand is that the officers kill the fourth militant themselves or he would set off all five bombs in Mumbai. In response, Rathod orders indirectly to Arif and Jai to kill the fourth militant.\n\nAfter the death of the fourth militant is confirmed on the news, the caller calls Rathod for a final time to reveal that he had not planted any other bombs in the city. At this point, Rathod declares he already knew there were no more bombs, hence his decision to kill the last terrorist was not taken in fear but in confidence.

Retrieved 27 August 2015.</ref> It stars [[Naseeruddin Shah]] and [[Anupam Kher]]. Set between 2&nbsp;pm and 6&nbsp;pm on a Wednesday,<ref name=red/> the film depicts an about-to-retire [[police commissioner]] (Anupam Kher) narrating a sequence of events that unfolded on a particular Wednesday. There does not exist any written record. The awareness of the incident exists only in his mind and in those of several individuals who were involved, willingly and unwillingly, and how those events affected the lives of all the concerned people. It inspired the Tamil and Telugu simultaneously made films ''[[Unnaipol Oruvan (2009 film)|Unnaipol Oruvan]]'' and ''[[Eeenadu]]'' (both 2009), and the American English film ''[[A Common Man (film)|A Common Man]]'' (2013).\n\nThe film, made at a small budget, was a [[sleeper hit]] at the box office grossing over Rs. 340&nbsp;million worldwide. Despite its low promotion, it was a box office success due to critical acclaim and positive word-of-mouth. [[Box Office India]] declared it a hit. Critics praised the movie for its effective storyline and its twist ending. Subsequently, it won a number of awards including the [[Indira Gandhi Award for Best Debut Film of a Director]] at the [[56th National Film Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Mumbai]] police commissioner Prakash Rathod ([[Anupam Kher]]), resting after a jog, describes in a [[voice-over]] that he is going to retire the following day. He goes on to describe the most challenging case he faced in his career.\n\nAn unnamed man ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]) carries a travel bag, assumed to contain explosives, in the [[Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus]] railway station and proceeds to hide the bag in the restroom of a [[police station]] opposite to the [[Mumbai Police]] headquarters. He then arrives on the rooftop of a building under construction where he has set up his base of operations, equipped with several sim cards, mobile phones and other electronic gadgets. He calls Rathod and informs him that he has placed five bombs in locations throughout Mumbai and has programmed them to explode simultaneously within four hours unless the Commissioner gives in to his demands and releases four [[Insurgent|militants]]. In response, Rathod immediately alerts his team involved in intelligence research and surveillance, tapping all the available resources to trace the location of the caller. Meanwhile, the caller tips off television news reporter Naina Roy ([[Deepal Shaw]]), telling her to reach the police headquarters immediately as it is going to be \"the most important day of her life\". Rathod initially suspects the anonymous caller is bluffing, but his doubts are dispelled as the caller, to prove his seriousness and the police force's helplessness, reveals that a bomb has been planted in the Colaba Police Station right across the Police Headquarter. He further scares them by calling the cell phone attached to the bomb but does not detonate the bomb. Just then Roy reaches the scene on the caller's instructions and reports about the situation.\n\nAs Rathod and his team desperately try to locate the caller, the four militants demanded by the caller are rounded up by police officers Arif ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) and Jai ([[Aamir Bashir]]). In the meanwhile, police depute a young hacker named Anuj to track the location of the caller. The caller then asks the two police officers to leave the four militants near a bench on a [[Juhu Aerodrome|Juhu Aviation Base]] runway, but Arif leaves only three militants behind and takes one of them captive as he suspects that the caller would not reveal the locations of the bombs even after the militants are released.\n\nA phone placed under the bench rings once Arif and Jai are several feet away and an explosion occurs in which the three terrorists perish. Arif relays this information to Rathod, and the anonymous caller reveals he does not belong to any terrorist organization, and his plan was not to free the terrorists but to kill them. The caller sought to avenge all the terrorist attacks they had helped carry out in Mumbai and other major cities of India, specifically the [[2006 Mumbai train bombings]]. His final demand is that the officers kill the fourth militant themselves or he would set off all five bombs in Mumbai. In response, Rathod orders indirectly to Arif and Jai to kill the fourth militant.\n\nAfter the death of the fourth militant is confirmed on the news, the caller calls Rathod for a final time to reveal that he had not planted any other bombs in the city. At this point, Rathod declares he already knew there were no more bombs, hence his decision to kill the last terrorist was not taken in fear but in confidence. Rathod reaches the caller's location with the help of the young hacker, just as the caller is leaving the place, having destroyed all his gadgets and equipment. The two meet briefly when Rathod, identifying the anonymous caller on the basis of a face sketch, offers the man a ride home and introduces himself.\n\nIn a voiceover, Rathod says the man told him his real name but he does not wish to reveal it since doing so would give away the man's religion. Rathod admits that he knew the caller was disturbed because of the insecure environment and the incompetence of the governing authorities, but he never imagined a common man would go to such lengths to achieve this end. He also notes that the facts of this incident cannot be found in any written record but only in the memories of those who actually witnessed it, and further acknowledges that although the incident has ambiguous moral significance, he personally feels that whatever happened, happened for the best.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Prakash Rathore, [[Commissioner]] of [[Mumbai Police]]\n* [[Naseeruddin Shah]] as \"The Common Man\"\n* [[Jimmy Sheirgill]] as Inspector Arif Khan, [[Anti Terrorist Squad (India)|ATS]]\n* [[Aamir Bashir]] as Inspector Jai Pratap Singh\n* [[Deepal Shaw]] as Naina Roy, UTV Journalist\n* [[Alok Narula]] as Raj Sharma; Naina Roy's Cameraman\n* [[Rohitash Gaud]] as Ikhlaque Ahmed (A terrorist)\n* [[Kali Prasad Mukherjee]] as Ibrahim Khan (A terrorist)\n* Mukesh Batt as Khurshid lala (A terrorist)\n* Vije Bhatia as Mohd.

In addition to [[paper currency]], the BEP produces [[United States Treasury security|Treasury securities]]; [[Commissioned officer|military commissions]] and award certificates; invitations and admission cards; and many different types of [[identification card]]s, forms, and other special security documents for a variety of government agencies. The BEP does not produce [[United States coinage|coins]]; all coinage is produced by the [[United States Mint]]. With production facilities in [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Fort Worth, Texas]], the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is the largest producer of government security documents in the [[United States of America|United States]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bureau of Engraving and Printing, aerial view - Washington, D.C..jpg|thumb|left|180px|upright|Aerial view of the BEP in [[Washington, D.C.]] circa 1918]]\n[[File:United States Souvenir Card HAPEX 1970.jpg|thumb|right|180px|upright|United States Souvenir Card issued by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, for the HAPEX APS 70 exhibition and 84th Annual Convention of the American Philatelic Society in 1970]]\n\nThe Bureau of Engraving and Printing has its origins in legislation enacted to help fund the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  In July 1861, [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] to issue [[paper currency]] in lieu of [[coin]]s due to the lack of funds needed to support the conflict.  The paper [[banknote|notes]] were essentially government [[promissory note|IOUs]] and were called [[Demand Note]]s because they were payable \"on demand\" in coin at certain Treasury facilities. At this time the government had no facility for the production of paper money so a private firm produced the Demand Notes in sheets of four. These sheets were then sent to the Treasury Department where dozens of clerks signed the notes and scores of workers cut the sheets and trimmed the notes by hand. The [[Legal tender#United States|Second Legal Tender Act]] (July 11, 1862; {{USStat|12|532}}) authorized the Treasury Secretary to engrave and print notes at the Treasury Department; the design of which incorporates fine-line engraving, intricate geometric lathe work patterns, a Treasury seal, and engraved signatures to aid in counterfeit deterrence.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Currency|url=https://www.moneyfactory.gov/uscurrency/history.html|publisher=Bureau of Engraving and Printing U.S. Department of the Treasury|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the currency processing operations in the Treasury were not formally organized. When Congress created the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Office of Comptroller of the Currency]] and National Currency Bureau in 1863, currency-processing operations were nominally subordinated to that agency and designated the \"First Division, National Currency Bureau\".  For years, however, the currency operations were known by various semi-official labels, such as the \"Printing Bureau\", \"Small Note Bureau\", \"Currency Department\", and \"Small Note Room\".  It was not until 1874 that the \"Bureau of Engraving and Printing\" was officially recognized in congressional [[legislation]] with a specific allocation of operating funds for fiscal year 1875.\n\nFrom almost the very beginning of its operations, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing designed and printed a variety of products in addition to currency. As early as 1864, the offices which would later become the BEP made [[United States passport|passport]]s for the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] and [[money order]]s for the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office Department]]. Passports are now produced by the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Publishing Office]]. Other early items produced by the BEP included various government debt instruments, such as interest-bearing notes, refunding certificates, compound interest Treasury notes, and [[bond (finance)|bonds]]. The production of [[postage stamp]]s began in 1894, and for almost the next century the BEP was the sole producer of postage stamps in the country.\n\n<gallery widths=\"180px\">\nFile:United States Bureau of Printing and Engraving - 2012-03-15.jpg|15th Street SW entrance to the BEP in Washington, D.C.  \nFile:Bureau of Engraving and Printing, entrance - Washington, D.C..jpg|13th Street SW entrance to the BEP Annex in Washington, D.C.\nFile:Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Fort Worth, TX IMG 7075.JPG|The Bureau's [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] location, with visitor tours available during business hours.\n</gallery>\n\n== Production ==\nThe Bureau of Engraving and Printing officially took over production of postage stamps for the United States government in July 1894. [[Paper currency]] was later produced on hand presses around 1918, utilizing plates capable of printing four [[banknote|notes]] per sheet.\n[[File:James Garfield2 1894 Issue-6c.jpg|thumb|Garfield, Issue of 1894<br>1st postage stamp printed by BEP]]\n\n=== Postage stamp production ===\nThe Bureau of Engraving and Printing officially took over production of postage stamps for the United States government in July 1894. The first of the works printed by the BEP was placed on sale on July 18, 1894, and by the end of the first year of stamp production, the BEP had printed and delivered more than 2.1&nbsp;billion stamps. The [[United States Postal Service]] switched purely to private postage stamp printers in 2005, ending 111 years of production by the Bureau.<ref>{{cite news|last=McAllister|first=Bill|title=After 111 Years, Postage Stamps Go Private|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/12/AR2005061201253.html|accessdate=9 April 2012|newspaper=Washington Post|date=13 June 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"2005CompState-ch2p14\">{{cite web|title=2005 Comprehensive Statement on Postal Operations|url=http://about.usps.com/strategic-planning/cs05/chp2-014.html|publisher=USPS|accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> Starting in 2011 the United States Postal Service in-housed all postage stamp printing services.\n\n=== Currency production ===\n[[Image:Onedolar2009series.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Federal Reserve [[United States one-dollar bill|$1 note]], 2009 issue]]\nPlate capacity on power presses increased from four to eight notes per sheet in 1918 in order to meet greatly expanded production requirements related to [[World War I]].\n\nWith the redesign of [[United States note|currency]] in 1929, the first major change since paper currency was first issued in 1861, note design was not only standardized but note size was also significantly reduced. Due to this reduction in size, the Bureau was able to convert from eight-note printing plates to twelve-note plates. The redesign effort came about for several reasons, chief among them a reduction in paper costs and improved [[counterfeit]] deterrence through better public recognition of currency features.\n\nA further increase in the number of notes per sheet was realized in 1952 after breakthrough developments in the production of non-offset inks. Beginning in 1943, the BEP experimented with new [[ink]]s that dried faster, therefore obviating the need to place tissues between sheets to prevent ink from offsetting to other sheets. The faster drying ink also enabled printed sheets of backs to be kept damp until the faces were printed, thereby reducing distortion caused by wetting, drying, and re-wetting of the paper (sheets needed to be dampened before each printing).\n\n[[Image:Three Consecutively Numbered Two-dollar Notes.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Three consecutive [[United States two-dollar bill|$2 notes]], 2009 issue]]\nBy reducing the distortion that increases proportionally with the size of the sheet of paper, the Bureau was able to convert from 12-note printing plates to plates capable of printing 18 notes in 1952. Five years later in 1957, the Bureau began printing currency via the dry [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method that utilizes special paper and non-offset inks, enabling a further increase from 18 to 32 notes per sheet. Since 1968, all currency has been printed by means of the dry intaglio process, whereby wetting of the paper prior to printing is unnecessary. In this process, fine-line engravings are transferred to steel plates from which an impression is made on sheets of distinctive paper. Ink is applied to a plate containing 32 note impressions, which is then wiped clean, leaving ink in the engraved lines. The plate is pressed against the sheet of paper with such pressure as to actually press the paper into the lines of the plate to pick up the ink. Both faces and backs are printed in this manner&nbsp;\u2013 backs first.

In addition to [[paper currency]], the BEP produces [[United States Treasury security|Treasury securities]]; [[Commissioned officer|military commissions]] and award certificates; invitations and admission cards; and many different types of [[identification card]]s, forms, and other special security documents for a variety of government agencies. The BEP does not produce [[United States coinage|coins]]; all coinage is produced by the [[United States Mint]]. With production facilities in [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Fort Worth, Texas]], the Bureau of Engraving and Printing is the largest producer of government security documents in the [[United States of America|United States]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bureau of Engraving and Printing, aerial view - Washington, D.C..jpg|thumb|left|180px|upright|Aerial view of the BEP in [[Washington, D.C.]] circa 1918]]\n[[File:United States Souvenir Card HAPEX 1970.jpg|thumb|right|180px|upright|United States Souvenir Card issued by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, for the HAPEX APS 70 exhibition and 84th Annual Convention of the American Philatelic Society in 1970]]\n\nThe Bureau of Engraving and Printing has its origins in legislation enacted to help fund the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  In July 1861, [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] to issue [[paper currency]] in lieu of [[coin]]s due to the lack of funds needed to support the conflict.  The paper [[banknote|notes]] were essentially government [[promissory note|IOUs]] and were called [[Demand Note]]s because they were payable \"on demand\" in coin at certain Treasury facilities. At this time the government had no facility for the production of paper money so a private firm produced the Demand Notes in sheets of four. These sheets were then sent to the Treasury Department where dozens of clerks signed the notes and scores of workers cut the sheets and trimmed the notes by hand. The [[Legal tender#United States|Second Legal Tender Act]] (July 11, 1862; {{USStat|12|532}}) authorized the Treasury Secretary to engrave and print notes at the Treasury Department; the design of which incorporates fine-line engraving, intricate geometric lathe work patterns, a Treasury seal, and engraved signatures to aid in counterfeit deterrence.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Currency|url=https://www.moneyfactory.gov/uscurrency/history.html|publisher=Bureau of Engraving and Printing U.S. Department of the Treasury|accessdate=March 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the currency processing operations in the Treasury were not formally organized. When Congress created the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Office of Comptroller of the Currency]] and National Currency Bureau in 1863, currency-processing operations were nominally subordinated to that agency and designated the \"First Division, National Currency Bureau\".  For years, however, the currency operations were known by various semi-official labels, such as the \"Printing Bureau\", \"Small Note Bureau\", \"Currency Department\", and \"Small Note Room\".  It was not until 1874 that the \"Bureau of Engraving and Printing\" was officially recognized in congressional [[legislation]] with a specific allocation of operating funds for fiscal year 1875.\n\nFrom almost the very beginning of its operations, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing designed and printed a variety of products in addition to currency. As early as 1864, the offices which would later become the BEP made [[United States passport|passport]]s for the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] and [[money order]]s for the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office Department]]. Passports are now produced by the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Publishing Office]]. Other early items produced by the BEP included various government debt instruments, such as interest-bearing notes, refunding certificates, compound interest Treasury notes, and [[bond (finance)|bonds]]. The production of [[postage stamp]]s began in 1894, and for almost the next century the BEP was the sole producer of postage stamps in the country.\n\n<gallery widths=\"180px\">\nFile:United States Bureau of Printing and Engraving - 2012-03-15.jpg|15th Street SW entrance to the BEP in Washington, D.C.  \nFile:Bureau of Engraving and Printing, entrance - Washington, D.C..jpg|13th Street SW entrance to the BEP Annex in Washington, D.C.\nFile:Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Fort Worth, TX IMG 7075.JPG|The Bureau's [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] location, with visitor tours available during business hours.\n</gallery>\n\n== Production ==\nThe Bureau of Engraving and Printing officially took over production of postage stamps for the United States government in July 1894. [[Paper currency]] was later produced on hand presses around 1918, utilizing plates capable of printing four [[banknote|notes]] per sheet.\n[[File:James Garfield2 1894 Issue-6c.jpg|thumb|Garfield, Issue of 1894<br>1st postage stamp printed by BEP]]\n\n=== Postage stamp production ===\nThe Bureau of Engraving and Printing officially took over production of postage stamps for the United States government in July 1894. The first of the works printed by the BEP was placed on sale on July 18, 1894, and by the end of the first year of stamp production, the BEP had printed and delivered more than 2.1&nbsp;billion stamps. The [[United States Postal Service]] switched purely to private postage stamp printers in 2005, ending 111 years of production by the Bureau.<ref>{{cite news|last=McAllister|first=Bill|title=After 111 Years, Postage Stamps Go Private|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/12/AR2005061201253.html|accessdate=9 April 2012|newspaper=Washington Post|date=13 June 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"2005CompState-ch2p14\">{{cite web|title=2005 Comprehensive Statement on Postal Operations|url=http://about.usps.com/strategic-planning/cs05/chp2-014.html|publisher=USPS|accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> Starting in 2011 the United States Postal Service in-housed all postage stamp printing services.\n\n=== Currency production ===\n[[Image:Onedolar2009series.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Federal Reserve [[United States one-dollar bill|$1 note]], 2009 issue]]\nPlate capacity on power presses increased from four to eight notes per sheet in 1918 in order to meet greatly expanded production requirements related to [[World War I]].\n\nWith the redesign of [[United States note|currency]] in 1929, the first major change since paper currency was first issued in 1861, note design was not only standardized but note size was also significantly reduced. Due to this reduction in size, the Bureau was able to convert from eight-note printing plates to twelve-note plates. The redesign effort came about for several reasons, chief among them a reduction in paper costs and improved [[counterfeit]] deterrence through better public recognition of currency features.\n\nA further increase in the number of notes per sheet was realized in 1952 after breakthrough developments in the production of non-offset inks. Beginning in 1943, the BEP experimented with new [[ink]]s that dried faster, therefore obviating the need to place tissues between sheets to prevent ink from offsetting to other sheets. The faster drying ink also enabled printed sheets of backs to be kept damp until the faces were printed, thereby reducing distortion caused by wetting, drying, and re-wetting of the paper (sheets needed to be dampened before each printing).\n\n[[Image:Three Consecutively Numbered Two-dollar Notes.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Three consecutive [[United States two-dollar bill|$2 notes]], 2009 issue]]\nBy reducing the distortion that increases proportionally with the size of the sheet of paper, the Bureau was able to convert from 12-note printing plates to plates capable of printing 18 notes in 1952. Five years later in 1957, the Bureau began printing currency via the dry [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] method that utilizes special paper and non-offset inks, enabling a further increase from 18 to 32 notes per sheet. Since 1968, all currency has been printed by means of the dry intaglio process, whereby wetting of the paper prior to printing is unnecessary. In this process, fine-line engravings are transferred to steel plates from which an impression is made on sheets of distinctive paper. Ink is applied to a plate containing 32 note impressions, which is then wiped clean, leaving ink in the engraved lines. The plate is pressed against the sheet of paper with such pressure as to actually press the paper into the lines of the plate to pick up the ink. Both faces and backs are printed in this manner&nbsp;\u2013 backs first. After the faces are printed, the sheets are then typographically overprinted with [[Seal of the United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Seals]] and [[serial number]]s.\n\nDuring [[Fiscal Year]] 2013, the Bureau delivered 6.6&nbsp;billion notes at an average cost of 10 cents per note.<ref name=\"Bureau_cost\">Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
