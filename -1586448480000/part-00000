Written in [[E&nbsp;minor]], it is titled after the [[Lutheran hymn]] \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\", with poetry by [[Johann Franck]] and a [[Chorale|chorale melody]] by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]. [[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail {{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} in a symmetrical structure of eleven movements. Bach set the [[chorale]] tune in various ways, from a four-part setting which begins and ends the work, to a [[chorale fantasia]] and a free setting which only paraphrases the tune. Four verses from the Epistle are set in [[motet]] style, two four five voices, and two for three voices. The central movement is a five-part [[Fugue (music)|fugue]].  Bach used [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and Epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt a 1912 dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorale settings from the motet were included in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of Bach's chorales from {{circa|1735}}. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that it may have been composed for education in both choral singing and theology. The motet, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} It was the first of his motets to be recorded, in 1927.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\nIn the context of late 17th-century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Germany, where and when previous generations of [[Bach family]] members composed their motets\u2014a collection of which was preserved in the {{lang|de|[[Altbachisches Archiv]]}} (ABA)\u2014, motets were choral compositions, mostly with a number of independent voices exceeding that of a standard [[SATB]] choir, and with a German text from sacred scripture and/or based on a [[Lutheran hymn]]. In the latter case, the [[Lutheran chorale|corresponding chorale tune]] was usually adopted into the composition. Instrumental accompaniment was often limited to [[basso continuo]] and/or instruments playing {{lang|it|[[colla parte]]}}. By the time Bach started to compose [[Motet (Bach)|his motets]] along the principles of these older compositions in the 1710s or 1720s, motets were regarded as an antiquated genre.

The fourth (Rom.&nbsp;8:2) and eighth  (Rom.&nbsp;8:10) movements are both [[Trio (music)|trio]]s, the fourth for the three highest voices, the other for the three lowest voices.

Written in [[E&nbsp;minor]], it is titled after the [[Lutheran hymn]] \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\", with poetry by [[Johann Franck]] and a [[Chorale|chorale melody]] by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]. [[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail {{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} in a symmetrical structure of eleven movements. Bach set the [[chorale]] tune in various ways, from a four-part setting which begins and ends the work, to a [[chorale fantasia]] and a free setting which only paraphrases the tune. Four verses from the Epistle are set in [[motet]] style, two four five voices, and two for three voices. The central movement is a five-part [[Fugue (music)|fugue]].  Bach used [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and Epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt a 1912 dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorale settings from the motet were included in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of Bach's chorales from {{circa|1735}}. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that it may have been composed for education in both choral singing and theology. The motet, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} It was the first of his motets to be recorded, in 1927.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\nIn the context of late 17th-century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Germany, where and when previous generations of [[Bach family]] members composed their motets\u2014a collection of which was preserved in the {{lang|de|[[Altbachisches Archiv]]}} (ABA)\u2014, motets were choral compositions, mostly with a number of independent voices exceeding that of a standard [[SATB]] choir, and with a German text from sacred scripture and/or based on a [[Lutheran hymn]]. In the latter case, the [[Lutheran chorale|corresponding chorale tune]] was usually adopted into the composition. Instrumental accompaniment was often limited to [[basso continuo]] and/or instruments playing {{lang|it|[[colla parte]]}}. By the time Bach started to compose [[Motet (Bach)|his motets]] along the principles of these older compositions in the 1710s or 1720s, motets were regarded as an antiquated genre. According to [[Philipp Spitta]], [[Johann Michael Bach]]'s motet {{ill|Halt, was du hast|choralwiki|Halt, was du hast (Johann Michael Bach)|lt=''Halt, was du hast''}}, [[ABA&nbsp;I,&nbsp;10]], which contains a setting of the \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" chorale, may have been on Johann Sebastian's mind when he composed his motet named after the chorale, in E&nbsp;minor like his ancestor's.{{sfn|Spitta|1899|p=[https://archive.org/stream/johannsebastianb02spituoft#page/601 601]}}\n\nBach composed most of [[church cantata (Bach)|his church cantatas]] for occasions of the [[Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)|Lutheran liturgical calendar]] of the time and place where he was occupied. Church cantatas for weddings and funerals fall outside such scheme, and also his motets appear to belong in this latter category.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} Among around 15 extant compositions which at some point or another were designated as a motet by Bach ([[BWV&nbsp;118]], [[motet (Bach)|225\u2013231]], [[BWV Anh.|Anh.]]&nbsp;159\u2013165, [[Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um|deest]]),{{sfn|D\u00fcrr|Kobayashi|1998|pp=228\u2013233, 459, 467}}{{sfn|Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um BWV deest (BC C 8) at Bach Digital}} ''Jesu, meine Freude'' is one of only five (BWV&nbsp;225\u2013229) which, without exception, have always been considered as belonging in that category.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} In eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for SSATB voices.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}} Bach composed only very few works for a five-part choir: most of his other motets are for double SATB choir, while the large majority of his vocal church music is to be performed with one SATB choir.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} Like for most of his other motets, no continuo or other instrumental accompaniment has survived for BWV&nbsp;227, but it is surmised there used to be one.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Melamed|1995}} \n\n===Epistle text and chorale===\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.1|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nThe text of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}} with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]], 8:1\u20132 and 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In the motet, the six hymn stanzas form the odd movement numbers, while the even numbers each take one verse from the Epistle as their text.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The hymn's first line, which [[Catherine Winkworth]] translated as \"Jesu, priceless treasure\" in 1869,{{sfn|CCEL|2020}} is repeated as the last line of its last stanza, framing the poetry.{{sfn|Hymnary text|2020}}\n\n[[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s chorale melody for the hymn, [[Zahn number|Zahn]]&nbsp;8032, was published for the first time in his ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'' of 1653, after which several variants of the [[hymn tune]] were published in other hymnals over the ensuing decades.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}} The tune is in [[bar form]].{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} In the version of [[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch|Vopelius's ''Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch'']] of 1682, the hymnal used in Leipzig, the melody of the first line is the same as that of the last line.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Vopelius|1682|p=[[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch#p. 780|780]]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} The hymn tune appears in several variants in the uneven movements of the motet.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}}\n\nAs a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the Gospel text reflects on Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images.

Jones]] several movements of the motet show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, so that the final arrangement of the work likely happened in the late 1720s, around the time when two other motets which can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]], were written.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The [[Dietel manuscript]], written around 1735, contains three chorales extracted from the motet: the composition of the motet is supposed to have been completed before that time.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\n== Structure and scoring ==\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five. Only the alto, the middle voice in the motet's SSATB setting, sings in all movements. The motet was possibly to be accompanied by instruments playing {{lang|it|colla parte}} in the practice at the time,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} but no parts for them survived.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}\n\nThe music is arranged in different layers of symmetry around the sixth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=202\u2013203}} The first and last movements are the same four-part setting of two different hymn stanzas (indicated with stanza numbers 1 and 6 in the diagram below). The second (Rom.&nbsp;8:1) and penultimate (Rom.&nbsp;8:11) movements use the same themes in [[Fugue (music)|fugal writing]]. The third (stanza 2) and fifth (stanza 3) movements, both five-part, mirror the seventh (stanza 4) and ninth (stanza 5) movements, both four-part. The fourth (Rom.&nbsp;8:2) and eighth  (Rom.&nbsp;8:10) movements are both [[Trio (music)|trio]]s, the fourth for the three highest voices, the other for the three lowest voices.
