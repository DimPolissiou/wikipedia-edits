{"title_page": "History of logarithms", "text_new": "[[File:John Napier-Logarithmorum 1620.jpg|thumb|Title page of John Napier's ''Logarithmorum'' from 1620]]\nThe '''history of logarithms''' is the story of a correspondence (in modern terms, a [[group isomorphism]]) between multiplication on the [[positive real numbers]] and addition on the [[real number line]] that was formalized in seventeenth century Europe and was widely used to simplify calculation until the advent of the digital computer.  The [[Napierian logarithm]]s were published first in 1614. [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] introduced [[common logarithm|common (base 10) logarithms]], which were easier to use. [[mathematical table|Tables]] of logarithms were published in many forms over four centuries. The idea of logarithms was also used to construct the [[slide rule]], which became ubiquitous in science and engineering until the 1970s. A breakthrough generating the [[natural logarithm]] was the result of a search for an expression of [[area]] against a [[hyperbola|rectangular hyperbola]], and required the assimilation of a new [[function (mathematics)|function]] into standard mathematics.\n\n==Common logarithm==\n{{main|Common logarithm}}\n[[Image:Briggs - Canon logarithmorum pro numeris serie naturali crescentibus ab 1. ad 20000., s.d. - 72507.jpg|thumb|''Canon logarithmorum'']]\nAs the common log of ten is one, of a hundred is two, and a thousand is three, the concept of common logarithms is very close to the decimal-positional number system. The common log is said to have [[base (exponentiation)|base]] 10, but base 10,000 is ancient and still common in [[myriad#East Asia|East Asia]]. In his book [[The Sand Reckoner]], [[Archimedes]] used the [[myriad]] as the base of a number system designed to count the grains of sand in the universe. As was noted in 2000:<ref>Ian Bruce (2000) \"Napier\u2019s Logarithms\", [[American Journal of Physics]] 68(2):148</ref>\n:In antiquity Archimedes gave a recipe for reducing multiplication to addition by making use of [[geometric progression]] of numbers and relating them to an [[arithmetic progression]].\nIn 1616 [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] visited Napier at [[Edinburgh]] in order to discuss the suggested change to Napier's logarithms. The following year he again visited for a similar purpose. During these conferences the alteration proposed by Briggs was agreed upon, and on his return from his second visit to Edinburgh, in 1617, he published the first [[chiliad]] of his logarithms.\n\nIn 1624 Briggs published his ''Arithmetica Logarithmica'', in folio, a work containing the logarithms of thirty thousand [[natural number]]s to fourteen decimal places (1-20,000 and 90,001 to 100,000).\nThis table was later extended by [[Adriaan Vlacq]], but to 10 places, and by [[Alexander John Thompson]] to 20 places in 1952.\n\nBriggs was one of the first to use [[finite-difference method]]s to compute tables of functions.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3621843 | last1 = Bruce | first1 = I. | year = 2002 | title = The Agony and the Ecstasy: The Development of Logarithms by Henry Briggs | journal = The Mathematical Gazette | volume = 86 | issue = 506 | pages = 216\u2013227 | publisher =  | jstor = 3621843 | format =  }}</ref><ref name=\"jacques-laporte.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jacques-laporte.org/The%20method%20of%20Henry%20briggs.htm|title=The Difference Method of Henry Briggs|accessdate=2012-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329033744/http://www.jacques-laporte.org/The%20method%20of%20Henry%20briggs.htm|archive-date=2012-03-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nHe also completed a table of [[logarithmic sine]]s and [[logarithmic tangent|tangents]] for the hundredth part of every [[degree (angle)|degree]] to fourteen decimal places, with a table of [[sine|natural sines]] to fifteen places and the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangents]] and [[secant (trigonometric function)|secants]] for the same to ten places, all of which were printed at Gouda in 1631 and published in 1633 under the title of ''Trigonometria Britannica''; this work was probably a successor to his 1617 ''Logarithmorum Chilias Prima'' (\"The First Thousand Logarithms\"), which gave a brief account of logarithms and a long table of the first 1000 integers calculated to the 14th decimal place.\n\n==Natural logarithm==\n{{main|Natural logarithm}}\n[[Image:Saint-Vincent - Opus geometricum posthumum ad mesolabium per rationum proportionalium novas proprietates, 1668 - 877986.jpg|thumb|''Opus geometricum posthumum'', 1668]]\nIn 1649, [[Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa]], a former student of [[Gr\u00e9goire de Saint-Vincent]],<ref>In 1647, Gregoire de Saint-Vincent published his book, ''Opus geometricum quadraturae circuli et sectionum coni'' (Geometric work of squaring the circle and conic sections), vol. 2 (Antwerp, (Belgium):  Johannes and Jakob Meursius, 1647).

When, in the 18th century, this geometric basis was discarded in favour of a fully analytical one, no extension or reformulation was necessary \u2013 the concept of \"hyperbola-area\" was transformed painlessly into \"natural logarithm\".\n\n[[Leonard Euler]] treated a logarithm as an [[exponent]] of a certain number called the base of the logarithm. He noted that the number 2.71818, and its reciprocal, provided a point on the hyperbola ''xy'' = 1 such that an [[area]] of one square unit lies beneath the hyperbola, right of (1,1) and above the asymptote of the hyperbola. He then called the logarithm, with this number as base, the ''natural logarithm''.\n\nAs noted by [[Howard Eves]], \"One of the anomalies in the history of mathematics is the fact that logarithms were discovered before exponents were in use.\"<ref>H.

However, the quarter-square method could not be used for division without an additional table of reciprocals (or the knowledge of a sufficiently simple [[Multiplicative inverse#Algorithms|algorithm to generate reciprocals]]). Large tables of quarter squares were used to simplify the accurate multiplication of large numbers from 1817 onwards until this was superseded by the use of computers.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe Indian mathematician [[Virasena]] worked with the concept of ardhaccheda: the number of times a number of the form 2n could be halved.

We know that B\u00fcrgi had some way of simplifying calculations around 1588, but most likely this way was the use of prosthaphaeresis, and not the use of his table of progressions which probably goes back to about 1600. Indeed Wittich, who was in Kassel from 1584 to 1586, brought with him knowledge of [[prosthaphaeresis]], a method by which [[multiplication]]s and [[division (mathematics)|division]]s can be replaced by [[addition]]s and [[subtraction]]s of trigonometrical values...

These mantissas are all positive and enclosed in the interval {{closed-open|0,1}}. The common logarithm of any given positive number is then obtained by adding its mantissa to the common logarithm of the second factor. This logarithm is called the ''characteristic'' of the given number. Since the common logarithm of a power of {{math|10}} is exactly the exponent, the characteristic is an integer number, which makes the common logarithm exceptionally useful in dealing with decimal numbers. For numbers less than {{math|1,}} the characteristic makes the resulting logarithm negative, as required.<ref>E. R.

The  English mathematician [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] visited Napier in 1615, and proposed a re-scaling of [[Napier's logarithm]]s to form what is now known as the [[common logarithm|common]] or base-10 logarithms. Napier delegated to Briggs the computation of a revised table, and they later published, in 1617, ''Logarithmorum Chilias Prima'' (\"The First Thousand Logarithms\"), which gave a brief account of logarithms and a table for the first 1000 integers calculated to the 14th decimal place.\n\nIn 1624 his ''Arithmetica Logarithmica'', appeared in folio, a work containing the logarithms of thirty-thousand [[natural number]]s to fourteen decimal places (1-20,000 and 90,001 to 100,000). This table was later extended by [[Adriaan Vlacq]], but to 10 places, and by [[Alexander John Thompson]] to 20 places in 1952.\n\nBriggs was one of the first to use [[finite-difference method]]s to compute tables of functions.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"jacques-laporte.org\"/>\n\nVlacq's table was later found to contain 603 errors, but \"this cannot be regarded as a great number, when it is considered that the table was the result of an original calculation, and that more than 2,100,000 printed figures are liable to error.\"<ref>''Athenaeum,'' 15 June 1872.  See also the ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'' for May 1872.</ref>  An edition of Vlacq's work, containing many corrections, was issued at [[Leipzig]] in 1794 under the title ''Thesaurus Logarithmorum Completus'' by [[Jurij Vega]].\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Callet]]'s seven-place table ([[Paris]], 1795), instead of stopping at 100,000, gave the eight-place logarithms of the numbers between 100,000 and 108,000, in order to diminish the errors of [[interpolation]], which were greatest in the early part of the table, and this addition was generally included in seven-place tables. The only important published extension of Vlacq's table was made by Mr. Sang in 1871, whose table contained the seven-place logarithms of all numbers below 200,000.\n\nBriggs and Vlacq also published original tables of the logarithms of the [[trigonometric function]]s. Briggs completed a table of [[logarithmic sine]]s and [[logarithmic tangent]]s for the hundredth part of every [[degree (angle)|degree]] to fourteen decimal places, with a table of [[sine|natural sines]] to fifteen places and the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangents]] and [[secant (trigonometric function)|secants]] for the same to ten places, all of which were printed at Gouda in 1631 and published in 1633 under the title of ''Trigonometria Britannica''. Tables logarithms of trigonometric functions simplify hand calculations where a function of an angle must be multiplied by another number, as is often the case.\n\nBesides the tables mentioned above, a great collection, called ''Tables du Cadastre,'' was constructed under the direction of [[Gaspard de Prony]], by an original computation, under the auspices of the [[France|French]] republican government of the 1790s.  This work, which contained the logarithms of all numbers up to 100,000 to nineteen places, and of the numbers between 100,000 and 200,000 to twenty-four places, exists only in manuscript, \"in seventeen enormous folios,\" at the Observatory of Paris.

[[Edmund Gunter]] of Oxford developed a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale; with additional measuring tools it could be used to multiply and divide. The first description of this scale was published in Paris in 1624 by [[Edmund Wingate]] (c.1593\u20131656), an English mathematician, in a book entitled ''L'usage de la reigle de proportion en l'arithmetique & geometrie''. The book contains a double scale, logarithmic on one side, tabular on the other. In 1630, [[William Oughtred]] of Cambridge invented a circular slide rule, and in 1632 combined two handheld [[Gunter's scale|Gunter rule]]s to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule. Like his contemporary at Cambridge, [[Isaac Newton]], Oughtred taught his ideas privately to his students.  Also like Newton, he became involved in a vitriolic controversy over priority, with his one-time student [[Richard Delamain]] and the prior claims of Wingate. Oughtred's ideas were only made public in publications of his student William Forster in 1632 and 1653.\n\nIn 1677, [[Henry Coggeshall]] created a two-foot folding rule for timber measure, called the [[Coggeshall slide rule]], expanding the slide rule's use beyond mathematical inquiry.\n\nIn 1722, Warner introduced the two- and three-decade scales, and in 1755 Everard included an inverted scale; a slide rule containing all of these scales is usually known as a \"polyphase\" rule.\n\nIn 1815, [[Peter Mark Roget]] invented the log log slide rule, which included a scale displaying the logarithm of the logarithm. This allowed the user to directly perform calculations involving roots and exponents. This was especially useful for fractional powers.\n\nIn 1821, [[Nathaniel Bowditch]], described in the ''[[American Practical Navigator]]'' a \"sliding rule\" that contained scales trigonometric functions on the fixed part and a line of log-sines and log-tans on the slider used to solve navigation problems.\n\nIn 1845, Paul Cameron of Glasgow introduced a Nautical Slide-Rule capable of answering navigation questions, including [[right ascension]] and [[declination]] of the sun and principal stars.<ref>\"Cameron's Nautical Slide Rule\", The Practical Mechanic and Engineer's Magazine, April 1845, p187 and Plate XX-B</ref>\n\n===Modern form===\n[[File:Slideruleinuse.wpafb.chap2-2.jpg|thumb|Engineer using a slide rule, with [[mechanical calculator]] in background, mid 20th century]]\nA more modern form of slide rule was created in 1859 by French artillery lieutenant [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Mannheim]], \"who was fortunate in having his rule made by a firm of national reputation and in having it adopted by the French Artillery.\" It was around this time that [[engineering]] became a recognized profession, resulting in widespread slide rule use in Europe\u2013but not in the United States.  There Edwin Thacher's cylindrical rule took hold after 1881.

The [[Napierian logarithm]]s were published first in 1614. [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] introduced [[common logarithm|common (base 10) logarithms]], which were easier to use. [[mathematical table|Tables]] of logarithms were published in many forms over four centuries. The idea of logarithms was also used to construct the [[slide rule]], which became ubiquitous in science and engineering until the 1970s. A breakthrough generating the [[natural logarithm]] was the result of a search for an expression of [[area]] against a [[hyperbola|rectangular hyperbola]], and required the assimilation of a new [[function (mathematics)|function]] into standard mathematics.\n\n==Common logarithm==\n{{main|Common logarithm}}\n[[Image:Briggs - Canon logarithmorum pro numeris serie naturali crescentibus ab 1. ad 20000., s.d. - 72507.jpg|thumb|''Canon logarithmorum'']]\nAs the common log of ten is one, of a hundred is two, and a thousand is three, the concept of common logarithms is very close to the decimal-positional number system. The common log is said to have [[base (exponentiation)|base]] 10, but base 10,000 is ancient and still common in [[myriad#East Asia|East Asia]]. In his book [[The Sand Reckoner]], [[Archimedes]] used the [[myriad]] as the base of a number system designed to count the grains of sand in the universe. As was noted in 2000:<ref>Ian Bruce (2000) \"Napier\u2019s Logarithms\", [[American Journal of Physics]] 68(2):148</ref>\n:In antiquity Archimedes gave a recipe for reducing multiplication to addition by making use of [[geometric progression]] of numbers and relating them to an [[arithmetic progression]].\nIn 1616 [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] visited Napier at [[Edinburgh]] in order to discuss the suggested change to Napier's logarithms. The following year he again visited for a similar purpose. During these conferences the alteration proposed by Briggs was agreed upon, and on his return from his second visit to Edinburgh, in 1617, he published the first [[chiliad]] of his logarithms.\n\nIn 1624 Briggs published his ''Arithmetica Logarithmica'', in folio, a work containing the logarithms of thirty thousand [[natural number]]s to fourteen decimal places (1-20,000 and 90,001 to 100,000).\nThis table was later extended by [[Adriaan Vlacq]], but to 10 places, and by [[Alexander John Thompson]] to 20 places in 1952.\n\nBriggs was one of the first to use [[finite-difference method]]s to compute tables of functions.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3621843 | last1 = Bruce | first1 = I. | year = 2002 | title = The Agony and the Ecstasy: The Development of Logarithms by Henry Briggs | journal = The Mathematical Gazette | volume = 86 | issue = 506 | pages = 216\u2013227 | publisher =  | jstor = 3621843 | format =  }}</ref><ref name=\"jacques-laporte.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jacques-laporte.org/The%20method%20of%20Henry%20briggs.htm|title=The Difference Method of Henry Briggs|accessdate=2012-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329033744/http://www.jacques-laporte.org/The%20method%20of%20Henry%20briggs.htm|archive-date=2012-03-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nHe also completed a table of [[logarithmic sine]]s and [[logarithmic tangent|tangents]] for the hundredth part of every [[degree (angle)|degree]] to fourteen decimal places, with a table of [[sine|natural sines]] to fifteen places and the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangents]] and [[secant (trigonometric function)|secants]] for the same to ten places, all of which were printed at Gouda in 1631 and published in 1633 under the title of ''Trigonometria Britannica''; this work was probably a successor to his 1617 ''Logarithmorum Chilias Prima'' (\"The First Thousand Logarithms\"), which gave a brief account of logarithms and a long table of the first 1000 integers calculated to the 14th decimal place.\n\n==Natural logarithm==\n{{main|Natural logarithm}}\n[[Image:Saint-Vincent - Opus geometricum posthumum ad mesolabium per rationum proportionalium novas proprietates, 1668 - 877986.jpg|thumb|''Opus geometricum posthumum'', 1668]]\nIn 1649, [[Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa]], a former student of [[Gr\u00e9goire de Saint-Vincent]],<ref>In 1647, Gregoire de Saint-Vincent published his book, ''Opus geometricum quadraturae circuli et sectionum coni'' (Geometric work of squaring the circle and conic sections), vol. 2 (Antwerp, (Belgium):  Johannes and Jakob Meursius, 1647).

When, in the 18th century, this geometric basis was discarded in favour of a fully analytical one, no extension or reformulation was necessary \u2013 the concept of \"hyperbola-area\" was transformed painlessly into \"natural logarithm\".\n\n[[Leonard Euler]] treated a logarithm as an [[exponent]] of a certain number called the base of the logarithm. He noted that the number 2.71828, and its reciprocal, provided a point on the hyperbola ''xy'' = 1 such that an [[area]] of one square unit lies beneath the hyperbola, right of (1,1) and above the asymptote of the hyperbola. He then called the logarithm, with this number as base, the ''natural logarithm''.\n\nAs noted by [[Howard Eves]], \"One of the anomalies in the history of mathematics is the fact that logarithms were discovered before exponents were in use.\"<ref>H.

For exact [[power of two|powers of 2]], this equals the binary logarithm, but it differs from the logarithm for other numbers. He described a product formula for this concept and also introduced analogous concepts for base 3 (trakacheda) and base 4 (caturthacheda).<ref>{{citation| contribution=History of Mathematics in India|title=Students' Britannica India: Select essays|editor1-first=Dale|editor1-last=Hoiberg|editor-link1=Dale Hoiberg|editor2-first=Indu|editor2-last=Ramchandani|first=R.

This used the trigonometric identity\n:<math>\\cos\\alpha\\cos\\beta = \\frac12[\\cos(\\alpha+\\beta) + \\cos(\\alpha-\\beta)]</math>\nor similar to convert the multiplications to additions and table lookups. However, logarithms are more straightforward and require less work. It can be shown using [[Euler's formula]] that the two techniques are related.\n\n===B\u00fcrgi===\nThe Swiss mathematician [[Jost B\u00fcrgi]] constructed a table of progressions which can be considered a table of [[antilogarithm]]s<ref>Jost B\u00fcrgi, ''Arithmetische und Geometrische Progress Tabulen'' \u2026 [Arithmetic and Geometric Progression Tables \u2026 ],  (Prague, (Czech Republic):  University [of Prague] Press, 1620).

Neither the table nor the instructions were published, apparently only proof sheets of the table were printed. The contents of the instructions were reproduced in:  Hermann Robert Gieswald, ''Justus Byrg als Mathematiker, und dessen Einleitung zu seinen Logarithmen'' [Justus Byrg as a mathematician, and an introduction to his logarithms] (Danzig, Prussia:  St. Johannisschule, 1856), [https://books.google.com/books?id=xPhSAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q&f=false pages 26 ff.]</ref> independently of [[John Napier]], whose publication (1614) was known by the time B\u00fcrgi published at the behest of [[Johannes Kepler]]. We know that B\u00fcrgi had some way of simplifying calculations around 1588, but most likely this way was the use of prosthaphaeresis, and not the use of his table of progressions which probably goes back to about 1600. Indeed Wittich, who was in Kassel from 1584 to 1586, brought with him knowledge of [[prosthaphaeresis]], a method by which [[multiplication]]s and [[division (mathematics)|division]]s can be replaced by [[addition]]s and [[subtraction]]s of trigonometrical values...

These mantissas are all positive and enclosed in the interval {{closed-open|0,1}}. The common logarithm of any given positive number is then obtained by adding its mantissa to the common logarithm of the second factor. This logarithm is called the ''characteristic'' of the given number. Since the common logarithm of a power of {{math|10}} is exactly the exponent, the characteristic is an integer number, which makes the common logarithm exceptionally useful in dealing with decimal numbers. For numbers less than {{math|1,}} the characteristic makes the resulting logarithm negative, as required.<ref>E. R.

The  English mathematician [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] visited Napier in 1615, and proposed a re-scaling of [[Napier's logarithm]]s to form what is now known as the [[common logarithm|common]] or base-10 logarithms. Napier delegated to Briggs the computation of a revised table, and they later published, in 1617, ''Logarithmorum Chilias Prima'' (\"The First Thousand Logarithms\"), which gave a brief account of logarithms and a table for the first 1000 integers calculated to the 14th decimal place.\n\nIn 1624 his ''Arithmetica Logarithmica'', appeared in folio, a work containing the logarithms of thirty-thousand [[natural number]]s to fourteen decimal places (1-20,000 and 90,001 to 100,000). This table was later extended by [[Adriaan Vlacq]], but to 10 places, and by [[Alexander John Thompson]] to 20 places in 1952.\n\nBriggs was one of the first to use [[finite-difference method]]s to compute tables of functions.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"jacques-laporte.org\"/>\n\nVlacq's table was later found to contain 603 errors, but \"this cannot be regarded as a great number, when it is considered that the table was the result of an original calculation, and that more than 2,100,000 printed figures are liable to error.\"<ref>''Athenaeum,'' 15 June 1872.  See also the ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'' for May 1872.</ref>  An edition of Vlacq's work, containing many corrections, was issued at [[Leipzig]] in 1794 under the title ''Thesaurus Logarithmorum Completus'' by [[Jurij Vega]].\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois Callet]]'s seven-place table ([[Paris]], 1795), instead of stopping at 100,000, gave the eight-place logarithms of the numbers between 100,000 and 108,000, in order to diminish the errors of [[interpolation]], which were greatest in the early part of the table, and this addition was generally included in seven-place tables. The only important published extension of Vlacq's table was made by Mr. Sang in 1871, whose table contained the seven-place logarithms of all numbers below 200,000.\n\nBriggs and Vlacq also published original tables of the logarithms of the [[trigonometric function]]s. Briggs completed a table of [[logarithmic sine]]s and [[logarithmic tangent]]s for the hundredth part of every [[degree (angle)|degree]] to fourteen decimal places, with a table of [[sine|natural sines]] to fifteen places and the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangents]] and [[secant (trigonometric function)|secants]] for the same to ten places, all of which were printed at Gouda in 1631 and published in 1633 under the title of ''Trigonometria Britannica''. Tables logarithms of trigonometric functions simplify hand calculations where a function of an angle must be multiplied by another number, as is often the case.\n\nBesides the tables mentioned above, a great collection, called ''Tables du Cadastre,'' was constructed under the direction of [[Gaspard de Prony]], by an original computation, under the auspices of the [[France|French]] republican government of the 1790s.  This work, which contained the logarithms of all numbers up to 100,000 to nineteen places, and of the numbers between 100,000 and 200,000 to twenty-four places, exists only in manuscript, \"in seventeen enormous folios,\" at the Observatory of Paris.

[[Edmund Gunter]] of Oxford developed a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale; with additional measuring tools it could be used to multiply and divide. The first description of this scale was published in Paris in 1624 by [[Edmund Wingate]] (c.1593\u20131656), an English mathematician, in a book entitled ''L'usage de la reigle de proportion en l'arithmetique & geometrie''. The book contains a double scale, logarithmic on one side, tabular on the other. In 1630, [[William Oughtred]] of Cambridge invented a circular slide rule, and in 1632 combined two handheld [[Gunter's scale|Gunter rule]]s to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule. Like his contemporary at Cambridge, [[Isaac Newton]], Oughtred taught his ideas privately to his students.  Also like Newton, he became involved in a vitriolic controversy over priority, with his one-time student [[Richard Delamain]] and the prior claims of Wingate. Oughtred's ideas were only made public in publications of his student William Forster in 1632 and 1653.\n\nIn 1677, [[Henry Coggeshall]] created a two-foot folding rule for timber measure, called the [[Coggeshall slide rule]], expanding the slide rule's use beyond mathematical inquiry.\n\nIn 1722, Warner introduced the two- and three-decade scales, and in 1755 Everard included an inverted scale; a slide rule containing all of these scales is usually known as a \"polyphase\" rule.\n\nIn 1815, [[Peter Mark Roget]] invented the log log slide rule, which included a scale displaying the logarithm of the logarithm. This allowed the user to directly perform calculations involving roots and exponents. This was especially useful for fractional powers.\n\nIn 1821, [[Nathaniel Bowditch]], described in the ''[[American Practical Navigator]]'' a \"sliding rule\" that contained scales trigonometric functions on the fixed part and a line of log-sines and log-tans on the slider used to solve navigation problems.\n\nIn 1845, Paul Cameron of Glasgow introduced a Nautical Slide-Rule capable of answering navigation questions, including [[right ascension]] and [[declination]] of the sun and principal stars.<ref>\"Cameron's Nautical Slide Rule\", The Practical Mechanic and Engineer's Magazine, April 1845, p187 and Plate XX-B</ref>\n\n===Modern form===\n[[File:Slideruleinuse.wpafb.chap2-2.jpg|thumb|Engineer using a slide rule, with [[mechanical calculator]] in background, mid 20th century]]\nA more modern form of slide rule was created in 1859 by French artillery lieutenant [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Mannheim]], \"who was fortunate in having his rule made by a firm of national reputation and in having it adopted by the French Artillery.\" It was around this time that [[engineering]] became a recognized profession, resulting in widespread slide rule use in Europe\u2013but not in the United States.  There Edwin Thacher's cylindrical rule took hold after 1881. The duplex rule was invented by William Cox in 1891, and was produced by [[Keuffel and Esser Co.]] of New York.<ref name=\"fn_3\">{{cite book|url=http://www.mccoys-kecatalogs.com/K&EManuals/4081-3_1943/4081-3_1943.htm |title=The Log-Log Duplex Decitrig Slide Rule No. 4081: A Manual |publisher=Keuffel & Esser |first1=Lyman M. |last1=Kells |first2=Willis F. |last2=Kern |first3=James R. |last3=Bland |year=1943 |page=92 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214020502/http://www.mccoys-kecatalogs.com/K%26EManuals/4081-3_1943/4081-3_1943.htm |archivedate=14 February 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"fn_4\">''The Polyphase Duplex Slide Rule, A Self-Teaching Manual'', Breckenridge, 1922, p. 20.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Original sources===\n* [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] (1624) ''Arithmetica Logarithmica''\n* [[Gr\u00e9goire de Saint-Vincent]] (1647) ''Opus Geometricum Quadraturae Circuli et Sectionum Coni''\n* [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1651) [https://archive.org/stream/uvrescompltespu00haargoog#page/n319/mode/2up Theoremata de quadratura hyperboles, ellipsis et circuli], in ''Oeuvres Compl\u00e8tes'', Tome XI, link from [[Internet Archive]].\n* [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] (1667) [https://archive.org/details/ita-bnc-mag-00001357-001/page/n10 Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura], Padua: Patavii, via Internet Archive\n* [[William Brouncker (mathematician)|William Brouncker]] (1667) [http://www.biodiversityheritagelibrary.org/item/75194#page/267/mode/1up The Squaring of the Hyperbola], [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]], abridged edition 1809, v. i, pp 233\u20136, link form [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]].\n* [[Nicholas Mercator]] (1668) ''Logarithmitechnia'', London\n\n===Secondary sources===\n* Frances Maseres (1791) [https://books.google.ca/books?id=FZciAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover Scriptores Logarithmici, or a collection of several curious tracts on the nature and construction of logarithms], link from [[Google Books]].\n* Karl Bopp (1907) \"Die Kegelschnitte der Gregorius a St. Vincentio\", ''Abhandlungen zum Geschichte der mathematische Wissenschaft'', XX Heft. \n* [[Florian Cajori]] (1913) \"History of the exponential and logarithm concepts\", [[American Mathematical Monthly]] 20: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2973509?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents pages 5 to 14], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2974078?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents pages 35 to 47], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2973441?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents pages 75 to 84], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2972960?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents pages 107 to 117], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2972412?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents pages 148 to 151], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2973069?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents pages 173 to 182], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2974104?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents pages 205 to 210], links from [[Jstor]]\n* George A.
