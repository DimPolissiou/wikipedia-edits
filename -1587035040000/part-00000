{"title_page": "Consideration", "text_new": "{{short description|Concept of legal value in connection with contracts}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{wiktionary}}\n{{Contract law}}\n'''Konsideratisjon''' is a concept of [[English law|English]] [[common law]] and is a necessity for simple contracts but not for special contracts (contracts by [[deed]]). The concept has been adopted by other common law jurisdictions, including the US.\n\nThe court in ''Currie v Misa'' <ref>''Currie v Misa''  (1875)  LR 10 Ex 893</ref> declared consideration to be a \u201cRight,  Interest,  Profit,  Benefit, or Forbearance,  Detriment,  Loss,  Responsibility\u201d. Thus, consideration is a promise of something of value given by a promissor in exchange for something of value given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable '''only''' if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.<ref>''Wade v Simeon'' (1846)  2 CB 548</ref><ref>''White v Bluett''  (1853)  2 WR 75</ref><ref>Bronaugh R. (1976). [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2434&context=wmlr Agreement, Mistake, and Objectivity in the Bargain Theory of Conflict]. ''William & Mary Law Review''.</ref>\n\nConsideration may be thought of as the concept of value offered and accepted by people or organisations entering into [[contract]]s. Anything of value promised by one party to the other when making a contract can be treated as \"consideration\": for example, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $5,000, A's consideration is the $5,000, and B's consideration is the car.\n\nAdditionally, if A signs a contract with B such that A will paint B's house for $500, A's consideration is the service of painting B's house, and B's consideration is $500 paid to A. Further, if A signs a contract with B such that A will ''not'' repaint his own house in any other color than white, and B will pay A $500 per year to keep this deal up, there is also consideration. Although A did not promise to affirmatively do anything, A did promise ''not'' to do something that he was allowed to do, and so A did pass consideration. A's consideration to B is the ''forbearance'' in painting his own house in a color other than white, and B's consideration to A is $500 per year. Conversely, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $0, B's consideration is still the car, but A is giving no consideration, and so there is no valid contract. However, if B still gives the title to the car to A, then B cannot take the car back, since, while it may not be a valid contract, it ''is'' a valid [[Gift (law)|gift]].\n\nIn [[common law]] it is a prerequisite that both parties offer consideration before a contract can be thought of as binding. The doctrine of consideration is irrelevant in many jurisdictions, although contemporary commercial litigant relations have held the relationship between a promise and a deed is a reflection of the nature of contractual considerations. If there is no element of consideration found, there is thus no contract formed.\n\nHowever, even if a court decides there is no contract, there might be a possible recovery under the doctrines of ''[[quantum meruit]]'' (sometimes referred to as a [[quasi-contract]]) or [[Estoppel#Promissory estoppel|promissory estoppel]].\n\n==Legal rules regarding consideration==\nThere are a number of common issues as to whether consideration exists in a contract:\n# Part payment is not good consideration <ref> ''[[Pinnel's Case]]'' (1602)  5 Co Rep 117a</ref><ref> ''[[Jorden v Money]]'' (1854) 5 HLC 185</ref><ref> ''[[Foakes v Beer]]''  ''([[per incuriam]]?)''

Atiyah, 'Consideration: A Restatement' in ''Essays on Contract'' (1986) p.195, Oxford University Press</ref> However, [[legislation]], rather than judicial development, has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine. [[Lord Denning|Lord Justice Denning]] famously stated that \"The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind\".<ref>[[Central London Property Trust Ltd. v. High Trees House Ltd.]] [1947] KB 130</ref>\n\nThe reason that both exist in common law jurisdictions is thought by leading scholars to be the result of the combining by 19th century judges of two distinct threads: first the consideration requirement was at the heart of the action of [[assumpsit]], which had grown up in medieval times and remained the normal action for breach of a simple contract in England and Wales until 1884, when the old forms of action were abolished; secondly, the notion of agreement between two or more parties as being the essential legal and moral foundation of contract in all legal systems, was promoted by the 18th century French writer Pothier in his ''Traite des Obligations'', much read (especially after translation into English in 1805) by English judges and jurists. The latter chimed well with the fashionable will theories of the time, especially [[John Stuart Mill]]'s influential ideas on free will, and got grafted on to the traditional common law requirement for consideration to ground an action in assumpsit.<ref>For a detailed and authoritative account of this process, see [[A. W. B. Simpson]], ''A History of the Common Law of Contract: The Rise of the Action of Assumpsit'', ([[Oxford University Press]]: Oxford, 1975).</ref>\n\n[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] systems take the approach that an exchange of promises, or a concurrence of wills alone, rather than an exchange in valuable rights is the correct basis. So if A promises to give B a book, and B accepts the offer without giving anything in return, B would have a legal right to the book and A could not change her mind about giving it to B as a gift. However, in [[common law system]]s the concept of ''[[culpa in contrahendo]]'', a form of [[estoppel]], is increasingly used to create obligations during [[pre-contractual negotiations]].<ref>''[[Austotel v Franklins]]'' (1989) 16 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 582</ref><ref name=\"Waltons HCA\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|7|1988|litigants=[[Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher]] |parallelcite=(1988) 164 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 387 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> Estoppel is an [[Equity (law)|equitable doctrine]] that provides for the creation of legal obligations if a party has given another an [[wikt:assurance|assurance]] and the other has relied on the assurance to his [[detriment (law)|detriment]].\n\n==Monetary value of consideration==\nGenerally, courts do not inquire whether the deal between two parties was monetarily fair&mdash;merely that each party passed some legal obligation or duty to the other party.<ref>''Thomas v Thomas'' (1842)</ref><ref name=\"Woollen Mills HCA\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|20|1954|litigants=Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth |parallelcite=(1954) 92 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 424 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> The dispositive issue is presence of consideration, not adequacy of the consideration. The values between consideration passed by each party to a contract need not be comparable.\n\nFor instance, if A offers B $200 to buy B's mansion, luxury sports car, and private jet, there is still consideration on both sides. A's consideration is $200, and B's consideration is the mansion, car, and jet. Courts in the United States generally leave parties to their own contracts, and do not intervene. The old English rule of consideration questioned whether a party gave the ''value of a [[peppercorn (legal)|peppercorn]]'' to the other party. As a result, contracts in the United States have sometimes have had one party pass nominal amounts of consideration, typically citing $1. Thus, licensing contracts that do not involve any money at all often cite as consideration, \"for the sum of $1 and other good and valuable consideration.\"\n\nHowever, some courts in the United States may take issue with nominal consideration, or consideration with virtually no value. Some courts have since thought this was a sham. Since contract disputes are typically resolved in state court, some state courts have found that merely providing $1 to another is not a sufficiently legal duty, and therefore no legal consideration passes in these kinds of deals, and consequently, no contract is formed. However, this is a minority position.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/historical/2004/dec/030109.htm |title=Supreme Court of Texas (1464-EIGHT, LTD. & MILLIS MANAGEMENT CORP, v.

On the nephew's 18th birthday, he tells the uncle to pay up, and the uncle does not pay.  In the subsequent lawsuit, the uncle wins, because the nephew, by U.S. criminal law, already had a duty to refrain from smoking cigarettes while under 18 or drink alcohol while under age 21.\n\nThe same applies if the consideration is a performance for which the parties had previously contracted. For example, A agrees to paint B's house for $500, but halfway through the job A tells B that he will not finish unless B increases the payment to $750. If B agrees, and A then finishes the job, B still only needs to pay A the $500 originally agreed to, because A was already contractually obligated to paint the house for that amount.\n\nAn exception to this rule holds for [[settlement (litigation)|settlement]]s, such as an [[accord and satisfaction]].  If a creditor has a credit against a debtor for $10,000, and offers to settle it for $5,000, it is still binding, if accepted, even though the debtor had a legal duty to repay the entire $10,000.\n\nPre-existing duties relating to [[at-will employment]] depend largely on state law.  Generally, [[at-will employment]] allows the employer to terminate the employee for good or even no reason, and allows the employee to resign for any reason.  There are no duties of continued employment in the future.  Therefore, when an employee demands a raise, there is no issue with consideration because the employee has no legal duty to continue working.  Similarly, when an employer demands a pay-cut, there is also no contractual issue with consideration, because the employer has no legal duty to continue employing the worker.  However, certain states require additional consideration other than the prospect of continued employment, to enforce terms demanded later by the employer, in particular, non-competition clauses.\n\n==Bundled terms==\nContracts where a legally valueless term is bundled with a term that does have legal value are still generally enforceable.\n\nConsider the uncle's situation above. If the same uncle had instead told his 13-year-old nephew the following offer: \"if you do not smoke cigarettes, do not drink alcohol, swear or play cards for money (gamble) before your 21st birthday, then I will pay you $5,000\".  On the nephew's 21st birthday, he asks the uncle to pay up, and this time, in the subsequent lawsuit, the nephew may win.<ref>[https://sourcelawfirm.com/2019/02/09/contract-law-hamer-v-sidway/ Hamer v Sidway |parallelcite=(1891) 124 NY 538]</ref> Although the promise of not drinking alcohol and gambling while under the age of 21 was not valuable consideration (it was already legally prohibited), most states allow smoking by age 18 and swearing, while some consider it vulgar, is not illegal at any age.  Even though smoking is legally restricted until age 18, it is legal for those above 18, and thus the promise to forbear from it entirely has legal value.  However, the uncle would still be relieved from the liability if his nephew drank alcohol, even though ''that'' consideration is valueless, because it was paired with something of legal value; therefore, adherence to the entire, collective agreement is necessary.\n\n==Past consideration==\nGenerally, past consideration is not a valid consideration and has no legal value. Past consideration is consideration that has already flowed from the promisee to the promisor. That is, the promisee's act or forbearance predates the promisor's promise. Past consideration therefore cannot be used as a basis when claiming damages.<ref>see {{cite BAILII|court= EWHC |num=J74 |year=1842 |litigants=Roscorla v Thomas |parallelcite=(1842) 114 ER 496}}.</ref>\n\nAn exception to this rule is where there is a duty owed to a third party. \tAn act done before the giving of a promise to make a payment or to confer some other benefit can sometimes be consideration for the promise. For this to hold, three conditions must be satisfied (Pao On v Lau Yiu Long [1980]):\n\n# The act must have been done at the promisor\u2019s request\n# The parties must have understood the act was to be remunerated either by a payment or the conferment of some other benefit \n# Payment/conferment of the benefit must have been legally enforceable had it been promised in advance\n\n==Option contracts and conditional consideration==\nGenerally, conditional consideration is valid consideration.\n\nSuppose A is a movie script writer and B runs a movie production company.  A says to B, \"buy my script.\" B says \"How about this \u2013 I will pay you $5,000 so that you do not let anyone else produce your movie until one year from now.  If I do produce your movie in that year, then I will give you another $50,000, and no one else can produce it.  If I do not produce your movie in that year, then you're free to go.\"  If the two subsequently get into a dispute, the issue of whether a contract exists is answered.  B had an option contract\u2014he could decide to produce the script, or not. B's consideration passed was the $5,000 down, and the possibility of $50,000.  A's consideration passed was the exclusive rights to the movie script for at least one year.\n\n==In settlements==\n\nSuppose B commits a [[tort]] against A, causing $5,000 in [[compensatory damages]] and $3,000 in [[punitive damages]].  Since there is no guarantee that A would win against B if it went to court, A may agree to drop the case if B pays the $5,000 compensatory damages.  This is sufficient consideration, since B's consideration is a guaranteed recovery, and A's consideration is that B only has to pay $5,000, instead of $8,000.\n\n==Treatments by different legal systems==\n\n*[[Consideration under English law]]\n*[[Consideration under American law]]\n* Consideration is not required for a contract under [[Scots contract law]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs = Calamari, John D.; Perillo, Joseph M.

The concept has been adopted by other common law jurisdictions, including the US.\n\nThe court in ''Currie v Misa'' <ref>''Currie v Misa''  (1875)  LR 10 Ex 893</ref> declared consideration to be a \u201cRight,  Interest,  Profit,  Benefit, or Forbearance,  Detriment,  Loss,  Responsibility\u201d. Thus, consideration is a promise of something of value given by a promissor in exchange for something of value given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable '''only''' if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.<ref>''Wade v Simeon'' (1846)  2 CB 548</ref><ref>''White v Bluett''  (1853)  2 WR 75</ref><ref>Bronaugh R. (1976). [http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2434&context=wmlr Agreement, Mistake, and Objectivity in the Bargain Theory of Conflict]. ''William & Mary Law Review''.</ref>\n\nConsideration may be thought of as the concept of value offered and accepted by people or organisations entering into [[contract]]s. Anything of value promised by one party to the other when making a contract can be treated as \"consideration\": for example, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $5,000, A's consideration is the $5,000, and B's consideration is the car.\n\nAdditionally, if A signs a contract with B such that A will paint B's house for $500, A's consideration is the service of painting B's house, and B's consideration is $500 paid to A. Further, if A signs a contract with B such that A will ''not'' repaint his own house in any other color than white, and B will pay A $500 per year to keep this deal up, there is also consideration. Although A did not promise to affirmatively do anything, A did promise ''not'' to do something that he was allowed to do, and so A did pass consideration. A's consideration to B is the ''forbearance'' in painting his own house in a color other than white, and B's consideration to A is $500 per year. Conversely, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $0, B's consideration is still the car, but A is giving no consideration, and so there is no valid contract. However, if B still gives the title to the car to A, then B cannot take the car back, since, while it may not be a valid contract, it ''is'' a valid [[Gift (law)|gift]].\n\nIn [[common law]] it is a prerequisite that both parties offer consideration before a contract can be thought of as binding. The doctrine of consideration is irrelevant in many jurisdictions, although contemporary commercial litigant relations have held the relationship between a promise and a deed is a reflection of the nature of contractual considerations. If there is no element of consideration found, there is thus no contract formed.\n\nHowever, even if a court decides there is no contract, there might be a possible recovery under the doctrines of ''[[quantum meruit]]'' (sometimes referred to as a [[quasi-contract]]) or [[Estoppel#Promissory estoppel|promissory estoppel]].\n\n==Legal rules regarding consideration==\nThere are a number of common issues as to whether consideration exists in a contract:\n# Part payment is not good consideration <ref> ''[[Pinnel's Case]]'' (1602)  5 Co Rep 117a</ref><ref> ''[[Jorden v Money]]'' (1854) 5 HLC 185</ref><ref> ''[[Foakes v Beer]]''  ''([[per incuriam]]?)''

Atiyah, 'Consideration: A Restatement' in ''Essays on Contract'' (1986) p.195, Oxford University Press</ref> However, [[legislation]], rather than judicial development, has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine. [[Lord Denning|Lord Justice Denning]] famously stated that \"The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind\".<ref>[[Central London Property Trust Ltd. v. High Trees House Ltd.]] [1947] KB 130</ref>\n\nThe reason that both exist in common law jurisdictions is thought by leading scholars to be the result of the combining by 19th century judges of two distinct threads: first the consideration requirement was at the heart of the action of [[assumpsit]], which had grown up in medieval times and remained the normal action for breach of a simple contract in England and Wales until 1884, when the old forms of action were abolished; secondly, the notion of agreement between two or more parties as being the essential legal and moral foundation of contract in all legal systems, was promoted by the 18th century French writer Pothier in his ''Traite des Obligations'', much read (especially after translation into English in 1805) by English judges and jurists. The latter chimed well with the fashionable will theories of the time, especially [[John Stuart Mill]]'s influential ideas on free will, and got grafted on to the traditional common law requirement for consideration to ground an action in assumpsit.<ref>For a detailed and authoritative account of this process, see [[A. W. B. Simpson]], ''A History of the Common Law of Contract: The Rise of the Action of Assumpsit'', ([[Oxford University Press]]: Oxford, 1975).</ref>\n\n[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] systems take the approach that an exchange of promises, or a concurrence of wills alone, rather than an exchange in valuable rights is the correct basis. So if A promises to give B a book, and B accepts the offer without giving anything in return, B would have a legal right to the book and A could not change her mind about giving it to B as a gift. However, in [[common law system]]s the concept of ''[[culpa in contrahendo]]'', a form of [[estoppel]], is increasingly used to create obligations during [[pre-contractual negotiations]].<ref>''[[Austotel v Franklins]]'' (1989) 16 [[NSW Law Reports|NSWLR]] 582</ref><ref name=\"Waltons HCA\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|7|1988|litigants=[[Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher]] |parallelcite=(1988) 164 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 387 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> Estoppel is an [[Equity (law)|equitable doctrine]] that provides for the creation of legal obligations if a party has given another an [[wikt:assurance|assurance]] and the other has relied on the assurance to his [[detriment (law)|detriment]].\n\n==Monetary value of consideration==\nGenerally, courts do not inquire whether the deal between two parties was monetarily fair&mdash;merely that each party passed some legal obligation or duty to the other party.<ref>''Thomas v Thomas'' (1842)</ref><ref name=\"Woollen Mills HCA\">{{cite AustLII|HCA|20|1954|litigants=Australian Woollen Mills Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth |parallelcite=(1954) 92 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 424 |courtname=auto}}.</ref> The dispositive issue is presence of consideration, not adequacy of the consideration. The values between consideration passed by each party to a contract need not be comparable.\n\nFor instance, if A offers B $200 to buy B's mansion, luxury sports car, and private jet, there is still consideration on both sides. A's consideration is $200, and B's consideration is the mansion, car, and jet. Courts in the United States generally leave parties to their own contracts, and do not intervene. The old English rule of consideration questioned whether a party gave the ''value of a [[peppercorn (legal)|peppercorn]]'' to the other party. As a result, contracts in the United States have sometimes have had one party pass nominal amounts of consideration, typically citing $1. Thus, licensing contracts that do not involve any money at all often cite as consideration, \"for the sum of $1 and other good and valuable consideration.\"\n\nHowever, some courts in the United States may take issue with nominal consideration, or consideration with virtually no value. Some courts have since thought this was a sham. Since contract disputes are typically resolved in state court, some state courts have found that merely providing $1 to another is not a sufficiently legal duty, and therefore no legal consideration passes in these kinds of deals, and consequently, no contract is formed. However, this is a minority position.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/historical/2004/dec/030109.htm |title=Supreme Court of Texas (1464-EIGHT, LTD. & MILLIS MANAGEMENT CORP, v.

On the nephew's 18th birthday, he tells the uncle to pay up, and the uncle does not pay.  In the subsequent lawsuit, the uncle wins, because the nephew, by U.S. criminal law, already had a duty to refrain from smoking cigarettes while under 18 or drink alcohol while under age 21.\n\nThe same applies if the consideration is a performance for which the parties had previously contracted. For example, A agrees to paint B's house for $500, but halfway through the job A tells B that he will not finish unless B increases the payment to $750. If B agrees, and A then finishes the job, B still only needs to pay A the $500 originally agreed to, because A was already contractually obligated to paint the house for that amount.\n\nAn exception to this rule holds for [[settlement (litigation)|settlement]]s, such as an [[accord and satisfaction]].  If a creditor has a credit against a debtor for $10,000, and offers to settle it for $5,000, it is still binding, if accepted, even though the debtor had a legal duty to repay the entire $10,000.\n\nPre-existing duties relating to [[at-will employment]] depend largely on state law.  Generally, [[at-will employment]] allows the employer to terminate the employee for good or even no reason, and allows the employee to resign for any reason.  There are no duties of continued employment in the future.  Therefore, when an employee demands a raise, there is no issue with consideration because the employee has no legal duty to continue working.  Similarly, when an employer demands a pay-cut, there is also no contractual issue with consideration, because the employer has no legal duty to continue employing the worker.  However, certain states require additional consideration other than the prospect of continued employment, to enforce terms demanded later by the employer, in particular, non-competition clauses.\n\n==Bundled terms==\nContracts where a legally valueless term is bundled with a term that does have legal value are still generally enforceable.\n\nConsider the uncle's situation above. If the same uncle had instead told his 13-year-old nephew the following offer: \"if you do not smoke cigarettes, do not drink alcohol, swear or play cards for money (gamble) before your 21st birthday, then I will pay you $5,000\".  On the nephew's 21st birthday, he asks the uncle to pay up, and this time, in the subsequent lawsuit, the nephew may win.<ref>[https://sourcelawfirm.com/2019/02/09/contract-law-hamer-v-sidway/ Hamer v Sidway |parallelcite=(1891) 124 NY 538]</ref> Although the promise of not drinking alcohol and gambling while under the age of 21 was not valuable consideration (it was already legally prohibited), most states allow smoking by age 18 and swearing, while some consider it vulgar, is not illegal at any age.  Even though smoking is legally restricted until age 18, it is legal for those above 18, and thus the promise to forbear from it entirely has legal value.  However, the uncle would still be relieved from the liability if his nephew drank alcohol, even though ''that'' consideration is valueless, because it was paired with something of legal value; therefore, adherence to the entire, collective agreement is necessary.\n\n==Past consideration==\nGenerally, past consideration is not a valid consideration and has no legal value. Past consideration is consideration that has already flowed from the promisee to the promisor. That is, the promisee's act or forbearance predates the promisor's promise. Past consideration therefore cannot be used as a basis when claiming damages.<ref>see {{cite BAILII|court= EWHC |num=J74 |year=1842 |litigants=Roscorla v Thomas |parallelcite=(1842) 114 ER 496}}.</ref>\n\nAn exception to this rule is where there is a duty owed to a third party. \tAn act done before the giving of a promise to make a payment or to confer some other benefit can sometimes be consideration for the promise. For this to hold, three conditions must be satisfied (Pao On v Lau Yiu Long [1980]):\n\n# The act must have been done at the promisor\u2019s request\n# The parties must have understood the act was to be remunerated either by a payment or the conferment of some other benefit \n# Payment/conferment of the benefit must have been legally enforceable had it been promised in advance\n\n==Option contracts and conditional consideration==\nGenerally, conditional consideration is valid consideration.\n\nSuppose A is a movie script writer and B runs a movie production company.  A says to B, \"buy my script.\" B says \"How about this \u2013 I will pay you $5,000 so that you do not let anyone else produce your movie until one year from now.  If I do produce your movie in that year, then I will give you another $50,000, and no one else can produce it.  If I do not produce your movie in that year, then you're free to go.\"  If the two subsequently get into a dispute, the issue of whether a contract exists is answered.  B had an option contract\u2014he could decide to produce the script, or not. B's consideration passed was the $5,000 down, and the possibility of $50,000.  A's consideration passed was the exclusive rights to the movie script for at least one year.\n\n==In settlements==\n\nSuppose B commits a [[tort]] against A, causing $5,000 in [[compensatory damages]] and $3,000 in [[punitive damages]].  Since there is no guarantee that A would win against B if it went to court, A may agree to drop the case if B pays the $5,000 compensatory damages.  This is sufficient consideration, since B's consideration is a guaranteed recovery, and A's consideration is that B only has to pay $5,000, instead of $8,000.\n\n==Treatments by different legal systems==\n\n*[[Consideration under English law]]\n*[[Consideration under American law]]\n* Consideration is not required for a contract under [[Scots contract law]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs = Calamari, John D.; Perillo, Joseph M.

Nuns are most common in [[Mahayana Buddhism]], but have more recently become more prevalent in other traditions.\n\nWithin Christianity, women religious, known as nuns or '''religious sisters''', are found in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Anglican]], and [[Lutheran]] traditions among others. Though the terms are often used interchangeably, ''nuns'' historically take solemn vows and live a life of prayer and contemplation in a [[monastery]] or [[convent]], while ''[[Religious sister|sister]]s'' take simple vows<ref name=mw_sister>{{cite dictionary|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sister|title=Sister|dictionary=Merriam-Webster|quote=[A] member of a women's religious order (as of nuns or deaconesses); especially : one of a Roman Catholic congregation under simple vows }}</ref> and live an active vocation of prayer and charitable works in areas such as education and healthcare.

The Buddha is reported to have allowed women into the ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' only with great reluctance, predicting that the move would lead to Buddhism's collapse after 500 years, rather than the 1,000 years it would have enjoyed otherwise. (This prophecy occurs only once in the Canon and is the only prophecy involving time in the Canon, leading some to suspect that it is a late addition.)<ref>Hellmuth Hecker, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/hecker/wheel273.html#n-30].</ref> Fully ordained Buddhist nuns (''[[bhikkhuni]]s'') have more ''[[Patimokkha]]'' rules than the monks (''[[bhikkhu]]s''). The important vows are the same, however.\n\nAs with monks, there is quite a lot of variation in nuns' dress and social conventions between Buddhist cultures in Asia. Chinese nuns possess the full ''bhikkuni'' ordination, Tibetan nuns do not. In [[Theravada]] countries it is generally believed that the full ordination lineage of ''bhikkunis'' died out, though in many places they wear the \"saffron\" colored robes, observing only ten precepts like novices.\n\n=== Thailand ===\nIn [[Thailand]], a country which never had a tradition of fully ordained nuns (''bhikkhuni''), there developed a separate order of non-ordained female renunciates called ''[[mae ji]]''. However, some of them have played an important role in dhamma-practitioners' community.

Researcher Charles Brewer Jones estimates that from 1952 to 1999, when the Buddhist Association of the ROC organized public ordination, female applicants outnumbered males by about three to one. He adds:\n\n:\"All my informants in the areas of Taipei and Sanhsia considered nuns at least as respectable as monks, or even more so. [...] In contrast, however, Shiu-kuen Tsung found in Taipei county that female clergy were viewed with some suspicion by society. She reports that while outsiders did not necessarily regard their vocation as unworthy of respect, they still tended to view the nuns as social misfits.\"<ref>Charles Brewer Jones, ''Buddhism in Taiwan: Religion and the State, 1660\u20131990''; University of Hawaii Press, 1999; pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nWei-yi Cheng studied the Luminary (Hsiang Kuang \u9999\u5149) order in southern Taiwan. Cheng reviewed earlier studies which suggest that Taiwan's [[Zhaijiao]] tradition has a history of more female participation, and that the economic growth and loosening of family restriction have allowed more women to become nuns. Based on studies of the Luminary order, Cheng concluded that the monastic order in Taiwan was still young and gave nuns more room for development, and more mobile believers helped the order.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|author=Cheng, Wei-yi\n|title=Luminary Buddhist Nuns in Contemporary Taiwan: A Quiet Feminist Movement\n|journal=Journal of Buddhist Ethics\n|issue=V. 10 (2003)\n|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BE/jbe105259.htm\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Tibet ===\nThe August 2007 [[International Congress on Buddhist Women's Role in the Sangha]], with the support of H. H. [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|XIVth Dalai Lama]], reinstated the [[Gelongma]] ([[Dharmaguptaka]] [[vinaya]] bhikkhuni) lineage, having been lost, in India and Tibet, for centuries. Gelongma ordination requires the presence of ten fully ordained people keeping exactly the same vows. Because ten nuns are required to ordain a new one, the effort to establish the Dharmaguptaka bhikkhu tradition has taken a long time.\n\nIt is permissible for a Tibetan nun to receive bhikkhuni ordination from another living tradition, e.g., in [[Vietnam]]. Based on this, Western nuns ordained in Tibetan tradition, like [[Thubten Chodron]], took full ordination in another tradition.\n\nThe ordination of monks and nuns in Tibetan Buddhism distinguishes three stages: rabjung-ma, getsh\u00fcl-ma and gelong-ma. The clothes of the nuns in Tibet are basically the same as those of monks, but there are differences between novice and ''gelong'' robes.\n\n===Japan===\n[[Hokke-ji]] in 747 was established by the consort of the Emperor. It took charge of provincial convents, performed ceremonies for the protection of the state, and became the site of pilgrimages. Aristocratic Japanese women often became Buddhist nuns in the premodern period.  Originally it was thought they could not gain salvation because of the [[Five Hindrances]], which said women could not attain Buddhahood until they changed into men.  However, in 1249, 12 women received full ordination as priests.<ref>Lori Meeks, '' Hokkeji and the Reemergence of Female Monastic Orders in Premodern Japan'' (2010)  [https://www.amazon.com/Hokkeji-Reemergence-Monastic-Premodern-Buddhism/dp/0824833945/  excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\n== Christianity ==\n=== Roman Catholicism ===\n[[File:Andrea Mantegna 019.jpg|left|thumb|St. [[Scholastica]], sister of [[St. Benedict]] and foundress of the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] nuns]]\n[[File:Hildegard of bingen and nuns.jpg|thumb|[[Hildegard of Bingen]] and her nuns]]\n[[File:Maria Johanna von Zweyer c1800.jpg|thumb|Maria Johanna Baptista von Zweyer, Abbess of the Cistercian abbey of Wald]]\n[[File:Armand Gautier - Three Nuns in the Portal of a Church - Walters 371383.jpg|thumb|''Three [[Sisters of Mercy]] in the Portal of a Church'', by [[Armand Gautier]]]]\n\nIn the Roman Catholic tradition, there are a large number of [[religious institute]]s of nuns and sisters (the female equivalent of male [[monk]]s or [[friar]]s), each with its own [[charism]] or special character. Traditionally, nuns are members of [[enclosed religious orders]] and take solemn [[religious vows]], while sisters do not live in the papal enclosure and formerly took vows called \"simple vows\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://anunslife.org/how-to-become-a-nun/sister-or-nun|title=What is the difference between a sister and a nun?|website=anunslife.org|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>\n\nAs [[monastic]]s, nuns living within an enclosure historically commit to recitation of the full [[Liturgy of the Hours]] throughout the day in church, usually in a solemn manner. They were formerly distinguished within the monastic community as \"choir nuns\", as opposed to [[lay brothers#Lay sisters|lay sisters]] who performed upkeep of the monastery or errands outside the cloister. This last task is still often entrusted to women, called \"externs\", who live in the monastery, but outside the enclosure. They were usually either [[oblate]]s or members of the associated [[Third Order]], often wearing a different habit or the standard woman's attire of the period.\n\n====Membership and vows====\nIn general, when a woman enters a [[religious order]] or [[monastery]], she first undergoes a period of testing the life for six months to two years called a postulancy. If she, and the order, determine that she may have a [[vocation]] to the life, she receives the [[Religious habit|habit]] of the order (usually with some modification, normally a white veil instead of black, to distinguish her from [[Profession (religious)|professed]] members) and undertakes the [[novitiate]], a period (that lasts one to two years) of living the life of the religious institute without yet taking [[vows]].<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P25.HTM Canon 648], CIC 1983</ref> Upon completion of this period she may take her initial, temporary vows.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P26.HTM Canon 656], CIC 1983</ref> [[Temporary vows]] last one to three years, typically, and will be professed for not less than three years and not more than six.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P26.HTM Canon 655], CIC 1983</ref> Finally, she will petition to make her \"perpetual profession\", taking permanent, [[solemn vow]]s.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P26.HTM Canon 657], CIC 1983</ref>\n\nIn the branches of the [[Benedictine]] tradition, (Benedictines, [[Cistercian]]s, [[Camaldolese]], and [[Trappist]]s, among others) nuns take vows of stability (that is, to remain a member of a single monastic community), obedience (to an [[abbess]] or [[prioress]]), and conversion of life (which includes poverty and celibacy). In other traditions, such as the [[Poor Clares]] (the [[Franciscan]] Order) and the [[Dominican Order|Dominican nuns]], they take the threefold vows of [[poverty]], [[chastity]] and [[vow of obedience|obedience]]. These are known as the \u2018evangelical counsels\u2019 as opposed to \u2018monastic vows\u2019 proper. Most orders of nuns not listed here follow one of these two patterns, with some Orders taking an additional vow related to the specific work or character of their Order (for example, to undertake a certain style of devotion, praying for a specific intention or purpose).<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[File:Bridgettine-nuns.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bridgettines|Bridgettine Sisters]] at the [[March For Life in Washington, D.C.]], January 2009]]\n[[File:MotherTeresa 094.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mother Teresa]], founder of the [[Missionaries of Charity]]<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/mother-teresa-who-becomes-a-saint-on-sunday-began-her-life-as-a-nun-in-dublin-1.2777022|title=Mother Teresa, who becomes a saint on Sunday, began her life as a nun in Dublin|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nun-in-iconic-italy-earthquake-photo-shares-her-story-of-survival/|title=Nun in iconic Italy quake photo shares her story of survival|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en}}</ref>]]\n\nCloistered nuns ([[Carmelites]], for example) observe \"papal enclosure\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P28.HTM Canon 667] \u00a73, CIC 1983, SCRIS instruction, \"Venite seorsum\" August 15, 1969, in AAS 61 (1969) 674\u2013690</ref> rules, and their nunneries typically have walls separating the nuns from the outside world. The nuns rarely leave (except for medical necessity or occasionally for purposes related to their contemplative life) though they may receive visitors in specially built parlors, often with either a grille or half-wall separating the nuns from visitors. They are usually self-sufficient, earning money by selling jams, candies or baked goods by mail order, or by making liturgical items (such as vestments, candles, or hosts to be consecrated at Mass for Holy Communion).\n\nThey often undertake contemplative ministries \u2013 that is, a community of nuns is often associated with prayer for some particular good or supporting the missions of another order by prayer (for instance, the Dominican nuns of [[Corpus Christi Monastery]] in [[the Bronx]], New York, pray in support of the priests of the [[Archdiocese of New York]]). Yet religious sisters can also perform this form of ministry, e.g., the [[Maryknoll]] Missionary Sisters have small houses of [[contemplative]] sisters, some in mission locations, who pray for the work of the priests, brothers and other sisters of their congregation, and since Vatican II have added retreat work and spiritual guidance to their apostoloate;<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.maryknollsisters.org/sisters/sister-grace-corde-myerjack/|title=Sister Grace Corde Myerjack \u2013 Maryknoll Sisters|work=Maryknoll Sisters|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-US}}</ref> the [[Sister Disciples of the Divine Master]] are also cloistered sisters who receive visitors and pray in support of their sister congregation,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pddm.us/p.promise94.php|title=Vocation: Sister Disciples Of The Divine Master|website=www.pddm.us|access-date=2018-05-24}}</ref> the [[Daughters of St. Paul]] in their media ministry.\n\n====Leadership====\nA [[canoness]] is a nun who corresponds to the male equivalent of [[Canon (priest)|canon]], usually following the Rule of S. Augustine. The origin and rules of monastic life are common to both. As with the canons, differences in the observance of rule gave rise to two types: the [[canoness regular]], taking the traditional religious vows, and the secular canoness, who did not take vows and thus remained free to own property and leave to marry, should they choose. This was primarily a way of leading a pious life for the women of aristocratic families and generally disappeared in the modern age, except for the modern [[Stift#Stift as endowment for unmarried Protestant women|Lutheran convents]] of Germany.\n\nA nun who is elected to head her religious house is termed an [[abbess]] if the house is an abbey, a prioress if it is a monastery, or more generically may be referred to as \"Mother Superior\" and styled \"Reverend Mother\". The distinction between abbey and monastery has to do with the terms used by a particular order or by the level of independence of the religious house. Technically, a [[convent]] is any home of a community of sisters \u2013 or, indeed, of priests and brothers, though this term is rarely used in the United States. The term \"monastery\" is often used by The Benedictine family to speak of the buildings and \"convent\" when referring to the community. Neither is gender specific. \u2018Convent\u2019 is often used of the houses of certain other institutes.\n\nThe traditional dress for women in religious communities consists of a [[tunic]], which is tied around the waist with a cloth or leather belt. Over the tunic some nuns wear a [[scapular]] which is a garment of long wide piece of woolen cloth worn over the shoulders with an opening for the head. Some wear a white [[wimple]] and a veil, the most significant and ancient aspect of the habit. Some Orders \u2013 such as the Dominicans \u2013 wear a large rosary on their belt. Benedictine abbesses wear a cross or crucifix on a chain around their neck.\n\nAfter the [[Second Vatican Council]], many religious institutes chose in their own regulations to no longer wear the traditional habit and did away with choosing a [[religious name]]. [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church canon law]] states: \"Religious are to wear the habit of the institute, made according to the norm of proper law, as a sign of their consecration and as a witness of poverty.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P28.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law \u2013 IntraText|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2018-02-14}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2019, clerical abuse of nuns, including [[sexual slavery]], by [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Catholic priests]] has been acknowledged by the [[Pope]].<ref name=\"BBC-20190206\">{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Pope admits clerical abuse of nuns including sexual slavery |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47134033 |date=February 6, 2019 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=February 9, 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20190205\">{{cite news |author=The Associated Press |title=Pope Publicly Acknowledges Clergy Sexual Abuse of Nuns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/02/05/world/europe/ap-eu-rel-vatican-nun-abuse-.html |date=February 5, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 9, 2019 |author-link=The Associated Press }}</ref>\n\n==== Distinction between a nun and a religious sister ====\n{{See also|Religious sister (Catholic)}}\n[[File:Irm\u00e3 Ros\u00e1lia Sehnem IFPCC7.JPG|left|thumb|Sister Ros\u00e1lia Sehnem of the [[Sisters of St. Francis of Penance and Christian Charity]]]]\n\nAlthough usage has varied throughout church history, typically \"nun\" (Latin: ''monialis'') is used for women who have taken solemn vows, and \"sister\" (Latin: ''soror'') is used for women who have taken simple vows.\n\nDuring the first millennium, nearly all religious communities of men and women were dedicated to prayer and [[contemplative prayer|contemplation]]. These [[monasteries]] were built in remote locations or were separated from the world by means of a [[precinct wall]].

There were very few rich [[American Catholics]], and no aristocrats.

The numbers grew rapidly, from 900 sisters in 15 communities in 1840, 50,000 in 170 orders in 1900, and 135,000 in 300 different orders by 1930.

Outside the home, Canadian women had few domains which they controlled. An important exception came with Roman Catholic nuns, especially in Qu\u00e9bec. Stimulated by the influence in France, the popular religiosity of the [[Counter Reformation]], new orders for women began appearing in the seventeenth century. In the next three centuries women opened dozens of independent religious orders, funded in part by [[Religious dower|dowries]] provided by the parents of young nuns. The orders specialized in charitable works, including hospitals, orphanages, [[maternity home|homes for unwed mothers]], and schools.<ref>Thomas Carr, Jr., \"Writing the Convent in New France: The Colonialist Rhetoric of Canadian Nuns\", ''Quebec Studies'' (2009), Issue 47, pp 3\u201323.</ref>\n\n'''Early Modern Spain'''\n\nPrior to women becoming nuns during early modern Spain, aspired nuns underwent a process.

In [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and other Eastern European languages, both domiciles are called \"monasteries\" and the ascetics who live therein are \"monastics\". In English, however, it is acceptable to use the terms \"nun\" and \"convent\" for clarity and convenience. The term for an abbess is the feminine form of abbot (''[[hegumen]]'') \u2013 Greek: ''hegumeni''; {{lang-sr|\u0418\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430 }}(''Igumanija''); Russian: \u0438\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, (''[[igumenia]]''). Orthodox monastics do not have distinct \"orders\" as in Western Christianity. Orthodox monks and nuns lead identical spiritual lives.<ref>Archpriest Seraphim Slobodskoy, ''The Law of God'' (Printshop of St. Job of Pochaev, Jordanville, NY, {{ISBN|0884650448}}), p. 618.</ref> There may be slight differences in the way a monastery functions internally but these are simply differences in style (Gr. ''[[typica]]'') dependent on the abbess or [[abbot]]. The abbess is the spiritual leader of the convent and her authority is absolute (no [[priest]], [[bishop]], or even [[patriarch]] can override an abbess within the walls of her monastery.) There has always been spiritual equality between men and women in the Orthodox Church ({{bibleverse||Galatians|3:28|KJV}}). Abbots and Abbesses rank in authority equal to bishops in many ways and were included in [[ecumenical council]]s. Orthodox monasteries are usually associated with a local synod of bishops by jurisdiction, but are otherwise self-governing. Abbesses hear [[Confession (religion)|confession]]s (but do not [[absolution|absolve]]) and dispense [[blessing]]s on their charges, though they still require the services of a [[presbyter]] (i.e., a priest) to celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]] and perform other priestly functions, such as the absolution of a penitent.\n\nOrthodox monastics, in general have little or no contact with the outside world, especially family. The pious family whose child decides to enter the monastic profession understands that their child will become \"dead to the world\" and therefore be unavailable for social visits.\n\nThere are a number of different levels that the nun passes through in her profession:\n{{Main|Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism}}\n\n*'''Novice \u2013''' When one enters a monastery the first three to five years are spent as a [[novitiate|novice]]. Novices may or may not (depending on the abbess's wishes) dress in the black inner robe ([[cassock|Isorassa]]); those who do will also usually wear the [[apostolnik]] or a black [[scarf]] tied over the head (see photo, above). The isorassa is the first part of the monastic \"[[Religious habit|habit]]\" of which there is only one style for Orthodox monastics (this is true in general, there have been a few slight regional variations over the centuries, but the style always seems to precipitate back to a style common in the 3rd or 4th century). If a novice chooses to leave during the novitiate period no penalty is incurred.\n*'''Rassaphore \u2013''' When the abbess deems the novice ready, the novice is asked to join the monastery. If she accepts, she is [[tonsure]]d in a formal service during which she is given the outer robe ([[Cassock|Exorassa]]) and veil ([[Epanokamelavkion]]) to wear, and (because she is now dead to the world) receives a new name. Nuns consider themselves part of a sisterhood; however, tonsured nuns are usually addressed as \"Mother\" (in some convents, the title of \"Mother\" is reserved to those who enter into the next level of Stavrophore).\n*'''Stavrophore \u2013''' The next level for monastics takes place some years after the first tonsure when the abbess feels the nun has reached a level of discipline, dedication, and [[humility]]. Once again, in a formal service the nun is elevated to the \"Little Schema\" which is signified by additions to her habit of certain symbolic articles of clothing. In addition, the abbess increases the nun's [[prayer rule]], she is allowed a stricter personal ascetic practice.\n*'''Great Schema \u2013''' The final stage, called \"Megaloschemos\" or \"[[Great Schema]]\" is reached by nuns whose Abbess feels they have reached a high level of excellence. In some monastic traditions the Great Schema is only given to monks and nuns on their death bed, while in others they may be elevated after as little as 25 years of service.\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|[[File:Nevrev-Princess.jpg|thumb|''Princess Praskovya Yusupova before becoming a nun'' [[Nikolai Nevrev]], 1886]]\n|[[File:Nun flowers black white.JPG|thumb|''The Way of Humility'': [[Russian Orthodox]] nun working at [[Ein Karem]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n|}\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Protestantism ===\n[[Image:Monastery Ebstorf.jpg|thumb|[[Ebstorf Abbey]] continued as a Lutheran convent in the Benedictine tradition since 1529.]]\nAfter the Protestant Reformation, some monasteries in Lutheran lands (such as [[Amelungsborn Abbey]] near [[Negenborn]] and [[Loccum Abbey]] in [[Rehburg-Loccum]]) and convents (such as [[Ebstorf Abbey]] near the town of [[Uelzen]] and [[Bursfelde Abbey]] in [[Bursfelde]]) adopted the Lutheran Christian faith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medievalhistories.com/kloster-ebstorf-convent-bad-bevensen-near-luneburg/|title=Kloster Ebstorf|date=8 August 2014|publisher=Medieval Histories|language=English|accessdate=20 November 2017|quote=The monastery is mentioned for the first time in 1197.

Monasteries and convents were deprived of their lands and possessions, and monastics were forced to either live a secular life on a pension or flee the country.  Many Roman Catholic nuns went to France.\n\n[[File:Julianofnorwich.jpg|thumb|Two Anglican nuns]]\nAnglican religious orders are organizations of [[laity]] or clergy in the [[Anglican Communion]] who live under a common rule. The term \"religious orders\" is distinguished from [[Holy Orders]] (the sacrament of [[ordination]] which bishops, priests, and deacons receive), though many communities do have ordained members.\n\nThe structure and function of religious orders in Anglicanism roughly parallels that which exists in Roman Catholicism. Religious communities are divided into orders proper, in which members take solemn vows and congregations, whose members take simple vows.\n\nWith the rise of the [[Oxford Movement]] in Anglicanism in the early 19th century came interest in the revival of \"religious life\" in England. Between 1841 and 1855, several religious orders for nuns were founded, among them the Community of St. Mary at [[Wantage]] and the Community of St. Margaret at [[East Grinstead]].\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the founding of Anglican religious orders of nuns began in 1845 with the Sisterhood of the Holy Communion (now defunct) in New York.\n\nWhilst there is no single central authority for all religious orders, and many member churches of the Anglican Communion have their own internal structures for recognising and regulating religious orders, some central functions are performed by the Anglican Religious Communities Department at [[Church House, Westminster]], the headquarters of the Church of England's [[Church Commissioners]], [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]], [[Archbishops' Council]], and [[National Society for Promoting Religious Education|National Society]]. This department publishes the bi-annual ''Anglican Religious Life'', a world directory of religious orders, and also maintains an official Anglican Communion website for religious orders. ''Anglican Religious Life'' defines four categories of community.<ref>Anglican Religious Life 2012\u201313, published Canterbury Press, Norwich, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-84825-089-5}}, pp. iii, iv, 19, 147, 151, 171.</ref>\n* \"Traditional celibate religious orders and communities\": Members take a vow of celibacy (amongst other vows) and follow a common Rule of life. They may be enclosed and contemplative or open and engaged in apostolic works.\n* \"Dispersed communities\": These are orders or communities whose members, whilst taking vows (including celibacy), do not live together in community. In most cases the members are self-supporting and live alone, but follow the same Rule of life, and meet together frequently in assemblies often known as 'Chapter meetings'. In some cases some members may share a common life in very small groups of two or three.\n* \"Acknowledged communities\": These communities live a traditional Christian life, including the taking of vows, but the traditional vows are adapted or changed. In many cases these communities admit both single and married persons as members, requiring celibacy on the part of those who are single, and unfailing commitment to their spouse on the part of married members. They also amend the vow of poverty, allowing personal possessions, but requiring high standards of tithing to the community and the wider church. These communities often have residential elements, but not full residential community life, as this would be incompatible with some elements of married family life.\n* \"Other communities\": This group contains communities that are ecumenical (including Anglicans) or that belong to non-Anglican churches that have entered into relationships of full communion with the Anglican Church (particularly, but not only, certain Lutheran churches).\n\nIn the United States (only), there is a clear distinction between \"orders\" and \"communities\", as the Episcopal Church has its own two-fold definition of \"religious orders\" (equivalent to the first two groups above) and \"Christian communities\" (equivalent to the third group above).<ref>See Title III, Canon 24, sections 1 and 2 of the Canons of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, also quoted at [http://communities.anglicancommunion.org Anglican Communion Religious Communities].</ref>  The ''Anglican Religious Life'' directory affirms this, stating \"This distinction in not used in other parts of the Anglican Communion where 'communities' is also used for those who take traditional vows.\"<ref>''Anglican Religious Life 2012\u201313'', Canterbury Press, Norwich, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-84825-089-5}}, p. 151.</ref>\n[[File:Kloster Bursfelde von NO.jpg|thumb|[[Bursfelde Abbey]] has continued as a Lutheran convent since A.D. 1579]]\n\nIn some Anglican orders, there are sisters who have been ordained and can celebrate the Eucharist.<ref>[http://www.ssmbos.com/Pages/whatwedo.html What We Do] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616160844/http://www.ssmbos.com/Pages/whatwedo.html |date=2010-06-16 }} sisters of St. Margaret, (Episcopal religious community of women)</ref>\n\n==== Lutheranism ====\nThere are a plethora of religious orders within the [[Lutheran Church]]es, such as the [[Order of Lutheran Franciscans]] and [[Daughters of Mary (Lutheran)|Daughters of Mary]].

The Buddha is reported to have allowed women into the ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' only with great reluctance, predicting that the move would lead to Buddhism's collapse after 500 years, rather than the 1,000 years it would have enjoyed otherwise. (This prophecy occurs only once in the Canon and is the only prophecy involving time in the Canon, leading some to suspect that it is a late addition.)<ref>Hellmuth Hecker, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/hecker/wheel273.html#n-30].</ref> Fully ordained Buddhist nuns (''[[bhikkhuni]]s'') have more ''[[Patimokkha]]'' rules than the monks (''[[bhikkhu]]s''). The important vows are the same, however.\n\nAs with monks, there is quite a lot of variation in nuns' dress and social conventions between Buddhist cultures in Asia. Chinese nuns possess the full ''bhikkuni'' ordination, Tibetan nuns do not. In [[Theravada]] countries it is generally believed that the full ordination lineage of ''bhikkunis'' died out, though in many places they wear the \"saffron\" colored robes, observing only ten precepts like novices.\n\n=== Thailand ===\nIn [[Thailand]], a country which never had a tradition of fully ordained nuns (''bhikkhuni''), there developed a separate order of non-ordained female renunciates called ''[[mae ji]]''. However, some of them have played an important role in dhamma-practitioners' community.

Researcher Charles Brewer Jones estimates that from 1952 to 1999, when the Buddhist Association of the ROC organized public ordination, female applicants outnumbered males by about three to one. He adds:\n\n:\"All my informants in the areas of Taipei and Sanhsia considered nuns at least as respectable as monks, or even more so. [...] In contrast, however, Shiu-kuen Tsung found in Taipei county that female clergy were viewed with some suspicion by society. She reports that while outsiders did not necessarily regard their vocation as unworthy of respect, they still tended to view the nuns as social misfits.\"<ref>Charles Brewer Jones, ''Buddhism in Taiwan: Religion and the State, 1660\u20131990''; University of Hawaii Press, 1999; pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nWei-yi Cheng studied the Luminary (Hsiang Kuang \u9999\u5149) order in southern Taiwan. Cheng reviewed earlier studies which suggest that Taiwan's [[Zhaijiao]] tradition has a history of more female participation, and that the economic growth and loosening of family restriction have allowed more women to become nuns. Based on studies of the Luminary order, Cheng concluded that the monastic order in Taiwan was still young and gave nuns more room for development, and more mobile believers helped the order.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|author=Cheng, Wei-yi\n|title=Luminary Buddhist Nuns in Contemporary Taiwan: A Quiet Feminist Movement\n|journal=Journal of Buddhist Ethics\n|issue=V. 10 (2003)\n|url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-BE/jbe105259.htm\n}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Tibet ===\nThe August 2007 [[International Congress on Buddhist Women's Role in the Sangha]], with the support of H. H. [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|XIVth Dalai Lama]], reinstated the [[Gelongma]] ([[Dharmaguptaka]] [[vinaya]] bhikkhuni) lineage, having been lost, in India and Tibet, for centuries. Gelongma ordination requires the presence of ten fully ordained people keeping exactly the same vows. Because ten nuns are required to ordain a new one, the effort to establish the Dharmaguptaka bhikkhu tradition has taken a long time.\n\nIt is permissible for a Tibetan nun to receive bhikkhuni ordination from another living tradition, e.g., in [[Vietnam]]. Based on this, Western nuns ordained in Tibetan tradition, like [[Thubten Chodron]], took full ordination in another tradition.\n\nThe ordination of monks and nuns in Tibetan Buddhism distinguishes three stages: rabjung-ma, getsh\u00fcl-ma and gelong-ma. The clothes of the nuns in Tibet are basically the same as those of monks, but there are differences between novice and ''gelong'' robes.\n\n===Japan===\n[[Hokke-ji]] in 747 was established by the consort of the Emperor. It took charge of provincial convents, performed ceremonies for the protection of the state, and became the site of pilgrimages. Aristocratic Japanese women often became Buddhist nuns in the premodern period.  Originally it was thought they could not gain salvation because of the [[Five Hindrances]], which said women could not attain Buddhahood until they changed into men.  However, in 1249, 12 women received full ordination as priests.<ref>Lori Meeks, '' Hokkeji and the Reemergence of Female Monastic Orders in Premodern Japan'' (2010)  [https://www.amazon.com/Hokkeji-Reemergence-Monastic-Premodern-Buddhism/dp/0824833945/  excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\n== Christianity ==\n=== Roman Catholicism ===\n[[File:Andrea Mantegna 019.jpg|left|thumb|St. [[Scholastica]], sister of [[St. Benedict]] and foundress of the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] nuns]]\n[[File:Hildegard of bingen and nuns.jpg|thumb|[[Hildegard of Bingen]] and her nuns]]\n[[File:Maria Johanna von Zweyer c1800.jpg|thumb|Maria Johanna Baptista von Zweyer, Abbess of the Cistercian abbey of Wald]]\n[[File:Armand Gautier - Three Nuns in the Portal of a Church - Walters 371383.jpg|thumb|''Three [[Sisters of Mercy]] in the Portal of a Church'', by [[Armand Gautier]]]]\n\nIn the Roman Catholic tradition, there are a large number of [[religious institute]]s of nuns and sisters (the female equivalent of male [[monk]]s or [[friar]]s), each with its own [[charism]] or special character.

This last task is still often entrusted to women, called \"externs\", who live in the monastery, but outside the enclosure. They were usually either [[oblate]]s or members of the associated [[Third Order]], often wearing a different habit or the standard woman's attire of the period.\n\n====Membership and vows====\nIn general, when a woman enters a [[religious order]] or [[monastery]], she first undergoes a period of testing the life for six months to two years called a postulancy. If she, and the order, determine that she may have a [[vocation]] to the life, she receives the [[Religious habit|habit]] of the order (usually with some modification, normally a white veil instead of black, to distinguish her from [[Profession (religious)|professed]] members) and undertakes the [[novitiate]], a period (that lasts one to two years) of living the life of the religious institute without yet taking [[vows]].<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P25.HTM Canon 648], CIC 1983</ref> Upon completion of this period she may take her initial, temporary vows.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P26.HTM Canon 656], CIC 1983</ref> [[Temporary vows]] last one to three years, typically, and will be professed for not less than three years and not more than six.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P26.HTM Canon 655], CIC 1983</ref> Finally, she will petition to make her \"perpetual profession\", taking permanent, [[solemn vow]]s.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P26.HTM Canon 657], CIC 1983</ref>\n\nIn the branches of the [[Benedictine]] tradition, (Benedictines, [[Cistercian]]s, [[Camaldolese]], and [[Trappist]]s, among others) nuns take vows of stability (that is, to remain a member of a single monastic community), obedience (to an [[abbess]] or [[prioress]]), and conversion of life (which includes poverty and celibacy). In other traditions, such as the [[Poor Clares]] (the [[Franciscan]] Order) and the [[Dominican Order|Dominican nuns]], they take the threefold vows of [[poverty]], [[chastity]] and [[vow of obedience|obedience]]. These are known as the \u2018evangelical counsels\u2019 as opposed to \u2018monastic vows\u2019 proper. Most orders of nuns not listed here follow one of these two patterns, with some Orders taking an additional vow related to the specific work or character of their Order (for example, to undertake a certain style of devotion, praying for a specific intention or purpose).<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[File:Bridgettine-nuns.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bridgettines|Bridgettine Sisters]] at the [[March For Life in Washington, D.C.]], January 2009]]\n[[File:MotherTeresa 094.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mother Teresa]], founder of the [[Missionaries of Charity]]<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/mother-teresa-who-becomes-a-saint-on-sunday-began-her-life-as-a-nun-in-dublin-1.2777022|title=Mother Teresa, who becomes a saint on Sunday, began her life as a nun in Dublin|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/nun-in-iconic-italy-earthquake-photo-shares-her-story-of-survival/|title=Nun in iconic Italy quake photo shares her story of survival|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en}}</ref>]]\n\nCloistered nuns ([[Carmelites]], for example) observe \"papal enclosure\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P28.HTM Canon 667] \u00a73, CIC 1983, SCRIS instruction, \"Venite seorsum\" August 15, 1969, in AAS 61 (1969) 674\u2013690</ref> rules, and their nunneries typically have walls separating the nuns from the outside world. The nuns rarely leave (except for medical necessity or occasionally for purposes related to their contemplative life) though they may receive visitors in specially built parlors, often with either a grille or half-wall separating the nuns from visitors. They are usually self-sufficient, earning money by selling jams, candies or baked goods by mail order, or by making liturgical items (such as vestments, candles, or hosts to be consecrated at Mass for Holy Communion).\n\nThey often undertake contemplative ministries \u2013 that is, a community of nuns is often associated with prayer for some particular good or supporting the missions of another order by prayer (for instance, the Dominican nuns of [[Corpus Christi Monastery]] in [[the Bronx]], New York, pray in support of the priests of the [[Archdiocese of New York]]). Yet religious sisters can also perform this form of ministry, e.g., the [[Maryknoll]] Missionary Sisters have small houses of [[contemplative]] sisters, some in mission locations, who pray for the work of the priests, brothers and other sisters of their congregation, and since Vatican II have added retreat work and spiritual guidance to their apostoloate;<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.maryknollsisters.org/sisters/sister-grace-corde-myerjack/|title=Sister Grace Corde Myerjack \u2013 Maryknoll Sisters|work=Maryknoll Sisters|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-US}}</ref> the [[Sister Disciples of the Divine Master]] are also cloistered sisters who receive visitors and pray in support of their sister congregation,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pddm.us/p.promise94.php|title=Vocation: Sister Disciples Of The Divine Master|website=www.pddm.us|access-date=2018-05-24}}</ref> the [[Daughters of St. Paul]] in their media ministry.\n\n====Leadership====\nA [[canoness]] is a nun who corresponds to the male equivalent of [[Canon (priest)|canon]], usually following the Rule of S. Augustine. The origin and rules of monastic life are common to both. As with the canons, differences in the observance of rule gave rise to two types: the [[canoness regular]], taking the traditional religious vows, and the secular canoness, who did not take vows and thus remained free to own property and leave to marry, should they choose. This was primarily a way of leading a pious life for the women of aristocratic families and generally disappeared in the modern age, except for the modern [[Stift#Stift as endowment for unmarried Protestant women|Lutheran convents]] of Germany.\n\nA nun who is elected to head her religious house is termed an [[abbess]] if the house is an abbey, a prioress if it is a monastery, or more generically may be referred to as \"Mother Superior\" and styled \"Reverend Mother\". The distinction between abbey and monastery has to do with the terms used by a particular order or by the level of independence of the religious house. Technically, a [[convent]] is any home of a community of sisters \u2013 or, indeed, of priests and brothers, though this term is rarely used in the United States. The term \"monastery\" is often used by The Benedictine family to speak of the buildings and \"convent\" when referring to the community. Neither is gender specific. \u2018Convent\u2019 is often used of the houses of certain other institutes.\n\nThe traditional dress for women in religious communities consists of a [[tunic]], which is tied around the waist with a cloth or leather belt. Over the tunic some nuns wear a [[scapular]] which is a garment of long wide piece of woolen cloth worn over the shoulders with an opening for the head. Some wear a white [[wimple]] and a veil, the most significant and ancient aspect of the habit. Some Orders \u2013 such as the Dominicans \u2013 wear a large rosary on their belt. Benedictine abbesses wear a cross or crucifix on a chain around their neck.\n\nAfter the [[Second Vatican Council]], many religious institutes chose in their own regulations to no longer wear the traditional habit and did away with choosing a [[religious name]]. [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Catholic Church canon law]] states: \"Religious are to wear the habit of the institute, made according to the norm of proper law, as a sign of their consecration and as a witness of poverty.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P28.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law \u2013 IntraText|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2018-02-14}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2019, clerical abuse of nuns, including [[sexual slavery]], by [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Catholic priests]] has been acknowledged by the [[Pope]].<ref name=\"BBC-20190206\">{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Pope admits clerical abuse of nuns including sexual slavery |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47134033 |date=February 6, 2019 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=February 9, 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20190205\">{{cite news |author=The Associated Press |title=Pope Publicly Acknowledges Clergy Sexual Abuse of Nuns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/02/05/world/europe/ap-eu-rel-vatican-nun-abuse-.html |date=February 5, 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 9, 2019 |author-link=The Associated Press }}</ref>\n\n==== Distinction between a nun and a religious sister ====\n{{See also|Religious sister (Catholic)}}\n[[File:Irm\u00e3 Ros\u00e1lia Sehnem IFPCC7.JPG|left|thumb|Sister Ros\u00e1lia Sehnem of the [[Sisters of St. Francis of Penance and Christian Charity]]]]\n\nAlthough usage has varied throughout church history, typically \"nun\" (Latin: ''monialis'') is used for women who have taken solemn vows, and \"sister\" (Latin: ''soror'') is used for women who have taken simple vows.\n\nDuring the first millennium, nearly all religious communities of men and women were dedicated to prayer and [[contemplative prayer|contemplation]]. These [[monasteries]] were built in remote locations or were separated from the world by means of a [[precinct wall]]. The [[mendicant orders]], founded in the 13th century, combined a life of prayer and dedication to God with active works of preaching, hearing confessions, and service to the poor, and members of these orders are known as [[friars]] rather than [[monks]]. At that time, and into the 17th century, Church custom did not allow women to leave the [[cloister]] if they had taken religious vows.

There were very few rich [[American Catholics]], and no aristocrats.

The numbers grew rapidly, from 900 sisters in 15 communities in 1840, 50,000 in 170 orders in 1900, and 135,000 in 300 different orders by 1930.

Outside the home, Canadian women had few domains which they controlled. An important exception came with Roman Catholic nuns, especially in Qu\u00e9bec. Stimulated by the influence in France, the popular religiosity of the [[Counter Reformation]], new orders for women began appearing in the seventeenth century. In the next three centuries women opened dozens of independent religious orders, funded in part by [[Religious dower|dowries]] provided by the parents of young nuns. The orders specialized in charitable works, including hospitals, orphanages, [[maternity home|homes for unwed mothers]], and schools.<ref>Thomas Carr, Jr., \"Writing the Convent in New France: The Colonialist Rhetoric of Canadian Nuns\", ''Quebec Studies'' (2009), Issue 47, pp 3\u201323.</ref>\n\n'''Early Modern Spain'''\n\nPrior to women becoming nuns during early modern Spain, aspired nuns underwent a process.

In [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and other Eastern European languages, both domiciles are called \"monasteries\" and the ascetics who live therein are \"monastics\". In English, however, it is acceptable to use the terms \"nun\" and \"convent\" for clarity and convenience. The term for an abbess is the feminine form of abbot (''[[hegumen]]'') \u2013 Greek: ''hegumeni''; {{lang-sr|\u0418\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430 }}(''Igumanija''); Russian: \u0438\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, (''[[igumenia]]''). Orthodox monastics do not have distinct \"orders\" as in Western Christianity. Orthodox monks and nuns lead identical spiritual lives.<ref>Archpriest Seraphim Slobodskoy, ''The Law of God'' (Printshop of St. Job of Pochaev, Jordanville, NY, {{ISBN|0884650448}}), p. 618.</ref> There may be slight differences in the way a monastery functions internally but these are simply differences in style (Gr. ''[[typica]]'') dependent on the abbess or [[abbot]]. The abbess is the spiritual leader of the convent and her authority is absolute (no [[priest]], [[bishop]], or even [[patriarch]] can override an abbess within the walls of her monastery.) There has always been spiritual equality between men and women in the Orthodox Church ({{bibleverse||Galatians|3:28|KJV}}). Abbots and Abbesses rank in authority equal to bishops in many ways and were included in [[ecumenical council]]s. Orthodox monasteries are usually associated with a local synod of bishops by jurisdiction, but are otherwise self-governing. Abbesses hear [[Confession (religion)|confession]]s (but do not [[absolution|absolve]]) and dispense [[blessing]]s on their charges, though they still require the services of a [[presbyter]] (i.e., a priest) to celebrate the [[Divine Liturgy]] and perform other priestly functions, such as the absolution of a penitent.\n\nOrthodox monastics, in general have little or no contact with the outside world, especially family. The pious family whose child decides to enter the monastic profession understands that their child will become \"dead to the world\" and therefore be unavailable for social visits.\n\nThere are a number of different levels that the nun passes through in her profession:\n{{Main|Degrees of Eastern Orthodox monasticism}}\n\n*'''Novice \u2013''' When one enters a monastery the first three to five years are spent as a [[novitiate|novice]]. Novices may or may not (depending on the abbess's wishes) dress in the black inner robe ([[cassock|Isorassa]]); those who do will also usually wear the [[apostolnik]] or a black [[scarf]] tied over the head (see photo, above). The isorassa is the first part of the monastic \"[[Religious habit|habit]]\" of which there is only one style for Orthodox monastics (this is true in general, there have been a few slight regional variations over the centuries, but the style always seems to precipitate back to a style common in the 3rd or 4th century). If a novice chooses to leave during the novitiate period no penalty is incurred.\n*'''Rassaphore \u2013''' When the abbess deems the novice ready, the novice is asked to join the monastery. If she accepts, she is [[tonsure]]d in a formal service during which she is given the outer robe ([[Cassock|Exorassa]]) and veil ([[Epanokamelavkion]]) to wear, and (because she is now dead to the world) receives a new name. Nuns consider themselves part of a sisterhood; however, tonsured nuns are usually addressed as \"Mother\" (in some convents, the title of \"Mother\" is reserved to those who enter into the next level of Stavrophore).\n*'''Stavrophore \u2013''' The next level for monastics takes place some years after the first tonsure when the abbess feels the nun has reached a level of discipline, dedication, and [[humility]]. Once again, in a formal service the nun is elevated to the \"Little Schema\" which is signified by additions to her habit of certain symbolic articles of clothing. In addition, the abbess increases the nun's [[prayer rule]], she is allowed a stricter personal ascetic practice.\n*'''Great Schema \u2013''' The final stage, called \"Megaloschemos\" or \"[[Great Schema]]\" is reached by nuns whose Abbess feels they have reached a high level of excellence. In some monastic traditions the Great Schema is only given to monks and nuns on their death bed, while in others they may be elevated after as little as 25 years of service.\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|[[File:Nevrev-Princess.jpg|thumb|''Princess Praskovya Yusupova before becoming a nun'' [[Nikolai Nevrev]], 1886]]\n|[[File:Nun flowers black white.JPG|thumb|''The Way of Humility'': [[Russian Orthodox]] nun working at [[Ein Karem]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n|}\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Protestantism ===\n[[Image:Monastery Ebstorf.jpg|thumb|[[Ebstorf Abbey]] continued as a Lutheran convent in the Benedictine tradition since 1529.]]\nAfter the Protestant Reformation, some monasteries in Lutheran lands (such as [[Amelungsborn Abbey]] near [[Negenborn]] and [[Loccum Abbey]] in [[Rehburg-Loccum]]) and convents (such as [[Ebstorf Abbey]] near the town of [[Uelzen]] and [[Bursfelde Abbey]] in [[Bursfelde]]) adopted the Lutheran Christian faith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medievalhistories.com/kloster-ebstorf-convent-bad-bevensen-near-luneburg/|title=Kloster Ebstorf|date=8 August 2014|publisher=Medieval Histories|language=English|accessdate=20 November 2017|quote=The monastery is mentioned for the first time in 1197.

Lutherans were especially active, and within both Lutheranism and Anglicanism some Deaconesses formed religious communities, with community living, and the option of life vows in religion.<ref>See CSA history [http://anglicanhistory.org/women/rich_deaconesses1907/ here].</ref> The modern movement reached a zenith about 1910, then slowly declined as secularization undercut religiosity in Europe, and the professionalization of nursing and social work offered better career opportunities for young women.

This has allowed for communities of nuns (or, in some cases, mixed communities of nuns and monks) to be re-established in some Protestant traditions. Many of these are within the episcopal Lutheran tradition and the closeness of Lutheranism with Anglicanism its belief and practice has led to local arrangements of inter-Communion between the two traditions, such as the [[Porvoo Communion]].<ref name=\"TOI\">Israeli press report concerning one [http://www.timesofisrael.com/lutheran-nuns-end-jerusalem-mission-to-shoah-survivors/ German Lutheran order] of nuns.</ref>\n\n==== Anglicanism ====\n{{main|Anglican religious order}}\nReligious communities throughout England were destroyed by King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] when he separated the [[Church of England]] from papal authority during the [[English Reformation]] (see [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]). Monasteries and convents were deprived of their lands and possessions, and monastics were forced to either live a secular life on a pension or flee the country.  Many Roman Catholic nuns went to France.\n\n[[File:Julianofnorwich.jpg|thumb|Two Anglican nuns]]\nAnglican religious orders are organizations of [[laity]] or clergy in the [[Anglican Communion]] who live under a common rule. The term \"religious orders\" is distinguished from [[Holy Orders]] (the sacrament of [[ordination]] which bishops, priests, and deacons receive), though many communities do have ordained members.\n\nThe structure and function of religious orders in Anglicanism roughly parallels that which exists in Roman Catholicism. Religious communities are divided into orders proper, in which members take solemn vows and congregations, whose members take simple vows.\n\nWith the rise of the [[Oxford Movement]] in Anglicanism in the early 19th century came interest in the revival of \"religious life\" in England. Between 1841 and 1855, several religious orders for nuns were founded, among them the Community of St. Mary at [[Wantage]] and the Community of St. Margaret at [[East Grinstead]].\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the founding of Anglican religious orders of nuns began in 1845 with the Sisterhood of the Holy Communion (now defunct) in New York.\n\nWhilst there is no single central authority for all religious orders, and many member churches of the Anglican Communion have their own internal structures for recognising and regulating religious orders, some central functions are performed by the Anglican Religious Communities Department at [[Church House, Westminster]], the headquarters of the Church of England's [[Church Commissioners]], [[General Synod of the Church of England|General Synod]], [[Archbishops' Council]], and [[National Society for Promoting Religious Education|National Society]]. This department publishes the bi-annual ''Anglican Religious Life'', a world directory of religious orders, and also maintains an official Anglican Communion website for religious orders. ''Anglican Religious Life'' defines four categories of community.<ref>Anglican Religious Life 2012\u201313, published Canterbury Press, Norwich, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-84825-089-5}}, pp. iii, iv, 19, 147, 151, 171.</ref>\n* \"Traditional celibate religious orders and communities\": Members take a vow of celibacy (amongst other vows) and follow a common Rule of life. They may be enclosed and contemplative or open and engaged in apostolic works.\n* \"Dispersed communities\": These are orders or communities whose members, whilst taking vows (including celibacy), do not live together in community. In most cases the members are self-supporting and live alone, but follow the same Rule of life, and meet together frequently in assemblies often known as 'Chapter meetings'. In some cases some members may share a common life in very small groups of two or three.\n* \"Acknowledged communities\": These communities live a traditional Christian life, including the taking of vows, but the traditional vows are adapted or changed. In many cases these communities admit both single and married persons as members, requiring celibacy on the part of those who are single, and unfailing commitment to their spouse on the part of married members. They also amend the vow of poverty, allowing personal possessions, but requiring high standards of tithing to the community and the wider church. These communities often have residential elements, but not full residential community life, as this would be incompatible with some elements of married family life.\n* \"Other communities\": This group contains communities that are ecumenical (including Anglicans) or that belong to non-Anglican churches that have entered into relationships of full communion with the Anglican Church (particularly, but not only, certain Lutheran churches).\n\nIn the United States (only), there is a clear distinction between \"orders\" and \"communities\", as the Episcopal Church has its own two-fold definition of \"religious orders\" (equivalent to the first two groups above) and \"Christian communities\" (equivalent to the third group above).<ref>See Title III, Canon 24, sections 1 and 2 of the Canons of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, also quoted at [http://communities.anglicancommunion.org Anglican Communion Religious Communities].</ref>  The ''Anglican Religious Life'' directory affirms this, stating \"This distinction in not used in other parts of the Anglican Communion where 'communities' is also used for those who take traditional vows.\"<ref>''Anglican Religious Life 2012\u201313'', Canterbury Press, Norwich, 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-84825-089-5}}, p. 151.</ref>\n[[File:Kloster Bursfelde von NO.jpg|thumb|[[Bursfelde Abbey]] has continued as a Lutheran convent since A.D. 1579]]\n\nIn some Anglican orders, there are sisters who have been ordained and can celebrate the Eucharist.<ref>[http://www.ssmbos.com/Pages/whatwedo.html What We Do] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616160844/http://www.ssmbos.com/Pages/whatwedo.html |date=2010-06-16 }} sisters of St. Margaret, (Episcopal religious community of women)</ref>\n\n==== Lutheranism ====\nThere are a plethora of religious orders within the [[Lutheran Church]]es, such as the [[Order of Lutheran Franciscans]] and [[Daughters of Mary (Lutheran)|Daughters of Mary]].

A list of notable works in which nuns play a major part ranges from ''[[A Time for Miracles]]'', which is [[hagiography]], to realistic accounts by [[Kathryn Hulme]] and [[Monica Baldwin]], to the blatant [[nunsploitation]] of ''[[Sacred Flesh]]''. Works can include those which portray Catholic nuns or non-Catholic such as ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' (Anglican), and ''[[Minsara Kanavu]]''  (church of south India).\n\nMany stories that have depicted nuns have gone on to critical and audience acclaim such as ''[[Sister Act]]'', ''[[Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. These stories have been reproduced in both stage and film. Other examples of nuns in television and film include [[Sally Field]] in ''[[The Flying Nun]]'', [[Stephanie Beacham]] in ''[[Sister Kate (TV series)|Sister Kate]]'' and [[Meryl Streep]] in ''[[Doubt (2008 film)|Doubt]]''. Miss Clavel in the ''[[Madeline]]'' books and TV series is the nun of a French Catholic boarding school.\n\nNuns have been used as antagonists in stories including [[Jessica Lange]] as Sister Jude in ''[[American Horror Story]]'' or [[Vanessa Redgrave]] in ''[[The Devils (film)|The Devils]]''.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Bhutan (8026012145).jpg\nFile:Rollerblading nuns.jpg  \nFile:Hue Vietnam Nun-with-bicycle-01.jpg\nFile:2 nuns arranging flowers.jpg \nFile:Klaryska.JPG\nFile:Kitchen - Hotel Dieu, Beaune.jpg\nFile:Tibet - Flickr - Jarvis-5.jpg\nFile:Carmelitas de la comunidad de Nogoy\u00e1.jpg\nFile:Taiwanese Buddhist Nun Black Robes.jpeg\nFile:Vietnamese Buddhist Nun.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Religion}}\n* [[Sadhu|S\u0101dhv\u012b]], Hinduist religious women\n* [[Consecrated virgin]]\n* [[Deaconess]], Protestant religious women\n* [[Monk]], the male monastic\n* [[Monasticism]]\n* [[Priest]]\n* [[Miko]], a Japanese priestess\n* [[Catholic religious order]]\n* [[:Category:Nunsploitation films]]\n\n== References ==\n; Citations\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Arai, Paula Kane Robinson.

In 1999 it joined the [[Asian Tour]] and also became part of the [[European Tour]]'s expansion into Asia as a jointly sanctioned event. The event was not held from 2015 to 2019 but reappeared as an Asian Tour event in 2020 with prize money of [[United States dollar|US$]]1 million.\n\nFormer winners include world number 1 golfers [[Vijay Singh]] and [[Lee Westwood]].

Since the demise of [[Apartheid]] it remains a societal and an institutionalised problem.\n\n==Colonial racism==\n\nDuring the Colonial era, the Cape served as strategic base for the Colonial expansionist interests in the east. For this purpose settlements were established by the [[Dutch East India Company]] at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1652, followed by Britain seizing the Cape Colony in 1806 during the Napoleonic wars, resulting in some areas being governed by the British and some by the Dutch.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa|title=South Africa - Growth of the colonial economy|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nThe region attracted ivory and slave traders who imported slaves for wheat farming and viticulture to serve the European settlements. In response to Colonial subjugation, fleeing black natives and slaves, joined existing groups such as the Xhosa or formed groups that were headed by warlords such as those of Bloem, Kok and Barends families. By the late 18th century, Arabs and Europeans traded beads, brass, cloth, alcohol and firearms in return for slaves, ivory, gold, wax, cattle and skins. The profits from these trade practices encouraged the warlords to hunt elephants and slaves by raiding the local communities such as Rolong, Tlhaping, Huruthshe and Ngwaketse. During the [[Difaqane]], the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] under [[Shaka]] overran many smaller tribes and enslaved them.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAlthough slavery was formally abolished in 1833 with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]], slaves were continued to be imported from Britain's established settlements in India and the East Indies. The practice of importing slaves from India stretches back to the 1600s when the Dutch bought slaves from various parts of India who were sold by the then Muslim rulers. By the early part of the 18th century, 80% of the slaves were South Asians who were not just from the Indian subcontinent but also those South Asians who were living in South-East Asian countries such as Java.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/history-slavery-and-early-colonisation-south-africa|title=History of slavery and early colonisation in South Africa &#124; South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za}}</ref>\n\nThe Roman-Dutch law defined slaves as property that could be traded, bought and sold, a form of slavery known as '[[chattel slavery]]'. There are many examples of racism and discriminatory practices during the Colonial period such as whipping, starvation, being forced to work for long hours, laborers having to carry passes, being subject to high taxation, not being able to walk on the sidewalks, banned from living, entering or working in certain areas such as the Orange Free State.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Other examples include allocation of rations during the [[Siege of Ladysmith]].\n\n{{quote|\nFor Whites\u2014Biscuit, 1/4 lb.; Maize meal, 3 oz.<br/>\nFor Indians and Kaffirs\u2014Maize meal, 8 oz.<br/>\nEuropeans\u2014Fresh meat, 1 lb.<br/>\nKaffirs\u2014Fresh meat, 1-1/4 lbs.

W. Nevinson<ref>{{Gutenberg|no=16603|name=Ladysmith, The Diary of a Siege by Henry W. Nevinson}}</ref>}}\n\nThe word \"[[Kaffir (racial term)|Kaffir]]\" was used without derogatory connotations during the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]] and [[British Empire|British colonial periods]] until the early 20th century.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia\n  | title = Kaffirs\n  | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Britannica\n  | volume = 15\n  | pages = 627\u2013629\n  | year = 1911}}</ref>\n\n==Apartheid racism==\n\n{{See also|Apartheid}}\n[[Apartheid]] (Afrikaans pronunciation: {{IPA-af|a\u02c8part\u0266\u0259it|}}; an Afrikaans word meaning \"separateness\", or \"the state of being apart\", literally \"apart-hood\") was a system of racial segregation in South Africa enforced through legislation by the National Party (NP), the governing party from 1948 to 1994. Under apartheid, the rights, associations, and movements of the majority black inhabitants and other ethnic groups were curtailed, and white minority rule was maintained. Apartheid was developed after World War II by the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]]-dominated National Party and Broederbond organizations. The ideology was also enforced in South West Africa, which was administered by South Africa under a League of Nations mandate (revoked in 1966 via United Nations Resolution 2145), until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990. By extension, the term is currently used for forms of systematic segregation established by the state authority in a country against the social and civil rights of a certain group of citizens due to ethnic prejudices.\n\nThe Indian community has been subject to Zulu racist attacks dating back to the arrival of indentured labor in South Africa which ultimately resulted in the [[Durban Riots]] of 1949 followed by riots in 1985 where homes for 1500 Indians were set on fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-08-09/news/mn-2323_1_black-youths|title=Zulus Attack Indians Near Durban; Death Toll Mounts|first=United Press|last=International|date=9 August 1985|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Governmental racism under Apartheid ===\nThe first example of apartheid legislation was the ''[[Population Registration Act]]''. This act was the first to force citizens to be registered under their race, and this set the stage for later racial tension. One example of apartheid legislation was the ''[[Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959|Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act]]'', which was passed into law in 1959. This law forced White citizens to live in separate areas than Black citizens, and reserved much less land for the Black citizens to live, despite them making up a large majority of the population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/history-apartheid-south-africa|title=A history of Apartheid in South Africa|last=sahoboss|date=2016-05-06|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> The way the South African government did this at the time was by reserving off pieces of land called [[Bantustans]], and forcing the Black South Africans on to these pieces of land. There were 10 different Bantustans in total, all for separate ethnic groups. Once they moved on to these lands, the Black South Africans lost their rights as South Africans, and were forced to become permanent residents of the reserves. They were expected to run their own governments once they had arrived. \u00a0Economic conditions on these lands were not satisfactory for the people there, as the South African government put minimal effort policy-wise into developing these regions economically. Most of the time, residents of Bantustans would have to commute hours by bus or train to industrial zones on the border of their Bantustan. Even though the South African Government put lots of money towards trying to keep the Bantustans viable, the local governments were still plagued by corruption, so normal people rarely felt the effects of the government money. In the 1970\u2019s 4 of these Bantustans became independent and separated entirely from the South African government, and this was the intent of the Bantustans. To keep all the Black citizens out from South Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Laura|date=2017-07-27|title=History of South Africa's Bantustans|url=http://oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-80|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of African History|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.013.80|isbn=9780190277734}}</ref>\n\nAnother example of restricting legislation in South Africa is the ''Natives (Abolition of Passes and Coordination of Documents) Act of 1952''. This act forced Black South African citizens to carry their passbooks with them at all times. If someone was found without their passbook, they could be arrested for no reason other than that. This caused immense anger within the Black community, which would eventually spark the defiance campaign of 1952.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/pass-laws-south-africa-1800-1994|title=Pass laws in South Africa 1800-1994|last=sahoboss|date=2011-03-21|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\n\nThe oppressive nature of these apartheid laws sparked some resistance within the Black South African community, and several oppositional groups were formed. One of these groups that emerged was the ANC ([[African National Congress]]), a group which eventually became involved in many resistance activities. One movement the ANC got involved in was a defiance campaign in the Black suburb of Sharpeville. This eventually led to the [[Sharpeville massacre]], where 69 Black South Africans were killed, and 180 more were injured. This event resulted in the bloodiest apartheid protest that South Africa would see, and in the moment the Black South African community was horrified. In response, the following week was full of demonstrations, protests and marches. Because of this, the South African government saw fit to declare a state of emergency, and arrested thousands of people who had been protesting. Numbers approached 10,000 people by May, and many of these people were not released for months afterwards. Also in the fallout of the Sharpeville massacre, the South African government banned any organisations that were considered a threat to public safety or public order. This included organisations such as the ANC and the PAC (another organisation that was committed to activism for Black South Africans through peaceful protesting).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/sharpeville-massacre/|title=Sharpeville Massacre \u2022 BlackPast|date=2009-02-22|website=BlackPast|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\u00a0\n\nUnder apartheid, Black women were affected to an extreme degree due to discriminatory racial and gender laws. There were not many opportunities for women to become \u00a0political leaders, as many organisations allowed male membership only, so not many women did get very involved with politics. There were several organizations that let women join, or had entirely separate organizations there for women to join, one such being the ANCWL or ANC Women\u2019s League. In a protest of the ''[[Natives (Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents) Act|Natives (Abolition of Passes and Coordination of Documents) Act of 1952]]'' as mentioned above and several other pieces of legislation, many women participated in movements against the government for the first time in the form of the Defiance campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/women-and-struggle-against-apartheid|title=Women and the struggle against Apartheid &#124; South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za}}</ref> The defiance campaign was a movement organized in part by the ANC because of new apartheid legislation from the government. Women were not the only people to take part in this campaign, but the inclusion of women is noteworthy because this was the first campaign to see major participation from women. The movement itself involved thousands of Black citizens doing nonviolent things that would normally be considered as civil disobedience, such as going into areas that only White people were allowed into, or burning their pass books. The idea behind the movement, was that if enough Black people flooded the South African prison and judicial system, then it would force the government to reform the apartheid laws. Thousands of people were arrested in a matter of months, but the campaign did not accomplish its goal of forcing radical change. However, it did capture the attention of the global community, and that of the United Nations. In time the UN would launch an investigation into the apartheid policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/defiance-campaign-1952|title=Defiance Campaign 1952|last=Anonymous|date=2011-03-21|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980's, resistance to apartheid became extreme. The [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] was formed in order to try and unite people all over to join in the fight against government oppression. The leader of the front, [[Allan Boesak]], called for organizations all over South Africa to help him. This included churches, civic associations, trade unions, student organizations, and sports bodies. The UDF became extremely popular among the Black community, and helped unite everyone who was fighting for equality, something that had not happened in the past. The government\u2019s response was to declare another national emergency, and again South Africa saw thousands of arrests and hundreds of killing. However by 1990, the burden of so much public violence was too much. The government was losing its tight grip on the country, and eventually the state president, [[F. W. de Klerk|F.W. de Klerk]], decided that reform was absolutely necessary. This led to the end of apartheid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/organisations/united-democratic-front-udf|title=United Democratic Front (UDF)|last=tinashe|date=2011-03-30|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\n\n== Post-Apartheid racism ==\n\n=== Racism and related violence against black people ===\n\nAlthough Apartheid was abolished in South Africa, and overt racism against black people is on the decline, [[institutional racism]] is still common in South Africa.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2018-01-26-00-institutional-racism-is-still-alive-and-kicking-in-the-workplace|title=Institutional racism is still alive and kicking in the workplaces|work=mg|access-date=2019-04-18|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPenny Sparrow, a 70-year-old real estate agent suffering of blindness who lives in the coastal city of Durban compared African people as a whole to dirty monkeys that litter on the previously white only beaches  and was apologetic for her remarks, defending them as being taken out of context.

These allegations \u2014 made mostly by students but also some staff it has found evidence of \u201csystematic suppression of black excellence in recent years\u201d at the university, which is South Africa\u2019s oldest and one of its strongest in research. Submissions to the commission \u2014 which came from students, staff and the public \u2014 were \u201crife with stories of better qualified black academics being passed over for employment and promotion in favour of white academics\u201d. The report concludes that racism exists at UCT, \u201cabetted by poor management systems\u201d which \u201cdiscriminate on a racial basis\u201d. A lecturer was quoted saying \u201cInstitutional racism at UCT is practically the norm,\u201d. Black staff members remain under-represented in the university\u2019s senior decision-making bodies.

Since the demise of [[Apartheid]] it remains a societal and an institutionalised problem.\n\n==Colonial racism==\n\nDuring the Colonial era, the Cape served as strategic base for the Colonial expansionist interests in the east. For this purpose settlements were established by the [[Dutch East India Company]] at the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1652, followed by Britain seizing the Cape Colony in 1806 during the Napoleonic wars, resulting in some areas being governed by the British and some by the Dutch.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa|title=South Africa - Growth of the colonial economy|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nThe region attracted ivory and slave traders who imported slaves for wheat farming and viticulture to serve the European settlements. In response to Colonial subjugation, fleeing black natives and slaves, joined existing groups such as the Xhosa or formed groups that were headed by warlords such as those of Bloem, Kok and Barends families. By the late 18th century, Arabs and Europeans traded beads, brass, cloth, alcohol and firearms in return for slaves, ivory, gold, wax, cattle and skins. The profits from these trade practices encouraged the warlords to hunt elephants and slaves by raiding the local communities such as Rolong, Tlhaping, Huruthshe and Ngwaketse. During the [[Difaqane]], the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] under [[Shaka]] overran many smaller tribes and enslaved them.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAlthough slavery was formally abolished in 1833 with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]], slaves were continued to be imported from Britain's established settlements in India and the East Indies. The practice of importing slaves from India stretches back to the 1600s when the Dutch bought slaves from various parts of India who were sold by the then Muslim rulers. By the early part of the 18th century, 80% of the slaves were South Asians who were not just from the Indian subcontinent but also those South Asians who were living in South-East Asian countries such as Java.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/history-slavery-and-early-colonisation-south-africa|title=History of slavery and early colonisation in South Africa &#124; South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za}}</ref>\n\nThe Roman-Dutch law defined slaves as property that could be traded, bought and sold, a form of slavery known as '[[chattel slavery]]'. There are many examples of racism and discriminatory practices during the Colonial period such as whipping, starvation, being forced to work for long hours, laborers having to carry passes, being subject to high taxation, not being able to walk on the sidewalks, banned from living, entering or working in certain areas such as the Orange Free State.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Other examples include allocation of rations during the [[Siege of Ladysmith]].\n\n{{quote|\nFor Whites\u2014Biscuit, 1/4 lb.; Maize meal, 3 oz.<br/>\nFor Indians and Kaffirs\u2014Maize meal, 8 oz.<br/>\nEuropeans\u2014Fresh meat, 1 lb.<br/>\nKaffirs\u2014Fresh meat, 1-1/4 lbs.

Under apartheid, the rights, associations, and movements of the majority black inhabitants and other ethnic groups were curtailed, and white minority rule was maintained. Apartheid was developed after World War II by the [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]]-dominated National Party and Broederbond organizations. The ideology was also enforced in South West Africa, which was administered by South Africa under a League of Nations mandate (revoked in 1966 via United Nations Resolution 2145), until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990. By extension, the term is currently used for forms of systematic segregation established by the state authority in a country against the social and civil rights of a certain group of citizens due to ethnic prejudices.\n\nThe Indian community has been subject to Zulu racist attacks dating back to the arrival of indentured labor in South Africa which ultimately resulted in the [[Durban Riots]] of 1949 followed by riots in 1985 where homes for 1500 Indians were set on fire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-08-09/news/mn-2323_1_black-youths|title=Zulus Attack Indians Near Durban; Death Toll Mounts|first=United Press|last=International|date=9 August 1985|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Governmental racism under Apartheid ===\nThe first example of apartheid legislation was the ''[[Population Registration Act]]''. This act was the first to force citizens to be registered under their race, and this set the stage for later racial tension. One example of apartheid legislation was the ''[[Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959|Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act]]'', which was passed into law in 1959. This law forced White citizens to live in separate areas than Black citizens, and reserved much less land for the Black citizens to live, despite them making up a large majority of the population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/history-apartheid-south-africa|title=A history of Apartheid in South Africa|last=sahoboss|date=2016-05-06|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref> The way the South African government did this at the time was by reserving off pieces of land called [[Bantustans]], and forcing the Black South Africans on to these pieces of land. There were 10 different Bantustans in total, all for separate ethnic groups. Once they moved on to these lands, the Black South Africans lost their rights as South Africans, and were forced to become permanent residents of the reserves. They were expected to run their own governments once they had arrived. \u00a0Economic conditions on these lands were not satisfactory for the people there, as the South African government put minimal effort policy-wise into developing these regions economically. Most of the time, residents of Bantustans would have to commute hours by bus or train to industrial zones on the border of their Bantustan. Even though the South African Government put lots of money towards trying to keep the Bantustans viable, the local governments were still plagued by corruption, so normal people rarely felt the effects of the government money. In the 1970\u2019s 4 of these Bantustans became independent and separated entirely from the South African government, and this was the intent of the Bantustans. To keep all the Black citizens out from South Africa.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Laura|date=2017-07-27|title=History of South Africa's Bantustans|url=http://oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277734-e-80|journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of African History|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190277734.013.80|isbn=9780190277734}}</ref>\n\nAnother example of restricting legislation in South Africa is the ''Natives (Abolition of Passes and Coordination of Documents) Act of 1952''. This act forced Black South African citizens to carry their passbooks with them at all times. If someone was found without their passbook, they could be arrested for no reason other than that. This caused immense anger within the Black community, which would eventually spark the defiance campaign of 1952.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/pass-laws-south-africa-1800-1994|title=Pass laws in South Africa 1800-1994|last=sahoboss|date=2011-03-21|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\n\nThe oppressive nature of these apartheid laws sparked some resistance within the Black South African community, and several oppositional groups were formed. One of these groups that emerged was the ANC ([[African National Congress]]), a group which eventually became involved in many resistance activities. One movement the ANC got involved in was a defiance campaign in the Black suburb of Sharpeville. This eventually led to the [[Sharpeville massacre]], where 69 Black South Africans were killed, and 180 more were injured. This event resulted in the bloodiest apartheid protest that South Africa would see, and in the moment the Black South African community was horrified. In response, the following week was full of demonstrations, protests and marches. Because of this, the South African government saw fit to declare a state of emergency, and arrested thousands of people who had been protesting. Numbers approached 10,000 people by May, and many of these people were not released for months afterwards. Also in the fallout of the Sharpeville massacre, the South African government banned any organisations that were considered a threat to public safety or public order. This included organisations such as the ANC and the PAC (another organisation that was committed to activism for Black South Africans through peaceful protesting).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/sharpeville-massacre/|title=Sharpeville Massacre \u2022 BlackPast|date=2009-02-22|website=BlackPast|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\u00a0\n\nUnder apartheid, Black women were affected to an extreme degree due to discriminatory racial and gender laws. There were not many opportunities for women to become \u00a0political leaders, as many organisations allowed male membership only, so not many women did get very involved with politics. There were several organizations that let women join, or had entirely separate organizations there for women to join, one such being the ANCWL or ANC Women\u2019s League. In a protest of the ''[[Natives (Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents) Act|Natives (Abolition of Passes and Coordination of Documents) Act of 1952]]'' as mentioned above and several other pieces of legislation, many women participated in movements against the government for the first time in the form of the Defiance campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/women-and-struggle-against-apartheid|title=Women and the struggle against Apartheid &#124; South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za}}</ref> The defiance campaign was a movement organized in part by the ANC because of new apartheid legislation from the government. Women were not the only people to take part in this campaign, but the inclusion of women is noteworthy because this was the first campaign to see major participation from women. The movement itself involved thousands of Black citizens doing nonviolent things that would normally be considered as civil disobedience, such as going into areas that only White people were allowed into, or burning their pass books. The idea behind the movement, was that if enough Black people flooded the South African prison and judicial system, then it would force the government to reform the apartheid laws. Thousands of people were arrested in a matter of months, but the campaign did not accomplish its goal of forcing radical change. However, it did capture the attention of the global community, and that of the United Nations. In time the UN would launch an investigation into the apartheid policy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/defiance-campaign-1952|title=Defiance Campaign 1952|last=Anonymous|date=2011-03-21|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980's, resistance to apartheid became extreme. The [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] was formed in order to try and unite people all over to join in the fight against government oppression. The leader of the front, [[Allan Boesak]], called for organizations all over South Africa to help him. This included churches, civic associations, trade unions, student organizations, and sports bodies. The UDF became extremely popular among the Black community, and helped unite everyone who was fighting for equality, something that had not happened in the past. The government\u2019s response was to declare another national emergency, and again South Africa saw thousands of arrests and hundreds of killing. However by 1990, the burden of so much public violence was too much. The government was losing its tight grip on the country, and eventually the state president, [[F. W. de Klerk|F.W. de Klerk]], decided that reform was absolutely necessary.
