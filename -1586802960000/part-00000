The eastern ridgeline of the valley is named Massanuten and is basicallyt continuous for the eastern length of Fort Valley.  The western ridgeline of the valley is composed of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain, which has a smaller valley called Little Fort Valley between it and the western ridgelines. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains and promontories within Forth Valley.\n\nFort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point called Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the entire valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountains in the south and flowing north, aided by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. \n\nFort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. \n\n==Roads and Gaps==\n\nBetween Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the Woodstock Tower, which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain offering panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley. Woodstock Tower is a historic observation post built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. \n\nBetween Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley on the east, over Massanutten Mountain, from Camp Roosevelt to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.\n\nRoads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over [[Powell Mountain]].\n\n==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==\n\nThe [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above Shenandoah State Park on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. \n\nThe [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)\n\n==History==\nAccording to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley from the north, at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible last stand against the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. The [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] made Washington's plans unnecessary.\n\n[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 \u2013 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.\n\nSignal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley that offers sweeping and unobstructed panoramic views of of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as a strategic military observation post. The observation post can view the nearby Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook. It's accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace.\n\nThe [[Daniel Munch House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Landforms of Shenandoah County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Valleys of Virginia]]\n\n\n{{ShenandoahCountyVA-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=February 2014}}\n{{Infobox valley\n| name = Fort Valley\n| photo = Fort_Valley_air.jpg\n| photo_caption = Air photo of Fort Valley, facing south, with the North (right) and South (left) Forks of the [[Shenandoah River]] visible.

The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.\n\nSignal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley that offers sweeping and unobstructed panoramic views of of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as a strategic military observation post. The observation post can view the nearby Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook. It's accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace.\n\nThe [[Daniel Munch House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Landforms of Shenandoah County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Valleys of Virginia]]\n\n\n{{ShenandoahCountyVA-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Woodrusher", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Valley_(Virginia)"}

In July 1953, Israel began construction of an intake for its National Water Carrier at the Daughters of Jacob Jordan Bridge in the demilitarized zone north of the Sea of Galilee. Syrian artillery units opened fire on the construction site.  The [[United Nations]] security council majority (excepting the USSR) voted for the resumption of work by Israel. The Israelis then moved the intake to an economically inferior site at the Sea of Galilee.<ref  name=\"IwaoH1998p129\"/>\n\nIn 1955 the [[Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan]] (Johnston Plan) was accepted by the technical committees of both Israel and the Arab League, but the Arab League Council decided not to ratify the plan on 11 October 1955. According to most observers, including Johnston himself, the Arab non-adoption of the plan was not total rejection. While they failed to approve it politically, they nevertheless seemed determined to adhere to the technical details of the agreement. Moreover, it continued to be taken seriously by Arab leaders.<ref  name=\"Gat2003p101\"/> Though the Unified Plan failed to be ratified, both [[Jordan]] and [[Israel]] undertook to operate within their allocation limits.\n\n===Main phase: 1964\u201367===\n[[Israel]] completed its [[National Water Carrier]] project, which siphoned water from the [[Sea of Galilee]] in 1964. The initial diversion capacity of the National Water Carrier, without supplementary booster pumps, was 320 million m<sup>3</sup>, well within the limits of the Johnston Plan.[[Image:National Water Carrier of Israel-en.svg|thumb|200px]] \nNevertheless, the Arab states were not prepared to coexist with a project which seemed likely to make a major contribution to [[Israel]]'s economic growth. In January 1964 an Arab League summit meeting convened in Cairo and decided:\n<blockquote> The establishment of Israel is the basic threat that the Arab nation in its entirety has agreed to forestall. And since the existence of Israel is a danger that threatens the Arab nation, the diversion of the Jordan waters by it multiplies the dangers to Arab existence. Accordingly, the Arab states have to prepare the plans necessary for dealing with the political, economic and social aspects, so that if necessary results are not achieved, collective Arab military preparations, when they are not completed, will constitute the ultimate practical means for the final liquidation of Israel.<ref name=\"Shlaim2000p229\"/> </blockquote>\n\nThe Arab states decided to deprive Israel of 35% of the National Water Carrier capacity, by a [[Headwater Diversion Plan (Jordan River)|diversion of the Jordan River headwaters]] (both the Hasbani and the Banias) to the [[Yarmouk River]]. The scheme was only marginally feasible, as it was technically difficult and expensive.\n\nA major escalation took place in 1964 when Israel declared it would regard the Diversion Project as an infringement on its sovereign rights.<ref name=\"Shapland1997p13\">{{cite book|author=Greg Shapland|title=Rivers of Discord: International Water Disputes in the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDKJV-916UoC&pg=PR7|accessdate=15 July 2013|year=1997|publisher=C.

In July 1953, Israel began construction of an intake for its National Water Carrier at the Daughters of Jacob Jordan Bridge in the demilitarized zone north of the Sea of Galilee. Syrian artillery units opened fire on the construction site.  The [[United Nations]] security council majority (excepting the USSR) voted for the resumption of work by Israel.

While they failed to approve it politically, they nevertheless seemed determined to adhere to the technical details of the agreement.

And since the existence of Israel is a danger that threatens the Arab nation, the diversion of the Jordan waters by it multiplies the dangers to Arab existence.

By the late 1930s, the company had expanded into automobile production supplying [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]-designed trucks to the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]]. Vehicle production continued until 1941, when [[World War II]] reached Yugoslavia. Following the war, Zastava was permitted to produce Jeeps under license from [[Willys-Overland]] until production was halted in the early 1950s.\n\nThe first passenger models were produced on 26 August 1953 using designs licensed by Fiat of [[Turin]]. The first model designed by Zastava was a sedan called the Milletrecento (\"one thousand three hundred\") powered by a 1,300 [[Cubic centimeter|cc]] engine. Some of the most successful models were those based on the [[Fiat 128]] model, marketed under different names: Zastava 101, Zastava 128, Zastava 311, Zastava Skala, etc.\n\nZastava continued to produce vehicles for the Yugoslav and European markets until exports were limited by sanctions imposed by the [[United Nations]] in the 1990s. In 1984, automobile entrepreneur Malcolm Bricklin tested the United States market for Zastava vehicles, now branded as Yugo. As a result, in mid-1986, Yugo America began selling cars at a starting price of $3,990 for the entry-level GV (\"Good Value\") hatchback equipped with the 1,100 cc overhead-cam five-main-bearing engine and four-speed manual transmission. The similar GVL offered a plusher interior, but the sporty top-line GVX was powered by the 1,300 cc engine mated to a five-speed manual transmission, and included as standard equipment a number of deluxe features such as a ground-effects package, alloy wheels, and rally lights. However, though the GVX was billed as an upscale, sporty version of the base GV, it went from 0-60&nbsp;mph in 13.56 seconds, just a half a second faster than the GV.<ref name=Vuic>{{citation | title = The Yugo: The Rise and Fall of the Worst Car in History | last = Vuic | first = Jason | page = 176 | publisher = Hill and Wang | location = New York City | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-8090-9891-0}}</ref> When the political instability in Yugoslavia intensified in early 1992, Zastava was forced to stop exports.\n\nToday, various models are available in the former Yugoslavia, including an agreement signed with Fiat for the production of the 2003 [[Fiat Punto]] model.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://english.eastday.com/eastday/englishedition/business/userobject1ai1474719.html english.eastday.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212130356/http://english.eastday.com/eastday/englishedition/business/userobject1ai1474719.html |date=2006-02-12 }}</ref>\n\n===1988\u20131991===\n[[File:Yugo Police Car.jpg|thumb|A 1990 Yugo police car in [[Croatia]]]]\nMany mechanics and even Zastava factory workers agree that the \"best\" Yugos ever were built between 1988 and early 1991. Quality control was good; high standards were set in terms of plastic quality, seat cloth, and \"a well screwed together\" interior. Paint and antirust coatings were also well done during that period, evidenced by many cars still showing no signs of rust, tears in the seats, or major engine issues after more than 20 years.\n\n1989 was considered a \"golden year\" for Yugos because almost 200,000 were built that year, and many can still be seen on the road today. Also, cars were usually branded Yugo instead of Zastava during that period, because the company was taking pride in the (at the time) good sales and reputation established in the export markets, especially in the United States.\n\nIn 1990, a batch of 450 cars with automatic transmissions and [[air conditioning]] was shipped to the United States. With political problems starting in 1991, quality dropped significantly, coming to such low standards such as plastic parts of the dashboard not fitting correctly.\n\n===1991\u20131996===\nBecause the Yugo was built as a \"Yugoslav\" car with political problems and civil war breaking out in 1990\u201391, production slowed down and the supply of parts was interrupted. Most of the plastic came from Croatia, while the alternators and electrical equipment came from Slovenia. With the start of civil war, economic and transportation ties were broken, resulting in shortage of most parts coming from the two seceded republics. Though the sanctions were not in place until May 1992, Yugos built between June 1991 and early 1996 were built with a variety of \"leftover\" parts: as an example, getting a car with a blue dashboard and a brown steering wheel, seats that were mismatched in color, and most likely an \"American\" instrument cluster with speeds printed in MPH rather than km/h, and with written labels like water and oil instead of small drawings, and a seatbelt safety warning light were possible. In some extreme cases, the car would come with different interior panels and a steering wheel from other Zastava products such as the Zastava 750. When exports to United States (and the rest of the world) stopped, a number of federalized Yugos were still left in the factory's parking lots, and many people got these \"American\" Yugos instead of the European ones. When Yugoslavia broke apart in the early 1990s, production rates steeply declined to 14,000 in 1992, 7,000 in 1993 and 1994, and 9,000 in 1995. In 1996, when sanctions were lifted, production rates slowly increased as living standards in the former Yugoslavia started to improve. Even so, problems for the factory started once again when it was put out of production in mid-1999 as a result of war with [[NATO]].\n\n===In the United States===\n{{refimprove-section|date=February 2020}}\n\nInternational Automobile Importers (IAI) was a company founded by [[Malcolm Bricklin]] to import the X1/9 and 2000 Spider after Fiat halted their manufacture.<ref>Vuic, p. 21</ref> Bertone and [[Pininfarina]] carried on production under their own names and Bricklin's IAI took over their U.S. importation. Bricklin wanted to import additional brands, and international dealmaker [[Armand Hammer]] had been asked by the Yugoslavs to identify business areas in which they could generate exports to bolster their economy. Hammer thought the idea of exporting the small cars made in [[Kragujevac]], Serbia, by Zavodi Crvena Zastava, would be viable. Zastava had, since the mid-19th century, been a quality armaments producer and sponsored its own museum.\n\nAs Zastava celebrated its 100th anniversary, it started producing vehicles made under license from the Italian company Fiat, located just across the [[Adriatic]] Sea. For three decades, Zastava produced the rear-engined 600 and the 101, a bustle-backed version of the [[Fiat 128]]. On its own initiative in 1980, Zastava introduced its Jugo or Yugo model which, though still using Fiat 128-type powertrain and other components, was in fact an update of the Fiat 127{{CN|date=February 2020}} styled in Turin.{{CN|date=February 2020}}. Zastava was already exporting its new offering to other Eastern European markets, installing the bigger 128 overhead-cam engine for a top speed of {{convert|90|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n[[File:Blue Yugo GV in San Francisco.jpg|thumb|left|Yugo GV in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]]]\n[[File:Black tuned Yugo GV.jpg|thumb|left| Yugo GV in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], Ohio]]\n[[File:Red Yugo GV in Junction Triangle, Toronto, Canada 2.jpg|thumb|Yugo GV in Junction Triangle, [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]]]]\n[[File:1987 Yugo GV.jpg|thumb|1987 Yugo GV in [[Los Angeles County, California]]]]\n[[File:Red Yugo GVX.jpg|thumb|Yugo GVX (1.3 EFI version) in [[Wausau, Wisconsin]]]]\nIn 1982, U.S. entrepreneur Miro Kefurt contacted Zastava in Kragujevac (ZCZ-Zavodi Crvena Zastava) with an idea to export the Yugo 45 to the United States.<ref>Vuic, p. 11</ref> The vehicles were to be renamed Yugo GV for the United States market and YugoCars, Inc. was formed in [[Sun Valley, California]], by Kefurt and Ray Burns. The proposal required approval by Fiat in [[Italy]] due to existing contractual restrictions in effect for Fiat\u2014Zastava collaborations.\n\nThe first three Yugo vehicles, painted red, white, and blue, were introduced to the U.S. public at the [[LA Auto Show|Los Angeles Auto Show]] in May 1984. The car was promoted with a 10-year/100,000-mile warranty, free maintenance, and a price of only $4,500. Front-page articles about the Yugo appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (Business Section), ''[[New York Times]]'', and ''[[The National Enquirer]]''. However, problems soon arose as one car was sent to the [[California Air Resources Board]] for emissions testing, which it badly failed. The Yugo needed lots of reengineering, and with no help forthcoming from Zastava, Kefurt was in a problematic situation.<ref>Vuic, p. 16</ref>\n\nReportedly, [[Malcolm Bricklin]] attended the Los Angeles Auto Show, and while the show was still in progress, flew to Yugoslavia to make a deal to import the Yugo to the United States himself. But Kefurt and YugoCars already held the exclusive import contract for 5,000 vehicles for the 1985 model year to be sold only in [[California]], and the California emissions certification was already in progress. In November 1984, the marketing rights were sold by YugoCars to International Automobile Importers (IAI) for $50,000 ($10 per car). Additionally, Miro Kefurt obtained an exclusive dealer franchise from IAI to sell the [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]] [[X1/9]] in [[North Hollywood, California]]. \n\nYugoCars had intended to fit their Yugo 45 with the 903-cc, 45-horsepower 4-cylinder engine with a 3-way [[catalytic converter]] and [[oxygen sensor]] for emissions control. Predicted gas mileage was 42 to 45 mpg at 70&nbsp;mph. In late 1983, Zastava added a version called the Yugo 55, powered by a bigger engine used in the Fiat 101/128. IAI's Tony Ciminera preferred using this larger, 1,100 cc engine making 55 horsepower, though it would drop fuel economy to the 30&nbsp;MPG range, for it was faster and more able to keep up on American freeways. Even so, with an {{convert|86|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} top speed, it was the slowest car sold in the United States.<ref>Vuic, p. 83</ref>\n\nSetting up Yugo America to import the car, Bricklin assigned Bill Prior to sort out the distribution and Tony Ciminera to fine-tune the Yugo for the American market. Ciminera carried out a bumper-to-bumper audit that resulted in more than 500 changes to meet the needs of the U.S. market, including compliance with American [[NHTSA|safety]] and [[Vehicle emissions control|emissions]] regulations. The vast Yugo facility was patterned after the Fiat factories of the early 1950s and employed 50,000, divided among 85 basic associated labor organizations and 25 work committees. For U.S. models, a separate assembly line was built with handpicked elite staff earning extra pay ($1.23 per hour extra), building Yugos destined for the New World. The first shift began at 6:00 am, and after an [[eight-hour day]], many employees left for their second jobs in other workplaces.{{CN|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe chief engineer and head of Zastava's Research and Development Institute was Zdravko Menjak, who worked with Bricklin's people at the plant to monitor the effort, constantly stressing the need for high quality. A team of British quality experts went to Kragujevac to study the factory and recommend improvements.{{CN|date=February 2020}}\n\nFive models of Yugo were sold in the United States for the 1987 model year: the basic entry-level $3,990 GV (for \"Great Value\"){{CN|date=February 2020}}, the GVC with a glass sunroof, the nearly identical GVL and GVS with minor trim and upholstery upgrades, and the GVX with the 1,300-cc engine, five-speed manual transmission, and standard equipment including a plush interior, ground-effects package, alloy wheels, and rally lights. The Cabrio [[convertible]] was introduced in 1988.\n\nIn the late 1980s, an automatic transmission was being sourced from Renault and a larger model (named the \"[[Yugo Florida|Florida]]\") had been styled by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and was in the early manufacturing stages. With the end of [[communism]], however, Yugoslavia began to unravel.\n\nBy 1990, the GV, GVL, and the 1,100-cc engine and four-speed manual transmission were replaced by a 1,300-cc [[OHC]] engine and five-speed manual transmission or a [[Renault]]-designed three-speed [[automatic transmission]], and an air conditioner with a holder for cooling two soft drink cans became optional on the GVX model. The standard model became the GV Plus.{{CN|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[File:Yugo-US-poster.jpg|thumb|Ad for Yugo in the U.S. market]]\nIn 1990, Yugo America introduced an [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] version of the Yugo GVX to replace the primitive [[Carburetor|carbureted]] engine,<ref>Vuic, p. 191</ref> but it arrived too late as the result of a [[Product recall|recall]] by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] of over 126,000 vehicles sold in the United States because they violated emissions regulations.{{CN|date=February 2020}} The recall effectively caused Yugo America to cease importation and fold in April 1992.<ref name=statistics>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=8_tS2Vw13FcC&dat=19920421&printsec=frontpage&hl=en |title=Poor sales, civil war end for boxy, undependable Yugo |page=8 |author=Toledo Blade |publisher=The Toledo Blade Company |work=[[Google News]] |date=April 21, 1992 |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}</ref> The noncompliant emission system used a carburetor of outdated design, an old-fashioned two-way [[catalytic converter]] with an [[Secondary air injection|air pump]], and [[exhaust gas recirculation]]. The power-reducing application of this primitive emissions control equipment on an already-weak engine was one of the major problems that caused the vehicles to get a reputation for poor drivability.{{CN|date=February 2020}}\n\nBy the early 1990s, the effects of the United Nations sanctions on Yugoslavia forced Zastava to withdraw the car from every export market. After embargoes stifled production, the ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'' was NATO's 1999 bombing of the company's automotive division, instead of Zastava's arms manufacturing division. Only in 2000 could production be restarted and not until 2003 was the Florida launched.\n\nMalcolm Bricklin signed a deal with Zastava in 2002 to bring the Yugo back to the U.S. with a model tentatively called the ZMW.

These cars were based upon the Fiat 128 which had been voted European car of the year in 1969. The Kragujevac factory produced faithful copies of the 128 saloon, known as the Zastava 128 (Osmica) and then from 1971 also began production of the Zastava 101. The legendary \u201cStojadin\u201d was a Fiat 128 with a redesigned rear which was available in three- and five-door hatchback versions. In 1982\u20131983, as sales slowly improved, Zastava Cars Limited introduced special trim levels in the form of the \u201cMediterranean\u201d and the \u201cCaribbean\u201d. The United Kingdom market was the only market catered for right-hand drive versions.\n\nBy the time the first British users were adjusting to their new Yugoslav machines, attention in Yugoslavia had moved away from the Stojadin towards the new \u201cYugo\u201d series which began production in October 1980 and appeared on British roads from 1983 onwards. The \u201cType 102\u201d answered a call for a small, economical family car and was based mechanically on Fiat\u2019s 127 hatchback. The styling of the car also owed much to the contemporary small Italian [[Autobianchi]] [[Abarth]], which was never available in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe \u201cType 102\u201d morphed into the early production Yugo 45 with a 903 cc engine, later into the 55 with a 1,116 cc engine and then the more powerful 65 fitted with a 1,301 cc engine also became available in the British market. The new Yugo competed with indigenous cars such as the [[Austin Metro|Austin Mini-Metro]] and [[Ford Fiesta (first generation)|Ford Fiesta MK1]]/[[Ford Fiesta (second generation)|MK2]], captive imports such as the [[Vauxhall Nova]] ([[Opel Corsa]] A), and French models like the [[Citro\u00ebn Visa]] and [[Talbot Samba]].\n\nIn 1984 only, Zastava (GB) LTD imported small numbers of the Zastava 128. After that, with the company\u2019s branding altered to \u201cYugo Cars\u201d, relegating the Zastava name to the small print, Zastava (GB) LTD concentrated on selling the 101 range, branded as Yugo 311/313/511/513, and the 45/55/65 series. The cars sold steadily throughout the decade, and though they managed to avoid the dreadful reviews reserved for Lada and FSO, commentators in the British motoring press were rarely more than lukewarm in their praise of the car - a headline from 1986 read \u201cThe Yugo 55 is a good small car, but would you be seen in one?\u201d\n\nIn 1988, Zastava launched the first of its new \u201cFlorida\u201d range, envisaged as a long-term replacement for the ageing Stojadin. Styled by Giorgetto Guigiaro, the car was a modern design for the time, and bore more than a passing resemblance to the [[Citro\u00ebn ZX]]. The Florida, marketed as the \u201cSana\u201d in the United Kingdom, first appeared in Britain in 1990<ref>Vuic, p. 68</ref> and seemed set to fare well with positive early reviews. The Stojadin range ceased to be exported to the United Kingdom in 1991, with sales of the Sana under way.\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, Yugoslavia was on the brink of a disintegration that many anticipated under the leadership of [[Josip Broz Tito]]. Slovenia was the first to secede from the federation in the middle of 1991, swiftly followed by Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and finally Macedonia. Hostilities, other than in Macedonia, began not long afterwards.\n\nThis had direct implications for the company at Kragujevac. The Yugo had been envisaged as an all-Yugoslav car; the alternator came from Slovenia, the plastics and the interior from factories in Croatia, and the seats and rear trunk-struts from Serbia via Kosovo. The disintegration of the Yugoslav federation suddenly had supplies dry up at Kragujevac and production rates declined steeply. The Sana may well have established Yugo as a fixture in the United Kingdom market in the 1990s, but political developments left this prospect unrealized.\n\n[[File:White Zastava Koral In during the Belgrade Car Show.jpg|thumb|Late-model Zastava Koral at a Belgrade Car Show]]\nAs the events of the wars of Yugoslav succession (1991\u201395 and 1999) unfolded, Zastava (GB) LTD became a barely noticed casualty. During Easter 1999, the Zastava factory in Kragujevac was targeted by NATO forces during the [[Kosovo]] campaign, and whilst severely damaged, was not put out of action. Supplies of vehicles to the United Kingdom were, however, reduced to a trickle in 1991 and 1992 and with the imposition of United Nations sanctions on [[Slobodan Milosevi\u0107]]'s rump Yugoslavia (consisting of Serbia and Montenegro), the company folded in 1993. The remaining Yugos on dealer forecourts were sold at drastically reduced prices or written off altogether as economically unviable.\n\n====Marketing====\nThe Yugo was vigorously marketed in the late 1980s as a car that would fit into everybody's life, providing basic economical and reliable transportation along the lines of the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and the earlier [[Ford]] [[Model T]]. The car was promoted as a uniquely affordable new vehicle&nbsp;\u2014 providing an option for buyers who would otherwise have chosen a used vehicle&nbsp;\u2014 and as a reliable second car for wealthier buyers. The Yugo carried the tagline \"Everybody Needs A Yugo Sometime.\"<ref>{{YouTube|VV9NOBYDC4|Yugo}}</ref> This marketing appealed successfully to its target market of low-budget new car buyers, as well as wealthier people looking for an affordable second or third car.<ref>PETERS, E (2004): ''Automotive Atrocities: The Cars We Love to Hate''. Motorbooks International.</ref> A popular ad included the 39-90 campaign, a play on the $3,990 price of the car.\n\n==Criticism and response==\nAlong with other Central and Eastern European vehicles marketed in the West during the 20th century&nbsp;\u2014 such as the [[\u0160koda Auto|\u0160koda]] \u2014 the Yugo was subjected to derision by critics who pointed to its use of old-generation Fiat technology and to alleged issues with build quality and reliability.

However, in an interference engine, failure of the timing belt disrupts the synchronization between pistons and [[poppet valve]]s, causing them to collide with one another (hence the name interference engine), thus potentially destroying the engine. Though this requirement was stressed in owners' manuals, it was frequently overlooked by owners. The factory also stressed the need for 89-octane fuels for the low-compression engines.\n\nSome Yugo owners have reported that regular oil changes and appropriate maintenance allow the cars to remain dependable and trouble-free.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inet.hr/~bpauric/eindex.htm |title=YUGO CARS.Web - English |publisher=Inet.hr |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614220936/http://www.inet.hr/~bpauric/eindex.htm |archive-date=2011-06-14 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, 31-year-old Leslie Ann Pluhar, driving a 1987 Yugo over the [[Mackinac Bridge]] in Michigan, died when her Yugo went over the bridge's {{convert|36|in|mm|adj=on}} railing during {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} winds.

Also, the simplicity of the car's engine makes it easy to fix, and many Yugoslavian owners tended to fix the car themselves. All parts for the Yugo are readily available in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/10q3/ancient_grease_inside_the_midwest-bayless_fiat_shop-feature |title=Inside the Midwest-Bayless Fiat Shop - Feature |publisher=Car and Driver |accessdate=2011-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829111844/http://www.caranddriver.com/features/10q3/ancient_grease_inside_the_midwest-bayless_fiat_shop-feature |archive-date=2011-08-29 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nA common U.S. joke regarding an inefficient vehicle is \"Yugo Nowhere\" (\"You Go Nowhere\"), referring to the failure of the car's sales in the United States.\n\nA Zastava 101 (a sedan variant of the Yugo line) has been featured on the British motoring show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', where it was featured in a segment filmed in Albania, where the three presenters referred to it as a \"Bentley Mulsanne\" after Bentley decided not to allow ''Top Gear'' to use an actual Mulsanne against a Mercedes S-Class 65 and a Rolls Royce Ghost. While presenters Richard Hammond and James May drove the very new Mercedes and Rolls Royce, respectively, Clarkson was originally supposed to drive the very new Bentley- so he had to drive the Yugo. In addition to Clarkson calling the Yugo \"the least refined car I've ever driven\", it was lambasted constantly, at one point overheated and failed to start, thoroughly physically trashed, and then driven off a cliff and destroyed while May was driving it to simulate a mock death for May after a staged police chase through Albania. In one segment in that episode, they attempted to put an obese Albanian man playing dead (sticking with their theme of which car they thought would be best for the Albanian Mafia) into the boot (trunk) of their cars. Surprisingly, the Yugo was the only successful car at this challenge, although the \"dead\" man was very visible in the car. It was also featured in one of Clarkson's motoring programs in the 1990s called ''Jeremy Clarkson: Unleashed on Cars''. He drove the Yugo, and after lambasting its performance, styling, and build quality, he then blew it up with a tank gun, and ran it over and crushed it with that same tank, totally destroying the car and reducing it to scrap metal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHmas6JXVi8|title=Jeremy Clarkson destroying Yugo 45 & Volvo|last=Du\u0161an Eremi\u0107|date=10 May 2008|via=YouTube|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925183002/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHmas6JXVi8|archive-date=2015-09-25|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==End of production==\nWith the 794,428th and final car, production ended on November 11, 2008.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fawkes |first=Helen |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7739319.stm |title=Europe &#124; Yugo production grinds to a halt |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-11-20 |accessdate=2009-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201105247/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7739319.stm |archive-date=2009-02-01 |url-status=live }}</ref>\nOf that number, around 250,000 were exported to various countries.\n\n==Today==\nYears after its demise, the Yugo is still a common sight in Serbia, with almost 60,000 vehicles still in use,{{when|date=October 2015}} most of which were built in the 2000s. Parts are still readily available at most auto-parts stores and in scrapyards across the country. However, Yugos are rare in other Yugoslav republics (Excluding [[North Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]]), particularly in Slovenia, because most of them were \"imported\" back to Serbia in the early 2000s, most likely because most of them were in good shape for their age.\n\nIn the United States, few Yugos are left in service, likely because of international sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, which limited the supply of spare parts and service locations. The United Kingdom has around 100 Yugos still in existence and an owners club has been created. Unlike in the United States, the Yugo was never considered to be one of the worst cars ever imported in the UK, partly because other much worse cars were imported from Eastern Europe, particularly from former Soviet states, and partly because the expectations were not so high as in the United States.\n\nOne interesting version of the Yugo, the automatic one, is increasingly rare and estimates say that around 20 are left in use in Serbia, and most of those were sold in 1992, just after the sanctions were imposed, fetching a large value on auctions. A small number of newer Yugos can be found with automatic transmissions, and they were mostly built by request and featured a 1.3 liter engine.\n\n<!-- Because of no major changes to the body or the drive train of the car, it is very easy to pinpoint the car's year of manufacture.{{Contradict-inline|date=July 2015}} -->Early 1980-1985 models featured butterfly opening windows, round side indicators, only a single set of tail lights on each side of the car, no rear defroster, and usually a black interior with a black dashboard, and many metal trim pieces such as window crank handles and door handles. Since around 1985, the cars received more comfortable seating, a blue or brown dashboard, two-part tail lights on each side, square side signals, rear defroster, redesigned instrument cluster, and butterfly windows that did not open. In 1990, a fuel filler flap was added instead of a twist cap, and some minor interior and instrument cluster changes were implemented. In 1991, the dashboard was redesigned first for the Yugo GVX and then for the European model, side butterfly windows were removed, and a bigger tank was introduced. In 2000, the car received a new front fascia with new bumpers, rear spoiler, a redesigned dashboard, and seats. The latest changes were in 2007, with the introduction of a new instrument cluster.\n\nOne popular \"upgrade\" to older (and even new) Yugos is [[autogas]] ([[liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]) conversion which has gained widespread popularity in Serbia. Because most Yugos do not feature fuel injection, converting them to LPG is cheap and easy, and is paid off very quickly. One drawback of such conversions is that an already small trunk becomes almost useless, since an LPG tank takes up space. Such converted cars achieve better reliability since use of an unreliable gasoline pump is avoided. However, some cars have starting problems in very cold weather, because of improper LPG installation.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nThe car has achieved a symbolic status in former Yugoslavian countries due to the simplicity, reliability, and overall cheap price, and the Yugoslavian mentality of people regularly fixing their own cars instead of servicing them at their local garage. It was featured in many Yugoslavian films and TV series, and also in modern-day shows in former Yugoslavian countries. They are still very popular and are a common sight in former Yugoslavian countries (except [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Slovenia]]), and the large number of parts make it easily repairable.\n\nIn stark contrast, in the United States, the car was frequently subjected to ridicule and mockery and it has a universally negative rating. ''Car Talk'' has rated it the \"worst car of the millennium\", and many car magazines and TV shows rate it as the worst car of the 1980s and also [[List of automobiles known for negative reception|the worst car to be ever made]]. Despite the very low price setting in the US (with Yugo being the cheapest new car ever sold in the US when adjusted for inflation), it was ridiculed for the overall ugly design, poor quality, and large number of technical issues. Many American Yugos had faulty designs that were stressed in owners' manuals to be regularly serviced, but this caused even more ridicule due to owners overlooking these issues. The car has become a sort of a symbol for a [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon car]]. The car was also featured in many TV shows and films, satirizing the car's poor design (the most famous examples being a rusty, beige-colored Yugo GV featured in ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance|,]] and a taxi-yellow Yugo in ''[[Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist]]'').\n\nA Yugo was prominently featured in the 1987 feature film ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'', with actor [[Dan Aykroyd]] even mentioning the car by make and model year in a voice-over. \n\nIn the 2000 movie ''[[Drowning Mona]]'', everyone in the town of [[Verplanck, New York]] drives Yugos because in the fictional story of the film, Zastava (which in the film is falsely called the Yugo car company) chose the town for testing the car before its official launch on the US market.\n\nIn the animation film ''[[Cars 2]],'' there is a loser gang that largely consists of Yugos (called \"Hugos\" in the film) as well as [[AMC Gremlin|AMC Gremlins]] and [[AMC Pacer|AMC Pacers.]] \n\nIn an episode of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]],'' [[Jeremy Clarkson]] drives a Yugo and calls it \"a hateful, hateful car\" and its performance so bad \"you get overtaken by wildlife\". In the end, he destroys it by shooting at it with a tank.<ref>{{Citation|title=Top Gear - Zastava Yugo 45 - Jeremy Blows Up Car :(|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D3ZDGrqUBY|language=en|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>\n\nIn a later episode of Top Gear, on a visit to [[Albania]], Jeremy Clarkson drives a red Yugo as a replacement for a [[Bentley Mulsanne (1980\u201392)|Bentley Mulsanne]], as an apparent dig at [[Bentley]] for not lending them a Mulsanne for that particular shoot.

By the late 1930s, the company had expanded into automobile production supplying [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]-designed trucks to the [[Royal Yugoslav Army]]. Vehicle production continued until 1941, when [[World War II]] reached Yugoslavia. Following the war, Zastava was permitted to produce Jeeps under license from [[Willys-Overland]] until production was halted in the early 1950s.\n\nThe first passenger models were produced on 26 August 1953 using designs licensed by Fiat of [[Turin]]. The first model designed by Zastava was a sedan called the Milletrecento (\"one thousand three hundred\") powered by a 1,300 [[Cubic centimeter|cc]] engine. Some of the most successful models were those based on the [[Fiat 128]] model, marketed under different names: Zastava 101, Zastava 128, Zastava 311, Zastava Skala, etc.\n\nZastava continued to produce vehicles for the Yugoslav and European markets until exports were limited by sanctions imposed by the [[United Nations]] in the 1990s. In 1984, automobile entrepreneur Malcolm Bricklin tested the United States market for Zastava vehicles, now branded as Yugo. As a result, in mid-1986, Yugo America began selling cars at a starting price of $3,990 for the entry-level GV (\"Good Value\") hatchback equipped with the 1,100 cc overhead-cam five-main-bearing engine and four-speed manual transmission. The similar GVL offered a plusher interior, but the sporty top-line GVX was powered by the 1,300 cc engine mated to a five-speed manual transmission, and included as standard equipment a number of deluxe features such as a ground-effects package, alloy wheels, and rally lights. However, though the GVX was billed as an upscale, sporty version of the base GV, it went from 0-60&nbsp;mph in 13.56 seconds, just a half a second faster than the GV.<ref name=Vuic>{{citation | title = The Yugo: The Rise and Fall of the Worst Car in History | last = Vuic | first = Jason | page = 176 | publisher = Hill and Wang | location = New York City | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-8090-9891-0}}</ref> When the political instability in Yugoslavia intensified in early 1992, Zastava was forced to stop exports.\n\nToday, various models are available in the former Yugoslavia, including an agreement signed with Fiat for the production of the 2003 [[Fiat Punto]] model.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://english.eastday.com/eastday/englishedition/business/userobject1ai1474719.html english.eastday.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212130356/http://english.eastday.com/eastday/englishedition/business/userobject1ai1474719.html |date=2006-02-12 }}</ref>\n\n===1988\u20131991===\n[[File:Yugo Police Car.jpg|thumb|A 1990 Yugo police car in [[Croatia]]]]\nMany mechanics and even Zastava factory workers agree that the \"best\" Yugos ever were built between 1988 and early 1991. Quality control was good; high standards were set in terms of plastic quality, seat cloth, and \"a well screwed together\" interior. Paint and antirust coatings were also well done during that period, evidenced by many cars still showing no signs of rust, tears in the seats, or major engine issues after more than 20 years.\n\n1989 was considered a \"golden year\" for Yugos because almost 200,000 were built that year, and many can still be seen on the road today. Also, cars were usually branded Yugo instead of Zastava during that period, because the company was taking pride in the (at the time) good sales and reputation established in the export markets, especially in the United States.\n\nIn 1990, a batch of 450 cars with automatic transmissions and [[air conditioning]] was shipped to the United States. With political problems starting in 1991, quality dropped significantly, coming to such low standards such as plastic parts of the dashboard not fitting correctly.\n\n===1991\u20131996===\nBecause the Yugo was built as a \"Yugoslav\" car with political problems and civil war breaking out in 1990\u201391, production slowed down and the supply of parts was interrupted. Most of the plastic came from Croatia, while the alternators and electrical equipment came from Slovenia. With the start of civil war, economic and transportation ties were broken, resulting in shortage of most parts coming from the two seceded republics. Though the sanctions were not in place until May 1992, Yugos built between June 1991 and early 1996 were built with a variety of \"leftover\" parts: as an example, getting a car with a blue dashboard and a brown steering wheel, seats that were mismatched in color, and most likely an \"American\" instrument cluster with speeds printed in MPH rather than km/h, and with written labels like water and oil instead of small drawings, and a seatbelt safety warning light were possible. In some extreme cases, the car would come with different interior panels and a steering wheel from other Zastava products such as the Zastava 750. When exports to United States (and the rest of the world) stopped, a number of federalized Yugos were still left in the factory's parking lots, and many people got these \"American\" Yugos instead of the European ones. When Yugoslavia broke apart in the early 1990s, production rates steeply declined to 14,000 in 1992, 7,000 in 1993 and 1994, and 9,000 in 1995. In 1996, when sanctions were lifted, production rates slowly increased as living standards in the former Yugoslavia started to improve. Even so, problems for the factory started once again when it was put out of production in mid-1999 as a result of war with [[NATO]].\n\n===In the United States===\n{{refimprove-section|date=February 2020}}\n\nInternational Automobile Importers (IAI) was a company founded by [[Malcolm Bricklin]] to import the X1/9 and 2000 Spider after Fiat halted their manufacture.<ref>Vuic, p. 21</ref> Bertone and [[Pininfarina]] carried on production under their own names and Bricklin's IAI took over their U.S. importation. Bricklin wanted to import additional brands, and international dealmaker [[Armand Hammer]] had been asked by the Yugoslavs to identify business areas in which they could generate exports to bolster their economy. Hammer thought the idea of exporting the small cars made in [[Kragujevac]], Serbia, by Zavodi Crvena Zastava, would be viable. Zastava had, since the mid-19th century, been a quality armaments producer and sponsored its own museum.\n\nAs Zastava celebrated its 100th anniversary, it started producing vehicles made under license from the Italian company Fiat, located just across the [[Adriatic]] Sea. For three decades, Zastava produced the rear-engined 600 and the 101, a bustle-backed version of the [[Fiat 128]]. On its own initiative in 1980, Zastava introduced its Jugo or Yugo model which, though still using Fiat 128-type powertrain and other components, was in fact an update of the Fiat 127{{CN|date=February 2020}} styled in Turin.{{CN|date=February 2020}}. Zastava was already exporting its new offering to other Eastern European markets, installing the bigger 128 overhead-cam engine for a top speed of {{convert|90|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n[[File:Blue Yugo GV in San Francisco.jpg|thumb|left|Yugo GV in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]]]\n[[File:Black tuned Yugo GV.jpg|thumb|left| Yugo GV in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], Ohio]]\n[[File:Red Yugo GV in Junction Triangle, Toronto, Canada 2.jpg|thumb|Yugo GV in Junction Triangle, [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]]]]\n[[File:1987 Yugo GV.jpg|thumb|1987 Yugo GV in [[Los Angeles County, California]]]]\n[[File:Red Yugo GVX.jpg|thumb|Yugo GVX (1.3 EFI version) in [[Wausau, Wisconsin]]]]\nIn 1982, U.S. entrepreneur Miro Kefurt contacted Zastava in Kragujevac (ZCZ-Zavodi Crvena Zastava) with an idea to export the Yugo 45 to the United States.<ref>Vuic, p. 11</ref> The vehicles were to be renamed Yugo GV for the United States market and YugoCars, Inc. was formed in [[Sun Valley, California]], by Kefurt and Ray Burns. The proposal required approval by Fiat in [[Italy]] due to existing contractual restrictions in effect for Fiat\u2014Zastava collaborations.\n\nThe first three Yugo vehicles, painted red, white, and blue, were introduced to the U.S. public at the [[LA Auto Show|Los Angeles Auto Show]] in May 1984. The car was promoted with a 10-year/100,000-mile warranty, free maintenance, and a price of only $4,500. Front-page articles about the Yugo appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (Business Section), ''[[New York Times]]'', and ''[[The National Enquirer]]''. However, problems soon arose as one car was sent to the [[California Air Resources Board]] for emissions testing, which it badly failed. The Yugo needed lots of reengineering, and with no help forthcoming from Zastava, Kefurt was in a problematic situation.<ref>Vuic, p. 16</ref>\n\nReportedly, [[Malcolm Bricklin]] attended the Los Angeles Auto Show, and while the show was still in progress, flew to Yugoslavia to make a deal to import the Yugo to the United States himself. But Kefurt and YugoCars already held the exclusive import contract for 5,000 vehicles for the 1985 model year to be sold only in [[California]], and the California emissions certification was already in progress. In November 1984, the marketing rights were sold by YugoCars to International Automobile Importers (IAI) for $50,000 ($10 per car). Additionally, Miro Kefurt obtained an exclusive dealer franchise from IAI to sell the [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]] [[X1/9]] in [[North Hollywood, California]]. \n\nYugoCars had intended to fit their Yugo 45 with the 903-cc, 45-horsepower 4-cylinder engine with a 3-way [[catalytic converter]] and [[oxygen sensor]] for emissions control. Predicted gas mileage was 42 to 45 mpg at 70&nbsp;mph. In late 1983, Zastava added a version called the Yugo 55, powered by a bigger engine used in the Fiat 101/128. IAI's Tony Ciminera preferred using this larger, 1,100 cc engine making 55 horsepower, though it would drop fuel economy to the 30&nbsp;MPG range, for it was faster and more able to keep up on American freeways. Even so, with an {{convert|86|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} top speed, it was the slowest car sold in the United States.<ref>Vuic, p. 83</ref>\n\nSetting up Yugo America to import the car, Bricklin assigned Bill Prior to sort out the distribution and Tony Ciminera to fine-tune the Yugo for the American market. Ciminera carried out a bumper-to-bumper audit that resulted in more than 500 changes to meet the needs of the U.S. market, including compliance with American [[NHTSA|safety]] and [[Vehicle emissions control|emissions]] regulations. The vast Yugo facility was patterned after the Fiat factories of the early 1950s and employed 50,000, divided among 85 basic associated labor organizations and 25 work committees. For U.S. models, a separate assembly line was built with handpicked elite staff earning extra pay ($1.23 per hour extra), building Yugos destined for the New World. The first shift began at 6:00 am, and after an [[eight-hour day]], many employees left for their second jobs in other workplaces.{{CN|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe chief engineer and head of Zastava's Research and Development Institute was Zdravko Menjak, who worked with Bricklin's people at the plant to monitor the effort, constantly stressing the need for high quality. A team of British quality experts went to Kragujevac to study the factory and recommend improvements.{{CN|date=February 2020}}\n\nFive models of Yugo were sold in the United States for the 1987 model year: the basic entry-level $3,990 GV (for \"Great Value\"){{CN|date=February 2020}}, the GVC with a glass sunroof, the nearly identical GVL and GVS with minor trim and upholstery upgrades, and the GVX with the 1,300-cc engine, five-speed manual transmission, and standard equipment including a plush interior, ground-effects package, alloy wheels, and rally lights. The Cabrio [[convertible]] was introduced in 1988.\n\nIn the late 1980s, an automatic transmission was being sourced from Renault and a larger model (named the \"[[Yugo Florida|Florida]]\") had been styled by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and was in the early manufacturing stages. With the end of [[communism]], however, Yugoslavia began to unravel.\n\nBy 1990, the GV, GVL, and the 1,100-cc engine and four-speed manual transmission were replaced by a 1,300-cc [[OHC]] engine and five-speed manual transmission or a [[Renault]]-designed three-speed [[automatic transmission]], and an air conditioner with a holder for cooling two soft drink cans became optional on the GVX model.

These cars were based upon the Fiat 128 which had been voted European car of the year in 1969. The Kragujevac factory produced faithful copies of the 128 saloon, known as the Zastava 128 (Osmica) and then from 1971 also began production of the Zastava 101. The legendary \u201cStojadin\u201d was a Fiat 128 with a redesigned rear which was available in three- and five-door hatchback versions. In 1982\u20131983, as sales slowly improved, Zastava Cars Limited introduced special trim levels in the form of the \u201cMediterranean\u201d and the \u201cCaribbean\u201d. The United Kingdom market was the only market catered for right-hand drive versions.\n\nBy the time the first British users were adjusting to their new Yugoslav machines, attention in Yugoslavia had moved away from the Stojadin towards the new \u201cYugo\u201d series which began production in October 1980 and appeared on British roads from 1983 onwards. The \u201cType 102\u201d answered a call for a small, economical family car and was based mechanically on Fiat\u2019s 127 hatchback. The styling of the car also owed much to the contemporary small Italian [[Autobianchi]] [[Abarth]], which was never available in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe \u201cType 102\u201d morphed into the early production Yugo 45 with a 903 cc engine, later into the 55 with a 1,116 cc engine and then the more powerful 65 fitted with a 1,301 cc engine also became available in the British market. The new Yugo competed with indigenous cars such as the [[Austin Metro|Austin Mini-Metro]] and [[Ford Fiesta (first generation)|Ford Fiesta MK1]]/[[Ford Fiesta (second generation)|MK2]], captive imports such as the [[Vauxhall Nova]] ([[Opel Corsa]] A), and French models like the [[Citro\u00ebn Visa]] and [[Talbot Samba]].\n\nIn 1984 only, Zastava (GB) LTD imported small numbers of the Zastava 128. After that, with the company\u2019s branding altered to \u201cYugo Cars\u201d, relegating the Zastava name to the small print, Zastava (GB) LTD concentrated on selling the 101 range, branded as Yugo 311/313/511/513, and the 45/55/65 series. The cars sold steadily throughout the decade, and though they managed to avoid the dreadful reviews reserved for Lada and FSO, commentators in the British motoring press were rarely more than lukewarm in their praise of the car - a headline from 1986 read \u201cThe Yugo 55 is a good small car, but would you be seen in one?\u201d\n\nIn 1988, Zastava launched the first of its new \u201cFlorida\u201d range, envisaged as a long-term replacement for the ageing Stojadin. Styled by Giorgetto Guigiaro, the car was a modern design for the time, and bore more than a passing resemblance to the [[Citro\u00ebn ZX]]. The Florida, marketed as the \u201cSana\u201d in the United Kingdom, first appeared in Britain in 1990<ref>Vuic, p. 68</ref> and seemed set to fare well with positive early reviews. The Stojadin range ceased to be exported to the United Kingdom in 1991, with sales of the Sana under way.\n\nBy the end of the 1980s, Yugoslavia was on the brink of a disintegration that many anticipated under the leadership of [[Josip Broz Tito]]. Slovenia was the first to secede from the federation in the middle of 1991, swiftly followed by Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and finally Macedonia. Hostilities, other than in Macedonia, began not long afterwards.\n\nThis had direct implications for the company at Kragujevac. The Yugo had been envisaged as an all-Yugoslav car; the alternator came from Slovenia, the plastics and the interior from factories in Croatia, and the seats and rear trunk-struts from Serbia via Kosovo. The disintegration of the Yugoslav federation suddenly had supplies dry up at Kragujevac and production rates declined steeply. The Sana may well have established Yugo as a fixture in the United Kingdom market in the 1990s, but political developments left this prospect unrealized.\n\n[[File:White Zastava Koral In during the Belgrade Car Show.jpg|thumb|Late-model Zastava Koral at a Belgrade Car Show]]\nAs the events of the wars of Yugoslav succession (1991\u201395 and 1999) unfolded, Zastava (GB) LTD became a barely noticed casualty. During Easter 1999, the Zastava factory in Kragujevac was targeted by NATO forces during the [[Kosovo]] campaign, and whilst severely damaged, was not put out of action. Supplies of vehicles to the United Kingdom were, however, reduced to a trickle in 1991 and 1992 and with the imposition of United Nations sanctions on [[Slobodan Milosevi\u0107]]'s rump Yugoslavia (consisting of Serbia and Montenegro), the company folded in 1993. The remaining Yugos on dealer forecourts were sold at drastically reduced prices or written off altogether as economically unviable.\n\n====Marketing====\nThe Yugo was vigorously marketed in the late 1980s as a car that would fit into everybody's life, providing basic economical and reliable transportation along the lines of the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and the earlier [[Ford]] [[Model T]]. The car was promoted as a uniquely affordable new vehicle&nbsp;\u2014 providing an option for buyers who would otherwise have chosen a used vehicle&nbsp;\u2014 and as a reliable second car for wealthier buyers. The Yugo carried the tagline \"Everybody Needs A Yugo Sometime.\"<ref>{{YouTube|VV9NOBYDC4|Yugo}}</ref> This marketing appealed successfully to its target market of low-budget new car buyers, as well as wealthier people looking for an affordable second or third car.<ref>PETERS, E (2004): ''Automotive Atrocities: The Cars We Love to Hate''. Motorbooks International.</ref> A popular ad included the 39-90 campaign, a play on the $3,990 price of the car.\n\n==Criticism and response==\nAlong with other Central and Eastern European vehicles marketed in the West during the 20th century&nbsp;\u2014 such as the [[\u0160koda Auto|\u0160koda]] \u2014 the Yugo was subjected to derision by critics who pointed to its use of old-generation Fiat technology and to alleged issues with build quality and reliability.

However, in an interference engine, failure of the timing belt disrupts the synchronization between pistons and [[poppet valve]]s, causing them to collide with one another (hence the name interference engine), thus potentially destroying the engine. Though this requirement was stressed in owners' manuals, it was frequently overlooked by owners. The factory also stressed the need for 89-octane fuels for the low-compression engines.\n\nSome Yugo owners have reported that regular oil changes and appropriate maintenance allow the cars to remain dependable and trouble-free.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inet.hr/~bpauric/eindex.htm |title=YUGO CARS.Web - English |publisher=Inet.hr |accessdate=2010-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614220936/http://www.inet.hr/~bpauric/eindex.htm |archive-date=2011-06-14 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, 31-year-old Leslie Ann Pluhar, driving a 1987 Yugo over the [[Mackinac Bridge]] in Michigan, died when her Yugo went over the bridge's {{convert|36|in|mm|adj=on}} railing during {{convert|50|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} winds.

Also, the simplicity of the car's engine makes it easy to fix, and many Yugoslavian owners tended to fix the car themselves.

While presenters Richard Hammond and James May drove the very new Mercedes and Rolls Royce, respectively, Clarkson was originally supposed to drive the very new Bentley- so he had to drive the Yugo. In addition to Clarkson calling the Yugo \"the least refined car I've ever driven\", it was lambasted constantly, at one point overheated and failed to start, thoroughly physically trashed, and then driven off a cliff and destroyed while May was driving it to simulate a mock death for May after a staged police chase through Albania. In one segment in that episode, they attempted to put an obese Albanian man playing dead (sticking with their theme of which car they thought would be best for the Albanian Mafia) into the boot (trunk) of their cars. Surprisingly, the Yugo was the only successful car at this challenge, although the \"dead\" man was very visible in the car. It was also featured in one of Clarkson's motoring programs in the 1990s called ''Jeremy Clarkson: Unleashed on Cars''. He drove the Yugo, and after lambasting its performance, styling, and build quality, he then blew it up with a tank gun, and ran it over and crushed it with that same tank, totally destroying the car and reducing it to scrap metal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHmas6JXVi8|title=Jeremy Clarkson destroying Yugo 45 & Volvo|last=Du\u0161an Eremi\u0107|date=10 May 2008|via=YouTube|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925183002/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHmas6JXVi8|archive-date=2015-09-25|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==End of production==\nWith the 794,428th and final car, production ended on November 11, 2008.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fawkes |first=Helen |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7739319.stm |title=Europe &#124; Yugo production grinds to a halt |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-11-20 |accessdate=2009-07-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201105247/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7739319.stm |archive-date=2009-02-01 |url-status=live }}</ref>\nOf that number, around 250,000 were exported to various countries.\n\n==Today==\nYears after its demise, the Yugo is still a common sight in Serbia, with almost 60,000 vehicles still in use,{{when|date=October 2015}} most of which were built in the 2000s. Parts are still readily available at most auto-parts stores and in scrapyards across the country. However, Yugos are rare in other Yugoslav republics, particularly in Slovenia, because most of them were \"imported\" back to Serbia in the early 2000s, most likely because most of them were in good shape for their age.\n\nIn the United States, few Yugos are left in service, likely because of international sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, which limited the supply of spare parts and service locations. The United Kingdom has around 100 Yugos still in existence and an owners club has been created. Unlike in the United States, the Yugo was never considered to be one of the worst cars ever imported in the UK, partly because other much worse cars were imported from Eastern Europe, particularly from former Soviet states, and partly because the expectations were not so high as in the United States.\n\nOne interesting version of the Yugo, the automatic one, is increasingly rare and estimates say that around 20 are left in use in Serbia, and most of those were sold in 1992, just after the sanctions were imposed, fetching a large value on auctions. A small number of newer Yugos can be found with automatic transmissions, and they were mostly built by request and featured a 1.3 liter engine.\n\n<!-- Because of no major changes to the body or the drive train of the car, it is very easy to pinpoint the car's year of manufacture.{{Contradict-inline|date=July 2015}} -->Early 1980-1985 models featured butterfly opening windows, round side indicators, only a single set of tail lights on each side of the car, no rear defroster, and usually a black interior with a black dashboard, and many metal trim pieces such as window crank handles and door handles. Since around 1985, the cars received more comfortable seating, a blue or brown dashboard, two-part tail lights on each side, square side signals, rear defroster, redesigned instrument cluster, and butterfly windows that did not open. In 1990, a fuel filler flap was added instead of a twist cap, and some minor interior and instrument cluster changes were implemented. In 1991, the dashboard was redesigned first for the Yugo GVX and then for the European model, side butterfly windows were removed, and a bigger tank was introduced. In 2000, the car received a new front fascia with new bumpers, rear spoiler, a redesigned dashboard, and seats. The latest changes were in 2007, with the introduction of a new instrument cluster.\n\nOne popular \"upgrade\" to older (and even new) Yugos is [[autogas]] ([[liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]) conversion which has gained widespread popularity in Serbia. Because most Yugos do not feature fuel injection, converting them to LPG is cheap and easy, and is paid off very quickly. One drawback of such conversions is that an already small trunk becomes almost useless, since an LPG tank takes up space. Such converted cars achieve better reliability since use of an unreliable gasoline pump is avoided. However, some cars have starting problems in very cold weather, because of improper LPG installation.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nThe car has achieved a symbolic status in former Yugoslavian countries due to the simplicity, reliability, and overall cheap price, and the Yugoslavian mentality of people regularly fixing their own cars instead of servicing them at their local garage. It was featured in many Yugoslavian films and TV series, and also in modern-day shows in former Yugoslavian countries. They are still very popular and are a common sight in former Yugoslavian countries (except [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Slovenia]]), and the large number of parts make it easily repairable.\n\nIn stark contrast, in the United States, the car was frequently subjected to ridicule and mockery and it has a universally negative rating. ''Car Talk'' has rated it the \"worst car of the millennium\", and many car magazines and TV shows rate it as the worst car of the 1980s and also [[List of automobiles known for negative reception|the worst car to be ever made]]. Despite the very low price setting in the US (with Yugo being the cheapest new car ever sold in the US when adjusted for inflation), it was ridiculed for the overall ugly design, poor quality, and large number of technical issues. Many American Yugos had faulty designs that were stressed in owners' manuals to be regularly serviced, but this caused even more ridicule due to owners overlooking these issues. The car has become a sort of a symbol for a [[Lemon (automobile)|lemon car]]. The car was also featured in many TV shows and films, satirizing the car's poor design (the most famous examples being a rusty, beige-colored Yugo GV featured in ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance|,]] and a taxi-yellow Yugo in ''[[Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist]]'').\n\nA Yugo was prominently featured in the 1987 feature film ''[[Dragnet (1987 film)|Dragnet]]'', with actor [[Dan Aykroyd]] even mentioning the car by make and model year in a voice-over. \n\nIn the 2000 movie ''[[Drowning Mona]]'', everyone in the town of [[Verplanck, New York]] drives Yugos because in the fictional story of the film, Zastava (which in the film is falsely called the Yugo car company) chose the town for testing the car before its official launch on the US market.\n\nIn the animation film ''[[Cars 2]],'' there is a loser gang that largely consists of Yugos (called \"Hugos\" in the film) as well as [[AMC Gremlin|AMC Gremlins]] and [[AMC Pacer|AMC Pacers.]] \n\nIn an episode of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]],'' [[Jeremy Clarkson]] drives a Yugo and calls it \"a hateful, hateful car\" and its performance so bad \"you get overtaken by wildlife\". In the end, he destroys it by shooting at it with a tank.<ref>{{Citation|title=Top Gear - Zastava Yugo 45 - Jeremy Blows Up Car :(|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D3ZDGrqUBY|language=en|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>\n\nIn a later episode of Top Gear, on a visit to [[Albania]], Jeremy Clarkson drives a red Yugo as a replacement for a [[Bentley Mulsanne (1980\u201392)|Bentley Mulsanne]], as an apparent dig at [[Bentley]] for not lending them a Mulsanne for that particular shoot. It was used as a joke car in comparison to [[Richard Hammond]]'s [[Mercedes S-Class]] and [[James May]]'s [[Rolls Royce Ghost]]. After a [[police]] chase after a supposed [[bank robbery]], [[James May]] decides to drive the Yugo off a cliff, rather than fall into police custody. <ref>{{Citation|title=Top Gear - Albanian Police Chase - James Drives Yugo Off Cliff :(|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OA9mA176mA|language=en|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref>\n\nA Yugo is also prominently featured in the music video for the 2008 song ''[[The Day That Never Comes]]'' by [[Metallica]].\n\nIn the 1999 film ''[[Bowfinger]]'' a poster in movie producer Bobby Bowfinger's office advertises his fictional film ''The Yugo Story''.\n\nIn the 2011 film ''[[Good Luck Charlie, It's Christmas!]]'', Teddy and Amy Duncan rent a Yugo for $50. Amy describes the car as \"10 years older than [Teddy],\" and \"made in a country that no longer exists.\"\n\nIn the 2018 animated film ''[[Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse]]'', a fictional modern version of the Yugo is advertised in [[Times Square]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Torchinsky |first1=Jason |title=The Most Important Thing About The New Spider-Man Trailer Is That There's A New Yugo |url=https://jalopnik.com/the-most-important-thing-to-know-about-the-new-spiderma-1826612642 |website=Jalopnik |accessdate=21 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nA Yugo was used and appears in [[Mura Masa]]'s song ''Deal Wiv It.''\n\n==See also==\n* [[Zastava Florida]] (also known as Yugo Sana)\n* [[Zastava Skala]] (also known as Zastava 101)\n* [[Zastava 10]]\n* [[Zastava 750]]\n* [[List of automobiles considered the worst]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Sources===\n* [[Georgano, G.N.]] (1985): ''The complete encyclopaedia of motorcars: 1885 to present''.
