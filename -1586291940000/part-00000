Additionally, Elkj\u00e6r scored nearly 40 goals for the [[Denmark national football team|Danish national team]] in 11 years, being a leading figure for the Danish side under coach [[Sepp Piontek]] that played at the [[UEFA Euro 1984|Euro 1984]] and the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] (a first-ever appearance), often hailed as the golden generation of [[Danish football]] by their countrymen. Elkj\u00e6r won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Bronze Ball]] award at the latter competition.  \n \nWidely regarded as one of the best forwards of the 1980s, Elkj\u00e6r finished second in the [[Ballon d'Or]] awards in 1985, having been placed third the previous year, and going on to finish fourth in [[1986 Ballon d'Or|1986]]. In [[Verona]] he is still remembered fondly, having earned the persisting nickname \"Il sindaco\" (the mayor) during his stint for the club. To this day, at least a few hundred voters in the city continue to write his name on their ballots at the mayoral elections.  Renowned for his goal-scoring abilities and persona, he also remains one of the most popular athletes in his native Denmark.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Germany/Belgium===\nBorn September 11, 1957, in [[Copenhagen]], Elkj\u00e6r's career started with [[Vanl\u00f8se IF]] in 1976, where he stayed for just one season, playing 15 games and scoring seven goals. He then joined [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]] in [[Germany]], at the time one of [[Europe]]'s leading clubs.

One falling out with the coach [[Hennes Weisweiler]] earned a legendary status in Denmark: Weisweiler approached Elkj\u00e6r and said that he had been informed that the player had spent the night at a nightclub in the company of a bottle of [[whiskey]] and a lady, and wanted to know if that was true.

{"title_page": "Solar water disinfection", "text_new": "[[File:Indonesia-sodis-gross.jpg|thumb|right|SODIS application in [[Indonesia]] using clear PET plastic beverage bottles]]\n'''Solar water disinfection''', in short '''SODIS''', is a type of [[portable water purification]] that uses [[solar energy]] to make biologically-contaminated (e.g. bacteria, viruses, protozoa and worms) water safe to drink. Water contaminated with non-biological agents such as toxic chemicals or heavy metals require additional steps to make the water safe to drink.\n\nSolar water disinfection is usually accomplished using some mix of electricity generated by [[photovoltaics]] panels (solar PV), heat ([[solar thermal]]), and solar [[ultraviolet light]] collection.\n\nSolar disinfection using the effects of electricity generated by photovoltaics typically uses an electric current to deliver electrolytic processes which disinfect water, for example by generating oxidative free radicals which kill pathogens by damaging their chemical structure. A second approach uses stored solar electricity from a battery, and operates at night or at low light levels to power an ultraviolet lamp to perform secondary solar ultraviolet water disinfection.\n\nSolar thermal water disinfection uses heat from the sun to heat water to 70\u2013100&nbsp;\u00b0C for a short period of time. A number of approaches exist. Solar heat collectors can have lenses in front of them, or use reflectors. They may also use varying levels of insulation or glazing. In addition, some solar thermal water disinfection processes are batch-based, while others (through-flow solar thermal disinfection) operate almost continuously while the sun shines. Water heated to temperatures below 100&nbsp;\u00b0C is generally referred to as [[pasteurized]] water.\n\nThe ultraviolet part of sunlight can also kill pathogens in water. The SODIS method uses a combination of UV light and increased temperature (solar thermal) for [[disinfection|disinfecting]] water using only [[sunlight]] and [[repurposing|repurposed]] [[polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] plastic bottles. SODIS is a free and effective method for decentralized [[water treatment]], usually applied at the household level and is recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage.<ref name=\"AutoSB-1\" /><!-- \"exposing to the UV radiation in sunlight\", \"solar disinfection\" --> SODIS is already applied in numerous [[developing countries]].<ref name=\"TrainingEN\" />{{rp|55}} Educational pamphlets on the method are available in many languages,<ref name=\"Training\" /> each equivalent to the English-language version.<ref name=\"TrainingEN\" />\n\n== Principle ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nExposure to sunlight has been shown{{by whom|date=May 2019}} to deactivate [[diarrhea]]-causing organisms in polluted [[drinking water]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} The inactivation of pathogenic organisms is attributed to: the [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-A (wavelength 320\u2013400&nbsp;nm) part of the sunlight, which reacts with oxygen dissolved in the water and produces highly reactive forms of oxygen (oxygen free radicals and [[hydrogen peroxide]]s) that damage pathogens, while it also interferes with metabolism and destroys  bacterial cell structures; and simultaneously the full band of solar energy (from [[infrared radiation|infrared]] to UV) heats the water.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Kara L.|last2=Fisher|first2=Michael B.|date=2014-02-01|title=Inactivation of Escherichia coli by Polychromatic Simulated Sunlight: Evidence for and Implications of a Fenton Mechanism Involving Iron, Hydrogen Peroxide, and Superoxide|journal=Appl.

Above {{convert|50|C|abbr=on}}, the bacterial count drops three times faster.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n== Process for household application ==\n[[File:Pictograms SODIS.jpg|thumb|SODIS instructions for using solar water disinfection]]\nGuides for the household use of SODIS describe the process.\n\nColourless, transparent [[polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] water or soda bottles of 2 litre or smaller size with few surface scratches are selected for use.  Glass bottles are also  suitable.  Any labels are removed and the bottles are washed before the first use. Water from possibly-contaminated sources is filled into the bottles, using the clearest water possible.  Where the [[turbidity]] is higher than 30 [[Nephelometric Turbidity Unit|NTU]] it is necessary to filter or [[flocculation|precipitate out]] [[particulates]] prior to exposure to the sunlight. \nFilters are locally made from cloth stretched over inverted bottles with the bottoms cut off. In order to improve oxygen saturation, the guides recommend that bottles be filled three-quarters, shaken for 20 seconds (with the cap on), then filled completely, recapped, and checked for clarity.\n\n[[File:Image-Metal-reflectance.png|thumb|Aluminum reflects ultraviolet well]] \nThe filled bottles are then exposed to the fullest sunlight possible. Bottles will heat faster and hotter if they are placed on a sloped Sun-facing reflective metal surface. A corrugated metal roof (as compared to thatched roof) or a slightly curved sheet of aluminum foil increases the light inside the bottle. Overhanging structures or plants that shade the bottles must be avoided, as they reduce both illumination and heating. After sufficient time, the treated water can be consumed directly from the bottle or poured into clean drinking cups. The risk of re-contamination is minimized if the water is stored in the bottles. Refilling and storage in other containers increases the risk of contamination.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Suggested treatment schedule<ref name=\"AutoSB-2\" />\n|-\n! Weather conditions\n!

Applying SODIS without proper assessment (or with false assessment) of existing hygienic practices & diarrhea incidence may not address other routes of infection. Community trainers must themselves be trained first.<ref name=\"TrainingEN\" />\n\n== Applications ==\nSODIS is an effective method for treating water where fuel or cookers are unavailable or prohibitively expensive. Even where fuel is available, SODIS is a more economical and environmentally friendly option. The application of SODIS is limited if enough bottles are not available, or if the water is highly [[turbid]].  In fact, if the water is highly turbid, SODIS cannot be used alone;  additional filtering is then necessary.<ref name=\"AutoSB-3\" />\n\nA basic field test to determine if the water is too turbid for the SODIS method to work properly is the newspaper test.<ref name=\"Training\" /> For the newspaper test the user has to place the filled bottle upright on top of a newspaper headline and look down through the bottle opening. If the letters of the headline are readable, the water can be used for the SODIS method. If the letters are not readable then the turbidity of the water likely exceeds 30 NTU, and the water must be pretreated.\n\nIn theory, the method could be used in disaster relief or refugee camps. However, supplying bottles may be more difficult than providing equivalent disinfecting tablets containing chlorine, bromine, or iodine. In addition, in some circumstances, it may be difficult to guarantee that the water will be left in the sun for the necessary time.\n\nOther methods for household water treatment and safe storage exist (e.g., chlorination) different filtration procedures or flocculation/disinfection. The selection of the adequate method should be based on the criteria of effectiveness, the co-occurrence of other types of pollution (turbidity, chemical pollutants), treatment costs, labor input and convenience, and the user's preference.\n\nWhen the water is highly turbid, SODIS cannot be used alone;  additional filtering or flocculation is then necessary to clarify the water prior to SODIS treatment.<ref name=\"AutoSB-21\" /><ref name=\"Scaling\" /> Recent work has shown that common table salt (NaCl) is an effective flocculation agent for decreasing turbidity for the SODIS method in some types of soil.<ref name=\"AutoSB-22\" /> This method could be used to increase the geographic areas for which the SODIS method could be used as regions with highly turbid water could be treated for low costs.<ref>B.

SODIS bags have been found to yield as much as 74% higher treatment efficiencies than SODIS bottles, which may be because the bags are able to reach elevated temperatures that cause accelerated treatment.<ref name=\"Pierik\" /> SODIS bags with a water layer of approximately 1&nbsp;cm to 6&nbsp;cm reach higher temperatures more easily than SODIS bottles, and treat Vibrio cholerae more effectively.<ref name=\"Pierik\" />  It is assumed this is because of the improved surface area to volume ratio in SODIS bags. In remote regions plastic bottles are not locally available and need to be shipped in from urban centers which may be expensive and inefficient since bottles cannot be packed very tightly. Bags can be packed more densely than bottles, and can be shipped at lower cost, representing an economically preferable alternative to SODIS bottles in remote communities. The disadvantages of using bags are that they can give the water a plastic smell, they are more difficult to handle when filled with water, and they typically require that the water be transferred to a second container for drinking.\n\nAnother important benefit in using the SODIS bottles as opposed to the bags or other methods requiring the water to be transferred to a smaller container for consumption is that the bottles are a point-of-use household water treatment method.<ref name=\"Mintz\" /> Point-of-use means that the water is treated in the same easy to handle container it will be served from, thus decreasing the risk of secondary water contamination.\n\n== Cautions ==\n[[File:U+2673 DejaVu Sans.svg|thumb|The PET recycling mark shows that a bottle is made from polyethylene terephthalate, making it suitable for solar water disinfection<ref name=\"AutoSB-4\" />]]\n\nIf the water bottles are not left in the sun for the proper length of time, the water may not be safe to drink and could cause illness. If the sunlight is less strong, due to overcast weather or a less sunny climate, a longer exposure time in the sun is necessary.\n\nThe following issues should also be considered:\n\n; Bottle material: Some glass or PVC materials may prevent ultraviolet light from reaching the water.<ref name=\"AutoSB-5\" /> Commercially available bottles made of [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] are recommended. The handling is much more convenient in the case of PET bottles. [[Polycarbonate]] (resin identification code 7) blocks all UVA and UVB rays, and therefore should not be used. Bottles that are clear are to be preferred over bottles that have been colored, for example green lemon/lime soda pop bottles.\n; Aging of plastic bottles: SODIS efficiency depends on the physical condition of the plastic bottles, with scratches and other signs of wear reducing the efficiency of SODIS. Heavily scratched or old, blind bottles should be replaced.\n; Shape of containers: The intensity of the UV radiation decreases rapidly with increasing water depth. At a water depth of 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;inches) and moderate turbidity of 26 NTU, UV-A radiation is reduced to 50%. PET soft drink bottles are often easily available and thus most practical for the SODIS application.\n; Oxygen: Sunlight produces highly reactive forms of oxygen (oxygen free radicals and hydrogen peroxides) in the water. These reactive molecules contribute in the destruction process of the microorganisms. Under normal conditions (rivers, creeks, wells, ponds, tap) water contains sufficient oxygen (more than 3&nbsp;mg/L of oxygen) and does not have to be aerated before the application of SODIS.\n; Leaching of bottle material: There has been some concern over the question of whether plastic drinking containers can release chemicals or toxic components into water, a process possibly accelerated by heat. The [[Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research]] have examined the diffusion of [[adipate]]s and [[phthalates]] (DEHA and [[DEHP]]) from new and reused PET-bottles in the water during solar exposure. The levels of concentrations found in the water after a solar exposure of 17 hours in {{convert|60|C|abbr=on|adj=on}} water were far below [[World Health Organization|WHO]] guidelines for drinking water and in the same magnitude as the concentrations of phthalate and adipate generally found in high-quality tap water. Concerns about the general use of PET-bottles were also expressed after a report published by researchers from the [[University of Heidelberg]] on the release of [[Polyethylene terephthalate#Antimony|antimony]] from PET-bottles for soft drinks and mineral water stored over several months in supermarkets. However, the antimony concentrations found in the bottles are orders of magnitude below WHO<ref name=\"AutoSB-6\" />  and national guidelines for antimony concentrations in drinking water.<ref name=\"AutoSB-7\" /><ref name=\"AutoSB-8\" /><ref name=\"AutoSB-9\" />  Furthermore, SODIS water is not stored over such extended periods in the bottles.\n; Regrowth of bacteria: Once removed from sunlight, remaining bacteria may again reproduce in the dark. A 2010 study showed that adding just 10 parts per million of hydrogen peroxide is effective in preventing the regrowth of wild [[Salmonella]].<ref name=\"AutoSB-10\" />\n; Toxic chemicals: Solar water disinfection does not remove [[toxic]] chemicals that may be present in the water, such as factory waste.\n\n== Health impact, diarrhea reduction ==\n[[File:Mwamongu water source.jpg|thumb|Only forty-six percent of people in Africa have safe drinking water]]\n\nAccording to the [[World Health Organization]], more than two million people per year die of preventable water-borne diseases, and one billion people lack access to a source of improved drinking water.<ref name=\"AutoSB-19\" /><ref name=\"AutoSB-20\" />\n\nIt has been shown that the SODIS method (and other methods of household water treatment) can very effectively remove pathogenic contamination from the water. However, infectious diseases are also transmitted through other pathways, i.e. due to a general lack of sanitation and hygiene. Studies on the reduction of diarrhea among SODIS users show reduction values of 30\u201380%.<ref name=\"AutoSB-11\" /><ref name=\"AutoSB-12\" /><ref name=\"AutoSB-13\" /><ref name=\"AutoSB-14\" />\n\n==Research==\nThe effectiveness of the SODIS was first discovered by Aftim Acra, of the [[American University of Beirut]] in the early 1980s. Follow-up was conducted by the research groups of [[Martin Wegelin]] at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology]] (EAWAG) and [[Kevin McGuigan]] at the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]]. Clinical control trials were pioneered by Ronan Conroy of the RCSI team in collaboration with [[Michael Elmore-Meegan]].[[ICROSS]]\n\nA joint research project on SODIS was implemented by the following institutions:\n* [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] (RCSI), Ireland (coordination)\n* [[University of Ulster]] (UU), [[United Kingdom]]\n* CSIR Environmentek, South Africa, EAWAG, Switzerland\n* The [[Institute of Water and Sanitation Development]] ([[IWSD]]), Zimbabwe\n* [[Plataforma Solar de Almer\u00eda]] (CIEMAT-PSA), Spain\n* [[University of Leicester]] (UL), United Kingdom\n* The [[International Commission for the Relief of Suffering and Starvation]] ([[ICROSS]]), Kenya\n* [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] (USC), Spain\n* [[Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology]] (Eawag), Switzerland\n\nThe project embarked on a multi-country study including study areas in [[Zimbabwe]], [[South Africa]] and [[Kenya]].\n\nOther developments include the development of a continuous flow disinfection unit<ref name=\"pmid14766599\" /> and solar disinfection with titanium dioxide film over glass cylinders, which prevents the bacterial regrowth of [[Coliform bacteria|coliforms]] after SODIS.<ref name=\"pmid16949121\" />\n\nResearch has shown that a number of low-cost additives are capable of accelerating SODIS and that additives might make SODIS more rapid and effective in both sunny and cloudy weather, developments that could help make the technology more effective and acceptable to users.<ref name=\"pmid17998606\" />  A 2008 study showed that powdered seeds of five natural legumes (peas, beans and lentils)\u2014''[[cowpea|Vigna unguiculata]]'' (cowpea), ''[[urad (bean)|Phaseolus mungo]]'' (black lentil), ''[[soybean|Glycine max]]'' (soybean), ''[[pea|Pisum sativum]]'' (green pea), and ''[[Arachis hypogaea]]'' (peanut)\u2014when evaluated as natural flocculants for the removal of turbidity, were as effective as commercial alum and even superior for clarification in that the optimum dosage was low (1&nbsp;g/L), flocculation was rapid (7\u201325 minutes, depending on the seed used) and the water hardness and pH was essentially unaltered.<ref name=\"pmid18348392\" /> Later studies have used [[chestnuts]], [[oak]] acorns, and ''[[Moringa oleifera]]'' (drumstick tree) for the same purpose.<ref name=\"AutoSB-15\" /><ref name=\"AutoSB-16\" />\n\nOther research has examined the use of doped semiconductors to increase the production of oxygen radicals under solar UV-A.<ref name=\"AutoSB-17\" /> Recently, researchers at the [[National Centre for Sensor Research]] and the [[Biomedical Diagnostics Institute]] at [[Dublin City University]] have developed an inexpensive printable UV dosimeter for SODIS applications that can be read using a mobile phone.<ref name=\"AutoSB-18\" /> The camera of the phone is used to acquire an image of the sensor and custom software running on the phone analyses the sensor colour to provide a quantitative measurement of UV dose.\n\nIn isolated regions the effect of wood smoke increases lung disease, due to the constant need for building fires to boil water and cook. Research groups have found that boiling of water is neglected due to the difficulty of gathering wood, which is scarce in many areas. When presented with basic household water treatment options residents in isolated regions in Africa have shown a preference for the SODIS method over boiling or other basic water treatment methods.\n\nA very simple solar water purifier for rural households has been developed which uses 4 layers of saree cloth and solar tubular collectors to remove all coliforms.<ref>[https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/115/01/0032.pdf   Low-cost solar water purifier for rural households.

Villagers there using the SODIS method have been quite successful, since the temperature during the day can go beyond {{convert|40|C|abbr=on}} and there is a limited amount of shade.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nOne of the most important things to consider for public health workers reaching out to communities in need of suitable, cost efficient, and sustainable water treatment methods is teaching the importance of water quality in the context of health promotion and disease prevention while educating about the methods themselves. Although skepticism has posed a challenge in some communities to adopt SODIS and other household water treatment methods for daily use, disseminating knowledge on the important health benefits associated with these methods will likely increase adoption rates.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Appropriate technology]]\n* [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]]\n* [[Water Pasteurization Indicator]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"AutoSB-1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/household_water/research/technologies_intro/en/ |work=Household water treatment and safe storage |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |title=WHO &#124; Treatment technologies|accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Training\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sodis.ch/methode/anwendung/ausbildungsmaterial/index_EN |title=Training material |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Environmental Science and Technology (EAWAG) Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries (SANDEC) |accessdate=1 February 2010 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TrainingEN\">{{cite book |title=Solar water disinfection&nbsp;\u2014 A guide for the application of SODIS |vauthors=Meierhofer R, Wegelin M |date=October 2002 |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Environmental Science and Technology (EAWAG) Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries (SANDEC) |isbn=978-3-906484-24-2 |url=http://www.sodis.ch/methode/anwendung/ausbildungsmaterial/dokumente_material/manual_e.pdf}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoSB-2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sodis.ch/Text2002/T-Howdoesitwork.htm |title=How does it work?

Water contaminated with non-biological agents such as toxic chemicals or heavy metals require additional steps to make the water safe to drink.\n\nSolar water disinfection is usually accomplished using some mix of electricity generated by [[photovoltaics]] panels (solar PV), heat ([[solar thermal]]), and solar [[ultraviolet light]] collection.\n\nSolar disinfection using the effects of electricity generated by photovoltaics typically uses an electric current to deliver electrolytic processes which disinfect water, for example by generating oxidative free radicals which kill pathogens by damaging their chemical structure. A second approach uses stored solar electricity from a battery, and operates at night or at low light levels to power an ultraviolet lamp to perform secondary solar ultraviolet water disinfection.\n\nSolar thermal water disinfection uses heat from the sun to heat water to 70\u2013100&nbsp;\u00b0C for a short period of time. A number of approaches exist. Solar heat collectors can have lenses in front of them, or use reflectors. They may also use varying levels of insulation or glazing. In addition, some solar thermal water disinfection processes are batch-based, while others (through-flow solar thermal disinfection) operate almost continuously while the sun shines. Water heated to temperatures below 100&nbsp;\u00b0C is generally referred to as [[pasteurized]] water.\n\nThe ultraviolet part of sunlight can also kill pathogens in water. The SODIS method uses a combination of UV light and increased temperature (solar thermal) for [[disinfection|disinfecting]] water using only [[sunlight]] and [[repurposing|repurposed]] [[polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] plastic bottles. SODIS is a free and effective method for decentralized [[water treatment]], usually applied at the household level and is recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] as a viable method for household water treatment and safe storage.<ref name=\"AutoSB-1\" /><!-- \"exposing to the UV radiation in sunlight\", \"solar disinfection\" --> SODIS is already applied in numerous [[developing countries]].<ref name=\"TrainingEN\" />{{rp|55}} Educational pamphlets on the method are available in many languages,<ref name=\"Training\" /> each equivalent to the English-language version.<ref name=\"TrainingEN\" />\n\n== Principle ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nExposure to sunlight has been shown{{by whom|date=May 2019}} to deactivate [[diarrhea]]-causing organisms in polluted [[drinking water]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} The inactivation of pathogenic organisms is attributed to: the [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-A (wavelength 320\u2013400&nbsp;nm) part of the sunlight, which reacts with oxygen dissolved in the water and produces highly reactive forms of oxygen (oxygen free radicals and [[hydrogen peroxide]]s) that damage pathogens, while it also interferes with metabolism and destroys  bacterial cell structures; and simultaneously the full band of solar energy (from [[infrared radiation|infrared]] to UV) heats the water.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Kara L.|last2=Fisher|first2=Michael B.|date=2014-02-01|title=Inactivation of Escherichia coli by Polychromatic Simulated Sunlight: Evidence for and Implications of a Fenton Mechanism Involving Iron, Hydrogen Peroxide, and Superoxide|journal=Appl.

In order to improve oxygen saturation, the guides recommend that bottles be filled three-quarters, shaken for 20 seconds (with the cap on), then filled completely, recapped, and checked for clarity.\n\n[[File:Image-Metal-reflectance.png|thumb|Aluminum reflects ultraviolet well]] \nThe filled bottles are then exposed to the fullest sunlight possible. Bottles will heat faster and hotter if they are placed on a sloped Sun-facing reflective metal surface. A corrugated metal roof (as compared to thatched roof) or a slightly curved sheet of aluminum foil increases the light inside the bottle. Overhanging structures or plants that shade the bottles must be avoided, as they reduce both illumination and heating. After sufficient time, the treated water can be consumed directly from the bottle or poured into clean drinking cups. The risk of re-contamination is minimized if the water is stored in the bottles. Refilling and storage in other containers increases the risk of contamination.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Suggested treatment schedule<ref name=\"AutoSB-2\" />\n|-\n! Weather conditions\n!

Applying SODIS without proper assessment (or with false assessment) of existing hygienic practices & diarrhea incidence may not address other routes of infection. Community trainers must themselves be trained first.<ref name=\"TrainingEN\" />\n\n== Applications ==\nSODIS is an effective method for treating water where fuel or cookers are unavailable or prohibitively expensive. Even where fuel is available, SODIS is a more economical and environmentally friendly option. The application of SODIS is limited if enough bottles are not available, or if the water is highly [[turbid]].  In fact, if the water is highly turbid, SODIS cannot be used alone;  additional filtering is then necessary.<ref name=\"AutoSB-3\" />\n\nA basic field test to determine if the water is too turbid for the SODIS method to work properly is the newspaper test.<ref name=\"Training\" /> For the newspaper test the user has to place the filled bottle upright on top of a newspaper headline and look down through the bottle opening. If the letters of the headline are readable, the water can be used for the SODIS method. If the letters are not readable then the turbidity of the water likely exceeds 30 NTU, and the water must be pretreated.\n\nIn theory, the method could be used in disaster relief or refugee camps. However, supplying bottles may be more difficult than providing equivalent disinfecting tablets containing chlorine, bromine, or iodine. In addition, in some circumstances, it may be difficult to guarantee that the water will be left in the sun for the necessary time.\n\nOther methods for household water treatment and safe storage exist (e.g., chlorination) different filtration procedures or flocculation/disinfection. The selection of the adequate method should be based on the criteria of effectiveness, the co-occurrence of other types of pollution (turbidity, chemical pollutants), treatment costs, labor input and convenience, and the user\u2019s preference.\n\nWhen the water is highly turbid, SODIS cannot be used alone;  additional filtering or flocculation is then necessary to clarify the water prior to SODIS treatment.<ref name=\"AutoSB-21\" /><ref name=\"Scaling\" /> Recent work has shown that common table salt (NaCl) is an effective flocculation agent for decreasing turbidity for the SODIS method in some types of soil.<ref name=\"AutoSB-22\" /> This method could be used to increase the geographic areas for which the SODIS method could be used as regions with highly turbid water could be treated for low costs.<ref>B.

SODIS bags have been found to yield as much as 74% higher treatment efficiencies than SODIS bottles, which may be because the bags are able to reach elevated temperatures that cause accelerated treatment.<ref name=\"Pierik\" /> SODIS bags with a water layer of approximately 1&nbsp;cm to 6&nbsp;cm reach higher temperatures more easily than SODIS bottles, and treat Vibrio cholerae more effectively.<ref name=\"Pierik\" />  It is assumed this is because of the improved surface area to volume ratio in SODIS bags. In remote regions plastic bottles are not locally available and need to be shipped in from urban centers which may be expensive and inefficient since bottles cannot be packed very tightly. Bags can be packed more densely than bottles, and can be shipped at lower cost, representing an economically preferable alternative to SODIS bottles in remote communities. The disadvantages of using bags are that they can give the water a plastic smell, they are more difficult to handle when filled with water, and they typically require that the water be transferred to a second container for drinking.\n\nAnother important benefit in using the SODIS bottles as opposed to the bags or other methods requiring the water to be transferred to a smaller container for consumption is that the bottles are a point-of-use household water treatment method.<ref name=\"Mintz\" /> Point-of-use means that the water is treated in the same easy to handle container it will be served from, thus decreasing the risk of secondary water contamination.\n\n== Cautions ==\n[[File:U+2673 DejaVu Sans.svg|thumb|The PET recycling mark shows that a bottle is made from polyethylene terephthalate, making it suitable for solar water disinfection<ref name=\"AutoSB-4\" />]]\n\nIf the water bottles are not left in the sun for the proper length of time, the water may not be safe to drink and could cause illness. If the sunlight is less strong, due to overcast weather or a less sunny climate, a longer exposure time in the sun is necessary.\n\nThe following issues should also be considered:\n\n; Bottle material: Some glass or PVC materials may prevent ultraviolet light from reaching the water.<ref name=\"AutoSB-5\" /> Commercially available bottles made of [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] are recommended. The handling is much more convenient in the case of PET bottles. [[Polycarbonate]] (resin identification code 7) blocks all UVA and UVB rays, and therefore should not be used. Bottles that are clear are to be preferred over bottles that have been colored, for example green lemon/lime soda pop bottles.\n; Aging of plastic bottles: SODIS efficiency depends on the physical condition of the plastic bottles, with scratches and other signs of wear reducing the efficiency of SODIS. Heavily scratched or old, blind bottles should be replaced.\n; Shape of containers: The intensity of the UV radiation decreases rapidly with increasing water depth. At a water depth of 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;inches) and moderate turbidity of 26 NTU, UV-A radiation is reduced to 50%. PET soft drink bottles are often easily available and thus most practical for the SODIS application.\n; Oxygen: Sunlight produces highly reactive forms of oxygen (oxygen free radicals and hydrogen peroxides) in the water. These reactive molecules contribute in the destruction process of the microorganisms. Under normal conditions (rivers, creeks, wells, ponds, tap) water contains sufficient oxygen (more than 3&nbsp;mg/L of oxygen) and does not have to be aerated before the application of SODIS.\n; Leaching of bottle material: There has been some concern over the question of whether plastic drinking containers can release chemicals or toxic components into water, a process possibly accelerated by heat. The [[Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research]] have examined the diffusion of [[adipate]]s and [[phthalates]] (DEHA and [[DEHP]]) from new and reused PET-bottles in the water during solar exposure. The levels of concentrations found in the water after a solar exposure of 17 hours in {{convert|60|C|abbr=on|adj=on}} water were far below [[World Health Organization|WHO]] guidelines for drinking water and in the same magnitude as the concentrations of phthalate and adipate generally found in high-quality tap water. Concerns about the general use of PET-bottles were also expressed after a report published by researchers from the [[University of Heidelberg]] on the release of [[Polyethylene terephthalate#Antimony|antimony]] from PET-bottles for soft drinks and mineral water stored over several months in supermarkets. However, the antimony concentrations found in the bottles are orders of magnitude below WHO<ref name=\"AutoSB-6\" />  and national guidelines for antimony concentrations in drinking water.<ref name=\"AutoSB-7\" /><ref name=\"AutoSB-8\" /><ref name=\"AutoSB-9\" />  Furthermore, SODIS water is not stored over such extended periods in the bottles.\n; Regrowth of bacteria: Once removed from sunlight, remaining bacteria may again reproduce in the dark. A 2010 study showed that adding just 10 parts per million of hydrogen peroxide is effective in preventing the regrowth of wild [[Salmonella]].<ref name=\"AutoSB-10\" />\n; Toxic chemicals: Solar water disinfection does not remove [[toxic]] chemicals that may be present in the water, such as factory waste.\n\n== Health impact, diarrhea reduction ==\n[[File:Mwamongu water source.jpg|thumb|Only forty-six percent of people in Africa have safe drinking water]]\n\nAccording to the [[World Health Organization]], more than two million people per year die of preventable water-borne diseases, and one billion people lack access to a source of improved drinking water.<ref name=\"AutoSB-19\" /><ref name=\"AutoSB-20\" />\n\nIt has been shown that the SODIS method (and other methods of household water treatment) can very effectively remove pathogenic contamination from the water. However, infectious diseases are also transmitted through other pathways, i.e. due to a general lack of sanitation and hygiene. Studies on the reduction of diarrhea among SODIS users show reduction values of 30\u201380%.<ref name=\"AutoSB-11\" /><ref name=\"AutoSB-12\" /><ref name=\"AutoSB-13\" /><ref name=\"AutoSB-14\" />\n\n==Research==\nThe effectiveness of the SODIS was first discovered by Aftim Acra, of the [[American University of Beirut]] in the early 1980s. Follow-up was conducted by the research groups of [[Martin Wegelin]] at the [[Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology]] (EAWAG) and [[Kevin McGuigan]] at the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]]. Clinical control trials were pioneered by Ronan Conroy of the RCSI team in collaboration with [[Michael Elmore-Meegan]].[[ICROSS]]\n\nA joint research project on SODIS was implemented by the following institutions:\n* [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]] (RCSI), Ireland (coordination)\n* [[University of Ulster]] (UU), [[United Kingdom]]\n* CSIR Environmentek, South Africa, EAWAG, Switzerland\n* The [[Institute of Water and Sanitation Development]] ([[IWSD]]), Zimbabwe\n* [[Plataforma Solar de Almer\u00eda]] (CIEMAT-PSA), Spain\n* [[University of Leicester]] (UL), United Kingdom\n* The [[International Commission for the Relief of Suffering and Starvation]] ([[ICROSS]]), Kenya\n* [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] (USC), Spain\n* [[Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology]] (Eawag), Switzerland\n\nThe project embarked on a multi-country study including study areas in [[Zimbabwe]], [[South Africa]] and [[Kenya]].\n\nOther developments include the development of a continuous flow disinfection unit<ref name=\"pmid14766599\" /> and solar disinfection with titanium dioxide film over glass cylinders, which prevents the bacterial regrowth of [[Coliform bacteria|coliforms]] after SODIS.<ref name=\"pmid16949121\" />\n\nResearch has shown that a number of low-cost additives are capable of accelerating SODIS and that additives might make SODIS more rapid and effective in both sunny and cloudy weather, developments that could help make the technology more effective and acceptable to users.<ref name=\"pmid17998606\" />  A 2008 study showed that powdered seeds of five natural legumes (peas, beans and lentils)\u2014''[[cowpea|Vigna unguiculata]]'' (cowpea), ''[[urad (bean)|Phaseolus mungo]]'' (black lentil), ''[[soybean|Glycine max]]'' (soybean), ''[[pea|Pisum sativum]]'' (green pea), and ''[[Arachis hypogaea]]'' (peanut)\u2014when evaluated as natural flocculants for the removal of turbidity, were as effective as commercial alum and even superior for clarification in that the optimum dosage was low (1&nbsp;g/L), flocculation was rapid (7\u201325 minutes, depending on the seed used) and the water hardness and pH was essentially unaltered.<ref name=\"pmid18348392\" /> Later studies have used [[chestnuts]], [[oak]] acorns, and ''[[Moringa oleifera]]'' (drumstick tree) for the same purpose.<ref name=\"AutoSB-15\" /><ref name=\"AutoSB-16\" />\n\nOther research has examined the use of doped semiconductors to increase the production of oxygen radicals under solar UV-A.<ref name=\"AutoSB-17\" /> Recently, researchers at the [[National Centre for Sensor Research]] and the [[Biomedical Diagnostics Institute]] at [[Dublin City University]] have developed an inexpensive printable UV dosimeter for SODIS applications that can be read using a mobile phone.<ref name=\"AutoSB-18\" /> The camera of the phone is used to acquire an image of the sensor and custom software running on the phone analyses the sensor colour to provide a quantitative measurement of UV dose.\n\nIn isolated regions the effect of wood smoke increases lung disease, due to the constant need for building fires to boil water and cook. Research groups have found that boiling of water is neglected due to the difficulty of gathering wood, which is scarce in many areas. When presented with basic household water treatment options residents in isolated regions in Africa have shown a preference for the SODIS method over boiling or other basic water treatment methods.\n\nA very simple solar water purifier for rural households has been developed which uses 4 layers of saree cloth and solar tubular collectors to remove all coliforms.<ref>[https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/115/01/0032.pdf   Low-cost solar water purifier for rural households.

Villagers there using the SODIS method have been quite successful, since the temperature during the day can go beyond {{convert|40|C|abbr=on}} and there is a limited amount of shade.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nOne of the most important things to consider for public health workers reaching out to communities in need of suitable, cost efficient, and sustainable water treatment methods is teaching the importance of water quality in the context of health promotion and disease prevention while educating about the methods themselves. Although skepticism has posed a challenge in some communities to adopt SODIS and other household water treatment methods for daily use, disseminating knowledge on the important health benefits associated with these methods will likely increase adoption rates.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Appropriate technology]]\n* [[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]]\n* [[Water Pasteurization Indicator]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"AutoSB-1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/household_water/research/technologies_intro/en/ |work=Household water treatment and safe storage |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |title=WHO &#124; Treatment technologies|accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Training\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sodis.ch/methode/anwendung/ausbildungsmaterial/index_EN |title=Training material |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Environmental Science and Technology (EAWAG) Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries (SANDEC) |accessdate=1 February 2010 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"TrainingEN\">{{cite book |title=Solar water disinfection&nbsp;\u2014 A guide for the application of SODIS |vauthors=Meierhofer R, Wegelin M |date=October 2002 |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Environmental Science and Technology (EAWAG) Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries (SANDEC) |isbn=978-3-906484-24-2 |url=http://www.sodis.ch/methode/anwendung/ausbildungsmaterial/dokumente_material/manual_e.pdf}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoSB-2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sodis.ch/Text2002/T-Howdoesitwork.htm |title=How does it work?

{"title_page": "Tidewater glacier cycle", "text_new": "[[File:Taku Icefield.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The [[Taku Glacier]].]]\nThe '''tidewater glacier cycle''' is the typically centuries-long behavior of [[glacier|tidewater glaciers]] that consists of recurring periods of advance alternating with rapid retreat and punctuated by periods of stability. During portions of its cycle, a tidewater glacier is relatively insensitive to [[climate change (general concept)|climate change]].\n\n==Calving rate of tidewater glaciers==\n[[File:Icebergs cape york 4.jpg|right|thumb|270px|Iceberg [[Ice calving|calving]] from several tidewater glaciers, [[Cape York (Greenland)|Cape York]], [[Greenland]]]]\nWhile climate is the main factor affecting the behavior of all glaciers, additional factors affect calving ([[iceberg]]-producing) tidewater glaciers. These glaciers terminate abruptly at the ocean interface,  with large pieces of the glacier fracturing and separating, or [[Ice calving|calving]], from the ice front as icebergs.\n\nClimate change causes a shift in the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of a glacier. This is the imaginary line on a glacier, above which snow accumulates faster than it ablates, and below which, the reverse is the case. This altitude shift, in turn, prompts a retreat or advance of the terminus toward a new steady-state position. However, this change in terminus behavior for calving glaciers is also a function of resulting changes in [[fjord]] geometry, and calving rate at the glacier terminus as it changes position.<ref name=\"Mercer\">{{Cite journal| last = Mercer| first = J.H.| author-link = | title = The response of fjord glaciers to changes in the firn limit| journal = Journal of Glaciology| volume = 3/29| pages = 850\u2013858| year = 1961}}</ref><ref name=\"Post1\">{{Cite journal| first =Post| last =Austen| title =Preliminary hydrography and historical terminal changes of Columbia Glacier| year =1975| publisher =U.S. Geological Survey Hydrologic Investigations Atlas HA-559}}</ref>\n\nCalving glaciers are different from land terminating glaciers in the variation in velocity along their length.  Land terminating glacier velocities decline as the terminus is approached.  Calving glaciers accelerate at the terminus.   A declining velocity near the terminus slows the glacier response to climate.  An accelerating velocity at the front enhances the speed of the glaciers response to climate or glacier dynamic changes.

Using data collected from 13 Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers, Brown et al. (1982) derived the following relationship between calving speed and water depth: <math>V_C = CH_w + D</math>, where <math>V_C</math> is the mean calving speed ([[metre|m]]\u22c5[[Annum|a]]<sup>\u22121</sup>), <math>C</math> is a calving coefficient (27.1\u00b12&nbsp;a<sup>\u22121</sup>), <math>H_w</math> is the mean water depth at glacier front (m) and <math>D</math> is a constant (0&nbsp;m\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup>).  Pelto and Warren (1991) found a similar calving relationship with tidewater glaciers observed over longer time periods, with slightly reduced calving rate to the mainly summer rates noted by Brown et al. (1982).<ref name=\"Brown1982\"/><ref name=\"PeltoWarren1991\"/>\n\nCalving is an important form of ablation for glaciers that terminate in [[Fresh water|freshwater]], also.  Funk and R\u00f6thlisberger determined a relationship between calving speed and water depth based on analysis of six glaciers that calve into lakes.<ref name=\"Funk1989\">{{cite journal | last =Funk | first =M. |author2=R\u00f6thlisberger, F. | title =Forecasting the effects of a planned reservoir which will partially flood the tongue of Unteraargletscher in Switzerland | journal =Annals of Glaciology | volume =13 | pages =76\u201381 | publisher =[[International Glaciological Society]] | year =1989 }}</ref>  They found that the same basic calving relationship developed for tidewater calving glaciers was true for freshwater calving glaciers, only the calving coefficients lead to calving rates 10% of that for tidewater glaciers.\n\n==Tidewater glacier phases==\nObservations of Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers prompted Austin Post<ref name=\"Post1\"/> to describe the tidewater calving glacier advance/retreat cycle:  (1) advancing, (2) stable-extended, (3) drastically retreating, or (4) stable-retracted.  The following is a detailed review of the tidewater glacier cycle derived by Post, with numerous cited examples, the cycle is based on observations of temperate tidewater glaciers in Alaska, not outlet glaciers from large ice sheets or polar glaciers.\n\nThe ''accumulation area ratio'' of a glacier, AAR, is the percentage of a glacier that is a snow-covered accumulation zone at the end of the summer melt season.  This percentage for large Alaskan glaciers is between 60 and 70 for non-calving glaciers, 70-80 for moderately calving glaciers and up to 90 for very high calving rate glaciers.<ref name=\"Pelto2\">{{cite journal| last =Pelto| first =M.S.| title =Mass balance of southeast Alaska and northwest British Columbia glaciers from 1976 to 1984: Methods and Results| journal =Annals of Glaciology| volume =9| issue =| pages =189\u2013193| year =1987| url=http://crevassezone.org/reports/JIRP/37-Balance76-84.pdf }}</ref> By using accumulation area ratio (AAR) data for Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers, Pelto (1987)<ref name=\"Pelto2\"/> and Viens (1995)<ref name=\"Viens1\">{{Cite journal| first =R.J.| last =Viens| title =Dynamics and mass balance of tidewater calving glaciers of southern Alaska (Unpublished Masters thesis)| year =1995| pages =| place =University of Washington}}</ref> produced models showing that climate acts as a first-order control on the advance/retreat cycle of calving glaciers during most of the advance retreat cycle, but there are climate insensitive periods as well.  Pelto (1987) examined the terminus behavior of 90 Alaskan glaciers and found that the terminus behavior of all 90 were correctly predicted based on the AAR and calving rate.<ref name=\"Pelto2\"/>\n\n===Advancing===\n[[File:Hub Glacier.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The Hubbard Glacier]]\nIf we begin at the stable retracted position at the end of a tidewater glacier cycle the glacier will have a moderate calving rate and a high AAR, above 70.  The glacier will build a terminus [[shoal]] of [[sediment]] further reducing the calving rate.  This will improve the [[glacier mass balance]] and the glacier can begin to advance due to this change or an increase in ice flux to the terminus due to increasing snowfall or reduced snow melt.  As the advance proceeds the terminus shoal will be pushed in front of the glacier and continue to build, keeping the calving rate low.  In the case of the most glaciers such as the [[Taku Glacier]] the glacier will eventually build a terminus shoal that is above water and calving will essentially cease. This will eliminate this loss of ice from the glacier and the glacier can continue to advance. Taku Glacier and [[Hubbard Glacier]] have been in this phase of the cycle. Taku Glacier which has been advancing for 120 years no longer calves. Hubbard Glacier still has a calving front.<ref name=\"Pelto3\">{{cite web| last =Pelto| first =Mauri S. |author2=Matt Beedle |author3=Maynard M.

Brady Glacier has been thinning during the last two decades due to the higher equilibrium line altitudes accompanying warmer conditions in the region, and its secondary termini have begun to retreat.  A glacier can remain at this position for sometime, a century at least in the case of Brady Glacier.  Usually substantial thinning occurs before retreat from the shoal commences.  This allowed the prediction in 1980, by the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS), of the retreat of the [[Columbia Glacier (Alaska)|Columbia Glacier]] from its terminus shoal.<ref name=\"Meier\">{{Cite journal|last=Meier|first=M.F|author2=A.

The water depth initially increases as the glacier retreats from the shoal, causing every more rapid glacier flow, calving and retreat.  A glacier is comparatively insensitive to climate during this calving retreat.  However, in the case of [[San Rafael Glacier]], [[Chile]], a switch from retreat  (1945\u20131990) to advance (1990\u20131997) was noted.<ref name=\"Warren\">{{cite journal| last =Warren| first =C.

They noted that the average calving rate from Columbia Glacier increased from 3&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup> in the second half of 1983 to 4&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup> during the first nine months of 1984. This rate was four times greater than that measured at the end of 1977 and increased again in 1985. The glacier flow, i.e., the movement of the ice toward the sea, also increased, it was inadequate to keep pace with the break-up and expulsion of icebergs.  The increase in speed instead seemed to just feed the ever faster conveyor to the terminus for iceberg production. This prompted the USGS to predict that the glacier would retreat 32&nbsp;km before stabilizing.<ref name=\"Meier\"/>  By 2006, it has retreated 16&nbsp;km. The water remains deep and the calving rate and glacier velocity very high, indicating retreat will continue. At this point, just like having a balloon payment in an adjustable rate mortgage, the glacier has to pay a whole new portion of its balance via icebergs.  The glacier accelerates as flow is enhanced by the calving process; this increases the export of icebergs from the glacier.  Large calving retreats are initiated by warming conditions causing ice thinning.  The resulting retreat to a new equilibrium conditions can be far more extensive than will be regained during the next advance stage. A good example of this is Muir Glacier.\n\nNext to Glacier Bay, Icy Bay has had the most extensive retreat. At the beginning of the 20th century, the coastline was nearly straight and the bay non-existent.  The entrance of the bay was filled by a tidewater glacier face that calved icebergs directly into the Gulf of Alaska.  A century later glacier retreat has opened a multi-armed bay more than 30 miles long.  The tidewater glacier has divided into three independent glaciers, Yahtse, Tsaa and Guyot Glacier. Other examples of glaciers currently in the retreat phase are South Sawyer and Sawyer Glaciers in Alaska, retreating 2.1 and 2.3&nbsp;km respectively from 1961 to 2005.\n\nIn Patagonia an example of a rapidly retreating glacier is the Jorge Montt Glacier which drains into Baja Jorge Montt in the Pacific Ocean. The glacier's ice thinning, at low elevations, from 1975 to 2000 reached 18&nbsp;m\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup> at the lowest elevations.

These glaciers terminate abruptly at the ocean interface,  with large pieces of the glacier fracturing and separating, or [[Ice calving|calving]], from the ice front as icebergs.\n\nClimate change causes a shift in the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of a glacier. This is the imaginary line on a glacier, above which snow accumulates faster than it ablates, and below which, the reverse is the case. This altitude shift, in turn, prompts a retreat or advance of the terminus toward a new steady-state position. However, this change in terminus behavior for calving glaciers is also a function of resulting changes in [[fjord]] geometry, and calving rate at the glacier terminus as it changes position.<ref name=\"Mercer\">{{Cite journal| last = Mercer| first = J.H.| author-link = | title = The response of fjord glaciers to changes in the firn limit| journal = Journal of Glaciology| volume = 3/29| pages = 850\u2013858| year = 1961}}</ref><ref name=\"Post1\">{{Cite journal| first =Post| last =Austen| title =Preliminary hydrography and historical terminal changes of Columbia Glacier| year =1975| publisher =U.S. Geological Survey Hydrologic Investigations Atlas HA-559}}</ref>\n\nCalving glaciers are different from land terminating glaciers in the variation in velocity along their length.  Land terminating glacier velocities decline as the terminus is approached.  Calving glaciers accelerate at the terminus.

Using data collected from 13 Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers, Brown et al. (1982) derived the following relationship between calving speed and water depth: <math>V_C = CH_w + D</math>, where <math>V_C</math> is the mean calving speed ([[metre|m]]\u22c5[[Annum|a]]<sup>\u22121</sup>), <math>C</math> is a calving coefficient (27.1\u00b12&nbsp;a<sup>\u22121</sup>), <math>H_w</math> is the mean water depth at glacier front (m) and <math>D</math> is a constant (0&nbsp;m\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup>).  Pelto and Warren (1991) found a similar calving relationship with tidewater glaciers observed over longer time periods, with slightly reduced calving rate to the mainly summer rates noted by Brown et al. (1982).<ref name=\"Brown1982\"/><ref name=\"PeltoWarren1991\"/>\n\nCalving is an important form of ablation for glaciers that terminate in [[Fresh water|freshwater]], also.

The following is a detailed review of the tidewater glacier cycle derived by Post, with numerous cited examples, the cycle is based on observations of temperate tidewater glaciers in Alaska, not outlet glaciers from large ice sheets or polar glaciers.\n\nThe ''accumulation area ratio'' of a glacier, AAR, is the percentage of a glacier that is a snow-covered accumulation zone at the end of the summer melt season.  This percentage for large Alaskan glaciers is between 60 and 70 for non-calving glaciers, 70-80 for moderately calving glaciers and up to 90 for very high calving rate glaciers.<ref name=\"Pelto2\">{{cite journal| last =Pelto| first =M.S.| title =Mass balance of southeast Alaska and northwest British Columbia glaciers from 1976 to 1984: Methods and Results| journal =Annals of Glaciology| volume =9| issue =| pages =189\u2013193| year =1987| url=http://crevassezone.org/reports/JIRP/37-Balance76-84.pdf }}</ref> By using accumulation area ratio (AAR) data for Alaskan tidewater calving glaciers, Pelto (1987)<ref name=\"Pelto2\"/> and Viens (1995)<ref name=\"Viens1\">{{Cite journal| first =R.J.| last =Viens| title =Dynamics and mass balance of tidewater calving glaciers of southern Alaska (Unpublished Masters thesis)| year =1995| pages =| place =University of Washington}}</ref> produced models showing that climate acts as a first-order control on the advance/retreat cycle of calving glaciers during most of the advance retreat cycle, but there are climate insensitive periods as well.

The glacier will build a terminus [[shoal]] of [[sediment]] further reducing the calving rate.  This will improve the [[glacier mass balance]] and the glacier can begin to advance due to this change or an increase in ice flux to the terminus due to increasing snowfall or reduced snow melt.  As the advance proceeds the terminus shoal will be pushed in front of the glacier and continue to build, keeping the calving rate low.  In the case of the most glaciers such as the [[Taku Glacier]] the glacier will eventually build a terminus shoal that is above water and calving will essentially cease. This will eliminate this loss of ice from the glacier and the glacier can continue to advance. Taku Glacier and [[Hubbard Glacier]] have been in this phase of the cycle. Taku Glacier which has been advancing for 120 years no longer calves.

Brady Glacier has been thinning during the last two decades due to the higher equilibrium line altitudes accompanying warmer conditions in the region, and its secondary termini have begun to retreat.  A glacier can remain at this position for sometime, a century at least in the case of Brady Glacier.  Usually substantial thinning occurs before retreat from the shoal commences.

The water depth initially increases as the glacier retreats from the shoal, causing every more rapid glacier flow, calving and retreat.  A glacier is comparatively insensitive to climate during this calving retreat.

They noted that the average calving rate from Columbia Glacier increased from 3&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup> in the second half of 1983 to 4&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup> during the first nine months of 1984. This rate was four times greater than that measured at the end of 1977 and increased again in 1985. The glacier flow, i.e., the movement of the ice toward the sea, also increased, it was inadequate to keep pace with the break-up and expulsion of icebergs.  The increase in speed instead seemed to just feed the ever faster conveyor to the terminus for iceberg production. This prompted the USGS to predict that the glacier would retreat 32&nbsp;km before stabilizing.<ref name=\"Meier\"/>  By 2006, it has retreated 16&nbsp;km. The water remains deep and the calving rate and glacier velocity very high, indicating retreat will continue. At this point, just like having a balloon payment in an adjustable rate mortgage, the glacier has to pay a whole new portion of its balance via icebergs.  The glacier accelerates as flow is enhanced by the calving process; this increases the export of icebergs from the glacier.  Large calving retreats are initiated by warming conditions causing ice thinning.  The resulting retreat to a new equilibrium conditions can be far more extensive than will be regained during the next advance stage. A good example of this is Muir Glacier.\n\nNext to Glacier Bay, Icy Bay has had the most extensive retreat. At the beginning of the 20th century, the coastline was nearly straight and the bay non-existent.  The entrance of the bay was filled by a tidewater glacier face that calved icebergs directly into the Gulf of Alaska.  A century later glacier retreat has opened a multi-armed bay more than 30 miles long.  The tidewater glacier has divided into three independent glaciers, Yahtse, Tsaa and Guyot Glacier. Other examples of glaciers currently in the retreat phase are South Sawyer and Sawyer Glaciers in Alaska, retreating 2.1 and 2.3&nbsp;km respectively from 1961 to 2005.\n\nIn Patagonia an example of a rapidly retreating glacier is the Jorge Montt Glacier which drains into Baja Jorge Montt in the Pacific Ocean. The glacier\u2019s ice thinning, at low elevations, from 1975 to 2000 reached 18&nbsp;m\u22c5a<sup>\u22121</sup> at the lowest elevations. The glacier calving front experienced a major retreat of 8.5&nbsp;km in those 25 years as a result of rapid thinning [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=16337].\n\n===Stable-retracted===\nAt some point the glacier reaches a pinning point where calving is reduced due to a fjord narrowing or shoaling and the glacier\u2019s AAR is near 100.
