At the age of three, Suharto was returned to his mother, who had married a local farmer whom Suharto helped in the rice paddies.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 10\" /> In 1929, Suharto's father took him to live with his sister, who was married to an agricultural supervisor, Prawirowihardjo, in the town of Wuryantoro in a poor and low-yielding farming area near [[Wonogiri]]. Over the following two years, he was taken back to his mother in Kemusuk by his stepfather and then back again to Wuryantoro by his father.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 11\">McDonald (1980), p. 11.</ref>\n\nPrawirowihardjo took to raising the boy as his own, which provided Suharto with a father-figure and a stable home in Wuryantoro. In 1931, he moved to the town of Wonogiri to attend the primary school, living first with Prawirohardjo's son Sulardi, and later with his father's relative Hardjowijono. While living with Hardjowijono, Suharto became acquainted with Darjatmo, a ''dukun'' (\"shaman\") of Javanese mystical arts and faith healing. The experience deeply affected him and later, as president, Suharto surrounded himself with powerful symbolic language.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /> Difficulties in paying the fees for his education in Wonogiri resulted in another move back to his father in Kemusuk, where he continued studying at a lower-fee [[Muhammadiyah]] middle school in the city of [[Yogyakarta]] until 1939.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 11\" /><ref name=\"ELSON1\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 1\u20136 }}</ref>\n\nLike many Javanese, Suharto had [[Javanese name|only one name]].<ref name=globe>Haskin, Colin, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/article663945.ece \"Suharto dead at 86\"]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, ''The Globe and Mail'', 27 January 2008</ref> In religious contexts in recent years he has sometimes been called \"[[Hajji|Haji]]\" or \"el-Haj Mohammed Suharto\", but these names were not part of his formal name or generally used. The spelling \"Suharto\" reflects modern Indonesian spelling, although the general approach in Indonesia is to rely on the spelling preferred by the person concerned. At the time of his birth, the standard transcription was \"Soeharto\", but he preferred the original spelling. The international English-language press generally uses the spelling 'Suharto' while the Indonesian government and media use 'Soeharto'.<ref>{{cite book | title=Politics and the press in Indonesia | last=Romano | first=Angela Rose | page=ix | year=2003 | isbn=0-7007-1745-5}}</ref>\n\nSuharto's upbringing contrasts with that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as [[Sukarno]] in that he is believed to have had little interest in [[anti-colonialism]], or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little or no contact with European colonisers. Consequently, he did not learn to speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or other European languages in his youth. He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.<ref name=\"ELSON1\"/>\n\n==Military career==\n{{Main|Early life and career of Suharto}}\n\n===World War II and Japanese occupation===\n{{See also|Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies}}\n\nSuharto finished middle school at the age of 18 and took a clerical job at a bank in Wuryantaro. He was forced to resign after a bicycle mishap tore his only working clothes.<ref>McDonald (1980), pages 12\u201313</ref> Following a spell of unemployment, he joined the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) in June 1940 and undertook basic training in [[Gombong]] near Yogyakarta. With the Netherlands under German occupation and the Japanese pressing for access to Indonesian oil supplies, the Dutch had opened up the KNIL to large intakes of previously excluded Javanese.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, pages 13\">McDonald (1980), pages 13</ref> Suharto was assigned to Battalion XIII at Rampal, graduated from a short training course at KNIL ''Kaderschool'' in [[Gombong]] to become a sergeant, and was posted to a KNIL reserve battalion in [[Cisarua]].<ref name=\"ELSON2\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| page=8 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Dutch surrender to the [[Dutch East Indies Campaign|invading Japanese forces]] in March 1942, Suharto abandoned his KNIL uniform and went back to Wurjantoro. After months of unemployment, he then became one of the thousands of Indonesians who took the opportunity to join Japanese-organised security forces by joining the Yogyakarta police force.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, pages 13\" /> In October 1943, Suharto was transferred from the police force to the newly formed Japanese-sponsored militia, the [[Pembela Tanah Air|PETA]] (Defenders of the Fatherland) in which Indonesians served as officers. In his training to serve with the rank of ''shodancho'' (platoon commander) he encountered a localised version of the Japanese ''[[bushido]]'', or \"way of the warrior\", used to indoctrinate troops. This training encouraged an anti-Dutch and pro-nationalist thought, although toward the aims of the Imperial Japanese militarists. The encounter with a nationalistic and militarist ideology is believed to have profoundly influenced Suharto's own way of thinking.<ref name=\"ELSON3\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| page = 9 }}</ref>\n\nSuharto was posted to a PETA coastal defence battalion at [[Wates, Kulon Progo|Wates]], south of Yogyakarta until he was admitted for training for company commander (''chudancho'') in [[Bogor]] from April to August 1944. As company commander, he conducted training for new PETA recruits in [[Surakarta]], [[Jakarta]], and [[Madiun]]. The Japanese surrender and [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence]] in August 1945 occurred while Suharto was posted to the remote Brebeg area (on the slopes of [[Mount Wilis]]) to train new NCOs to replace those executed by the Japanese in the aftermath of the failed February [[1945 PETA Revolt in Blitar]], led by [[Supriyadi]].\n\n===Indonesian National Revolution===\n{{See also|Indonesian National Revolution}}\n\nTwo days after the Japanese surrender in the Pacific, independence leaders [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]] [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|declared Indonesian independence]] and were appointed President and Vice-President respectively of the new Republic. Suharto disbanded his regiment under orders from the Japanese command and returned to Yogyakarta.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 14\">McDonald (1980), p. 14.</ref> As republican groups rose to assert Indonesian independence, Suharto joined a new unit of the newly formed Indonesian army. Based on his PETA experience, he was appointed deputy commander, and subsequently, a battalion commander when the republican forces were formally organised in October 1945.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 14\" /> Suharto was involved in fighting against Allied troops around [[Magelang]] and [[Semarang]] and was subsequently appointed the head of a brigade as lieutenant-colonel, having earned respect as a field commander.<ref>McDonald (1980), p. 16.</ref> In the early years of the War, he organised local armed forces into Battalion X of Regiment I; Suharto was promoted to Major and became Battalion X's leader.<ref name=\"ELSON4\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 14\u201315 }}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the Allies, under a mandate to return the situation to the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'', quickly led to clashes between Indonesian republicans and Allied forces, i.e. returning Dutch and assisting British forces. Suharto led his Division X troops to halt an advance by the Dutch T (\"Tiger\") Brigade on 17 May 1946. It earned him the respect of Lieutenant-Colonel Sunarto Kusumodirjo, who invited him to draft the working guidelines for the Battle Leadership Headquarters (MPP), a body created to organise and unify the command structure of the Indonesian Nationalist forces.<ref name=\"ELSON5\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 15\u201317 }}</ref> The military forces of the still infant Republic of Indonesia were constantly restructuring. By August 1946, Suharto was head of the 22nd Regiment of Division III (the \"[[Kodam IV/Diponegoro|Diponegoro Division]]\") stationed in Yogyakarta. In late 1946, the Diponegoro Division assumed responsibility for the defence of the west and southwest of [[Yogyakarta]] from Dutch forces. Conditions at the time are reported by Dutch sources as miserable; Suharto himself is reported as assisting smuggling syndicates in the transport of [[opium]] through the territory he controlled, to generate income. In September 1948, Suharto was dispatched to meet [[Musso]], chairman of the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI) in an unsuccessful attempt at a peaceful reconciliation of the [[Madiun Affair|communist uprising in Madiun]].<ref name=\"ELSON6\" />\n\n[[File:Lieutenant Colonel Suharto.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lieutenant Colonel Suharto in 1947]]\n\nIn December 1948, the Dutch launched \"[[Operatie Kraai|Operation Crow]]\", which resulted in the capture of Sukarno and Hatta and the capital [[Yogyakarta]]. Suharto was appointed to lead the ''Wehrkreise III'', consisting of two battalions, which waged guerrilla warfare against the Dutch from the hills south of [[Yogyakarta]].<ref name=\"ELSON6\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 20\u201325, 28\u201329 }}</ref> In dawn raids on 1 March 1949, Suharto's forces and local militia recaptured the city, holding it until noon.<ref>Soeharto, G.

However, General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Abdul Nasution]] said that Suharto took great care in preparing the \"General Offensive\" ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''Serangan Umum''). Civilians sympathetic to the Republican cause within the city had been galvanised by the show of force which proved that the Dutch had failed to win the guerrilla war. Internationally, the United Nations Security Council pressured the Dutch to cease the military offensive and to recommence negotiations, which eventually led to the Dutch withdrawal from Yogyakarta area in June 1949 and to complete transfer of sovereignty in December 1949. Suharto was responsible for the takeover of Yogyakarta city from the withdrawing Dutch in June 1949.<ref>{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 29\u201338, 42\u201344 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the Revolution, Suharto married [[Siti Hartinah]] (known as Madam Tien), the daughter of a minor noble in the Mangkunegaran royal house of Solo. The arranged marriage was enduring and supportive, lasting until Tien's death in 1996.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /> The couple had six children: [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana]] (Tutut, born 1949), Sigit Harjojudanto (born 1951), Bambang Trihatmodjo (born 1953), Siti Hediati (\"[[Titiek Suharto]]\", born 1959), [[Hutomo Mandala Putra]] (Tommy, born 1962), and Siti Hutami Endang Adiningish (Mamiek, born 1964). Within the Javanese upper class, it was considered acceptable for the wife to pursue genteel commerce{{clarify|date=April 2014}} to supplement the family budget, allowing her husband to keep his dignity in his official role. The commercial dealings{{clarify|date=April 2014}} of Tien, her children and grandchildren became extensive and ultimately undermined Suharto's presidency.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n\n===Post-Independence military career===\n[[File:Suharto family.jpg|thumb|Suharto with his wife and six children in 1967]]\nIn the years following Indonesian independence, Suharto served in the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|Indonesian National Army]], primarily in [[Java]].

This formed the military side of the campaign to win [[western New Guinea]] from the Dutch, who were preparing it for its own independence, separate from Indonesia.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /> In 1965, Suharto was assigned operational command of Sukarno's ''[[Konfrontasi]]'', against the newly formed Malaysia. Fearful that ''Konfrontasi'' would leave Java thinly covered by the army, and hand control to the 2 million-strong [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI), he authorised a Kostrad intelligence officer, [[Ali Murtopo]], to open secret contacts with the British and Malaysians.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n\n==Overthrow of Sukarno (1965)==\n{{Main|Transition to the New Order}}\n\n===Background===\n{{See also|Guided Democracy in Indonesia}}\n[[File:Sukarno, Sang Saka Melanglang Djagad, p12.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Sukarno]]]]\n\nTensions between the military and communists increased in April 1965, when Sukarno endorsed the immediate implementation of the PKI's proposal for a \"fifth armed force\" consisting of armed peasants and workers. However, this idea was rejected by the army's leadership as being tantamount to the PKI establishing its own armed forces. In May, the \"[[Gilchrist Document]]\" aroused Sukarno's fear of a military plot to overthrow him, a fear which he repeatedly mentioned during the next few months. On his independence day speech in August, Sukarno declared his intention to commit Indonesia to an anti-imperialist alliance with China and other communist regimes and warned the army not to interfere.<ref>Dake, Antonie (2006). Sukarno Files. Yayasan Obor</ref>\n\nWhile Sukarno devoted his energy for domestic and international politics, the economy of Indonesia deteriorated rapidly with worsening widespread poverty and hunger, while foreign debt obligations became unmanageable and infrastructure crumbled.  Sukarno's Guided Democracy stood on fragile grounds due to the inherent conflict between its two underlying support pillars, the military and the communists. The military, nationalists, and the Islamic groups were shocked by the rapid growth of the communist party under Sukarno's protection. They feared the imminent establishment of a communist state in Indonesia. By 1965, the PKI had three million members and was particularly strong in Central Java and Bali. The party had become the most potent political party in Indonesia.\n\n===Abortive coup and anti-communist purge===\n{{Main|30 September Movement|Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u20131966}}\n\n[[File:Suharto at funeral.jpg|thumb|As Major General, Suharto (''at right, foreground'') attends funeral for assassinated generals, 5 October 1965.]]\n\nBefore dawn on 1 October 1965, six army generals were kidnapped and executed in Jakarta by soldiers from the Presidential Guard, Diponegoro Division, and Brawidjaja Division.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 281</ref> Soldiers occupied Merdeka Square including the areas in front of the Presidential Palace, the national radio station, and telecommunications centre.

The 30 September Movement never made any attempt on Suharto's life.<ref>Vickers (2005), page 156</ref> Suharto had been in Jakarta army hospital that evening with his three-year-old son [[Tommy Suharto|Tommy]] who had a scalding injury. It was here that he was visited by Colonel Abdul Latief, a key member of [[30 September Movement]] and close family friend of Suharto. According to Latief's later testimony, the conspirators assumed Suharto to be a Sukarno-loyalist; hence Latief went to inform him of the impending kidnapping plan to save Sukarno from treacherous generals, upon which Suharto seemed to offer his neutrality.<ref name=\"Friend-2003_p104\">Friend (2003), page 104</ref>\n\nUpon being told of the killings, Suharto went to KOSTRAD headquarters just before dawn from where he could see soldiers occupying Merdeka Square. He mobilised [[KOSTRAD]] and RPKAD (now [[Kopassus]]) special forces to seize control of the centre of Jakarta, capturing key strategic sites including the radio station without resistance. Suharto announced over the radio at 9:00&nbsp;pm that six generals had been kidnapped by \"counter-revolutionaries\" and that the 30 September Movement actually intended to overthrow Sukarno. He said he was in control of the army, and that he would crush the 30 September Movement and safeguard Sukarno.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), p. 282.</ref> Suharto issued an ultimatum to [[Halim Perdanakusuma Airport|Halim Air Force Base]], where the G30S had based themselves and where Sukarno, air force commander [[Omar Dhani]] and PKI chairman [[Dipa Nusantara Aidit]] had gathered, causing them to disperse before Suhartoist soldiers occupied the airbase on 2 October after short fighting.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 281\u2013282</ref> With the failure of the poorly organised coup,<ref name=\"Ricklefs-1991_p281-282\">Ricklefs (1991), pages 281\u2013282</ref> and having secured authority from the president to restore order and security, Suharto's faction was firmly in control of the army by 2 October (he was officially appointed army commander on 14 October). On 5 October, Suharto led a dramatic public ceremony to bury the generals' bodies.\n\nComplicated and partisan theories continue to this day over the identity of the attempted coup's organisers and their aims. The army's version, and subsequently that of the [[Orde Baru|\"New Order\"]], was that the PKI was solely responsible.

On 11 March 1966, the appearance of unidentified troops around [[Merdeka Palace]] during a cabinet meeting (which Suharto had not attended) forced Sukarno to flee to [[Bogor Palace]] (60&nbsp;km away) by helicopter. Three pro-Suharto generals, Major-General [[Basuki Rahmat]], Brigadier-General [[M Jusuf]], and Brigadier-General [[Amirmachmud]] went to Bogor to meet Sukarno.

The army arrested 15 cabinet ministers and forced Sukarno to appoint [[Second Revised Dwikora Cabinet|a new cabinet]] consisting of Suharto supporters. The army arrested pro-Sukarno and pro-communist members of the [[Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat|MPRS]] (parliament), and Suharto replaced chiefs of the navy, air force, and the police force with his supporters, who then began an extensive purge within each service.<ref name=\"Elson 2001 pages = 130\u2013135\"/>\n\nIn June 1966, the now-purged parliament passed 24 resolutions including the banning of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], ratifying the [[Supersemar]], and stripping Sukarno of his title of President for Life. Against the wishes of Sukarno, the government ended the Konfrontasi with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations<ref name=\"Hughes 2002, pages 267-270\" >{{harvnb|Hughes|2002| pages = 267\u2013270 }}</ref> (Sukarno had removed Indonesia from the UN in the previous year).<ref name=\"Hughes 2002, page 107\" >{{harvnb|Hughes|2002| page = 107 }}</ref> Suharto did not seek Sukarno's outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining support for the president among some elements of the armed forces.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p.25</ref>\n\nBy January 1967, Suharto felt confident that he had removed all significant support for Sukarno within the armed forces, and the MPRS decided to hold another session to impeach Sukarno. On 22 February 1967, Sukarno announced he would resign from the presidency, and on 12 March, the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power and named Suharto [[Acting presidency of Suharto|acting president]].<ref>{{cite book | last =McDonald | first =Hamish | title =Suharto's Indonesia | publisher =Fontana Books | year =1980 | pages =60 | url = | isbn =0-00-635721-0}}</ref> Sukarno was placed under house arrest in [[Bogor Palace]]; little more was heard from him, and he died on June 1970.<ref name=\"Schwartz 1994, page 2\">Schwartz (1994), page 2</ref> On 27 March 1968, the MPRS appointed Suharto for the first of his five-year terms as president.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), p. 295.</ref>\n\n==The \"New Order\" (1967\u20131998)==\n{{See also|New Order (Indonesia)}}\n\n===Ideology===\nSuharto promoted his \"New Order\", as opposed to Sukarno's \"Old Order\", as a society based on the [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] ideology. After initially being careful not to offend sensitivities of Islamic scholars who feared Pancasila might develop into a quasi-religious cult, Suharto secured a parliamentary resolution in 1983 which obliged all organisations in Indonesia to adhere to Pancasila as a fundamental principle. He also instituted mandatory Pancasila training programs for all Indonesians, from primary school students to office workers. In practice, however, the vagueness of Pancasila was exploited by Suharto's government to justify their actions and to condemn their opponents as \"anti-Pancasila\".<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\">{{cite web |author=Ken Ward |url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Soeharto%E2%80%99s+New+Order+and+its+Legacy%3A+Essays+in+honour+of+Harold+Crouch/5331/ch02.xhtml#toc-anchor |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514025044/http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Soeharto%E2%80%99s+New+Order+and+its+Legacy%3A+Essays+in+honour+of+Harold+Crouch/5331/ch02.xhtml#toc-anchor |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-05-14 |title='2 Soeharto's Javanese Pancasila' in Soeharto's New Order and its Legacy: Essays in honour of Harold Crouch by Edited by Edward Aspinall and Greg Fealy &#124; ANU E Press |publisher=Epress.anu.edu.au |quote=([[Harold Crouch]]) |access-date=2013-12-06 }}</ref>\n\nThe New Order also implemented the ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' (\"Dual Function\") policy which enabled the military to have an active role in all levels of the Indonesian government, economy, and society.\n\n===Consolidation of power===\n{{See also|Acting presidency of Suharto}}\n\n[[File:Jenderal TNI Soeharto.png|thumb|upright|Official portrait during Suharto's acting presidency]]\n[[File:Suhartoappointedpresident.jpg|thumb|Suharto taking the presidential oath of office, 27 March 1968]]\n\nHaving been appointed president, Suharto still needed to share power with various elements including Indonesian generals who considered Suharto as mere ''[[primus inter pares]]'', and Islamic and student groups who participated in the anti-Communist purge. Suharto, aided by his \"Office of Personal Assistants\" (''[[Aspri]]'') clique of military officers from his days as commander of Diponegoro Division, particularly [[Ali Murtopo]], began to systematically cement his hold on power by subtly sidelining potential rivals while rewarding loyalists with political position and monetary incentives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nHaving successfully stood-down MPRS chairman General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Nasution]]'s 1968 attempt to introduce a bill which would have severely curtailed presidential authority, Suharto had him removed from his position as MPRS chairman in 1969 and forced his early retirement from the military in 1972. In 1967, generals [[Hartono Rekso Dharsono]], [[Kemal Idris]], and [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] (dubbed \"New Order Radicals\") opposed Suharto's decision to allow participation of existing political parties in elections in favour of a non-ideological two-party system similar to those found in many Western countries. Suharto sent Dharsono overseas as an ambassador, while Idris and Wibowo were sent to distant [[North Sumatra]] and [[South Sulawesi]] as regional commanders.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, p. 56-59</ref>\n\nSuharto's previously strong relationship with the student movement soured over the increasing authoritarianism and corruption of his regime. While many original leaders of the 1966 student movement (''Angkatan '66'') were successfully co-opted into the regime, Suharto was faced with large student demonstrations challenging the legitimacy of 1971 elections (\"''Golput''\" movement), the costly construction of the [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]] theme park (1972), the domination of foreign capitalists ([[Malari Incident]] of 1974), and the lack of term limits of Suharto's presidency (1978). The regime responded by imprisoning many student activists (such as future national figures [[Dorodjatun Kuntjoro-Jakti]], [[Adnan Buyung Nasution]], Hariman Siregar, and [[Syahrir]]), and even sending  troops to occupy the campus of ITB ([[Bandung Institute of Technology]]) from January\u2013March 1978. In April 1978, Suharto moved decisively by issuing a decree on \"Normalisation of Campus Life\" (NKK) which prohibited political activities on-campus not related to academic pursuits.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, pp. 60\u201368</ref><ref>Aspinal (1999), p.ii</ref>\n\nOn 15\u201316 January 1974, Suharto faced a significant challenge when violent riots broke out in [[Jakarta]] during a visit by the Japanese prime minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]]. Students demonstrating against increasing dominance of Japanese investors were encouraged by General [[Sumitro]], deputy commander of the armed forces. Sumitro was an ambitious general who disliked the strong influence of Suharto's Aspri inner circle. Suharto learned that the riots were engineered by Sumitro to destabilise the regime, resulting in Sumitro's dismissal and forced retirement. This incident is referred to as the [[Malari incident|Malari Incident (''Malapetaka Lima Belas Januari'' / Disaster of 15 January)]]. However, Suharto also disbanded Aspri to appease popular dissent.<ref>[http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0904/18/0802.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507025707/http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0904/18/0802.htm|date=7 May 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, fifty prominent political figures signed the [[Petition of Fifty]], which criticised Suharto's use of Pancasila to silence his critics. Suharto refused to address the petitioners' concerns, and some of them were imprisoned with others having restrictions imposed on their movements.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, pp. 86\u201388</ref>\n\n===Domestic politics and security===\n[[File:President Suharto, 1973 (full).jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto's official photo for his second term]]\n{{see also|Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Papua conflict}}\nTo placate demands from civilian politicians for the holding of elections, as manifested in MPRS resolutions of 1966 and 1967, Suharto government formulated a series of laws regarding elections as well as the structure and duties of parliament which were passed by MPRS in November 1969 after protracted negotiations. The law provided for a [[People's Consultative Assembly|parliament (''Madjelis Permusjawaratan Rakjat''/MPR)]] with the power to elect presidents, consisting of a lower house ([[People's Representative Council|''Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat''/DPR]]) and regional representatives. 100 of the 460 members of DPR will be directly appointed by the government, while the remaining seats were allocated to political parties based on results of a general election. This mechanism ensures significant government control over legislative affairs, particularly the appointment of presidents.<ref>Ricklefs (1982), p.76\u201377</ref><ref>Elson (2001), p.184\u2013186</ref>\n\nTo participate in the elections, Suharto realised the need to align himself with a political party. After initially considering alignment with Sukarno's old party the [[Indonesian National Party|PNI]], in 1969 Suharto decided to take over control of an obscure military-run federation of NGOs called [[Golkar]] (\"Functional Groups\") and transform it into his electoral vehicle under the coordination of his right-hand man [[Ali Murtopo]]. The [[1971 Indonesian legislative election|first general election]] was held on 3 July 1971 with ten participants; consisting of [[Golkar]], four Islamic parties, as well as five nationalist and Christian parties. Campaigning on a non-ideological platform of \"development\", and aided by official government support and subtle intimidation tactics, [[Golkar]] managed to secure 62.8% of the popular vote. The March 1973 general session of newly elected MPR promptly appointed Suharto to second-term in office with Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] as vice-president.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p. 32</ref>\n{{Quote|text=\"It is not the military strength of the Communists but their fanaticism and ideology which is the principal element of their strength.

The government ensured that these parties never developed effective opposition by controlling their leadership while establishing the \"re-call\" system to remove any outspoken legislators from their positions. Using this system dubbed the \"[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] Democracy\", Suharto was re-elected unopposed by the MPR in 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p.32</ref> Golkar won landslide majorities in the MPR at every election, ensuring that Suharto would be able to pass his agenda with virtually no opposition. Ultimately, he held all governing power in the country.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nSuharto proceeded with various social engineering projects designed to transform Indonesian society into a de-politicised \"floating mass\" supportive of the national mission of \"development\", a concept similar to [[corporatism]]. The government formed various civil society groups to unite the populace in support of government programs. For instance, the government created the [[Indonesian National Civil Service Corps]] (''Korps Pegawai Republik Indonesia'' or ''Korpri'') in November 1971 as union of civil servants to ensure their loyalty, organised the FBSI (''Federasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia'') as the only legal labour union in February 1973, and established the [[Indonesian Ulema Council|MUI]] in 1975 to control Islamic clerics. In 1966 to 1967, to promote [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the influential [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese-Indonesians]], the Suharto government passed [[Legislation on Chinese Indonesians|several laws]] as part of so-called \"Basic Policy for the Solution of Chinese Problem\", whereby only one Chinese-language publication (controlled by the Army) was allowed to continue, all Chinese cultural and religious expressions (including display of Chinese characters) were [[Sinophobia|prohibited]] from public space, Chinese schools were phased-out, and the ethnic-Chinese were forced to take-up [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Indonesian-sounding names]]; creating a systematic [[cultural genocide]]. In 1968, Suharto commenced the highly successful family-planning program (''Keluarga Berentjana / KB'') to stem the high population growth rate and hence increasing per-capita income. A lasting legacy from this period is the spelling reform of Indonesian language decreed by Suharto on 17 August 1972.<ref>Schwartz (1994), page 106</ref>\n\n[[File:Re-enactment Santa Cruz massacre.jpg|thumb|right|A re-enactment of the [[Santa Cruz massacre]] of at least 250 [[East Timor]]ese pro-independence demonstrators during the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]].]] \nSuharto relied on the military to ruthlessly maintain domestic security, organised by the [[Kopkamtib]] (Operation Command for the Restoration of Security and Order) and BAKIN (State Intelligence Coordination Agency). To maintain strict control over the country, Suharto expanded the army's territorial system down to village-level, while military officers were appointed as regional heads under the rubric of the ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' (\"Dual Function\") of the military. By 1969, 70% of Indonesia's provincial governors and more than half of its district chiefs were active military officers. Suharto authorised ''Operasi Trisula'' which destroyed PKI-remnants trying to organise a guerrilla base in [[Blitar]] area in 1968 and ordered several military operations that ended the communist PGRS-Paraku insurgency in [[West Kalimantan]] (1967\u20131972). Attacks on oil workers by the first incarnation of [[Free Aceh Movement]] separatists under [[Hasan di Tiro]] in 1977 led to the dispatch of small special forces detachments who quickly either killed or forced the movement's members to flee abroad.<ref>Conboy (2003), p. 262\u2013265</ref> Notably, on March 1981, Suharto authorised a successful special forces mission to end [[Garuda Indonesia Flight 206|hijacking of a Garuda Indonesia flight]] by Islamic extremists at [[Don Muang Airport]] in [[Bangkok]].<ref>Elson (2001), p. 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nTo comply with [[New York Agreement]] of 1962 which required a plebiscite on the integration of [[West Irian]] into Indonesia before the end of 1969, the Suharto government begin organising for a so-called \"[[Act of Free Choice]]\" scheduled for July\u2013August 1969. The government sent RPKAD special forces under [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] which secured the surrender of several bands of former Dutch-organised militia (''[[Papuan Volunteer Corps|Papoea Vrijwilligers Korps / PVK]]'') at large in the jungles since the Indonesian takeover in 1963 while sending Catholic volunteers under [[Jusuf Wanandi]] to distribute consumer goods to promote pro-Indonesian sentiments. In March 1969, it was agreed that the plebiscite would be channelled via 1,025 tribal chiefs, citing the logistical challenge and political ignorance of the population. Using the above strategy, the plebiscite produced a unanimous decision for integration with Indonesia, which was duly noted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in November 1969.<ref>Elson (2001), p. 178\u2013279</ref>\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F032437-0030, Berchtesgaden, Staatsbesuch Pr\u00e4sident Suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto on a visit to [[West Germany]] in 1970.]]\n[[File:Suharto 1978.jpg|thumb|Suharto's official portrait for his third term (1978\u20131983)]]\n\nTo stabilise the economy and to ensure long-term support for the New Order, Suharto's administration enlisted a group of mostly US-educated Indonesian economists, dubbed the \"[[Berkeley Mafia]]\", to formulate significant changes in economic policy. By cutting subsidies, decreasing government debt, and reforming the exchange rate mechanism, inflation was lowered from 660% in 1966 to 19% in 1969. The threat of famine was alleviated by the influx of [[USAID]] rice aid shipments from 1967 to 1968.<ref>J. Panglaykim and K.D. Thomas, \"The New Order and the Economy,\" Indonesia, April 1967, p. 73.</ref>\n\nWith a lack of domestic capital that was required for economic growth, the New Order reversed Sukarno's economic self-sufficiency policies and opened selected economic sectors of the country to foreign investment through the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. Suharto travelled to Western Europe and Japan to promote investment in Indonesia. The first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia included mining companies [[Freeport-McMoran|Freeport Sulphur Company]] / [[International Nickel Company]]. Following government regulatory frameworks, domestic entrepreneurs (mostly Chinese-Indonesians) emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the import-substitution light-manufacturing sector such as [[Astra Group]] and [[Salim Group]].<ref name=\"Robinson 2012, p. 178-203\">Robinson (2012), p. 178\u2013203</ref>\n\nFrom 1967, the government secured low-interest foreign aid from ten countries grouped under the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) to cover its budget deficit.<ref>Elson (2001), p. 170\u2013172</ref> With the IGGI funds and the later jump in oil export revenue from the [[1973 oil crisis]], the government invested in infrastructure under a series of five-year plans, dubbed REPELITA (''Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun'') I to VI from 1969 to 1998.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /><ref name=\"Robinson 2012, p. 178-203\"/><ref name=\"Sheridan-theaustralian\">\n{{cite news| last = Sheridan| first = Greg| title = Farewell to Jakarta's Man of Steel|work=The Australian| date = 28 January 2008| url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/farewell-to-jakartas-man-of-steel/story-e6frg6v6-1111115412423| accessdate =14 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nOutside the formal economy, Suharto created a network of charitable organisations (\"''yayasan''\") run by the military and his family members, which extracted \"donations\" from domestic and foreign enterprises in exchange for necessary government support and permits.

Western countries, impressed by Suharto's strong anti-communist credentials, were quick to offer their support. [[China-Indonesia relations|Diplomatic relations]] with China were suspended in October 1967 due to suspicion of Chinese involvement in the [[30 September Movement]] (diplomatic relations was only restored in 1990). Due to Suharto's destruction of PKI, the [[Soviet Union]] embargoed military sales to Indonesia. However, from 1967 to 1970 foreign minister [[Adam Malik]] managed to secure several agreements to restructure massive debts incurred by Sukarno from the Soviet Union and other Eastern European communist states. Regionally, having ended confrontation with [[Malaysia]] in August 1966, Indonesia became a founding member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in August 1967. This organisation is designed to establish a peaceful relationship between Southeast Asian countries free from conflicts such as the ongoing [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n\nIn 1974, the neighbouring colony of [[Portuguese Timor]] descended into civil war after the withdrawal of Portuguese authority following the [[Carnation Revolution]], whereby the left-wing populist [[Fretilin]] (''Frente Revolucion\u00e1ria de Timor-Leste Independente'') emerged triumphant. With approval from Western countries (including from US president [[Gerald Ford]] and Australian prime minister [[Gough Whitlam]] during their visits to Indonesia), Suharto decided to intervene claiming to prevent the establishment of a communist state. After an unsuccessful attempt of covert support to Timorese groups [[Timorese Democratic Union|UDT]] and [[APODETI]], Suharto authorised a full-scale [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] of the colony on 7 December 1975 followed with its official annexation as Indonesia's 27th province of [[East Timor]] in July 1976. The \"encirclement and annihilation\" campaigns of 1977\u20131979 broke the back of Fretilin control over the hinterlands, although continuing guerrilla resistance caused the government to maintain a strong military force in the half-island until 1999. An estimated minimum of 90,800 and maximum of 213,600 conflict-related deaths occurred in East Timor during [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian rule (1974\u20131999)]]; namely, 17,600\u201319,600 killings and 73,200 to 194,000 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness, although Indonesian forces were responsible for about 70% of the violent killings.<ref>{{cite web |author=Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group |title=The Profile of Human Rights Violations in Timor-Leste, 1974\u20131999 |work=A Report to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste |publisher=Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) |date=9 February 2006 |url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65eZ8hHJe?url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |archive-date=22 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Indonesia's [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]] of [[East Timor]] during Suharto's presidency resulted in at least 100,000 deaths.<ref>[[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor]] {{cite web |author=Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group |title=The Profile of Human Rights Violations in Timor-Leste, 1974\u20131999 |work=A Report to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste |publisher=Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) |date=9 February 2006 |url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65eZ8hHJe?url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |archive-date=22 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Socio-economic progress and growing corruption===\n[[File:President Suharto, 1983.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Suharto's official portrait for his fourth term (1983\u20131988). Early into this term, Suharto was bestowed the title \"Father of Development\" by the [[People's Consultative Assembly|Parliament]] due to his \"development projects\".]]\nReal socio-economic progress sustained support for Suharto's regime across three decades. By 1996, Indonesia's poverty rate has dropped to around 11% compared with 45% in 1970. From 1966 to 1997, Indonesia recorded real GDP growth of 5.03% pa, pushing real GDP per capita upwards from US$806 to US$4,114. In 1966, the manufacturing sector made up less than 10% of GDP (mostly industries related to oil and agriculture). By 1997, manufacturing had risen to 25% of GDP, and 53% of exports consisted of manufactured products. The government invested in massive infrastructure development (notably the launching of a series of [[Palapa]] telecommunication satellites); consequently, Indonesian infrastructure in the mid-1990s was considered at par with China. Suharto was keen to capitalise on such achievements to justify his regime, and an [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] resolution in 1983 granted him the title of \"Father of Development\".<ref>Rock (2003), p.3</ref>\n\nSuharto government's health-care programs (such as the ''Puskesmas'' program) increased life expectancy from 47 years (1966) to 67 years (1997) while cutting infant mortality rate by more than 60%. The government's ''Inpres'' program launched in 1973 resulted in primary school enrolment ratio reaching 90% by 1983 while almost eliminating the education gap between boys and girls. Sustained support for agriculture resulted in Indonesia achieving rice self-sufficiency by 1984, an unprecedented achievement which earned Suharto a gold medal from the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] in November 1985.<ref>Rock (2003), p.4</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Suharto government responded to the fall in oil exports due to the [[1980s oil glut]] by successfully shifting the basis of the economy to export-oriented labour-intensive manufacturing, made globally competitive by Indonesia's low wages and a series of currency devaluations. Industrialisation was mostly undertaken by [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese-Indonesian]] companies which evolved into large conglomerates dominating the nation's economy. The largest of these conglomerates were the [[Salim Group]] led by [[Liem Sioe Liong|Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim)]], [[Sinar Mas Group]] led by [[Eka Tjipta Widjaja|Oei Ek Tjong (Eka Tjipta Widjaja)]], [[Astra Group]] led by [[William Soeryadjaya|Tjia Han Poen (William Soeryadjaya)]], [[Lippo Group]] led by [[Mochtar Riady|Lie Mo Tie (Mochtar Riady)]], Barito Pacific Group led by [[Prajogo Pangestu|Pang Djun Phen (Prajogo Pangestu)]], and Nusamba Group led by [[Bob Hasan]]. Suharto decided to support the growth of a small number of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates since they would not pose a political challenge due to their ethnic-minority status, but from his experience, he deemed them to possess the skills and capital needed to create real growth for the country. In exchange for Suharto's patronage, the conglomerates provided vital financing for his \"regime maintenance\" activities.<ref name=\"Deepblue.lib.umich.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/40018/wp632.pdf?sequence=3|title=The Politics of Development Policy and Development Policy Reform in New Order Indonesia |publisher=Deepblue.lib.umich.edu|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Suharto government decided to de-regulate the banking sector to encourage savings and providing a domestic source of financing required for growth. Suharto decreed the \"October Package of 1988\" (''PAKTO 88'') which eased requirements for establishing banks and extending credit; resulting in a 50% increase in the number of banks from 1989 to 1991. To promote savings, the government introduced the ''TABANAS'' program to the populace. The [[Jakarta Stock Exchange]], re-opened in 1977, recorded a \"bull run\", due to a spree of domestic [[Initial Public Offering|IPOs]] and an influx of foreign funds after the deregulation in 1990. The sudden availability of credit fuelled robust economic growth in the early 1990s, but the weak regulatory environment of the financial sector sowed the seeds of the catastrophic crisis in 1997, which eventually destroyed Suharto's regime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bi.go.id/NR/rdonlyres/A6011CBA-1B4E-49B1-9DDC-CB01AB6C60D0/19386/SejarahPerbankanPeriode19831997.pdf|title=Bank Indonesia|publisher=Bi.go.id|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe growth of the economy coincided with the rapid expansion of corruption, collusion, and nepotism (''Korupsi, Kolusi, dan Nepotisme / KKN''). In the early 1980s, Suharto's children, particularly [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana]] (\"Tutut\"), [[Tommy Suharto|Hutomo Mandala Putra (\"Tommy\")]], and Bambang Trihatmodjo, had grown into greedy adults. Their companies were given lucrative government contracts and protected from market competition by monopolies. Examples include the [[List of toll roads in Indonesia|toll-expressway]] market which was monopolised by Tutut, the national car project monopolised by Bambang and Tommy, and even the cinema market, monopolised by [[21 Cineplex]] (owned by Suharto's cousin Sudwikatmono). The family is said to control about 36,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of real estate in Indonesia, including 100,000&nbsp;m\u00b2 of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40% of the land in East Timor. Additionally, Suharto's family members received free shares in 1,251 of Indonesia's most lucrative domestic companies (mostly run by Suharto's ethnic-Chinese cronies), while foreign-owned companies were encouraged to establish \"strategic partnerships\" with Suharto family companies. Meanwhile, the myriad of ''yayasan''s run by the Suharto family grew even larger, levying millions of dollars in \"donations\" from the public and private sectors each year.<ref name=\"BBC_20040325\"/><ref name=\"Global Corruption Report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report|publisher=Transparency International |accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2004, the German anti-corruption NGO Transparency International released a list of what it believed to be the ten most self-enriching leaders in the previous two decades; in order of amount allegedly stolen in USD, the highest-ranking of these was Suharto and his family who are alleged to have embezzled $15 billion \u2013 $35 billion.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4450/26759/file/GCR_2004_press_release_FINAL.pdf|title=Plundering politicians and bribing multinationals undermine economic development, says TI|publisher=Transparency International|date=25 March 2004|accessdate=21 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The New Order in the 1980s and 1990s===\n[[File:President Suharto, 1988.jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto's official portrait for his fifth term (1988\u20131993)]]\n[[File:William cohen with suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto with [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]], 14 January 1998.]]\nBy the 1980s, Suharto's grip on power was maintained by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, and use of the military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani]] as head of the armed forces who adopted a hard-line approach on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.<ref>Elson (2001), p.457-460</ref>\n\nFrom 1983 to 1985, army squads killed up to 10,000 suspected criminals in response to a spike in the crime rate (see \"[[Petrus Killings]]\"). Suharto's imposition of Pancasila as the sole ideology caused protests from conservative Islamic groups who considered Islamic law to be above all other conceptions. The [[Tanjung Priok massacre]] saw the army kill up to 100 conservative Muslim protesters in September 1984. A retaliatory series of small bombings, including the bombing of [[Borobudur]], led to arrests of hundreds of conservative Islamic activists, including future parliamentary leader AM Fatwa and [[Abu Bakar Bashir]] (later leader of [[Jemaah Islamiyah]]). Attacks on police by a resurgent [[Free Aceh Movement]] in 1989 led to a military operation which killed 2,000 people and ended the insurgency by 1992. In 1984, the Suharto government sought increased control over the press by issuing a law requiring all media to possess a press operating  license (''SIUPP'') which could be revoked at any time by Ministry of Information.<ref>Aspinal (1999), pp. ii\u2013iii</ref>\n\nWestern concern over communism waned with the end of the [[Cold War]], and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny, particularly following the 1991 [[Santa Cruz Massacre]] in East Timor. Suharto was elected as head of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1992, while Indonesia became a founding member of [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] in 1989 and host to the [[Bogor]] APEC Summit in 1994.<ref>Elson (2001), p.510\u2013511</ref>\n\nDomestically, the business dealings of Suharto's family created discontent amongst the military who lost access to power and lucrative rent-seeking opportunities. The March 1988 [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] session, military legislators attempted to pressure Suharto by unsuccessfully seeking to block the nomination of [[Sudharmono]], a Suharto-loyalist, as vice-president. Moerdani's criticism of the Suharto family's corruption saw the president dismiss him from the position of military chief. Suharto proceeded to slowly \"de-militarise\" his regime; he dissolved the powerful [[Kopkamtib]] in September 1988 and ensured key military positions were held by loyalists.<ref>Pour (2007), p.242\u2013264</ref>\n\n[[File:Suharto and wife after hajj.jpg|256px|left|thumb|Suharto and his wife in Islamic attire after performing hajj in 1991]]\nIn an attempt to diversify his power base away from the military, Suharto began courting support from Islamic elements. He undertook a much-publicised [[hajj]] pilgrimage in 1991, took up the name of Haji Mohammad Suharto, and promoted Islamic values and the careers of Islamic-oriented generals. To win support from the nascent Muslim business community who resented the dominance of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates, Suharto formed the ICMI (Indonesian Islamic Intellectuals' Association) in November 1990, which was led by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[BJ Habibie]], the Minister for Research and Technology since 1978. During this period, race riots against ethnic-Chinese begin to occur quite regularly, beginning with April 1994 riot in [[Medan]].<ref name=\"Elson 2001, p.211-214\">Elson (2001), p.211-214</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s, Suharto's government came to be dominated by civilian politicians such as [[B. J. Habibie|Habibie]], [[Harmoko]], [[Ginandjar Kartasasmita]], and [[Akbar Tanjung]], who owed their position solely to Suharto. As a sign of Habibie's growing clout, when two prominent Indonesian magazines and a tabloid newspaper reported on criticism over Habibie's purchase of almost the entire fleet of the disbanded [[East German Navy]] in 1993 (most of the vessels were of scrap-value), the Ministry of Information ordered the offending publications be closed down on 21 June 1994.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Steele|first1=Janet|title=Wars Within: The Story of Tempo, an Independent Magazine in Soeharto's Indonesia|date=2005|publisher=Equinox Publishing|isbn=9793780088|pages=234\u2013235 |edition=First}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Suharto with military uniform, 1997.jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto with five-star rank on his shoulders]]\nIn the 1990s, elements within the growing Indonesian middle class created by Suharto's economic development were becoming restless with his autocracy and the corruption of his children, fuelling demands for \"[[Post-Suharto era|Reformasi]]\" (reform) of the almost 30-year-old New Order government. By 1996, [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], the daughter of [[Sukarno]] and chairwoman of the normally compliant [[Indonesian Democratic Party|PDI]], was becoming a rallying point for this growing discontent. In response, Suharto backed a co-opted faction of PDI led by [[Suryadi (politician)|Suryadi]], which removed Megawati from the chair. On 27 July 1996, an attack by soldiers and hired thugs led by Lieutenant-General [[Sutiyoso]] on demonstrating Megawati supporters in Jakarta resulted in fatal riots and looting. This incident was followed by the arrest of 200 democracy activists, 23 of whom were kidnapped, and some killed, by army squads led by Suharto's son-in-law, Major-General [[Prabowo Subianto]].<ref>Elson (2001), p. 284-287</ref>\n\n===Economic crisis and resignation===\n{{Main|Fall of Suharto}}\n[[File:Suharto resigns.jpg|thumb|Suharto reads his resignation speech at Merdeka Palace on 21 May 1998.

From mid-1997 there were large capital outflows and against the US dollar. Due to poor bank lending practices, many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah. The weakening rupiah spurred panic buying of US dollar by these companies, causing the [[Indonesian rupiah]] to drop in value from a pre-crisis level of Rp. 2,600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp. 17,000. Consequently, many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13.7%, leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country.<ref name=\"CountryBrief\">{{cite web |title=Indonesia: Country Brief |work=Indonesia:Key Development Data & Statistics |publisher=The World Bank |date=September 2006 |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/INDONESIAEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20095968~pagePK:141137~piPK:141127~theSitePK:226309,00.html}}</ref> Efforts by the [[Bank Indonesia|central bank]] to defend the rupiah proved futile and only drained the country's dollar reserves. In exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, between October 1997 and the following April, Suharto signed three letters of intent with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) for an economic reform process. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits and set-up the [[Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency]] to take over management of troubled banks in order to prevent the collapse of the financial system. Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation, the government raised an interest rate up to 70% pa in February 1998, which further worsened the contraction of the economy.\n\nIn December 1997, Suharto did not attend an ASEAN presidents' summit for the first time, which was later revealed to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the immediate future of his presidency. In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to re-assert his authority and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing rupiah.<ref>Friend (2003), p. 313.</ref> However, his attempts to re-instil confidence had little effect. Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the most stringent requirements of the IMF reform process, further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership.<ref>Monash Asia Institute (1999), p. v.</ref>\n\n[[File:President Suharto, 1998.png|thumb|upright|Suharto's official portrait for his seventh term (1998)]]\nThe economic meltdown was accompanied by increasing political tension. Anti-Chinese riots occurred in [[Situbondo]] (1996), [[Tasikmalaya]] (1996), [[Banjarmasin]] (1997), and [[Makassar]] (1997); while violent ethnic clashes broke out between the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] settlers in [[Central Kalimantan]] in 1997. [[Golkar]] won the rigged [[1997 Indonesian elections|1997 election]], and in March 1998, Suharto was voted unanimously to another five-year term. He nominated his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[B. J. Habibie]] as vice president then stacking the [[Seventh Development Cabinet|cabinet]] with his own family and business associates, including his eldest daughter [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana|Tutut]] as Minister of Social Affairs. The appointments and the government's unrealistic 1998 budget created further currency instability,<ref name=\"Friend 2003, p. 314\">Friend (2003), p. 314.</ref> rumours and panic led to a run on stores and pushed up prices.<ref>Friend (2003), p. 314; Monash Asia Institute (1999), p. v</ref> The government increased the fuel prices further by 70% in May 1998, which triggered another wave of riots in [[Medan]].<ref>Purdey (2006), p. 115</ref>\n\nWith Suharto increasingly seen as the source of the country's mounting economic and political crises, prominent political figures, including Muslim politician [[Amien Rais]], spoke out against his presidency, and in January 1998 university students began organising nationwide demonstrations.<ref>Elson (2001), p.267</ref> The crisis climaxed while Suharto was on a state visit to Egypt on 12 May 1998, when security forces [[Trisakti shootings|killed four demonstrators]] from Jakarta's [[Trisakti University]]. [[Indonesian riots of May 1998|Rioting and looting across Jakarta and other cities]] over the following days destroyed thousands of buildings and killed over 1,000 people. Ethnic Chinese and their businesses were particular targets in the violence. Theories on the origin of the violence include rivalry between military chief General [[Wiranto]] and [[Commander of Army Strategic Command (Indonesia)|Army Strategic Commander]] Lt. Gen. [[Prabowo Subianto]], and the suggestion of deliberate provocation by Suharto to divert blame for the crisis to the ethnic-Chinese and discredit the student movement.<ref>Purdey (2006), p.148-150</ref>\n\nOn 16 May, tens of thousands of university students demanded Suharto's resignation, occupied the grounds and roof of [[DPR/MPR Building|the parliament building]]. Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he offered to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet. These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet. According to Wiranto, on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him to take any measures to restore security; however, Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population.<ref>Wiranto (2003), p.67-69</ref> On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president Habibie assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /><ref name=\"Vickers 2005, pp. 203\u2013207\">Vickers (2005), pp. 203\u2013207.</ref><ref>E.

However, in September court-appointed doctors announced that he could not stand trial because of his declining health. State prosecutors tried again in 2002, but then doctors cited an unspecified brain disease. On 26 March 2008, a civil court judge acquitted Suharto of corruption but ordered his charitable foundation, Supersemar, to pay US$110&nbsp;m (\u00a355&nbsp;m).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7315976.stm |title=Suharto charity told to pay $110&nbsp;m| publisher=BBC News | date=27 March 2008 | accessdate=6 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Suharto's son [[Tommy Suharto|Tommy]] was sentenced to 15 years' jail for ordering the killing of a judge (who had previously convicted him of corruption), illegal weapons possession and fleeing justice.

At the age of three, Suharto was returned to his mother, who had married a local farmer whom Suharto helped in the rice paddies.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 10\" /> In 1929, Suharto's father took him to live with his sister, who was married to an agricultural supervisor, Prawirowihardjo, in the town of Wuryantoro in a poor and low-yielding farming area near [[Wonogiri]]. Over the following two years, he was taken back to his mother in Kemusuk by his stepfather and then back again to Wuryantoro by his father.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 11\">McDonald (1980), p. 11.</ref>\n\nPrawirowihardjo took to raising the boy as his own, which provided Suharto with a father-figure and a stable home in Wuryantoro. In 1931, he moved to the town of Wonogiri to attend the primary school, living first with Prawirohardjo's son Sulardi, and later with his father's relative Hardjowijono. While living with Hardjowijono, Suharto became acquainted with Darjatmo, a ''dukun'' (\"shaman\") of Javanese mystical arts and faith healing. The experience deeply affected him and later, as president, Suharto surrounded himself with powerful symbolic language.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /> Difficulties in paying the fees for his education in Wonogiri resulted in another move back to his father in Kemusuk, where he continued studying at a lower-fee [[Muhammadiyah]] middle school in the city of [[Yogyakarta]] until 1939.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 11\" /><ref name=\"ELSON1\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 1\u20136 }}</ref>\n\nLike many Javanese, Suharto had [[Javanese name|only one name]].<ref name=globe>Haskin, Colin, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/article663945.ece \"Suharto dead at 86\"]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, ''The Globe and Mail'', 27 January 2008</ref> In religious contexts in recent years he has sometimes been called \"[[Hajji|Haji]]\" or \"el-Haj Mohammed Suharto\", but these names were not part of his formal name or generally used. The spelling \"Suharto\" reflects modern Indonesian spelling, although the general approach in Indonesia is to rely on the spelling preferred by the person concerned. At the time of his birth, the standard transcription was \"Soeharto\", but he preferred the original spelling. The international English-language press generally uses the spelling 'Suharto' while the Indonesian government and media use 'Soeharto'.<ref>{{cite book | title=Politics and the press in Indonesia | last=Romano | first=Angela Rose | page=ix | year=2003 | isbn=0-7007-1745-5}}</ref>\n\nSuharto's upbringing contrasts with that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as [[Sukarno]] in that he is believed to have had little interest in [[anti-colonialism]], or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little or no contact with European colonisers. Consequently, he did not learn to speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or other European languages in his youth. He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.<ref name=\"ELSON1\"/>\n\n==Military career==\n{{Main|Early life and career of Suharto}}\n\n===World War II and Japanese occupation===\n{{See also|Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies}}\n\nSuharto finished middle school at the age of 18 and took a clerical job at a bank in Wuryantaro. He was forced to resign after a bicycle mishap tore his only working clothes.<ref>McDonald (1980), pages 12\u201313</ref> Following a spell of unemployment, he joined the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) in June 1940 and undertook basic training in [[Gombong]] near Yogyakarta. With the Netherlands under German occupation and the Japanese pressing for access to Indonesian oil supplies, the Dutch had opened up the KNIL to large intakes of previously excluded Javanese.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, pages 13\">McDonald (1980), pages 13</ref> Suharto was assigned to Battalion XIII at Rampal, graduated from a short training course at KNIL ''Kaderschool'' in [[Gombong]] to become a sergeant, and was posted to a KNIL reserve battalion in [[Cisarua]].<ref name=\"ELSON2\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| page=8 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Dutch surrender to the [[Dutch East Indies Campaign|invading Japanese forces]] in March 1942, Suharto abandoned his KNIL uniform and went back to Wurjantoro. After months of unemployment, he then became one of the thousands of Indonesians who took the opportunity to join Japanese-organised security forces by joining the Yogyakarta police force.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, pages 13\" /> In October 1943, Suharto was transferred from the police force to the newly formed Japanese-sponsored militia, the [[Pembela Tanah Air|PETA]] (Defenders of the Fatherland) in which Indonesians served as officers. In his training to serve with the rank of ''shodancho'' (platoon commander) he encountered a localised version of the Japanese ''[[bushido]]'', or \"way of the warrior\", used to indoctrinate troops. This training encouraged an anti-Dutch and pro-nationalist thought, although toward the aims of the Imperial Japanese militarists. The encounter with a nationalistic and militarist ideology is believed to have profoundly influenced Suharto's own way of thinking.<ref name=\"ELSON3\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| page = 9 }}</ref>\n\nSuharto was posted to a PETA coastal defence battalion at [[Wates, Kulon Progo|Wates]], south of Yogyakarta until he was admitted for training for company commander (''chudancho'') in [[Bogor]] from April to August 1944. As company commander, he conducted training for new PETA recruits in [[Surakarta]], [[Jakarta]], and [[Madiun]]. The Japanese surrender and [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence]] in August 1945 occurred while Suharto was posted to the remote Brebeg area (on the slopes of [[Mount Wilis]]) to train new NCOs to replace those executed by the Japanese in the aftermath of the failed February [[1945 PETA Revolt in Blitar]], led by [[Supriyadi]].\n\n===Indonesian National Revolution===\n{{See also|Indonesian National Revolution}}\n\nTwo days after the Japanese surrender in the Pacific, independence leaders [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]] [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|declared Indonesian independence]] and were appointed President and Vice-President respectively of the new Republic. Suharto disbanded his regiment under orders from the Japanese command and returned to Yogyakarta.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 14\">McDonald (1980), p. 14.</ref> As republican groups rose to assert Indonesian independence, Suharto joined a new unit of the newly formed Indonesian army. Based on his PETA experience, he was appointed deputy commander, and subsequently, a battalion commander when the republican forces were formally organised in October 1945.<ref name=\"McDonald 1980, p. 14\" /> Suharto was involved in fighting against Allied troops around [[Magelang]] and [[Semarang]] and was subsequently appointed the head of a brigade as lieutenant-colonel, having earned respect as a field commander.<ref>McDonald (1980), p. 16.</ref> In the early years of the War, he organised local armed forces into Battalion X of Regiment I; Suharto was promoted to Major and became Battalion X's leader.<ref name=\"ELSON4\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 14\u201315 }}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of the Allies, under a mandate to return the situation to the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'', quickly led to clashes between Indonesian republicans and Allied forces, i.e. returning Dutch and assisting British forces. Suharto led his Division X troops to halt an advance by the Dutch T (\"Tiger\") Brigade on 17 May 1946. It earned him the respect of Lieutenant-Colonel Sunarto Kusumodirjo, who invited him to draft the working guidelines for the Battle Leadership Headquarters (MPP), a body created to organise and unify the command structure of the Indonesian Nationalist forces.<ref name=\"ELSON5\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 15\u201317 }}</ref> The military forces of the still infant Republic of Indonesia were constantly restructuring. By August 1946, Suharto was head of the 22nd Regiment of Division III (the \"[[Kodam IV/Diponegoro|Diponegoro Division]]\") stationed in Yogyakarta. In late 1946, the Diponegoro Division assumed responsibility for the defence of the west and southwest of [[Yogyakarta]] from Dutch forces. Conditions at the time are reported by Dutch sources as miserable; Suharto himself is reported as assisting smuggling syndicates in the transport of [[opium]] through the territory he controlled, to generate income. In September 1948, Suharto was dispatched to meet [[Musso]], chairman of the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI) in an unsuccessful attempt at a peaceful reconciliation of the [[Madiun Affair|communist uprising in Madiun]].<ref name=\"ELSON6\" />\n\n[[File:Lieutenant Colonel Suharto.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lieutenant Colonel Suharto in 1947]]\n\nIn December 1948, the Dutch launched \"[[Operatie Kraai|Operation Crow]]\", which resulted in the capture of Sukarno and Hatta and the capital [[Yogyakarta]].

However, General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Abdul Nasution]] said that Suharto took great care in preparing the \"General Offensive\" ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] ''Serangan Umum''). Civilians sympathetic to the Republican cause within the city had been galvanised by the show of force which proved that the Dutch had failed to win the guerrilla war. Internationally, the United Nations Security Council pressured the Dutch to cease the military offensive and to recommence negotiations, which eventually led to the Dutch withdrawal from Yogyakarta area in June 1949 and to complete transfer of sovereignty in December 1949. Suharto was responsible for the takeover of Yogyakarta city from the withdrawing Dutch in June 1949.<ref>{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 29\u201338, 42\u201344 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the Revolution, Suharto married [[Siti Hartinah]] (known as Madam Tien), the daughter of a minor noble in the Mangkunegaran royal house of Solo. The arranged marriage was enduring and supportive, lasting until Tien's death in 1996.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /> The couple had six children: [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana]] (Tutut, born 1949), Sigit Harjojudanto (born 1951), Bambang Trihatmodjo (born 1953), Siti Hediati (\"[[Titiek Suharto]]\", born 1959), [[Hutomo Mandala Putra]] (Tommy, born 1962), and Siti Hutami Endang Adiningish (Mamiek, born 1964). Within the Javanese upper class, it was considered acceptable for the wife to pursue genteel commerce{{clarify|date=April 2014}} to supplement the family budget, allowing her husband to keep his dignity in his official role.

This formed the military side of the campaign to win [[western New Guinea]] from the Dutch, who were preparing it for its own independence, separate from Indonesia.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /> In 1965, Suharto was assigned operational command of Sukarno's ''[[Konfrontasi]]'', against the newly formed Malaysia. Fearful that ''Konfrontasi'' would leave Java thinly covered by the army, and hand control to the 2 million-strong [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI), he authorised a Kostrad intelligence officer, [[Ali Murtopo]], to open secret contacts with the British and Malaysians.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n\n==Overthrow of Sukarno (1965)==\n{{Main|Transition to the New Order}}\n\n===Background===\n{{See also|Guided Democracy in Indonesia}}\n[[File:Sukarno, Sang Saka Melanglang Djagad, p12.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Sukarno]]]]\n\nTensions between the military and communists increased in April 1965, when Sukarno endorsed the immediate implementation of the PKI's proposal for a \"fifth armed force\" consisting of armed peasants and workers. However, this idea was rejected by the army's leadership as being tantamount to the PKI establishing its own armed forces. In May, the \"[[Gilchrist Document]]\" aroused Sukarno's fear of a military plot to overthrow him, a fear which he repeatedly mentioned during the next few months. On his independence day speech in August, Sukarno declared his intention to commit Indonesia to an anti-imperialist alliance with China and other communist regimes and warned the army not to interfere.<ref>Dake, Antonie (2006). Sukarno Files. Yayasan Obor</ref>\n\nWhile Sukarno devoted his energy for domestic and international politics, the economy of Indonesia deteriorated rapidly with worsening widespread poverty and hunger, while foreign debt obligations became unmanageable and infrastructure crumbled.  Sukarno's Guided Democracy stood on fragile grounds due to the inherent conflict between its two underlying support pillars, the military and the communists. The military, nationalists, and the Islamic groups were shocked by the rapid growth of the communist party under Sukarno's protection. They feared the imminent establishment of a communist state in Indonesia. By 1965, the PKI had three million members and was particularly strong in Central Java and Bali. The party had become the most potent political party in Indonesia.\n\n===Abortive coup and anti-communist purge===\n{{Main|30 September Movement|Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u20131966}}\n\n[[File:Suharto at funeral.jpg|thumb|As Major General, Suharto (''at right, foreground'') attends funeral for assassinated generals, 5 October 1965.]]\n\nBefore dawn on 1 October 1965, six army generals were kidnapped and executed in Jakarta by soldiers from the Presidential Guard, Diponegoro Division, and Brawidjaja Division.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 281</ref> Soldiers occupied Merdeka Square including the areas in front of the Presidential Palace, the national radio station, and telecommunications centre.

It was here that he was visited by Colonel Abdul Latief, a key member of [[30 September Movement]] and close family friend of Suharto. According to Latief's later testimony, the conspirators assumed Suharto to be a Sukarno-loyalist; hence Latief went to inform him of the impending kidnapping plan to save Sukarno from treacherous generals, upon which Suharto seemed to offer his neutrality.<ref name=\"Friend-2003_p104\">Friend (2003), page 104</ref>\n\nUpon being told of the killings, Suharto went to KOSTRAD headquarters just before dawn from where he could see soldiers occupying Merdeka Square. He mobilised [[KOSTRAD]] and RPKAD (now [[Kopassus]]) special forces to seize control of the centre of Jakarta, capturing key strategic sites including the radio station without resistance. Suharto announced over the radio at 9:00&nbsp;pm that six generals had been kidnapped by \"counter-revolutionaries\" and that the 30 September Movement actually intended to overthrow Sukarno. He said he was in control of the army, and that he would crush the 30 September Movement and safeguard Sukarno.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), p. 282.</ref> Suharto issued an ultimatum to [[Halim Perdanakusuma Airport|Halim Air Force Base]], where the G30S had based themselves and where Sukarno, air force commander [[Omar Dhani]] and PKI chairman [[Dipa Nusantara Aidit]] had gathered, causing them to disperse before Suhartoist soldiers occupied the airbase on 2 October after short fighting.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 281\u2013282</ref> With the failure of the poorly organised coup,<ref name=\"Ricklefs-1991_p281-282\">Ricklefs (1991), pages 281\u2013282</ref> and having secured authority from the president to restore order and security, Suharto's faction was firmly in control of the army by 2 October (he was officially appointed army commander on 14 October). On 5 October, Suharto led a dramatic public ceremony to bury the generals' bodies.\n\nComplicated and partisan theories continue to this day over the identity of the attempted coup's organisers and their aims. The army's version, and subsequently that of the [[Orde Baru|\"New Order\"]], was that the PKI was solely responsible.

For eighteen months following the quashing of the 30 September Movement, there was a complicated process of political manoeuvres against Sukarno, including student agitation, stacking of parliament, media propaganda and military threats.<ref name=\"Vickers 2005, page 160\">Vickers (2005), page 160</ref>\n\nIn January 1966, university students under the banner of [[KAMI (Indonesia)|KAMI]], begin demonstrations against the Sukarno government voicing demands for the disbandment of PKI and control of hyperinflation. The students received support and protection from the army. Street fights broke out between the students and pro-Sukarno loyalists with the pro-Suharto students prevailing due to army protection.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), pages 288 - 290</ref>\n\nIn February 1966, Sukarno promoted Suharto to lieutenant-general (and to full general in July 1966).<ref name=\"Elson 2001 pages = 130\u2013135\">{{harvnb|Elson|2001| pages = 130\u2013135 }}</ref> The killing of a student demonstrator and Sukarno's order for the disbandment of [[KAMI (Indonesia)|KAMI]] in February 1966 further galvanised public opinion against the president. On 11 March 1966, the appearance of unidentified troops around [[Merdeka Palace]] during a cabinet meeting (which Suharto had not attended) forced Sukarno to flee to [[Bogor Palace]] (60&nbsp;km away) by helicopter. Three pro-Suharto generals, Major-General [[Basuki Rahmat]], Brigadier-General [[M Jusuf]], and Brigadier-General [[Amirmachmud]] went to Bogor to meet Sukarno. There, they persuaded and secured a presidential decree from Sukarno (see ''[[Supersemar]]'') that gave Suharto authority to take any action necessary to maintain security.<ref name=\"Vickers 2005, page 160\" />\n\nUsing the ''Supersemar'' letter, Suharto ordered the banning of PKI the following day and proceeded to purge pro-Sukarno elements from the parliament, the government and military, accusing them of being communist sympathisers. The army arrested 15 cabinet ministers and forced Sukarno to appoint [[Second Revised Dwikora Cabinet|a new cabinet]] consisting of Suharto supporters. The army arrested pro-Sukarno and pro-communist members of the [[Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat|MPRS]] (parliament), and Suharto replaced chiefs of the navy, air force, and the police force with his supporters, who then began an extensive purge within each service.<ref name=\"Elson 2001 pages = 130\u2013135\"/>\n\nIn June 1966, the now-purged parliament passed 24 resolutions including the banning of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], ratifying the [[Supersemar]], and stripping Sukarno of his title of President for Life. Against the wishes of Sukarno, the government ended the Konfrontasi with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations<ref name=\"Hughes 2002, pages 267-270\" >{{harvnb|Hughes|2002| pages = 267\u2013270 }}</ref> (Sukarno had removed Indonesia from the UN in the previous year).<ref name=\"Hughes 2002, page 107\" >{{harvnb|Hughes|2002| page = 107 }}</ref> Suharto did not seek Sukarno's outright removal at this MPRS session due to the remaining support for the president among some elements of the armed forces.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p.25</ref>\n\nBy January 1967, Suharto felt confident that he had removed all significant support for Sukarno within the armed forces, and the MPRS decided to hold another session to impeach Sukarno. On 22 February 1967, Sukarno announced he would resign from the presidency, and on 12 March, the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power and named Suharto [[Acting presidency of Suharto|acting president]].<ref>{{cite book | last =McDonald | first =Hamish | title =Suharto's Indonesia | publisher =Fontana Books | year =1980 | pages =60 | url = | isbn =0-00-635721-0}}</ref> Sukarno was placed under house arrest in [[Bogor Palace]]; little more was heard from him, and he died on June 1970.<ref name=\"Schwartz 1994, page 2\">Schwartz (1994), page 2</ref> On 27 March 1968, the MPRS appointed Suharto for the first of his five-year terms as president.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), p. 295.</ref>\n\n==The \"New Order\" (1967\u20131998)==\n{{See also|New Order (Indonesia)}}\n\n===Ideology===\nSuharto promoted his \"New Order\", as opposed to Sukarno's \"Old Order\", as a society based on the [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] ideology. After initially being careful not to offend sensitivities of Islamic scholars who feared Pancasila might develop into a quasi-religious cult, Suharto secured a parliamentary resolution in 1983 which obliged all organisations in Indonesia to adhere to Pancasila as a fundamental principle. He also instituted mandatory Pancasila training programs for all Indonesians, from primary school students to office workers. In practice, however, the vagueness of Pancasila was exploited by Suharto's government to justify their actions and to condemn their opponents as \"anti-Pancasila\".<ref name=\"epress.anu.edu.au\">{{cite web |author=Ken Ward |url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Soeharto%E2%80%99s+New+Order+and+its+Legacy%3A+Essays+in+honour+of+Harold+Crouch/5331/ch02.xhtml#toc-anchor |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514025044/http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Soeharto%E2%80%99s+New+Order+and+its+Legacy%3A+Essays+in+honour+of+Harold+Crouch/5331/ch02.xhtml#toc-anchor |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-05-14 |title='2 Soeharto's Javanese Pancasila' in Soeharto's New Order and its Legacy: Essays in honour of Harold Crouch by Edited by Edward Aspinall and Greg Fealy &#124; ANU E Press |publisher=Epress.anu.edu.au |quote=([[Harold Crouch]]) |access-date=2013-12-06 }}</ref>\n\nThe New Order also implemented the ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' (\"Dual Function\") policy which enabled the military to have an active role in all levels of the Indonesian government, economy, and society.\n\n===Consolidation of power===\n{{See also|Acting presidency of Suharto}}\n\n[[File:Jenderal TNI Soeharto.png|thumb|upright|Official portrait during Suharto's acting presidency]]\n[[File:Suhartoappointedpresident.jpg|thumb|Suharto taking the presidential oath of office, 27 March 1968]]\n\nHaving been appointed president, Suharto still needed to share power with various elements including Indonesian generals who considered Suharto as mere ''[[primus inter pares]]'', and Islamic and student groups who participated in the anti-Communist purge. Suharto, aided by his \"Office of Personal Assistants\" (''[[Aspri]]'') clique of military officers from his days as commander of Diponegoro Division, particularly [[Ali Murtopo]], began to systematically cement his hold on power by subtly sidelining potential rivals while rewarding loyalists with political position and monetary incentives.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nHaving successfully stood-down MPRS chairman General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Nasution]]'s 1968 attempt to introduce a bill which would have severely curtailed presidential authority, Suharto had him removed from his position as MPRS chairman in 1969 and forced his early retirement from the military in 1972. In 1967, generals [[Hartono Rekso Dharsono]], [[Kemal Idris]], and [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] (dubbed \"New Order Radicals\") opposed Suharto's decision to allow participation of existing political parties in elections in favour of a non-ideological two-party system similar to those found in many Western countries. Suharto sent Dharsono overseas as an ambassador, while Idris and Wibowo were sent to distant [[North Sumatra]] and [[South Sulawesi]] as regional commanders.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, p. 56-59</ref>\n\nSuharto's previously strong relationship with the student movement soured over the increasing authoritarianism and corruption of his regime. While many original leaders of the 1966 student movement (''Angkatan '66'') were successfully co-opted into the regime, Suharto was faced with large student demonstrations challenging the legitimacy of 1971 elections (\"''Golput''\" movement), the costly construction of the [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]] theme park (1972), the domination of foreign capitalists ([[Malari Incident]] of 1974), and the lack of term limits of Suharto's presidency (1978). The regime responded by imprisoning many student activists (such as future national figures [[Dorodjatun Kuntjoro-Jakti]], [[Adnan Buyung Nasution]], Hariman Siregar, and [[Syahrir]]), and even sending  troops to occupy the campus of ITB ([[Bandung Institute of Technology]]) from January\u2013March 1978. In April 1978, Suharto moved decisively by issuing a decree on \"Normalisation of Campus Life\" (NKK) which prohibited political activities on-campus not related to academic pursuits.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, pp. 60\u201368</ref><ref>Aspinal (1999), p.ii</ref>\n\nOn 15\u201316 January 1974, Suharto faced a significant challenge when violent riots broke out in [[Jakarta]] during a visit by the Japanese prime minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]]. Students demonstrating against increasing dominance of Japanese investors were encouraged by General [[Sumitro]], deputy commander of the armed forces. Sumitro was an ambitious general who disliked the strong influence of Suharto's Aspri inner circle. Suharto learned that the riots were engineered by Sumitro to destabilise the regime, resulting in Sumitro's dismissal and forced retirement. This incident is referred to as the [[Malari incident|Malari Incident (''Malapetaka Lima Belas Januari'' / Disaster of 15 January)]]. However, Suharto also disbanded Aspri to appease popular dissent.<ref>[http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0904/18/0802.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507025707/http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/cetak/0904/18/0802.htm|date=7 May 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, fifty prominent political figures signed the [[Petition of Fifty]], which criticised Suharto's use of Pancasila to silence his critics. Suharto refused to address the petitioners' concerns, and some of them were imprisoned with others having restrictions imposed on their movements.<ref>Wanandi, 2012, pp. 86\u201388</ref>\n\n===Domestic politics and security===\n[[File:President Suharto, 1973 (full).jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto's official photo for his second term]]\n{{see also|Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Papua conflict}}\nTo placate demands from civilian politicians for the holding of elections, as manifested in MPRS resolutions of 1966 and 1967, Suharto government formulated a series of laws regarding elections as well as the structure and duties of parliament which were passed by MPRS in November 1969 after protracted negotiations. The law provided for a [[People's Consultative Assembly|parliament (''Madjelis Permusjawaratan Rakjat''/MPR)]] with the power to elect presidents, consisting of a lower house ([[People's Representative Council|''Dewan Perwakilan Rakjat''/DPR]]) and regional representatives. 100 of the 460 members of DPR will be directly appointed by the government, while the remaining seats were allocated to political parties based on results of a general election. This mechanism ensures significant government control over legislative affairs, particularly the appointment of presidents.<ref>Ricklefs (1982), p.76\u201377</ref><ref>Elson (2001), p.184\u2013186</ref>\n\nTo participate in the elections, Suharto realised the need to align himself with a political party. After initially considering alignment with Sukarno's old party the [[Indonesian National Party|PNI]], in 1969 Suharto decided to take over control of an obscure military-run federation of NGOs called [[Golkar]] (\"Functional Groups\") and transform it into his electoral vehicle under the coordination of his right-hand man [[Ali Murtopo]]. The [[1971 Indonesian legislative election|first general election]] was held on 3 July 1971 with ten participants; consisting of [[Golkar]], four Islamic parties, as well as five nationalist and Christian parties. Campaigning on a non-ideological platform of \"development\", and aided by official government support and subtle intimidation tactics, [[Golkar]] managed to secure 62.8% of the popular vote. The March 1973 general session of newly elected MPR promptly appointed Suharto to second-term in office with Sultan [[Hamengkubuwono IX]] as vice-president.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p. 32</ref>\n{{Quote|text=\"It is not the military strength of the Communists but their fanaticism and ideology which is the principal element of their strength.

The government ensured that these parties never developed effective opposition by controlling their leadership while establishing the \"re-call\" system to remove any outspoken legislators from their positions. Using this system dubbed the \"[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] Democracy\", Suharto was re-elected unopposed by the MPR in 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1998.<ref>Schwarz (1992), p.32</ref> Golkar won landslide majorities in the MPR at every election, ensuring that Suharto would be able to pass his agenda with virtually no opposition. Ultimately, he held all governing power in the country.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nSuharto proceeded with various social engineering projects designed to transform Indonesian society into a de-politicised \"floating mass\" supportive of the national mission of \"development\", a concept similar to [[corporatism]]. The government formed various civil society groups to unite the populace in support of government programs. For instance, the government created the [[Indonesian National Civil Service Corps]] (''Korps Pegawai Republik Indonesia'' or ''Korpri'') in November 1971 as union of civil servants to ensure their loyalty, organised the FBSI (''Federasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia'') as the only legal labour union in February 1973, and established the [[Indonesian Ulema Council|MUI]] in 1975 to control Islamic clerics. In 1966 to 1967, to promote [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the influential [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese-Indonesians]], the Suharto government passed [[Legislation on Chinese Indonesians|several laws]] as part of so-called \"Basic Policy for the Solution of Chinese Problem\", whereby only one Chinese-language publication (controlled by the Army) was allowed to continue, all Chinese cultural and religious expressions (including display of Chinese characters) were [[Sinophobia|prohibited]] from public space, Chinese schools were phased-out, and the ethnic-Chinese were forced to take-up [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Indonesian-sounding names]]; creating a systematic [[cultural genocide]]. In 1968, Suharto commenced the highly successful family-planning program (''Keluarga Berentjana / KB'') to stem the high population growth rate and hence increasing per-capita income. A lasting legacy from this period is the spelling reform of Indonesian language decreed by Suharto on 17 August 1972.<ref>Schwartz (1994), page 106</ref>\n\n[[File:Re-enactment Santa Cruz massacre.jpg|thumb|right|A re-enactment of the [[Santa Cruz massacre]] of at least 250 [[East Timor]]ese pro-independence demonstrators during the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]].]] \nSuharto relied on the military to ruthlessly maintain domestic security, organised by the [[Kopkamtib]] (Operation Command for the Restoration of Security and Order) and BAKIN (State Intelligence Coordination Agency). To maintain strict control over the country, Suharto expanded the army's territorial system down to village-level, while military officers were appointed as regional heads under the rubric of the ''[[Dwifungsi]]'' (\"Dual Function\") of the military. By 1969, 70% of Indonesia's provincial governors and more than half of its district chiefs were active military officers. Suharto authorised ''Operasi Trisula'' which destroyed PKI-remnants trying to organise a guerrilla base in [[Blitar]] area in 1968 and ordered several military operations that ended the communist PGRS-Paraku insurgency in [[West Kalimantan]] (1967\u20131972). Attacks on oil workers by the first incarnation of [[Free Aceh Movement]] separatists under [[Hasan di Tiro]] in 1977 led to the dispatch of small special forces detachments who quickly either killed or forced the movement's members to flee abroad.<ref>Conboy (2003), p. 262\u2013265</ref> Notably, on March 1981, Suharto authorised a successful special forces mission to end [[Garuda Indonesia Flight 206|hijacking of a Garuda Indonesia flight]] by Islamic extremists at [[Don Muang Airport]] in [[Bangkok]].<ref>Elson (2001), p. 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nTo comply with [[New York Agreement]] of 1962 which required a plebiscite on the integration of [[West Irian]] into Indonesia before the end of 1969, the Suharto government begin organising for a so-called \"[[Act of Free Choice]]\" scheduled for July\u2013August 1969. The government sent RPKAD special forces under [[Sarwo Edhie Wibowo]] which secured the surrender of several bands of former Dutch-organised militia (''[[Papuan Volunteer Corps|Papoea Vrijwilligers Korps / PVK]]'') at large in the jungles since the Indonesian takeover in 1963 while sending Catholic volunteers under [[Jusuf Wanandi]] to distribute consumer goods to promote pro-Indonesian sentiments. In March 1969, it was agreed that the plebiscite would be channelled via 1,025 tribal chiefs, citing the logistical challenge and political ignorance of the population. Using the above strategy, the plebiscite produced a unanimous decision for integration with Indonesia, which was duly noted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in November 1969.<ref>Elson (2001), p. 178\u2013279</ref>\n\n===Economy===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F032437-0030, Berchtesgaden, Staatsbesuch Pr\u00e4sident Suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto on a visit to [[West Germany]] in 1970.]]\n[[File:Suharto 1978.jpg|thumb|Suharto's official portrait for his third term (1978\u20131983)]]\n\nTo stabilise the economy and to ensure long-term support for the New Order, Suharto's administration enlisted a group of mostly US-educated Indonesian economists, dubbed the \"[[Berkeley Mafia]]\", to formulate significant changes in economic policy. By cutting subsidies, decreasing government debt, and reforming the exchange rate mechanism, inflation was lowered from 660% in 1966 to 19% in 1969. The threat of famine was alleviated by the influx of [[USAID]] rice aid shipments from 1967 to 1968.<ref>J. Panglaykim and K.D. Thomas, \"The New Order and the Economy,\" Indonesia, April 1967, p. 73.</ref>\n\nWith a lack of domestic capital that was required for economic growth, the New Order reversed Sukarno's economic self-sufficiency policies and opened selected economic sectors of the country to foreign investment through the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. Suharto travelled to Western Europe and Japan to promote investment in Indonesia. The first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia included mining companies [[Freeport-McMoran|Freeport Sulphur Company]] / [[International Nickel Company]]. Following government regulatory frameworks, domestic entrepreneurs (mostly Chinese-Indonesians) emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the import-substitution light-manufacturing sector such as [[Astra Group]] and [[Salim Group]].<ref name=\"Robinson 2012, p. 178-203\">Robinson (2012), p. 178\u2013203</ref>\n\nFrom 1967, the government secured low-interest foreign aid from ten countries grouped under the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) to cover its budget deficit.<ref>Elson (2001), p. 170\u2013172</ref> With the IGGI funds and the later jump in oil export revenue from the [[1973 oil crisis]], the government invested in infrastructure under a series of five-year plans, dubbed REPELITA (''Rencana Pembangunan Lima Tahun'') I to VI from 1969 to 1998.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /><ref name=\"Robinson 2012, p. 178-203\"/><ref name=\"Sheridan-theaustralian\">\n{{cite news| last = Sheridan| first = Greg| title = Farewell to Jakarta's Man of Steel|work=The Australian| date = 28 January 2008| url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/farewell-to-jakartas-man-of-steel/story-e6frg6v6-1111115412423| accessdate =14 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nOutside the formal economy, Suharto created a network of charitable organisations (\"''yayasan''\") run by the military and his family members, which extracted \"donations\" from domestic and foreign enterprises in exchange for necessary government support and permits.

Western countries, impressed by Suharto's strong anti-communist credentials, were quick to offer their support. [[China-Indonesia relations|Diplomatic relations]] with China were suspended in October 1967 due to suspicion of Chinese involvement in the [[30 September Movement]] (diplomatic relations was only restored in 1990). Due to Suharto's destruction of PKI, the [[Soviet Union]] embargoed military sales to Indonesia. However, from 1967 to 1970 foreign minister [[Adam Malik]] managed to secure several agreements to restructure massive debts incurred by Sukarno from the Soviet Union and other Eastern European communist states. Regionally, having ended confrontation with [[Malaysia]] in August 1966, Indonesia became a founding member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in August 1967. This organisation is designed to establish a peaceful relationship between Southeast Asian countries free from conflicts such as the ongoing [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" />\n\nIn 1974, the neighbouring colony of [[Portuguese Timor]] descended into civil war after the withdrawal of Portuguese authority following the [[Carnation Revolution]], whereby the left-wing populist [[Fretilin]] (''Frente Revolucion\u00e1ria de Timor-Leste Independente'') emerged triumphant. With approval from Western countries (including from US president [[Gerald Ford]] and Australian prime minister [[Gough Whitlam]] during their visits to Indonesia), Suharto decided to intervene claiming to prevent the establishment of a communist state. After an unsuccessful attempt of covert support to Timorese groups [[Timorese Democratic Union|UDT]] and [[APODETI]], Suharto authorised a full-scale [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] of the colony on 7 December 1975 followed with its official annexation as Indonesia's 27th province of [[East Timor]] in July 1976. The \"encirclement and annihilation\" campaigns of 1977\u20131979 broke the back of Fretilin control over the hinterlands, although continuing guerrilla resistance caused the government to maintain a strong military force in the half-island until 1999. An estimated minimum of 90,800 and maximum of 213,600 conflict-related deaths occurred in East Timor during [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian rule (1974\u20131999)]]; namely, 17,600\u201319,600 killings and 73,200 to 194,000 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness, although Indonesian forces were responsible for about 70% of the violent killings.<ref>{{cite web |author=Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group |title=The Profile of Human Rights Violations in Timor-Leste, 1974\u20131999 |work=A Report to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste |publisher=Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) |date=9 February 2006 |url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65eZ8hHJe?url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |archive-date=22 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Indonesia's [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion]] and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]] of [[East Timor]] during Suharto's presidency resulted in at least 100,000 deaths.<ref>[[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor]] {{cite web |author=Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group |title=The Profile of Human Rights Violations in Timor-Leste, 1974\u20131999 |work=A Report to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste |publisher=Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) |date=9 February 2006 |url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65eZ8hHJe?url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |archive-date=22 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Socio-economic progress and growing corruption===\n[[File:President Suharto, 1983.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Suharto's official portrait for his fourth term (1983\u20131988). Early into this term, Suharto was bestowed the title \"Father of Development\" by the [[People's Consultative Assembly|Parliament]] due to his \"development projects\".]]\nReal socio-economic progress sustained support for Suharto's regime across three decades. By 1996, Indonesia's poverty rate has dropped to around 11% compared with 45% in 1970. From 1966 to 1997, Indonesia recorded real GDP growth of 5.03% pa, pushing real GDP per capita upwards from US$806 to US$4,114. In 1966, the manufacturing sector made up less than 10% of GDP (mostly industries related to oil and agriculture). By 1997, manufacturing had risen to 25% of GDP, and 53% of exports consisted of manufactured products. The government invested in massive infrastructure development (notably the launching of a series of [[Palapa]] telecommunication satellites); consequently, Indonesian infrastructure in the mid-1990s was considered at par with China. Suharto was keen to capitalise on such achievements to justify his regime, and an [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] resolution in 1983 granted him the title of \"Father of Development\".<ref>Rock (2003), p.3</ref>\n\nSuharto government's health-care programs (such as the ''Puskesmas'' program) increased life expectancy from 47 years (1966) to 67 years (1997) while cutting infant mortality rate by more than 60%. The government's ''Inpres'' program launched in 1973 resulted in primary school enrolment ratio reaching 90% by 1983 while almost eliminating the education gap between boys and girls. Sustained support for agriculture resulted in Indonesia achieving rice self-sufficiency by 1984, an unprecedented achievement which earned Suharto a gold medal from the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] in November 1985.<ref>Rock (2003), p.4</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Suharto government responded to the fall in oil exports due to the [[1980s oil glut]] by successfully shifting the basis of the economy to export-oriented labour-intensive manufacturing, made globally competitive by Indonesia's low wages and a series of currency devaluations. Industrialisation was mostly undertaken by [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese-Indonesian]] companies which evolved into large conglomerates dominating the nation's economy. The largest of these conglomerates were the [[Salim Group]] led by [[Liem Sioe Liong|Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim)]], [[Sinar Mas Group]] led by [[Eka Tjipta Widjaja|Oei Ek Tjong (Eka Tjipta Widjaja)]], [[Astra Group]] led by [[William Soeryadjaya|Tjia Han Poen (William Soeryadjaya)]], [[Lippo Group]] led by [[Mochtar Riady|Lie Mo Tie (Mochtar Riady)]], Barito Pacific Group led by [[Prajogo Pangestu|Pang Djun Phen (Prajogo Pangestu)]], and Nusamba Group led by [[Bob Hasan]]. Suharto decided to support the growth of a small number of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates since they would not pose a political challenge due to their ethnic-minority status, but from his experience, he deemed them to possess the skills and capital needed to create real growth for the country. In exchange for Suharto's patronage, the conglomerates provided vital financing for his \"regime maintenance\" activities.<ref name=\"Deepblue.lib.umich.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/40018/wp632.pdf?sequence=3|title=The Politics of Development Policy and Development Policy Reform in New Order Indonesia |publisher=Deepblue.lib.umich.edu|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Suharto government decided to de-regulate the banking sector to encourage savings and providing a domestic source of financing required for growth. Suharto decreed the \"October Package of 1988\" (''PAKTO 88'') which eased requirements for establishing banks and extending credit; resulting in a 50% increase in the number of banks from 1989 to 1991. To promote savings, the government introduced the ''TABANAS'' program to the populace. The [[Jakarta Stock Exchange]], re-opened in 1977, recorded a \"bull run\", due to a spree of domestic [[Initial Public Offering|IPOs]] and an influx of foreign funds after the deregulation in 1990. The sudden availability of credit fuelled robust economic growth in the early 1990s, but the weak regulatory environment of the financial sector sowed the seeds of the catastrophic crisis in 1997, which eventually destroyed Suharto's regime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bi.go.id/NR/rdonlyres/A6011CBA-1B4E-49B1-9DDC-CB01AB6C60D0/19386/SejarahPerbankanPeriode19831997.pdf|title=Bank Indonesia|publisher=Bi.go.id|accessdate=28 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe growth of the economy coincided with the rapid expansion of corruption, collusion, and nepotism (''Korupsi, Kolusi, dan Nepotisme / KKN''). In the early 1980s, Suharto's children, particularly [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana]] (\"Tutut\"), [[Tommy Suharto|Hutomo Mandala Putra (\"Tommy\")]], and Bambang Trihatmodjo, had grown into greedy adults. Their companies were given lucrative government contracts and protected from market competition by monopolies. Examples include the [[List of toll roads in Indonesia|toll-expressway]] market which was monopolised by Tutut, the national car project monopolised by Bambang and Tommy, and even the cinema market, monopolised by [[21 Cineplex]] (owned by Suharto's cousin Sudwikatmono). The family is said to control about 36,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of real estate in Indonesia, including 100,000&nbsp;m\u00b2 of prime office space in Jakarta and nearly 40% of the land in East Timor. Additionally, Suharto's family members received free shares in 1,251 of Indonesia's most lucrative domestic companies (mostly run by Suharto's ethnic-Chinese cronies), while foreign-owned companies were encouraged to establish \"strategic partnerships\" with Suharto family companies. Meanwhile, the myriad of ''yayasan''s run by the Suharto family grew even larger, levying millions of dollars in \"donations\" from the public and private sectors each year.<ref name=\"BBC_20040325\"/><ref name=\"Global Corruption Report\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4459/26786/file/Introduction_to_political_corruption.pdf |title=Global Corruption Report|publisher=Transparency International |accessdate=6 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2004, the German anti-corruption NGO Transparency International released a list of what it believed to be the ten most self-enriching leaders in the previous two decades; in order of amount allegedly stolen in USD, the highest-ranking of these was Suharto and his family who are alleged to have embezzled $15 billion \u2013 $35 billion.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.transparency.org/content/download/4450/26759/file/GCR_2004_press_release_FINAL.pdf|title=Plundering politicians and bribing multinationals undermine economic development, says TI|publisher=Transparency International|date=25 March 2004|accessdate=21 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The New Order in the 1980s and 1990s===\n[[File:President Suharto, 1988.jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto's official portrait for his fifth term (1988\u20131993)]]\n[[File:William cohen with suharto.jpg|thumb|Suharto with [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]], 14 January 1998.]]\nBy the 1980s, Suharto's grip on power was maintained by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, and use of the military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General [[Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani]] as head of the armed forces who adopted a hard-line approach on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.<ref>Elson (2001), p.457-460</ref>\n\nFrom 1983 to 1985, army squads killed up to 10,000 suspected criminals in response to a spike in the crime rate (see \"[[Petrus Killings]]\"). Suharto's imposition of Pancasila as the sole ideology caused protests from conservative Islamic groups who considered Islamic law to be above all other conceptions. The [[Tanjung Priok massacre]] saw the army kill up to 100 conservative Muslim protesters in September 1984. A retaliatory series of small bombings, including the bombing of [[Borobudur]], led to arrests of hundreds of conservative Islamic activists, including future parliamentary leader AM Fatwa and [[Abu Bakar Bashir]] (later leader of [[Jemaah Islamiyah]]). Attacks on police by a resurgent [[Free Aceh Movement]] in 1989 led to a military operation which killed 2,000 people and ended the insurgency by 1992. In 1984, the Suharto government sought increased control over the press by issuing a law requiring all media to possess a press operating  license (''SIUPP'') which could be revoked at any time by Ministry of Information.<ref>Aspinal (1999), pp. ii\u2013iii</ref>\n\nWestern concern over communism waned with the end of the [[Cold War]], and Suharto's human rights record came under greater international scrutiny, particularly following the 1991 [[Santa Cruz Massacre]] in East Timor. Suharto was elected as head of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in 1992, while Indonesia became a founding member of [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] in 1989 and host to the [[Bogor]] APEC Summit in 1994.<ref>Elson (2001), p.510\u2013511</ref>\n\nDomestically, the business dealings of Suharto's family created discontent amongst the military who lost access to power and lucrative rent-seeking opportunities. The March 1988 [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] session, military legislators attempted to pressure Suharto by unsuccessfully seeking to block the nomination of [[Sudharmono]], a Suharto-loyalist, as vice-president. Moerdani's criticism of the Suharto family's corruption saw the president dismiss him from the position of military chief. Suharto proceeded to slowly \"de-militarise\" his regime; he dissolved the powerful [[Kopkamtib]] in September 1988 and ensured key military positions were held by loyalists.<ref>Pour (2007), p.242\u2013264</ref>\n\n[[File:Suharto and wife after hajj.jpg|256px|left|thumb|Suharto and his wife in Islamic attire after performing hajj in 1991]]\nIn an attempt to diversify his power base away from the military, Suharto began courting support from Islamic elements. He undertook a much-publicised [[hajj]] pilgrimage in 1991, took up the name of Haji Mohammad Suharto, and promoted Islamic values and the careers of Islamic-oriented generals. To win support from the nascent Muslim business community who resented the dominance of Chinese-Indonesian conglomerates, Suharto formed the ICMI (Indonesian Islamic Intellectuals' Association) in November 1990, which was led by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[BJ Habibie]], the Minister for Research and Technology since 1978. During this period, race riots against ethnic-Chinese begin to occur quite regularly, beginning with April 1994 riot in [[Medan]].<ref name=\"Elson 2001, p.211-214\">Elson (2001), p.211-214</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s, Suharto's government came to be dominated by civilian politicians such as [[B. J. Habibie|Habibie]], [[Harmoko]], [[Ginandjar Kartasasmita]], and [[Akbar Tanjung]], who owed their position solely to Suharto. As a sign of Habibie's growing clout, when two prominent Indonesian magazines and a tabloid newspaper reported on criticism over Habibie's purchase of almost the entire fleet of the disbanded [[East German Navy]] in 1993 (most of the vessels were of scrap-value), the Ministry of Information ordered the offending publications be closed down on 21 June 1994.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Steele|first1=Janet|title=Wars Within: The Story of Tempo, an Independent Magazine in Soeharto's Indonesia|date=2005|publisher=Equinox Publishing|isbn=9793780088|pages=234\u2013235 |edition=First}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Suharto with military uniform, 1997.jpg|thumb|upright|Suharto with five-star rank on his shoulders]]\nIn the 1990s, elements within the growing Indonesian middle class created by Suharto's economic development were becoming restless with his autocracy and the corruption of his children, fuelling demands for \"[[Post-Suharto era|Reformasi]]\" (reform) of the almost 30-year-old New Order government. By 1996, [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], the daughter of [[Sukarno]] and chairwoman of the normally compliant [[Indonesian Democratic Party|PDI]], was becoming a rallying point for this growing discontent. In response, Suharto backed a co-opted faction of PDI led by [[Suryadi (politician)|Suryadi]], which removed Megawati from the chair. On 27 July 1996, an attack by soldiers and hired thugs led by Lieutenant-General [[Sutiyoso]] on demonstrating Megawati supporters in Jakarta resulted in fatal riots and looting. This incident was followed by the arrest of 200 democracy activists, 23 of whom were kidnapped, and some killed, by army squads led by Suharto's son-in-law, Major-General [[Prabowo Subianto]].<ref>Elson (2001), p. 284-287</ref>\n\n===Economic crisis and resignation===\n{{Main|Fall of Suharto}}\n[[File:Suharto resigns.jpg|thumb|Suharto reads his resignation speech at Merdeka Palace on 21 May 1998.

From mid-1997 there were large capital outflows and against the US dollar. Due to poor bank lending practices, many Indonesian companies borrowed cheaper US dollar loans while their income is mainly in Indonesian rupiah. The weakening rupiah spurred panic buying of US dollar by these companies, causing the [[Indonesian rupiah]] to drop in value from a pre-crisis level of Rp. 2,600 to a low point in early 1998 of around Rp. 17,000. Consequently, many companies were bankrupted and the economy shrank by 13.7%, leading to sharp increases in unemployment and poverty across the country.<ref name=\"CountryBrief\">{{cite web |title=Indonesia: Country Brief |work=Indonesia:Key Development Data & Statistics |publisher=The World Bank |date=September 2006 |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/EASTASIAPACIFICEXT/INDONESIAEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20095968~pagePK:141137~piPK:141127~theSitePK:226309,00.html}}</ref> Efforts by the [[Bank Indonesia|central bank]] to defend the rupiah proved futile and only drained the country's dollar reserves. In exchange for US$43 billion in liquidity aid, between October 1997 and the following April, Suharto signed three letters of intent with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) for an economic reform process. In January 1998, the government was forced to provide emergency liquidity assistance (BLBI), issue blanket guarantees for bank deposits and set-up the [[Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency]] to take over management of troubled banks in order to prevent the collapse of the financial system. Among the steps taken on IMF recommendation, the government raised an interest rate up to 70% pa in February 1998, which further worsened the contraction of the economy.\n\nIn December 1997, Suharto did not attend an ASEAN presidents' summit for the first time, which was later revealed to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the immediate future of his presidency. In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to re-assert his authority and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing rupiah.<ref>Friend (2003), p. 313.</ref> However, his attempts to re-instil confidence had little effect. Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the most stringent requirements of the IMF reform process, further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership.<ref>Monash Asia Institute (1999), p. v.</ref>\n\n[[File:President Suharto, 1998.png|thumb|upright|Suharto's official portrait for his seventh term (1998)]]\nThe economic meltdown was accompanied by increasing political tension. Anti-Chinese riots occurred in [[Situbondo]] (1996), [[Tasikmalaya]] (1996), [[Banjarmasin]] (1997), and [[Makassar]] (1997); while violent ethnic clashes broke out between the [[Dayak people|Dayak]] and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] settlers in [[Central Kalimantan]] in 1997. [[Golkar]] won the rigged [[1997 Indonesian elections|1997 election]], and in March 1998, Suharto was voted unanimously to another five-year term. He nominated his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[B. J. Habibie]] as vice president then stacking the [[Seventh Development Cabinet|cabinet]] with his own family and business associates, including his eldest daughter [[Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana|Tutut]] as Minister of Social Affairs. The appointments and the government's unrealistic 1998 budget created further currency instability,<ref name=\"Friend 2003, p. 314\">Friend (2003), p. 314.</ref> rumours and panic led to a run on stores and pushed up prices.<ref>Friend (2003), p. 314; Monash Asia Institute (1999), p. v</ref> The government increased the fuel prices further by 70% in May 1998, which triggered another wave of riots in [[Medan]].<ref>Purdey (2006), p. 115</ref>\n\nWith Suharto increasingly seen as the source of the country's mounting economic and political crises, prominent political figures, including Muslim politician [[Amien Rais]], spoke out against his presidency, and in January 1998 university students began organising nationwide demonstrations.<ref>Elson (2001), p.267</ref> The crisis climaxed while Suharto was on a state visit to Egypt on 12 May 1998, when security forces [[Trisakti shootings|killed four demonstrators]] from Jakarta's [[Trisakti University]]. [[Indonesian riots of May 1998|Rioting and looting across Jakarta and other cities]] over the following days destroyed thousands of buildings and killed over 1,000 people. Ethnic Chinese and their businesses were particular targets in the violence. Theories on the origin of the violence include rivalry between military chief General [[Wiranto]] and [[Commander of Army Strategic Command (Indonesia)|Army Strategic Commander]] Lt. Gen. [[Prabowo Subianto]], and the suggestion of deliberate provocation by Suharto to divert blame for the crisis to the ethnic-Chinese and discredit the student movement.<ref>Purdey (2006), p.148-150</ref>\n\nOn 16 May, tens of thousands of university students demanded Suharto's resignation, occupied the grounds and roof of [[DPR/MPR Building|the parliament building]]. Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he offered to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet. These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet. According to Wiranto, on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him to take any measures to restore security; however, Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population.<ref>Wiranto (2003), p.67-69</ref> On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president Habibie assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution.<ref name=\"SMH_McDONALD\" /><ref name=\"Vickers 2005, pp. 203\u2013207\">Vickers (2005), pp. 203\u2013207.</ref><ref>E.

However, in September court-appointed doctors announced that he could not stand trial because of his declining health. State prosecutors tried again in 2002, but then doctors cited an unspecified brain disease.

Apart from performing in the UK, they occasionally played in [[Hamburg]] ([[Star-Club]], [[Top Ten Club]]) and in [[Cologne]] (Storyville). Ward-Davies had acquired his nickname when he unwrapped a chocolate bar before absent-mindedly discarding the bar and attempting to eat the wrapper.<ref name=Guardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/15/trevor-ward-davies-dozy|title=Trevor Ward-Davies obituary|author=Dave Laing|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nVocalist Dave Dee, the ex-policeman, was at the scene of the [[vehicle collision|motoring accident]] that took the life of the American [[rock and roll]]er [[Eddie Cochran]] and injured [[Gene Vincent]] in April 1960.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn summer 1964, the British [[songwriter]]s [[Ken Howard (composer)|Ken Howard]] and [[Alan Blaikley]] became interested in [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] them. The band was set up in the studio to make recordings with [[Joe Meek]]. These recording sessions failed to get off the ground. Dave Dee stated that Meek \"had very strange recording techniques. He wanted us to play the song at half speed and then he would speed it up and put all these little tricks on it. We said we couldn't do it that way. He exploded, threw coffee all over the studio and stormed up to his room. His assistant [Patrick Pink] came in and said, 'Mr Meek will not be doing any more recording today'. That was it.

To obtain a [[bouzouki]] sound on the recording, an electrified [[mandolin]] was used.  The song was inspired by music from the film sound track of  Zorba The Greek.

In New Zealand, the group had three number one hits, and 7 other songs reached the top 10. In Australia, they reached the top 10 with \"Hold Tight!\", \"Bend It!\", \"Zabadak!\" and \"The Legend of Xanadu\". In Canada, the band scored two top 10 hits with \"Zabadak!\", which reached #1, and \"The Legend of Xanadu\", and hit the top 30 with \"Break Out\"\u2014a song that didn't chart in any other country.\n\nIn the US, the group failed to break out nationally, although they had regional successes, particularly in northeastern cities such as [[Cleveland]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and [[Boston]] where both \"Bend It\" and \"Hold Tight\" gained considerable airplay and charted in the top 10 on local radio stations.  \"Zabadak\" gained extensive US airplay during winter 1967\u201368, climbing top 10 in several major US markets including [[Los Angeles]], but despite pockets of radio exposure, the band never gained mass airplay in America; \"Zabadak\" was the band's only single to chart in the national [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], where it peaked at No. 52. This is at least partially a result of both the band's US labels, Fontana and [[Imperial Records]], failing to secure them a US tour or TV appearances. Fontana set up just two appearances on national US TV programs. These were in July 1966 (\"Hold Tight\" on ''Where the Action Is'') and ''Piccadilly Palace'' on 26 August 1967 (performing their then-current single \"Okay\"). Imperial scored none.\n\nIn September 1969, Dave Dee left the group for a short-lived [[solo (music)|solo]] career.

Apart from performing in the UK, they also occasionally played in [[Hamburg]] ([[Star-Club]], [[Top Ten Club]]) and in [[Cologne]] (Storyville). Ward-Davies had acquired his nickname when he unwrapped a chocolate bar before absent-mindedly discarding the bar and attempting to eat the wrapper.<ref name=Guardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/15/trevor-ward-davies-dozy|title=Trevor Ward-Davies obituary|author=Dave Laing|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nVocalist Dave Dee, the ex-policeman, was at the scene of the [[vehicle collision|motoring accident]] that took the life of the American [[rock and roll]]er [[Eddie Cochran]] and injured [[Gene Vincent]] in April 1960.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nIn summer 1964, the British [[songwriter]]s [[Ken Howard (composer)|Ken Howard]] and [[Alan Blaikley]] became interested in [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] them. The band was set up in the studio to make recordings with [[Joe Meek]]. These recording sessions failed to get off the ground as an interview with Dave Dee stated that Meek \"had very strange recording techniques. He wanted us to play the song at half speed and then he would speed it up and put all these little tricks on it. We said we couldn't do it that way. He exploded, threw coffee all over the studio and stormed up to his room. His assistant [Patrick Pink] came in and said, 'Mr Meek will not be doing any more recording today'. That was it. We lugged all our gear out and went back home\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp2/artists/d/dee_dave/located/page2.shtml |title=Top of the Pops 2 \u2013 Where Are The Now? |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref> While these recording sessions proved unsuccessful they eventually gained a [[recording contract]] with [[Fontana Records]].\n\nKen Howard said that: \"We changed their name to Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich, because they were their actual nicknames and because we wanted to stress their very distinct personalities in a climate which regarded bands as collectives\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kenhoward-alanblaikley.com/biography/index.html |title=Ken Howard \u2013 Alan Blaikley \u2013 Biography |publisher=Kenhoward-alanblaikley.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}</ref> The distinctive name, coupled with well produced and catchy [[song]]s by Howard and Blaikley, quickly caught the UK public's imagination and their records started to sell in abundance.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> Indeed, between 1965 and 1969, the group spent more weeks in the [[UK Singles Chart]] than [[the Beatles]]{{cn|date=March 2018}} and made the odd tour 'down under' to Australia and New Zealand, where they had also experienced some marked chart success during this period.\n\nThey also scored a Number One [[hit record|hit]] in the UK Singles Chart in 1968 with \"[[The Legend of Xanadu]]\".<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David\n| last= Roberts\n| year= 2006\n| title= British Hit Singles & Albums\n| edition= 19th\n| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited\n| location= London\n| isbn= 1-904994-10-5\n| page= 146}}</ref> The combined sales figures were in excess of one million copies.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> Their other [[Top 40|top 10]] UK hits included \"Hideaway\", \"[[Hold Tight (Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich song)|Hold Tight!]]\", \"Bend It!\", \"Save Me!\", \"Touch Me, Touch Me\", \"Okay!\", \"[[Zabadak (song)|Zabadak!]]\" and \"Last Night in Soho\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n\n\"Bend It!\" was a big hit in Europe, including a Number One in [[West Germany|Germany]].

In Canada, the band scored two top 10 hits with \"Zabadak!\", which reached #1, and \"The Legend of Xanadu\", and hit the top 30 with \"Break Out\"\u2014a song that didn't chart in any other country.\n\nIn the US, the group failed to break out nationally, although they had regional successes, particularly in northeastern cities such as [[Cleveland]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and [[Boston]] where both \"Bend It\" and \"Hold Tight\" gained considerable airplay and charted in the top 10 on local radio stations.  \"Zabadak\" gained extensive US airplay during winter 1967\u201368, climbing top 10 in several major US markets including [[Los Angeles]], but despite pockets of radio exposure, the band never gained mass airplay in America; \"Zabadak\" was the band's only single to chart in the national [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], where it peaked at No. 52. This is at least partially a result of both the band's US labels, Fontana and [[Imperial Records]], failing to secure them a US tour or TV appearances. Fontana set up just two appearances on national US TV programs. These were in July 1966 (\"Hold Tight\" on ''Where the Action Is'') and ''Piccadilly Palace'' on 26 August 1967 (performing their then-current single \"Okay\"). Imperial scored none.\n\nIn September 1969, Dave Dee left the group for a short-lived [[solo (music)|solo]] career. ''NME'' reported the previous month that Dave Dee was to play a motorbike gang leader in the forthcoming [[Marty Feldman]] [[film]] ''[[Every Home Should Have One]]''.<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 2\">{{cite book\n| first= John\n| last= Tobler\n| year= 1992\n| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\n| edition= 1st\n| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/nmerocknrollyear0000unse/page/199 199]\n| id= CN 5585\n| isbn= 0-600-57602-7\n| url= https://archive.org/details/nmerocknrollyear0000unse/page/199\n}}</ref> The rest of the band, re-billed as (D,B,M and T), continued releasing records until they broke up in 1972.

Dave Dee was a [[Justice of the Peace|J.P.]] in [[Cheshire]] until he retired from the bench in 2008 due to his failing health.
