{"title_page": "European route E01 in Ireland", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=May 2019|bot=noref (GreenC bot)}}\nThe [[European route E01]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] is a serie of roads, part of the [[International E-road network]] running in a north south axis on the Irish east coast. It runs through five [[Counties of Ireland|counties]] starting on the [[United Kingdom|British]] border with the province of [[Northern Ireland]] at [[Dundalk]], coming from [[Belfast]] and [[Larne]]. It passes the capital [[Dublin]] until it stops at [[Rosslare Harbour]] in Southern [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. From there the E01 crosses the [[Celtic Sea]] and the [[Bay of Biscay]] on a non-existent [[ferry]] towards [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]].\n\n== Route ==\nThe [[European route E01|E01]] comes from [[Northern Ireland]] when it crosses the border at [[Dundalk]] where the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[A1 road (Northern Ireland)|A1 road]] changes to the [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] N1 road until northern [[Dundalk]]. It then follows the [[M1 motorway (Republic of Ireland)|M1 motorway]] to [[Drogheda]] and eventually the [[capital city|capital]] [[Dublin]]. After using the [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50]] ring road around [[Dublin]], the E01 uses the [[N11 road (Ireland)|N11 road]] and [[M11 motorway (Republic of Ireland)|M11 motorway]] passing [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]], [[Wicklow]], [[Gorey]] and [[Enniscorthy]] to [[Wexford]]. The last part is the [[N25 road (Ireland)|N25 road]] towards [[Rosslare Harbour]].

In 1928, the newspaper established an early example of an [[offshore radio]] station aboard a yacht, both as a means of self-promotion and as a way to break the BBC's monopoly. However, the project failed as the equipment was not able to provide a decent signal from overboard, and the transmitter was replaced by a set of speakers. The yacht spent the summer entertaining beach-goers with gramophone records interspersed with publicity for the newspaper and its insurance fund. The ''Mail'' was also a frequent sponsor on [[Border blaster|continental commercial radio stations targeted towards Britain]] throughout the 1920s and 1930s and periodically voiced support for the legalisation of private radio, something that would not happen until 1973.\n\nFrom 1923 Lord Rothermere and the ''Daily Mail'' formed an alliance with the other great press baron, [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]]. Their opponent was the Conservative Party politician and leader [[Stanley Baldwin]].

In early 1930 the two Lords launched the [[United Empire Party]] which the ''Daily Mail'' supported enthusiastically.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe rise of the new party dominated the newspaper and, even though Beaverbrook soon withdrew, Rothermere continued to campaign. Vice Admiral [[Ernest Augustus Taylor]] fought the first by-election for the [[United Empire Party]] in October, defeating the official Conservative candidate by 941 votes. Baldwin's position was now in doubt, but in 1931 [[Duff Cooper]] won the key [[1931 Westminster St George's by-election|by-election at St George's, Westminster]], beating the United Empire Party candidate, Sir [[Ernest Petter]], supported by Rothermere, and this broke the political power of the press barons.<ref name=\"Dennis2006\">{{cite book|title=Fleet Street|chapter=13.

The same production method was adopted in 1909 by the ''[[Daily Sketch]]'', in 1927 by the ''[[Daily Express]]'' and eventually by virtually all the other national newspapers. Printing of the ''Scottish Daily Mail'' was switched from Edinburgh to the Deansgate plant in Manchester in 1968 and, for a while, ''[[The People]]'' was also printed on the ''Mail'' presses in Deansgate. In 1987, printing at Deansgate ended and the northern editions were thereafter printed at other Associated Newspapers plants.\n\nIn 1906 the paper offered \u00a310,000 for the first flight from London to [[Manchester]], followed by a \u00a31,000 prize for the first flight across the [[English Channel]].

Fifteen hundred members of the [[London Stock Exchange]] burned unsold copies and called for a boycott of the Harmsworth Press. Prime Minister [[H. H.

In 1928, the newspaper established an early example of an [[offshore radio]] station aboard a yacht, both as a means of self-promotion and as a way to break the BBC's monopoly. However, the project failed as the equipment was not able to provide a decent signal from overboard, and the transmitter was replaced by a set of speakers. The yacht spent the summer entertaining beach-goers with gramophone records interspersed with publicity for the newspaper and its insurance fund. The ''Mail'' was also a frequent sponsor on [[Border blaster|continental commercial radio stations targeted towards Britain]] throughout the 1920s and 1930s and periodically voiced support for the legalisation of private radio, something that would not happen until 1973.\n\nFrom 1923 Lord Rothermere and the ''Daily Mail'' formed an alliance with the other great press baron, [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]]. Their opponent was the Conservative Party politician and leader [[Stanley Baldwin]].

In early 1930 the two Lords launched the [[United Empire Party]] which the ''Daily Mail'' supported enthusiastically.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThe rise of the new party dominated the newspaper and, even though Beaverbrook soon withdrew, Rothermere continued to campaign. Vice Admiral [[Ernest Augustus Taylor]] fought the first by-election for the [[United Empire Party]] in October, defeating the official Conservative candidate by 941 votes. Baldwin's position was now in doubt, but in 1931 [[Duff Cooper]] won the key [[1931 Westminster St George's by-election|by-election at St George's, Westminster]], beating the United Empire Party candidate, Sir [[Ernest Petter]], supported by Rothermere, and this broke the political power of the press barons.<ref name=\"Dennis2006\">{{cite book|title=Fleet Street|chapter=13.
