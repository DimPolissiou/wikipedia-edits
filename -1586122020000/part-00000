Semi-autonomous or fully autonomous ships can potentially reduce and eliminate these costs, creating an incentive for shipping companies who strive for cost reduction in an increasingly competitive market.

Ships can be constructed so that it will be difficult to board them, with cargo access and manual controls being made unavailable. In the case of a piracy event, control centers can immobilize the ship or having it sail a specific course until naval authorities can reach it. Without the presence of a crew to hold hostage and ransom, the cargo ships are argued to be less valuable target for pirates.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Levander |first1=Oskar |title=Autonomous ships on the high seas |journal= IEEE Spectrum |date=Feb 2017 |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=26\u201331 |doi= 10.1109/MSPEC.2017.7833502}}</ref>\n\n== Potential challenges ==\n\n=== Reliability ===\n\nCurrently most crews on board commercial cargo ships primarily consist of navigational officers and engine crews who maintain the ship's propulsion machinery, auxiliary machinery, generators for procuring electricity, separators, pumps, cooling system.

Increasing redundancy is seen as the solution, either by having two engine systems or by using different propulsion methods that contain fewer moving parts such as electricity on {{MV|Yara Birkeland}}.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blanke |first1=Mogens |last2=Henriques |first2=Michael |last3=Bang |first3=Jakob |title=A pre-analysis on autonomous ships |journal=Danish Technical University |url=https://www.dma.dk/Documents/Publikationer/Autonome%20skibe_DTU_rapport_UK.pdf |accessdate=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Regulation ===\n\nInternational regulation is seen as one of the biggest challenges facing autonomous ships. Rule 5 in the [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]] (COLREG) requires there to be a lookout present in order to avoid collisions and the [[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea]] (SOLAS) require ships to be able to assist in search and rescue operations, such as picking up survivors in case of a shipwreck. Without any human on-board autonomous vessels, it will be a difficult task to comply with these regulations.

On-board ship controls and data might be compromised and vulnerable to cyber attacks as the autonomous ships require a constant connection to allow monitoring and control. The complexity of a ship design with various components from different providers can make it hard to detect and stop cyber attacks from occurring. If an autonomous ships would come under cyber attack, regaining control of the ship can become difficult because the lack of on-board crew that can take control manually. Specific systems and risk assessments for autonomous ships are proposed order to address this problem.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katsikas |first1=Sokratis K. |title=Cyber Security of the Autonomous Ship |journal=Proceedings of the 3rd ACM Workshop on Cyber-Physical System Security |date=2017 |pages=55\u201356 |doi=10.1145/3055186.3055191 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3055186.3055191 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |publisher=ACM|isbn=9781450349567 }}</ref>\n\nAnother problem is that due to increased data transmission needed to be sent back and forth between ships and onshore command centers, it increases the chances of \"data swamping,\" where vast amounts of raw data will be produced and transmitted. To achieve more efficient use of storage and communication capacity, smart pre-processing and compression schemes are needed in order to reduce the chances of \"data swamping.\"<ref name=Batalden/>\n\n=== Safety concerns over implementation ===\n\nAutonomous ships might improve safety by reducing human errors in the long run, but during a long transition phase to autonomous ships, these will operate alongside ships steered by humans. How these will interact with each other can create difficulty, in regards to who is to act if the ships are on collision course or how smaller vessels such as low-tech fishing ships may interact with autonomous ships.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blanke |first1=Mogens |last2=Henriques |first2=Michael |last3=Bang |first3=Jakob |title=A pre-analysis on autonomous ships |journal=Danish Technical University |url=https://www.dma.dk/Documents/Publikationer/Autonome%20skibe_DTU_rapport_UK.pdf |accessdate=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Liability and legal issues ===\n\nIf an accident would occur with an autonomous ship, finding out who would be liable creates a difficult challenge, as several parties such as the company, the software provider, hardware provider or the onshore monitoring stations might be at fault. Historically, captains are assumed to be in overall command of the ships and are the first to put under scrutiny if anything does happen. Without a clear leader in charge, it is the role of international regulation to determine who is ultimately responsible for any incidents involving autonomous ships.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Safety and shipping review 2018 |journal=Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty |date=2018 |url=https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Allianz-Safety-and-Shipping-Review-2018-2018_07.pdf |accessdate=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Unmanned surface vehicle]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

The IMO has begun work to review the portions of the treatises that affect autonomous shipping,<ref>{{cite web |title=IMO takes first steps to address autonomous ships |url=http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/Pages/08-MSC-99-MASS-scoping.aspx |publisher=International Maritime Organization |accessdate=30 May 2019}}</ref> yet some argue that work is going to slow as advanced are being made and autonomous ships already being prepared to be launched.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Maxwell |first1=Heather |title=What are the regulatory barriers to autonomous ships? |url=https://safety4sea.com/what-are-the-regulatory-barriers-to-autonomous-ships/ |publisher=Safety4Sea |accessdate=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Cyber security ===\n\n[[Cyber attacks]] have become an increased threat in maritime shipping, where hackers have managed to compromise systems such as AIS, using cheap jammers to spoof [[GPS]] signals and hacking into the servers of container terminals in order to get shipping manifests.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walsh |first1=Don |title=Maritime Cyber Security: Shoal Water Ahead? |journal=United States Naval Institute Proceedings |date=July 2015 |volume=141 |issue=7 |pages=4}}</ref> The maritime industry has been criticized for not being able to keep up with technological innovation, lagging 10\u201320 years behind other industries and leaving computer networks insecure and open for intrusion by [[organized crime]] and state actors.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=L. Caponi |first1=Steven |last2=B. Belmon |first2=Kate |title=Maritime Cyber Security: A Growing Threat Goes Unanswered |journal=Intellectual Property & Technology Law Journal |date=January 2015 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=f}}</ref>\n\nDue to the increased reliance on information and communications technology in semi- and fully autonomous ships, [[cyber security]] becomes an even more serious issue that companies would need to address. On-board ship controls and data might be compromised and vulnerable to cyber attacks as the autonomous ships require a constant connection to allow monitoring and control. The complexity of a ship design with various components from different providers can make it hard to detect and stop cyber attacks from occurring. If an autonomous ships would come under cyber attack, regaining control of the ship can become difficult because the lack of on-board crew that can take control manually. Specific systems and risk assessments for autonomous ships are proposed order to address this problem.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katsikas |first1=Sokratis K. |title=Cyber Security of the Autonomous Ship |journal=Proceedings of the 3rd ACM Workshop on Cyber-Physical System Security |date=2017 |pages=55\u201356 |doi=10.1145/3055186.3055191 |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3055186.3055191 |accessdate=30 May 2019 |publisher=ACM|isbn=9781450349567 }}</ref>\n\nAnother problem is that due to increased data transmission needed to be sent back and forth between ships and onshore command centers, it increases the chances of \"data swamping,\" where vast amounts of raw data will be produced and transmitted. To achieve more efficient use of storage and communication capacity, smart pre-processing and compression schemes are needed in order to reduce the chances of \"data swamping.\"<ref name=Batalden/>\n\n=== Safety concerns over implementation ===\n\nAutonomous ships might improve safety by reducing human errors in the long run, but during a long transition phase to autonomous ships, these will operate alongside ships steered by humans. How these will interact with each other can create difficulty, in regards to who is to act if the ships are on collision course or how smaller vessels such as low-tech fishing ships may interact with autonomous ships.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blanke |first1=Mogens |last2=Henriques |first2=Michael |last3=Bang |first3=Jakob |title=A pre-analysis on autonomous ships |journal=Danish Technical University |url=https://www.dma.dk/Documents/Publikationer/Autonome%20skibe_DTU_rapport_UK.pdf |accessdate=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Liability and legal issues ===\n\nIf an accident would occur with an autonomous ship, finding out who would be liable creates a difficult challenge, as several parties such as the company, the software provider, hardware provider or the onshore monitoring stations might be at fault. Historically, captains are assumed to be in overall command of the ships and are the first to put under scrutiny if anything does happen. Without a clear leader in charge, it is the role of international regulation to determine who is ultimately responsible for any incidents involving autonomous ships.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Safety and shipping review 2018 |journal=Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty |date=2018 |url=https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Allianz-Safety-and-Shipping-Review-2018-2018_07.pdf |accessdate=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Unmanned surface vehicle]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
