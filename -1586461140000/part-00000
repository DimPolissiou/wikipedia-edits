{"title_page": "Displacement current", "text_new": "{{About|electric displacement current|magnetic displacement current|Magnetic current#Magnetic displacement current}}\n{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Physical quantity in electromagnetism}}\n{{electromagnetism|cTopic=Electrodynamics}}\nIn [[electromagnetism]], '''displacement current density''' is the quantity {{math|&part;'''''D'''''/&part;''t''}} appearing in [[Maxwell's equations]] that is defined in terms of the rate of change of {{math|'''''D'''''}}, the [[electric displacement field]]. Displacement current density has the same units as electric current density, and it is a source of the [[magnetic field]] just as actual current is. However it is not an electric current of moving [[Electric charge|charges]], but a time-varying [[electric field]].  In physical materials (as opposed to vacuum), there is also a contribution from the slight motion of charges bound in atoms, called [[dielectric polarization]].\n\nThe idea was conceived by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in his 1861 paper ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=v1YEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false On Physical Lines of Force, Part III]'' in connection with the displacement of electric particles in a [[dielectric]] medium. Maxwell added displacement current to the [[electric current]] term in [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law|Amp\u00e8re's Circuital Law]].  In his 1865 paper [[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]] Maxwell used this amended version of [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law|Amp\u00e8re's Circuital Law]] to derive the [[electromagnetic wave equation]]. This derivation is now generally accepted as a historical landmark in physics by virtue of uniting electricity, magnetism and optics into one single unified theory.  The displacement current term is now seen as a crucial addition that completed Maxwell's equations and is necessary to explain many phenomena, most particularly the existence of [[electromagnetic wave]]s.\n\n== Explanation o\n==\n\nThe [[electric displacement field]] is defined as:\n\n:<math> \\boldsymbol{D} = \\varepsilon_0  \\boldsymbol{E} +  \\boldsymbol{P}\\ .</math>\n\nwhere:\n:''\u03b5<sub>0</sub>'' is the [[permittivity]] of free space\n:'''E''' is the [[electric field intensity]]\n:'''P''' is the [[polarization (electrostatics)|polarization]] of the medium\n\nDifferentiating this equation with respect to time defines the ''displacement current density'', which therefore has two components in a [[dielectric]]:<ref name=Jackson>{{cite book |title=Classical Electrodynamics |author=John D Jackson |edition=3rd |publisher=Wiley |year=1999 |page=238 |isbn=978-0-471-30932-1}}</ref>(see also the \"displacement current\" section of the article \"[[current density]]\")\n\n:<math>  \\boldsymbol{J}_ \\boldsymbol{D} = \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial  \\boldsymbol{E}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial  \\boldsymbol{P}}{\\partial t}\\ .</math>\n\nThe first term on the right hand side is present in material media and in free space. It doesn't necessarily come from any actual movement of charge, but it does have an associated magnetic field, just as a current does due to charge motion. Some authors apply the name ''displacement current'' to the first term by itself.<ref name=Griffiths>For example, see {{cite book |author=David J Griffiths |page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0/page/323 323] |title=Introduction to Electrodynamics |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-13-805326-0 |publisher=Pearson/Addison Wesley |year=1999 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0/page/323 }} and {{cite book |author=Tai L Chow |title=Introduction to Electromagnetic Theory |page=204 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7637-3827-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dpnpMhw1zo8C&pg=PA153&dq=isbn=0-7637-3827-1#PPA204,M1}}</ref>\n\nThe second term on the right hand side, called polarization current density, comes from the change in [[electric polarization|polarization]] of the individual molecules of the dielectric material. Polarization results when, under the influence of an applied [[electric field]], the charges in molecules have moved from a position of exact cancellation. The positive and negative charges in molecules separate, causing an increase in the state of polarization '''''P'''''.  A changing state of polarization corresponds to charge movement and so is equivalent to a current, hence the term \"polarization current\".\n\nThus, <math>\\boldsymbol{I}_ \\boldsymbol{D} =\\iint_{\\mathcal S}\\boldsymbol{J}_ \\boldsymbol{D}\\cdot\\operatorname{d}\\!\\boldsymbol{S}=\\iint_{\\mathcal S}\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{D}}{\\partial t}\\cdot\\operatorname{d}\\!\\boldsymbol{S}=\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t}\\iint_{\\mathcal S} \\boldsymbol{D}\\cdot\\operatorname{d}\\!\\boldsymbol{S}=\\frac{\\partial \\Phi_D}{\\partial t}\\! </math>\n\nThis polarization is the displacement current as it was originally conceived by Maxwell. Maxwell made no special treatment of the vacuum, treating it as a material medium. For Maxwell, the effect of '''''P''''' was simply to change the [[relative permittivity]] ''\u03b5<sub>r</sub>'' in the relation '''''D''''' = ''\u03b5<sub>r</sub>\u03b5<sub>0</sub>'' '''''E'''''.\n\nThe modern justification of displacement current is explained below.\n\n===Isotropic dielectric case===\nIn the case of a very simple dielectric material the [[constitutive relation]] holds:\n\n:<math> \\boldsymbol{D} = \\varepsilon \\boldsymbol{E} \\ , </math>\n\nwhere the [[permittivity]] ''\u03b5 = \u03b5<sub>0</sub> \u03b5<sub>r</sub>'', \n* ''\u03b5<sub>r</sub>'' is the relative permittivity of the dielectric and\n* ''\u03b5<sub>0</sub>'' is the [[electric constant]].\n\nIn this equation the use of ''\u03b5'' accounts for\nthe polarization of the dielectric.\n\nThe [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] value of displacement current may also be expressed in terms of [[electric flux]]:\n\n:<math> I_\\mathrm{D} =\\varepsilon \\frac{\\partial \\Phi_E}{\\partial t}. </math>\n\nThe forms in terms of ''\u03b5'' are correct only for linear [[isotropic]] materials.  More generally ''\u03b5'' may be replaced by a [[tensor]], may depend upon the electric field itself, and may exhibit frequency dependence (dispersion).\n\nFor a linear isotropic dielectric, the polarization '''''P''''' is given by:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{P} = \\varepsilon_0 \\chi_e \\boldsymbol{E} = \\varepsilon_0 (\\varepsilon_r - 1) \\boldsymbol{E}</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c7<sub>e</sub>'' is known as the [[electric susceptibility]] of the dielectric. Note that:\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 = (1+\\chi_e)\\varepsilon_0. </math>\n\n==Necessity==\nSome implications of the displacement current follow, which agree with experimental observation, and with the requirements of logical consistency for the theory of electromagnetism.\n\n===Generalizing Amp\u00e8re's circuital law===\n\n====Current in capacitors====\nAn example illustrating the need for the displacement current arises in connection with [[capacitor]]s with no medium between the plates. Consider the charging capacitor in the figure. The capacitor is in a circuit that causes equal and opposite charges to appear on the left plate and the right plate, charging the capacitor and increasing the electric field between its plates. No actual charge is transported through the vacuum between its plates. Nonetheless, a magnetic field exists between the plates as though a current were present there as well. One explanation is that a ''displacement current'' ''I<sub>D</sub>'' \"flows\" in the vacuum, and this current produces the magnetic field in the region between the plates according to [[Amp\u00e8re's law]]:<ref name=Palmer>{{cite book |title=Advanced University Physics |page=214 |author= Stuart B.

Consider the current in the imaginary cylindrical surface shown surrounding the left plate. A current, say ''I'', passes outward through the left surface ''L'' of the cylinder, but no conduction current (no transport of real charges) crosses the right surface ''R''. Notice that the electric field between the plates ''E'' increases as the capacitor charges.  That is, in a manner described by [[Gauss's law]], assuming no dielectric between the plates:\n\n:<math> Q(t) =\\varepsilon_0  \\oint_{\\mathcal S} d \\mathbf{\\mathcal S} \\ \\boldsymbol{ \\cdot} \\  \\boldsymbol{ E} (t) \\ , </math>\n\nwhere ''S'' refers to the imaginary cylindrical surface.

The electric field at surface ''L'' is zero because surface ''L'' is in the outside of the capacitor. Under the assumption of a uniform electric field distribution inside the capacitor, the displacement current density ''J<sub>D</sub>'' is found by dividing by the area of the surface:\n\n:<math> J_D = \\frac{I_D}{ S}= \\frac{I}{ S}=  \\varepsilon_0  \\frac {\\partial  E}{\\partial t}  = \\frac {\\partial  D}{\\partial t}   \\ , </math>\n\nwhere  ''I'' is the current leaving the cylindrical surface (which must equal ''I<sub>D</sub>'') and ''J<sub>D</sub>''  is the flow of charge per unit area into the cylindrical surface through the face ''R''.\n\nCombining these results, the magnetic field is found using the integral form of [[Amp\u00e8re's law]] with an arbitrary choice of contour provided the displacement current density term is added to the conduction current density (the Amp\u00e8re-Maxwell equation):<ref name=\"Feynman\" >{{cite book\n  | last = Feynman\n  | first = Richard P.\n  | authorlink = \n  |author2=Robert Leighton|author3=Matthew Sands\n  | title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. 2\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1963\n  | location = Massachusetts, USA\n  | pages = 18\u20134\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/feynmanlectureso0003feyn\n  | url-access = registration\n  | doi = \n  | isbn =978-0-201-02116-5 }}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\oint_{\\partial S} \\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = \\mu_0 \\int_S \\left(\\boldsymbol{J} + \\epsilon_0 \\frac {\\partial \\boldsymbol{E}}{\\partial t}\\right) \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{S} \\, </math>\n\nThis equation says that the integral of the magnetic field '''''B''''' around a loop ''\u2202S'' is equal to the integrated current '''''J''''' through any surface spanning the loop, plus the displacement current term ''\u03b5<sub>0 </sub>\u2202'''E''' / \u2202t'' through the surface. \n{{-}}\n[[File:Displacement current in capacitor.svg|thumb|200px|Example showing two surfaces ''S<sub>1</sub>'' and ''S<sub>2</sub>'' that share the same bounding contour ''\u2202S''. However, ''S<sub>1</sub>'' is pierced by conduction current, while ''S<sub>2</sub>'' is pierced by displacement current.]]\n\nAs depicted in the figure to the right, the current crossing surface ''S<sub>1</sub>'' is entirely conduction current.  Applying the Amp\u00e8re-Maxwell equation to surface ''S<sub>1</sub>'' yields:\n\n:<math>B = \\frac {\\mu_0 I}{2 \\pi r}\\,</math>\n\nHowever, the current crossing surface ''S<sub>2</sub>'' is entirely displacement current.  Applying this law to surface ''S<sub>2</sub>'', which is bounded by exactly the same curve <math>\\partial S </math>, but lies between the plates, produces:\n\n:<math>B = \\frac {\\mu_0 I_D}{2 \\pi r}\\,</math>\n\nAny surface ''S<sub>1</sub>'' that intersects the wire has current ''I'' passing through it so [[Amp\u00e8re's law]] gives the correct magnetic field.  However a second surface ''S<sub>2</sub>'' bounded by the same loop ''\u03b4S'' could be drawn passing between the capacitor plates, therefore having no current passing through it.  Without the displacement current term Ampere's law would give zero magnetic field for this surface.  Therefore, without the displacement current term Ampere's law gives inconsistent results, the magnetic field would depend on the surface chosen for integration.  Thus the displacement current term  ''\u03b5<sub>0 </sub>\u2202'''E''' / \u2202t'' is necessary as a second source term which gives the correct magnetic field when the surface of integration passes between the capacitor plates.  Because the current is increasing the charge on the capacitor's plates, the electric field between the plates is increasing, and the rate of change of electric field gives the correct value for the field '''''B''''' found above.\n\n====Mathematical formulation====\nIn a more mathematical vein, the same results can be obtained from the underlying differential equations. Consider for simplicity a non-magnetic medium where the [[Magnetic permeability#Relative permeability|relative magnetic permeability]] is unity, and the complication of [[Magnetization current#Magnetization current|magnetization current]] (bound current) is absent, so that '''''M'''''=0 and '''''J'''''='''''J'''''<sub>f</sub>.\nThe current leaving a volume must equal the rate of decrease of charge in a volume. In differential form this [[Current density#Continuity equation|continuity equation]] becomes:\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{J_f} = -\\frac {\\partial \\rho_f}{\\partial t} \\ , </math>\n\nwhere the left side is the divergence of the free current density and the right side is the rate of decrease of the free charge density. However, [[Amp\u00e8re's law]] in its original form states:\n\n:<math> \\boldsymbol{ \\nabla \\times B} = \\mu_0 \\boldsymbol J_f \\ , </math>\n\nwhich implies that the divergence of the current term vanishes, contradicting the continuity equation. (Vanishing of the ''divergence'' is a result of the [[Vector calculus identities#Divergence of the curl|mathematical identity]] that states the divergence of a ''curl'' is always zero.)

Few topics in modern physics have caused as much confusion and misunderstanding as that of displacement current.<ref name=Siegel2>{{cite book |title=Innovation in Maxwell's Electromagnetic Theory |author= Daniel M.

Maxwell's derivation is unrelated to the modern day derivation for displacement current in the vacuum, which is based on consistency between [[Ampere's circuital law]] for the magnetic field and the continuity equation for electric charge.\n\nMaxwell's purpose is stated by him at (Part I, p.&nbsp;161):\n\n{{quote|I propose now to examine magnetic phenomena from a mechanical point of view, and to determine what tensions in, or motions of, a medium are capable of producing the mechanical phenomena observed.}}\n\nHe is careful to point out the treatment is one of analogy:\n\n{{quote|The author of this method of representation does not attempt to explain the origin of the observed forces by the effects due to these strains in the elastic solid, but makes use of the mathematical analogies of the two problems to assist the imagination in the study of both.}}\n\nIn part III, in relation to displacement current, he says\n\n{{quote|I conceived the rotating matter to be the substance of certain cells, divided from each other by cell-walls composed of particles which are very small compared with the cells, and that it is by the motions of these particles, and their tangential action on the substance in the cells, that the rotation is communicated from one cell to another.}}\n\nClearly Maxwell was driving at magnetization even though the same introduction clearly talks about dielectric polarization.\n\nMaxwell concluded, using Newton's equation for the speed of sound (''Lines of Force'', Part III, equation (132)), that \u201clight consists of transverse undulations in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.\u201d\n\nBut although the above quotations point towards a magnetic explanation for displacement current, for example, based upon the divergence of the above ''curl'' equation, Maxwell's explanation ultimately stressed linear polarization of dielectrics:\n\n{{quote|This displacement...is the commencement of a current...The amount of displacement depends on the nature of the body, and on the electromotive force so that if ''h'' is the displacement, ''R'' the electromotive force, and ''E'' a coefficient depending on the nature of the dielectric:\n:::<math>R = -4\\pi \\mathrm E^2 h \\ ; </math>\nand if ''r'' is the value of the electric current due to displacement\n:::<math>r = \\frac{dh}{dt}\\ , </math>\nThese relations are independent of any theory about the mechanism of dielectrics; but when we find electromotive force producing electric displacement in a dielectric, and when we find the dielectric recovering from its state of electric displacement...we cannot help regarding the phenomena as those of an elastic body, yielding to a pressure and recovering its form when the pressure is removed.\u2014Part III \u2013 ''The theory of molecular vortices applied to statical electricity'' , pp. 14\u201315}}\n\nWith some change of symbols (and units) combined with the results deduced in the section \"'''Current in capacitors'''\" : ''r \u2192 J'', ''R \u2192 \u2212E'' and the material constant  E<sup>\u22122</sup> \u2192 ''4\u03c0 \u03b5<sub>r</sub>\u03b5<sub>0</sub>'' these equations take the familiar form between a parallel plate capacitor with uniform electric field, and neglecting fringing effects around the edges of the plates:\n\n::<math>J = \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac {1}{4 \\pi \\mathrm E^2} \\mathit E = \\frac{d}{dt} \\varepsilon_r\\varepsilon_0 \\mathit E = \\frac{d}{dt} \\mathit D \\ . </math>\n\nWhen it came to deriving the electromagnetic wave equation from displacement current in his 1865 paper [[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]], he got around the problem of the non-zero divergence associated with Gauss's law and dielectric displacement by eliminating the Gauss term and deriving the wave equation exclusively for the solenoidal magnetic field vector.\n\nMaxwell's emphasis on polarization diverted attention towards the electric capacitor circuit, and led to the common belief that Maxwell conceived of displacement current so as to maintain conservation of charge in an electric capacitor circuit. There are a variety of debatable notions about Maxwell's thinking, ranging from his supposed desire to perfect the symmetry of the field equations to the desire to achieve compatibility with the continuity equation.<ref name=Nahin>{{cite book |title=Oliver Heaviside: The Life, Work, and Times of an Electrical Genius of the Victorian Age |url=https://books.google.com/?id=e9wEntQmA0IC&pg=PA109&dq=history+Maxwell+symmetry+of+field+equations |page=109 |author=Paul J.

Displacement current density has the same units as electric current density, and it is a source of the [[magnetic field]] just as actual current is. However it is not an electric current of moving [[Electric charge|charges]], but a time-varying [[electric field]].  In physical materials (as opposed to vacuum), there is also a contribution from the slight motion of charges bound in atoms, called [[dielectric polarization]].\n\nThe idea was conceived by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in his 1861 paper ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=v1YEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false On Physical Lines of Force, Part III]'' in connection with the displacement of electric particles in a [[dielectric]] medium. Maxwell added displacement current to the [[electric current]] term in [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law|Amp\u00e8re's Circuital Law]].  In his 1865 paper [[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]] Maxwell used this amended version of [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law|Amp\u00e8re's Circuital Law]] to derive the [[electromagnetic wave equation]]. This derivation is now generally accepted as a historical landmark in physics by virtue of uniting electricity, magnetism and optics into one single unified theory.  The displacement current term is now seen as a crucial addition that completed Maxwell's equations and is necessary to explain many phenomena, most particularly the existence of [[electromagnetic wave]]s.\n\n== Explanation ==\n\nThe [[electric displacement field]] is defined as:\n\n:<math> \\boldsymbol{D} = \\varepsilon_0  \\boldsymbol{E} +  \\boldsymbol{P}\\ .</math>\n\nwhere:\n:''\u03b5<sub>0</sub>'' is the [[permittivity]] of free space\n:'''E''' is the [[electric field intensity]]\n:'''P''' is the [[polarization (electrostatics)|polarization]] of the medium\n\nDifferentiating this equation with respect to time defines the ''displacement current density'', which therefore has two components in a [[dielectric]]:<ref name=Jackson>{{cite book |title=Classical Electrodynamics |author=John D Jackson |edition=3rd |publisher=Wiley |year=1999 |page=238 |isbn=978-0-471-30932-1}}</ref>(see also the \"displacement current\" section of the article \"[[current density]]\")\n\n:<math>  \\boldsymbol{J}_ \\boldsymbol{D} = \\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial  \\boldsymbol{E}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial  \\boldsymbol{P}}{\\partial t}\\ .</math>\n\nThe first term on the right hand side is present in material media and in free space. It doesn't necessarily come from any actual movement of charge, but it does have an associated magnetic field, just as a current does due to charge motion. Some authors apply the name ''displacement current'' to the first term by itself.<ref name=Griffiths>For example, see {{cite book |author=David J Griffiths |page=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0/page/323 323] |title=Introduction to Electrodynamics |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-13-805326-0 |publisher=Pearson/Addison Wesley |year=1999 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoel00grif_0/page/323 }} and {{cite book |author=Tai L Chow |title=Introduction to Electromagnetic Theory |page=204 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7637-3827-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dpnpMhw1zo8C&pg=PA153&dq=isbn=0-7637-3827-1#PPA204,M1}}</ref>\n\nThe second term on the right hand side, called polarization current density, comes from the change in [[electric polarization|polarization]] of the individual molecules of the dielectric material. Polarization results when, under the influence of an applied [[electric field]], the charges in molecules have moved from a position of exact cancellation. The positive and negative charges in molecules separate, causing an increase in the state of polarization '''''P'''''.  A changing state of polarization corresponds to charge movement and so is equivalent to a current, hence the term \"polarization current\".\n\nThus, <math>\\boldsymbol{I}_ \\boldsymbol{D} =\\iint_{\\mathcal S}\\boldsymbol{J}_ \\boldsymbol{D}\\cdot\\operatorname{d}\\!\\boldsymbol{S}=\\iint_{\\mathcal S}\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{D}}{\\partial t}\\cdot\\operatorname{d}\\!\\boldsymbol{S}=\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial t}\\iint_{\\mathcal S} \\boldsymbol{D}\\cdot\\operatorname{d}\\!\\boldsymbol{S}=\\frac{\\partial \\Phi_D}{\\partial t}\\! </math>\n\nThis polarization is the displacement current as it was originally conceived by Maxwell. Maxwell made no special treatment of the vacuum, treating it as a material medium. For Maxwell, the effect of '''''P''''' was simply to change the [[relative permittivity]] ''\u03b5<sub>r</sub>'' in the relation '''''D''''' = ''\u03b5<sub>r</sub>\u03b5<sub>0</sub>'' '''''E'''''.\n\nThe modern justification of displacement current is explained below.\n\n===Isotropic dielectric case===\nIn the case of a very simple dielectric material the [[constitutive relation]] holds:\n\n:<math> \\boldsymbol{D} = \\varepsilon \\boldsymbol{E} \\ , </math>\n\nwhere the [[permittivity]] ''\u03b5 = \u03b5<sub>0</sub> \u03b5<sub>r</sub>'', \n* ''\u03b5<sub>r</sub>'' is the relative permittivity of the dielectric and\n* ''\u03b5<sub>0</sub>'' is the [[electric constant]].\n\nIn this equation the use of ''\u03b5'' accounts for\nthe polarization of the dielectric.\n\nThe [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] value of displacement current may also be expressed in terms of [[electric flux]]:\n\n:<math> I_\\mathrm{D} =\\varepsilon \\frac{\\partial \\Phi_E}{\\partial t}. </math>\n\nThe forms in terms of ''\u03b5'' are correct only for linear [[isotropic]] materials.  More generally ''\u03b5'' may be replaced by a [[tensor]], may depend upon the electric field itself, and may exhibit frequency dependence (dispersion).\n\nFor a linear isotropic dielectric, the polarization '''''P''''' is given by:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{P} = \\varepsilon_0 \\chi_e \\boldsymbol{E} = \\varepsilon_0 (\\varepsilon_r - 1) \\boldsymbol{E}</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c7<sub>e</sub>'' is known as the [[electric susceptibility]] of the dielectric. Note that:\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 = (1+\\chi_e)\\varepsilon_0. </math>\n\n==Necessity==\nSome implications of the displacement current follow, which agree with experimental observation, and with the requirements of logical consistency for the theory of electromagnetism.\n\n===Generalizing Amp\u00e8re's circuital law===\n\n====Current in capacitors====\nAn example illustrating the need for the displacement current arises in connection with [[capacitor]]s with no medium between the plates. Consider the charging capacitor in the figure. The capacitor is in a circuit that causes equal and opposite charges to appear on the left plate and the right plate, charging the capacitor and increasing the electric field between its plates. No actual charge is transported through the vacuum between its plates. Nonetheless, a magnetic field exists between the plates as though a current were present there as well. One explanation is that a ''displacement current'' ''I<sub>D</sub>'' \"flows\" in the vacuum, and this current produces the magnetic field in the region between the plates according to [[Amp\u00e8re's law]]:<ref name=Palmer>{{cite book |title=Advanced University Physics |page=214 |author= Stuart B.

Consider the current in the imaginary cylindrical surface shown surrounding the left plate. A current, say ''I'', passes outward through the left surface ''L'' of the cylinder, but no conduction current (no transport of real charges) crosses the right surface ''R''. Notice that the electric field between the plates ''E'' increases as the capacitor charges.  That is, in a manner described by [[Gauss's law]], assuming no dielectric between the plates:\n\n:<math> Q(t) =\\varepsilon_0  \\oint_{\\mathcal S} d \\mathbf{\\mathcal S} \\ \\boldsymbol{ \\cdot} \\  \\boldsymbol{ E} (t) \\ , </math>\n\nwhere ''S'' refers to the imaginary cylindrical surface.

The electric field at surface ''L'' is zero because surface ''L'' is in the outside of the capacitor. Under the assumption of a uniform electric field distribution inside the capacitor, the displacement current density ''J<sub>D</sub>'' is found by dividing by the area of the surface:\n\n:<math> J_D = \\frac{I_D}{ S}= \\frac{I}{ S}=  \\varepsilon_0  \\frac {\\partial  E}{\\partial t}  = \\frac {\\partial  D}{\\partial t}   \\ , </math>\n\nwhere  ''I'' is the current leaving the cylindrical surface (which must equal ''I<sub>D</sub>'') and ''J<sub>D</sub>''  is the flow of charge per unit area into the cylindrical surface through the face ''R''.\n\nCombining these results, the magnetic field is found using the integral form of [[Amp\u00e8re's law]] with an arbitrary choice of contour provided the displacement current density term is added to the conduction current density (the Amp\u00e8re-Maxwell equation):<ref name=\"Feynman\" >{{cite book\n  | last = Feynman\n  | first = Richard P.\n  | authorlink = \n  |author2=Robert Leighton|author3=Matthew Sands\n  | title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. 2\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1963\n  | location = Massachusetts, USA\n  | pages = 18\u20134\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/feynmanlectureso0003feyn\n  | url-access = registration\n  | doi = \n  | isbn =978-0-201-02116-5 }}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\oint_{\\partial S} \\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{\\ell} = \\mu_0 \\int_S \\left(\\boldsymbol{J} + \\epsilon_0 \\frac {\\partial \\boldsymbol{E}}{\\partial t}\\right) \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{S} \\, </math>\n\nThis equation says that the integral of the magnetic field '''''B''''' around a loop ''\u2202S'' is equal to the integrated current '''''J''''' through any surface spanning the loop, plus the displacement current term ''\u03b5<sub>0 </sub>\u2202'''E''' / \u2202t'' through the surface. \n{{-}}\n[[File:Displacement current in capacitor.svg|thumb|200px|Example showing two surfaces ''S<sub>1</sub>'' and ''S<sub>2</sub>'' that share the same bounding contour ''\u2202S''. However, ''S<sub>1</sub>'' is pierced by conduction current, while ''S<sub>2</sub>'' is pierced by displacement current.]]\n\nAs depicted in the figure to the right, the current crossing surface ''S<sub>1</sub>'' is entirely conduction current.  Applying the Amp\u00e8re-Maxwell equation to surface ''S<sub>1</sub>'' yields:\n\n:<math>B = \\frac {\\mu_0 I}{2 \\pi r}\\,</math>\n\nHowever, the current crossing surface ''S<sub>2</sub>'' is entirely displacement current.  Applying this law to surface ''S<sub>2</sub>'', which is bounded by exactly the same curve <math>\\partial S </math>, but lies between the plates, produces:\n\n:<math>B = \\frac {\\mu_0 I_D}{2 \\pi r}\\,</math>\n\nAny surface ''S<sub>1</sub>'' that intersects the wire has current ''I'' passing through it so [[Amp\u00e8re's law]] gives the correct magnetic field.  However a second surface ''S<sub>2</sub>'' bounded by the same loop ''\u03b4S'' could be drawn passing between the capacitor plates, therefore having no current passing through it.  Without the displacement current term Ampere's law would give zero magnetic field for this surface.  Therefore, without the displacement current term Ampere's law gives inconsistent results, the magnetic field would depend on the surface chosen for integration.  Thus the displacement current term  ''\u03b5<sub>0 </sub>\u2202'''E''' / \u2202t'' is necessary as a second source term which gives the correct magnetic field when the surface of integration passes between the capacitor plates.  Because the current is increasing the charge on the capacitor's plates, the electric field between the plates is increasing, and the rate of change of electric field gives the correct value for the field '''''B''''' found above.\n\n====Mathematical formulation====\nIn a more mathematical vein, the same results can be obtained from the underlying differential equations. Consider for simplicity a non-magnetic medium where the [[Magnetic permeability#Relative permeability|relative magnetic permeability]] is unity, and the complication of [[Magnetization current#Magnetization current|magnetization current]] (bound current) is absent, so that '''''M'''''=0 and '''''J'''''='''''J'''''<sub>f</sub>.\nThe current leaving a volume must equal the rate of decrease of charge in a volume. In differential form this [[Current density#Continuity equation|continuity equation]] becomes:\n\n:<math> \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{J_f} = -\\frac {\\partial \\rho_f}{\\partial t} \\ , </math>\n\nwhere the left side is the divergence of the free current density and the right side is the rate of decrease of the free charge density.

The '''\u2207'''''\u03c6'' component on the right hand side is the Gauss's law component, and this is the component that is relevant to the conservation of charge argument above. The second term on the right-hand side is the one relevant to the electromagnetic wave equation, because it is the term that contributes to the ''curl'' of '''''E'''''. Because of the vector identity that says the ''curl'' of a ''gradient'' is zero, '''\u2207'''''\u03c6'' does not contribute to '''\u2207\u00d7''E'''''.\n\n== History and interpretation ==\n\nMaxwell's displacement current was postulated in part III of his 1861 paper '[[Media:On Physical Lines of Force.pdf|On Physical Lines of Force]]'. Few topics in modern physics have caused as much confusion and misunderstanding as that of displacement current.<ref name=Siegel2>{{cite book |title=Innovation in Maxwell's Electromagnetic Theory |author= Daniel M. Siegel |isbn=978-0-521-53329-4 |page=85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AbQq85U8K0gC&pg=PA123&dq=Kirchhoff+displacement+current#PPA85,M1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003}}</ref>  This is in part due to the fact that Maxwell used a sea of molecular vortices in his derivation, while modern textbooks operate on the basis that displacement current can exist in free space. Maxwell's derivation is unrelated to the modern day derivation for displacement current in the vacuum, which is based on consistency between [[Ampere's circuital law]] for the magnetic field and the continuity equation for electric charge.\n\nMaxwell's purpose is stated by him at (Part I, p.&nbsp;161):\n\n{{quote|I propose now to examine magnetic phenomena from a mechanical point of view, and to determine what tensions in, or motions of, a medium are capable of producing the mechanical phenomena observed.}}\n\nHe is careful to point out the treatment is one of analogy:\n\n{{quote|The author of this method of representation does not attempt to explain the origin of the observed forces by the effects due to these strains in the elastic solid, but makes use of the mathematical analogies of the two problems to assist the imagination in the study of both.}}\n\nIn part III, in relation to displacement current, he says\n\n{{quote|I conceived the rotating matter to be the substance of certain cells, divided from each other by cell-walls composed of particles which are very small compared with the cells, and that it is by the motions of these particles, and their tangential action on the substance in the cells, that the rotation is communicated from one cell to another.}}\n\nClearly Maxwell was driving at magnetization even though the same introduction clearly talks about dielectric polarization.\n\nMaxwell concluded, using Newton's equation for the speed of sound (''Lines of Force'', Part III, equation (132)), that \u201clight consists of transverse undulations in the same medium that is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.\u201d\n\nBut although the above quotations point towards a magnetic explanation for displacement current, for example, based upon the divergence of the above ''curl'' equation, Maxwell's explanation ultimately stressed linear polarization of dielectrics:\n\n{{quote|This displacement...is the commencement of a current...The amount of displacement depends on the nature of the body, and on the electromotive force so that if ''h'' is the displacement, ''R'' the electromotive force, and ''E'' a coefficient depending on the nature of the dielectric:\n:::<math>R = -4\\pi \\mathrm E^2 h \\ ; </math>\nand if ''r'' is the value of the electric current due to displacement\n:::<math>r = \\frac{dh}{dt}\\ , </math>\nThese relations are independent of any theory about the mechanism of dielectrics; but when we find electromotive force producing electric displacement in a dielectric, and when we find the dielectric recovering from its state of electric displacement...we cannot help regarding the phenomena as those of an elastic body, yielding to a pressure and recovering its form when the pressure is removed.\u2014Part III \u2013 ''The theory of molecular vortices applied to statical electricity'' , pp. 14\u201315}}\n\nWith some change of symbols (and units) combined with the results deduced in the section \"'''Current in capacitors'''\" : ''r \u2192 J'', ''R \u2192 \u2212E'' and the material constant  E<sup>\u22122</sup> \u2192 ''4\u03c0 \u03b5<sub>r</sub>\u03b5<sub>0</sub>'' these equations take the familiar form between a parallel plate capacitor with uniform electric field, and neglecting fringing effects around the edges of the plates:\n\n::<math>J = \\frac{d}{dt} \\frac {1}{4 \\pi \\mathrm E^2} \\mathit E = \\frac{d}{dt} \\varepsilon_r\\varepsilon_0 \\mathit E = \\frac{d}{dt} \\mathit D \\ . </math>\n\nWhen it came to deriving the electromagnetic wave equation from displacement current in his 1865 paper [[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]], he got around the problem of the non-zero divergence associated with Gauss's law and dielectric displacement by eliminating the Gauss term and deriving the wave equation exclusively for the solenoidal magnetic field vector.\n\nMaxwell's emphasis on polarization diverted attention towards the electric capacitor circuit, and led to the common belief that Maxwell conceived of displacement current so as to maintain conservation of charge in an electric capacitor circuit. There are a variety of debatable notions about Maxwell's thinking, ranging from his supposed desire to perfect the symmetry of the field equations to the desire to achieve compatibility with the continuity equation.<ref name=Nahin>{{cite book |title=Oliver Heaviside: The Life, Work, and Times of an Electrical Genius of the Victorian Age |url=https://books.google.com/?id=e9wEntQmA0IC&pg=PA109&dq=history+Maxwell+symmetry+of+field+equations |page=109 |author=Paul J.
