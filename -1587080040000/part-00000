kicked off their 2013 campaign with a hard-fought, ugly win over the Carolina Panthers, 12\u20137. This game marked Russell Wilson's first 300-yard passing game, and Cam Newton's worst career performance, posting 125 yards through the air, a career low.\n\nThe first quarter ended equal for both teams, as both sides exchanged a couple of punts. Seattle took their third drive of the game in the second quarter, and drove into the red zone, capping it with a [[Steven Hauschka]] 27-yard field goal. Carolina responded immediately, and taking advantage of a couple of Seattle penalties, and some big runs by [[DeAngelo Williams]], with [[Cam Newton]] hitting [[Steve Smith (wide receiver, born 1979)|Steve Smith]] for a 3-yard TD. Seattle responded with a drive to around the Carolina 27 yard line, but [[Charles Godfrey (American football)|Charles Godfrey]] sacked [[Russell Wilson]] and stripped the football, which Carolina recovered. So the first half ended 7\u20133, Carolina.\n\nThe second half began with a defensive battle between both sides. Seattle then broke the deadlock with a [[Steven Hauschka]] 40-yard field goal, on a drive that lasted over 4 minutes, cutting the lead to 7\u20136. After forcing Carolina to punt midway through the fourth quarter, Seattle's offense produced its finest drive of the day. A couple of [[Russell Wilson]] passes, followed by a [[Robert Turbin]] 15-yard scamper, set up Seattle at the Panthers' 43 yard line. [[Russell Wilson]] overthrew receiver Stephen Williams on first down, but on second down and 10, by using exactly the same play, Wilson connected with second-year man [[Jermaine Kearse]] for a 43-yard score, with 10 minutes left to play. They failed the two-point conversion however, so Seattle had a 12\u20137 lead. Carolina responded by using [[DeAngelo Williams]] on some big runs. Inside the Seattle 35 yard line, Williams took off for a 24-yard scamper, and looked like he was going to score, however at the last possible moment, [[Earl Thomas (defensive back)|Earl Thomas]] forced Williams to fumble inside the 10 yard line.\n\n====Week 2: vs. San Francisco 49ers====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|Seattle Seahawks|year=2013|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Two: San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n |date=September 15\n |time=5:31 p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|local]]\n |road=49ers\n |R1=0|R2=0|R3=3|R4=0\n |home='''Seahawks'''\n |H1=0|H2=5|H3=7|H4=17\n |stadium=[[CenturyLink Field]], [[Seattle]]\n |attendance=68,338\n |weather=cloudy, {{convert|64|F|C}}, 81% humidity, wind SSW {{convert|6|mph|km/h}}\n |referee=[[John Parry (American football official)|John Parry]]\n |TV=[[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Al Michaels]], [[Cris Collinsworth]] & [[Michele Tafoya]]\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2013091513/2013/REG2/49ers@seahawks#tab=analyze&analyze=playbyplay Gamecenter], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/55867/SEA_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*No scoring plays\n'''Second quarter'''\n* SEA \u2013 [[Safety (gridiron football score)|Safety]], San Francisco holding in end zone, 10:39 (SEA&nbsp;2\u20130)\n* SEA \u2013 [[Steven Hauschka]] 30-yard field goal, 5:52 (SEA&nbsp;5\u20130)\n'''Third quarter'''\n* SEA \u2013 [[Marshawn Lynch]] 14-yard run (Steven Hauschka kick), 9:12 (SEA&nbsp;12\u20130)\n* SF \u2013 [[Phil Dawson]] 21-yard field goal, 4:20 (SEA&nbsp;12\u20133)\n'''Fourth quarter'''\n* SEA \u2013 Marshawn Lynch 7-yard pass from [[Russell Wilson]] (Steven Hauschka kick), 13:44 (SEA&nbsp;19\u20133)\n* SEA \u2013 Steven Hauschka 37-yard field goal, 11:31 (SEA&nbsp;22\u20133)\n* SEA \u2013 [[Marshawn Lynch]] 2-yard run (Steven Hauschka kick), 4:22 (SEA&nbsp;29\u20133)\n |stats=\n'''Top passers'''\n* SF \u2013 [[Colin Kaepernick]]: 13/28, 127 yds, 3 INT\n* SEA \u2013 [[Russell Wilson]]: 8/19, 142 yds, 1 TD, 1 INT\n'''Top rushers'''\n* SF \u2013 Colin Kaepernick: 9 car, 87 yds\n* SEA \u2013 [[Marshawn Lynch]]: 28 car, 98 yds, 2 TD\n'''Top receivers'''\n* SF \u2013 [[Kyle Williams (wide receiver)|Kyle Williams]]: 4 rec, 39 yds\n* SEA \u2013 [[Doug Baldwin]]: 1 rec, 51 yds\n'''Top tacklers'''\n* SF \u2013 [[NaVorro Bowman]]: 4 solo, 7 asst\n* SEA \u2013 [[Bobby Wagner]]: 2 solo, 5 asst, {{tooltip|pd|pass defended}}\n'''Team''' \u2013 {{tooltip|pass|passing yards}} \u2013 {{tooltip|rush|rushing yards}} \u2013 {{tooltip|total|total yards}} \u2013 {{tooltip|to|turnovers}}\n* SF \u2013 107 \u2013 100 \u2013 207 \u2013 5\n* SEA \u2013 118 \u2013 172 \u2013 290 \u2013 1\n}}\nIn week 2, the Seahawks took on their division rivals, the San Francisco 49ers. Prior to the season, NFL analysts{{Who|date=January 2014}} rated this rivalry as the top upcoming rivalry, as well as the top rivalry of the decade. Both teams proved that point, when they had an arms race in the off-season, Seattle picking up [[Percy Harvin]] and San Francisco picking [[Anquan Boldin]] in the off-season, among others. Last season, the teams were 1\u20131 against each other, Seattle being the better team, as they blew out the Niners 42\u201313 in the last meeting in Seattle, coincidentally, also on Sunday Night Football. It was also a day that [[Russell Wilson]] and [[Colin Kaepernick]] appeared to bet an eyebrow, with the loser shaving his eyebrow; this was later revealed to be a publicity stunt.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/09/wilson-kaepernick-eyebrow-bet-reaches-anticlimactic-conclusion/ | work=USA Today | title=Russell Wilson and Colin Kaepernick's eyebrow bet reaches dull conclusion}}</ref> Finally, it was a day where former Seahawk [[Shaun Alexander]] would raise the 12th man flag.\n\nThe game began quietly though, as both sides failed to establish a rhythm. The game was delayed midway through the first quarter due to lightning in the vicinity of the stadium, the second such case in the 2013 season (Ravens-Broncos kickoff game in week 1 was the first). After getting back onto the field, the 49ers blocked a Seahawks punt and got the ball in Seattle territory. However, Seattle claimed a whistle was heard from the crowd, which confused the linemen and the punter. That claim was later justified by NBC analyst [[Cris Collinsworth]]. The Niners took advantage and drove to the Seattle 10-yard line. However, on third down, [[Earl Thomas (defensive back)|Earl Thomas]] intercepted a [[Colin Kaepernick]] pass, and Seattle regained possession. A few plays later, [[Russell Wilson]] was intercepted by rookie [[Eric Reid (American football)|Eric Reid]], and the tug of war continued into the second quarter.\n\nAll was quiet until midway through the second quarter, where fullback [[Bruce Miller (American football)|Bruce Miller]] was caught holding in the endzone, the result of which was a safety, and a Seattle 2\u20130 lead. Later on, defensive end [[Cliff Avril]] strip sacked Kaepernick and [[K. J. Wright]] recovered for Seattle, the result of which was a [[Steven Hauschka]] 30-yard field goal. Halftime came with a small 5\u20130 Seahawks lead. The game was pretty dark and messy at that point, the only bright side being Seattle running back [[Marshawn Lynch]].\n\nIn the third quarter, the Seahawks came out roaring. On third and 12, Wilson connected with receiver [[Doug Baldwin]] for a 51-yard gain to inside the 49ers 25 yard line. A few plays later, Lynch took it to the house on a 14-yard run, 12\u20130 Seattle. The 49ers responded with a drive to the Seattle 6-yard line, capped of by [[Phil Dawson]] 21-yard field goal, that included a 28-yard scramble by Kaepernick, 12\u20133 Seahawks. However, that would be it for the Niners, and the third quarter.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Seahawks demolished the Niners on all phases of play. It started with Wilson hitting Lynch for a 7-yard score on third down. A few plays into the Niners next drive, Kaepernick was intercepted by [[Richard Sherman (American football)|Richard Sherman]], who took it to the 49ers 25-yard line. That resulted in a 37-yard [[Steven Hauschka]] field goal. On the ensuing Niners drive, Kaepernick was intercepted again, this time by safety [[Kam Chancellor]], who had signed a contract extension earlier in the year. Lynch scored on a 2-yard run on the next play. Seattle led 29\u20133. The 49ers fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Seattle recovered.\n\nSeattle won, in convincing style, silencing any critics. The 12th man also broke a Guinness world record, for the loudest outdoor stadium. Yet again, Seattle dominated on SNF, and [[Pete Carroll]] improved to 3\u20134 overall against the Niners, and 2\u20133 against bitter rival [[Jim Harbaugh]]. Seattle was now 2\u20130, and still unbeaten at home.\n\n====Week 3: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|Seattle Seahawks|year=2013|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Three: Jacksonville Jaguars at Seattle Seahawks&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n |date=September 22\n |time=1:26 p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|local]]\n |road=Jaguars\n |R1=0|R2=0|R3=10|R4=7\n |home='''Seahawks'''\n |H1=7|H2=17|H3=14|H4=7\n |stadium=[[CenturyLink Field]], [[Seattle]]\n |attendance=68,087\n |weather=rain, {{convert|61|F|C}}, 87% humidity, wind S {{convert|17|mph|km/h}}\n |referee=[[Bill Vinovich]]\n |TV=[[NFL on CBS|CBS]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Bill Macatee]] & [[Steve Tasker]]\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2013092212/2013/REG3/jaguars@seahawks#tab=analyze&analyze=playbyplay Gamecenter], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/55882/SEA_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* SEA \u2013 [[Zach Miller (tight end, born 1985)|Zach Miller]] 1-yard pass from [[Russell Wilson]] ([[Steven Hauschka]] kick), 8:04 (SEA&nbsp;7\u20130)\n'''Second quarter'''\n* SEA \u2013 Zach Miller 4-yard pass from Russell Wilson (Steven Hauschka kick), 14:26 (SEA&nbsp;14\u20130)\n* SEA \u2013 Steven Hauschka 21-yard field goal, 9:40 (SEA&nbsp;17\u20130)\n* SEA \u2013 [[Sidney Rice]] 11-yard pass from Russell Wilson (Steven Hauschka kick), 0:10 (SEA&nbsp;24\u20130)\n'''Third quarter'''\n* SEA \u2013 Sidney Rice 23-yard pass from Russell Wilson (Steven Hauschka kick), 11:41 (SEA&nbsp;31\u20130)\n* JAX \u2013 [[Maurice Jones-Drew]] 2-yard run ([[Josh Scobee]] kick), 6:20 (SEA&nbsp;31\u20137)\n* SEA \u2013 [[Doug Baldwin]] 35-yard pass from [[Tarvaris Jackson]] (Steven Hauschka kick), 1:28 (SEA&nbsp;38\u20137)\n* JAX \u2013 Josh Scobee 33-yard field goal, 0:06 (SEA&nbsp;38\u201310)\n'''Fourth quarter'''\n* JAX \u2013 [[Jordan Todman]] 3-yard run (Josh Scobee kick), 9:06 (SEA&nbsp;38\u201317)\n* SEA \u2013 Tarvaris Jackson 5-yard run (Steven Hauschka kick), 6:32 (SEA&nbsp;45\u201317)\n |stats=\n'''Top passers'''\n* JAX \u2013 [[Chad Henne]]: 18/38, 235 yds, 2 INT\n* SEA \u2013 [[Russell Wilson]]: 14/21, 202 yds, 4 TD, 1 INT\n'''Top rushers'''\n* JAX \u2013 [[Maurice Jones-Drew]]: 19 car, 43 yds, 1 TD\n* SEA \u2013 [[Marshawn Lynch]]: 17 car, 69 yds\n'''Top receivers'''\n* JAX \u2013 [[Cecil Shorts III]]: 8 rec, 143 yds\n* SEA \u2013 [[Golden Tate]]: 5 rec, 88 yds\n'''Top tacklers'''\n* JAX \u2013 [[Paul Posluszny]]: 5 solo, 7 asst, {{tooltip|tfl|tackle for loss}}, {{tooltip|INT|interception}}, {{tooltip|pd|pass defended}}\n* SEA \u2013 [[Bobby Wagner]]: 3 solo, 6 asst, {{tooltip|tfl|tackle for loss}}, {{tooltip|INT|interception}}, {{tooltip|pd|pass defended}}\n'''Team''' \u2013 {{tooltip|pass|passing yards}} \u2013 {{tooltip|rush|rushing yards}} \u2013 {{tooltip|total|total yards}} \u2013 {{tooltip|to|turnovers}}\n* JAX \u2013 214 \u2013 51 \u2013 265 \u2013 3\n* SEA \u2013 323 \u2013 156 \u2013 479 \u2013 2\n}}\nThe Seahawks entered week 3 on top of the NFC to take on the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] who were on the opposite end of the AFC. This game did not garner much attention, considering the fact that it was a \"best vs worst\" game. However, that didn't change Seattle's positive \"1\u20130\" mentality to the game.\n\nSeattle opened up the game with a punt. After forcing a Jacksonville three and out, on a drive which included a [[Clinton McDonald]] sack, [[Russell Wilson]] marched the Seahawks right down the field, on a drive that included a 27-yard run by [[Marshawn Lynch]], and on third and goal from the 1-yard line, hit tight end [[Zach Miller (tight end, born 1985)|Zach Miller]] for a touchdown, and an early 7\u20130 lead.\n\nPicking up from where they left off in the first quarter, Seattle took their first drive of the second quarter, where Wilson connected with Miller for a 4-yard touchdown pass, the duo's second of the day. After a [[Steven Hauschka]] 21-yard field goal on the next drive, the game got quiet until the Jaguars final drive of the half, where [[Chad Henne]] was intercepted by linebacker [[Bobby Wagner]], with under a minute left to play. Wilson then made some beautiful completions to receivers [[Golden Tate]] and [[Sidney Rice]] in lightning fast succession, the latter of whom caught an 11-yard pass for a touchdown with 10 seconds left on the clock, to send Seattle up 24\u20130 at the half.\n\nOn the Seahawks first drive of the second half, they picked up were they left off, as Wilson hit rice for a 23-yard score, marking Wilson's fourth TD pass of the day, tying a career-high, and putting the Hawks up 31\u20130. On the ensuing drive, however, Wilson was picked off by linebacker [[Paul Posluszny]], who returned it to the Seattle 2-yard line, where Jaguars RB [[Maurice Jones-Drew]] punched it in on the next play, 31\u20137 Seattle. That was the last time Wilson touched the ball. Backup [[Tarvaris Jackson]] took over and drove Seattle to the Jaguars 35-yard line, not missing a single completion on the drive.

After another Indy three-and-out, Russell Wilson threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Golden Tate to take a 10-0 lead. Then another Indy punt was blocked and bounced out of the endzone to extend the lead to 12-0. Seattle punted to Indy when Andrew Luck threw a 73-yard touchdown to T.Y. Hilton to make the score 12-7. Seattle drove into field goal range but a 48-yard field goal was blocked and returned for a touchdown by the Colts. Indy led 14-12 until Wilson found Jermaine Kearse to give Seattle a 19-14 lead. Luck led the Colts downfield and they kicked a field goal to make it 19-17 at the half. Seattle kicked another field goal to make it 22-17. Indianapolis fumbled and led to a 25-17 Seahawks lead. Luck then found Hilton in the endzone but the two-point-conversion failed leaving  the score at 25-23. Seattle then kicked a 4th field goal to extend their lead to 28-23.

The Seahawks allowed a field goal from Titans kicker [[Rob Bironas]], but a second quarter touchdown from running back [[Marshawn Lynch]] caused the Seahawks to retake the lead. The Seahawks attempted to extend their lead at the end of the quarter with a [[field goal]]. With usual holder [[Jon Ryan]] in the locker room with a potential injury, reserve safety [[Chris Maragos]] was asked to hold the ball for the field goal attempt. Maragos however fumbled the snap, which was recovered by Titans special teamer [[Jason McCourty]] and run back 77 yards for a touchdown. The Seahawks then entered halftime behind 7-10.\n\nDuring the 3rd quarter, the Seahawks held the Titans scoreless while scoring a field goal of their own, tying the game. An additional field goal during the 4th put the Seahawks ahead again. On the first play of the next drive, Fitzpatrick threw an interception to Seahawks cornerback [[Richard Sherman (American football)|Richard Sherman]].

After holding the Rams to a field goal in the first quarter, the Seahawks went ahead with a 2-yard touchdown pass to [[Golden Tate]].\n\nThe Rams responded in the third quarter with another field goal, cutting down the Seahawks' lead to 1.

Carroll chastised Tate after the penalty occurred, and Tate was fined $7,875 after the game.\n\nAfter the Seahawks allowed an additional Rams field goal, the game came down to the final drive. The Rams, in possession of the ball with 5:42 left in the game, managed to drive the ball all the way to the 6 yard line with less than 1:20 left on the clock.

kicked off their 2013 campaign with a hard-fought, ugly win over the Carolina Panthers, 12\u20137. This game marked Russell Wilson's first 300-yard passing game, and Cam Newton's worst career performance, posting 125 yards through the air, a career low.\n\nThe first quarter ended equal for both teams, as both sides exchanged a couple of punts. Seattle took their third drive of the game in the second quarter, and drove into the red zone, capping it with a [[Steven Hauschka]] 27-yard field goal. Carolina responded immediately, and taking advantage of a couple of Seattle penalties, and some big runs by [[DeAngelo Williams]], with [[Cam Newton]] hitting [[Steve Smith (wide receiver, born 1979)|Steve Smith]] for a 3-yard TD. Seattle responded with a drive to around the Carolina 27 yard line, but [[Charles Godfrey (American football)|Charles Godfrey]] sacked [[Russell Wilson]] and stripped the football, which Carolina recovered. So the first half ended 7\u20133, Carolina.\n\nThe second half began with a defensive battle between both sides. Seattle then broke the deadlock with a [[Steven Hauschka]] 40-yard field goal, on a drive that lasted over 4 minutes, cutting the lead to 7\u20136. After forcing Carolina to punt midway through the fourth quarter, Seattle's offense produced its finest drive of the day. A couple of [[Russell Wilson]] passes, followed by a [[Robert Turbin]] 15-yard scamper, set up Seattle at the Panthers' 43 yard line. [[Russell Wilson]] overthrew receiver Stephen Williams on first down, but on second down and 10, by using exactly the same play, Wilson connected with second-year man [[Jermaine Kearse]] for a 43-yard score, with 10 minutes left to play. They failed the two-point conversion however, so Seattle had a 12\u20137 lead. Carolina responded by using [[DeAngelo Williams]] on some big runs. Inside the Seattle 35 yard line, Williams took off for a 24-yard scamper, and looked like he was going to score, however at the last possible moment, [[Earl Thomas (defensive back)|Earl Thomas]] forced Williams to fumble inside the 10 yard line.\n\n====Week 2: vs. San Francisco 49ers====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|Seattle Seahawks|year=2013|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Two: San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n |date=September 15\n |time=5:31 p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|local]]\n |road=49ers\n |R1=0|R2=0|R3=3|R4=0\n |home='''Seahawks'''\n |H1=0|H2=5|H3=7|H4=17\n |stadium=[[CenturyLink Field]], [[Seattle]]\n |attendance=68,338\n |weather=cloudy, {{convert|64|F|C}}, 81% humidity, wind SSW {{convert|6|mph|km/h}}\n |referee=[[John Parry (American football official)|John Parry]]\n |TV=[[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Al Michaels]], [[Cris Collinsworth]] & [[Michele Tafoya]]\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2013091513/2013/REG2/49ers@seahawks#tab=analyze&analyze=playbyplay Gamecenter], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/55867/SEA_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*No scoring plays\n'''Second quarter'''\n* SEA \u2013 [[Safety (gridiron football score)|Safety]], San Francisco holding in end zone, 10:39 (SEA&nbsp;2\u20130)\n* SEA \u2013 [[Steven Hauschka]] 30-yard field goal, 5:52 (SEA&nbsp;5\u20130)\n'''Third quarter'''\n* SEA \u2013 [[Marshawn Lynch]] 14-yard run (Steven Hauschka kick), 9:12 (SEA&nbsp;12\u20130)\n* SF \u2013 [[Phil Dawson]] 21-yard field goal, 4:20 (SEA&nbsp;12\u20133)\n'''Fourth quarter'''\n* SEA \u2013 Marshawn Lynch 7-yard pass from [[Russell Wilson]] (Steven Hauschka kick), 13:44 (SEA&nbsp;19\u20133)\n* SEA \u2013 Steven Hauschka 37-yard field goal, 11:31 (SEA&nbsp;22\u20133)\n* SEA \u2013 [[Marshawn Lynch]] 2-yard run (Steven Hauschka kick), 4:22 (SEA&nbsp;29\u20133)\n |stats=\n'''Top passers'''\n* SF \u2013 [[Colin Kaepernick]]: 13/28, 127 yds, 3 INT\n* SEA \u2013 [[Russell Wilson]]: 8/19, 142 yds, 1 TD, 1 INT\n'''Top rushers'''\n* SF \u2013 Colin Kaepernick: 9 car, 87 yds\n* SEA \u2013 [[Marshawn Lynch]]: 28 car, 98 yds, 2 TD\n'''Top receivers'''\n* SF \u2013 [[Kyle Williams (wide receiver)|Kyle Williams]]: 4 rec, 39 yds\n* SEA \u2013 [[Doug Baldwin]]: 1 rec, 51 yds\n'''Top tacklers'''\n* SF \u2013 [[NaVorro Bowman]]: 4 solo, 7 asst\n* SEA \u2013 [[Bobby Wagner]]: 2 solo, 5 asst, {{tooltip|pd|pass defended}}\n'''Team''' \u2013 {{tooltip|pass|passing yards}} \u2013 {{tooltip|rush|rushing yards}} \u2013 {{tooltip|total|total yards}} \u2013 {{tooltip|to|turnovers}}\n* SF \u2013 107 \u2013 100 \u2013 207 \u2013 5\n* SEA \u2013 118 \u2013 172 \u2013 290 \u2013 1\n}}\nIn week 2, the Seahawks took on their division rivals, the San Francisco 49ers. Prior to the season, NFL analysts{{Who|date=January 2014}} rated this rivalry as the top upcoming rivalry, as well as the top rivalry of the decade. Both teams proved that point, when they had an arms race in the off-season, Seattle picking up [[Percy Harvin]] and San Francisco picking [[Anquan Boldin]] in the off-season, among others. Last season, the teams were 1\u20131 against each other, Seattle being the better team, as they blew out the Niners 42\u201313 in the last meeting in Seattle, coincidentally, also on Sunday Night Football. It was also a day that [[Russell Wilson]] and [[Colin Kaepernick]] appeared to bet an eyebrow, with the loser shaving his eyebrow; this was later revealed to be a publicity stunt.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/09/wilson-kaepernick-eyebrow-bet-reaches-anticlimactic-conclusion/ | work=USA Today | title=Russell Wilson and Colin Kaepernick's eyebrow bet reaches dull conclusion}}</ref> Finally, it was a day where former Seahawk [[Shaun Alexander]] would raise the 12th man flag.\n\nThe game began quietly though, as both sides failed to establish a rhythm. The game was delayed midway through the first quarter due to lightning in the vicinity of the stadium, the second such case in the 2013 season (Ravens-Broncos kickoff game in week 1 was the first). After getting back onto the field, the 49ers blocked a Seahawks punt and got the ball in Seattle territory. However, Seattle claimed a whistle was heard from the crowd, which confused the linemen and the punter. That claim was later justified by NBC analyst [[Cris Collinsworth]]. The Niners took advantage and drove to the Seattle 10-yard line. However, on third down, [[Earl Thomas (defensive back)|Earl Thomas]] intercepted a [[Colin Kaepernick]] pass, and Seattle regained possession. A few plays later, [[Russell Wilson]] was intercepted by rookie [[Eric Reid (American football)|Eric Reid]], and the tug of war continued into the second quarter.\n\nAll was quiet until midway through the second quarter, where fullback [[Bruce Miller (American football)|Bruce Miller]] was caught holding in the endzone, the result of which was a safety, and a Seattle 2\u20130 lead. Later on, defensive end [[Cliff Avril]] strip sacked Kaepernick and [[K. J. Wright]] recovered for Seattle, the result of which was a [[Steven Hauschka]] 30-yard field goal. Halftime came with a small 5\u20130 Seahawks lead. The game was pretty dark and messy at that point, the only bright side being Seattle running back [[Marshawn Lynch]].\n\nIn the third quarter, the Seahawks came out roaring. On third and 12, Wilson connected with receiver [[Doug Baldwin]] for a 51-yard gain to inside the 49ers 25 yard line. A few plays later, Lynch took it to the house on a 14-yard run, 12\u20130 Seattle. The 49ers responded with a drive to the Seattle 6-yard line, capped of by [[Phil Dawson]] 21-yard field goal, that included a 28-yard scramble by Kaepernick, 12\u20133 Seahawks. However, that would be it for the Niners, and the third quarter.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the Seahawks demolished the Niners on all phases of play. It started with Wilson hitting Lynch for a 7-yard score on third down. A few plays into the Niners next drive, Kaepernick was intercepted by [[Richard Sherman (American football)|Richard Sherman]], who took it to the 49ers 25-yard line. That resulted in a 37-yard [[Steven Hauschka]] field goal. On the ensuing Niners drive, Kaepernick was intercepted again, this time by safety [[Kam Chancellor]], who had signed a contract extension earlier in the year. Lynch scored on a 2-yard run on the next play. Seattle led 29\u20133. The 49ers fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Seattle recovered.\n\nSeattle won, in convincing style, silencing any critics. The 12th man also broke a Guinness world record, for the loudest outdoor stadium. Yet again, Seattle dominated on SNF, and [[Pete Carroll]] improved to 3\u20134 overall against the Niners, and 2\u20133 against bitter rival [[Jim Harbaugh]]. Seattle was now 2\u20130, and still unbeaten at home.\n\n====Week 3: vs. Jacksonville Jaguars====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|Seattle Seahawks|year=2013|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title=Week Three: Jacksonville Jaguars at Seattle Seahawks&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n |date=September 22\n |time=1:26 p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|local]]\n |road=Jaguars\n |R1=0|R2=0|R3=10|R4=7\n |home='''Seahawks'''\n |H1=7|H2=17|H3=14|H4=7\n |stadium=[[CenturyLink Field]], [[Seattle]]\n |attendance=68,087\n |weather=rain, {{convert|61|F|C}}, 87% humidity, wind S {{convert|17|mph|km/h}}\n |referee=[[Bill Vinovich]]\n |TV=[[NFL on CBS|CBS]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Bill Macatee]] & [[Steve Tasker]]\n |reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2013092212/2013/REG3/jaguars@seahawks#tab=analyze&analyze=playbyplay Gamecenter], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/55882/SEA_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* SEA \u2013 [[Zach Miller (tight end, born 1985)|Zach Miller]] 1-yard pass from [[Russell Wilson]] ([[Steven Hauschka]] kick), 8:04 (SEA&nbsp;7\u20130)\n'''Second quarter'''\n* SEA \u2013 Zach Miller 4-yard pass from Russell Wilson (Steven Hauschka kick), 14:26 (SEA&nbsp;14\u20130)\n* SEA \u2013 Steven Hauschka 21-yard field goal, 9:40 (SEA&nbsp;17\u20130)\n* SEA \u2013 [[Sidney Rice]] 11-yard pass from Russell Wilson (Steven Hauschka kick), 0:10 (SEA&nbsp;24\u20130)\n'''Third quarter'''\n* SEA \u2013 Sidney Rice 23-yard pass from Russell Wilson (Steven Hauschka kick), 11:41 (SEA&nbsp;31\u20130)\n* JAX \u2013 [[Maurice Jones-Drew]] 2-yard run ([[Josh Scobee]] kick), 6:20 (SEA&nbsp;31\u20137)\n* SEA \u2013 [[Doug Baldwin]] 35-yard pass from [[Tarvaris Jackson]] (Steven Hauschka kick), 1:28 (SEA&nbsp;38\u20137)\n* JAX \u2013 Josh Scobee 33-yard field goal, 0:06 (SEA&nbsp;38\u201310)\n'''Fourth quarter'''\n* JAX \u2013 [[Jordan Todman]] 3-yard run (Josh Scobee kick), 9:06 (SEA&nbsp;38\u201317)\n* SEA \u2013 Tarvaris Jackson 5-yard run (Steven Hauschka kick), 6:32 (SEA&nbsp;45\u201317)\n |stats=\n'''Top passers'''\n* JAX \u2013 [[Chad Henne]]: 18/38, 235 yds, 2 INT\n* SEA \u2013 [[Russell Wilson]]: 14/21, 202 yds, 4 TD, 1 INT\n'''Top rushers'''\n* JAX \u2013 [[Maurice Jones-Drew]]: 19 car, 43 yds, 1 TD\n* SEA \u2013 [[Marshawn Lynch]]: 17 car, 69 yds\n'''Top receivers'''\n* JAX \u2013 [[Cecil Shorts III]]: 8 rec, 143 yds\n* SEA \u2013 [[Golden Tate]]: 5 rec, 88 yds\n'''Top tacklers'''\n* JAX \u2013 [[Paul Posluszny]]: 5 solo, 7 asst, {{tooltip|tfl|tackle for loss}}, {{tooltip|INT|interception}}, {{tooltip|pd|pass defended}}\n* SEA \u2013 [[Bobby Wagner]]: 3 solo, 6 asst, {{tooltip|tfl|tackle for loss}}, {{tooltip|INT|interception}}, {{tooltip|pd|pass defended}}\n'''Team''' \u2013 {{tooltip|pass|passing yards}} \u2013 {{tooltip|rush|rushing yards}} \u2013 {{tooltip|total|total yards}} \u2013 {{tooltip|to|turnovers}}\n* JAX \u2013 214 \u2013 51 \u2013 265 \u2013 3\n* SEA \u2013 323 \u2013 156 \u2013 479 \u2013 2\n}}\nThe Seahawks entered week 3 on top of the NFC to take on the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] who were on the opposite end of the AFC. This game did not garner much attention, considering the fact that it was a \"best vs worst\" game. However, that didn't change Seattle's positive \"1\u20130\" mentality to the game.\n\nSeattle opened up the game with a punt. After forcing a Jacksonville three and out, on a drive which included a [[Clinton McDonald]] sack, [[Russell Wilson]] marched the Seahawks right down the field, on a drive that included a 27-yard run by [[Marshawn Lynch]], and on third and goal from the 1-yard line, hit tight end [[Zach Miller (tight end, born 1985)|Zach Miller]] for a touchdown, and an early 7\u20130 lead.\n\nPicking up from where they left off in the first quarter, Seattle took their first drive of the second quarter, where Wilson connected with Miller for a 4-yard touchdown pass, the duo's second of the day. After a [[Steven Hauschka]] 21-yard field goal on the next drive, the game got quiet until the Jaguars final drive of the half, where [[Chad Henne]] was intercepted by linebacker [[Bobby Wagner]], with under a minute left to play. Wilson then made some beautiful completions to receivers [[Golden Tate]] and [[Sidney Rice]] in lightning fast succession, the latter of whom caught an 11-yard pass for a touchdown with 10 seconds left on the clock, to send Seattle up 24\u20130 at the half.\n\nOn the Seahawks first drive of the second half, they picked up were they left off, as Wilson hit rice for a 23-yard score, marking Wilson's fourth TD pass of the day, tying a career-high, and putting the Hawks up 31\u20130. On the ensuing drive, however, Wilson was picked off by linebacker [[Paul Posluszny]], who returned it to the Seattle 2-yard line, where Jaguars RB [[Maurice Jones-Drew]] punched it in on the next play, 31\u20137 Seattle. That was the last time Wilson touched the ball. Backup [[Tarvaris Jackson]] took over and drove Seattle to the Jaguars 35-yard line, not missing a single completion on the drive.

After another Indy three-and-out, Russell Wilson threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Golden Tate to take a 10-0 lead. Then another Indy punt was blocked and bounced out of the endzone to extend the lead to 12-0. Seattle punted to Indy when Andrew Luck threw a 73-yard touchdown to T.Y. Hilton to make the score 12-7. Seattle drove into field goal range but a 48-yard field goal was blocked and returned for a touchdown by the Colts. Indy led 14-12 until Wilson found Jermaine Kearse to give Seattle a 19-14 lead. Luck led the Colts downfield and they kicked a field goal to make it 19-17 at the half. Seattle kicked another field goal to make it 22-17. Indianapolis fumbled and led to a 25-17 Seahawks lead. Luck then found Hilton in the endzone but the two-point-conversion failed leaving  the score at 25-23. Seattle then kicked a 4th field goal to extend their lead to 28-23.

The Seahawks allowed a field goal from Titans kicker [[Rob Bironas]], but a second quarter touchdown from running back [[Marshawn Lynch]] caused the Seahawks to retake the lead. The Seahawks attempted to extend their lead at the end of the quarter with a [[field goal]]. With usual holder [[Jon Ryan]] in the locker room with a potential injury, reserve safety [[Chris Maragos]] was asked to hold the ball for the field goal attempt. Maragos however fumbled the snap, which was recovered by Titans special teamer [[Jason McCourty]] and run back 77 yards for a touchdown. The Seahawks then entered halftime behind 7-10.\n\nDuring the 3rd quarter, the Seahawks held the Titans scoreless while scoring a field goal of their own, tying the game. An additional field goal during the 4th put the Seahawks ahead again. On the first play of the next drive, Fitzpatrick threw an interception to Seahawks cornerback [[Richard Sherman (American football)|Richard Sherman]].

After holding the Rams to a field goal in the first quarter, the Seahawks went ahead with a 2-yard touchdown pass to [[Golden Tate]].\n\nThe Rams responded in the third quarter with another field goal, cutting down the Seahawks' lead to 1.

Carroll chastised Tate after the penalty occurred, and Tate was fined $7,875 after the game.\n\nAfter the Seahawks allowed an additional Rams field goal, the game came down to the final drive. The Rams, in possession of the ball with 5:42 left in the game, managed to drive the ball all the way to the 6 yard line with less than 1:20 left on the clock.

His design influenced by [[Himura Kenshin]] from [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]]'s manga ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' when deciding how andrognynous the character should look. In the anime series, Tanjiro is voiced by [[Natsuki Hanae]] in Japanese and Zach Aguilar in English. The character has been well received by manga and anime critics due to his caring nature and relationship with his sister while also becoming a strong fighter. This has led to the character winning multiple awards based on his popularity with Hanae's performance as him also receiving one.\n\n==Creation and design==\n[[File:NezukoTanjiroearlysketch.jpg|thumb|left|Early sketches of Nezuko and Tanjiro]]\nTanjiro Kamado originates from Koyoharu Got\u014dge's ideas involving a one-shot with Japanese motifs. Tatsuhiko Katayama, his editor, was worried about the one-shot being too dark for the young demographic and asked Got\u014dge if he could write another type of main character who would be \"brighter\".<ref name=\"creation\">{{cite web|url=https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/web_pages/234/|title=The birth of \"Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba\"|publisher=Shueisha|website=Manga Plus|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> Got\u014dge has cited issues in the making of the character due to the contrast he has with the dark narrative. For the release of the manga's seventh chapter, Got\u014dge drew a cover of Tanjiro wielding his sword while smiling. However, due to the constrating aesthetics the manga had. As a result, Got\u014dge discarded the drawing and instead drew a similar design with Tanjiro having a serious expression.<ref>{{cite book|title=Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba|volume=2|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-9747-0053-0|year=2018|author=Got\u014dge, Koyoharu}}</ref>\n\nIn the initial design, Tanjiro did not have a scar or wear earrings, but in the end they felt these features really accentuated the character. In the making of the cast, Tanjiro had four supporting characters who would balance each other due to their different skills. The editor commented about Tanjiro, \"[He] is a type of male main character that you don't really see much. He's so kind. He has Nezuko, so he's coming from this position where he can't just say all demons are absolute evil. He's in the gray zone.\" Tanjiro's design was also influenced by Got\u014dge's editor: He suggested giving Tanjiro a facial scar in his forehead inspired by [[Himura Kenshin]] from [[Nobuhiro Watsuki]]'s manga ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' while also giving him earrings in order to balance how androgynous he would look.<ref name=\"creation\"/>\n\nYuma Takahashi, the producer behind the adaptation of the manga said he enjoyed Tanjiro's role in the manga, making him engaged in reading the series. For how Tanjiro's Water Breathing was portrayed, [[Ufotable]] received inspiration from [[Katsushika Hokusai]]'s [[ukiyo-e]] style. The first fight scene between Tanjiro and Giyu was also carefully animated to give viewers an appealing choreography.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/es-es/anime-feature/2019/08/16/yuma-takahashi-talks-about-producing-one-of-animes-biggest-hits?referrer=community_cr_twitter_news|title=Yuma Takahashi Talks About Producing One of Anime's Biggest Hits!|publisher=Crunchyroll|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref> Tanjiro's water-based techniques were created using a mix between hand-drawn animation and CGI, while his battle against Rui was one of the most worked scenes in the making.

Hanae noted that multiple response to his career involved him portraying sad characters. However, in Tanjiro's case, he said Tanjiro is on the easy side because he says what he thinks, and is not the type that thinks one way and other things. Nezuko's actress, [[Akari Kit\u014d]], said Hanae is like a big brother to her at the studio, supportive and if there are parts she has difficulty recording, Hanae would stay and wait till she finishes even though his part has finished. Hanae said she also thinks of Kit\u014d as a younger sister. He also says it is easier for him to do his best when he is around people who he is friendly with.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://natalie.mu/comic/pp/kimetsu|title=\u300c\u9b3c\u6ec5\u306e\u5203\u300d\u3068\u306f\uff1f|publisher=Ntalie|accessdate=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nEnglish voice actor Zach Aguilar was overjoyed when being given the role of voicing Tanjiro in the dub due to him being a fan of the series, as well as noting he was supported by multiple fans.<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Zach Aguilar|user=airzach\n|number=1182014282487042048 |date=October 9, 2019 |title=Incredibly honored by this - I\u2019m voicing Tanjiro for the English dub of Demon Slayer!

His endless optimism and simple nature often has people enjoy his company, but at the same time, it also puts him at odds with certain personalities. Tanjiro has a heightened sense of smell which allows him to track down demons and evade their attacks.

Hanae noted that multiple response to his career involved him portraying sad characters. However, in Tanjiro's case, he said Tanjiro is on the easy side because he says what he thinks, and is not the type that thinks one way and other things. Nezuko's actress, [[Akari Kit\u014d]], said Hanae is like a big brother to her at the studio, supportive and if there are parts she has difficulty recording, Hanae would stay and wait till she finishes even though his part has finished. Hanae said she also thinks of Kit\u014d as a younger sister.

Newer archaeological evidence shows the presence of a people who lived in an area called Gungywump, somewhat northwest of the Mystic River, which suggests that the Pequots may have been indigenous to southeastern Connecticut prior to the 16th century. (Leigh Fought, 2007. ''A History of Mystic, Connecticut: From Pequot Village to Tourist Town'' p. 13).</ref> They were in control of a considerable amount of territory, extending toward the [[Pawcatuck River]] to the east and the [[Connecticut River]] to the west.\n\nTo the northwest, the Five Nations of the [[Iroquois]] dominated the land linked by the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Hudson River]], allowing trading to occur between the Iroquois and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]].  The Pequots were settled just distant enough to be secure from any danger that the Iroquois posed.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\">Leigh Fought, ''A History of Mystic Connecticut: From Pequot Village to Tourist Town''. Charleston, North Carolina: www.historypress.net, 2007.</ref> The [[Pequot War]] profoundly affected the Mystic area between 1636 and 1638. In May 1637, captains John Underhill and John Mason led a mission through Narragansett land, along with their allies the Narragansetts and Mohegans, and struck the Pequot Indian settlement in Mystic in the event which came to be known as the [[Mystic massacre]].<ref name=\"accessed October 12, 2008\">The Pequot War. {{cite web |url=http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315215644/http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |archivedate=2007-03-15 }} (accessed October 12, 2008).</ref> On September 21, 1638, the colonists signed the [[Treaty of Hartford (1638)|Treaty of Hartford]], officially ending the Pequot War.<ref name=\"accessed November 11, 2008\">[http://www.colonialwarsct.org/1637.htm \"1637 \u2013 The Pequot War\"] (2007). The Society of Colonial War in the State of Connecticut.  Accessed November 11, 2008.</ref>\n\n===English settlement===\nAs a result of the Pequot War, Pequot control of the Mystic area ended and English settlements increased in the area. By the 1640s, Connecticut Colony began to grant land to the Pequot War veterans. [[John Winthrop the Younger]], the son of the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was among those to receive property, much of which was in southeastern Connecticut. Other early settlers in the Mystic area included Robert Burrows and George Denison, who held land in the Mystic River Valley.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\">''Mystic: An American Journey''. Mystic: Mystic River Historical Society, 2004.</ref>\n\nSettlement grew slowly. The [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut government]] and Massachusetts Bay government began to quarrel over boundaries, thus causing some conflicting claims concerning governmental authority between the Mystic River and the [[Pawcatuck River]]. In the 1640s and 1650s, \"Connecticut\" referred to settlements located along the Connecticut River, as well as its claims in other parts of the region.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\">Mystic River Historical Society. ''Images of America: Mystic''. Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Arcadia Publishing, 2004.</ref>  Massachusetts Bay, however, claimed to have authority over Stonington and even into Rhode Island.\n\nConnecticut did not have a royal charter that separated it from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; the Connecticut General Court was formed by leaders of the settlements. The General Court claimed rule of the area by right of conquest, but the Massachusetts Bay Colony saw matters differently. The Bay Colony had contributed to the war by sending a militia under captains John Underhill and Thomas Stoughton, which they argued gave territorial rights and authority to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut Court.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\"/>\n\nWith conflicting views, both colonies turned to the [[New England Confederation|United Colonies of New England]] to resolve the dispute. The United Colonies of New England was formed in 1643, established to settle disputes such as this one. They voted to establish the boundary between the claims of the Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut at the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. As a result, Connecticut would be positioned west of the river, and Massachusetts Bay could have the land to the east, including the Mystic River.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThroughout the next decade, colonists were beginning to settle around the Mystic River. John Mason, one of the captains who led the colonists against the Pequots, had previously been granted {{convert|500|acre|km2|0}} on the eastern banks of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\">Mystic River Historical Society. http://mystichistory.org/about_mrhs.htm (accessed November 13, 2008).</ref>  He also received the island that now bears his name, though he never lived on the property. In 1653, John Gallup, Jr. was given {{convert|300|acre|km2}} approximately midway up the east part of the Mystic River.\n\nWithin the same year, others joined John Gallup and began to settle around the Mystic River. George Denison, a veteran of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army, was given his own strip of {{convert|300|acre|km2}}, just south of Gallup's land in 1654.  Thomas Miner had immigrated to Massachusetts with John Winthrop and was granted many land plots, the main one lying on Quiambaug Cove, just east of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\"/>  Other families granted land at their arrival were Reverend Robert Blinman, the Beebe brothers, Thomas Parke, and Connecticut Governor John Hayne.\n\nLike Captain John Mason, not all these men actually lived on their land. Many sold it to profit from or employed an overseer to cultivate their property. Many men, however, actually brought their wives and children, which indicated their plans on forming a community in the Mystic River Valley.\n\nThere was one recorded case of a woman who did not come to the Mystic River Valley as a wife. Widow Margaret Lake received a grant from the Massachusetts Bay authority and was the only woman to receive a land grant in her own name.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/> She also did not live on her land but hired other people to maintain it. She took up residence in what is now called Lakes Pond. Her daughter was married to John Gallup, while her sister was married to Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nBy 1675, settlement had grown tremendously in the Mystic River Valley, and infrastructure was beginning to appear as well as an economy. The Pequot Trail was used as a main highway to get around the Mystic River and played a vital role in the settlers' lives, allowing them to transport livestock, crops, furs, and other equipment to and from their farm lands. However, those families living on the east side of the Mystic River were unable to make any use of the Pequot Trail. As early as 1660, Robert Burrows was authorized to institute a ferry somewhere along the middle of the river's length. This earned his home the name of \"Half-way House\".<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nThe Pequot Trail also connected the settlers to their church. [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] residents found it difficult to attend church in Mystic or Groton, and this led to the creation of their own church. The town of Stonington was then established as separate from Mystic in regards to church attendance and was granted leave to build a church of their own. The building became known as the Road Church.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nColonists began public schools in this area around 1679, and John Fish became the first schoolmaster in Stonington, conducting classes and lessons in his home.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Education was a very important thing to the New England colonists, enabling boys, girls, African Americans, Indians, and servants to learn literacy skills. Most families throughout New England had six or more children in each household, giving Fish plenty of students.\n\nFish also gave lectures and insights about marriage and maintenance of a solid family. [[Divorce]] was very uncommon in those days; however, John Fish's wife ran off with Samuel Culver. In the case of a runaway spouse, the abandoned spouse was not allowed to file for divorce until six years had passed. This law ensured that the spouse was actually gone and not intending to come back.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Fish was eventually allowed to divorce in 1680, but this had no impact on his reputation as a school teacher, and parents continued to allow their children to attend his classes.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Mystic, Connecticut (circa 1901).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street (circa 1901)]]\nBy the first decade of the 18th century, three villages had begun to develop along the Mystic River. The largest village was called Mystic (now [[Old Mystic]]), also known as the Head of the River because it lay where several creeks united into the Mystic River estuary.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>  Two villages lay farther down the river. One was called Stonington and was considered to be Lower Mystic, consisting of twelve houses by the early 19th century. These twelve houses lay along Willow Street, which ended at the ferry landing. On the opposite bank of the river in the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] stood the village that became known as [[Portersville, Connecticut|Portersville]].<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThrough the 18th century, Mystic's economy was composed of [[manufacturing]], [[road building]], and [[seafaring|maritime trades]]. [[Agriculture]] was the main component of their economy, since most of the citizens were farmers.  In turn, the colonists provided their mother country with raw material resources that led to the emergence of a colonial manufacturing system. Land remained an essential source of wealth, though some land was very rocky and prevented early farmers from producing crops. This, however, did not necessarily lead to poverty. They grew corn, wheat, peas, potatoes, and a variety of fruits. They raised cattle, chicken, pigs, and sheep. They were hunters and fishermen and were generally able to sustain themselves. With an average household of about nine children, labor was easily provided in the fields.\n\n===National Register of Historic Places===\nMystic has three [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]]s: the [[Mystic Bridge Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 27, [[Rossie Velvet Mill Historic District]] between Pleasant Street and Bruggerman Place, and the [[Mystic River Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 215.

The village is on the east and west bank of the [[estuary]] of the [[Mystic River (Connecticut)|Mystic River]]. [[Mason's Island]] ([[Pequot language]]: ''Chippachaug'') fills the south end of the estuary. Most of the bedrock of Mystic is \"gneissic, crystalline terrane extending from eastern Massachusetts through western Rhode Island and across southeastern Connecticut north of Long Island Sound,\" according to geologist Richard Goldsmith.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://pubs.usgs.gov/imap/1524/report.pdf|title= BEDROCK GEOLOGIC MAP OF THE OLD MYSTIC AND PART OF THE MYSTIC QUADRANGLES|publisher= usgs.gov |accessdate=2017-05-25}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n| 1990= 2618\n| 2000= 4001\n| 2010= 4205}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 4,001 people, 1,797 households, and 995 families residing in the CDP.

Newer archaeological evidence shows the presence of a people who lived in an area called Gungywump, somewhat northwest of the Mystic River, which suggests that the Pequots may have been indigenous to southeastern Connecticut prior to the 16th century. (Leigh Fought, 2007. ''A History of Mystic, Connecticut: From Pequot Village to Tourist Town'' p. 13).</ref> lived in this portion of southeastern [[Connecticut]]. They were in control of a considerable amount of territory, extending toward the [[Pawcatuck River]] to the east and the [[Connecticut River]] to the west.\n\nTo the northwest, the Five Nations of the [[Iroquois]] dominated the land linked by the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Hudson River]], allowing trading to occur between the Iroquois and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]].  The Pequots were settled just distant enough to be secure from any danger that the Iroquois posed.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\">Leigh Fought, ''A History of Mystic Connecticut: From Pequot Village to Tourist Town''. Charleston, North Carolina: www.historypress.net, 2007.</ref> The [[Pequot War]] profoundly affected the Mystic area between 1636 and 1638. In May 1637, captains John Underhill and John Mason led a mission through Narragansett land, along with their allies the Narragansetts and Mohegans, and struck the Pequot Indian settlement in Mystic in the event which came to be known as the [[Mystic massacre]].<ref name=\"accessed October 12, 2008\">The Pequot War. {{cite web |url=http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315215644/http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |archivedate=2007-03-15 }} (accessed October 12, 2008).</ref> On September 21, 1638, the colonists signed the [[Treaty of Hartford (1638)|Treaty of Hartford]], officially ending the Pequot War.<ref name=\"accessed November 11, 2008\">[http://www.colonialwarsct.org/1637.htm \"1637 \u2013 The Pequot War\"] (2007). The Society of Colonial War in the State of Connecticut.  Accessed November 11, 2008.</ref>\n\n===English settlement===\nAs a result of the Pequot War, Pequot control of the Mystic area ended and English settlements increased in the area. By the 1640s, Connecticut Colony began to grant land to the Pequot War veterans. [[John Winthrop the Younger]], the son of the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was among those to receive property, much of which was in southeastern Connecticut. Other early settlers in the Mystic area included Robert Burrows and George Denison, who held land in the Mystic River Valley.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\">''Mystic: An American Journey''. Mystic: Mystic River Historical Society, 2004.</ref>\n\nSettlement grew slowly. The [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut government]] and Massachusetts Bay government began to quarrel over boundaries, thus causing some conflicting claims concerning governmental authority between the Mystic River and the [[Pawcatuck River]]. In the 1640s and 1650s, \"Connecticut\" referred to settlements located along the Connecticut River, as well as its claims in other parts of the region.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\">Mystic River Historical Society. ''Images of America: Mystic''. Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Arcadia Publishing, 2004.</ref>  Massachusetts Bay, however, claimed to have authority over Stonington and even into Rhode Island.\n\nConnecticut did not have a royal charter that separated it from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; the Connecticut General Court was formed by leaders of the settlements. The General Court claimed rule of the area by right of conquest, but the Massachusetts Bay Colony saw matters differently. The Bay Colony had contributed to the war by sending a militia under captains John Underhill and Thomas Stoughton, which they argued gave territorial rights and authority to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut Court.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\"/>\n\nWith conflicting views, both colonies turned to the [[New England Confederation|United Colonies of New England]] to resolve the dispute. The United Colonies of New England was formed in 1643, established to settle disputes such as this one. They voted to establish the boundary between the claims of the Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut at the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. As a result, Connecticut would be positioned west of the river, and Massachusetts Bay could have the land to the east, including the Mystic River.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThroughout the next decade, colonists were beginning to settle around the Mystic River. John Mason, one of the captains who led the colonists against the Pequots, had previously been granted {{convert|500|acre|km2|0}} on the eastern banks of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\">Mystic River Historical Society. http://mystichistory.org/about_mrhs.htm (accessed November 13, 2008).</ref>  He also received the island that now bears his name, though he never lived on the property. In 1653, John Gallup, Jr. was given {{convert|300|acre|km2}} approximately midway up the east part of the Mystic River.\n\nWithin the same year, others joined John Gallup and began to settle around the Mystic River. George Denison, a veteran of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army, was given his own strip of {{convert|300|acre|km2}}, just south of Gallup's land in 1654.  Thomas Miner had immigrated to Massachusetts with John Winthrop and was granted many land plots, the main one lying on Quiambaug Cove, just east of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\"/>  Other families granted land at their arrival were Reverend Robert Blinman, the Beebe brothers, Thomas Parke, and Connecticut Governor John Hayne.\n\nLike Captain John Mason, not all these men actually lived on their land. Many sold it to profit from or employed an overseer to cultivate their property. Many men, however, actually brought their wives and children, which indicated their plans on forming a community in the Mystic River Valley.\n\nThere was one recorded case of a woman who did not come to the Mystic River Valley as a wife. Widow Margaret Lake received a grant from the Massachusetts Bay authority and was the only woman to receive a land grant in her own name.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/> She also did not live on her land but hired other people to maintain it. She took up residence in what is now called Lakes Pond. Her daughter was married to John Gallup, while her sister was married to Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nBy 1675, settlement had grown tremendously in the Mystic River Valley, and infrastructure was beginning to appear as well as an economy. The Pequot Trail was used as a main highway to get around the Mystic River and played a vital role in the settlers' lives, allowing them to transport livestock, crops, furs, and other equipment to and from their farm lands. However, those families living on the east side of the Mystic River were unable to make any use of the Pequot Trail. As early as 1660, Robert Burrows was authorized to institute a ferry somewhere along the middle of the river's length. This earned his home the name of \"Half-way House\".<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nThe Pequot Trail also connected the settlers to their church. [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] residents found it difficult to attend church in Mystic or Groton, and this led to the creation of their own church. The town of Stonington was then established as separate from Mystic in regards to church attendance and was granted leave to build a church of their own. The building became known as the Road Church.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nColonists began public schools in this area around 1679, and John Fish became the first schoolmaster in Stonington, conducting classes and lessons in his home.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Education was a very important thing to the New England colonists, enabling boys, girls, African Americans, Indians, and servants to learn literacy skills. Most families throughout New England had six or more children in each household, giving Fish plenty of students.\n\nFish also gave lectures and insights about marriage and maintenance of a solid family. [[Divorce]] was very uncommon in those days; however, John Fish's wife ran off with Samuel Culver. In the case of a runaway spouse, the abandoned spouse was not allowed to file for divorce until six years had passed. This law ensured that the spouse was actually gone and not intending to come back.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Fish was eventually allowed to divorce in 1680, but this had no impact on his reputation as a school teacher, and parents continued to allow their children to attend his classes.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Mystic, Connecticut (circa 1901).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street (circa 1901)]]\nBy the first decade of the 18th century, three villages had begun to develop along the Mystic River. The largest village was called Mystic (now [[Old Mystic]]), also known as the Head of the River because it lay where several creeks united into the Mystic River estuary.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>  Two villages lay farther down the river. One was called Stonington and was considered to be Lower Mystic, consisting of twelve houses by the early 19th century. These twelve houses lay along Willow Street, which ended at the ferry landing. On the opposite bank of the river in the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] stood the village that became known as [[Portersville, Connecticut|Portersville]].<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThrough the 18th century, Mystic's economy was composed of [[manufacturing]], [[road building]], and [[seafaring|maritime trades]]. [[Agriculture]] was the main component of their economy, since most of the citizens were farmers.  In turn, the colonists provided their mother country with raw material resources that led to the emergence of a colonial manufacturing system. Land remained an essential source of wealth, though some land was very rocky and prevented early farmers from producing crops. This, however, did not necessarily lead to poverty. They grew corn, wheat, peas, potatoes, and a variety of fruits. They raised cattle, chicken, pigs, and sheep. They were hunters and fishermen and were generally able to sustain themselves. With an average household of about nine children, labor was easily provided in the fields.\n\n===National Register of Historic Places===\nMystic has three [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]]s: the [[Mystic Bridge Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 27, [[Rossie Velvet Mill Historic District]] between Pleasant Street and Bruggerman Place, and the [[Mystic River Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 215.

The village is on the east and west bank of the [[estuary]] of the [[Mystic River (Connecticut)|Mystic River]].

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor.

Their following episodes of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'' and ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]'' followed suit with plans to continue this format until further notice, which included hosting [[WrestleMania 36]] at this venue. AEW began this format with the March 18 episode of ''[[AEW Dynamite|Dynamite]]'', as well as that day's tapings for ''[[AEW Dark|Dark]]'', broadcasting from [[Daily's Place]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], though after a couple of weeks at this venue, they moved to an undisclosed location as Daily's Place became a testing site for COVID-19.

After the fall of Kush, the [[Nubians]] formed the three Christian kingdoms of [[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]], with the latter two lasting until around 1500. Between the 14th and 15th centuries much of Sudan was settled by [[Bedouin|Arab nomads]]. From the 16th\u201319th centuries, central and eastern Sudan were dominated by the [[Sultanate of Sennar|Funj sultanate]], while [[Sultanate of Darfur|Darfur]] ruled the west and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] the far north. This period saw extensive [[Islamisation]] and [[Arabisation]].\n\nFrom 1820 to 1874 the entirety of Sudan was conquered by the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]]. Between 1881 and 1885, the harsh Egyptian reign was eventually met with a successful [[Mahdist War|revolt]] led by the self-proclaimed [[Mahdi]] [[Muhammad Ahmad]], resulting in the establishment of the [[Mahdist Sudan|Caliphate of Omdurman]]. This state was eventually destroyed in 1898 by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]], who would then [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|govern Sudan together with Egypt]].\n\nThe 20th century saw the growth of Sudanese nationalism and in 1953 Britain granted Sudan self-government. Independence was proclaimed on 1 January 1956. Since independence, Sudan has been ruled by a series of unstable parliamentary governments and military regimes. Under [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], Sudan instituted [[Sharia|Islamic law]] in 1983.<ref name=\"sudan.gov.sd\">{{cite web |url=http://sudan.gov.sd/ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=39&Itemid=75 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902160838/http://sudan.gov.sd/ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=39&Itemid=75 |archive-date=2 September 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> This exacerbated the rift between the Islamic north, the seat of the government and the Animists and Christians in the [[South Sudan|south]]. Differences in language, religion, and political power erupted in a [[Second Sudanese Civil War|civil war]] between government forces, strongly influenced by the [[National Islamic Front]] (NIF), and the southern rebels, whose most influential faction was the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA), eventually concluding in the independence of South Sudan in 2011.<ref>Collins, Robert O.

It was established after the [[Bronze Age]] collapse and the disintegration of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], centered at Napata in its early phase.\n\nAfter King [[Kashta]] (\"the Kushite\") invaded Egypt in the eighth century BC, the Kushite kings ruled as pharaohs of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]] for a century before being defeated and driven out by the [[Assyria]]ns. At the height of their glory, the Kushites conquered an empire that stretched from what is now known as [[South Kordofan]] to the Sinai. Pharaoh [[Piye]] attempted to expand the empire into the Near East but was thwarted by the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]].\n\nThe Kingdom of Kush is mentioned in the Bible as having saved the Israelites from the wrath of the Assyrians, although disease among the besiegers was the main reason for the failure to take the city.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roux, Georges |title=Ancient Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klZX8B_RzzYC|date= 1992|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-193825-7}}</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2013}}\nThe war that took place between Pharaoh [[Taharqa]] and the Assyrian king [[Sennacherib]] was a decisive event in western history, with the Nubians being defeated in their attempts to gain a foothold in the [[Near East]] by Assyria. Sennacherib's successor [[Esarhaddon]] went further and invaded Egypt itself to secure his control of the Levant. This succeeded, as he managed to expel Taharqa from Lower Egypt. Taharqa fled back to Upper Egypt and Nubia, where he died two years later. Lower Egypt came under Assyrian vassalage but proved unruly, unsuccessfully rebelling against the Assyrians. Then, the king [[Tantamani]], a successor of Taharqa, made a final determined attempt to regain Lower Egypt from the newly re-instated Assyrian vassal [[Necho I]]. He managed to retake [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] killing Necho in the process and besieged cities in the Nile Delta. [[Ashurbanipal]], who had succeeded Esarhaddon,  sent a large army in Egypt to regain control. He routed Tantamani near Memphis and, pursuing him, [[Sack of Thebes|sacked Thebes]]. Although the Assyrians immediately departed Upper Egypt after these events, weakened, Thebes peacefully submitted itself to Necho's son [[Psamtik I]] less than a decade later. This ended all hopes of a revival of the Nubian Empire, which rather continued in the form of a smaller kingdom centered on [[Napata]]. The city was raided by the Egyptian c. 590 BC and the Kushite resettled in [[Mero\u00eb]].\n\nDuring Classical Antiquity, the Nubian capital was still at Mero\u00eb. In [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as [[Ethiopia]] (a term also used earlier by the Assyrians when encountering the Nubians). The civilization of Kush was among the first in the world to use iron smelting technology. The Nubian kingdom at Mero\u00eb persisted until the mid-fourth century AD.\n\n===Medieval Christian Nubian kingdoms (c. 350\u20131500)===\n{{main|Nobatia|Makuria|Alodia|Daju kingdom}} \n[[File:Christian Nubia.png|thumb|upright=0.9|The three Christian Nubian kingdoms.

Muhammad Ahmad died on 22 June 1885, a mere six months after the conquest of Khartoum. After a power struggle amongst his deputies, [[Abdallahi ibn Muhammad]], with the help primarily of the [[Baggara]] of western Sudan, overcame the opposition of the others and emerged as unchallenged leader of the Mahdiyah. After consolidating his power, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad assumed the title of ''Khalifa'' (successor) of the Mahdi, instituted an administration, and appointed [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]] (who were usually [[Baggara]]) as emirs over each of the several provinces.\n\n[[File:Battle of Omdurman-1.JPG|thumb|250px|The flight of the Khalifa after his defeat at the [[Battle of Omdurman]].]]\n\nRegional relations remained tense throughout much of the Mahdiyah period, largely because of the Khalifa's brutal methods to extend his rule throughout the country.

In March 1889, king [[Yohannes IV]] of Ethiopia marched on [[Metemma]]; however, after Yohannes fell in battle, the Ethiopian forces withdrew. Abd ar Rahman an Nujumi, the Khalifa's general, attempted an invasion of Egypt in 1889, but British-led Egyptian troops defeated the Ansar at Tushkah. The failure of the Egyptian invasion broke the spell of the Ansar's invincibility. The [[Belgium|Belgians]] prevented the Mahdi's men from conquering [[Equatoria]], and in 1893, the Italians repelled an Ansar attack at [[Agordat]] (in [[Eritrea]]) and forced the Ansar to withdraw from Ethiopia.\n\nIn the 1890s, the British sought to re-establish their control over Sudan, once more officially in the name of the Egyptian Khedive, but in actuality treating the country as a British colony. By the early 1890s, British, French and Belgian claims had converged at the [[Nile]] headwaters. Britain feared that the other powers would take advantage of Sudan's instability to acquire territory previously annexed to Egypt. Apart from these political considerations, Britain wanted to establish control over the Nile to safeguard a planned irrigation dam at [[Aswan]]. [[Herbert Kitchener]] led military campaigns against the [[Mahdist Sudan]] from 1896 to 1898. Kitchener's campaigns culminated in a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Omdurman]] on 2 September 1898.\n\n===Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (1899\u20131956)===\n{{Main|Anglo-Egyptian Sudan}}\n[[File:The war in the Soudan.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The [[Mahdist War]] was fought between a group of Muslim dervishes, called [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdists]], who had over-run much of Sudan, and the British forces.]]\n\nIn 1899, Britain and Egypt reached an agreement under which Sudan was run by a governor-general appointed by Egypt with British consent.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Humphries |first1=Christian |title=Oxford World Encyclopedia |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=0195218183 |page=[https://archive.org/details/worldencyclopedi00oxfo/page/644 644] |url=https://archive.org/details/worldencyclopedi00oxfo/page/644 }}</ref> In reality, Sudan was effectively administered as a [[Crown colony]]. The British were keen to reverse the process, started under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]], of uniting the [[Nile Valley]] under Egyptian leadership and sought to frustrate all efforts aimed at further uniting the two countries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nUnder the Delimitation, Sudan's border with Abyssinia was contested by raiding tribesmen trading slaves, breaching boundaries of the law.  In 1905 Local chieftain [[Sultan Yambio]] reluctant to the end gave up the struggle with British forces that had occupied the [[Kordofan]] region, finally ending the lawlessness. The continued British administration of Sudan fuelled an increasingly strident nationalist backlash, with Egyptian nationalist leaders determined to force Britain to recognise a single independent union of Egypt and Sudan. With a formal end to Ottoman rule in 1914, Sir [[Reginald Wingate]] was sent that December to occupy Sudan as the new Military Governor. [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]] was declared [[Sultan of Egypt and Sudan]], as was his brother and successor, [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]]. They continued upon their insistence of a single Egyptian-Sudanese state even when the [[Sultanate of Egypt]] was retitled as the [[Kingdom of Egypt|Kingdom of Egypt and Sudan]], but it was [[Saad Zaghloul]] who continued to be frustrated in the ambitions until his death in 1927.<ref>M. Daly, ''Empire on the Nile'', p.346.</ref> \n[[File:Anglo-Egyptian Sudan camel soldier of the British army.jpg|thumb|right|A camel soldier of the native forces of the British army, early 20th century.]]\n\nFrom 1924 until independence in 1956, the British had a policy of running Sudan as two essentially separate territories, the north and south. The [[Lee Stack|assassination of a Governor-General of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in Cairo]] was the causative factor; it brought demands of the newly elected [[Wafd Party|Wafd]] government from colonial forces. A permanent establishment of two battalions in Khartoum was renamed the [[Sudan Defence Force]] acting as under the government, replacing the former garrison of Egyptian army soldiers, saw action afterwards during the [[Abyssinia Crisis|Walwal Incident]].<ref>Morewood, ''The British of Egypt'', (Suffolk 2005), p.4</ref> The [[Wafdist]] parliamentary majority had rejected [[Abdel Khalek Sarwat Pasha|Sarwat Pasha]]'s accommodation plan with [[Austen Chamberlain]] in London; yet Cairo still needed the money. The Sudanese Government's revenue had reached a peak in 1928 at \u00a36.6 million, thereafter the Wafdist disruptions, and Italian borders incursions from Somaliland, London decided to reduce expenditure during the Great Depression. Cotton and gum exports were dwarfed by the necessity to import almost everything from Britain leading to a balance of payments deficit at Khartoum.<ref>Daly, pp.457\u201359</ref>\n\nIn July 1936 the Liberal Constitutional leader, Muhammed Mahmoud was persuaded to bring Wafd delegates to London to sign the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, \"the beginning of a new stage in Anglo-Egyptian relations\", wrote [[Anthony Eden]].<ref>Morewood, \n''The British Defence of Egypt 1935\u201340'', (Suffolk, 1940), p.94-5</ref> The British Army was allowed to return to Sudan to protect the Canal Zone. They were able to find training facilities, and the RAF was free to fly over Egyptian territory. It did not, however, resolve the problem of Sudan: the Sudanese Intelligentsia agitated for a return to metropolitan rule, conspiring with Germany's agents.<ref>[[Arthur Henderson]], 8 May 1936 quoted in Daly, ''Empire on the Nile'', p.348</ref>\n\nMussolini made it clear that he could not invade Abyssinia without first conquering Egypt and Sudan; they intended unification of Libya with Italian East Africa. The British Imperial General Staff prepared for military defence of the region, which was thin on the ground.<ref>Sir Miles Lampson quoted in a diary, 29 September 1938; Morewood, p.117</ref> The British ambassador blocked Italian attempts to secure a Non-Aggression Treaty with Egypt-Sudan. But Mahmoud was a supporter of the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]; the region was caught between the Empire's efforts to save the Jews, and moderate Arab calls to halt migration.<ref>Morewood, p.164-5</ref>\n\nThe Sudanese Government was directly involved militarily in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]]. Formed in 1925, the [[Sudan Defence Force]] played an active part in responding to incursions early in World War Two.  Italian troops occupied [[Kassala]] and other border areas from [[Italian East Africa|Italian Somaliland]] during 1940.  In 1942, the SDF also played a part in the invasion of the Italian colony by British and Commonwealth forces.  The last British [[governor-general]] was [[Robert George Howe]].\n\nThe [[Egyptian revolution of 1952]] finally heralded the beginning of the march towards Sudanese independence. Having abolished the monarchy in 1953, Egypt's new leaders, [[Mohammed Naguib]], whose mother was Sudanese, and later [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], believed the only way to end British domination in Sudan was for Egypt to officially abandon its claims of sovereignty. In addition Nasser knew it would be difficult for Egypt to govern an impoverished Sudan after its independence. The British on the other hand continued their political and financial support for the Mahdist successor, [[Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi]], whom it was believed would resist Egyptian pressure for Sudanese independence.  Rahman was capable of this, but his regime was plagued by political ineptitude, which garnered a colossal loss of support in northern and central Sudan. Both Egypt and Britain sensed a great instability fomenting, and thus opted to allow both Sudanese regions, north and south to have a free vote on whether they wished independence or a British withdrawal.\n\n===Independence (1956\u2013present)===\n{{Main|History of Sudan (1956\u201369)|History of Sudan (1969\u201385)|History of Sudan (1986\u2013present)}}\n{{Missing information|section|the history of Sudan between 1956 and 1969 and between 1977 and 1989|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:Sudan independence 2.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|Sudan's flag raised at independence ceremony on 1 January 1956 by the Prime Minister Ismail al-Azhari and in presence of opposition leader Mohamed Ahmed Almahjoub]] \nA polling process was carried out resulting in composition of a democratic parliament and [[Ismail al-Azhari]] was elected first Prime Minister and led the first modern Sudanese government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sudan-embassy.co.uk/en/content/blogcategory/28/37 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120035130/http://sudan-embassy.co.uk/en/content/blogcategory/28/37 |archivedate=20 November 2008 |title=Brief History of the Sudan |publisher=Sudan Embassy in London |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> On 1 January 1956, in a special ceremony held at the People's Palace, the Egyptian and British flags were lowered and the new Sudanese flag, composed of green, blue and yellow stripes, was raised in their place by the prime minister [[Ismail al-Azhari]].\n\nDissatisfaction culminated in a second [[1969 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] on 25 May 1969. The coup leader, Col. [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], became prime minister, and the new regime abolished parliament and outlawed all political parties. Disputes between [[Marxist]] and non-Marxist elements within the ruling military coalition resulted in [[1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat|a briefly successful coup in July 1971]], led by the [[Sudanese Communist Party]]. Several days later, anti-communist military elements restored Nimeiry to power.\n\nIn 1972, the [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]] led to a cessation of the north\u2013south civil war and a degree of self-rule. This led to ten years hiatus in the civil war but an end to American investment in the [[Jonglei Canal]] project.  This had been considered absolutely essential to irrigate the Upper Nile region and to prevent an environmental catastrophe and wide-scale famine among the local tribes, most especially the Dinka. In the civil war that followed their homeland was raided, looted, pillaged and burned.  Many of the tribe were murdered in a bloody civil war that raged for over 20 years.\n\n[[File:Hashem al Atta, 1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat.jpg|thumb|[[1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat]]]]\nUntil the early 1970s, Sudan's agricultural output was mostly dedicated to internal consumption. In 1972, the Sudanese government became more pro-Western, and made plans to export food and [[cash crop]]s. However, commodity prices declined throughout the 1970s causing economic problems for Sudan. At the same time, debt servicing costs, from the money spent mechanizing agriculture, rose. In 1978, the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] negotiated a [[Structural Adjustment Program]] with the government. This further promoted the mechanised export agriculture sector. This caused great hardship for the pastoralists of Sudan (see [[Nuba peoples#Effect of private agriculture schemes|Nuba peoples]]). In 1976, the Ansars had mounted a bloody but unsuccessful coup attempt. But in July 1977, President Nimeiry met with Ansar leader [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]], opening the way for a possible reconciliation. Hundreds of political prisoners were released, and in August a general amnesty was announced for all oppositionists.\n\n===Bashir government (1989\u20132019)===\n[[File:Omar al-Bashir (2017-11-23) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Omar al-Bashir in 2017]]\n{{further|1989 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat}}\nOn 30 June 1989, Colonel [[Omar al-Bashir]] led a bloodless [[1989 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]].<ref name=reuters-factbox>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKL1435274220080714 |title=Factbox \u2013 Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir |agency=Reuters |accessdate=8 January 2011 |date=14 July 2008}}</ref> The new military government suspended political parties and introduced an Islamic legal code on the national level.<ref name=\"Bekele\">{{cite news |last=Bekele |first=Yilma |title=Chickens Are Coming Home To Roost! |url=http://www.ethiopianreview.com/content/2929 |work=[[Ethiopian Review]] |location=Addis Ababa |date=12 July 2008 |accessdate=13 January 2011}}</ref> Later al-Bashir carried out purges and executions in the upper ranks of the army, the banning of associations, political parties, and independent newspapers, and the imprisonment of leading political figures and journalists.<ref name=\"Kepel, Jihad 2002, p.181\">{{cite book|last=Kepel|first=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|url=https://archive.org/details/jihad00gill_0|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01090-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/jihad00gill_0/page/181 181]}}</ref> On 16 October 1993, al-Bashir appointed himself \"[[President of Sudan|President]]\" and disbanded the Revolutionary Command Council.

It is the [[Varieties of Arabic|variety of Arabic]], an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch spoken throughout Sudan. The dialect has borrowed much vocabulary from local Nilo-Saharan languages ([[Nobiin language|Nobiin]], [[Fur language|Fur]], [[Zaghawa language|Zaghawa]], [[Maba language|Mabang]]). This has resulted in a variety of Arabic that is unique to Sudan, reflecting the way in which the country has been influenced by Nilotic, Arab, and western cultures. Few nomads in Sudan still have similar accents to the ones in [[Saudi Arabia]]. Other important languages include [[Beja language|Beja]] (Bedawi) along the [[Red Sea]], with perhaps two million speakers. It is the language from the Afroasiatic family's [[Cushitic language|Cushitic]] branch that is today spoken in the territory. The second most spoken language in eastern Sudan is the [[Tigre language|Tigre language]], spoken by the other portion of the [[Beja people|Beja]], the [[Bani-amir]] and by the [[Tigre people|Tigre people]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nAs with South Sudan, a number of [[Nilo-Saharan languages]] are also spoken in Sudan. [[Fur language|Fur]] speakers inhabit the west ([[Darfur]]), with perhaps a million speakers. There are likewise various [[Nubian languages]] along the Nile in the north. The most linguistically diverse region in the country is the [[Nuba Hills]] area in Kordofan, inhabited by speakers of multiple language families, with Darfur and other border regions being second.\n\nThe [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger\u2013Congo]] family is represented by many of the [[Kordofanian languages]], and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] by [[Domari language|Domari]] (Gypsy) and English. Historically, [[Old Nubian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] were the languages of [[Christian Nubia]], while [[Meroitic language|Meroitic]] was the language of the [[Kingdom of Kush]], which conquered Egypt.\n\nSudan also has multiple regional sign languages, which are not [[mutually intelligible]].

Northern and western Muslims have dominated the country's political and economic system since independence. The NCP draws much of its support from [[Islamists]], [[Salafis]]/[[Wahhabis]] and other conservative Arab Muslims in the north. The [[Ummah|Umma]] Party has traditionally attracted Arab followers of the Ansar sect of Sufism as well as non-Arab Muslims from Darfur and Kordofan.

Beginning with the imposition of strict [[Salafi]] interpretation of ''[[sharia]]'' law in 1989, many of the country's most prominent poets, like [[Mahjoub Sharif]], were imprisoned while others, like [[Mohammed el Amin]] (returned to Sudan in the mid-1990s) and [[Mohammed Wardi]] (returned to Sudan 2003), fled to Cairo. Traditional music suffered too, with traditional [[Z\u0101r]] ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated {{ref_label|roughguide|1|a}}. At the same time European militaries contributed to the development of Sudanese music by introducing new instruments and styles; military bands, especially the Scottish [[bagpipes]], were renowned, and set traditional music to [[march (music)|military march]] music. The march ''March Shulkawi No 1'', is an example, set to the sounds of the [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]]. Northern Sudan listens to different music than the rest of Sudan. A type of music called Aldlayib uses a musical instrument called the Tambur. The Tambur has five strings and is made from wood and makes music accompanied by the voices of human applause and singing artists. This music has a perfect blend that gives the area of the Northern State a special character.\n\n=== Cinema and photography===\n{{Main|Cinema of Sudan|Photography of Sudan}}\nThe [[cinema of Sudan]] began with [[cinematography]] by the [[History of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|British colonial presence]] in the early 20th century. After independence in 1956, a vigorous documentary film tradition was established, but financial pressures and serious constraints imposed by the [[Islamism|Islamist]] government led to the decline of filmmaking from the 1990s onwards. Since the 2010s, several initiatives have shown an encouraging revival of filmmaking and public interest in film shows and festivals, albeit limited mainly to Khartoum.\n\nThe use of [[Photography of Sudan|photography in Sudan]] goes back to the 1880s and the [[Turkish Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian rule]]. As in other countries, the growing importance of photography for [[mass media]] like newspapers, as well as for amateur photographers led to a wider photographic [[documentation]] and [[Photojournalism#Golden age|use of photographs]] in Sudan during the 20th century and beyond. In the 21st century, photography in Sudan has undergone important changes, mainly due to [[digital photography]] and distribution through [[social media]] and the [[internet]].\n\n===Sport===\nThe most popular sports in Sudan are athletics ([[track and field]]) and [[Association football|football]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Though not as successful as football, [[basketball]], [[team handball|handball]], and [[volleyball]] are also popular in Sudan. In the 1960s and 1970s, the [[Sudan national basketball team|national basketball team]] finished among the continent's top teams.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Nowadays, it is only a minor force.\n\nSudanese football has a long history. Sudan was one of the four African nations \u2013 the others being Egypt, Ethiopia and South Africa \u2013 which formed African football. Sudan hosted the first [[African Cup of Nations]] in 1956, and has won the African Cup of Nations once, in 1970. Two years later, the Sudan's National Football Team participated in the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]] in [[Munich]]. The [[Khartoum|nation's capital]] is home to the Khartoum League, which is considered to be the oldest football league in Africa.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nSudanese football teams such as [[Al-Hilal Club (Omdurman)|Al-Hilal]], [[Al-Merrikh SC|Al-Merrikh]], and Abdelgadir Osman FC are among the nation's strongest teams. Other teams like Khartoum, El-Neel, [[Al-Nidal El-Nahud]] and [[Hay-Al Arab]], are also starting to grow in popularity.\n\n===Clothing===\nMost Sudanese wear either traditional or western attire. A traditional garb widely worn by Sudanese men is the [[jalabiya|galabiya]], which is a loose-fitting, long-sleeved, collarless ankle-length garment also common to [[Egypt]]. The galabiya is often accompanied by a large turban and a scarf, and the garment may be white, colored, striped, and made of fabric varying in thickness, depending on the season of the year and personal preferences.\n\nThe most common dress for Sudanese women is the ''thobe'' or ''[[thawb]]'', pronounced ''tobe'' in Sudanese dialect. The thobe is a white or colorful long one piece cloth that women wrap around their inner garments, usually covering their head and hair. \n\nDue to a 1991 penal code, women cannot wear trousers in public because it is interpreted as an \"obscene outfit.\" A woman was facing up to 40 lashes for wearing trousers, but after being found guilty she was fined the equivalent of 200 U.S. dollars instead.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/08/world/africa/08sudan.html?_r=0| work=The New York Times | first1=Jeffrey | last1=Gettleman | first2=Waleed | last2=Arafat | title=Sudan Court Fines Woman for Wearing Trousers | date=8 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in Sudan}}\n[[File:Faculty of Science (University of Khartoum) 002.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Khartoum University]] established in 1902]]\nEducation in Sudan is free and compulsory for children aged 6 to 13 years, although more than 40% of children are not going to schools due to the economic situation.

After the fall of Kush, the [[Nubians]] formed the three Christian kingdoms of [[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]], with the latter two lasting until around 1500. Between the 14th and 15th centuries much of Sudan was settled by [[Bedouin|Arab nomads]]. From the 16th\u201319th centuries, central and eastern Sudan were dominated by the [[Sultanate of Sennar|Funj sultanate]], while [[Sultanate of Darfur|Darfur]] ruled the west and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] the far north. This period saw extensive [[Islamisation]] and [[Arabisation]].\n\nFrom 1820 to 1874 the entirety of Sudan was conquered by the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]]. Between 1881 and 1885, the harsh Egyptian reign was eventually met with a successful [[Mahdist War|revolt]] led by the self-proclaimed [[Mahdi]] [[Muhammad Ahmad]], resulting in the establishment of the [[Mahdist Sudan|Caliphate of Omdurman]]. This state was eventually destroyed in 1898 by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]], who would then [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|govern Sudan together with Egypt]].\n\nThe 20th century saw the growth of Sudanese nationalism and in 1953 Britain granted Sudan self-government. Independence was proclaimed on 1 January 1956. Since independence, Sudan has been ruled by a series of unstable parliamentary governments and military regimes. Under [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], Sudan instituted [[Sharia|Islamic law]] in 1983.<ref name=\"sudan.gov.sd\">{{cite web |url=http://sudan.gov.sd/ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=39&Itemid=75 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902160838/http://sudan.gov.sd/ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=39&Itemid=75 |archive-date=2 September 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> This exacerbated the rift between the Islamic north, the seat of the government and the Animists and Christians in the [[South Sudan|south]].

Pharaoh [[Piye]] attempted to expand the empire into the Near East but was thwarted by the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]].\n\nThe Kingdom of Kush is mentioned in the Bible as having saved the Israelites from the wrath of the Assyrians, although disease among the besiegers was the main reason for the failure to take the city.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roux, Georges |title=Ancient Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klZX8B_RzzYC|date= 1992|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-193825-7}}</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2013}}\nThe war that took place between Pharaoh [[Taharqa]] and the Assyrian king [[Sennacherib]] was a decisive event in western history, with the Nubians being defeated in their attempts to gain a foothold in the [[Near East]] by Assyria. Sennacherib's successor [[Esarhaddon]] went further and invaded Egypt itself to secure his control of the Levant. This succeeded, as he managed to expel Taharqa from Lower Egypt. Taharqa fled back to Upper Egypt and Nubia, where he died two years later. Lower Egypt came under Assyrian vassalage but proved unruly, unsuccessfully rebelling against the Assyrians. Then, the king [[Tantamani]], a successor of Taharqa, made a final determined attempt to regain Lower Egypt from the newly re-instated Assyrian vassal [[Necho I]]. He managed to retake [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] killing Necho in the process and besieged cities in the Nile Delta. [[Ashurbanipal]], who had succeeded Esarhaddon,  sent a large army in Egypt to regain control. He routed Tantamani near Memphis and, pursuing him, [[Sack of Thebes|sacked Thebes]]. Although the Assyrians immediately departed Upper Egypt after these events, weakened, Thebes peacefully submitted itself to Necho's son [[Psamtik I]] less than a decade later. This ended all hopes of a revival of the Nubian Empire, which rather continued in the form of a smaller kingdom centered on [[Napata]]. The city was raided by the Egyptian c. 590 BC and the Kushite resettled in [[Mero\u00eb]].\n\nDuring Classical Antiquity, the Nubian capital was still at Mero\u00eb. In [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as [[Ethiopia]] (a term also used earlier by the Assyrians when encountering the Nubians). The civilization of Kush was among the first in the world to use iron smelting technology. The Nubian kingdom at Mero\u00eb persisted until the mid-fourth century AD.\n\n===Medieval Christian Nubian kingdoms (c. 350\u20131500)===\n{{main|Nobatia|Makuria|Alodia|Daju kingdom}} \n[[File:Christian Nubia.png|thumb|upright=0.9|The three Christian Nubian kingdoms.

Muhammad Ahmad died on 22 June 1885, a mere six months after the conquest of Khartoum. After a power struggle amongst his deputies, [[Abdallahi ibn Muhammad]], with the help primarily of the [[Baggara]] of western Sudan, overcame the opposition of the others and emerged as unchallenged leader of the Mahdiyah. After consolidating his power, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad assumed the title of ''Khalifa'' (successor) of the Mahdi, instituted an administration, and appointed [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]] (who were usually [[Baggara]]) as emirs over each of the several provinces.\n\n[[File:Battle of Omdurman-1.JPG|thumb|250px|The flight of the Khalifa after his defeat at the [[Battle of Omdurman]].]]\n\nRegional relations remained tense throughout much of the Mahdiyah period, largely because of the Khalifa's brutal methods to extend his rule throughout the country.

In March 1889, king [[Yohannes IV]] of Ethiopia marched on [[Metemma]]; however, after Yohannes fell in battle, the Ethiopian forces withdrew. Abd ar Rahman an Nujumi, the Khalifa's general, attempted an invasion of Egypt in 1889, but British-led Egyptian troops defeated the Ansar at Tushkah. The failure of the Egyptian invasion broke the spell of the Ansar's invincibility. The [[Belgium|Belgians]] prevented the Mahdi's men from conquering [[Equatoria]], and in 1893, the Italians repelled an Ansar attack at [[Agordat]] (in [[Eritrea]]) and forced the Ansar to withdraw from Ethiopia.\n\nIn the 1890s, the British sought to re-establish their control over Sudan, once more officially in the name of the Egyptian Khedive, but in actuality treating the country as a British colony. By the early 1890s, British, French and Belgian claims had converged at the [[Nile]] headwaters. Britain feared that the other powers would take advantage of Sudan's instability to acquire territory previously annexed to Egypt. Apart from these political considerations, Britain wanted to establish control over the Nile to safeguard a planned irrigation dam at [[Aswan]].

The British Imperial General Staff prepared for military defence of the region, which was thin on the ground.<ref>Sir Miles Lampson quoted in a diary, 29 September 1938; Morewood, p.117</ref> The British ambassador blocked Italian attempts to secure a Non-Aggression Treaty with Egypt-Sudan. But Mahmoud was a supporter of the [[Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]; the region was caught between the Empire's efforts to save the Jews, and moderate Arab calls to halt migration.<ref>Morewood, p.164-5</ref>\n\nThe Sudanese Government was directly involved militarily in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]]. Formed in 1925, the [[Sudan Defence Force]] played an active part in responding to incursions early in World War Two.  Italian troops occupied [[Kassala]] and other border areas from [[Italian East Africa|Italian Somaliland]] during 1940.  In 1942, the SDF also played a part in the invasion of the Italian colony by British and Commonwealth forces.  The last British [[governor-general]] was [[Robert George Howe]].\n\nThe [[Egyptian revolution of 1952]] finally heralded the beginning of the march towards Sudanese independence. Having abolished the monarchy in 1953, Egypt's new leaders, [[Mohammed Naguib]], whose mother was Sudanese, and later [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], believed the only way to end British domination in Sudan was for Egypt to officially abandon its claims of sovereignty. In addition Nasser knew it would be difficult for Egypt to govern an impoverished Sudan after its independence. The British on the other hand continued their political and financial support for the Mahdist successor, [[Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi]], whom it was believed would resist Egyptian pressure for Sudanese independence.  Rahman was capable of this, but his regime was plagued by political ineptitude, which garnered a colossal loss of support in northern and central Sudan. Both Egypt and Britain sensed a great instability fomenting, and thus opted to allow both Sudanese regions, north and south to have a free vote on whether they wished independence or a British withdrawal.\n\n===Independence (1956\u2013present)===\n{{Main|History of Sudan (1956\u201369)|History of Sudan (1969\u201385)|History of Sudan (1986\u2013present)}}\n{{Missing information|section|the history of Sudan between 1956 and 1969 and between 1977 and 1989|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:Sudan independence 2.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|Sudan's flag raised at independence ceremony on 1 January 1956 by the Prime Minister Ismail al-Azhari and in presence of opposition leader Mohamed Ahmed Almahjoub]] \nA polling process was carried out resulting in composition of a democratic parliament and [[Ismail al-Azhari]] was elected first Prime Minister and led the first modern Sudanese government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sudan-embassy.co.uk/en/content/blogcategory/28/37 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120035130/http://sudan-embassy.co.uk/en/content/blogcategory/28/37 |archivedate=20 November 2008 |title=Brief History of the Sudan |publisher=Sudan Embassy in London |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> On 1 January 1956, in a special ceremony held at the People's Palace, the Egyptian and British flags were lowered and the new Sudanese flag, composed of green, blue and yellow stripes, was raised in their place by the prime minister [[Ismail al-Azhari]].\n\nDissatisfaction culminated in a second [[1969 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] on 25 May 1969. The coup leader, Col. [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], became prime minister, and the new regime abolished parliament and outlawed all political parties. Disputes between [[Marxist]] and non-Marxist elements within the ruling military coalition resulted in [[1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat|a briefly successful coup in July 1971]], led by the [[Sudanese Communist Party]]. Several days later, anti-communist military elements restored Nimeiry to power.\n\nIn 1972, the [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]] led to a cessation of the north\u2013south civil war and a degree of self-rule. This led to ten years hiatus in the civil war but an end to American investment in the [[Jonglei Canal]] project.  This had been considered absolutely essential to irrigate the Upper Nile region and to prevent an environmental catastrophe and wide-scale famine among the local tribes, most especially the Dinka. In the civil war that followed their homeland was raided, looted, pillaged and burned.  Many of the tribe were murdered in a bloody civil war that raged for over 20 years.\n\n[[File:Hashem al Atta, 1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat.jpg|thumb|[[1971 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat]]]]\nUntil the early 1970s, Sudan's agricultural output was mostly dedicated to internal consumption. In 1972, the Sudanese government became more pro-Western, and made plans to export food and [[cash crop]]s. However, commodity prices declined throughout the 1970s causing economic problems for Sudan. At the same time, debt servicing costs, from the money spent mechanizing agriculture, rose. In 1978, the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] negotiated a [[Structural Adjustment Program]] with the government. This further promoted the mechanised export agriculture sector. This caused great hardship for the pastoralists of Sudan (see [[Nuba peoples#Effect of private agriculture schemes|Nuba peoples]]). In 1976, the Ansars had mounted a bloody but unsuccessful coup attempt. But in July 1977, President Nimeiry met with Ansar leader [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]], opening the way for a possible reconciliation. Hundreds of political prisoners were released, and in August a general amnesty was announced for all oppositionists.\n\n===Bashir government (1989\u20132019)===\n[[File:Omar al-Bashir (2017-11-23) (cropped).jpg|thumb|300px|right|Omar al-Bashir in 2017]]\n{{further|1989 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat}}\nOn 30 June 1989, Colonel [[Omar al-Bashir]] led a bloodless [[1989 Sudanese coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]].<ref name=reuters-factbox>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKL1435274220080714 |title=Factbox \u2013 Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir |agency=Reuters |accessdate=8 January 2011 |date=14 July 2008}}</ref> The new military government suspended political parties and introduced an Islamic legal code on the national level.<ref name=\"Bekele\">{{cite news |last=Bekele |first=Yilma |title=Chickens Are Coming Home To Roost! |url=http://www.ethiopianreview.com/content/2929 |work=[[Ethiopian Review]] |location=Addis Ababa |date=12 July 2008 |accessdate=13 January 2011}}</ref> Later al-Bashir carried out purges and executions in the upper ranks of the army, the banning of associations, political parties, and independent newspapers, and the imprisonment of leading political figures and journalists.<ref name=\"Kepel, Jihad 2002, p.181\">{{cite book|last=Kepel|first=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|url=https://archive.org/details/jihad00gill_0|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01090-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/jihad00gill_0/page/181 181]}}</ref> On 16 October 1993, al-Bashir appointed himself \"[[President of Sudan|President]]\" and disbanded the Revolutionary Command Council.

Two popular divisions of Sufism, the Ansar and the Khatmia, are associated with the opposition Umma and Democratic Unionist parties, respectively. Only the Darfur region has traditionally been bereft of the Sufi brotherhoods common in the rest of the country.<ref>Hamid Eltgani Ali, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4BNUBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA9&dq=warsh+quran&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=warsh&f=false Darfur's Political Economy: A Quest for Development], pg. 9.

The [[Sudan Evangelical Presbyterian Church]] also has membership.{{fix|text=along with which others within current borders?}}\n\nReligious identity plays a role in the country's political divisions. Northern and western Muslims have dominated the country's political and economic system since independence. The NCP draws much of its support from [[Islamists]], [[Salafis]]/[[Wahhabis]] and other conservative Arab Muslims in the north. The [[Ummah|Umma]] Party has traditionally attracted Arab followers of the Ansar sect of Sufism as well as non-Arab Muslims from Darfur and Kordofan. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) includes both Arab and non-Arab Muslims in the north and east, especially those in the Khatmia Sufi sect.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Further|Music of Sudan|Cinema of Sudan|Photography of Sudan|List of Sudanese writers}}\nSudanese culture melds the behaviors, practices, and beliefs of about 578 ethnic groups, communicating in 145 different languages, in a region microcosmic of Africa, with geographic extremes varying from sandy desert to tropical forest. Recent evidence suggests that while most citizens of the country identify strongly with both Sudan and their religion, Arab and African supranational identities are much more polarising and contested.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf|title=Hamilton, A. and Hudson, J.

Beginning with the imposition of strict [[Salafi]] interpretation of ''[[sharia]]'' law in 1989, many of the country's most prominent poets, like [[Mahjoub Sharif]], were imprisoned while others, like [[Mohammed el Amin]] (returned to Sudan in the mid-1990s) and [[Mohammed Wardi]] (returned to Sudan 2003), fled to Cairo. Traditional music suffered too, with traditional [[Z\u0101r]] ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated {{ref_label|roughguide|1|a}}. At the same time European militaries contributed to the development of Sudanese music by introducing new instruments and styles; military bands, especially the Scottish [[bagpipes]], were renowned, and set traditional music to [[march (music)|military march]] music. The march ''March Shulkawi No 1'', is an example, set to the sounds of the [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]]. Northern Sudan listens to different music than the rest of Sudan. A type of music called Aldlayib uses a musical instrument called the Tambur. The Tambur has five strings and is made from wood and makes music accompanied by the voices of human applause and singing artists. This music has a perfect blend that gives the area of the Northern State a special character.\n\n=== Cinema and photography===\n{{Main|Cinema of Sudan|Photography of Sudan}}\nThe [[cinema of Sudan]] began with [[cinematography]] by the [[History of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|British colonial presence]] in the early 20th century. After independence in 1956, a vigorous documentary film tradition was established, but financial pressures and serious constraints imposed by the [[Islamism|Islamist]] government led to the decline of filmmaking from the 1990s onwards. Since the 2010s, several initiatives have shown an encouraging revival of filmmaking and public interest in film shows and festivals, albeit limited mainly to Khartoum.\n\nThe use of [[Photography of Sudan|photography in Sudan]] goes back to the 1880s and the [[Turkish Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian rule]]. As in other countries, the growing importance of photography for [[mass media]] like newspapers, as well as for amateur photographers led to a wider photographic [[documentation]] and [[Photojournalism#Golden age|use of photographs]] in Sudan during the 20th century and beyond. In the 21st century, photography in Sudan has undergone important changes, mainly due to [[digital photography]] and distribution through [[social media]] and the [[internet]].\n\n===Sport===\nThe most popular sports in Sudan are athletics ([[track and field]]) and [[Association football|football]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Though not as successful as football, [[basketball]], [[team handball|handball]], and [[volleyball]] are also popular in Sudan. In the 1960s and 1970s, the [[Sudan national basketball team|national basketball team]] finished among the continent's top teams.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Nowadays, it is only a minor force.\n\nSudanese football has a long history. Sudan was one of the four African nations \u2013 the others being Egypt, Ethiopia and South Africa \u2013 which formed African football. Sudan hosted the first [[African Cup of Nations]] in 1956, and has won the African Cup of Nations once, in 1970. Two years later, the Sudan's National Football Team participated in the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]] in [[Munich]]. The [[Khartoum|nation's capital]] is home to the Khartoum League, which is considered to be the oldest football league in Africa.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nSudanese football teams such as [[Al-Hilal Club (Omdurman)|Al-Hilal]], [[Al-Merrikh SC|Al-Merrikh]], and Abdelgadir Osman FC are among the nation's strongest teams. Other teams like Khartoum, El-Neel, [[Al-Nidal El-Nahud]] and [[Hay-Al Arab]], are also starting to grow in popularity.\n\n===Clothing===\nMost Sudanese wear either traditional or western attire. A traditional garb widely worn by Sudanese men is the [[jalabiya|galabiya]], which is a loose-fitting, long-sleeved, collarless ankle-length garment also common to [[Egypt]]. The galabiya is often accompanied by a large turban and a scarf, and the garment may be white, colored, striped, and made of fabric varying in thickness, depending on the season of the year and personal preferences.\n\nThe most common dress for Sudanese women is the ''thobe'' or ''[[thawb]]'', pronounced ''tobe'' in Sudanese dialect. The thobe is a white or colorful long one piece cloth that women wrap around their inner garments, usually covering their head and hair. \n\nDue to a 1991 penal code, women cannot wear trousers in public because it is interpreted as an \"obscene outfit.\" A woman was facing up to 40 lashes for wearing trousers, but after being found guilty she was fined the equivalent of 200 U.S. dollars instead.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/08/world/africa/08sudan.html?_r=0| work=The New York Times | first1=Jeffrey | last1=Gettleman | first2=Waleed | last2=Arafat | title=Sudan Court Fines Woman for Wearing Trousers | date=8 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in Sudan}}\n[[File:Faculty of Science (University of Khartoum) 002.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Khartoum University]] established in 1902]]\nEducation in Sudan is free and compulsory for children aged 6 to 13 years, although more than 40% of children are not going to schools due to the economic situation.
