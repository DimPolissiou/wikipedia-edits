Various compound with similar structure activity relationships to cocaine that aren't technically analogues have been developed as well.\n\n==Mechanisms of action==\n{{see also|central fatigue}}\nStimulants can have a wide variety of mechanisms. Many stimulants exert their effects through manipulations of [[monoamine]] [[neurotransmission]].  Monoamines are a class of neurotransmitter relevant in reward, motivation, temperature regulation and pain sensation that include [[dopamine]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[serotonin]]. Stimulants usually block the reuptake or stimulate the efflux of dopamine and norepinephrine resulting in increased activity of their circuits. Some stimulants, notably those with [[empathogen]]ic and [[hallucinogen]]ic effects alter serotonergic neurotransmission.  Interference with vesicular storage, activating [[TAAR1]], and reversing the flow of monoamine transporters may play a mechanism in the activity of these drugs. Adrenergic stimulants, such as ephedrine, may act by directly binding and activating the receptors that norepinephrine and epinephrine normally bind to ([[adrenergic receptor]]s), producing sympathomimetic effects. Some drugs, such as [[MDMA]] and derivatives may decrease regulatory capability by antagonizing regulatory pre-synaptic auto receptors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Docherty|first1=J R|title=Pharmacology of stimulants prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|date=7 January 2017|volume=154|issue=3|pages=606\u2013622|doi=10.1038/bjp.2008.124|pmc=2439527|issn=0007-1188|pmid=18500382}}</ref> Caffeine is a notable exception, as it exerts its effects by antagonizing [[adenosine receptor]]s instead of acting directly on monoamines.<ref>{{cite book|title=Caffeine for the Sustainment of Mental Task Performance: Formulations for Military Operations.|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|location=Washington (DC)|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223808/|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009140913/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223808/|archivedate=9 October 2017|df=dmy-all|year=2001}}</ref>\n\n== Notable stimulants ==\n\n=== Amphetamine  ===\n{{Main|Amphetamine}}\n\nAmphetamine is a potent [[central nervous system]] (CNS) stimulant of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine class]] that is approved for the treatment of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and [[narcolepsy]].<ref name=\"FDA Abuse & OD\">{{cite web |title=Adderall XR Prescribing Information |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/021303s024lbl.pdf |page=11 |work=United States Food and Drug Administration |date=June 2013 |accessdate=7 January 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101218/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/021303s024lbl.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two [[enantiomer]]s: [[levoamphetamine]] and [[dextroamphetamine]].{{#tag:ref|Enantiomers are molecules that are ''mirror images'' of one another; they are structurally identical, but of the opposite orientation.<br />Levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine are also known as L-amph or levamfetamine ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) and D-amph or dexamfetamine (INN) respectively.|group = \"note\"}}<ref name=\"Amph Uses\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Heal DJ, Smith SL, Gosden J, Nutt DJ |title=Amphetamine, past and present \u2013 a pharmacological and clinical perspective |journal=J.

Its effects at therapeutic doses include increased focus, increased alertness, decreased appetite, decreased need for sleep and decreased impulsivity. Methylphenidate is not usually used recreationally, but when it is used, its effects are very similar to those of amphetamines.\n\nMethylphenidate acts a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, by blocking the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET) and the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT). Methylphenidate has a higher affinity for the dopamine transporter than for the norepinephrine transporter, and so its effects are mainly due to elevated dopamine levels caused by the inhibited reuptake  of dopamine, however increased norepinephrine levels also contribute to various of the effects caused by the drug.\n\nMethylphenidate is sold under a number of brand names including Ritalin. Other versions include the long lasting tablet Concerta and the long lasting transdermal patch Daytrana.\n\nA 2018 [[Cochrane review]] found tentative evidence that methylphenidate may result in serious side effects such as heart problems, psychosis, and death.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Storeb\u00f8 |first1=Ole Jakob |last2=Pedersen |first2=Nadia |last3=Ramstad |first3=Erica |last4=Kielsholm |first4=Maja Laerke |last5=Nielsen |first5=Signe Sofie |last6=Krogh |first6=Helle B |last7=Moreira-Maia |first7=Carlos R |last8=Magnusson |first8=Frederik L |last9=Holmskov |first9=Mathilde |last10=Gerner |first10=Trine |last11=Skoog |first11=Maria |last12=Rosendal |first12=Susanne |last13=Groth |first13=Camilla |last14=Gillies |first14=Donna |last15=Buch Rasmussen |first15=Kirsten |last16=Gauci |first16=Dorothy |last17=Zwi |first17=Morris |last18=Kirubakaran |first18=Richard |last19=H\u00e5konsen |first19=Sasja J |last20=Aagaard |first20=Lise |last21=Simonsen |first21=Erik |last22=Gluud |first22=Christian |title=Methylphenidate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents - assessment of adverse events in non-randomised studies |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=10 May 2018 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD012069.pub2 |pmid=29744873 |volume=5 |pmc=6494554 |page=CD012069}}</ref>\n\n=== Cocaine ===\n[[File:Cocaine lines 2.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Lines of illicit [[cocaine]], used as a [[recreational drug|recreational]] stimulant]]\n{{Main|Cocaine}}\nCocaine is an [[SNDRI]]. Cocaine is made from the leaves of the [[coca]] shrub, which grows in the mountain regions of South American countries such as [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], and [[Peru]]. In Europe, North America, and some parts of Asia, the most common form of cocaine is a white crystalline powder. Cocaine is a stimulant but is not normally prescribed therapeutically for its stimulant properties, although it sees clinical use as a local anesthetic, in particular in [[ophthalmology]]. Most cocaine use is recreational and its abuse potential is high (higher than amphetamine), and so its sale and possession are strictly controlled in most jurisdictions.

Stimulants usually block the reuptake or stimulate the efflux of dopamine and norepinephrine resulting in increased activity of their circuits. Some stimulants, notably those with [[empathogen]]ic and [[hallucinogen]]ic effects alter serotonergic neurotransmission.  Interference with vesicular storage, activating [[TAAR1]], and reversing the flow of monoamine transporters may play a mechanism in the activity of these drugs. Adrenergic stimulants, such as ephedrine, may act by directly binding and activating the receptors that norepinephrine and epinephrine normally bind to ([[adrenergic receptor]]s), producing sympathomimetic effects. Some drugs, such as [[MDMA]] and derivatives may decrease regulatory capability by antagonizing regulatory pre-synaptic auto receptors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Docherty|first1=J R|title=Pharmacology of stimulants prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|date=7 January 2017|volume=154|issue=3|pages=606\u2013622|doi=10.1038/bjp.2008.124|pmc=2439527|issn=0007-1188|pmid=18500382}}</ref> Caffeine is a notable exception, as it exerts its effects by antagonizing [[adenosine receptor]]s instead of acting directly on monoamines.<ref>{{cite book|title=Caffeine for the Sustainment of Mental Task Performance: Formulations for Military Operations.|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|location=Washington (DC)|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223808/|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009140913/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223808/|archivedate=9 October 2017|df=dmy-all|year=2001}}</ref>\n\n== Notable stimulants ==\n\n=== Amphetamine  ===\n{{Main|Amphetamine}}\n\nAmphetamine is a potent [[central nervous system]] (CNS) stimulant of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine class]] that is approved for the treatment of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and [[narcolepsy]].<ref name=\"FDA Abuse & OD\">{{cite web |title=Adderall XR Prescribing Information |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/021303s024lbl.pdf |page=11 |work=United States Food and Drug Administration |date=June 2013 |accessdate=7 January 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101218/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/021303s024lbl.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two [[enantiomer]]s: [[levoamphetamine]] and [[dextroamphetamine]].{{#tag:ref|Enantiomers are molecules that are ''mirror images'' of one another; they are structurally identical, but of the opposite orientation.<br />Levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine are also known as L-amph or levamfetamine ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]]) and D-amph or dexamfetamine (INN) respectively.|group = \"note\"}}<ref name=\"Amph Uses\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Heal DJ, Smith SL, Gosden J, Nutt DJ |title=Amphetamine, past and present \u2013 a pharmacological and clinical perspective |journal=J.

Methylphenidate is not usually used recreationally, but when it is used, its effects are very similar to those of amphetamines.\n\nMethylphenidate acts a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, by blocking the [[norepinephrine transporter]] (NET) and the [[dopamine transporter]] (DAT). Methylphenidate has a higher affinity for the dopamine transporter than for the norepinephrine transporter, and so its effects are mainly due to elevated dopamine levels caused by the inhibited reuptake  of dopamine, however increased norepinephrine levels also contribute to various of the effects caused by the drug.\n\nMethylphenidate is sold under a number of brand names including Ritalin.

Cocaine is a stimulant but is not normally prescribed therapeutically for its stimulant properties, although it sees clinical use as a local anesthetic, in particular in [[ophthalmology]]. Most cocaine use is recreational and its abuse potential is high (higher than amphetamine), and so its sale and possession are strictly controlled in most jurisdictions. Other [[tropane]] derivative drugs related to cocaine are also known such as [[troparil]] and [[lometopane]] but have not been widely sold or used recreationally.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=AJ Giannini |author2=WC Price |title=Contemporary drugs of abuse |journal=American Family Physician |volume=33 |pages=207\u2013213 |year=1986}}</ref>\n\n=== Nicotine ===\n{{Main|Nicotine}}\n\n[[Nicotine]] is the active chemical constituent in [[tobacco]], which is available in many forms, including [[cigarette]]s, [[cigar]]s, [[chewing tobacco]], and [[smoking cessation]] aids such as [[nicotine patch]]es, [[nicotine gum]], and [[electronic cigarette]]s.

They practiced a sort of ''jirga'' system with two types of councils \u2013 ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' and ''{{transl|pus|sabh\u0101}}''. The ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' (summit) comprised elders and tribal chiefs. The king also joined sessions of the ''{{transl|pus|simite}}''. ''Sabh\u0101'' was a sort of rural council. In India it is referred to as ''Samiti'' and ''Sabha''.\n\nIt was used over time for the selection of rulers and headmen and the airing of matters of principle. From the time of the great Kushan ruler [[Kanishka]] to the 1970s, there were sixteen [[nation]]al ''loya jirgas'' and hundreds of smaller ones. The institution, which is centuries old, is a similar idea to the Islamic ''[[shura]]'' (consultative assembly).<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn the [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan society]], the ''loya jirga'' is still maintained and favored, mostly by tribal leaders to solve internal or external disputes with other tribes. In some cases it functions like a [[town hall meeting]].\n\nWhen the Afghans took power they tried to legitimize their hold with such a ''jirga''. While in the beginning only Pashtuns were allowed to participate in the ''jirgas'', later other ethnic groups like [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] were allowed to participate as well, however they were little more than observers. The member of the ''jirgas'' were mostly members of the Royal Family, religious leaders and tribal leaders of the Afghans. King [[Amanullah Khan]] institutionalized the ''jirga''. From Amanullah until the reign of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] (1933\u20131973) and [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] (1973\u20131978) the ''jirga'' was recognized as a common meeting of regional Pashtun leaders.\n\nThe meetings do not have scheduled occurrences, but rather are called for when issues or disputes arise. There is no time limit for a ''loya jirga'' to conclude, and the meetings often take time because decisions can only be made as a group and arguments can drag out for days. Various issues can be addressed such as major disaster, foreign policy, declaration of war, the legitimacy of leaders, and the introduction of new ideas and laws.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nSome of the historical ''loya jirgas'' in the [[history of Afghanistan]] are:\n\n*'''October 1747''' \u2013 The First Loya Jirga at [[Kandahar]] was attended by Afghan representatives who appointed [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] as their new leader.\n*'''September 1928''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Paghman]], called by [[King Amanullah]], the third loya jirga of his reign (1919\u20131929) to discuss reforms.\n*'''September 1930''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' of 286 called by [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]] to confirm his accession to the throne.\n*'''1941''' \u2013 Called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve neutrality in [[World War II]].\n*'''1947''' \u2013 Held by Pashtuns in the [[FATA|Tribal Agencies]] to choose between joining [[India]] or [[Pakistan]].\n*'''July 26, 1949''' \u2013 [[Afghanistan-Pakistan relations]] rapidly deteriorated over a dispute, officially declared that it did not recognize the 1893 [[Durand Line]] border any longer between the two countries.<ref>Agha Amin, [http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 \"Resolving the Afghan-Pakistan Border Question\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012045458/http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 |date=October 12, 2008}}, ''Journal of Afghanistan Studies'', Kabul, (accessed December 12, 2009).</ref>\n*'''September 1964''' \u2013 A meeting of 452 called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve a new constitution.\n*'''July 1974''' \u2013 A meeting with Pakistan over the Durand Line.\n*'''[[1977 Afghan Constitutional Assembly election|January 1977]]''' \u2013 Approved the new constitution of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] establishing one-party rule in the [[Daouds Republic of Afghanistan|Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''April 1985''' \u2013 To ratify the new constitution of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''September 2001''' \u2013 Four different loya jirga movements anticipating the end of [[Taliban]] rule.

It is mainly organized for choosing a new [[head of state]] in case of sudden death, adopting a new constitution, or to settle national or regional issue such as war.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1782079.stm | work=BBC News | title=Q&A: What is a loya jirga? | date=July 1, 2002 | accessdate=May 11, 2010}}</ref> It predates modern-day written or fixed laws and is mostly favored by the [[Pashtun people]] but to a lesser extent by other nearby groups that have been influenced by Pashtuns (historically known as [[Afghan (ethnonym)|Afghans]]).\n\nIn [[Afghanistan]], ''loya jirgas'' have been reportedly organized since at least the early 18th century when the [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotaki]] and [[Durrani dynasty|Durrani]] dynasties rose to power.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/opinion/11krakauer.html?scp=8&sq=jon%20krakauer&st=cse |title=To Save Afghanistan, Look to Its Past |author=Jon Krakauer |newspaper=New York Times |date=September 11, 2009 |accessdate=2014-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==History and terminology ==\n\nThere is a myth in the sense that the ancient [[Aryan]] tribes, who are hypothesized to have spoken [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]], came down in intermittent waves from [[Central Asia]] and Afghanistan. They practiced a sort of ''jirga'' system with two types of councils \u2013 ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' and ''{{transl|pus|sabh\u0101}}''. The ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' (summit) comprised elders and tribal chiefs. The king also joined sessions of the ''{{transl|pus|simite}}''. ''Sabh\u0101'' was a sort of rural council. In India it is referred to as ''Samiti'' and ''Sabha''.\n\nIt was used over time for the selection of rulers and headmen and the airing of matters of principle. From the time of the great Kushan ruler [[Kanishka]] to the 1970s, there were sixteen [[nation]]al ''loya jirgas'' and hundreds of smaller ones. The institution, which is centuries old, is a similar idea to the Islamic ''[[shura]]'' (consultative assembly).<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn the [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan society]], the ''loya jirga'' is still maintained and favored, mostly by tribal leaders to solve internal or external disputes with other tribes. In some cases it functions like a [[town hall meeting]].\n\nWhen the Afghans took power they tried to legitimize their hold with such a ''jirga''. While in the beginning only Pashtuns were allowed to participate in the ''jirgas'', later other ethnic groups like [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] were allowed to participate as well, however they were little more than observers. The member of the ''jirgas'' were mostly members of the Royal Family, religious leaders and tribal leaders of the Afghans. King [[Amanullah Khan]] institutionalized the ''jirga''. From Amanullah until the reign of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] (1933\u20131973) and [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] (1973\u20131978) the ''jirga'' was recognized as a common meeting of regional Pashtun leaders.\n\nThe meetings do not have scheduled occurrences, but rather are called for when issues or disputes arise. There is no time limit for a ''loya jirga'' to conclude, and the meetings often take time because decisions can only be made as a group and arguments can drag out for days. Various issues can be addressed such as major disaster, foreign policy, declaration of war, the legitimacy of leaders, and the introduction of new ideas and laws.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nSome of the historical ''loya jirgas'' in the [[history of Afghanistan]] are:\n*'''1707\u20131709''' \u2013 ''Loya jirga'' was gathered by [[Mir Wais Hotak]] at [[Kandahar]] in 1707, but according to [[Ghulam Mohammad Ghobar]] it was gathered in Manja in 1709.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wolas.beepworld.de/mirwaisneeka.htm |title=Mirwais Neeka |publisher=Wolas.beepworld.de |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref>\n*'''October 1747''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Kandahar]] was attended by Afghan representatives who appointed [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] as their new leader.\n*'''September 1928''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Paghman]], called by [[King Amanullah]], the third loya jirga of his reign (1919\u20131929) to discuss reforms.\n*'''September 1930''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' of 286 called by [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]] to confirm his accession to the throne.\n*'''1941''' \u2013 Called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve neutrality in [[World War II]].\n*'''1947''' \u2013 Held by Pashtuns in the [[FATA|Tribal Agencies]] to choose between joining [[India]] or [[Pakistan]].\n*'''July 26, 1949''' \u2013 [[Afghanistan-Pakistan relations]] rapidly deteriorated over a dispute, officially declared that it did not recognize the 1893 [[Durand Line]] border any longer between the two countries.<ref>Agha Amin, [http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 \"Resolving the Afghan-Pakistan Border Question\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012045458/http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 |date=October 12, 2008}}, ''Journal of Afghanistan Studies'', Kabul, (accessed December 12, 2009).</ref>\n*'''September 1964''' \u2013 A meeting of 452 called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve a new constitution.\n*'''July 1974''' \u2013 A meeting with Pakistan over the Durand Line.\n*'''[[1977 Afghan Constitutional Assembly election|January 1977]]''' \u2013 Approved the new constitution of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] establishing one-party rule in the [[Daouds Republic of Afghanistan|Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''April 1985''' \u2013 To ratify the new constitution of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''September 2001''' \u2013 Four different loya jirga movements anticipating the end of [[Taliban]] rule.

Solomon]], ''In the Spirit of Hegel'', Oxford University Press, p. 23.</ref> Like [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] and Kant before him, Fichte was motivated by the problem of [[subjectivity]] and [[consciousness]]. Fichte also wrote works of [[political philosophy]]; he has a reputation as one of the fathers of [[German nationalism]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Origins===\nFichte was born in [[Rammenau]], [[Upper Lusatia]]. The son of a ribbon weaver,<ref name=\"nie\">{{cite NIE|wstitle=Fichte, Johann Gottlieb|year=1905}}</ref> he came of peasant stock which had lived in the region for many generations. The family was noted in the neighborhood for its probity and piety. Christian Fichte, Johann Gottlieb's father, married somewhat above his station. It has been suggested that a certain impatience which Fichte himself displayed throughout his life was an inheritance from his mother.<ref name=\"americana\"/>\n\nHe received the rudiments of his education from his father. He showed remarkable ability from an early age, and it was owing to his reputation among the villagers that he gained the opportunity for a better education than he otherwise would have received. The story runs that the Freiherr von Militz, a country landowner, arrived too late to hear the local pastor preach. He was, however, informed that a lad in the neighborhood would be able to repeat the sermon almost ''verbatim''. As a result, the baron took the lad into his protection, which meant that he paid his tuition.<ref name=\"americana\">{{cite Americana|wstitle=Fichte, Johann Gottlieb|year=1920}}</ref>\n\n===Early schooling===\nFichte was placed in the family of Pastor Krebel at [[Niederau]] near [[Meissen]], and there received a thorough grounding in the [[classics]]. From this time onward, Fichte saw little of his parents. In October 1774, he was attending the celebrated foundation-school at [[Pforta]] near [[Naumburg]]. This school is associated with the names of [[Novalis]], [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]], [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. The spirit of the institution was semi-monastic and, while the education given was excellent in its way, it is doubtful whether there was enough social life and contact with the world for a pupil of Fichte's temperament and antecedents. Perhaps his education strengthened a tendency toward introspection and independence, characteristics which appear strongly in his doctrines and writings.<ref name=\"americana\"/>\n\n===Theological studies and private tutoring===\nIn 1780, he began study at the theology seminary of the [[University of Jena]]. He was transferred a year later to study at the [[Leipzig University]]. Fichte seems to have supported himself at this period of bitter poverty and hard struggle.<ref name=\"americana\"/> Freiherr von Militz continued to support him, but when he died in 1784, Fichte had to end his studies prematurely, without completing his degree.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Breazeale |first1=Daniel |last2=Fichte |first2=Johann |title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=2}}<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nDuring the years 1784 to 1788, he supported himself in a precarious way as tutor in various Saxon families.<ref name=\"nie\"/> In early 1788, he returned to [[Leipzig]] in the hope of finding a better employment, but eventually he had to settle for a much less promising position with the family of an innkeeper in [[Zurich]].<ref>Anthony J.

There he met his future wife, Johanna Rahn,<ref name=\"americana\"/><ref>She happened to be the niece of the famous poet [[F. G. Klopstock]].</ref> and [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]].

This essay, completed in five weeks, was the ''Versuch einer Critik<!--[sic]--> aller Offenbarung'' (''[[Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation]]'', 1792).<ref name=\"americana\"/> In this book, according to Henrich, Fichte investigated the connections between divine revelation and Kant's [[critical philosophy]]. The first edition of the book was published without Kant's or Fichte's knowledge, moreover without Fichte's name or signed preface.

Stirred by the events and principles of the [[French Revolution]], he wrote and anonymously published two pamphlets which led to him being seen as a devoted defender of liberty of thought and action and an advocate of political changes. In December of the same year, he received an invitation to fill the position of extraordinary professor of philosophy at the [[University of Jena]]. He accepted and began his lectures in May of the next year. With extraordinary zeal, he expounded his system of \"[[transcendental idealism]]\". His success was immediate. He seems to have excelled as a lecturer because of the earnestness and force of his personality. These lectures were later published under the title ''The Vocation of the Scholar'' (''Einige Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Bestimmung des Gelehrten'').

For Fichte, God should be conceived primarily in moral terms: \"The living and efficaciously acting moral order is itself God. We require no other God, nor can we grasp any other\" (\"On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance\"). Fichte's intemperate \"Appeal to the Public\" (\"Appellation an das Publikum\", 1799) provoked [[F. H.

By the votes of his colleagues Fichte was unanimously elected its rector in the succeeding year. But, once more, his impetuosity and reforming zeal led to friction, and he resigned in 1812. The campaign against Napoleon began, and the hospitals at Berlin were soon full of patients. Fichte's wife devoted herself to nursing and caught a virulent fever. Just as she was recovering, he himself was stricken down. He died of [[typhus]] at the age of 51.<ref name=\"nie\"/><ref name=\"americana\"/> \n\nHis son, [[Immanuel Hermann Fichte]] (18 July 1796 \u2013 8 August 1879), also made contributions to [[philosophy]].\n\n==Philosophical work==\nIn mimicking Kant's difficult style, his critics argued that Fichte produced works that were barely intelligible. \"He made no hesitation in pluming himself on his great skill in the shadowy and obscure, by often remarking to his pupils, that 'there was only one man in the world who could fully understand his writings; and even he was often at a loss to seize upon his real meaning.{{' \"}}<ref>Robert Blakely, ''History of the Philosophy of Mind'', Vol. IV, p. 114, London: Longmans, 1850</ref> On the other hand, Fichte himself acknowledged the difficulty of his writings, but argued that his works were clear and transparent to those who made the effort to think without preconceptions and prejudices.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nFichte did not endorse Kant's argument for the existence of [[noumenon|noumena]], of \"things in themselves\", the supra-sensible reality beyond the categories of direct human perception. Fichte saw the rigorous and [[system]]atic separation of \"things in themselves\" ([[noumenon|noumena]]) and things \"as they appear to us\" ([[phenomenon|phenomena]]) as an invitation to [[skepticism]]. Rather than invite such skepticism, Fichte made the radical suggestion that we should throw out the notion of a noumenal world and instead accept the fact that [[consciousness]] does not have a grounding in a so-called \"real world\". In fact, Fichte achieved fame for originating the argument that consciousness is not grounded in {{em|anything}} outside of itself. The phenomenal world as such, arises from self-consciousness; the activity of the ego; and moral awareness. His student (and critic), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], wrote:{{Quotation|Fichte who, because the [[thing-in-itself]] had just been discredited, at once prepared a system without any thing-in-itself. Consequently, he rejected the assumption of anything that was not through and through merely our [[Representation (psychology)|representation]], and therefore let the knowing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] be all in all or at any rate produce everything from its own resources. For this purpose, he at once did away with the essential and most meritorious part of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian doctrine, the distinction between ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' and thus that between the [[phenomenon]] and the thing-in-itself. For he declared everything to be ''a priori'', naturally without any evidence for such a monstrous assertion; instead of these, he gave sophisms and even crazy sham demonstrations whose absurdity was concealed under the mask of profundity and of the incomprehensibility ostensibly arising therefrom. Moreover, he appealed boldly and openly to [[intellectual]] [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], that is, really to [[Invention|inspiration]].|Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, \u00a713}}\n\n[[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] was also a student of the writings of Fichte:{{Quotation|Our whole age is imbued with a formal striving. This is what led us to disregard congeniality and to emphasize symmetrical beauty, to prefer conventional rather than sincere social relations. It is this whole striving which is denoted by \u2014 to use the words of another author \u2014 Fichte's and the other philosophers' attempts to construct systems by sharpness of mind and Robespierre's attempt to do it with the help of the guillotine; it is this which meets us in the flowing butterfly verses of our poets and in Auber's music, and finally, it is this which produces the many revolutions in the political world. I agree perfectly with this whole effort to cling to form, insofar as it continues to be the medium through which we have the idea, but it should not be forgotten that it is the idea which should determine the form, not the form which determines the idea. We should keep in mind that life is not something abstract but something extremely individual. We should not forget that, for example, from a poetic genius' position of immediacy, form is nothing but the coming into existence of the idea in the world, and that the task of reflection is only to investigate whether or not the idea has gotten the properly corresponding form. Form is not the basis of life, but life is the basis of form. Imagine that a man long infatuated with the Greek mode of life had acquired the means to arrange for a building in the Greek style and a Grecian household establishment \u2014 whether or not he would be satisfied would be highly problematical, or would he soon prefer another form simply because he had not sufficiently tested himself and the system in which he lived. But just as a leap backward is wrong (something the age, on the whole, is inclined to acknowledge), so also a leap forward is wrong \u2014 both of them because a natural development does not proceed by leaps, and life's earnestness will ironize over every such experiment, even if it succeeds momentarily.|S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, ''Journals'', \"Our Journalistic Literature\", 28 November 1835.<ref>[http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/JournPapers/I_B.html Journals and Papers of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, 1B]</ref>}}\n\n===Central theory===\n{{refimprove|section|date=May 2017}}\nIn his work ''[[Foundations of Natural Right]]'' (1797), Fichte argued that [[self-awareness|self-consciousness]] was a social phenomenon \u2014 an important step and perhaps the first clear step taken in this direction by modern philosophy. A necessary condition of every subject's self-awareness, for Fichte, is the existence of other rational subjects. These others call or summon (''fordern auf'') the subject or self out of its unconsciousness and into an awareness of itself as a free individual.<ref>{{cite web|title=Foundations of Natural Right|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/96398724/Fichte-Foundations-of-Natural-Right-1797|website=Scribd|accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nFichte's account proceeds from the general principle that the I (''das Ich'') must posit itself as an individual in order to posit (''setzen'') itself at all, and that in order to posit itself as an individual it must recognize itself as it were to a calling or summons (''Aufforderung'') by other free individual(s) \u2014 called, moreover, to limit its own freedom out of respect for the freedom of the other. The same condition applied and applies, of course, to the other(s) in its development. Hence, mutual recognition (''gegenseitig anerkennen'') of rational individuals turns out to be a condition necessary for the individual I in general.<ref>Fichte, J. G. (2000), ''Foundations of Natural Right, according to the Principles of the Wissenschaftslehre'', ed. F. Neuhouser, trans. M. Baur. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 42.</ref><ref>[[Allen W. Wood]], ''The Free Development of Each: Studies on Reason, Right, and Ethics in Classical German Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 207: \"The whole point of the summons, in fact, is that it is what first makes our individuality possible for us, through presenting us with the concept of our own individual free action in the form of an object of our consciousness.\"</ref> This argument for [[intersubjectivity]] is central to the conception of selfhood developed in the ''[[Foundations of the Science of Knowledge]]''<ref>Also translated as ''Foundations of the Entire Science of Knowledge''.</ref> (''Grundlage der gesamten<!--[sic]--> Wissenschaftslehre'', 1794/1795). \n\nIn Fichte's view consciousness of the self depends upon resistance or a check by something that is understood as not part of the self yet is not immediately ascribable to a particular sensory perception. In his later 1796\u201399 lectures (his ''Nova methodo''), Fichte incorporated it into his revised presentation of the very foundations of his system, where the summons takes its place alongside original feeling, which takes the place of the earlier ''Anstoss'' (see below) as both a limit upon the absolute freedom of the I and a condition for the positing of the same.\n\nThe I itself posits this situation for itself. To posit does not mean to 'create' the objects of consciousness. The principle in question simply states that the essence of an I lies in the assertion of one's own self-identity, i.e., that consciousness presupposes self-consciousness. Such immediate self-identity, however, cannot be understood as a psychological fact, nor as an act or accident of some previously existing substance or being. It is an action of the I, but one that is identical with the very existence of this same I. In Fichte's technical terminology, the original unity of self-consciousness is to be understood both as an action and as the product of the same I, as a \"fact and/or act\" (''Thathandlung''; [[Modern German]]: ''Tathandlung''), a unity that is presupposed by and contained within every fact and every act of empirical consciousness, although it never appears as such therein.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe I must posit itself in order to be an I at all; but it can posit itself only insofar as it posits itself as limited. Moreover, it cannot even posit for itself its own limitations, in the sense of producing or creating these limits. The finite I cannot be the ground of its own passivity. Instead, for Fichte, if the I is to posit itself off at all, it must simply discover itself to be limited, a discovery that Fichte characterizes as an \"impulse,\"<ref>Breazeale 2013, p. vii.</ref> \"repulse,\"<ref>Nicholas Adams, George Pattison, Graham Ward (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Theology and Modern European Thought'', Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 129.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> or \"resistance\"<ref>Jeffrey Reid, ''The Anti-Romantic: Hegel Against Ironic Romanticism'', A&C Black, 2014, p. 26.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> (''Anstoss''; Modern German: ''[[wikt:Ansto\u00df|Ansto\u00df]]'') to the free practical activity of the I. Such an original limitation of the I is, however, a limit for the I only insofar as the I posits it out as a limit. The I does this, according to Fichte's analysis, by positing its own limitation, first, as only a feeling, then as a sensation, then as an intuition of a thing, and finally as a summons of another person. \n\nThe ''Anstoss'' thus provides the essential impetus that first posits in motion the entire complex train of activities that finally result in our conscious experience both of ourselves and others as empirical individuals and of the world around us. Although ''Anstoss'' plays a similar role as the [[thing in itself]] does in [[Kantian]] philosophy, unlike Kant, Fichte's ''Anstoss'' is not something foreign to the I. Instead, it denotes the original encounter of the I with its own finitude. Rather than claim that the not-I (''das Nicht-Ich'') is the cause or ground of the ''Anstoss'', Fichte argues that not-I is posited by the I precisely in order to explain to itself the ''Anstoss'', that is, in order to become conscious of ''Anstoss''. The ''Wissenschaftslehre'' demonstrates that such an ''Anstoss'' must occur if self-consciousness is to come about but is unable to deduce or to explain the actual occurrence of such an ''Anstoss'' \u2014 except as a condition for the possibility of consciousness. Accordingly, there are strict limits to what can be expected from any a priori deduction of experience, and this limitation, for Fichte, equally applies to Kant's transcendental philosophy.{{cn|date=January 2019}} According to Fichte, transcendental philosophy can explain that the world must have space, time, and causality, but it can never explain why objects have the particular sensible properties they happen to have or why I am this determinate individual rather than another. This is something that the I simply has to discover at the same time that it discovers its own freedom, and indeed, as a condition for the latter.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n[[Dieter Henrich]] (1966) proposed that Fichte was able to move beyond a \"reflective theory of consciousness\". According to Fichte, the self must already have some prior acquaintance with itself, independent of the act of reflection (\"no object comes to consciousness except under the condition that I am aware of myself, the conscious subject [''jedes Object kommt zum Bewusstseyn lediglich unter der Bedingung, dass ich auch meiner selbst, des bewusstseyenden Subjects mir bewusst sey'']\").<ref>Fichte, J. G., ''Versuch einer neuen Darstellung der Wissenschaftslehre'' (1797/1798): II.2; ''Gesamtausgabe'' I/4:274\u2013275.</ref> This idea is what Henrich called [[Fichte's original insight]].<ref name=\"Henrich\">[[Dieter Henrich]], \"Fichte's Original Insight\", ''Contemporary German Philosophy'' 1 (1982 [1966]), ed. by Darrel E.

Consequently, Fichte came to believe Germany would be responsible to carry the virtues of the French Revolution into the future. Furthermore, his nationalism was not aroused by Prussian military defeat and humiliation, for these had not yet occurred, but resulted from devotion to his own humanitarian philosophy. Through disappointment in the French he turned to the German nation as the instrument of fulfilling it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Eugene |title=Nationalism and the Culture Crisis in Prussia: 1806-1815 |year=1966 |publisher=Octagon Press |page=29}}</ref>\n\nThese lectures, entitled the ''Addresses to the German Nation'', coincided with a period of reform in the Prussian government, under the chancellorship of [[Baron vom Stein]]. The ''Addresses'' display Fichte's interest during that period in language and culture as vehicles of human spiritual development. Fichte built upon the earlier ideas of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and attempted to unite them with his more systematic approach. The aim of the German nation, according to Fichte, was to \"found an empire of spirit and reason, and to annihilate completely the crude physical force that rules of the world.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |last=Fichte |first=Johann Gottlieb |title=Addresses to the German Nation |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=496}}</ref> Like Herder's German nationalism, Fichte's was wholly cultural, and grounded in the aesthetic, literary, and moral.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Allen |title=Fichte's Ethical Thought |year=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=25}}</ref>\n\nThe nationalism propounded by Fichte in the ''Addresses'' would be appealed to over a century later by the Nazi Party in Germany, which sought in Fichte a forerunner to its own nationalist ideology. Like [[Nietzsche]], the association of Fichte with the Nazi regime came to colour readings of Fichte's German nationalism in the post-war period.<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Rohan |title=The Roots of National Socialism |year=1941 |publisher=Faber & Faber |page=38\u201339}}</ref> This reading of Fichte was often bolstered through reference to an unpublished letter from 1793, ''Contributions to the Correction of the Public's Judgment concerning the French Revolution'', wherein Fichte expressed anti-semitic sentiments, such as arguing against extending civil rights to Jews and calling them a \"state within a state\" that could \"undermine\" the German nation.<ref name=\"Gesamtausgabe I/1 pp. 292\">''Gesamtausgabe'', I/1, pp. 292\u201393</ref> \n\nHowever, attached to the letter is a footnote in which Fichte provides an impassioned plea for permitting Jews to practice their religion without hindrance.

Solomon]], ''In the Spirit of Hegel'', Oxford University Press, p. 23.</ref> Like [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Descartes]] and Kant before him, Fichte was motivated by the problem of [[subjectivity]] and [[consciousness]]. Fichte also wrote works of [[political philosophy]]; he has a reputation as one of the fathers of [[German nationalism]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Origins===\nFichte was born in [[Rammenau]], [[Upper Lusatia]]. The son of a ribbon weaver,<ref name=\"nie\">{{cite NIE|wstitle=Fichte, Johann Gottlieb|year=1905}}</ref> he came of peasant stock which had lived in the region for many generations. The family was noted in the neighborhood for its probity and piety. Christian Fichte, Johann Gottlieb's father, married somewhat above his station. It has been suggested that a certain impatience which Fichte himself displayed throughout his life was an inheritance from his mother.<ref name=\"americana\"/>\n\nHe received the rudiments of his education from his father. He showed remarkable ability from an early age, and it was owing to his reputation among the villagers that he gained the opportunity for a better education than he otherwise would have received. The story runs that the Freiherr von Militz, a country landowner, arrived too late to hear the local pastor preach. He was, however, informed that a lad in the neighborhood would be able to repeat the sermon almost ''verbatim''. As a result, the baron took the lad into his protection, which meant that he paid his tuition.<ref name=\"americana\">{{cite Americana|wstitle=Fichte, Johann Gottlieb|year=1920}}</ref>\n\n===Early schooling===\nFichte was placed in the family of Pastor Krebel at [[Niederau]] near [[Meissen]], and there received a thorough grounding in the [[classics]]. From this time onward, Fichte saw little of his parents. In October 1774, he was attending the celebrated foundation-school at [[Pforta]] near [[Naumburg]]. This school is associated with the names of [[Novalis]], [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]], [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. The spirit of the institution was semi-monastic and, while the education given was excellent in its way, it is doubtful whether there was enough social life and contact with the world for a pupil of Fichte's temperament and antecedents. Perhaps his education strengthened a tendency toward introspection and independence, characteristics which appear strongly in his doctrines and writings.<ref name=\"americana\"/>\n\n===Theological studies and private tutoring===\nIn 1780, he began study at the theology seminary of the [[University of Jena]]. He was transferred a year later to study at the [[Leipzig University]]. Fichte seems to have supported himself at this period of bitter poverty and hard struggle.<ref name=\"americana\"/> Freiherr von Militz continued to support him, but when he died in 1784, Fichte had to end his studies prematurely, without completing his degree.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Breazeale |first1=Daniel |last2=Fichte |first2=Johann |title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=2}}<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nDuring the years 1784 to 1788, he supported himself in a precarious way as tutor in various Saxon families.<ref name=\"nie\"/> In early 1788, he returned to [[Leipzig]] in the hope of finding a better employment, but eventually he had to settle for a much less promising position with the family of an innkeeper in [[Zurich]].<ref>Anthony J.

While he was assimilating the Kantian philosophy and preparing to develop it, fate dealt him a blow: the Rahn family had suffered financial reverses, and his impending marriage had to be postponed.<ref name=\"americana\"/>\n\n===Kant===\nFrom Zurich, Fichte returned to Leipzig in May 1790.<ref name=\"La Vopa 151\"/> In the spring of 1791, he obtained a tutorship at [[Warsaw]] in the house of a [[Polish people|Polish]] nobleman. The situation, however, quickly proved disagreeable and he was released. He then got a chance to see Kant at [[K\u00f6nigsberg]]. After a disappointing interview on July 4 of the same year,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Breazeale |first1=Daniel |last2=Fichte |first2=Johann |title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings |date=1993 |publisher=Cornell University Press |page=7}}</ref> he shut himself in his lodgings and threw all his energies into the composition of an essay which would compel Kant's attention and interest. This essay, completed in five weeks, was the ''Versuch einer Critik<!--[sic]--> aller Offenbarung'' (''[[Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation]]'', 1792).<ref name=\"americana\"/> In this book, according to Henrich, Fichte investigated the connections between divine revelation and Kant's [[critical philosophy]]. The first edition of the book was published without Kant's or Fichte's knowledge, moreover without Fichte's name or signed preface. It was thus mistakenly thought to be a new work by Kant himself.<ref>Traditionally, it has been assumed that either the omission was an accident or a deliberate attempt by the publisher to move copies. In either case, Fichte did not plan it and in fact only heard of the accident much later. He writes to his fianc\u00e9e: \"Why did I have to have such utterly strange, excellent, unheard-of good luck?\" See Garrett Green's Introduction to ''Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978.</ref> \n\nReviews were assuming Kant was the author when Kant cleared the confusion and openly praised the work and author. Fichte's reputation skyrocketed as many intellectuals of the day were of the opinion that it was \"the most shocking and astonishing news... [since] nobody but Kant could have written this book. This amazing news of a third sun in the philosophical heavens has set me into such confusion\".<ref>Letter from Jens Baggeson to Karl Reinhold.

Vol 2, p 266.</ref> Kant waited seven years to make public statement about the incident; after considerable external pressure he dissociated himself from Fichte. In his statement, he inscribed, \"May God protect us from our friends. From our enemies, we can try to protect ourselves.\"<ref>Popper, Karl. \"The Open Society and Its Enemies.\" Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. Vol 2, p 266.<!--ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>\n\n===Jena===\nIn October 1793, he was married in Zurich, where he remained the rest of the year. Stirred by the events and principles of the [[French Revolution]], he wrote and anonymously published two pamphlets which led to him being seen as a devoted defender of liberty of thought and action and an advocate of political changes. In December of the same year, he received an invitation to fill the position of extraordinary professor of philosophy at the [[University of Jena]]. He accepted and began his lectures in May of the next year. With extraordinary zeal, he expounded his system of \"[[transcendental idealism]]\". His success was immediate. He seems to have excelled as a lecturer because of the earnestness and force of his personality. These lectures were later published under the title ''The Vocation of the Scholar'' (''Einige Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Bestimmung des Gelehrten''). He gave himself up to intense production, and a succession of works soon appeared.<ref name=\"nie\"/><ref name=\"americana\"/>\n\n===Atheism dispute===\n{{main|Atheism dispute}}\nAfter weathering a couple of academic storms, he was finally dismissed from Jena in 1799 as a result of a charge of atheism. He was accused of this in 1798, after publishing his essay \"Ueber<!--[sic]--> den Grund unsers<!--[sic]--> Glaubens an eine g\u00f6ttliche Weltregierung\" (\"On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance\"), which he had written in response to [[Friedrich Karl Forberg]]'s essay \"Development of the Concept of Religion\", in his ''Philosophical Journal''. For Fichte, God should be conceived primarily in moral terms: \"The living and efficaciously acting moral order is itself God. We require no other God, nor can we grasp any other\" (\"On the Ground of Our Belief in a Divine World-Governance\"). Fichte's intemperate \"Appeal to the Public\" (\"Appellation an das Publikum\", 1799) provoked [[F. H. Jacobi]] to publish an [[open letter]] to him, in which he equated philosophy in general and Fichte's [[transcendental philosophy]] in particular with [[nihilism]].<ref name=SEP/>\n\n===Berlin===\nSince all the German states except Prussia had joined in the cry against Fichte, he was forced to go to Berlin. There he associated himself with the Schlegels, [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Ludwig Tieck|Tieck]].<ref name=\"americana\"/> In April 1800, through the introduction of Hungarian writer [[Ignaz Aurelius Fessler]], he was initiated into [[Freemasonry]] in the Lodge Pythagoras of the Blazing Star where he was elected minor warden. At first Fichte was a warm admirer of Fessler, and was disposed to aid him in his proposed Masonic reform. But later he became Fessler's bitter opponent. Their controversy attracted much attention among Freemasons.<ref name=\"Mackey\">{{cite book|journal=Mackey's National Freemason|title=Fichte as a Freemason: October 1872 to September 1873|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ip5bF1xtRB0C&pg=PA430|page=430|date=2003|editor=Albert G.

Briefe an Konstant''), where Konstant referred to a fictitious non-Mason.<ref name=\"Magee 55\"/>\n\nIn November 1800, Fichte published ''The Closed Commercial State: A Philosophical Sketch as an Appendix to the Doctrine of Right and an Example of a Future Politics'' (''Der geschlossene Handelsstaat. Ein philosophischer Entwurf als Anhang zur Rechtslehre und Probe einer k\u00fcnftig zu liefernden Politik''), a philosophical statement of his property theory, a historical analysis of European economic relations, and a political proposal for reforming them.<ref>Isaac Nakhimovsky, ''The Closed Commercial State: Perpetual Peace and Commercial Society from Rousseau to Fichte'', Princeton University Press, 2011, p. 6.</ref> In 1805, he was appointed to a professorship at the  [[University of Erlangen]].

By the votes of his colleagues Fichte was unanimously elected its rector in the succeeding year. But, once more, his impetuosity and reforming zeal led to friction, and he resigned in 1812. The campaign against Napoleon began, and the hospitals at Berlin were soon full of patients. Fichte's wife devoted herself to nursing and caught a virulent fever. Just as she was recovering, he himself was stricken down. He died of [[typhus]] at the age of 51.<ref name=\"nie\"/><ref name=\"americana\"/> \n\nHis son, [[Immanuel Hermann Fichte]] (18 July 1796 \u2013 8 August 1879), also made contributions to [[philosophy]].\n\n==Philosophical work==\nIn mimicking Kant's difficult style, his critics argued that Fichte produced works that were barely intelligible. \"He made no hesitation in pluming himself on his great skill in the shadowy and obscure, by often remarking to his pupils, that 'there was only one man in the world who could fully understand his writings; and even he was often at a loss to seize upon his real meaning.'\"<ref>Robert Blakely, ''History of the Philosophy of Mind'', Vol. IV, p. 114, London: Longmans, 1850</ref> On the other hand, Fichte himself acknowledged the difficulty of his writings, but argued that his works were clear and transparent to those who made the effort to think without preconceptions and prejudices.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nFichte did not endorse Kant's argument for the existence of [[noumenon|noumena]], of \"things in themselves\", the supra-sensible reality beyond the categories of direct human perception. Fichte saw the rigorous and [[system]]atic separation of \"things in themselves\" ([[noumenon|noumena]]) and things \"as they appear to us\" ([[phenomenon|phenomena]]) as an invitation to [[skepticism]]. Rather than invite such skepticism, Fichte made the radical suggestion that we should throw out the notion of a noumenal world and instead accept the fact that [[consciousness]] does not have a grounding in a so-called \"real world\". In fact, Fichte achieved fame for originating the argument that consciousness is not grounded in ''anything'' outside of itself. The phenomenal world as such, arises from self-consciousness; the activity of the ego; and moral awareness. His student (and critic), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], wrote:{{Quotation|Fichte who, because the [[thing-in-itself]] had just been discredited, at once prepared a system without any thing-in-itself. Consequently, he rejected the assumption of anything that was not through and through merely our [[Representation (psychology)|representation]], and therefore let the knowing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] be all in all or at any rate produce everything from its own resources. For this purpose, he at once did away with the essential and most meritorious part of the [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian doctrine, the distinction between ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' and thus that between the [[phenomenon]] and the thing-in-itself. For he declared everything to be ''a priori'', naturally without any evidence for such a monstrous assertion; instead of these, he gave sophisms and even crazy sham demonstrations whose absurdity was concealed under the mask of profundity and of the incomprehensibility ostensibly arising therefrom. Moreover, he appealed boldly and openly to [[intellectual]] [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], that is, really to [[Invention|inspiration]].|Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, \u00a713}}\n\n[[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] was also a student of the writings of Fichte:{{Quotation|Our whole age is imbued with a formal striving. This is what led us to disregard congeniality and to emphasize symmetrical beauty, to prefer conventional rather than sincere social relations. It is this whole striving which is denoted by \u2014 to use the words of another author \u2014 Fichte's and the other philosophers' attempts to construct systems by sharpness of mind and Robespierre's attempt to do it with the help of the guillotine; it is this which meets us in the flowing butterfly verses of our poets and in Auber's music, and finally, it is this which produces the many revolutions in the political world. I agree perfectly with this whole effort to cling to form, insofar as it continues to be the medium through which we have the idea, but it should not be forgotten that it is the idea which should determine the form, not the form which determines the idea. We should keep in mind that life is not something abstract but something extremely individual. We should not forget that, for example, from a poetic genius' position of immediacy, form is nothing but the coming into existence of the idea in the world, and that the task of reflection is only to investigate whether or not the idea has gotten the properly corresponding form. Form is not the basis of life, but life is the basis of form. Imagine that a man long infatuated with the Greek mode of life had acquired the means to arrange for a building in the Greek style and a Grecian household establishment \u2014 whether or not he would be satisfied would be highly problematical, or would he soon prefer another form simply because he had not sufficiently tested himself and the system in which he lived. But just as a leap backward is wrong (something the age, on the whole, is inclined to acknowledge), so also a leap forward is wrong \u2014 both of them because a natural development does not proceed by leaps, and life's earnestness will ironize over every such experiment, even if it succeeds momentarily.|S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, ''Journals'', \"Our Journalistic Literature\", 28 November 1835.<ref>[http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Kierkegaard,Soren/JournPapers/I_B.html Journals and Papers of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, 1B]</ref>}}\n\n===Central theory===\n{{refimprove|section|date=May 2017}}\nIn his work ''[[Foundations of Natural Right]]'' (1797), Fichte argued that [[self-awareness|self-consciousness]] was a social phenomenon \u2014 an important step and perhaps the first clear step taken in this direction by modern philosophy. A necessary condition of every subject's self-awareness, for Fichte, is the existence of other rational subjects. These others call or summon (''fordern auf'') the subject or self out of its unconsciousness and into an awareness of itself as a free individual.<ref>{{cite web|title=Foundations of Natural Right|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/96398724/Fichte-Foundations-of-Natural-Right-1797|website=Scribd|accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nFichte's account proceeds from the general principle that the I (''das Ich'') must posit itself as an individual in order to posit (''setzen'') itself at all, and that in order to posit itself as an individual it must recognize itself as it were to a calling or summons (''Aufforderung'') by other free individual(s) \u2014 called, moreover, to limit its own freedom out of respect for the freedom of the other. The same condition applied and applies, of course, to the other(s) in its development. Hence, mutual recognition (''gegenseitig anerkennen'') of rational individuals turns out to be a condition necessary for the individual I in general.<ref>Fichte, J. G. (2000), ''Foundations of Natural Right, according to the Principles of the Wissenschaftslehre'', ed. F. Neuhouser, trans. M. Baur. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 42.</ref><ref>[[Allen W. Wood]], ''The Free Development of Each: Studies on Reason, Right, and Ethics in Classical German Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 207: \"The whole point of the summons, in fact, is that it is what first makes our individuality possible for us, through presenting us with the concept of our own individual free action in the form of an object of our consciousness.\"</ref> This argument for [[intersubjectivity]] is central to the conception of selfhood developed in the ''[[Foundations of the Science of Knowledge]]''<ref>Also translated as ''Foundations of the Entire Science of Knowledge''.</ref> (''Grundlage der gesamten<!--[sic]--> Wissenschaftslehre'', 1794/1795). \n\nIn Fichte's view consciousness of the self depends upon resistance or a check by something that is understood as not part of the self yet is not immediately ascribable to a particular sensory perception. In his later 1796\u201399 lectures (his ''Nova methodo''), Fichte incorporated it into his revised presentation of the very foundations of his system, where the summons takes its place alongside original feeling, which takes the place of the earlier ''Anstoss'' (see below) as both a limit upon the absolute freedom of the I and a condition for the positing of the same.\n\nThe I itself posits this situation for itself. To posit does not mean to 'create' the objects of consciousness. The principle in question simply states that the essence of an I lies in the assertion of one's own self-identity, i.e., that consciousness presupposes self-consciousness. Such immediate self-identity, however, cannot be understood as a psychological fact, nor as an act or accident of some previously existing substance or being. It is an action of the I, but one that is identical with the very existence of this same I. In Fichte's technical terminology, the original unity of self-consciousness is to be understood both as an action and as the product of the same I, as a \"fact and/or act\" (''Thathandlung''; [[Modern German]]: ''Tathandlung''), a unity that is presupposed by and contained within every fact and every act of empirical consciousness, although it never appears as such therein.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe I must posit itself in order to be an I at all; but it can posit itself only insofar as it posits itself as limited. Moreover, it cannot even posit for itself its own limitations, in the sense of producing or creating these limits. The finite I cannot be the ground of its own passivity. Instead, for Fichte, if the I is to posit itself off at all, it must simply discover itself to be limited, a discovery that Fichte characterizes as an \"impulse,\"<ref>Breazeale 2013, p. vii.</ref> \"repulse,\"<ref>Nicholas Adams, George Pattison, Graham Ward (eds.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Theology and Modern European Thought'', Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 129.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> or \"resistance\"<ref>Jeffrey Reid, ''The Anti-Romantic: Hegel Against Ironic Romanticism'', A&C Black, 2014, p. 26.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> (''Anstoss''; Modern German: ''[[wikt:Ansto\u00df|Ansto\u00df]]'') to the free practical activity of the I. Such an original limitation of the I is, however, a limit for the I only insofar as the I posits it out as a limit. The I does this, according to Fichte's analysis, by positing its own limitation, first, as only a feeling, then as a sensation, then as an intuition of a thing, and finally as a summons of another person. \n\nThe ''Anstoss'' thus provides the essential impetus that first posits in motion the entire complex train of activities that finally result in our conscious experience both of ourselves and others as empirical individuals and of the world around us. Although ''Anstoss'' plays a similar role as the [[thing in itself]] does in [[Kantian]] philosophy, unlike Kant, Fichte's ''Anstoss'' is not something foreign to the I. Instead, it denotes the original encounter of the I with its own finitude. Rather than claim that the not-I (''das Nicht-Ich'') is the cause or ground of the ''Anstoss'', Fichte argues that not-I is posited by the I precisely in order to explain to itself the ''Anstoss'', that is, in order to become conscious of ''Anstoss''. The ''Wissenschaftslehre'' demonstrates that such an ''Anstoss'' must occur if self-consciousness is to come about but is unable to deduce or to explain the actual occurrence of such an ''Anstoss'' \u2014 except as a condition for the possibility of consciousness. Accordingly, there are strict limits to what can be expected from any a priori deduction of experience, and this limitation, for Fichte, equally applies to Kant's transcendental philosophy.{{cn|date=January 2019}} According to Fichte, transcendental philosophy can explain that the world must have space, time, and causality, but it can never explain why objects have the particular sensible properties they happen to have or why I am this determinate individual rather than another. This is something that the I simply has to discover at the same time that it discovers its own freedom, and indeed, as a condition for the latter.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n[[Dieter Henrich]] (1966) proposed that Fichte was able to move beyond a \"reflective theory of consciousness\". According to Fichte, the self must already have some prior acquaintance with itself, independent of the act of reflection (\"no object comes to consciousness except under the condition that I am aware of myself, the conscious subject [''jedes Object kommt zum Bewusstseyn lediglich unter der Bedingung, dass ich auch meiner selbst, des bewusstseyenden Subjects mir bewusst sey'']\").<ref>Fichte, J. G., ''Versuch einer neuen Darstellung der Wissenschaftslehre'' (1797/1798): II.2; ''Gesamtausgabe'' I/4:274\u2013275.</ref> This idea is what Henrich called [[Fichte's original insight]].<ref name=\"Henrich\">[[Dieter Henrich]], \"Fichte's Original Insight\", ''Contemporary German Philosophy'' 1 (1982 [1966]), ed. by Darrel E. Christensen ''et al.'', pp. 15\u201352 (translation of Henrich, Dieter (1966), \"Fichtes urspr\u00fcngliche Einsicht\", in: ''Subjektivit\u00e4t und Metaphysik. Festschrift f\u00fcr Wolfgang Cramer'' edited by D. Henrich und H. Wagner, Frankfurt/M., pp. 188\u2013232). Henrich's article is an analysis of the following three presentations of the ''[[Gnosology|Wissenschaftslehre]]'': ''[[Foundations of the Science of Knowledge|Grundlage der gesamten<!--[sic]--> Wissenschaftslehre]]'' (''Foundations of the Science of Knowledge'', 1794/1795), ''Versuch einer neuen Darstellung der Wissenschaftslehre'' (''An Attempt a New Presentation of the Wissenschaftslehre'', 1797/1798), and ''Darstellung der Wissenschaftslehre'' (''Presentation of the Wissenschaftslehre'', 1801).</ref>\n\n===Nationalism===\nBetween December 1807 and March 1808, Fichte gave a series of lectures concerning the \"German nation\" and its culture and language, projecting the kind of national education he hoped would raise it from the humiliation of its defeat at the hands of the French. <ref>{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Allen |title=Fichte's Ethical Thought |year=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=25}}</ref> Having been a supporter of Revolutionary France, Fichte became disenchanted by 1804 as Napoleon's armies advanced through Europe, occupying German territories, stripping them of their raw materials and subjugating them to foreign rule. Consequently, Fichte came to believe Germany would be responsible to carry the virtues of the French Revolution into the future. Furthermore, his nationalism was not aroused by Prussian military defeat and humiliation, for these had not yet occurred, but resulted from devotion to his own humanitarian philosophy. Through disappointment in the French he turned to the German nation as the instrument of fulfilling it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Eugene |title=Nationalism and the Culture Crisis in Prussia: 1806-1815 |year=1966 |publisher=Octagon Press |page=29}}</ref>\n\nThese lectures, entitled the ''Addresses to the German Nation'', coincided with a period of reform in the Prussian government, under the chancellorship of [[Baron vom Stein]]. The ''Addresses'' display Fichte's interest during that period in language and culture as vehicles of human spiritual development. Fichte built upon the earlier ideas of [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] and attempted to unite them with his more systematic approach. The aim of the German nation, according to Fichte, was to \"found an empire of spirit and reason, and to annihilate completely the crude physical force that rules of the world.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |last=Fichte |first=Johann Gottlieb |title=Addresses to the German Nation |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=496}}</ref> Like Herder's German nationalism, Fichte's was wholly cultural, and grounded in the aesthetic, literary, and moral.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Allen |title=Fichte's Ethical Thought |year=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=25}}</ref>\n\nThe nationalism propounded by Fichte in the ''Addresses'' would be appealed to over a century later by the Nazi Party in Germany, which sought in Fichte a forerunner to its own nationalist ideology. Like [[Nietzsche]], the association of Fichte with the Nazi regime came to colour readings of Fichte's German nationalism in the post-war period.<ref>{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Rohan |title=The Roots of National Socialism |year=1941 |publisher=Faber & Faber |page=38\u201339}}</ref> This reading of Fichte was often bolstered through reference to an unpublished letter from 1793, ''Contributions to the Correction of the Public's Judgment concerning the French Revolution'', wherein Fichte expressed anti-semitic sentiments, such as arguing against extending civil rights to Jews and calling them a \"state within a state\" that could \"undermine\" the German nation.<ref name=\"Gesamtausgabe I/1 pp. 292\">''Gesamtausgabe'', I/1, pp. 292\u201393</ref> \n\nHowever, attached to the letter is a footnote in which Fichte provides an impassioned plea for permitting Jews to practice their religion without hindrance. Furthermore, the final act of Fichte's academic career was to resign as rector of the University of Berlin in protest when his colleagues refused to punish the harassment of Jewish students.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Allen |title=Fichte's Ethical Thought |year=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=27}}</ref> While recent scholarship has sought to dissociate Fichte's writings on nationalism with his adoption by the Nazi Party, the association continues to blight his legacy,<ref>{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Allen |title=Fichte's Ethical Thought |year=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=26}}</ref> although Fichte, as if to exclude all ground of doubt, clearly and distinctly prohibits \u2014&nbsp;in his reworked version of ''The Science of Ethics as Based on the Science of Knowledge'' (see [[#Final period in Berlin|\u00a7 Final period in Berlin]])&nbsp;\u2014 genocide and other crimes against humanity:\n: If you say that it is your conscience's command to exterminate peoples for their sins, [\u2026] we can confidently tell you that you are wrong; for such things can never be commanded against the free and moral force.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lauth |first=Reinhard |author-link=Reinhard Lauth |title=Abraham und die Kinder seines Bundes mit Gott |trans-title=[[Abraham]] and the children of his [[Covenant of the pieces|Covenant]] with God |chapter-url=http://www.christoph-heger.de/Lauth_08.PDF |language=de |location=M\u00fcnchen |publisher=[[Christian Jerrentrup]] Verlag |pages=243\u2013292, here: p. 273 |chapter=8.

His mystic work ''The Way Towards the Blessed Life'' (''Die Anweisung zum seligen Leben oder auch die Religionslehre'') gave his fullest thoughts on religion.

Other tribes also lived in areas that today form the metropolitan region.\n\nThe region was divided in Caciquedoms (chiefdoms) at the time of encounter with the Europeans. The most notable Cacique was Tibiri\u00e7a, known for his support for the Portuguese and other European colonists. Among the many indigenous names that survive today are Tiet\u00ea, Ipiranga, Tamanduate\u00ed, Anhangaba\u00fa, Piratininga, Itaquaquecetuba, Cotia, Itapevi, Barueri, Embu-Gua\u00e7u etc...<!-- Places, people or both? -->\n\n===Colonial period===\n[[File:Ant\u00f4nio Parreiras - Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de S\u00e3o Paulo, 1913.jpg|thumb|''Founding of S\u00e3o Paulo'', 1913 painting by Antonio Parreiras]]\n[[File:P\u00e1tio do Col\u00e9gio in S\u00e3o Paulo.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of the College, ''P\u00e1tio do Col\u00e9gio'', in the Historic Center of S\u00e3o Paulo.

The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college of twelve priests included Manuel da N\u00f3brega and Spanish priest [[Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta]]. They built a mission on top of a steep hill between the [[Anhangaba\u00fa River|Anhangaba\u00fa]] and [[Tamanduate\u00ed River|Tamanduate\u00ed]] rivers.<ref name=\"Lawrence183\">[[#Lawrence69|Rachel Lawrence]]: 2010, p. 183</ref>\n\nThey first had a small structure built of rammed earth, made by American Indian workers in their traditional style. The priests wanted to evangelize \u2013 teach ([[catechesis]]) the Indians who lived in the Plateau region of Piratininga and convert them to Christianity. The site was separated from the coast by the [[Serra do Mar]], called by the Indians ''Serra Paranapiacaba.''\n\nThe college was named for a Christian saint and its founding on the feast day of the celebration of the conversion of the Apostle [[Paul of Tarsus]]. Father Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta wrote this account in a letter to the Society of Jesus:\n\n{{quote|The settlement of the region's Courtyard of the College began in 1560. During the visit of Mem de S\u00e1, Governor-General of Brazil, the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente, he ordered the transfer of the population of the Village of Santo Andr\u00e9 da Borda do Campo to the vicinity of the college. It was then named \"College of St. Paul Piratininga\". The new location was on a steep hill adjacent to a large wetland, the lowland do Carmo. It offered better protection from attacks by local Indian groups. It was renamed Vila de S\u00e3o Paulo, belonging to the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente.}}\n\nFor the next two centuries, S\u00e3o Paulo developed as a poor and isolated village that survived largely through the cultivation of [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence crops]] by the labor of natives. For a long time, S\u00e3o Paulo was the only village in Brazil's interior, as travel was too difficult for many to reach the area. Mem de S\u00e1 forbade colonists to use the \"Path Piraiqu\u00ea\" (Pia\u00e7aguera today), because of frequent Indian raids along it.\n\nOn March 22, 1681, the Marquis de Cascais, the donee of the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente, moved the capital to the village of St. Paul, designating it the \"Head of the captaincy\". The new capital was established on April 23, 1683, with public celebrations.\n\n====The Bandeirantes====\n{{Main|Bandeirantes}}\n[[File:Sao Paulo - Monumento \u00e0s Bandeiras - foto Carlos Alkmin nr 07-13 4282b.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Monument to the Bandeiras]] commemorates the 17th-century ''[[bandeiras]]'']]\n\nIn the 17th century, S\u00e3o Paulo was one of the poorest regions of the Portuguese colony. It was also the center of interior colonial development. Because they were extremely poor, the Paulistas could not afford to buy [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]], as did other Portuguese colonists. The discovery of gold in the region of [[Minas Gerais]], in the 1690s, brought attention and new settlers to S\u00e3o Paulo. The Captaincy of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas do Ouro was created on November 3, 1709, when the Portuguese crown purchased the Captaincies of S\u00e3o Paulo and Santo Amaro from the former grantees.\n\nConveniently located in the country, up the steep ''[[Serra do Mar]]'' sea ridge when traveling from [[Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo|Santos]], while also not too far from the coastline, S\u00e3o Paulo became a safe place to stay for tired travellers. The town became a centre for the ''[[bandeirantes]]'', intrepid explorers who marched into unknown lands in search for gold, diamonds, precious stones, and Indians to enslave.\n[[File:Domingos Jorge Velho.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Domingos Jorge Velho]], a notable ''bandeirante''.]]\n\nThe ''bandeirantes'', which could be translated as \"flag-bearers\" or \"flag-followers\", organized excursions into the land with the primary purpose of profit and the expansion of territory for the Portuguese crown. Trade grew from the local markets and from providing food and accommodation for explorers. The ''bandeirantes'' eventually became politically powerful as a group, and forced the expulsion of the [[Jesuit]]s from the city of S\u00e3o Paulo in 1640. The two groups had frequently come into conflict because of the Jesuits' opposition to the domestic [[slave trade]] in Indians.\n\nOn July 11, 1711, the town of S\u00e3o Paulo was elevated to city status. Around the 1720s, gold was found by the pioneers in the regions near what are now Cuiab\u00e1 and Goiania. The Portuguese expanded their Brazilian territory beyond the [[Tordesillas Line]] to incorporate the gold regions.\n\nWhen the gold ran out in the late 18th century, S\u00e3o Paulo shifted to growing [[sugar cane]]. Cultivation of this commodity crop spread through the interior of the Captaincy. The sugar was exported through the [[Port of Santos]]. At that time, the first modern highway between S\u00e3o Paulo and the coast was constructed and named the Walk of Lorraine.\n\nNowadays, the estate that is home to the Governor of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, located in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, is called the ''Pal\u00e1cio dos Bandeirantes'' (Palace of Bandeirantes), in the neighbourhood of Morumbi.\n\n===Imperial Period===\n{{Main|Empire of Brazil}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| total_width = 400\n| image1 = Monumento \u00e0 Independ\u00eancia 02.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Monument to the Independence of Brazil|Monument to Independence]] in Independence Park, located at the place where then-[[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]] proclaimed the [[independence of Brazil]]\n| image2 = Marc Ferrez - IMS 002001MF005003.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = [[Pra\u00e7a da S\u00e9|Cathedral Square of S\u00e3o Paulo]] in 1880, during the reign of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]] by [[Marc Ferrez (photographer)|Marc Ferrez]].\n| footer = \n}}\n\nAfter Brazil became independent from Portugal in 1822, as declared by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro I]] where the Monument of Ipiranga is located, he named S\u00e3o Paulo as an Imperial City. In 1827, a law school was founded at the Convent of S\u00e3o Francisco, today part of the [[University of S\u00e3o Paulo]]. The influx of students and teachers gave a new impetus to the city's growth, thanks to which the city became the ''Imperial City and Borough of Students of St. Paul of Piratininga''.\n\nThe expansion of [[Coffee production in Brazil|coffee production]] was a major factor in the growth of S\u00e3o Paulo, as it became the region's chief export crop and yielded good revenue. It was cultivated initially in the Vale do Para\u00edba (''Para\u00edba Valley'') region in the East of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, and later on in the regions of Campinas, Rio Claro, S\u00e3o Carlos and Ribeir\u00e3o Preto.\n\nFrom 1869 onwards, S\u00e3o Paulo was connected to the port of Santos by the Railroad Santos-Jundia\u00ed, nicknamed'' The Lady''. In the late 19th century, several other railroads connected the interior to the state capital. S\u00e3o Paulo became the point of convergence of all railroads from the interior of the state. Coffee was the economic engine for major economic and population growth in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nIn 1888, the \"Golden Law\" (''Lei \u00c1urea'') was sanctioned by [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil]], \nabolishing the institution of slavery in Brazil. Slaves were the main source of labour in the coffee plantations until then. As a consequence of this law, and following governmental stimulus towards the increase of immigration, the province began to receive a large number of immigrants, largely Italians, Japanese and Portuguese peasants, many of whom settled in the capital. The region's first industries also began to emerge, providing jobs to the newcomers, especially those who had to learn Portuguese.\n\n===Old Republican Period===\n[[File:Guilherme Gaensly - Esta\u00e7\u00e3o da Luz, c. 1900.jpg|thumb|[[Luz Station]] in 1900]]\n[[File:Avenida Paulista 1902.jpg|thumb|[[Paulista Avenue]] in 1902]]\n\nBy the time Brazil became a republic on November 15, 1889, coffee exports were still an important part of S\u00e3o Paulo's economy. S\u00e3o Paulo grew strong in the national political scene, taking turns with the also rich state of Minas Gerais in electing Brazilian presidents, an alliance that became known as \"[[Caf\u00e9 com leite politics|coffee and milk]]\", given that Minas Gerais was famous for its dairy produce.\n\nDuring this period, S\u00e3o Paulo went from regional center to national metropolis, becoming industrialized and reaching its first million inhabitants in 1928. Its greatest growth in this period was relative in the 1890s when it doubled its population. The height of the coffee period is represented by the construction of the second [[Esta\u00e7\u00e3o da Luz]] (the present building) at the end of the 19th century and by the [[Paulista Avenue]] in 1900, where they built many mansions.<ref name=\"Prefeitura\">{{cite web|url=http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/portal/a_cidade/historia/index.php?p=4827 |title=Abrindo os trilhos para a locomotiva |date=October 5, 2005 |publisher=Prefeitura de S\u00e3o Paulo |accessdate=March 9, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323070214/http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/portal/a_cidade/historia/index.php?p=4827 |archivedate=March 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nIndustrialization was the economic cycle that followed the coffee plantation model. By the hands of some industrious families, including many immigrants of Italian and Jewish origin, factories began to arise and S\u00e3o Paulo became known for its smoky, foggy air. The cultural scene followed [[modernism|modernist]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] tendencies in fashion at the beginning of the 20th century. Some examples of notable modernist artists are poets [[M\u00e1rio de Andrade]] and [[Oswald de Andrade]], artists [[Anita Malfatti]], [[Tarsila do Amaral]] and [[Lasar Segall]], and sculptor [[Victor Brecheret]]. The [[Modern Art Week]] of 1922 that took place at the [[Theatro Municipal (S\u00e3o Paulo)|Theatro Municipal]] was an event marked by [[avant-garde]] ideas and works of art.

Old factory buildings and warehouses still dot the landscape in neighborhoods such as [[Barra Funda]] and Br\u00e1s. Some cities around S\u00e3o Paulo, such as [[Diadema, S\u00e3o Paulo|Diadema]], [[S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo]], [[Santo Andr\u00e9]], and [[Cubat\u00e3o]] are still heavily industrialized to the present day, with factories producing from cosmetics to chemicals to automobiles.\n{{wide image|Image001_Anhangabau.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|[[:pt:Vale do Anhangaba\u00fa|Anhangaba\u00fa Valley]] in [[Central Zone of S\u00e3o Paulo|Downtown S\u00e3o Paulo]] in 1920}}\n\n===Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932===\n{{main|Constitutionalist Revolution}}\n[[File:S\u00e3o Paulo aviation group in Campo de Marte September 1932.jpg|thumb|left|Group of aviators from S\u00e3o Paulo at [[Campo de Marte Airport]] in September 1932]]\n\nThis \"revolution\" is considered by some historians as the last armed conflict to take place in Brazil's history. On July 9, 1932, the population of S\u00e3o Paulo town rose against a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] by [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] to take the presidential office. The movement grew out of local resentment from the fact that Vargas ruled by decree, unbound by a constitution, in a provisional government. The 1930 coup also affected S\u00e3o Paulo by eroding the autonomy that states enjoyed during the term of the 1891 Constitution and preventing the inauguration of the governor of S\u00e3o Paulo J\u00falio Prestes in the Presidency of the Republic, while simultaneously overthrowing President [[Washington Lu\u00eds]], who was governor of S\u00e3o Paulo from 1920 to 1924. These events marked the end of the Old Republic.\n\nThe uprising commenced on July 9, 1932, after four protesting students were killed by federal government troops on May 23, 1932. On the wake of their deaths, a movement called MMDC (from the initials of the names of each of the four students killed, Martins, Miragaia, Dr\u00e1usio and Camargo) started. A fifth victim, Alvarenga, was also shot that night, but died months later.\n[[File:Passagem_da_Tocha_Ol\u00edmpica_em_SP_(28605512140).jpg|thumb|right|[[Obelisk of S\u00e3o Paulo]], at [[Ibirapuera Park]]]]\n\nIn a few months, the state of S\u00e3o Paulo rebelled against the federal government. Counting on the solidarity of the political elites of two other powerful states, ([[Minas Gerais]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]), the politicians from S\u00e3o Paulo expected a quick war. However, that solidarity was never translated into actual support, and the S\u00e3o Paulo revolt was militarily crushed on October 2, 1932.\n\nIn total, there were 87 days of fighting (July 9 to October 4, 1932 \u2013 with the last two days after the surrender of S\u00e3o Paulo), with a balance of 934 official deaths, though non-official estimates report up to 2,200 dead, and many cities in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo suffered damage due to fighting.\n\nThere is an obelisk in front of [[Ibirapuera Park]] that serves as a memorial to the young men that died for the MMDC. The [[University of S\u00e3o Paulo]]'s Law School also pays homage to the students that died during this period with plaques hung on its arcades.\n\n==Geography==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| total_width = 410\n| image1 = Pico do jaragua aerial 2010.JPG\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Pico do Jaragu\u00e1|Jaragu\u00e1 Peak]] is the highest point in the city, at {{convert|1135|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.picodojaragua.com.br/|title=Pico do Jaragu\u00e1 Mountain Official Website|publisher=Picodojaragua.com.br|accessdate=April 17, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406153234/http://www.picodojaragua.com.br/|archivedate=April 6, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| image2 = Vista de s\u00e3o paulo cantareira.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = [[Cantareira State Park]], part of the [[:pt:Reserva da Biosfera do Cintur\u00e3o Verde de S\u00e3o Paulo|Green Belt Biosphere Reserve]]\n| footer = \n}}\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo is located in [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeastern Brazil]], in southeastern [[S\u00e3o Paulo State]], approximately halfway between [[Curitiba]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]].

According to data from the Map of Violence 2011, published by the Sangari Institute and the Ministry of Justice, the city of S\u00e3o Paulo has the lowest homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants among all Brazilian capitals.\n\n===Social challenges===\n[[File:Parais\u00f3polis_I.jpg|thumb|[[Favela]] of [[Parais\u00f3polis (S\u00e3o Paulo)|Parais\u00f3polis]], in the district of [[Vila Andrade]], with residential buildings in the background.]]\n[[File:Conjunto habitacional em Heli\u00f3polis.jpg|thumb|[[Public housing]] in [[Heli\u00f3polis]].]]\n{{Main|Social issues in Brazil}}\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, S\u00e3o Paulo has been a major economic center in Latin America. During two [[World war|World Wars]] and the [[Great Depression]], coffee exports (from other regions of the state) were critically affected. This led wealthy coffee farmers to invest in industrial activities that turned S\u00e3o Paulo into Brazil's largest industrial hub.\n* [[Crime statistics|Crime rates]] consistently decreased in the 21st century. The citywide homicide rate was 9.0 in 2011, less than half the 22.3 national rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssp.sp.gov.br/noticia/lenoticia.aspx?id=26648|title=Capital reduz homic\u00eddios para 9 a cada 100 mil habitantes|publisher=SSP/SP|date=January 27, 2012|accessdate=January 27, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806210116/http://www.ssp.sp.gov.br/noticia/lenoticia.aspx?id=26648|archivedate=August 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* Air quality<ref>{{cite journal|author=School of Public Health, University of S\u00e3o Paulo|title=Air pollution and children's health in S\u00e3o Paulo (1986\u20131998)|journal=Soc Sci Med|year=2003|volume=57|issue=Dec|pages=2013\u20132022|pmid=14512233|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(03)00068-6}}</ref> has steadily increased during the modern era.\n* The two major rivers crossing the city, [[Tiet\u00ea River|Tiet\u00ea]] and Pinheiros, are highly polluted.

The general language from S\u00e3o Paulo General, or [[Tupi language|Tupi Austral]] (Southern Tupi), was the Tupi-based trade language of what is now S\u00e3o Vicente, S\u00e3o Paulo, and the upper Tiet\u00ea River. In the 17th century it was widely spoken in S\u00e3o Paulo and spread to neighboring regions while in Brazil. From 1750 on, following orders from [[Marquess of Pombal]], Portuguese language was introduced through immigration and consequently taught to children in schools. The original [[Tupi Austral]] language subsequently lost ground to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and eventually became extinct. Due to the large influx of [[Japanese Brazilians|Japanese]], [[German Brazilians|German]], [[Brazilians of Spanish descent|Spanish]], [[Italian Brazilian|Italian]] and [[Arab Brazilian|Arab]] immigrants etc., the Portuguese idiom spoken in the metropolitan area of S\u00e3o Paulo reflects influences from those languages. Due to globalization, English is now spoken by some residents as a foreign language.\n[[File:Interior do Museu da L\u00edngua Portuguesa em S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil.jpg|thumb|left|[[Museum of the Portuguese Language]].]]\n\nThe Italian influence in S\u00e3o Paulo accents is evident in the Italian neighborhoods such as Bela Vista, Mo\u00f3ca, Br\u00e1s and Lapa. Italian mingled with Portuguese and as an old influence, was assimilated or disappeared into spoken language. The local accent with Italian influences became notorious through the songs of [[Adoniran Barbosa]], a Brazilian [[samba]] singer born to Italian parents who used to sing using the local accent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://revistalingua.uol.com.br/textos.asp?codigo%3D12097 |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706154937/http://revistalingua.uol.com.br/textos.asp?codigo=12097 |archivedate=July 6, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOther languages spoken in the city are mainly among the Asian community: S\u00e3o Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan.

In a period of a century, between the middle of 1870 and 1970 the city of S\u00e3o Paulo was \"practically demolished and rebuilt at least three times\". These three periods are characterized by the typical constructive processes of their times.\n\n===Urban planning===\n[[File:S\u00e3o Paulo - Planet Imagery.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Changes in urban fabrics in the region of [[Jardins]]: side by side, vertical areas and low houses]]\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo has a history of actions, projects and plans related to urban planning that can be traced to the governments of Antonio da Silva Prado, Baron Duprat, Washington and Luis Francisco Prestes Maia. However, in general, the city was formed during the 20th century, growing from village to metropolis through a series of informal processes and irregular urban sprawl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://friendsite.com/hardwarezone/blog/16972/S%C3%A3o+Paulo+is+the+largest+city+in+Brazil.html|title=S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest city in Brazil|publisher=|accessdate=May 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106065345/http://friendsite.com/hardwarezone/blog/16972/S%C3%A3o+Paulo+is+the+largest+city+in+Brazil.html|archive-date=January 6, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nUrban growth in S\u00e3o Paulo has followed three patterns since the beginning of the 20th century, according to urban historians: since the late 19th Century and until the 1940s, S\u00e3o Paulo was a condensed city in which different social groups lived in a small urban zone separated by type of housing; from the 1940s to the 1980s, S\u00e3o Paulo followed a model of center-periphery social segregation, in which the upper and middle-classes occupied central and modern areas while the poor moved towards precarious, self-built housing in the periphery; and from the 1980s onward, new transformations have brought the social classes closer together in spatial terms, but separated by walls and security technologies that seek to isolate the richer classes in the name of security.<ref name=\"Caldeira, Teresa P.R. 2000. p. 215\">[Caldeira, Teresa P.R. \"City of Walls: Crime, Segregation, and Citizenship in S\u00e3o Paulo,\" University of California Press, 2000. Berkeley. (p. 215)]</ref>\n\nThus, S\u00e3o Paulo differs considerably from other Brazilian cities such as [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[Goi\u00e2nia]], whose initial expansion followed determinations by a plan, or a city like [[Bras\u00edlia]], whose master plan had been fully developed prior to construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pt.scribd.com/doc/134833915/Sao-Paulo|title=S\u00e3o Paulo|publisher=|accessdate=May 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106065345/http://pt.scribd.com/doc/134833915/Sao-Paulo|archive-date=January 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n[[File:SP from Altino Arantes Building.jpg|thumb|The city view from [[Altino Arantes Building]]]]\n[[File:S\u00e3o Paulo view.jpg|thumb|Vale do Anhangaba\u00fa, in [[Central Zone of S\u00e3o Paulo|Downtown]]]]\n\nThe effectiveness of these plans has been seen by some planners and historians as questionable. Some of these scholars argue that such plans were produced exclusively for the benefit of the wealthier strata of the population while the working classes would be relegated to the traditional informal processes. In S\u00e3o Paulo until the mid-1950s, the plans were based on the idea of \"demolish and rebuild\", including former Mayor Prestes Maia S\u00e3o Paulo's road plan (known as the Avenues Plan) or Saturnino de Brito's plan for the Tiet\u00ea River.\n\nThe Plan of the Avenues was implemented during the 1920s and sought to build large avenues connecting the city center with the outskirts. This plan included renewing the commercial city center, leading to real estate speculation and gentrification of several downtown neighborhoods . The plan also led to the expansion of bus services, which would soon replace the trolley as the preliminary transportation system.<ref>[Moreira dos Santos, Laerte. \"Expansao Urbana da Cidade de S\u00e3o Paulo e a Segregacao Socio-Espacial Durante o Periodo de 1850\u20131992\" Instituto Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo, 1992]</ref> This contributed to the outwards expansion of S\u00e3o Paulo and the peripherization of poorer residents. Peripheral neighborhoods were usually unregulated and consisted mainly of self-built single-family houses.<ref name=\"Caldeira, Teresa P.R. 2000. p. 215\"/>\n\nIn 1968 the Urban Development Plan proposed the Basic Plan for Integrated Development of S\u00e3o Paulo, under the administration of Figueiredo Ferraz. The main result was zoning laws. It lasted until 2004 when the Basic Plan was replaced by the current Master Plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wewantsexualfreedom.com/?p=32987|title=S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.|publisher=|accessdate=May 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018200142/http://www.wewantsexualfreedom.com/?p=32987|archive-date=October 18, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThat zoning, adopted in 1972, designated \"Z1\" areas ([[residential area]]s designed for elites) and \"Z3\" (a \"mixed zone\" lacking clear definitions about their characteristics).

The poorest and the newcomers were now unable to purchase their lot and build their house, and were forced to look for a housing alternative. As a result, [[favela]]s and precarious tenements (corti\u00e7os) appeared.<ref>[Caldeira, Teresa P.R. ''City of Walls: Crime, Segregation, and Citizenship in S\u00e3o Paulo'', University of California Press, 2000. Berkeley.]</ref> These housing types were often located closer to the center of the city: favelas could sprawl in any terrain that had not previously been utilized (often dangerous or unsanitary) and decaying or abandoned buildings for tenements were abundant inside the city. Favelas went back into the urban perimeter, occupying the small lots that had not yet been occupied by urbanization \u2013 alongside polluted rivers, railways, or between bridges.<ref>Da Gama Torres, Heraldo, et. al. \"Pobreza e espaco: padroes de segregacao em S\u00e3o Paulo,\" Estud. av.[online]. 2003</ref>\n\nBy 1993, 19.8% of S\u00e3o Paulo's population lived in [[favelas]], compared to 5.2% in 1980.<ref>[Fix, Mariana, et al. \"Urban Slums Report: The Case of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\" in Understanding Slums: Case Studies for the Global Report on Human Settlements 2003.

His songs drew from the life of urban workers, the unemployed and those who lived on the edge. His first big hit was \"Saudosa Maloca\" (\"Shanty of Fond Memories\" \u2013 1951), wherein three homeless friends recall with nostalgia their improvised shanty home, which was torn down by the landowner to make room for a building. His 1964 [[Trem das Onze]] (\"The 11&nbsp;pm Train\"), became one of the five best samba songs ever, the protagonist explains to his lover that he cannot stay any longer because he has to catch the last train to the [[Ja\u00e7an\u00e3 (district of S\u00e3o Paulo)|Ja\u00e7an\u00e3 suburb]], for his mother will not sleep before he arrives home.

The literary priests included [[Manuel da N\u00f3brega]] and [[Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta]], living in or near the colony then called ''Piratininga''. They also helped to register the [[Old Tupi language]], lexicon and its grammar.\nIn 1922, the Brazilian Modernist Movement, launched in S\u00e3o Paulo, began to achieve cultural independence. Brazil had gone through the same stages of development as the rest of Latin America, but its political and cultural [[independence]] came more gradually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2k4004k4&chunk.id=d0e5397&toc.id=d0e5397&brand=ucpress|title=Mexico at the World's Fairs|publisher=|accessdate=May 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317220302/http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2k4004k4&chunk.id=d0e5397&toc.id=d0e5397&brand=ucpress|archive-date=March 17, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBrazilian elite culture was originally strongly tied to [[Culture of Portugal|Portugal]].

Other tribes also lived in areas that today form the metropolitan region.\n\nThe region was divided in Caciquedoms (chiefdoms) at the time of encounter with the Europeans. The most notable Cacique was Tibiri\u00e7a, known for his support for the Portuguese and other European colonists. Among the many indigenous names that survive today are Tiet\u00ea, Ipiranga, Tamanduate\u00ed, Anhangaba\u00fa, Piratininga, Itaquaquecetuba, Cotia, Itapevi, Barueri, Embu-Gua\u00e7u etc...<!-- Places, people or both? -->\n\n===Colonial period===\n[[File:Ant\u00f4nio Parreiras - Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de S\u00e3o Paulo, 1913.jpg|thumb|''Founding of S\u00e3o Paulo'', 1913 painting by Antonio Parreiras]]\n[[File:P\u00e1tio do Col\u00e9gio in S\u00e3o Paulo.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of the College, ''P\u00e1tio do Col\u00e9gio'', in the Historic Center of S\u00e3o Paulo.

The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] college of twelve priests included Manuel da N\u00f3brega and Spanish priest [[Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta]]. They built a mission on top of a steep hill between the [[Anhangaba\u00fa River|Anhangaba\u00fa]] and [[Tamanduate\u00ed River|Tamanduate\u00ed]] rivers.<ref name=\"Lawrence183\">[[#Lawrence69|Rachel Lawrence]]: 2010, p. 183</ref>\n\nThey first had a small structure built of rammed earth, made by American Indian workers in their traditional style. The priests wanted to evangelize \u2013 teach ([[catechesis]]) the Indians who lived in the Plateau region of Piratininga and convert them to Christianity. The site was separated from the coast by the [[Serra do Mar]], called by the Indians ''Serra Paranapiacaba.''\n\nThe college was named for a Christian saint and its founding on the feast day of the celebration of the conversion of the Apostle [[Paul of Tarsus]]. Father Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta wrote this account in a letter to the Society of Jesus:\n\n{{quote|The settlement of the region's Courtyard of the College began in 1560. During the visit of Mem de S\u00e1, Governor-General of Brazil, the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente, he ordered the transfer of the population of the Village of Santo Andr\u00e9 da Borda do Campo to the vicinity of the college. It was then named \"College of St. Paul Piratininga\". The new location was on a steep hill adjacent to a large wetland, the lowland do Carmo. It offered better protection from attacks by local Indian groups. It was renamed Vila de S\u00e3o Paulo, belonging to the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente.}}\n\nFor the next two centuries, S\u00e3o Paulo developed as a poor and isolated village that survived largely through the cultivation of [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence crops]] by the labor of natives. For a long time, S\u00e3o Paulo was the only village in Brazil's interior, as travel was too difficult for many to reach the area. Mem de S\u00e1 forbade colonists to use the \"Path Piraiqu\u00ea\" (Pia\u00e7aguera today), because of frequent Indian raids along it.\n\nOn March 22, 1681, the Marquis de Cascais, the donee of the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente, moved the capital to the village of St. Paul, designating it the \"Head of the captaincy\". The new capital was established on April 23, 1683, with public celebrations.\n\n====The Bandeirantes====\n{{Main|Bandeirantes}}\n[[File:Sao Paulo - Monumento \u00e0s Bandeiras - foto Carlos Alkmin nr 07-13 4282b.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Monument to the Bandeiras]] commemorates the 17th-century ''[[bandeiras]]'']]\n\nIn the 17th century, S\u00e3o Paulo was one of the poorest regions of the Portuguese colony. It was also the center of interior colonial development. Because they were extremely poor, the Paulistas could not afford to buy [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]], as did other Portuguese colonists. The discovery of gold in the region of [[Minas Gerais]], in the 1690s, brought attention and new settlers to S\u00e3o Paulo. The Captaincy of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas do Ouro was created on November 3, 1709, when the Portuguese crown purchased the Captaincies of S\u00e3o Paulo and Santo Amaro from the former grantees.\n\nConveniently located in the country, up the steep ''[[Serra do Mar]]'' sea ridge when traveling from [[Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo|Santos]], while also not too far from the coastline, S\u00e3o Paulo became a safe place to stay for tired travellers. The town became a centre for the ''[[bandeirantes]]'', intrepid explorers who marched into unknown lands in search for gold, diamonds, precious stones, and Indians to enslave.\n[[File:Domingos Jorge Velho.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Domingos Jorge Velho]], a notable ''bandeirante''.]]\n\nThe ''bandeirantes'', which could be translated as \"flag-bearers\" or \"flag-followers\", organized excursions into the land with the primary purpose of profit and the expansion of territory for the Portuguese crown. Trade grew from the local markets and from providing food and accommodation for explorers. The ''bandeirantes'' eventually became politically powerful as a group, and forced the expulsion of the [[Jesuit]]s from the city of S\u00e3o Paulo in 1640. The two groups had frequently come into conflict because of the Jesuits' opposition to the domestic [[slave trade]] in Indians.\n\nOn July 11, 1711, the town of S\u00e3o Paulo was elevated to city status. Around the 1720s, gold was found by the pioneers in the regions near what are now Cuiab\u00e1 and Goiania. The Portuguese expanded their Brazilian territory beyond the [[Tordesillas Line]] to incorporate the gold regions.\n\nWhen the gold ran out in the late 18th century, S\u00e3o Paulo shifted to growing [[sugar cane]]. Cultivation of this commodity crop spread through the interior of the Captaincy. The sugar was exported through the [[Port of Santos]]. At that time, the first modern highway between S\u00e3o Paulo and the coast was constructed and named the Walk of Lorraine.\n\nNowadays, the estate that is home to the Governor of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, located in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, is called the ''Pal\u00e1cio dos Bandeirantes'' (Palace of Bandeirantes), in the neighbourhood of Morumbi.\n\n===Imperial Period===\n{{Main|Empire of Brazil}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| total_width = 400\n| image1 = Monumento \u00e0 Independ\u00eancia 02.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Monument to the Independence of Brazil|Monument to Independence]] in Independence Park, located at the place where then-[[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]] proclaimed the [[independence of Brazil]]\n| image2 = Marc Ferrez - IMS 002001MF005003.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = [[Pra\u00e7a da S\u00e9|Cathedral Square of S\u00e3o Paulo]] in 1880, during the reign of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]] by [[Marc Ferrez (photographer)|Marc Ferrez]].\n| footer = \n}}\n\nAfter Brazil became independent from Portugal in 1822, as declared by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro I]] where the Monument of Ipiranga is located, he named S\u00e3o Paulo as an Imperial City. In 1827, a law school was founded at the Convent of S\u00e3o Francisco, today part of the [[University of S\u00e3o Paulo]]. The influx of students and teachers gave a new impetus to the city's growth, thanks to which the city became the ''Imperial City and Borough of Students of St. Paul of Piratininga''.\n\nThe expansion of [[Coffee production in Brazil|coffee production]] was a major factor in the growth of S\u00e3o Paulo, as it became the region's chief export crop and yielded good revenue. It was cultivated initially in the Vale do Para\u00edba (''Para\u00edba Valley'') region in the East of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, and later on in the regions of Campinas, Rio Claro, S\u00e3o Carlos and Ribeir\u00e3o Preto.\n\nFrom 1869 onwards, S\u00e3o Paulo was connected to the port of Santos by the Railroad Santos-Jundia\u00ed, nicknamed'' The Lady''. In the late 19th century, several other railroads connected the interior to the state capital. S\u00e3o Paulo became the point of convergence of all railroads from the interior of the state. Coffee was the economic engine for major economic and population growth in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nIn 1888, the \"Golden Law\" (''Lei \u00c1urea'') was sanctioned by [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil]], \nabolishing the institution of slavery in Brazil. Slaves were the main source of labour in the coffee plantations until then. As a consequence of this law, and following governmental stimulus towards the increase of immigration, the province began to receive a large number of immigrants, largely Italians, Japanese and Portuguese peasants, many of whom settled in the capital. The region's first industries also began to emerge, providing jobs to the newcomers, especially those who had to learn Portuguese.\n\n===Old Republican Period===\n[[File:Guilherme Gaensly - Esta\u00e7\u00e3o da Luz, c. 1900.jpg|thumb|[[Luz Station]] in 1900]]\n[[File:Avenida Paulista 1902.jpg|thumb|[[Paulista Avenue]] in 1902]]\n\nBy the time Brazil became a republic on November 15, 1889, coffee exports were still an important part of S\u00e3o Paulo's economy. S\u00e3o Paulo grew strong in the national political scene, taking turns with the also rich state of Minas Gerais in electing Brazilian presidents, an alliance that became known as \"[[Caf\u00e9 com leite politics|coffee and milk]]\", given that Minas Gerais was famous for its dairy produce.\n\nDuring this period, S\u00e3o Paulo went from regional center to national metropolis, becoming industrialized and reaching its first million inhabitants in 1928. Its greatest growth in this period was relative in the 1890s when it doubled its population. The height of the coffee period is represented by the construction of the second [[Esta\u00e7\u00e3o da Luz]] (the present building) at the end of the 19th century and by the [[Paulista Avenue]] in 1900, where they built many mansions.<ref name=\"Prefeitura\">{{cite web|url=http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/portal/a_cidade/historia/index.php?p=4827 |title=Abrindo os trilhos para a locomotiva |date=October 5, 2005 |publisher=Prefeitura de S\u00e3o Paulo |accessdate=March 9, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323070214/http://www.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/portal/a_cidade/historia/index.php?p=4827 |archivedate=March 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nIndustrialization was the economic cycle that followed the coffee plantation model. By the hands of some industrious families, including many immigrants of Italian and Jewish origin, factories began to arise and S\u00e3o Paulo became known for its smoky, foggy air. The cultural scene followed [[modernism|modernist]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]] tendencies in fashion at the beginning of the 20th century. Some examples of notable modernist artists are poets [[M\u00e1rio de Andrade]] and [[Oswald de Andrade]], artists [[Anita Malfatti]], [[Tarsila do Amaral]] and [[Lasar Segall]], and sculptor [[Victor Brecheret]]. The [[Modern Art Week]] of 1922 that took place at the [[Theatro Municipal (S\u00e3o Paulo)|Theatro Municipal]] was an event marked by [[avant-garde]] ideas and works of art.

Old factory buildings and warehouses still dot the landscape in neighborhoods such as [[Barra Funda]] and Br\u00e1s. Some cities around S\u00e3o Paulo, such as [[Diadema, S\u00e3o Paulo|Diadema]], [[S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo]], [[Santo Andr\u00e9]], and [[Cubat\u00e3o]] are still heavily industrialized to the present day, with factories producing from cosmetics to chemicals to automobiles.\n{{wide image|Image001_Anhangabau.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|[[:pt:Vale do Anhangaba\u00fa|Anhangaba\u00fa Valley]] in [[Central Zone of S\u00e3o Paulo|Downtown S\u00e3o Paulo]] in 1920}}\n\n===Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932===\n{{main|Constitutionalist Revolution}}\n[[File:S\u00e3o Paulo aviation group in Campo de Marte September 1932.jpg|thumb|left|Group of aviators from S\u00e3o Paulo at [[Campo de Marte Airport]] in September 1932]]\n\nThis \"revolution\" is considered by some historians as the last armed conflict to take place in Brazil's history. On July 9, 1932, the population of S\u00e3o Paulo town rose against a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] by [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] to take the presidential office. The movement grew out of local resentment from the fact that Vargas ruled by decree, unbound by a constitution, in a provisional government. The 1930 coup also affected S\u00e3o Paulo by eroding the autonomy that states enjoyed during the term of the 1891 Constitution and preventing the inauguration of the governor of S\u00e3o Paulo J\u00falio Prestes in the Presidency of the Republic, while simultaneously overthrowing President [[Washington Lu\u00eds]], who was governor of S\u00e3o Paulo from 1920 to 1924. These events marked the end of the Old Republic.\n\nThe uprising commenced on July 9, 1932, after four protesting students were killed by federal government troops on May 23, 1932. On the wake of their deaths, a movement called MMDC (from the initials of the names of each of the four students killed, Martins, Miragaia, Dr\u00e1usio and Camargo) started. A fifth victim, Alvarenga, was also shot that night, but died months later.\n[[File:Passagem_da_Tocha_Ol\u00edmpica_em_SP_(28605512140).jpg|thumb|right|[[Obelisk of S\u00e3o Paulo]], at [[Ibirapuera Park]]]]\n\nIn a few months, the state of S\u00e3o Paulo rebelled against the federal government. Counting on the solidarity of the political elites of two other powerful states, ([[Minas Gerais]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]), the politicians from S\u00e3o Paulo expected a quick war. However, that solidarity was never translated into actual support, and the S\u00e3o Paulo revolt was militarily crushed on October 2, 1932.\n\nIn total, there were 87 days of fighting (July 9 to October 4, 1932 \u2013 with the last two days after the surrender of S\u00e3o Paulo), with a balance of 934 official deaths, though non-official estimates report up to 2,200 dead, and many cities in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo suffered damage due to fighting.\n\nThere is an obelisk in front of [[Ibirapuera Park]] that serves as a memorial to the young men that died for the MMDC. The [[University of S\u00e3o Paulo]]'s Law School also pays homage to the students that died during this period with plaques hung on its arcades.\n\n==Geography==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| total_width = 410\n| image1 = Pico do jaragua aerial 2010.JPG\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = [[Pico do Jaragu\u00e1|Jaragu\u00e1 Peak]] is the highest point in the city, at {{convert|1135|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.picodojaragua.com.br/|title=Pico do Jaragu\u00e1 Mountain Official Website|publisher=Picodojaragua.com.br|accessdate=April 17, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406153234/http://www.picodojaragua.com.br/|archivedate=April 6, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| image2 = Vista de s\u00e3o paulo cantareira.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = [[Cantareira State Park]], part of the [[:pt:Reserva da Biosfera do Cintur\u00e3o Verde de S\u00e3o Paulo|Green Belt Biosphere Reserve]]\n| footer = \n}}\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo is located in [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeastern Brazil]], in southeastern [[S\u00e3o Paulo State]], approximately halfway between [[Curitiba]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]].

According to data from the Map of Violence 2011, published by the Sangari Institute and the Ministry of Justice, the city of S\u00e3o Paulo has the lowest homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants among all Brazilian capitals.\n\n===Social challenges===\n[[File:Parais\u00f3polis_I.jpg|thumb|[[Favela]] of [[Parais\u00f3polis (S\u00e3o Paulo)|Parais\u00f3polis]], in the district of [[Vila Andrade]], with residential buildings in the background.]]\n[[File:Conjunto habitacional em Heli\u00f3polis.jpg|thumb|[[Public housing]] in [[Heli\u00f3polis]].]]\n{{Main|Social issues in Brazil}}\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, S\u00e3o Paulo has been a major economic center in Latin America. During two [[World war|World Wars]] and the [[Great Depression]], coffee exports (from other regions of the state) were critically affected. This led wealthy coffee farmers to invest in industrial activities that turned S\u00e3o Paulo into Brazil's largest industrial hub.\n* [[Crime statistics|Crime rates]] consistently decreased in the 21st century. The citywide homicide rate was 9.0 in 2011, less than half the 22.3 national rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssp.sp.gov.br/noticia/lenoticia.aspx?id=26648|title=Capital reduz homic\u00eddios para 9 a cada 100 mil habitantes|publisher=SSP/SP|date=January 27, 2012|accessdate=January 27, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806210116/http://www.ssp.sp.gov.br/noticia/lenoticia.aspx?id=26648|archivedate=August 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* Air quality<ref>{{cite journal|author=School of Public Health, University of S\u00e3o Paulo|title=Air pollution and children's health in S\u00e3o Paulo (1986\u20131998)|journal=Soc Sci Med|year=2003|volume=57|issue=Dec|pages=2013\u20132022|pmid=14512233|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(03)00068-6}}</ref> has steadily increased during the modern era.\n* The two major rivers crossing the city, [[Tiet\u00ea River|Tiet\u00ea]] and Pinheiros, are highly polluted.

The general language from S\u00e3o Paulo General, or [[Tupi language|Tupi Austral]] (Southern Tupi), was the Tupi-based trade language of what is now S\u00e3o Vicente, S\u00e3o Paulo, and the upper Tiet\u00ea River. In the 17th century it was widely spoken in S\u00e3o Paulo and spread to neighboring regions while in Brazil. From 1750 on, following orders from [[Marquess of Pombal]], Portuguese language was introduced through immigration and consequently taught to children in schools. The original [[Tupi Austral]] language subsequently lost ground to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and eventually became extinct. Due to the large influx of [[Japanese Brazilians|Japanese]], [[German Brazilians|German]], [[Brazilians of Spanish descent|Spanish]], [[Italian Brazilian|Italian]] and [[Arab Brazilian|Arab]] immigrants etc., the Portuguese idiom spoken in the metropolitan area of S\u00e3o Paulo reflects influences from those languages. Due to globalization, English is now spoken by some residents as a foreign language.\n[[File:Interior do Museu da L\u00edngua Portuguesa em S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil.jpg|thumb|left|[[Museum of the Portuguese Language]].]]\n\nThe Italian influence in S\u00e3o Paulo accents is evident in the Italian neighborhoods such as Bela Vista, Mo\u00f3ca, Br\u00e1s and Lapa. Italian mingled with Portuguese and as an old influence, was assimilated or disappeared into spoken language. The local accent with Italian influences became notorious through the songs of [[Adoniran Barbosa]], a Brazilian [[samba]] singer born to Italian parents who used to sing using the local accent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://revistalingua.uol.com.br/textos.asp?codigo%3D12097 |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706154937/http://revistalingua.uol.com.br/textos.asp?codigo=12097 |archivedate=July 6, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOther languages spoken in the city are mainly among the Asian community: S\u00e3o Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan.

In a period of a century, between the middle of 1870 and 1970 the city of S\u00e3o Paulo was \"practically demolished and rebuilt at least three times\". These three periods are characterized by the typical constructive processes of their times.\n\n===Urban planning===\n[[File:S\u00e3o Paulo - Planet Imagery.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Changes in urban fabrics in the region of [[Jardins]]: side by side, vertical areas and low houses]]\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo has a history of actions, projects and plans related to urban planning that can be traced to the governments of Antonio da Silva Prado, Baron Duprat, Washington and Luis Francisco Prestes Maia. However, in general, the city was formed during the 20th century, growing from village to metropolis through a series of informal processes and irregular urban sprawl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://friendsite.com/hardwarezone/blog/16972/S%C3%A3o+Paulo+is+the+largest+city+in+Brazil.html|title=S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest city in Brazil|publisher=|accessdate=May 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106065345/http://friendsite.com/hardwarezone/blog/16972/S%C3%A3o+Paulo+is+the+largest+city+in+Brazil.html|archive-date=January 6, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nUrban growth in S\u00e3o Paulo has followed three patterns since the beginning of the 20th century, according to urban historians: since the late 19th Century and until the 1940s, S\u00e3o Paulo was a condensed city in which different social groups lived in a small urban zone separated by type of housing; from the 1940s to the 1980s, S\u00e3o Paulo followed a model of center-periphery social segregation, in which the upper and middle-classes occupied central and modern areas while the poor moved towards precarious, self-built housing in the periphery; and from the 1980s onward, new transformations have brought the social classes closer together in spatial terms, but separated by walls and security technologies that seek to isolate the richer classes in the name of security.<ref name=\"Caldeira, Teresa P.R. 2000. p. 215\">[Caldeira, Teresa P.R. \"City of Walls: Crime, Segregation, and Citizenship in S\u00e3o Paulo,\" University of California Press, 2000. Berkeley. (p. 215)]</ref>\n\nThus, S\u00e3o Paulo differs considerably from other Brazilian cities such as [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[Goi\u00e2nia]], whose initial expansion followed determinations by a plan, or a city like [[Bras\u00edlia]], whose master plan had been fully developed prior to construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pt.scribd.com/doc/134833915/Sao-Paulo|title=S\u00e3o Paulo|publisher=|accessdate=May 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106065345/http://pt.scribd.com/doc/134833915/Sao-Paulo|archive-date=January 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n[[File:SP from Altino Arantes Building.jpg|thumb|The city view from [[Altino Arantes Building]]]]\n[[File:S\u00e3o Paulo view.jpg|thumb|Vale do Anhangaba\u00fa, in [[Central Zone of S\u00e3o Paulo|Downtown]]]]\n\nThe effectiveness of these plans has been seen by some planners and historians as questionable. Some of these scholars argue that such plans were produced exclusively for the benefit of the wealthier strata of the population while the working classes would be relegated to the traditional informal processes. In S\u00e3o Paulo until the mid-1950s, the plans were based on the idea of \"demolish and rebuild\", including former Mayor Prestes Maia S\u00e3o Paulo's road plan (known as the Avenues Plan) or Saturnino de Brito's plan for the Tiet\u00ea River.\n\nThe Plan of the Avenues was implemented during the 1920s and sought to build large avenues connecting the city center with the outskirts. This plan included renewing the commercial city center, leading to real estate speculation and gentrification of several downtown neighborhoods . The plan also led to the expansion of bus services, which would soon replace the trolley as the preliminary transportation system.<ref>[Moreira dos Santos, Laerte. \"Expansao Urbana da Cidade de S\u00e3o Paulo e a Segregacao Socio-Espacial Durante o Periodo de 1850\u20131992\" Instituto Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo, 1992]</ref> This contributed to the outwards expansion of S\u00e3o Paulo and the peripherization of poorer residents. Peripheral neighborhoods were usually unregulated and consisted mainly of self-built single-family houses.<ref name=\"Caldeira, Teresa P.R. 2000. p. 215\"/>\n\nIn 1968 the Urban Development Plan proposed the Basic Plan for Integrated Development of S\u00e3o Paulo, under the administration of Figueiredo Ferraz. The main result was zoning laws. It lasted until 2004 when the Basic Plan was replaced by the current Master Plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wewantsexualfreedom.com/?p=32987|title=S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.|publisher=|accessdate=May 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018200142/http://www.wewantsexualfreedom.com/?p=32987|archive-date=October 18, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThat zoning, adopted in 1972, designated \"Z1\" areas ([[residential area]]s designed for elites) and \"Z3\" (a \"mixed zone\" lacking clear definitions about their characteristics).

The poorest and the newcomers were now unable to purchase their lot and build their house, and were forced to look for a housing alternative. As a result, [[favela]]s and precarious tenements (corti\u00e7os) appeared.<ref>[Caldeira, Teresa P.R. ''City of Walls: Crime, Segregation, and Citizenship in S\u00e3o Paulo'', University of California Press, 2000. Berkeley.]</ref> These housing types were often located closer to the center of the city: favelas could sprawl in any terrain that had not previously been utilized (often dangerous or unsanitary) and decaying or abandoned buildings for tenements were abundant inside the city. Favelas went back into the urban perimeter, occupying the small lots that had not yet been occupied by urbanization \u2013 alongside polluted rivers, railways, or between bridges.<ref>Da Gama Torres, Heraldo, et. al. \"Pobreza e espaco: padroes de segregacao em S\u00e3o Paulo,\" Estud. av.[online]. 2003</ref>\n\nBy 1993, 19.8% of S\u00e3o Paulo's population lived in [[favelas]], compared to 5.2% in 1980.<ref>[Fix, Mariana, et al. \"Urban Slums Report: The Case of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\" in Understanding Slums: Case Studies for the Global Report on Human Settlements 2003.

His songs drew from the life of urban workers, the unemployed and those who lived on the edge. His first big hit was \"Saudosa Maloca\" (\"Shanty of Fond Memories\" \u2013 1951), wherein three homeless friends recall with nostalgia their improvised shanty home, which was torn down by the landowner to make room for a building. His 1964 [[Trem das Onze]] (\"The 11&nbsp;pm Train\"), became one of the five best samba songs ever, the protagonist explains to his lover that he cannot stay any longer because he has to catch the last train to the [[Ja\u00e7an\u00e3 (district of S\u00e3o Paulo)|Ja\u00e7an\u00e3 suburb]], for his mother will not sleep before he arrives home.

The literary priests included [[Manuel da N\u00f3brega]] and [[Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta]], living in or near the colony then called ''Piratininga''. They also helped to register the [[Old Tupi language]], lexicon and its grammar.\nIn 1922, the Brazilian Modernist Movement, launched in S\u00e3o Paulo, began to achieve cultural independence. Brazil had gone through the same stages of development as the rest of Latin America, but its political and cultural [[independence]] came more gradually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2k4004k4&chunk.id=d0e5397&toc.id=d0e5397&brand=ucpress|title=Mexico at the World's Fairs|publisher=|accessdate=May 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317220302/http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft2k4004k4&chunk.id=d0e5397&toc.id=d0e5397&brand=ucpress|archive-date=March 17, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBrazilian elite culture was originally strongly tied to [[Culture of Portugal|Portugal]].
