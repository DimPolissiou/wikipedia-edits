{"title_page": "Significance arithmetic", "text_new": "'''Significance arithmetic''' is a set of rules (sometimes called '''significant figure rules''') for approximating the [[propagation of uncertainty]] in scientific or statistical calculations. These rules can be used to find the appropriate number of [[significant figures]] to use to represent the result of a calculation.  If a calculation is done without analysis of the uncertainty involved, a result that is written with too many significant figures can be taken to imply a higher [[Arithmetic precision|precision]] than is known, and a result that is written with too few significant figures results in an avoidable loss of precision.  Understanding these rules requires a good understanding of the concept of [[significant figures|significant and insignificant figures]].\n\nThe rules of significance arithmetic are an approximation based on statistical rules for dealing with probability distributions.  See the article on [[propagation of uncertainty]] for these more advanced and precise rules.  Significance arithmetic rules rely on the assumption that the number of significant figures in the [[operand]]s gives accurate information about the uncertainty of the operands and hence the uncertainty of the result. For an alternatives see [[interval arithmetic]] and [[floating point error mitigation]].\n\nAn important caveat is that significant figures apply only to ''measured'' values. Values known to be exact should be ignored for determining the number of significant figures that belong in the result. Examples of such values include:\n* [[integer]] counts (e.g., the number of oranges in a bag)\n* definitions of one unit in terms of another (e.g. a minute is 60 seconds)\n* actual prices asked or offered, and quantities given in requirement specifications\n* legally defined conversions, such as international currency exchange\n* scalar operations, such as \"tripling\" or \"halving\"\n* mathematical constants, such as [[\u03c0]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|e]]\n\nPhysical constants such as the [[gravitational constant]], however, have a limited number of significant digits, because these constants are known to us only by measurement. On the other hand, c ([[speed of light]]) is exactly 299,792,458&nbsp;m/s by definition.\n\n==Multiplication and division using significance arithmetic==\nWhen multiplying or dividing numbers, the result is [[rounding|rounded]] to the ''number'' of significant figures in the factor with the least significant figures. Here, the ''quantity'' of significant figures in each of the factors is important\u2014not the ''position'' of the significant figures.  For instance, using significance arithmetic rules:\n\n*8 \u00d7 8 \u2248 6 &times; 10<sup>1</sup>\n*8 \u00d7 8.0 \u2248 6 &times; 10<sup>1</sup>\n*8.0 \u00d7 8.0 \u2248 64\n*8.02 \u00d7 8.02 \u2248 64.3\n*8 / 2.0 \u2248 4\n*8.6 /2.0012 \u2248 4.3\n*2 \u00d7 0.8 \u2248 2\n\nIf, in the above, the numbers are assumed to be measurements (and therefore probably inexact) then \"8\" above represents an inexact measurement with only one significant digit.  Therefore, the result of \"8 \u00d7 8\" is rounded to a result with only one significant digit, i.e., \"6 &times; 10<sup>1</sup>\" instead of the unrounded \"64\" that one might expect.  In many cases, the rounded result is less accurate than the non-rounded result; a measurement of \"8\" has an actual underlying quantity between 7.5 and 8.5. The true square would be in the range between 56.25 and 72.25. So 6 &times; 10<sup>1</sup> is the best one can give, as other possible answers give a false sense of accuracy.  Further, the 6 &times; 10<sup>1</sup> is itself confusing (as it might be considered to imply 60 \u00b15, which is over-optimistic; more accurate would be 64 \u00b18).\n\n==Addition and subtraction using significance arithmetic==\nWhen adding or subtracting using significant figures rules, results are rounded to the ''position'' of the least significant digit in the most uncertain of the numbers being summed (or subtracted). That is, the result is rounded to the last digit that is significant in ''each'' of the numbers being summed. Here the ''position'' of the significant figures is important, but the ''quantity'' of significant figures is irrelevant.  Some examples using these rules:\n\n:{|cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2px\n| || || ||1\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid black;\"|+ ||style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid black;\"| ||style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid black;\"| ||style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid black;\"|1.1\n|-\n| || || ||2\n|}\n* 1 is significant to the ones place, 1.1 is significant to the tenths place.

These include the [[logarithm]] function, the [[exponential function]] and the [[trigonometric functions]]. The significance of the result depends on the [[condition number]]. In general, the number of significant figures for the result is equal to the number of significant figures for the input minus the [[order of magnitude]] of the condition number.\n\nThe condition number of a differentiable function ''f'' at a point ''x'' is <math>\\left|\\frac{xf'(x)}{f(x)}\\right|;</math>  see [[Condition number#One variable|Condition number: One variable]] for details. Note that if a function has a zero at a point, its condition number at the point is infinite, as infinitesimal changes in the input can change the output from zero to non-zero, yielding a ratio with zero in the denominator, hence an infinite relative change.

It is especially useful when dealing with large data sets.\n\nThis rule helps to eliminate the upwards skewing of data when using traditional rounding rules.  Whereas traditional rounding always rounds up when the following digit is 5, bankers sometimes round down to eliminate this upwards bias.\n\n''See the article on [[rounding]] for more information on rounding rules and a detailed explanation of the round-to-even rule.''\n\n==Disagreements about importance==\nSignificant figures are used extensively in high school and undergraduate courses as a shorthand for the precision with which a measurement is known. However, significant figures are ''not'' a perfect representation of uncertainty, and are not meant to be. Instead, they are a useful tool for avoiding expressing more information than the experimenter actually knows, and for avoiding rounding numbers in such a way as to lose precision.\n\nFor example, here are some important differences between significant figure rules and uncertainty:\n* Uncertainty is not the same as a mistake.  If the outcome of a particular experiment is reported as 1.234\u00b10.056 it does not mean the observer made a mistake;  it may be that the outcome is inherently statistical, and is best described by the expression indicating a value showing only those digits that are significant, ie the known digits plus one uncertain digit, in this case  1.23\u00b10.06.  To describe that outcome as 1.234 would be incorrect under these circumstances, even though it expresses ''less'' uncertainty.\n* Uncertainty is not the same as insignificance, and vice versa. An uncertain number may be highly significant (example: [http://www.av8n.com/physics/uncertainty.htm#sec-extracting signal averaging]). Conversely, a completely certain number may be insignificant.\n* Significance is not the same as significant ''digits''. Digit-counting is not as rigorous a way to represent significance as specifying the uncertainty separately and explicitly (such as 1.234\u00b10.056).\n* Manual, algebraic [[propagation of uncertainty]]\u2014the nominal topic of this article\u2014is possible, but challenging. Alternative methods include the [http://www.av8n.com/physics/uncertainty.htm#sec-crank3 crank three times] method and the [[Monte Carlo method]].

These rules can be used to find the appropriate number of [[significant figures]] to use to represent the result of a calculation.  If a calculation is done without analysis of the uncertainty involved, a result that is written with too many significant figures can be taken to imply a higher [[Arithmetic precision|precision]] than is known, and a result that is written with too few significant figures results in an avoidable loss of precision.  Understanding these rules requires a good understanding of the concept of [[significant figures|significant and insignificant figures]].\n\nThe rules of significance arithmetic are an approximation based on statistical rules for dealing with probability distributions.  See the article on [[propagation of uncertainty]] for these more advanced and precise rules.  Significance arithmetic rules rely on the assumption that the number of significant figures in the [[operand]]s gives accurate information about the uncertainty of the operands and hence the uncertainty of the result. For an alternatives see [[interval arithmetic]] and [[floating point error mitigation]].\n\nAn important caveat is that significant figures apply only to ''measured'' values. Values known to be exact should be ignored for determining the number of significant figures that belong in the result. Examples of such values include:\n* [[integer]] counts (e.g., the number of oranges in a bag)\n* definitions of one unit in terms of another (e.g. a minute is 60 seconds)\n* actual prices asked or offered, and quantities given in requirement specifications\n* legally defined conversions, such as international currency exchange\n* scalar operations, such as \"tripling\" or \"halving\"\n* mathematical constants, such as [[\u03c0]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|e]]\n\nPhysical constants such as the [[gravitational constant]], however, have a limited number of significant digits, because these constants are known to us only by measurement. On the other hand, c ([[speed of light]]) is exactly 299,792,458&nbsp;m/s by definition.\n\n==Multiplication and division using significance arithmetic==\nWhen multiplying or dividing numbers, the result is [[rounding|rounded]] to the ''number'' of significant figures in the factor with the least significant figures. Here, the ''quantity'' of significant figures in each of the factors is important\u2014not the ''position'' of the significant figures.  For instance, using significance arithmetic rules:\n\n*8 \u00d7 8 \u2248 6 &times; 10<sup>1</sup>\n*8 \u00d7 8.0 \u2248 6 &times; 10<sup>1</sup>\n*8.0 \u00d7 8.0 \u2248 64\n*8.02 \u00d7 8.02 \u2248 64.3\n*8 / 2.0 \u2248 4\n*8.6 /2.0012 \u2248 4.3\n*2 \u00d7 0.8 \u2248 2\n\nIf, in the above, the numbers are assumed to be measurements (and therefore probably inexact) then \"8\" above represents an inexact measurement with only one significant digit.  Therefore, the result of \"8 \u00d7 8\" is rounded to a result with only one significant digit, i.e., \"6 &times; 10<sup>1</sup>\" instead of the unrounded \"64\" that one might expect.  In many cases, the rounded result is less accurate than the non-rounded result; a measurement of \"8\" has an actual underlying quantity between 7.5 and 8.5. The true square would be in the range between 56.25 and 72.25. So 6 &times; 10<sup>1</sup> is the best one can give, as other possible answers give a false sense of accuracy.  Further, the 6 &times; 10<sup>1</sup> is itself confusing (as it might be considered to imply 60 \u00b15, which is over-optimistic; more accurate would be 64 \u00b18).\n\n==Addition and subtraction using significance arithmetic==\nWhen adding or subtracting using significant figures rules, results are rounded to the ''position'' of the least significant digit in the most uncertain of the numbers being summed (or subtracted). That is, the result is rounded to the last digit that is significant in ''each'' of the numbers being summed. Here the ''position'' of the significant figures is important, but the ''quantity'' of significant figures is irrelevant.

During the [[International Women's Year]] in 1975 Icelandic women attracted great attention when they organized a general strike to show how important women's undervalued work was. 90 per cent of the Icelandic women went on strike. And at the [[1980 Icelandic presidential election|presidential election in 1980]] the women's movement focused on electing a woman. After much persuasion Vigd\u00eds accepted to run against three male candidates. She was the first woman in the world to be elected as head of state in a democratic election, despite being a divorced single mother. She was narrowly elected, with 33.6 percent of the national vote, while her nearest rival got 32.1 percent. She became very popular and was subsequently reelected three times, unopposed in 1984, with 94.6 percent of the votes against another woman in [[1988 Icelandic presidential election|1988]] and unopposed in 1992. In [[1996 Icelandic presidential election|1996]] she decided not to run for reelection.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nAlthough the Icelandic presidency is largely a ceremonial position,<ref name=icemag/> Vigd\u00eds took an active role as environmental activist and fought for Icelandic language and culture, acting as a cultural ambassador in promoting the country.

Every year hundreds\u2014sometimes thousands\u2014walked the 50-km road to Keflav\u00edk and chanted \"\u00cdsland \u00far [[NATO]], herinn burt\" (literally: Iceland out of NATO, the military away).\n\n==Artistic and academic career==\nAfter graduation, Vigd\u00eds taught French and French drama at the University and worked with experimental theatre. She worked with the Reykjav\u00edk Theatre Company from 1954 to 1957 and again from 1961 to 1964. During the summers, she also worked as a tour guide.

During the [[International Women's Year]] in 1975 Icelandic women attracted great attention when they organized a general strike to show how important women's undervalued work was. 90 per cent of the Icelandic women went on strike. And at the [[1980 Icelandic presidential election|presidential election in 1980]] the women's movement focused on electing a woman. After much persuasion Vigd\u00eds accepted to run against three male candidates. She was the first woman in the world to be elected as head of state in a democratic election, despite being a divorced single mother. She was narrowly elected, with 33.6 percent of the national vote, while her nearest rival got 32.1 percent. She became very popular and was subsequently reelected three times, unopposed in 1984, with 94.6 percent of the votes against another woman in [[1988 Icelandic presidential election|1988]] and unopposed in 1992. In [[1996 Icelandic presidential election|1996]] she decided not to run for reelection.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nAlthough the Icelandic presidency is largely a ceremonial position,<ref name=icemag/> Vigd\u00eds took an active role as environmental activist and fought for Icelandic language and culture, acting as a cultural ambassador in promoting the country.
