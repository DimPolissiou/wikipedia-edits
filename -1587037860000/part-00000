Set in a decaying and morally bankrupt [[New York City]] following the [[Vietnam War]], the film tells the story of [[Travis Bickle]] (De Niro), a lonely taxi driver who descends into insanity as he plots to assassinate both the presidential candidate (Harris) for whom the woman he is infatuated with (Shepherd) works, and the pimp (Keitel) of an [[Child prostitution|underage prostitute]] (Foster) he befriends.\n\nA critical and commercial success upon release and nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], including for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for De Niro) and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (for Foster), ''Taxi Driver'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1976 Cannes Film Festival]]. The film generated controversy at the time of its release for its depiction of violence and casting of a 12-year-old Foster in the role of a child prostitute.\n\nIn 2012, ''[[Sight & Sound]]'' named it the 31st-best film ever in its decennial [[BFI The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time|critics' poll]], ranked with ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', and the fifth-greatest film of all time on its directors' poll. The film was considered \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant by the US [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] in 1994.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, [[Travis Bickle]] is a lonely, [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] 26-year-old living in isolation in [[New York City]]. Travis takes a job as a night shift taxi driver to cope with his [[chronic insomnia]], driving passengers around the city's [[New York City borough|boroughs]]. He frequents [[movie theater|porn theaters]] and keeps a diary in which he consciously attempts to include [[aphorisms]], such as \"You're only as healthy as you feel.\"\n\nTravis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her, then takes her out for coffee.\n\nTravis is disgusted by the sleaze, dysfunction, and prostitution that he witnesses throughout the city, and [[Existential crisis|struggles to find meaning for his existence]]. His worldview is furthered when a young prostitute and runaway, Iris, who uses the professional name \"Easy,\" enters his taxi, attempting to escape her [[pimp]], Sport. Sport drags Iris from the taxi and throws Travis a crumpled $20 bill, which continually reminds Travis of her and the corruption that surrounds him.\n\nTravis takes Betsy on a date to see a pornographic film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His numerous attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers and apologizing over the phone are rebuffed, causing him to become embittered and convinced that she is exactly like the \"cold\" people he detests in the city. He finally confronts her at the campaign office, berating her before being kicked out by Tom.\n\nOne evening, an unhinged passenger gloats to Travis of his intention to kill his wife and her secret lover. Later, Travis joins fellow taxi drivers in a diner. Outside, he confides in Wizard about his \"bad\" thoughts, which are beginning to turn violent; Wizard assures him that he will be fine (\"Don't worry so much,\" he says), leaving Travis to his own destructive path.\n\nIn attempting to find an outlet for his frustrations, Travis begins a program of intense physical training. A fellow taxi driver refers him to an illegal gun dealer, \"Easy\" Andy, from whom Travis buys four handguns. At home, Travis practices [[Fast draw|drawing]] his weapons, and builds a rig to allow him to hide and quickly deploy one of his guns from his [[Sleeve gun|sleeve]]. He also begins attending Palantine's rallies to study their security. One night, Travis enters a convenience store seconds before a robber enters and holds the owner at gunpoint, leading Travis to fatally shoot the robber. To help him evade arrest, the store owner, an acquaintance of Travis, takes responsibility for the deed, claiming one of Travis's guns as his own.\n\nTravis seeks out Iris through Sport, and twice tries to convince her to stop prostituting herself, an effort which partially convinces her. After a breakfast with Iris, Travis mails her a letter containing money, imploring her to return home. Travis cuts his hair into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] and attends a public rally, where he intends to assassinate Palantine. While attempting to pull out his gun, [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents notice Travis putting his hand inside his coat and chase him down. Travis, however, successfully escapes the scene.\n\nThat evening, Travis drives to Sport's brothel in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. After Sport flicks a cigarette at Travis and derides him outside of the building, he shoots Sport and enters the brothel. Travis shoots the owner's fingers off before being shot in the neck by Sport, whom he fatally shoots in turn. Travis moves upstairs, pursued by the owner, where Iris's client shoots him in the shoulder; Travis kills the made man with the sleeve pistol, stabs the gangster in the hand and fatally shoots him with the made man's [[revolver]] as Iris cries out in terror. He attempts suicide with the revolver, only to find it empty; the police arrive and find a collapsed, bleeding Travis, who looks at them while pantomiming shooting himself before passing out from blood loss.\n\nTravis is not prosecuted, but instead, he is hailed as a local hero in the press, as the criminal dealings of those in the brothel were discovered and publicized. He receives a letter from Iris's father, thanking him for saving her and revealing that she has returned home to [[Pittsburgh]], where she is going to school. After weeks of recovery and returning to work, Travis  encounters Betsy as a fare. Travis drives her home, then refuses to let her pay the fare, driving away with a smile. As Travis drives off, he becomes suddenly agitated after noticing something in his rear-view mirror.\n\n== Cast ==\n<ref name=\"AFI\">{{cite web |url=http://catalog.afi.com/Film/67969-TAXI-DRIVER?sid=b658a8a0-9843-4955-9bd4-560b9f1553aa&sr=4.241532&cp=1&pos=0 |title=Taxi Driver |publisher=[[American Film Institute|AFI]] |accessdate=December 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229172009/http://catalog.afi.com/Film/67969-TAXI-DRIVER?sid=b658a8a0-9843-4955-9bd4-560b9f1553aa&sr=4.241532&cp=1&pos=0|archive-date=December 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"BFI\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7bc1b8 |title=Taxi Driver (1976) |publisher=[[British Film Institute|BFI]] |accessdate=December 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229171911/https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7bc1b8|archive-date=December 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Travis Bickle]]\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Iris\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Tom\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Sport\n* [[Leonard Harris (actor)|Leonard Harris]] as Charles Palantine\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as Wizard\n* [[Cybill Shepherd]] as Betsy\n* [[Diahnne Abbott]] as Concession Girl\n* Frank Adu as Angry Black Man\n* [[Victor Argo|Vic Argo]] as Melio\n* Gino Ardito as Policeman At Rally\n* Garth Avery as Iris' Friend\n* Harry Cohn as Cabbie In Bellmore\n* Copper Cunningham as Hooker In Cab\n* [[Brenda Dickson]] as Soap Opera Woman\n* Harry Fischler as Dispatcher\n* Nat Grant as Stick-up Man\n* Richard Higgs as Tall Secret Service Man\n* Beau Kayser as Soap Opera Man\n* Victor Magnotta as Secret Service Photographer\n* Robert Maroff as Mafioso\n* Norman Matlock as Charlie T.\n* [[Senator Bobby|Bill Minkin]] as Tom's assistant\n* Murray Moston as Iris' Time Keeper\n* [[Harry Northup]] as Doughboy\n* Gene Palma as Street Drummer\n* Carey Poe as Campaign Worker\n* [[American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince|Steven Prince]] as Andy, Gun Salesman\n* Peter Savage as The John\n* [[Martin Scorsese]] as Passenger Watching Silhouette\n* Robert Shields as Palantine Aide\n* Ralph Singleton as T.V.

In ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', Scorsese says ''Taxi Driver'' arose from his feeling that movies are like dreams or drug-induced reveries. He attempted to incubate within the viewer the feeling of being in a limbo state between sleeping and waking. He calls Travis an \"avenging angel\" floating through the streets of a New York City intended to represent all cities everywhere. Scorsese calls attention to improvisation in the film, such as in the scene between De Niro and Cybill Shepherd in the coffee shop. The director also cites [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Wrong Man]]'' and Jack Hazan's ''[[A Bigger Splash (1974 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'' as inspirations for his camerawork in the movie.<ref name=\"Ian Christie 1989\">\"Scorsese on Scorsese\" edited by David Thompson and Ian Christie. 057114103X: series London; Boston: Faber and Faber, 1989. Call#: Van Pelt Library PN1998.3.S39 A3 1989</ref>\n\nIn writing the script, Schrader was inspired by the diaries of [[Arthur Bremer]] (who shot presidential candidate [[George Wallace]] in 1972), by Jean-Paul Sartre's existential novel ''Nausea'' and John Ford's film ''The Searchers''.<ref name=\"Rausch\" /> The writer also used himself as inspiration; in a 1981 interview with Tom Snyder on the \"Tomorrow\" show, Schrader related his experience living in New York City while battling chronic insomnia, which led him to frequent pornographic bookstores and theaters because they remained open all night. Following a divorce and a breakup with a live-in girlfriend, he spent a few weeks living in his car. After visiting a hospital for a [[stomach ulcer]], Schrader wrote the screenplay for ''Taxi Driver'' in \"under a fortnight,\" recalling that \"When I was talking to the nurse, I realised I hadn't spoken to anyone in weeks ... that was when the metaphor of the taxi occurred to me. That is what I was: this person in an iron box, a coffin, floating round the city, but seemingly alone.\" Schrader decided to make Bickle a Vietnam vet because the [[national trauma]] of the war seemed to blend perfectly with Bickle's paranoid psychosis, making his experiences after the war more intense and threatening.<ref>\"Travis gave punks a hair of aggression.\" ''Toronto Star'' February 12, 2005: H02</ref>\n\n=== Symbolism ===\nIn ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', Scorsese mentions the religious [[Iconography|symbolism]] in the story, comparing Bickle to a saint who wants to cleanse or purge both his mind and his body of weakness. Bickle attempts to kill himself near the end of the movie as a tribute to the [[samurai]]'s \"[[Seppuku|death with honor]]\" principle.<ref name=\"Ian Christie 1989\" />\n\nWhen Travis meets Betsy to join him for coffee and pie, she is reminded of a line in [[Kris Kristofferson]]'s song [[The Silver Tongued Devil and I|\"The Pilgrim, Chapter 33\"]]: \"He's a prophet and a pusher, partly truth, partly fiction\u2014a walking contradiction.\" On their date, Bickle takes her to see a Swedish \"sex education\" film, which is in fact the American sexploitation film ''Sexual Freedom in Denmark'' with added Swedish sound.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bj\u00f6rklund |first=Elisabet |year=2011 |title='This is a dirty movie' \u2013 Taxi Driver and 'Swedish sin' |journal=Journal of Scandinavian Cinema |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=169\u2013170 |doi=10.1386/jsca.1.2.163_1}}</ref>\n\n''Taxi Driver'' was shot during a New York City summer [[heat wave]] and [[sanitation]] [[Work stoppage|strike]] in 1975.  The film came into conflict with the [[MPAA]] for its violence. Scorsese de-saturated the color in the final shootout, and the film got an R rating. To achieve the atmospheric scenes in Bickle's taxi, the sound men would get in the trunk and Scorsese and his cinematographer, [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], would ensconce themselves on the back seat floor and use available light to shoot. Chapman admitted the filming style was greatly influenced by [[French New Wave|New Wave]] filmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and his cinematographer [[Raoul Coutard]] due to the fact the crew did not have the time nor the money to do \"traditional things.\" <ref>Kilday, Gregg (April 7, 2016). \"''Taxi Driver'' Oral History: De Niro, Scorsese, Foster, Schrader Spill All on 40th Anniversary\".

This detail was suggested by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Scorsese, who had a small role as a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent and who had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted: \"He told us that, in Saigon, if you saw a guy with his head shaved\u2014like a little Mohawk\u2014that usually meant that those people were ready to go into a certain Special Forces situation. You didn't even go near them.

According to Boyle, he would \"finish shooting on a Friday in Rome ... get on a plane ... [and] fly to New York.\" De Niro obtained a taxi driver's license, and when on break would pick up a taxi and drive around New York for a couple of weeks, before returning to Rome to resume filming ''1900.'' De Niro apparently lost 35 pounds and listened repeatedly to a taped reading of the diaries of [[Arthur Bremer]]. When he had time off from shooting ''1900'', De Niro visited an army base in [[Northern Italy]] and tape-recorded soldiers from the [[Midwestern United States]], whose accents he thought might be appropriate for Travis's character.<ref>Rausch, Andrew J. (2010). ''The Films of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro''. Scarecrow Press. p. 31. {{ISBN|9780810874145}}.</ref>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nScorsese brought in the [[film title design]]er [[Dan Perri]] to design the [[title sequence]] for ''Taxi Driver''. Perri had been Scorsese's original choice to design the titles for ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' in 1974, but [[Warner Bros]] would not allow him to hire an unknown designer. By the time ''Taxi Driver'' was going into production, Perri had established his reputation with his work on ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', and Scorsese was now able to hire him. Perri created the opening titles for ''Taxi Driver'' using [[Second unit filming|second unit]] footage which he color-treated through a process of film copying and [[slit-scan]], resulting in a highly stylised graphic sequence that evoked the \"underbelly\" of New York City through lurid colors, glowing [[neon sign]]s distorted nocturnal images and deep [[black level]]s. Perri went on to design opening titles for a number of major films after this including ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980).<ref>Perkins, Will. \"Dan Perri: A Career Retrospective\".

According to producer [[Michael Phillips (producer)|Michael Phillips]], \"the whole West Side was bombed out. There really were row after row of condemned buildings and that's what we used to build our sets, were condemned buildings. Now it's fashionable real estate&nbsp;...

Robert Barnett of MusicWeb International has said that it contrasts deep, sleazy noises, representing the \"scum\" that Travis sees all over the city, with the saxophone, a musical counterpart to Travis, creating a mellifluously disenchanted troubadour, played by [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]]. Barnett also observes that the opposing noises in the soundtrack\u2014gritty little harp figures, hard as shards of steel, as well as a jazz drum kit placing the drama in the city\u2014are indicative of loneliness in the midst of mobs of people. Deep brass and woodwinds are also evident. Barnett heard in the drumbeat a wild-eyed martial air charting the pressure on Bickle, who is increasingly oppressed by the corruption around him, and that the harp, drum, and saxophone play significant roles in the music.<ref>Taxi Driver: Music composed by Bernard Hermann. musicweb-international.com.

Travis takes a job as a night shift taxi driver to cope with his [[chronic insomnia]], driving passengers around the city's [[New York City borough|boroughs]]. He frequents [[movie theater|porn theaters]] and keeps a diary in which he consciously attempts to include [[aphorisms]], such as \"You're only as healthy as you feel.\"\n\nTravis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her, then takes her out for coffee.\n\nTravis is disgusted by the sleaze, dysfunction, and prostitution that he witnesses throughout the city, and [[Existential crisis|struggles to find meaning for his existence]]. His worldview is furthered when a young prostitute and runaway, Iris, who uses the professional name \"Easy,\" enters his taxi, attempting to escape her [[pimp]], Sport. Sport drags Iris from the taxi and throws Travis a crumpled $20 bill, which continually reminds Travis of her and the corruption that surrounds him.\n\nTravis takes Betsy on a date to see a pornographic film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His numerous attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers and apologizing over the phone are rebuffed, causing him to become embittered and convinced that she is exactly like the \"cold\" people he detests in the city. He finally confronts her at the campaign office, berating her before being kicked out by Tom.\n\nOne evening, an unhinged passenger gloats to Travis of his intention to kill his wife and her secret lover. Later, Travis joins fellow taxi drivers in a diner. Outside, he confides in Wizard about his \"bad\" thoughts, which are beginning to turn violent; Wizard assures him that he will be fine (\"Don't worry so much,\" he says), leaving Travis to his own destructive path.\n\nIn attempting to find an outlet for his frustrations, Travis begins a program of intense physical training. A fellow taxi driver refers him to an illegal gun dealer, \"Easy\" Andy, from whom Travis buys four handguns. At home, Travis practices [[Fast draw|drawing]] his weapons, and builds a rig to allow him to hide and quickly deploy one of his guns from his [[Sleeve gun|sleeve]]. He also begins attending Palantine's rallies to study their security. One night, Travis enters a convenience store seconds before a robber enters and holds the owner at gunpoint, leading Travis to fatally shoot the robber. To help him evade arrest, the store owner, an acquaintance of Travis, takes responsibility for the deed, claiming one of Travis's guns as his own.\n\nTravis seeks out Iris through Sport, and twice tries to convince her to stop prostituting herself, an effort which partially convinces her. After a breakfast with Iris, Travis mails her a letter containing money, imploring her to return home. Travis cuts his hair into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] and attends a public rally, where he intends to assassinate Palantine. While attempting to pull out his gun, [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents notice Travis putting his hand inside his coat and chase him down. Travis, however, successfully escapes the scene.\n\nThat evening, Travis drives to Sport's brothel in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. After Sport flicks a cigarette at Travis and derides him outside of the building, he shoots Sport and enters the brothel. Travis shoots the owner's fingers off before being shot in the neck by Sport, whom he fatally shoots in turn. Travis moves upstairs, pursued by the owner, where Iris's client shoots him in the shoulder; Travis kills the made man with the sleeve pistol, stabs the gangster in the hand and fatally shoots him with the made man's [[revolver]] as Iris cries out in terror. He attempts suicide with the revolver, only to find it empty; the police arrive and find a collapsed, bleeding Travis, who looks at them while pantomiming shooting himself before passing out from blood loss.\n\nTravis is not prosecuted, but instead, he is hailed as a local hero in the press, as the criminal dealings of those in the brothel were discovered and publicized. He receives a letter from Iris's father, thanking him for saving her and revealing that she has returned home to [[Pittsburgh]], where she is going to school. After weeks of recovery and returning to work, Travis  encounters Betsy as a fare. Travis drives her home, then refuses to let her pay the fare, driving away with a smile. As Travis drives off, he becomes suddenly agitated after noticing something in his rear-view mirror.\n\n== Cast ==\n<ref name=\"AFI\">{{cite web |url=http://catalog.afi.com/Film/67969-TAXI-DRIVER?sid=b658a8a0-9843-4955-9bd4-560b9f1553aa&sr=4.241532&cp=1&pos=0 |title=Taxi Driver |publisher=[[American Film Institute|AFI]] |accessdate=December 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229172009/http://catalog.afi.com/Film/67969-TAXI-DRIVER?sid=b658a8a0-9843-4955-9bd4-560b9f1553aa&sr=4.241532&cp=1&pos=0|archive-date=December 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"BFI\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7bc1b8 |title=Taxi Driver (1976) |publisher=[[British Film Institute|BFI]] |accessdate=December 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229171911/https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6b7bc1b8|archive-date=December 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Travis Bickle]]\n* [[Jodie Foster]] as Iris\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Tom\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as Sport\n* [[Leonard Harris (actor)|Leonard Harris]] as Charles Palantine\n* [[Peter Boyle]] as Wizard\n* [[Cybill Shepherd]] as Betsy\n* [[Diahnne Abbott]] as Concession Girl\n* Frank Adu as Angry Black Man\n* [[Victor Argo|Vic Argo]] as Melio\n* Gino Ardito as Policeman At Rally\n* Garth Avery as Iris' Friend\n* Harry Cohn as Cabbie In Bellmore\n* Copper Cunningham as Hooker In Cab\n* [[Brenda Dickson]] as Soap Opera Woman\n* Harry Fischler as Dispatcher\n* Nat Grant as Stick-up Man\n* Richard Higgs as Tall Secret Service Man\n* Beau Kayser as Soap Opera Man\n* Victor Magnotta as Secret Service Photographer\n* Robert Maroff as Mafioso\n* Norman Matlock as Charlie T.\n* [[Senator Bobby|Bill Minkin]] as Tom's assistant\n* Murray Moston as Iris' Time Keeper\n* [[Harry Northup]] as Doughboy\n* Gene Palma as Street Drummer\n* Carey Poe as Campaign Worker\n* [[American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince|Steven Prince]] as Andy, Gun Salesman\n* Peter Savage as The John\n* [[Martin Scorsese]] as Passenger Watching Silhouette\n* Robert Shields as Palantine Aide\n* Ralph Singleton as T.V.

In ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', Scorsese says ''Taxi Driver'' arose from his feeling that movies are like dreams or drug-induced reveries. He attempted to incubate within the viewer the feeling of being in a limbo state between sleeping and waking. He calls Travis an \"avenging angel\" floating through the streets of a New York City intended to represent all cities everywhere. Scorsese calls attention to improvisation in the film, such as in the scene between De Niro and Cybill Shepherd in the coffee shop. The director also cites [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Wrong Man]]'' and Jack Hazan's ''[[A Bigger Splash (1974 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'' as inspirations for his camerawork in the movie.<ref name=\"Ian Christie 1989\">\"Scorsese on Scorsese\" edited by David Thompson and Ian Christie. 057114103X: series London; Boston: Faber and Faber, 1989. Call#: Van Pelt Library PN1998.3.S39 A3 1989</ref>\n\nIn writing the script, Schrader was inspired by the diaries of [[Arthur Bremer]] (who shot presidential candidate [[George Wallace]] in 1972), by Jean-Paul Sartre's existential novel ''Nausea'' and John Ford's film ''The Searchers''.<ref name=\"Rausch\" /> The writer also used himself as inspiration; in a 1981 interview with Tom Snyder on the \"Tomorrow\" show, Schrader related his experience living in New York City while battling chronic insomnia, which led him to frequent pornographic bookstores and theaters because they remained open all night. Following a divorce and a breakup with a live-in girlfriend, he spent a few weeks living in his car. After visiting a hospital for a [[stomach ulcer]], Schrader wrote the screenplay for ''Taxi Driver'' in \"under a fortnight,\" recalling that \"When I was talking to the nurse, I realised I hadn't spoken to anyone in weeks ... that was when the metaphor of the taxi occurred to me. That is what I was: this person in an iron box, a coffin, floating round the city, but seemingly alone.\" Schrader decided to make Bickle a Vietnam vet because the [[national trauma]] of the war seemed to blend perfectly with Bickle's paranoid psychosis, making his experiences after the war more intense and threatening.<ref>\"Travis gave punks a hair of aggression.\" ''Toronto Star'' February 12, 2005: H02</ref>\n\n=== Symbolism ===\nIn ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', Scorsese mentions the religious [[Iconography|symbolism]] in the story, comparing Bickle to a saint who wants to cleanse or purge both his mind and his body of weakness. Bickle attempts to kill himself near the end of the movie as a tribute to the [[samurai]]'s \"[[Seppuku|death with honor]]\" principle.<ref name=\"Ian Christie 1989\" />\n\nWhen Travis meets Betsy to join him for coffee and pie, she is reminded of a line in [[Kris Kristofferson]]'s song [[The Silver Tongued Devil and I|\"The Pilgrim, Chapter 33\"]]: \"He's a prophet and a pusher, partly truth, partly fiction\u2014a walking contradiction.\" On their date, Bickle takes her to see a Swedish \"sex education\" film, which is in fact the American sexploitation film ''Sexual Freedom in Denmark'' with added Swedish sound.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bj\u00f6rklund |first=Elisabet |year=2011 |title='This is a dirty movie' \u2013 Taxi Driver and 'Swedish sin' |journal=Journal of Scandinavian Cinema |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=169\u2013170 |doi=10.1386/jsca.1.2.163_1}}</ref>\n\n''Taxi Driver'' was shot during a New York City summer [[heat wave]] and [[sanitation]] [[Work stoppage|strike]] in 1975.  The film came into conflict with the [[MPAA]] for its violence. Scorsese de-saturated the color in the final shootout, and the film got an R rating. To achieve the atmospheric scenes in Bickle's taxi, the sound men would get in the trunk and Scorsese and his cinematographer, [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], would ensconce themselves on the back seat floor and use available light to shoot. Chapman admitted the filming style was greatly influenced by [[French New Wave|New Wave]] filmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and his cinematographer [[Raoul Coutard]] due to the fact the crew did not have the time nor the money to do \"traditional things.\" <ref>Kilday, Gregg (April 7, 2016). \"''Taxi Driver'' Oral History: De Niro, Scorsese, Foster, Schrader Spill All on 40th Anniversary\".

This detail was suggested by actor Victor Magnotta, a friend of Scorsese, who had a small role as a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent and who had served in Vietnam. Scorsese later noted: \"He told us that, in Saigon, if you saw a guy with his head shaved\u2014like a little Mohawk\u2014that usually meant that those people were ready to go into a certain Special Forces situation. You didn't even go near them.

According to Boyle, he would \"finish shooting on a Friday in Rome ... get on a plane ... [and] fly to New York.\" De Niro obtained a taxi driver's license, and when on break would pick up a taxi and drive around New York for a couple of weeks, before returning to Rome to resume filming ''1900.'' De Niro apparently lost 35 pounds and listened repeatedly to a taped reading of the diaries of [[Arthur Bremer]]. When he had time off from shooting ''1900'', De Niro visited an army base in [[Northern Italy]] and tape-recorded soldiers from the [[Midwestern United States]], whose accents he thought might be appropriate for Travis's character.<ref>Rausch, Andrew J. (2010). ''The Films of Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro''. Scarecrow Press. p. 31. {{ISBN|9780810874145}}.</ref>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nScorsese brought in the [[film title design]]er [[Dan Perri]] to design the [[title sequence]] for ''Taxi Driver''. Perri had been Scorsese's original choice to design the titles for ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' in 1974, but [[Warner Bros]] would not allow him to hire an unknown designer. By the time ''Taxi Driver'' was going into production, Perri had established his reputation with his work on ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', and Scorsese was now able to hire him. Perri created the opening titles for ''Taxi Driver'' using [[Second unit filming|second unit]] footage which he color-treated through a process of film copying and [[slit-scan]], resulting in a highly stylised graphic sequence that evoked the \"underbelly\" of New York City through lurid colors, glowing [[neon sign]]s distorted nocturnal images and deep [[black level]]s. Perri went on to design opening titles for a number of major films after this including ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977) and ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980).<ref>Perkins, Will. \"Dan Perri: A Career Retrospective\".

According to producer [[Michael Phillips (producer)|Michael Phillips]], \"the whole West Side was bombed out. There really were row after row of condemned buildings and that's what we used to build our sets, were condemned buildings. Now it's fashionable real estate&nbsp;... But New York and Times Square was shuddering and disgusting. It's just exciting to see the city bounce back and become the great place it is today from where it was then.

Robert Barnett of MusicWeb International has said that it contrasts deep, sleazy noises, representing the \"scum\" that Travis sees all over the city, with the saxophone, a musical counterpart to Travis, creating a mellifluously disenchanted troubadour, played by [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]]. Barnett also observes that the opposing noises in the soundtrack\u2014gritty little harp figures, hard as shards of steel, as well as a jazz drum kit placing the drama in the city\u2014are indicative of loneliness in the midst of mobs of people. Deep brass and woodwinds are also evident. Barnett heard in the drumbeat a wild-eyed martial air charting the pressure on Bickle, who is increasingly oppressed by the corruption around him, and that the harp, drum, and saxophone play significant roles in the music.<ref>Taxi Driver: Music composed by Bernard Hermann. musicweb-international.com.

Steeped in irony, the five-minute epilogue underscores the vagaries of fate. The media builds Bickle into a hero, when, had he been a little quicker drawing his gun against Senator Palantine, he would have been reviled as an assassin.
