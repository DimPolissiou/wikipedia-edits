In 2019, the [[WrestleMania 35|35th]] edition took place at [[MetLife Stadium]] and attracted 82,265 spectators.]]\n\nThis is a '''list of WWE pay-per-view and WWE Network events''', detailing all [[professional wrestling]] cards promoted on [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) and the [[WWE Network]] by [[WWE]].\n\nWWE has been broadcasting PPV events since the 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events ([[Royal Rumble]], [[WrestleMania]], [[SummerSlam]], and [[Survivor Series]]) were first established. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in the mid-1990s before expanding even further in the early-2000s. Aside from its standard monthly schedule, WWE produced additional international PPVs between 1997 and 2003. These events were not available in the United States and coincided with overseas tours in the United Kingdom. Following WWE's original [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] in 2002, the company promoted two touring rosters representing its [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] television programs. The traditional \"Big Four\" continued to showcase the entire roster, while the remaining PPV events alternated between Raw and SmackDown cards. A special [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] PPV in 2005 led to the creation of an [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]] in 2006, which also received its own dedicated PPV events. In March 2007, WWE announced that all subsequent PPV events would feature performers from all brands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |accessdate=December 1, 2007 |title=WWE Pay-Per-Views to follow WrestleMania formula |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319234707/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |df= }}</ref> In 2008, all WWE PPV events began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].\n\nThe company's PPV business began to drastically change with the launch of the WWE Network on February 24, 2014. While most of the WWE events still air in many parts of the world on traditional PPV channels, WWE's focus has shifted away from delivering their events on PPV channels. Their main focus now is delivering all of the events on the WWE Network, including some that are exclusively on the Network. WWE has pushed the Network's launching price of [[United States dollar|US$]]9.99 monthly<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/wwenetwork|title=WWE Network Subscription - Free Trial|website=www.wwe.com}}</ref> as a way to lure potential customers away from traditional PPV which, on average, costs five to six times as much (in the United States) as the Network. The WWE Network also features the back catalog of WWE, [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], and ECW PPV events, as well as all WWE Network exclusive events from [[NXT Arrival]] onwards in their on-demand section. All WWE Network events that have aired since the launch of the Network have been broadcast in high-definition.<ref name=LATIMES>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-wwe-network-20140108,0,2623775.story#axzz2ps4J4oVv|title=WWE launching over-the-top network|last=Flint|first=Joe|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 8, 2014|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref> Since the second brand extension in July 2016, brand-exclusive PPVs returned with only the \"Big Four\" as the only PPVs to feature both Raw and SmackDown brands. Just like the previous brand extension, brand exclusive PPVs ended after [[WrestleMania 34]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/wwe-2018-pay-per-view-schedule|title=WWE pay-per-views just got bigger for 2018!|work=WWE|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the WWE Network, WWE PPVs are still made available on traditional PPV outlets in the United States by [[In Demand]]. In Canada, WWE PPVs are available through (depending on service provider) [[Vu!]], [[Shaw PPV]], or [[SaskTel|SaskTel PPV]], and can be seen in movie theatres in HD through selected locations of the [[Cineplex Entertainment]] chain, a practice dating to the [[Famous Players]] ownership by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]. In Australia, WWE's pay-per-views are shown on [[Main Event]]. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, all PPVs are shown on Sky Sports Box Office. In India and South Asia, a single broadcaster (currently [[Sony TEN]]) generally holds the rights to all WWE programming,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151034/http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}</ref> including PPVs, and they are broadcast for no additional charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/howtowatch|title=WWE.com: The Official Site of the WWE Universe|author=|date=|work=WWE}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, WWE PPV events are typically 3\u00bd hours to 4 hours in length, while WWE's WrestleMania events are approximately 5 to 5\u00bd hours in length. WWE airs a pre-show before most Network events known as the ''Kickoff'' show. Each ''Kickoff'' show includes matches, interviews, and a panel of experts previewing the upcoming line-up. The ''Kickoff'' pre-show began as a 30-minute show<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/extremerules/2014/extreme-rules-on-wwe-network-26270262|title=Extreme Rules 2014|publisher=}}</ref> before expanding to 1 hour, beginning with [[Night of Champions (2014)|Night of Champions]] in September 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Night of Champions 2014|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nightofchampions/2014/christian-peep-show-kickoff-26656371|publisher=WWE}}</ref> The \"Big Four\" ''Kickoff'' shows are the longest, at 2 hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=LL Cool J To Open WrestleMania, 2-Hour ''Kickoff'' Show - SEScoops|url=http://www.sescoops.com/ll-cool-jay-to-open-wrestlemania-31-2-hour-kickoff-show/|date=16 March 2015|publisher=}}</ref> WWE occasionally airs a post-show after some Network events.

Each TakeOver pre-show includes interviews and a panel of experts previewing the upcoming line-up. The TakeOver pre-shows are typically 30 minutes in length while some have been 1 hour, beginning with [[NXT TakeOver: San Antonio|TakeOver: San Antonio]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/nxt-takeover-san-antonio-2017-01-28/article/nxt-takeover-san-antonio-wwe-network?client=safari|title=Don\u2019t miss NXT TakeOver: San Antonio tonight|publisher=}}</ref> WWE also occasionally aired a post-show after TakeOver events known as ''TakeOver Fallout''.

In 2019, the [[WrestleMania 35|35th]] edition took place at [[MetLife Stadium]] and attracted 82,265 spectators.]]\n\nThis is a '''list of WWE pay-per-view and WWE Network events''', detailing all [[professional wrestling]] cards promoted on [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) and the [[WWE Network]] by [[WWE]].\n\nWWE has been broadcasting PPV events since the 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events ([[Royal Rumble]], [[WrestleMania]], [[SummerSlam]], and [[Survivor Series]]) were first established. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in the mid-1990s before expanding even further in the early-2000s. Aside from its standard monthly schedule, WWE produced additional international PPVs between 1997 and 2003. These events were not available in the United States and coincided with overseas tours in the United Kingdom. Following WWE's original [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] in 2002, the company promoted two touring rosters representing its [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] television programs. The traditional \"Big Four\" continued to showcase the entire roster, while the remaining PPV events alternated between Raw and SmackDown cards. A special [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] PPV in 2005 led to the creation of an [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]] in 2006, which also received its own dedicated PPV events. In March 2007, WWE announced that all subsequent PPV events would feature performers from all brands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |accessdate=December 1, 2007 |title=WWE Pay-Per-Views to follow WrestleMania formula |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319234707/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |df= }}</ref> In 2008, all WWE PPV events began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].\n\nThe company's PPV business began to drastically change with the launch of the WWE Network on February 24, 2014. While most of the WWE events still air in many parts of the world on traditional PPV channels, WWE's focus has shifted away from delivering their events on PPV channels. Their main focus now is delivering all of the events on the WWE Network, including some that are exclusively on the Network. WWE has pushed the Network's launching price of [[United States dollar|US$]]9.99 monthly<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/wwenetwork|title=WWE Network Subscription - Free Trial|website=www.wwe.com}}</ref> as a way to lure potential customers away from traditional PPV which, on average, costs five to six times as much (in the United States) as the Network. The WWE Network also features the back catalog of WWE, [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], and ECW PPV events, as well as all WWE Network exclusive events from [[NXT Arrival]] onwards in their on-demand section. All WWE Network events that have aired since the launch of the Network have been broadcast in high-definition.<ref name=LATIMES>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-wwe-network-20140108,0,2623775.story#axzz2ps4J4oVv|title=WWE launching over-the-top network|last=Flint|first=Joe|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 8, 2014|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref> Since the second brand extension in July 2016, brand-exclusive PPVs returned with only the \"Big Four\" as the only PPVs to feature both Raw and SmackDown brands. Just like the previous brand extension, brand exclusive PPVs ended after [[WrestleMania 34]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/wwe-2018-pay-per-view-schedule|title=WWE pay-per-views just got bigger for 2018!|work=WWE|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the WWE Network, WWE PPVs are still made available on traditional PPV outlets in the United States by [[In Demand]]. In Canada, WWE PPVs are available through (depending on service provider) [[Vu!]], [[Shaw PPV]], or [[SaskTel|SaskTel PPV]], and can be seen in movie theatres in HD through selected locations of the [[Cineplex Entertainment]] chain, a practice dating to the [[Famous Players]] ownership by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]. In Australia, WWE's pay-per-views are shown on [[Main Event]]. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, all PPVs are shown on Sky Sports Box Office. In India and South Asia, a single broadcaster (currently [[Sony TEN]]) generally holds the rights to all WWE programming,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151034/http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}</ref> including PPVs, and they are broadcast for no additional charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/howtowatch|title=WWE.com: The Official Site of the WWE Universe|author=|date=|work=WWE}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, WWE PPV events are typically 3\u00bd hours to 4 hours in length, while WWE's WrestleMania events are approximately 5 to 5\u00bd hours in length.

Cholesterol is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate enzymatic reactions that initially involves three successive condensations of acetyl-CoA units to form the six-carbon compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). This is reduced to mevalonate and then converted in a series of reactions to the [[isoprene]]s that are building-blocks of [[squalene]], the immediate precursor to sterols, which cyclizes to lanosterol (a methylated sterol) and further metabolized to cholesterol. A number of early attempts to block the synthesis of cholesterol resulted in agents that inhibited late in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and cholesterol. A major rate-limiting step in the pathway is at the level of the microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid, and that has been considered to be a prime target for pharmacologic intervention for several years.<ref name=\"Alberts98\"/>\n\nHMG CoA reductase occurs early in the biosynthetic pathway and is among the first committed steps to cholesterol formulation. Inhibition of this enzyme could lead to accumulation of HMG CoA, a water-soluble intermediate that is, then, capable of being readily metabolized to simpler molecules. This inhibition of reductase would lead to accumulation of lipophylic intermediates with a formal sterol ring.\n\nLovastatin was the first specific inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase to receive approval for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The first breakthrough in efforts to find a potent, specific, competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase occurred in 1976, when [[Akira Endo (biochemist)|Endo]] ''et al.'' reported the discovery of [[mevastatin]], a highly functionalized fungal metabolite, isolated from cultures of ''Penicillium citrium''.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Akira|last=Endo|author2=Kuroda M. |author3=Tsujita Y. |title=ML-236A, ML-236B, and ML-236C, new inhibitors of cholesterogenesis produced by Penicillium citrinium|journal=Journal of Antibiotics|date=December 1976|volume=29|issue=12|pages=1346\u20138|pmid=1010803|doi=10.7164/antibiotics.29.1346}}</ref>\n\n===Biosynthesis===\n\n''In vitro'' formation of a triketide lactone using a genetically modified protein derived from 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase has been demonstrated.

The synthetic sequence is shown in the schemes below. The \u03b3-lactone was synthesized using Yamada methodology starting with glutamic acid. Lactone opening was done using lithium methoxide in [[methanol]] and then [[silylation]] to give a separable mixture of the starting lactone and the [[silyl ether]]. The silyl ether on hydrogenolysis followed by Collins oxidation gave the aldehyde. Stereoselective preparation of (E,E)-diene was accomplished by addition of trans-crotyl phenyl sulfone anion, followed by quenching with [[Acetic anhydride|Ac<sub>2</sub>O]] and subsequent reductive elimination of sulfone acetate. Condensation of this with lithium anion of dimethyl methylphosphonate gave compound 1. Compound 2 was synthesized as shown in the scheme in the synthetic procedure. Compounds 1 and 2 were then combined together using 1.3 eq sodium hydride in THF followed by reflux in [[chlorobenzene]] for 82 hr under nitrogen to get the enone 3.\n\nSimple organic reactions were used to get to lovastatin as shown in the scheme.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Cholesterolbiosynthesis.png|Cholesterol biosynthetic pathway\nImage:Hmg-reductase.png|HMG CoA reductase

Cholesterol is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate enzymatic reactions that initially involves three successive condensations of acetyl-CoA units to form the six-carbon compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). This is reduced to mevalonate and then converted in a series of reactions to the [[isoprene]]s that are building-blocks of [[squalene]], the immediate precursor to sterols, which cyclizes to lanosterol (a methylated sterol) and further metabolized to cholesterol. A number of early attempts to block the synthesis of cholesterol resulted in agents that inhibited late in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and cholesterol. A major rate-limiting step in the pathway is at the level of the microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid, and that has been considered to be a prime target for pharmacologic intervention for several years.<ref name=\"Alberts98\"/>\n\nHMG CoA reductase occurs early in the biosynthetic pathway and is among the first committed steps to cholesterol formulation. Inhibition of this enzyme could lead to accumulation of HMG CoA, a water-soluble intermediate that is, then, capable of being readily metabolized to simpler molecules. This inhibition of reductase would lead to accumulation of lipophylic intermediates with a formal sterol ring.\n\nLovastatin was the first specific inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase to receive approval for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The first breakthrough in efforts to find a potent, specific, competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase occurred in 1976, when [[Akira Endo (biochemist)|Endo]] ''et al.'' reported the discovery of [[mevastatin]], a highly functionalized fungal metabolite, isolated from cultures of ''Penicillium citrium''.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Akira|last=Endo|author2=Kuroda M. |author3=Tsujita Y. |title=ML-236A, ML-236B, and ML-236C, new inhibitors of cholesterogenesis produced by Penicillium citrinium|journal=Journal of Antibiotics|date=December 1976|volume=29|issue=12|pages=1346\u20138|pmid=1010803|doi=10.7164/antibiotics.29.1346}}</ref>\n\n===Biosynthesis===\n\n''In vitro'' formation of a triketide lactone using a genetically modified protein derived from 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase has been demonstrated.

Lactone opening was done using lithium methoxide in [[methanol]] and then [[silylation]] to give a separable mixture of the starting lactone and the [[silyl ether]]. The silyl ether on hydrogenolysis followed by Collins oxidation gave the aldehyde. Stereoselective preparation of (E,E)-diene was accomplished by addition of trans-crotyl phenyl sulfone anion, followed by quenching with [[Acetic anhydride|Ac<sub>2</sub>O]] and subsequent reductive elimination of sulfone acetate. Condensation of this with lithium anion of dimethyl methylphosphonate gave compound 1. Compound 2 was synthesized as shown in the scheme in the synthetic procedure.

They are spherical or ovoid masses of stars, starved of star-making gases. The smallest known elliptical galaxy is about one-tenth the size of the [[Milky Way]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}. The motion of stars in elliptical galaxies is predominantly radial{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}, unlike the disks of [[Spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]], which are dominated by [[rotation]]. Furthermore, there is very little [[interstellar matter]] (neither gas nor dust), which results in low rates of [[star formation]], few [[Open cluster|open star clusters]], and few young stars; rather elliptical galaxies are dominated by [[Population II|old stellar populations]], giving them red colors. Large elliptical galaxies typically have an extensive system of [[globular cluster]]s.\n\nThe dynamical properties of elliptical galaxies and the [[Bulge (astronomy)|bulges]] of [[Disc galaxy|disk galaxies]] are similar, suggesting that they may be formed by the same physical processes, although this remains controversial. The [[Luminosity#In astronomy|luminosity]] profiles of both elliptical galaxies and bulges are well fit by [[Sersic profile|Sersic's law]], and a range of scaling relations between the elliptical galaxies' structural parameters unify the population.<ref>Graham, A.W.

The smallest, the [[Dwarf elliptical galaxy|dwarf elliptical galaxies]], may be no larger than a typical [[globular cluster]], but contain a considerable amount of [[dark matter]] not present in clusters. Most of these small galaxies may not be related to other ellipticals.\n\nThe [[Galaxy morphological classification|Hubble classification]] of elliptical galaxies contains an integer that describes how elongated the galaxy image is.\nThe classification is determined by the ratio of the major (''a'') to the minor (''b'') axes of the galaxy's [[Contour line#Other phenomena|isophotes]]:\n\n:<math>10 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{b}{a}\\right)</math>\n\nThus for a spherical galaxy with ''a'' equal to ''b'', the number\nis 0, and the Hubble type is E0. While the limit in the literature is about E7, it has been known since 1966<ref name=\"adsabs.harvard.edu\" /> that the E4 to E7 galaxies are misclassified lenticular galaxies with disks inclined at different angles to our line of sight.  This has been confirmed through spectral observations revealing the rotation of their stellar disks. \n<ref>Graham, A.W. et al.

Hence, some galaxies with Hubble type E0 are actually elongated.\n\nIt is sometimes said that there are two physical types of ellipticals: the giant ellipticals with slightly \"boxy\"-shaped isophotes, whose shapes result from random motion which is greater in some directions than in others (anisotropic random motion); and the \"disky\" normal and [[dwarf elliptical]]s, which contain disks.\n<ref>Pedraz, S. et al.

Angular Momentum and Constraints on Formation Scenarios]</ref> This is, however, an abuse of the nomenclature, as there are two types of early-type galaxy, those with disks and those without. Given the existence of ES galaxies with intermediate-scale disks, it is reasonable to expect that there is a continuity from E to ES, and onto the S0 galaxies with their large-scale stellar disks that dominate the light at large radii.\n\n[[Dwarf spheroidal galaxy|Dwarf spheroidal galaxies]] appear to be a distinct class: their properties are more similar to those of irregulars and late spiral-type galaxies.\n\nAt the large end of the elliptical spectrum, there is further division, beyond Hubble's classification. Beyond ''gE'' giant ellipticals, lies [[Type-D galaxy|D-galaxies]] and [[Type-cD galaxy|cD-galaxies]]. These are similar to their smaller brethren, but more diffuse, with large haloes that may as much belong to the galaxy cluster within which they reside than the centrally-located giant galaxy.\n\n==Evolution==\n\n{{weasel|section|date= May 2018}}\n\n[[File:A galactic mega-merger.jpg|thumb|[[NGC 3597]] is the product of a collision between two galaxies.

Minor galactic mergers involve two galaxies of very different masses, and are not limited to giant ellipticals. The [[Milky Way]] galaxy, depending upon an unknown tangential component, is on a four- to five-billion-year [[Andromeda\u2013Milky Way collision|collision course]] with the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].<ref>Nagamine, Kentaro; Loeb, Abraham (2003), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003NewA....8..439N Future evolution of nearby large-scale structures in a universe dominated by a cosmological constant]</ref> It has been theorized that an elliptical galaxy will result from a merger of the two spirals.{{Better source|date=September 2018}}\n\nIt is believed that black holes may play an important role in limiting the growth of elliptical galaxies in the early universe by inhibiting [[star formation]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Star formation==\nThe {{Citation needed span|text=traditional portrait|date=March 2015}} of elliptical galaxies paints them as galaxies where [[star formation]] finished after an initial burst at high-redshift, leaving them to shine with only their aging stars.

In spirals, this blue color emanates largely from the young, hot stars in their spiral arms. Very little [[star formation]] is thought to occur in elliptical galaxies, because of their lack of gas compared to spiral or irregular galaxies.

They are spherical or ovoid masses of stars, starved of star-making gases. The smallest known elliptical galaxy is about one-tenth the size of the [[Milky Way]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}. The motion of stars in elliptical galaxies is predominantly radial{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}, unlike the disks of [[Spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]], which are dominated by [[rotation]]. Furthermore, there is very little [[interstellar matter]] (neither gas nor dust), which results in low rates of [[star formation]], few [[Open cluster|open star clusters]], and few young stars; rather elliptical galaxies are dominated by [[Population II|old stellar populations]], giving them red colors. Large elliptical galaxies typically have an extensive system of [[globular cluster]]s.\n\nThe dynamical properties of elliptical galaxies and the [[Bulge (astronomy)|bulges]] of [[Disc galaxy|disk galaxies]] are similar, suggesting that they may be formed by the same physical processes, although this remains controversial. The [[Luminosity#In astronomy|luminosity]] profiles of both elliptical galaxies and bulges are well fit by [[Sersic profile|Sersic's law]], and a range of scaling relations between the elliptical galaxies' structural parameters unify the population.<ref>Graham, A.W.

The smallest, the [[Dwarf elliptical galaxy|dwarf elliptical galaxies]], may be no larger than a typical [[globular cluster]], but contain a considerable amount of [[dark matter]] not present in clusters. Most of these small galaxies may not be related to other ellipticals.\n\nThe [[Galaxy morphological classification|Hubble classification]] of elliptical galaxies contains an integer that describes how elongated the galaxy image is.\nThe classification is determined by the ratio of the major (''a'') to the minor (''b'') axes of the galaxy's [[Contour line#Other phenomena|isophotes]]:\n\n:<math>10 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{b}{a}\\right)</math>\n\nThus for a spherical galaxy with ''a'' equal to ''b'', the number\nis 0, and the Hubble type is E0. While the limit in the literature is about E7, it has been known since 1966<ref name=\"adsabs.harvard.edu\" /> that the E4 to E7 galaxies are misclassified lenticular galaxies with disks inclined at different angles to our line of sight.  This has been confirmed through spectral observations revealing the rotation of their stellar disks. \n<ref>Graham, A.W. et al.

Hence, some galaxies with Hubble type E0 are actually elongated.\n\nIt is sometimes said that there are two physical types of ellipticals: the giant ellipticals with slightly \"boxy\"-shaped isophotes, whose shapes result from random motion which is greater in some directions than in others (anisotropic random motion); and the \"disky\" normal and [[dwarf elliptical]]s, which contain disks.\n<ref>Pedraz, S. et al.

Angular Momentum and Constraints on Formation Scenarios]</ref> This is, however, an abuse of the nomenclature, as there are two types of early-type galaxy, those with disks and those without. Given the existence of ES galaxies with intermediate-scale disks, it is reasonable to expect that there is a continuity from E to ES, and onto the S0 galaxies with their large-scale stellar disks that dominate the light at large radii.\n\n[[Dwarf spheroidal galaxy|Dwarf spheroidal galaxies]] appear to be a distinct class: their properties are more similar to those of irregulars and late spiral-type galaxies.\n\nAt the large end of the elliptical spectrum, there is further division, beyond Hubble's classification. Beyond ''gE'' giant ellipticals, lies [[Type-D galaxy|D-galaxies]] and [[Type-cD galaxy|cD-galaxies]]. These are similar to their smaller brethren, but more diffuse, with large haloes that may as much belong to the galaxy cluster within which they reside than the centrally-located giant galaxy.\n\n==Evolution==\n\n{{weasel|section|date= May 2018}}\n\n[[File:A galactic mega-merger.jpg|thumb|[[NGC 3597]] is the product of a collision between two galaxies.

Minor galactic mergers involve two galaxies of very different masses, and are not limited to giant ellipticals. The [[Milky Way]] galaxy is, depending upon an unknown tangential component, is on a four- to five-billion-year [[Andromeda\u2013Milky Way collision|collision course]] with the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].<ref>Nagamine, Kentaro; Loeb, Abraham (2003), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003NewA....8..439N Future evolution of nearby large-scale structures in a universe dominated by a cosmological constant]</ref> It has been theorized that an elliptical galaxy will result from a merger of the two spirals.{{Better source|date=September 2018}}\n\nIt is believed that black holes may play an important role in limiting the growth of elliptical galaxies in the early universe by inhibiting [[star formation]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Star formation==\nThe {{Citation needed span|text=traditional portrait|date=March 2015}} of elliptical galaxies paints them as galaxies where [[star formation]] finished after an initial burst at high-redshift, leaving them to shine with only their aging stars.

In spirals, this blue color emanates largely from the young, hot stars in their spiral arms. Very little [[star formation]] is thought to occur in elliptical galaxies, because of their lack of gas compared to spiral or irregular galaxies.

Presently divided with India Pakistan and China.Armed sqay makes use of a curved single-edge sword paired with a shield, or one sword in each hand. Unarmed techniques incorporate kicks, punches, locks and chops. Sqay have different techniques single sword double sword free hand techniques and lessons of both free hand and sword.there are two types of Events in Sqay Combat one to one fight with fiber stick Tura with shield this event is of weigh categorizes and other is Artistic with music and with out music ,in olden day of Kashmir history Sqay was a famous art of self defense used by the Kashmiri people the language used in sqay is Kashmari Persian  Pashto and sheena. Grandmaster Mir Nazir Ahmad from pampore Kashmir is the founder of the old kashmiri martial art in new format of sports and introduced it in the world arena as a Traditional Martial art of kashmir and formed the rules for sports comparative events of modern age.            \n\n==History==\nThe early history of sqay is limited to mythology. Folklore traces it to remote antiquity several thousand years ago, as far back as the ancient Kashmiri [[flood myth]]. The snake-worshipping [[Naga people (Lanka)|Naga people]] are said to have created the art prior to the Indo-Aryan invasions, and it was later patronised by kings. The first written evidence of sqay dates to the [[Mughal Empire|Muslim period]] when Persian writings told of sabre-fighting (''shamsherizen'') in Kashmir. The word ''sqay'' itself is first recorded in this period, and is said to mean \"knowledge of war\" in Persian. Sqay first began to decline in the colonial period but its popularity suffered more during the post-independence [[Kashmir conflict]]. In the 1980s, the sqay Grandmaster Mir Nazir Ahmed feared that the art would go extinct, and so introduced modern types of competition influenced by [[karate]] and [[taekwondo]]. The subsequent founding of the International Council Of Sqay and the Sqay Federation Of India have allowed the system to be promoted on a national level. It is now taught in twenty  seven Indian states as well as [[Bhutan]] and [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]]. Bangladesh Sri Lanka Jordan Syria Malaysia, Indonesia.Pakistan, Turkey.Azerbaijan Uzbekistan.Thailand, Iran .Iraq Georgia. \n\n==Training and competition==\nSqay competition typically involves [[sparring]], breaking and [[kata|preset routines]]. Competitors use a stick to simulate a sword, paired with a shield. Specifics of the regulations differ slightly between gender and age groups, such as the size of the arena or the duration of a bout.\n\nUnder the International Council Of Sqay's rules, the sword (''tora'' or ''tura'') is made of synthetic fibre covered in leather. Depending on age group, it measures 2-2.6 feet long. The sword is paired with a shield (''bargula'') measuring 9-10 inches in diameter, also covered in leather. The official uniform is blue, sometimes with red or yellow piping, consisting of trousers and a cross-front jacket with a belt around the waist. Chest and head guards are required only for sparring.\n\n===Sparring===\nSparring (''loba'') takes place in a 5-6.5 metres square. Matches are divided primarily by age but also by weight. A ''dre'' (equal to 3 points) is awarded for well performed mavashi kick (on either side of the headguard). If a maygiri kick is executed effectively on the stomach area, a ''dha'' (2 points) is awarded. A ''yaw'' (1 point) is awarded if the competitor performs a well timed stick (tora or tura) attack. Using excessive force, even to legal scoring areas, results in a penalty or disqualification.\n\nThe arms, legs, head and upper body are all legal targets. Only strikes with the \"blade\" of the stick and the foot below the ankle are allowed. The eyes, groin, hips, knees and uncovered skin are off-limits. The referee can give penalties at any time for ring-outs (''kokoday''), dropping the sword or shield, or hitting an area not recognized as a target. A ''muko'' (warning, deduction of 1 1/2 points) is given for breaking a rule once, followed by a ''dasi muko'' (strong warning, deduction of 3 points) for the second offense and an ''owaza'' (disqualification) for the third.\n\nIf a competitor manages to gain 9 points, they are immediately declared the winner and the match ends. Otherwise, the contestant with more points wins the match. Each bout is 3\u20135 minutes long and may be extended by 5\u20137 minutes in the case of a tie. In the event of a tie at the end of the extended time, a sudden death round is held. In this round, the first competitor to score a point wins the match.\n\n===Breaking===\nThe breaking (''mathol'') of objects is used for both training and demonstration. Any item except glass may be broken, but the most common objects are boards of wood or stone.  Competitors are judged on their technique, form, quantity of items broken, and how cleanly the item(s) is broken. Scores are given on a scale of 10. Breaking in competitions is divided into the individual and team categories. The duration given for each individual or team is 3 minutes. In the team category, the group is judged as a whole using the same point method as the individual category.\n\n===Forms===\nForms or ''khawankay'' are preset patterns of movements designed to improve [[muscle memory]] so the moves can eventually be performed in combat without thinking. Because modern sparring allows only a limited number of basic attacks, the majority of sqay techniques are now only taught through these sequences. In competition, khawankay are demonstrated in a 5-metre square. Competitors are judged on stance, timing and perfection of form. The team category is performed by three practitioners. Khawankay may be done with a single sword or a pair. Techniques are mainly cuts but also include thrusts. In the case of the single-sword, it is alternately held with one or both hands, depending on the move.\n\n==Commands==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n![[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] !!

The song features vocals by [[Justin Vernon]] of [[indie folk]] band [[Bon Iver]], as well as [[Sample (music)|sampling]] his 2009 song \"[[Blood Bank (EP)|Woods]]\". It also contains portions of \"[[Soul Makossa]]\" written by [[Manu Dibango]], and samples of \"Comment No. 1\", performed by [[Gil Scott-Heron]]. It was produced by West and [[Jeff Bhasker]], who wrote the track with Vernon and [[Malik Yusef|Malik Jones]]. \"Lost in the World\" was initially leaked on September 29, 2010 and was 6 minutes and 4 seconds long. The version on the album was split up into two parts, with the outro becoming a new track entitled \"[[Who Will Survive in America]]\".\n\nThe song received acclaim from [[music critics]], who praised the atmospheric production, the appearance of Vernon, and West's verse.

It's experimental, to be sure, but it's also the closest the album comes to pure pop indulgence.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Cole |first=Matthew |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/kanye-west-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/2325 |title=Kanye West My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy| magazine=Slant Magazine |date=2010-10-20 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref> The song peaked on the South Korean Gaon Music Chart at position 104.<ref name=gaon/> In 2017, critics writing for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named the song the fourth best deep cut by a 21st Century Pop Star.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The 100 Best Deep Cuts by 21st Century Pop Stars: Critics' Picks|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8039437/best-pop-album-tracks-21st-century-deep-cuts|magazine=Billboard|date=21 November 2017|accessdate=22 November 2017}}</ref> In 2019, MTV named it among the best overlooked songs of the decade.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Trey Alston |title=The Best Overlooked Songs of the Decade |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3149355/bop-shop-2010s-edition/ |website=MTV |accessdate=23 December 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191220225118/http://www.mtv.com/news/3149355/bop-shop-2010s-edition/ |archivedate=21 December 2019 |date=21 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Marketing==\n\n===Live performances===\n[[File:Kanye Coachella 2011.jpg|thumb|right|230px|West performing at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]] in 2011. ]]\n\nTo promote ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'', West performed the song at [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]].<ref name=\"macy\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/950282/macys-thanksgiving-day-parade-stars-kanye-west-kung-fu-panda|title=Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Stars Kanye West, Kung Fu Panda|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|accessdate=2010-10-25}}</ref> During the performance, West wore black peacoat, fur vest, shiny gold shirt, gold chains, and a headband.<ref name=\"peacoat\"/> According to a reviewer from [[Rap-Up]], he was [[lip sync]]ing the song during the performance.<ref name=\"peacoat\">{{cite web|last=Staff |first=|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/11/25/kanye-west-gets-lost-at-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade/ |title=Kanye West gets 'lost' at Macy's Thanksgiving day parade| publisher= [[Rap Up]].

The song features vocals by [[Justin Vernon]] of [[indie folk]] band [[Bon Iver]], as well as [[Sample (music)|sampling]] his 2009 song \"[[Blood Bank (EP)|Woods]]\". It also contains portions of \"[[Soul Makossa]]\" written by [[Manu Dibango]], and samples of \"Comment No. 1\", performed by [[Gil Scott-Heron]]. It was produced by West and [[Jeff Bhasker]], who wrote the track with Vernon and [[Malik Yusef|Malik Jones]]. \"Lost in the World\" was initially leaked on September 29, 2010 and was 6 minutes and 4 seconds long. The version on the album was split up into two parts, with the outro becoming a new track entitled \"[[Who Will Survive in America]]\".\n\nThe song received acclaim from [[music critics]], who praised the atmospheric production, the appearance of Vernon, and West's verse. The verse by West was described as one of the most poetic of his career, with the song being cited as one of the strongest on ''My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy''. \"Lost in the World\" was featured during the [[closing credits]] of ''[[Runaway (2010 film)|Runaway]]'', a 35-minute [[short film]] directed by West set with music from the album. The song peaked at number 104 on the [[Gaon Chart|South Korean Gaon Chart]]. A music video was directed by Ruth Hogben, featuring black and white cinematography, frantic dancing by [[Model (person)|model]]s and a brief [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] by West. The music video received positive reviews from critics.\n\n\"Lost in the World\" was sampled in a [[Freestyle rap|freestyle]] by West's [[GOOD Music]] labelmate [[Pusha T]], and a remix produced by [[DJ]] [[Ti\u00ebsto]]. West first performed the song live at [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]]. He notably performed the song with Justin Vernon at both [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]] and [[Glastonbury Festival]]. Additionally, \"Lost in the World\" was performed by West at the funeral of Gil Scott-Heron in 2011.\n\n==Background==\nKanye West initially wrote the verses of \"Lost in the World\" as a [[love poem]] emailed to American model [[Kim Kardashian]], who he would later begin dating in 2012 and elope in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=591&v=5TBHmMonV0s|title=Kanye West Calls For Louis Vuitton Boycott, Lays Out His Plans for Fashion World Domination|author=RADIO.COM|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=26 November 2013|accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> West previewed \"Lost in the World\" in July 2010 at the offices of [[Facebook]].<ref name=\"mtv\">{{Cite web|first=James|last=Montgomery|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1644579/kanye-west-shows-off-new-songs-at-facebook-headquarters.jhtml|title=Kanye West Shows Off New Songs At Facebook Headquarters|date=2010-07-28|publisher=[[MTV]].

The [[libretto]], by [[Ilia Tyumenev]], is based on the [[The Tsar's Bride|drama of the same name]] by [[Lev Mey]].  Mey's play was first suggested to the composer as an opera subject in 1868 by [[Mily Balakirev]].  ([[Alexander Borodin]], too, once toyed with the idea.)  However, the opera was not composed until thirty years later, in 1898.  The first performance of the opera took place in 1899 at the Moscow theater of the Private Opera of S.I. Mamontov.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov himself said of the opera that he intended it as a reaction against the ideas of [[Richard Wagner]], and to be in the style of \"cantilena ''par excellence''\".<ref name=\"Graeme\">{{cite journal | url=http://oq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/13/4/204 | last=Graeme | first=Roland | title=''The Tsar's Bride''.

Marfa is already beloved of the boyar Lykov.  In a jealous rage against Lykov, Gryaznoi arranges to cast a spell on Marfa with a magic potion from Bomelius, the Tsar's physician.  Lyubasha has overheard Gryaznoi's request.\n\n===Act 2: The Love Philtre===\nLyubasha in turn obtains from Bomelius another magic potion with which to cancel any feelings of Gryaznoi for Marfa.  Bomelius consents, but at the price of an assignation with Lyubasha for himself.\n\n===Act 3: The Best Man===\nIn the meantime, the Tsar of the title, [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]] (known as \"Ivan the Terrible\"), is looking for a new bride from the best aristocratic maidens in Russia, through the newly adopted custom of [[bride-show]].  The Tsar settles upon Marfa.  At the celebration of the engagement of Marfa to Lykov, everyone is surprised when the news arrives of the Tsar's choice of Marfa as his bride.  Gryaznoi had slipped what he thought was the love potion from Bomelius into Marfa's drink at the feast.\n\n===Act 4: The Bride===\nAt the Tsar's palace, Marfa has become violently ill.  Lykov has been executed, at the instigation of Gryaznoi, on charges of attempting to kill Marfa.  When Marfa learns that Lykov is dead, she goes insane.  Eventually, Gryaznoi admits that he had slipped a potion into her drink, and after learning that it was poisonous, asks that he himself be executed.  Lyubasha then confesses that she had substituted her potion from Bomelius for Gryaznoi's.  In a rage, Gryaznoi murders Lyubasha, and is then taken to prison eventually to be executed.  In her madness, Marfa mistakes Gryaznoi for Lykov, inviting him to return the next day to visit her, then dies.\n\n==Important musical excerpts==\n*Overture\n*Gryaznoy's Recitative and Aria (Act I)\n*Lyubasha's Song (Act I)\n*Marfa's Aria (Act IV)\n\n==Recordings==\n'''Audio'''<ref name=\"OPDIS\">[http://www.operadis-opera-discography.org.uk/CLRITSAR.HTM#7   Recordings of the opera listed on operadis-opera-discography.org]  Retrieved 19 August 2013</ref>\n[[File:Ivan Bilibin 167.jpg|300px|thumb|A 1930 stage design by [[Ivan Bilibin]]]]\n*1943: Natalya Shpiller, Maxim Mikhailov, Piotr Medtviediev, Anatoly Lioubimov, Anatoly Orfionov, Maria Maksakova, Vassily Yakouchenko, [[Sofya Panova]], Varvara Gagarina, Maria Levina, Bronislav Zielezinsky; Chorus and Orchestra of the Bolshoi Theatre; [[Lev Steinberg]], conductor (1943 recording) Dante Productions LYS 055/56:<ref name=\"Graeme\"/>\n*1958: Sobakin \u2014 Alexandr Vedernikov, Marfa \u2014 Yelizaveta Shumskaya, Gryaznoy \u2014 Alexey Ivanov, L\u00efkov \u2014 Andrey Sokolov, Lyubasha \u2014 [[Veronika Borisenko]], Saburova \u2014 Tatyana Tugarinova, Chorus and Orchestra of the Bolshoi Theatre; [[Yevgeny Svetlanov]], conductor\n*1975: [[Galina Vishnevskaya]], Irina Arkhipova, Vladimir Valaitis, [[Yevgeny Nesterenko]], Andrei Sokolov, Vladimir Atlantov; Chorus and Orchestra of the Bolshoi Theatre; [[Fuat Mansurov]], conductor.<ref>Anderson, Robert, \"Record Reviews: The Tsar's Bride\" (January 1975) HMV SLS 885 (LP issue):.

The [[libretto]], by [[Ilia Tyumenev]], is based on the [[The Tsar's Bride|drama of the same name]] by [[Lev Mey]].  Mey's play was first suggested to the composer as an opera subject in 1868 by [[Mily Balakirev]].  ([[Alexander Borodin]], too, once toyed with the idea.)  However, the opera was not composed until thirty years later, in 1898.  The first performance of the opera took place in 1899 at the Moscow theater of the Private Opera of S.I. Mamontov.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov himself said of the opera that he intended it as a reaction against the ideas of [[Richard Wagner]], and to be in the style of \"cantilena ''par excellence''\".<ref name=\"Graeme\">{{cite journal | url=http://oq.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/13/4/204 | last=Graeme | first=Roland | title=''The Tsar's Bride''.
