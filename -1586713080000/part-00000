It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\n[[File:SoG 1.jpg|thumb|upright=2|City defences during the siege in 1643]]\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988a para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\n[[File:SoG 2.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Royalist dispositions during the siege]]\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n\nBy the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Meanwhile Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref> The next day the two forces clashed. Although Rupert enjoyed superior numbers, he was dissuaded from pressing his advantage by the appearance of [[Edmund Harvey]] with a regiment of Parliamentarian cavalry and two of infantry. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to the area of [[Andoversford]] and [[Compton Abdale]], while Essex's army ended the day around [[Naunton]]. Rupert had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 144\u2013147, 148</ref>\n\nIn Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted reinforcements from Bristol. The defender's countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into [[blockhouse]]s. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nOn 5 September Essex took the quickest way off the open country of the Cotswold hills down into the relative safety of the Severn valley. This meant descending the steep escarpment at Prestbury Hill towards [[Cheltenham]], rather than heading directly to Gloucester. His lead elements began the difficult descent at dusk, but the baggage train and rearguard were forced to spend the night in worsening weather in the hills. Rupert, who appears to have expected a more direct march on Gloucester, was not in a position to harass the Parliamentarians, and returned to Gloucester. There he covered the Royalist army as it lifted the siege and withdrew to Matson, {{convert|2|mi|km}} south-east of the city. Charles had already departed his headquarters there and ridden ahead to [[Painswick]]. The defenders inside the city did not know how close Essex was and, not quite believing the siege was over, did not harry the retreating Royalists but remained vigilant behind their defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 148\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nRoyalist casualties during the siege were claimed to be in the range of 1,000 to over 1,500, the Parliamentarian losses ranging from 30 to 50. Royalist sources concede 120 killed during the siege, with reports of sick and wounded giving numbers of 900, 400 and 300. [[Jon Day]] gives a conservative estimate of Royalist casualties as 1,200 killed, wounded and sick, with another 800 lost to desertion.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 155, 168</ref> The siege had come close to succeeding, and by the end of it the defenders were down to their last barrels of gunpowder. It is unlikely they would have been able to withstand an assault, but because of Charles's aversion to casualties, none was ever attempted. Massey's aggressive tactics were a critical factor in the successful defence of the city, and ensured that morale never dropped to the low levels witnessed before the siege began. The Royalists specifically identified his countermining as the reason for lifting the siege. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate to the task of siege work, and the 300\u2013400 large cannon balls and 20+ mortar bombs that were fired on the city failed to blow any major breach in the walls, start any significant fires or cause more than a handful of casualties.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nAlthough the failure at Gloucester adversely affected Royalist morale, the campaign presented Charles with an opportunity to inflict a decisive blow against his enemy. The Parliamentarian army and its trained band reserves had effectively been lured out of a strong position behind the London defences, into open country where they could be more easily defeated. Against a Parliamentarian army some 14,500 strong, the Royalist army of 9,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry was slightly inferior in the quantity of infantry but superior in cavalry by a factor of three to two. The arrival of additional guns ordered from Oxford during the siege gave the Royalists parity in artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 165, 167\u2013168</ref>\n\nEssex's objective after the siege was to evade the Royalist army and return his own intact to London. In a feint designed to draw Charles away from his intended route back to London, Essex marched north to [[Tewkesbury]], where he could better supply his army and threaten Royalist Worcester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 171\u2013172</ref> When Charles marched his army after him, Essex retraced his steps back to Cheltenham. With the Royalists concentrated around [[Evesham]] and [[Pershore]], he struck out back across the Cotswolds in the direction of Cirencester, where he defeated the 400-strong Royalist garrison on 16 September.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 175, 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nEssex believed he had etablished a commanding lead over Charles and, not wishing to drive his hungry army too hard, slowed his pace on the march to [[Swindon]].<ref>Day 2007 pp. 184\u2013185</ref> He was further slowed after Swindon when Rupert's cavalry caught up, and the resulting [[Battle of Aldbourne Chase]] on 18 September allowed the rest of the Royalist army to close the distance.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 186\u2013192</ref> Charles finally brought Essex to battle on 20 September in the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to defeat him, allowing the Parliamentarians to reach the safety of their London stronghold four days later.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 226, 269, 280</ref>\n\nGloucester resumed its role as a logistic base for local operations and remained a Parliamentarian centre for the rest of the war, though Massey was removed as governor in 1645 over suspicions about his loyalty. By 1649 the burden of maintaining the garrison was generating divisions within the city. In 1651 a Scottish army moved south in support of the Royalists, prompting the city to restore its fortifications and raise a new town regiment. The garrison was withdrawn two years later, but in 1659, the city became increasingly divided as support for Parliament dissipated. Pury raised 300 troops to defend Gloucester for Parliament, while Massey, now a Royalist, plotted its capture. As the war came to an end in 1660 Massey returned to and was elected as the member of parliament for Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 156</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nProfessor [[David Daube]] suggested in ''[[The Oxford Magazine]]'' of 16 February 1956 that the nursery rhyme [[Humpty Dumpty]] originated from a [[siege engine]] used at Gloucester, based on a contemporary account of the attack, but without evidence that the rhyme was connected.<ref>Daube 2009 pp. 365\u2013366.</ref> The theory was part of an anonymous series of articles on the origin of nursery rhymes and was widely acclaimed in academia,<ref>Rodger 1999</ref> but it was derided by others as \"ingenuity for ingenuity's sake\" and declared to be a spoof.<ref>Opie 1997 p. 254</ref><ref>Opie 2004 p. 76.</ref>\n\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\n[[File:SoG 1.jpg|thumb|upright=2|City defences during the siege in 1643]]\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\n[[File:SoG 2.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Royalist dispositions during the siege]]\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n\nBy the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Meanwhile Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref> The next day the two forces clashed. Although Rupert enjoyed superior numbers, he was dissuaded from pressing his advantage by the appearance of [[Edmund Harvey]] with a regiment of Parliamentarian cavalry and two of infantry. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to the area of [[Andoversford]] and [[Compton Abdale]], while Essex's army ended the day around [[Naunton]]. Rupert had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 144\u2013147, 148</ref>\n\nIn Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted reinforcements from Bristol. The defender's countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into [[blockhouse]]s. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nOn 5 September Essex took the quickest way off the open country of the Cotswold hills down into the relative safety of the Severn valley. This meant descending the steep escarpment at Prestbury Hill towards [[Cheltenham]], rather than heading directly to Gloucester. His lead elements began the difficult descent at dusk, but the baggage train and rearguard were forced to spend the night in worsening weather in the hills. Rupert, who appears to have expected a more direct march on Gloucester, was not in a position to harass the Parliamentarians, and returned to Gloucester. There he covered the Royalist army as it lifted the siege and withdrew to Matson, {{convert|2|mi|km}} south-east of the city. Charles had already departed his headquarters there and ridden ahead to [[Painswick]]. The defenders inside the city did not know how close Essex was and, not quite believing the siege was over, did not harry the retreating Royalists but remained vigilant behind their defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 148\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nRoyalist casualties during the siege were claimed to be in the range of 1,000 to over 1,500, the Parliamentarian losses ranging from 30 to 50. Royalist sources concede 120 killed during the siege, with reports of sick and wounded giving numbers of 900, 400 and 300. [[Jon Day]] gives a conservative estimate of Royalist casualties as 1,200 killed, wounded and sick, with another 800 lost to desertion.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 155, 168</ref> The siege had come close to succeeding, and by the end of it the defenders were down to their last barrels of gunpowder. It is unlikely they would have been able to withstand an assault, but because of Charles's aversion to casualties, none was ever attempted. Massey's aggressive tactics were a critical factor in the successful defence of the city, and ensured that morale never dropped to the low levels witnessed before the siege began. The Royalists specifically identified his countermining as the reason for lifting the siege. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate to the task of siege work, and the 300\u2013400 large cannon balls and 20+ mortar bombs that were fired on the city failed to blow any major breach in the walls, start any significant fires or cause more than a handful of casualties.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nAlthough the failure at Gloucester adversely affected Royalist morale, the campaign presented Charles with an opportunity to inflict a decisive blow against his enemy. The Parliamentarian army and its trained band reserves had effectively been lured out of a strong position behind the London defences, into open country where they could be more easily defeated. Against a Parliamentarian army some 14,500 strong, the Royalist army of 9,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry was slightly inferior in the quantity of infantry but superior in cavalry by a factor of three to two. The arrival of additional guns ordered from Oxford during the siege gave the Royalists parity in artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 165, 167\u2013168</ref>\n\nEssex's objective after the siege was to evade the Royalist army and return his own intact to London. In a feint designed to draw Charles away from his intended route back to London, Essex marched north to [[Tewkesbury]], where he could better supply his army and threaten Royalist Worcester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 171\u2013172</ref> When Charles marched his army after him, Essex retraced his steps back to Cheltenham. With the Royalists concentrated around [[Evesham]] and [[Pershore]], he struck out back across the Cotswolds in the direction of Cirencester, where he defeated the 400-strong Royalist garrison on 16 September.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 175, 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nEssex believed he had etablished a commanding lead over Charles and, not wishing to drive his hungry army too hard, slowed his pace on the march to [[Swindon]].<ref>Day 2007 pp. 184\u2013185</ref> He was further slowed after Swindon when Rupert's cavalry caught up, and the resulting [[Battle of Aldbourne Chase]] on 18 September allowed the rest of the Royalist army to close the distance.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 186\u2013192</ref> Charles finally brought Essex to battle on 20 September in the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to defeat him, allowing the Parliamentarians to reach the safety of their London stronghold four days later.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 226, 269, 280</ref>\n\nGloucester resumed its role as a logistic base for local operations and remained a Parliamentarian centre for the rest of the war, though Massey was removed as governor in 1645 over suspicions about his loyalty. By 1649 the burden of maintaining the garrison was generating divisions within the city. In 1651 a Scottish army moved south in support of the Royalists, prompting the city to restore its fortifications and raise a new town regiment. The garrison was withdrawn two years later, but in 1659, the city became increasingly divided as support for Parliament dissipated. Pury raised 300 troops to defend Gloucester for Parliament, while Massey, now a Royalist, plotted its capture. As the war came to an end in 1660 Massey returned to and was elected as the member of parliament for Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 156</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nProfessor [[David Daube]] suggested in ''[[The Oxford Magazine]]'' of 16 February 1956 that the nursery rhyme [[Humpty Dumpty]] originated from a [[siege engine]] used at Gloucester, based on a contemporary account of the attack, but without evidence that the rhyme was connected.<ref>Daube 2009 pp. 365\u2013366.</ref> The theory was part of an anonymous series of articles on the origin of nursery rhymes and was widely acclaimed in academia,<ref>Rodger 1999</ref> but it was derided by others as \"ingenuity for ingenuity's sake\" and declared to be a spoof.<ref>Opie 1997 p. 254</ref><ref>Opie 2004 p. 76.</ref>\n\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

Stefan gradually improved over the course of his first six car races and finished the six-race mini-series in ninth place, also ending as top rookie. He picked up three top-six finishes and set fastest lap in the final round at Brands Hatch.\n\n[[File:Stefan Wilson 2008 British F3 Croft.jpg|thumb|left|Wilson driving for [[Fluid Motorsport]] at the [[Croft Circuit|Croft]] round of the [[2008 British Formula 3 season]].]]\n\nStefan competed in the 2007 Formula Palmer Audi Championship, the 10th anniversary of the series and also the 10th anniversary of when his brother Justin won the first FPA title. He finished 2nd in the championship after a great final round at Croft, where he scored 2 podiums after his worst qualifying of the season, only starting 7th and 9th for the two races. Stefan overtook a total of 11 cars. He also closed the final gap between him and more experienced driver Tim Bridgman to just 28 points.\n\nHe scored 4 wins over the course of the season; the first came in round 4 of the championship at the [[Brands Hatch]] Grand Prix circuit in front of nearly 50,000 spectators. The second half of Wilson's championship was more successful as he scored 4 pole positions and 3 of his 4 wins. Wilson ended the championship in 2nd place, with a tally of 4 wins, 9 podiums, 4 pole positions, 5 fastest laps, and 2 lap records.\n\nAt the end of the season he won the [[McLaren Autosport BRDC Award]] for young British drivers. Part of the award was a prize drive in a [[McLaren]] [[Formula One]] car, which took place on the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] National Circuit on 13 November 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Glendenning|first=Mark|title=Wilson gets prize Formula 1 test|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|work=autosport.com|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/80151|date=13 November 2009|accessdate=13 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 he competed in the [[British Formula 3 Championship]] National Class in 2008 with [[Fluid Motorsport]] and captured 4 class wins on his way to 4th in the National Class points standings.\n\n===Indy Lights===\nWilson signed to race a partial schedule in [[Firestone Indy Lights]] in 2009 for [[First Motorsports]] with cars prepared by [[Walker Racing]] that included six road and street courses. He qualified third at [[Long Beach Grand Prix|Long Beach]] but was sidelined by a mechanical problem towards the finish. His best finish was fourth in the wet/dry race at [[Honda Indy Toronto|Toronto]]. In 2010 returned to the series to race for [[Bryan Herta Autosport]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.motorsport.com/indylights/news/bryan-herta-autosport-signs-stefan-wilson/|title = Bryan Herta Autosport signs Stefan Wilson|date = 3 February 2010|accessdate = 24 August 2015|website = motorsport.com|publisher = via [[Bryan Herta Autosport]]}}</ref> Wilson finished 11th in points despite missing one race due to funding issues and another due to a damaged racecar. He had a career-best finish of third in the season opener at [[Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg|St. Pete]] and ran the fastest race lap in [[Honda Indy Toronto|Toronto]].\n\nIn [[2011 Indy Lights season|2011]] he returned to Indy Lights full-time with [[Andretti Autosport]]. He captured one pole, two wins, and finished on the podium three more times to finish third in the championship. Despite Wilson's 2011 success he was out of racing until the [[2012 Indy Lights season]] finale at [[Auto Club Speedway]] where he drove for [[Fan Force United]] and finished sixth.\n\n===IndyCar===\nWilson made his IndyCar debut at the [[2013 IndyCar Series season|2013]] [[Grand Prix of Baltimore]] driving for [[Dale Coyne Racing]], finishing sixteenth. His brother Justin drove the other full-time entry for Dale Coyne Racing, making the Wilson brothers the first pair of brothers to drive in IndyCar for the same team since [[Gary Bettenhausen]] and [[Tony Bettenhausen, Jr.]] drove for their family team in 1983.\n\nIn June 2014 Fan Force United announced that they had signed Wilson for the team's full-time step up to the IndyCar Series in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/114667 |title=Stefan Wilson gets 2015 IndyCar deal with Fan Force United |last1=Glendenning |first1=Mark|date=27 June 2014 |website=[[autosport.com]] |accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref> However, this entry ultimately did not materialize.\n\nOn 26 April 2016 it was announced that Wilson will be driving for KV Racing Technology at the 100th Running of the [[Indianapolis 500]]. Wilson will be driving the No. 25 Driven2SaveLives Chevy. He chose No. 25 in honor of his late brother Justin, who drove the No. 25 car when he received his fatal injuries during an incident at the [[2015 ABC Supply 500]].\n\nWilson nearly won the [[2018 Indianapolis 500]], but ran out of fuel with four laps to go, handing the victory to [[Will Power]].\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Career history===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

Part of the award was a prize drive in a [[McLaren]] [[Formula One]] car, which took place on the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] National Circuit on 13 November 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last=Glendenning|first=Mark|title=Wilson gets prize Formula 1 test|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|work=autosport.com|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/80151|date=13 November 2009|accessdate=13 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 he competed in the [[British Formula 3 Championship]] National Class in 2008 with [[Fluid Motorsport]] and captured 4 class wins on his way to 4th in the National Class points standings.\n\n===Indy Lights===\nWilson signed to race a partial schedule in [[Firestone Indy Lights]] in 2009 for [[First Motorsports]] with cars prepared by [[Walker Racing]] that included six road and street courses. He qualified third at [[Long Beach Grand Prix|Long Beach]] but was sidelined by a mechanical problem towards the finish. His best finish was fourth in the wet/dry race at [[Honda Indy Toronto|Toronto]]. In 2010 returned to the series to race for [[Bryan Herta Autosport]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.motorsport.com/indylights/news/bryan-herta-autosport-signs-stefan-wilson/|title = Bryan Herta Autosport signs Stefan Wilson|date = 3 February 2010|accessdate = 24 August 2015|website = motorsport.com|publisher = via [[Bryan Herta Autosport]]}}</ref> Wilson finished 11th in points despite missing one race due to funding issues and another due to a damaged racecar. He had a career-best finish of third in the season opener at [[Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg|St. Pete]] and ran the fastest race lap in [[Honda Indy Toronto|Toronto]].\n\nIn [[2011 Indy Lights season|2011]] he returned to Indy Lights full-time with [[Andretti Autosport]]. He captured one pole, two wins, and finished on the podium three more times to finish third in the championship. Despite Wilson's 2011 success he was out of racing until the [[2012 Indy Lights season]] finale at [[Auto Club Speedway]] where he drove for [[Fan Force United]] and finished sixth.\n\n===IndyCar===\nWilson made his IndyCar debut at the [[2013 IndyCar Series season|2013]] [[Grand Prix of Baltimore]] driving for [[Dale Coyne Racing]], finishing sixteenth. His brother Justin drove the other full-time entry for Dale Coyne Racing, making the Wilson brothers the first pair of brothers to drive in IndyCar for the same team since [[Gary Bettenhausen]] and [[Tony Bettenhausen, Jr.]] drove for their family team in 1983.\n\nIn June 2014 Fan Force United announced that they had signed Wilson for the team's full-time step up to the IndyCar Series in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/114667 |title=Stefan Wilson gets 2015 IndyCar deal with Fan Force United |last1=Glendenning |first1=Mark|date=27 June 2014 |website=[[autosport.com]] |accessdate=2 July 2014}}</ref> However, this entry ultimately did not materialize.\n\nOn 26 April 2016 it was announced that Wilson will be driving for KV Racing Technology at the 100th Running of the [[Indianapolis 500]]. Wilson will be driving the No. 25 Driven2SaveLives Chevy. He chose No. 25 in honor of his late brother Justin, who drove the No. 25 car when he received his fatal injuries during an incident at the [[2015 ABC Supply 500]].\n\nWilson nearly won the [[2018 Indianapolis 500]], but ran out of fuel with four laps to go, handing the victory to [[Will Power]].\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Career history===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

Flenderson'''<ref>{{cite episode|title=[[Counseling (The Office)|Counseling]]|series=[[The Office (American TV series)|The Office]]|airdate=September 30, 2010|network=[[NBC]]}}</ref> is a fictional character on the [[United States of America|U.S.]] [[comedy]] [[television series]], ''[[The Office (US TV series)|The Office]]''. He is portrayed by [[Paul Lieberstein]], who was also the show's [[writer]], [[television director|director]], [[television producer|producer]] and [[showrunner]]. He is the human resources representative at the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] branch of the paper distribution company, [[Dunder Mifflin]]. Toby is an original character with no counterpart in [[The Office (British TV series)|the original British series]].\n\n==Overview==\nToby Flenderson is the [[human resources]] representative for the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] branch of paper distributor [[Dunder Mifflin]]/Sabre. Mild-mannered to the point of being physically incapable of voicing his opinions or asserting himself, Toby can be somewhat mournful about his life choices (he fell into the field of Human Resources after leaving his training at [[seminary]] in order to pursue the woman he would later marry and painfully divorce). He likes his colleagues, although he is sometimes exasperated by the excessively chatty [[Kelly Kapoor]]. He also has a long-standing crush on [[Pam Beesly]], which he almost reveals at the end of Season 4 when he resigns from his position to move to [[Costa Rica]]. Toby was intensely despised by branch manager [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]], largely because Michael had no authority over him as Toby reported to corporate headquarters, and because Toby frequently tried to dissuade Michael from many of his ill-conceived and impulsive ideas. Michael sums up his feelings for Toby in the episode \"[[Casino Night]]\", asking, \"Why are you the way that you are? Honestly every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be.\" For Toby's going away party in \"[[Goodbye Toby]]\", Michael gives him as a gift a rock with a note attached reading \"Suck on This!\" Shortly after arriving in Costa Rica, Toby suffers a [[zip-line]] accident and midway through season 5, he returns to his old job at Dunder Mifflin, much to Michael's fury.\n\n==Biography==\nIn his childhood, Toby was forced to testify against both of his parents when the two got divorced. He attended [[Bishop O'Hara High School]] and is a [[Penn State University]] alumnus. In the Season 5 episode \"[[Casual Friday (The Office)|Casual Friday]]\", a diploma at his cubicle reveals Toby also has a B.S. in psychology from California Coastal College. The Season 7 episode \"[[Counseling (The Office)|Counseling]]\" reveals he has a degree in [[social work]] from [[Temple University]]. Toby was in a seminary for a year but dropped out when he met his future wife. The two moved to Scranton and had a daughter named Sasha. They later [[divorce]]d. Toby loves his daughter and went the extra mile in \"[[Moroccan Christmas]]\" to buy her one of Dwight's Princess Unicorn dolls from [[Darryl Philbin]], noting that his ex-wife \"will be so pissed\" and that \"for once, Daddy's going to be a hero.\" However Darryl bought an African-American doll. When Darryl asks if the doll is okay, Toby says \"It's even better than the one I wanted.\" <!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TobyFlenderson.jpg|left|210px|thumb|Toby]] -->\n\nToby claims to have no \"passion for HR\" and was only hired at Dunder Mifflin as it was the first job he could find. He joins the others occasionally but only for business matters, such as reviewing the company's [[sexual harassment]] policy and mediating conflict between employees. Toby prefers to let angry employees vent to him, after which they feel better and the conflict eventually settles down and solves itself. This strategy worked virtually trouble-free for years until [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] publicly reads off all listed complaints.\n\nToby tries (but usually fails) to enforce corporate policies and rules when Michael disregards them, typified by an incident in which he quashes Michael's plan to invite [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] to a Casino Night party:\n{{cquote|Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's, uh, you know...there's gambling and alcohol...and it's in our dangerous warehouse...it's a school night, and you know, uh... [[Hooters]] is catering. You know, is that not\u2014is that enough? Should I keep going?}}\n\nToby usually avoids office activities whenever possible and, like most of the staff, only tolerates Michael. He has reached out to Michael several times despite Michael's continued abuse. He gets along with the rest of the staff. When Dwight approached Michael about missing a gift bag during \"[[A Benihana Christmas]]\", Michael suggested stealing it from Toby, much to Toby's later chagrin, as all the office staff had new robes except for him (Pam later gave her robe to Toby, and this increased Toby's unrequited crush on her). Michael on numerous occasions attempts to blame Toby for problems that are clearly his own fault such as in \"[[The Merger (The Office)|The Merger]]\" in which he questions Tony Gardner if he is quitting because of Toby. In \"[[Classy Christmas]]\" Michael vandalizes Holly's Woody doll (a gift from her boyfriend) and tries to convince her Toby did it. Toby denies it and says the vandalism is something Michael would do.\n\nHe seems to have plain bad luck in many instances. He seems to accept this way of life as inescapable, which may be the cause of his sad disposition. On some occasions, Toby enjoys some rewards and good fortune, much to his satisfaction (and to Michael's annoyance).\n\nToby's favorite movies are ''[[Say Anything...]]'', ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', ''[[Annie Hall]]'', and ''[[Toy Story 2]]''.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/10/27/tv-squad-visits-the-set-of-the-office/ | title = TV Squad Visits the Set of: The Office | last = Kelly | first = Kevin | work = TV Squad | date = 2006-10-27 | accessdate = 2007-02-04 }}</ref> He also likes short stories, mystery novels, and \"old hard-boiled detective\" movies. One of his favorite TV shows is ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]''.\n\nHe lived in [[Honolulu]] for a year and stated in \"[[Branch Closing]]\" that he would take severance from the closing, sell his house, and move to [[Costa Rica]]. In \"[[Local Ad]]\", it is revealed that he worked in advertising for three years before coming to Dunder Mifflin. According to a deleted scene from the episode \"[[Launch Party]]\", he is [[colorblind]]. Toby is also allergic to mushrooms (\"[[Survivor Man]]\").\n\nToby has an ongoing concern about the air quality at the office that borders on an obsession. He worked a recommendation that the air be tested into his goodbye toast in a deleted scene from \"[[Goodbye, Toby]];\" he ignored the two factions that wanted to use an unexpected surplus for new chairs or a new copier and said the money should go to air testing; and he put together a meeting to discuss the radon testing kits he was dispersing in \"[[The Chump (The Office)|The Chump]].\"\n\n==Relationships==\n\nToby is seen as an awkward and quiet guy in the office. He is often passive when he is teased or when he gets picked on and does not appear to know how to stand up for himself. While members of the office have shown disgust at Michael's treatment of Toby, for unknown reasons, nobody has ever stood up for Toby when Michael insults him or excludes him from events, but he is generally liked in the office. The others possibly avoid standing up for him as Michael has authority over them (unlike Toby) and could potentially punish them for speaking up or possibly because they do not want to suffer the same treatment Toby suffers from Michael. Toby, however, has never asked anyone for help when Michael mistreats him, which is possibly the reason why no one ever stands up for him.\n\nBesides Michael, the other staff members treat Toby with respect,  for example, after Toby conducts a brief sexual harassment seminar, the staff is left in a good mood and laughing, until Michael comes in and takes over, however there have been others who occasionally like Michael treat him poorly, insult him and lose their patience such as Kevin, Dwight and Jim and in later seasons, Andy and Nellie. Toby himself is occasionally an annoyance to some, such as Jim, but despite this he is considered one of the few intelligent people in the office, being in the \"Finer Things Club\" with Pam and Oscar. His behavior does change somewhat when he meets Nellie (whom he develops a romance for), and he is shown to become somewhat of nuisance to her by being socially awkward and not handling his crush on her with any subtlety (and also an annoyance to Andy, though this is more of a Michael Scott-like situation where Andy gets angry and frustrated at Toby for doing his HR job at the expense of Andy's weirder/less legal ideas).\n\n===Michael===\n\nMichael despises Toby because, according to Michael, his job is to \"make the office fun, while [Toby's] job is to make the office lame\". Michael's often-successful self-delusions that he is the life of the party frequently have a light shined on them by Toby's interactions with him. This is usually not Toby's intention, but his inability to go along with Michael's vibe is like a mirror being held up to Michael. It shows him the truth that he is constantly hiding from. In their bitter relationship, Michael is clearly the antagonist and Toby the victim. Michael seems to be completely blind to how harsh his treatment of Toby is and claims that Toby is the bad guy and that he tortures him (he points this out to Holly in \"Goodbye Toby\"), completely ignoring that he verbally puts Toby down on a daily basis while the latter simply does his job and voices his own opinion and attempts to dissuade Michael from ideas that are truly reckless and impulsive and unethical in the office. Even on occasions where Toby offers kindness to Michael such as in \"The Deposition\" and \"Niagara\", Michael shows nothing but rudeness and hatred.\n\nMichael viewed Toby as his sworn enemy and took every opportunity to demean him. As Michael sneers, \"Toby is in [[human resources|HR]], which technically means he works for corporate, so he's really not a part of our family. Also, he's divorced, so he's really not a part of ''his'' family\" and says that \"Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry.\" He also stated, \"I hate so much about the things that you choose to be\" (immediately following the above quote from Toby regarding the Casino Night). At various times, Michael has referred to Toby as \"the worst human being ever\", a \"convicted rapist\", \"evil snail\", \"animal rapist\", \"[[Satan]]\" and \"the [[Antichrist]].\" Michael once says that if he \"had a gun with two bullets and was in a room with [[Hitler]], [[Osama bin Laden|Bin Laden]] and Toby, [he] would shoot Toby twice.\" Michael has physically hurt Toby on a few occasions as well such as throwing a pen at his forehead and checking him while skating.\n\nMichael frequently threatened to fire Toby, which he could not do because Toby is not considered a local branch employee, having been hired by the corporate office and then assigned to Scranton. The majority of Michael's techniques that are questionable bring Toby by his own obligation to confront Michael about how corporate would like him to do his job. Ultimately Toby and Michael represent the conflict between employees and upper management. While Toby is mainly a passive victim to Michael's abuse who tries his best to remain calm, Toby himself has shown on a few occasions in the series that he enjoys seeing Michael in misery such as when he injures his foot and collapses and struggles in the restroom (where Michael is disgusted by the idea of Toby helping him instead of Ryan, and Toby gets to mock Michael's wimpiness and notes with disdain \"you only grilled your foot\") and when Toby viciously beats Michael in a game of poker, in which he says he will chase the feeling of taking Michael's money. Toby has also laughed at Michael's misfortune on occasion such as in \"The Deposition\" when Toby learns that Michael thinks Ryan is hot and also in \"Koi Pond\" when he learns Michael has fallen into two fountains. Toby once even instructed Pam on how to hit Michael harder after he gave her the opportunity to do so for dating and dumping her mother, showing that he enjoys seeing Michael suffer to a degree. Toby has on occasion stood up to Michael such as in \"Classy Christmas\" when Michael tries to accuse Toby of destroying Holly's beloved Woody doll, to which Toby immediately responds that the vandalism is something that Michael would do, to which everyone agrees. Toby seems to have a strong ability to absorb Michael's abuse as seen in \"Goodbye Toby\" where he is given a potential opportunity to complain about Michael's antics and after Michael threatens to kill him (though he does so in a situation where Holly and Pam would be able to listen to Toby's issues if he wanted to present them, as they either do not know how awful Michael has been to him or, in Pam's case, know it very well), Toby claims that everything in the office is fine, and later shrugs to the camera that he has survived Michael's abuse long enough and that disclosing it is pointless. Toby has never attempted in any way to get Michael punished for his harsh treatment of him (despite having the power to do so) and has never gotten angry with him for unknown reasons. This stands in direct contrast to other members of the Office who get angered at Michael for his stupidity and rudeness such as Jim, Pam, and (notably) Stanley. Toby also somewhat seems to be in denial that Michael hates him as seen in \"[[New Guys]]\" in which after shooting down his impulsive idea, Andy says to Toby: \"Now I know why Michael hated you so much\", to which Toby responds \"No, he didn't\", possibly signifying that Toby does not view Michael's abuse as hatred. Michael himself has even shown shock at Toby's passive attitude to his abusive actions, notably seen in \"Frame Toby\" when after he and Dwight attempt to frame Toby for being a marijuana user in order to get him fired, Michael actually feels true guilt and attempts to stop it though is absolutely shocked after the situation is resolved when Toby expresses anger for them wasting the cop's time, all the while completely ignoring the fact that he potentially could have been arrested and fired from his job, possibly showing that Michael also hates Toby for allowing himself to be abused and not standing up for himself.\n\nToby seems to want Michael's friendship but is too shy to talk to him about it. In \"[[The Lover (The Office)|The Lover]]\", Michael opens up to Toby, asking him to keep Pam under control, by giving Toby a hug and calling him a \"good guy.\" Toby says that he is delighted and \"Michael would like me once he got to know me\", but as soon as Toby fails to keep Pam under control, Michael starts to hate him again. Michael, though, ended up being appreciative of Toby's efforts to actually help him during their Sabre-mandated counseling sessions (even if he spent much of the time hurling harsh statements at the HR rep), to the point where he decided to talk to Toby instead of simply signing off on a few corrected forms at the sessions' end. While in \"Take Your Daughter to Work Day\", Michael ends up bonding with Toby's daughter Sasha when the employees bring their children into the office. However, later on, Michael becomes withdrawn and sad that he has not had any children, which Toby senses and ends up being confidant to Michael. Michael inquires about being Sasha's godfather. Toby simply tells him that she already has one. Michael has on a few occasions realized when his mistreatment of Toby has gone too far such as in \"[[Women's Appreciation]]\" in which he literally asked him to expose his genitals and also in the aforementioned \"Frame Toby\" after attempting to get Toby arrested and fired, possibly showing that Michael's hatred of Toby has limits.\n\nIn \"[[Goodbye, Michael]]\", when Michael wants to give everyone in the office a proper goodbye, he somewhat makes up for all the times he has berated and insulted Toby by listening to him without insulting him once, possibly showing that he will miss Toby somewhat. However, his face betrays both his difficulty in doing so and his horror when an appreciative Toby suggests that Michael look up Toby's brother Rory in Boulder once he has settled himself in Colorado. This can be viewed as Michael's final comeuppance for his treatment of Toby as even though he is moving away to Colorado, he will still not escape Toby and will have to endure annoyance from Toby's brother Rory (who seems to be virtually identical to him and whom Toby encourages to be friends with Michael).\n\n===Pam===\nPam and Toby are shown to have a good relationship. Pam has shown much displeasure at Michael's harsh treatment of Toby. Toby has had a crush on Pam ever since she called off her wedding with Roy and Jim went to Stamford, but he is too shy to tell her his feelings. In \"[[Cocktails (The Office)|Cocktails]]\" Toby spends his whole evening trying to win a stuffed animal duck at a claw machine for her. When he finally wins, Pam gives back the stuffed animal and asks, \"Don't you have a daughter?\" In \"[[Dunder Mifflin Infinity]]\" Toby is the first to find out about Jim and Pam's relationship when he sees her kiss him on the cheek in the break room. Upset about Pam's new relationship, he sends out a memo asking for no personal displays of affection in the office. In the episode \"[[Business School (The Office)|Business School]]\", Pam asks Toby to come to her art show, and he says he cannot make it because of his daughter's play. He then gets really upset and yells, \"Damn it!\" and questions if maybe he does not have to go to see his daughter's play and instead could go see Pam's art show.\n\nIn \"[[Night Out (The Office episode)|Night Out]]\", Pam thinks that a joke Toby told was funny, and he gets really excited and puts his hand on her leg. After an awkward silence, Toby announces his move to Costa Rica. While shocked that he touched her, Pam does not appear to be angered at Toby for this in subsequent episodes. In \"[[Goodbye, Toby]]\" Pam gives to Toby an office picture of the staff that excludes her (because she took the picture herself) for when he leaves for Costa Rica. Toby, unsatisfied by the lack of her presence, shouts at the office staff asking for a camera (possibly the loudest he has ever spoken). When no one responds, he runs off for an extended amount of time just to find a camera to have a picture of her and him together. Pam also helps Toby take revenge against Michael in this episode after his insulting farewell gift is exposed during a meeting and she gets him to unwillingly give up his watch to Toby. At the end of the episode, Pam comments (though not to Toby) that she always thought he was kind of cute and that she will miss him a lot.\n\nIn \"[[Niagara (The Office)|Niagara]]\" Toby appears to still have feelings for Pam and is happy when they run out on their wedding. He is later disappointed when the wedding is called back on but is seen smiling and clapping after they're married and run down the aisle. In \"Double Date\", Toby instructs Pam on how to punch Michael even harder for revenge for him dating and dumping her mother, which Pam appears to appreciate. During \"[[Roy's Wedding]]\", while Jim and Pam are trying to find out if there is anything they do not know about each other, Toby correctly answers facts about Pam. Everyone notices him, and Toby, clearly embarrassed, attempts to cover it up. There have been a few occasions when Pam has mistreated Toby somewhat such as hanging up on him on the phone after Toby gave her helpful advice and telling him to get out of the room before Michael (stressed over a breakup) arrives and notably in \"Paper Airplane\" after hitting him in the eye with a paper airplane and getting angry at him for crossing (to which Toby apologizes). Pam in response does not apologize and simply asks whether she is still in the contest despite injuring and temporally blinding Toby. In the series finale, while dancing with Pam, Toby began sobbing. Pam questions Toby with \"Is it me? Is it Nellie?\" Toby shakes his head, and responds with \"It's everything.\" Pam then hugs Toby as he weeps.\n\n===Jim===\nJim mentions that when he first started working at Dunder Mifflin, he shared a cubicle with Toby and that the two of them got along well. Michael moved them apart because he thought that the two talked too much. In deleted scenes from [[The Fire (The Office)|The Fire]] and [[Take Your Daughter to Work Day (The Office)|Take Your Daughter to Work Day]] it's implied that Toby and Jim are friends and Jim babysits Toby's daughter on occasion. When Jim becomes Co-Regional Manager with Michael in season six, however, Jim almost begins to mirror Michael's treatment of Toby somewhat. In \"[[The Lover (The Office)|The Lover]]\", when Toby casually says \"Hey Jim,\" a stressed Jim snaps \"Not now Toby! My God!\" leaving Toby bewildered and hurt (Jim however had just been angered upon learning that Michael is dating Pam's mother behind their backs). In the earlier \"[[Survivor Man]]\", after Toby demands that he get a birthday party that Michael previously took away from him and a cake, a frustrated Jim says about Toby \"He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much\", showing that he sees Toby as being annoying sometimes, which is further proven in the episode \"Dwight Christmas\" in which he and Darryl immediately leave the kitchen when Toby starts talking about his work on the Scranton Strangler case (implying Toby never stops talking about it). Jim was aware of Toby's crush on Pam but never seemed very bothered by it, aside from the episode \"Night Out\" in which he is shown to be shocked when Toby awkwardly touches Pam's leg. However, Jim has shown disgust at Michael's treatment of Toby on occasion.\n\nHowever, Toby would occasionally be bitter towards Jim, as seen in \"[[Did I Stutter?]]\" where he assists Ryan (now vice president of Dunder Mifflin) in giving Jim a formal warning for his job performance and criticizes him very bitterly in \"Branch Wars\" when Pam reluctantly allows Jim to join the Finer Things Club, though this likely all stems from Toby's jealousy of Jim's relationship with Pam. During \"[[Stairmageddon]]\", Jim turns to Toby for advice on marriage counseling due to Toby's past of going to such counseling. Jim is left thoughtful and concerned when Toby notes that Pam is in a very difficult situation of short-term vs. long-term issues with Jim's work at Athlead. Despite the moments mentioned above, Jim and Toby have a decent relationship.\n\n===Kelly and Ryan===\nToby shares the Annex with Kelly, and he is exasperated at being in the close proximity of Kelly and Ryan's juvenile romantic escapades. Using the excuse that he was allergic to his desk, Toby moved locations to escape [[Kelly Kapoor|Kelly's]] constant talking, moving out of the cubicle, albeit only to a desk adjacent to it. Toby later wonders if Michael intentionally moved Ryan to his former area in order to torture him via Ryan and Kelly's endless fighting, commenting that \"If he did... genius.\" Kelly stated in a deleted scene from [[Goodbye, Toby]] that she was attracted to Toby but could not stand \"his stupid kid\" and was visibly downcast when he announced his plans to leave the office and move to Costa Rica. Toby overall has a good relationship with both Kelly and Ryan and the two have never mistreated him in any way and once even attempted to encourage him to punch Michael in \"Frame Toby\", possibly showing that they are disgusted at Michael's harsh treatment of Toby.\n\n===Darryl===\nIn a deleted scene from \"[[Ben Franklin (The Office episode)|Ben Franklin]]\", when warehouse foreman [[Darryl Philbin]] is told that Michael has sent Toby home to prevent him from interfering with the hiring of a stripper, Darryl refers to Toby (\"that red-haired guy with the sad eyes\") as a cool guy. While on a trip to the Corporate offices with Darryl and Michael in \"[[The Negotiation]]\", Darryl also offers to let Toby crash for the night at a relative's house in New York, denying Michael the same opportunity. He also had a nickname for Toby (\"T-dog\") at one point, though their relationship soured when Dwight's plan to expose Darryl's worker's compensation fraud led to embarrassment for all of them and Toby insulted Darryl and his sister. Despite this, the two seem to have a good relationship and Darryl once gave Toby his Christmas doll to give to his daughter Sasha, after Toby paid him $400, which was double the price that Dwight sold them at.\n\n===Andy===\nToby and Andy did not appear to have any major disputes when Andy was a salesman (aside from the episode \"Casual Friday\") or during his first year as manager and seemed to have a good relationship.  In \"[[New Guys]]\", when Toby shoots down Andy's unethical idea to make up a cause to fire [[Nellie Bertram]], Andy responds \"now I know why Michael hated you so much\", Toby appeared dismayed at this.  Andy later ridiculed both Toby and Nellie during the slacklining later in the episode.  Andy continued his irritability in \"[[Work Bus]]\" when asking Toby \"how are you not murdered every hour\", suggesting he, like Michael and Jim before him, has inherited the typical manager's disdain for Toby. Andy was occasionally nasty to Toby on a few other occasions as well and even groped Toby before quitting Dunder Mifflin.\n\nToby appeared aware of Andy's poor treatment of Erin as a girlfriend, which he pointed out to Nellie in \"[[Customer Loyalty (The Office)|Customer Loyalty]]\". In the finale, however, after Andy returns with a more positive and friendly attitude, Toby is pleased to hear him (and several other staff members) encourage him to join them at the after party in the warehouse, implying the two are now on good terms.\n\n===Dwight===\nToby and Dwight appear to have a stable relationship and Dwight does not appear to hate Toby like Michael does, though on a few occasions Dwight has helped Michael make Toby miserable such as trying to get him arrested and fired once he returned from his vacation from Costa Rica (even more enthusiastically and intently than Michael) and stealing a Christmas present from him on Michael's orders and attempting to sabotage him in \"Fun Run\". Dwight also made no attempt to help Toby when he was selling Christmas dolls and ran out just as Toby asked for one for his daughter. Dwight has also on a few occasions laughed at Michael's insults towards Toby but has also shown some displeasure when Michael takes it too far such as in \"Goodbye Toby\", where he himself admits that he thought Michael's idea to give Toby a rock as a goodbye present was over the line. It is likely that Dwight makes Toby miserable due to his loyalty to Michael, however even after Michael left Dwight would occasionally still mistreat Toby and insult him, once even calling him \"the most forgettable man in the known world\" and having Robert California's son pretend to fire him. The two have gotten along on a few occasions and it is revealed that Dwight complains to Toby all the time about Jim's pranks against him and once made a deal with him to sign a petition of his in exchange for cookies from Toby's daughter. Toby and Dwight also share an interest in trains during a conversation while spying on Darryl and Dwight says he is welcome anytime to come to his farm.\n\nToby has on occasion been stern with Dwight, notably in \"Casual Friday\", in which he threatened to write him up if he did not sit down and has foiled some of Dwight's dangerous schemes such as leaving weapons in the office and stopping Dwight from wearing dangerous costumes to Halloween (for which Dwight threatens to kill him). In the final episode of the series, Dwight fires Toby alongside Kevin (though less harshly), possibly indicating that he dislikes Toby and that he annoys him to a degree, like his predecessors Michael, Jim, and Andy (or possibly on orders from Corporate or to prevent him from interfering in his firing of Kevin). While Dwight states that he misses Kevin after firing him, he never states the same for Toby. Dwight does, however, invite him to his wedding, possibly showing that he does consider him a friend.\n\n===Nellie===\nIn \"[[Get the Girl]]\"<ref>[[Get the Girl]]</ref> Toby introduces himself to Nellie as Tony, to which Pam replies \"You messed up saying your name?\" He answers her by saying, \"It happens, okay?\"\n\nIn \"[[Dwight Christmas]]\", at the office Christmas party, Nellie expressed interest upon hearing that Toby had been a juror in the Scranton Strangler case.  He proceeds to bore her, however, with a long, drawn-out account that is implied to have lasted for several hours.  Nellie finally leans in close and shushes him.  A puzzled Toby then asks if she is about to kiss him.  Attempting to save face, Nellie gives him a small kiss, which causes an emboldened Toby to give her a much more passionate kiss.\n\nToby does not appear in the two subsequent episodes, during which the events of the party are not referenced.  In \"[[Customer Loyalty (The Office)|Customer Loyalty]]\", however, he appears very tactile and affectionate towards Nellie, apparently under the impression that the two are now in a relationship.  Nellie, for her part, had forgotten the kiss until that point and finds Toby's affection somewhat awkward.\n\nIn \"[[Moving On (The Office)|Moving On]]\", Nellie gets fed up with Toby's constant hand-wringing over the possible non-guilt of the convicted Scranton Strangler and pushes him to visit the man in prison; when the Strangler proves he is the killer and nearly kills Toby himself, Nellie admits Toby was brave and a speechless Toby (his larynx was injured by the Strangler) looks happy. However, Nellie later firmly establishes her contempt for Toby and there is no further romantic story-line between them. She is also somewhat rude and insulting to him on a few occasions notably in \"Paper Airplane\" in which she speaks of him as being a loser, however, Nellie's poor treatment of him could stem from Toby's awkward and annoying behaviour towards her.\n\nWhen Toby returns to Scranton for the reunion and Angela and Dwight's wedding, Nellie (also returning to Scranton from her new home in Poland) lets the camera crew know she is not thrilled about seeing Toby again. At the airport, Nellie rebuffs an attempted hug from Toby, snidely brushes aside his comment about a relationship she ended by saying she un-followed him on Facebook and questions him of how long he has been stalking her (Toby quietly says anyone can read non-protected tweets) and declines his offer to share a cab into town. After that point, Toby has no further interactions of any kind with Nellie.\n\n===Pete and Clark===\nAfter the departure of Kelly and Ryan, Toby appears more excited with the arrival of the two twenty-somethings who are single like himself.  He appears to see them as closer friends than they see him but neither of them treats him meanly either.  He convinced both of them, along with Kevin and Darryl, to grow moustaches from \"[[Movember]]\", believing this was a bonding activity.  He was disappointed when Pete shaved his moustache off after Erin found it off-putting.\n\nToby appears to consider Pete a better fit for Erin than Andy, largely because he does not appreciate Andy's belittling treatment of him and also because he never had any romantic interest in Erin. At the documentary reunion, Pete is nice to Toby and is visibly happy when Toby decides to attend an after-party he had been planning to skip.\n\n==Seasons 1\u20132==\n\nToby only appears in a few episodes, showing up first in a scene in \"[[Diversity Day (The Office)|Diversity Day]]\", in which he jokes about sitting in an Indian Circle (to which everyone else laughs). Michael, having told many more offensive jokes, is offended by Toby's joke and tells him that \"This is an environment of welcoming, and you should just get the hell out of here.\" Toby does so and the staff suddenly goes very quiet. This is the first instance in the relationship between the two, Toby trying to be responsible, and Michael trying to demean and undermine him as much as possible. In \"[[Hot Girl (The Office)|Hot Girl]]\", Toby is introduced by Michael to Katy the purse saleswoman; after Toby and Katy begin talking happily about their high school days, Michael deliberately humiliates Toby by mentioning his divorce and how he once briefly had to live in his car. He also notices the picture of Toby's daughter on his desk, and refers to her as \"cute\"; however, this is probably a further attempt to portray Toby, a divorced father, as undesirable.<ref>Season 1</ref>\n\nOne of Toby's major appearances was in \"[[Sexual Harassment (The Office episode)|Sexual Harassment]]\", where he holds a Sexual Harassment Meeting for the staff, only to be interrupted by Michael and a blow-up doll. Michael then states that everyone is still \"generally quite happy\", which he thinks is because Toby has not yet had the meeting. In fact, Toby did have the meeting and everyone clapped after he was done, leaving them in a good mood.\n\nIn a deleted scene of \"[[Halloween (The Office episode)|Halloween]]\", Toby tries to persuade Michael to make a decision as to which employee he must fire. When Michael chooses Toby, Toby replies that he does not report to Michael. When Michael then tries to get Toby to quit, Toby replies that someone else will just take his place. Michael then claims that if he had the authority, he would immediately fire Toby, to which Toby calmly replies, \"I know, Michael.\"\n\nIn \"[[Booze Cruise (The Office episode)|Booze Cruise]]\", Toby is late arriving at the dock for a company cruise. When Michael orders the ship to leave without him, Toby grins broadly, implying he had planned things in order to miss the event.\n\nIn \"[[Take Your Daughter to Work Day (The Office episode)|Take Your Daughter to Work Day]]\", Toby's daughter, Sasha, distracts Michael; the two actually get along, showing Michael's friendly side. Toby and Michael have a good conversation about Michael's desire to have a family: Michael wants to have a biological child, and Toby hints that he should seek out alternatives. When Michael asks if Sasha already has a godfather, Toby quickly replies, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"[[Conflict Resolution (The Office episode)|Conflict Resolution]]\" is Toby's biggest role in the season. Toby shows that he handles inter-office complaints calmly and efficiently, only to see his work undone by Michael's stupidity. When Dwight threatens to quit unless Michael fires Jim (because of Jim's history of pranks against Dwight), Michael attempts to resolve the conflict by making vague promises of future action, an approach similar to one Toby had used successfully in the past. Toby covertly shows that he files Dwight's complaints against Jim in a trash box and that he puts the huge number of complaints against Michael in unmarked boxes that are filed into the vast space of the warehouse.\n\nIn \"[[Casino Night (The Office episode)|Casino Night]]\", Toby tries to convince Michael not to invite Boy Scouts to a company Casino Night. Michael's response is to demean him in front of everybody. Toby just lets him finish. That night, however, Toby viciously beats Michael at no-limit Texas Hold 'Em, to Michael's visible irritation. Later, Toby says to the camera, \"I'm not gonna lie\u2014it felt good to take money from Michael. I'm gonna chase that feeling.\"<ref>Season 2</ref>\n\n==Seasons 3\u20134==\nIn \"[[The Convention (The Office episode)|The Convention]]\", after finding out that Pam is no longer engaged, Toby makes a couple of attempts to ask her out but can't say the words. Michael trashes Toby to Jim and eagerly asks Jim if the HR rep is the reason he left for Stamford. Michael is visibly stung when Jim says no (he later tells Michael about his declaration of love for Pam).\n\nIn \"[[The Convict]]\", Michael jokingly refers to Toby as a rapist, much to the dismay of those present. Later, Toby convinces Michael to release the office employees from the conference room, whom he had locked in there as punishment for unfavorably comparing Dunder Mifflin to a prison.\n\nIn \"[[A Benihana Christmas]]\", Michael has Dwight take Toby's gift bag present of an expensive robe when they run out of enough of them for everyone. Pam later comes over and kindly gives her robe to Toby.\n\nIn \"[[Back from Vacation]]\", Toby asks Michael about the \"Jamaica Jan Sun Princess\" photo. Michael tries to accuse Toby of stealing the file from him, but Toby says \"nine different people sent it to me, including my ex-wife, and, well, we don't talk.\" Michael then insults Toby's divorce again and calls him a perv, but does state for the record that he and Jan do not have a relationship.\n\nIn \"[[Phyllis' Wedding]]\", Toby is seen with a beautiful woman whom he says he met in the gym, although Kevin believes she is a paid escort.  When Phyllis tosses her bouquet, it is Toby's date that catches it, and then excitedly runs back to Toby and the two share a brief embrace and kiss. Toby is then shown in a talking head as very ecstatic towards the outcome. It is implied that Toby and his date eventually broke up afterwards as this is the only episode where she is seen.\n\nIn \"[[Business School (The Office episode)|Business School]]\", he tells Pam he cannot make it to her art show because his daughter has a play. He then offers to miss his daughter's play because \"what they do is not art.\"\n\nIn \"[[Cocktails (The Office episode)|Cocktails]]\", Toby spends the whole evening trying to win Pam a duck from a claw machine after she comments on how cute it is. When he finally wins it, Pam suggests that he give it to his daughter instead.\n\nIn \"[[The Negotiation]]\", Toby is forced to listen to Ryan and Kelly bickering nonstop when Michael moves Ryan back to the annex. Toby wonders if Michael did this to punish Toby and that if he did, it was a genius move. Toby goes with Michael and Darryl to New York after Jan says she will not do the contract negotiation unless Toby is there. When Michael repeatedly mentions his and Jan's relationship at that point, Toby takes notes and Michael insults him, but Toby just says he has \"preparing for the deposition\" that he thinks will inevitably occur because Michael threatened to withhold sex from a female superior in order to get a modest, scheduled raise, commenting, \"It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.\" Additionally, when Darryl says he will stay in New York for the night, he tells Toby he can join him and stay at his relative's house, pointedly not extending the same offer to Michael.\n\nIn \"[[Women's Appreciation]]\", Toby is out of the office at a parent-teacher conference when Phyllis is flashed. When he returns, Michael scoffs at his alibi and seriously asks to see his penis to rule him out as a suspect. Toby turns towards Michael and looks like he has about to get angry; Michael then seems to catch himself and admits what he said to Toby was wrong.\n\nIn \"[[Beach Games]]\", Michael bans Toby from attending the beach event because he wants it to be fun and says it will not be if Toby is there. Toby is visibly upset that he will not get to see Pam in a bikini (which she ends up not wearing there) and is seen despondently doing paper work in a deleted scene from the episode.<ref>Season 3</ref>\n\nOn the Season 3 DVD, Toby gives a series of wraparound interviews. Among other things:\n*He lists the various insulting nicknames Michael has for him, including \"The Devil's Butthole\" and \"Gargamel\", noting \"I prefer Toby\".\n*He describes Michael's \"invention\" of a safe George Foreman Grill after he burned his foot, which involved putting the Grill inside a bunny cage.\n*He says that his job is not a nightmare because you wake up from nightmares; it's more like an unrelenting \"daymare\".\n*He lists what he would do if he had one day to live, including wanting to \"Burn this place (The Office) to the ground\" this makes the interviewer react with horror and/or disbelief which Toby responds to with a confused \"What?\".\n*He says, \"HR isn't just a job, it's a way of life. (Pause) But I wish it was just a job.\"<ref>Season 3 DVD</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Fun Run]]\", Toby goes against [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael's]] theory of an office curse by mentioning he won a drawing at a local pizza place, but Michael insults him and later ignores his statement that you cannot ask employees about their religions. Before the race, Dwight puts [[Imodium]] in Toby's drink instead of Ex-Lax and Michael pulls Toby's shorts down right before the starting gun is fired. Toby later wins the race to cure rabies, beating Michael and accomplishing something noteworthy; however, no one notices his win, and Kelly does not even bother looking up when he crosses the finish line. Toby then wonders why the 5K course was a straight line instead of a circle that would have returned everyone to the Dunder Mifflin building.\n\nIn \"[[Dunder Mifflin Infinity]]\", after seeing Pam kiss Jim, Toby sends out a memo about public displays of affection. When Michael accosts Toby about the memo (thinking it's about him and Jan having sex in the office), Toby tells him, in front of everyone, that it is about Jim and Pam. When they confirm that they are dating everyone is happy, except Toby. Later Pam and Jim visit him to see if they have to sign a \"Love Contract\", but he tells them to wait and see. In a scene that was added to the episode's repeat airing on NBC, Toby comes into work with a woman he says is his girlfriend and makes out with her right in front of the reception desk and Pam.\n\nIn \"[[Money (The Office)|Money]]\", Toby shows that he uses very good grammar when he corrects Michael and clears up a confusion between the usages of the words \"whoever\" and \"whomever\" (\"who\" is used as a [[subject (grammar)|subject]], while \"whom\" is used as an [[object (grammar)|object]]). Michael responds by telling Toby to shove a letter opener in his skull.\n\nIn a deleted scene of \"[[Local Ad]]\", Toby pitches an idea of having a stop motion ad that Michael, of course, puts down although the rest of the office seems to like the idea. When the local ad is being played at the bar, Toby is in the ad, but only briefly. While Michael was shooting the scene of the paper airplane flying out of the hand of Creed towards the conference room window, you see Toby in the conference room packing up whatever work he was finishing. Michael did not want Toby in the video; however, for a fleeting moment, Toby had managed to unintentionally get a part in the ad.\n\nToby's distaste for Pam's relationship with Jim is again brought up in \"[[Branch Wars]]\" when Jim is allowed to join \"The Finer Things Club\", an exclusive organization built up by Pam, Toby, and Oscar, dedicated to discussing civilized culture. During the episode's final scene, after Jim contributes his ideas on the book being discussed, Toby scrutinizes him very bitterly, hinting again at his disdain for Jim's success with Pam. His irritation is attributed to the fact that Jim did not read the book, though Oscar and even Pam are also annoyed with Jim's wisecracking, uninformed behavior. Also in this episode Michael tells Karen she can have Toby instead of Stanley; when Karen says Toby is not a salesperson, Michael briefly tries to talk up Toby's ability to learn before saying he cannot fake it and insulting the HR rep anew.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Survivor Man]]\", Toby ends up getting on Jim's nerves. When Jim is named Acting Manager while Michael is off on his \"wilderness adventure\" and starts altering the office's birthday schedule, Toby asks Jim if he can have a birthday celebration, explaining that Michael deliberately held a party for Toby at 4:58 PM on a Friday so no one would attend. Jim agrees but comments that he likes Toby but that the guy is really annoying him, claiming that sometimes Toby can sometimes be a little bit much. Jim's dismissive, disgusted attitude toward Toby (whom he has always gotten along with before) very closely mirrors how Michael treats Toby. It is not clear whether Jim is genuinely fed up with Toby or whether this interplay showed that Jim was beginning to act like Michael. It is also possible that Jim was not annoyed at Toby specifically but at the general reaction to his plan. Jim's disgusted attitude can also be attributed to the fact that Toby has been treating Jim fairly poorly in previous episodes due to his jealousy of his relationship with Pam.\n\nMichael's hatred for Toby is brought up again in \"[[The Deposition (The Office episode)|The Deposition]]\" when Michael says he does not want Toby in the deposition and nastily asks if the HR rep is there \"to renew your divorce vows\" (Toby is also sitting a conspicuous distance from Michael in the uncrowded room being used for the proceedings). When the two happen to sit next to each other at lunch, Toby kindly tells Michael that he can relate to Michael's situation, of Toby's parents' divorce. While Toby is talking, Michael pushes Toby's lunch tray on the floor, then gets up and leaves. Later in the episode, Toby begins to laugh at Michael after learning Michael thinks Ryan is \"hot.\" Also, after Jan's attorney brings out Michael's diary, and the head of the deposition says \"Okay, we'll need ten copies of that diary\", to which Toby says, \"Make that eleven.\" In a deleted scene, Michael asks Toby if he will tell Meredith that the car accident from [[Fun Run]] was Michael's fault, and Toby nods.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Night Out (The Office episode)|Night Out]]\", he puts his hand on Pam's leg and caresses it for a long, awkward moment, which everyone standing around seems to notice, making this the first time the employees see Toby's possible crush on Pam. Immediately thereafter, realizing what he had just done, he abruptly announces that he is moving to [[Costa Rica]], runs outside to the security fence, scales it, and disappears into the night. This scene was done by a stunt double, as Lieberstein wanted to do it himself but it was decided for insurance reasons to let the stuntman do his work.\n\nIn \"[[Did I Stutter?]]\", Toby and Ryan together (who both have a problem with Jim; Toby dislikes him for dating Pam and Ryan dislikes him for going over his head) warn Jim on his job performance, citing specifically his indifference toward his job and use of time (namely \"goofing off with Dwight\" and \"time spent at Reception\" with Pam). Toby then says to the camera that Jim's time spent with Pam \"has finally caught up to him\", but he repeats Pam's name several times when unnecessary. Toby later says, though, that he agrees that Jim has good numbers but Ryan thinks they are not good enough. In the same episode, Toby convinces Michael he needs to deal with [[Stanley Hudson|Stanley]] for his open [[insubordination]] during a staff meeting, though Michael goes about it a different way because Toby's method \"did not work because it was stupid.\" Michael also says Toby does not have any friends, but Michael does so in the context of stating that Stanley is Michael's friend, which is later shown to be completely inaccurate as Stanley despises him for his stupidity and is not afraid to confront Michael about it. It is also shown that Dwight thinks Toby may be [[Jewish]], as Dwight's org chart shows a blue [[Star of David]] with a question mark next to Toby's name; Toby did not say what (if any) religion he practiced when Michael prodded the staffers to talk about their religious practices in [[Fun Run]]. As Toby spent time in a seminary (as revealed in season five episode \"[[Casual Friday (The Office)|Casual Friday]]\") he is most likely a Roman Catholic.\n\nIn \"[[Goodbye, Toby]]\", he follows through on his earlier plans and quits his job as HR representative to move to Costa Rica. Michael is overjoyed at his departure and plans to throw a lavish goodbye party that reflects this. Both Kelly and Pam say they are sorry he is leaving, with Pam saying in an interview that she thinks he is kind of cute. Toby also ends up annoying Holly, his replacement, to a degree while showing her around the office and she is somewhat rude to him and claims that he almost bored her to sleep, something which Michael enjoys hearing (Holly remains oblivious that Michael, in fact, abuses Toby and Michael claims that Toby tortures him, though it is possible she only puts Toby down so as to get on Michael's good side). Toby faces a cruel exit interview from Michael but the tables are turned when Holly and Pam join the interview. Michael is unable to berate Toby at length as Holly takes over. When Toby is asked; \"What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?\", Toby claims he has a few ideas. Realizing that Toby has a potential opportunity to reveal and complain about his unethical work behavior and abusive treatment, Michael hides his face and angrily glares at Toby and silently threatens to kill him if he answers the question. Toby does not seem afraid but simply gives a \"things are OK as they are\" answer. Toby later tells the camera that he has made it far enough without disclosing Michael's behavior and that there is no point in doing so.\n\nToby gets revenge when Michael's insulting farewell gift to him is exposed (a rock with a note reading: \"Suck on this!\") and Pam gets Michael to unwillingly give up his watch to Toby, which he does, clearly upset. Toby's main concern on his last day is getting pictures of himself alone with Pam, which he finally does as his party is ending. Michael gets a last dig in by having Hank the security guard escort Toby out of the office as he leaves for his new life in Costa Rica and is still shown to be upset when Toby looks at his new watch. In a deleted scene at his farewell party, Toby refers to an undefined incident involving his sister; this marks the first time Toby has mentioned having any siblings, although late in season 7 he reveals also having a brother Rory.<ref>Season 4</ref>\n\n==Seasons 5\u20136==\n\nIn season five, Toby is revealed to be in traction in a Costa Rican hospital, with a broken neck, after a [[zip-line]] accident on his third day in Costa Rica. He explains that he has yet to see the beach, but expresses some happiness with the camera crew for visiting. He also implies in an earlier talk with Oscar that he is attracted to a woman who is visiting a nearby resort with her husband, thus continuing his tendency to fall for unavailable women \u00e0 la Pam. In a deleted scene from [[Baby Shower (The Office)|Baby Shower]], Toby can be heard on the speakerphone with [[Holly Flax|Holly]], noting that he enjoys his stay at the hospital more than his treatment from Michael at the office.\n\nIn \"[[Frame Toby]]\", it is revealed that Toby had returned to the office for a week without Michael noticing. When the staff tells Michael that Toby is back, Michael thinks it's a joke until he sees Toby and screams \"No God! Please No! No!\" Michael asks David Wallace to get rid of Toby but the CFO says he can not fire Toby without cause. Michael then attempts to get Toby fired by giving Pam a fake letter to give to Toby, asking him to hug and kiss her no matter how much she resisted, and taunting the HR rep into punching him, but both plans fail. Michael then tries out Dwight's idea of planting drugs in Toby's desk (unknowingly buying [[basil]] from a [[caprese salad]] from warehouse workers who he thinks sold him [[marijuana]]). However, he does feel guilty about what he has done and, when the police are investigating the \"drugs\", Michael tells the police that it's a mistake and tries to stop them from arresting Toby. This suggests that, while Michael does hate Toby, there are limits to his hatred. Then again, Toby's reaction to the setup\u2014that it wasted the cops' time that could have been used to deal with law enforcement\u2014inspires more shock and disgust from Michael.\n\nHe is seen on occasion in the background in the \"Annex\" of the office. When Michael gives his two weeks notice, Toby shows he is not as resentful towards Michael as Michael is to him in a talking head, referring to him as a movie on an airplane, which is nothing special but something to watch. He was seen breaking up a jam session in the lunch room up between Dwight and Andy who were attempting to impress the new receptionist with guitar and banjo to the song \"[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]\" by [[John Denver]]. Toby simply says, \"You have to stop.\"\n\nIn \"[[Stress Relief (The Office)|Stress Relief]]\", Toby is seen attempting to help the others escape Dwight's fire drill. In the second part of the episode, during the roasting of Michael, Toby begins to walk to the mike but Michael stops him declaring that only friends are allowed to roast him and Toby agrees and sits back down and laughs with the rest of the audience at Michael being roasted. It is possible Michael stopped Toby from roasting him not only because they are not friends but because Toby would have the worst things to say about him.\n\nHe is also involved in the episode \"[[Casual Friday (The Office)|Casual Friday]]\" where he has a talking head about his beginnings at Dunder Mifflin. He used to be in seminary, but he left because he wanted to have sex with a girl named Kathy and took the HR job at Dunder Mifflin so he could be with her. Kathy is revealed to be the name of his ex-wife, and he does not appear to have a passion for HR. In the same episode, he has to deal with complaints about a too relaxed dress code by Oscar and Meredith. For the first time, he is stern with his employees and enforces HR policy by cancelling Casual Fridays at the office.<ref>Season 5</ref>\n\nIn the episode \"[[Gossip (The Office)|Gossip]]\", Michael spreads rumors about various people throughout the Office, including that Toby is a virgin, even though he has a daughter.\n\nIn the episode \"[[The Meeting (The Office)|The Meeting]]\", Dwight and Toby investigate a dishonest workman's compensation claim filed by Darryl, an event which results in Dwight and Darryl filing complaints against each other, leaving Toby to \"drown in a sea of paperwork.\" During the episode, Toby ends up bonding with Dwight when they share an interest in trains, and finds that Dwight is restoring a life size one in his slaughterhouse.\n\nAlthough he does not appear, directly, in the episode [[The Promotion (The Office)|The Promotion]], Michael and Jim put baked beans on pictures of the employees as a way to decide the raises. Jim then sees a drawn picture of what looks to be a clown with a caption saying \"I'm an idiot\" and asks Michael who it is, Michael answers, saying it is Toby. Jim reminds Michael that Toby is not part of this and Michael answers \"I just wanted to draw a picture of him\".\n\nIn the episode \"[[Niagara (The Office)|Niagara]]\", Toby kindly offers Michael the second bed he has in his room but Michael insults him by telling him he will be sleeping alone for the rest of his life and walks away. Toby seems to at least have some feelings left for Pam, as he seems to be happy when reacting to a possibility of Jim and Pam's wedding being called off. When the wedding does go on, however, he is seen dancing with the others and cheering Jim and Pam on as they walk down the aisle at the ceremony's end.\n\nIn the following episode, \"[[Mafia (The Office)|Mafia]]\", Oscar comments that with Jim and Pam off on their honeymoon and Toby having \"mentally checked out in June\" he is the only person left to counter insane antics with rational thinking. When hearing of Oscar's comments Toby casually agrees with him.<ref>Season 6</ref>\n\nIn the episode \"[[The Lover (The Office)|The Lover]]\",  Toby is yelled at by both Michael and Jim when he walks in on them just after Michael has told Jim he is dating Pam's mom. Later, after Pam blew up at Michael in the conference during an office meeting, Michael comes to Toby desperate to make Pam happy about his relationship with her mother. Toby offers to talk to Pam for Michael and Michael even goes as far as hugging Toby and calls him a good good-guy. Toby is extremely happy at the hope that things will finally change between them that he says \"you know I always knew that if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we would be friends.\" But once Toby is unable to smooth things over, Michael dismisses Toby as a jackass and goes right back to hating him.\n\nIn the episode \"Koi Pond\", Toby is present in the meeting where Michael wants to talk about insults in the office and as usual when Toby simply makes a point Michael insults him by calling him a waste of life, though corrects himself claiming that's what he would like to say but the meeting is an insult free zone. However, when Michael reveals he has fallen into two fountains Toby appears to find this funny and laughs at Michael. After this, he asks for Michael to kick him out of the meeting and Michael tells him to go.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Double Date (The Office)|Double Date]]\", Toby talks to Pam to make sure she plans on hitting Michael off grounds. He then gives Pam some tips on how to punch harder, even going through motions with her on how to do it as Michael watches on from his office, visibly afraid.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Secret Santa (The Office)|Secret Santa]]\", Toby is called \"[[Antichrist]]\" for calling Michael's Jesus costume inappropriate. In \"[[The Banker (The Office)|The Banker]]\" Toby is interviewed by an investment banker as he evaluates the branch. Michael tries to have Toby distracted while Dwight impersonates him but Toby appears and makes Dwight leave. Despite knowing of several questionable incidents that have taken place in the office, he does not say anything to the banker. He expresses his torn feelings about this in a talking head.\n\nIn \"[[Whistleblower (The Office)|Whistleblower]]\", Toby is revealed to have written a few chapters of a mystery novel and receives advice on the plot from Jo Bennett to which he replies in an interview, \"Write your own damn novel!\"\n\n==Seasons 7\u20138==\nIn \"[[Nepotism (The Office)|Nepotism]]\", as a punishment for physically injuring an employee, Michael is sent to a 6-hour counselling with Toby. In a deleted scene, Toby tells the camera crew that he finished writing his book over the summer and got four sales out of his [[self-publishing]] but is being sued for plagiarism.\n\nIn \"[[Counseling (The Office)|Counseling]]\", Toby does counselling for Michael. They briefly become friends as Michael talks to Toby about his life, but when Michael realizes that Toby is, in fact, counselling him, Michael yells at him. Toby reveals that he has a degree in [[social work]]. At the end of the episode, however, he seems to be communicating with Toby civilly, as most of his anger is fixed on Gabe Lewis.\n\nIn \"[[Costume Contest]]\", Toby dresses up as a hobo. In a deleted scene, while using a [[Ouija board]] at the office Hallowe'en party, he mumbles that \"being dead is going to be ''so'' relaxing\", disturbing his co-workers.\n\nIn \"[[Christening (The Office)|Christening]]\", Toby has trouble entering the church where Jim and Pam's baby is being christened. After many false starts, he finally enters the chapel and can be seen in front of the altar asking \"Why do you have to be so mean to me?\"\n\nIn a deleted scene from \"[[WUPHF.com]]\", he is talking with his daughter via web chat, where he finds out through her that his ex-wife has a new boyfriend. Michael shuts off Toby's laptop and then proceeds to talk with him about the situation he is in with Ryan. Toby tries to offer the best advice he can, but as usual, Michael brushes off what he says and then pokes fun at the fact that someone else is banging his wife.\n\nIn \"[[Classy Christmas]]\" Toby has to go on leave so he can report for jury duty. The case turns out to be that of the Scranton Strangler, a fact Toby lets slip out despite his not supposed to be talking about the case. He later says to the camera crew he likes the attention. Michael is visibly disgusted when Toby returns on jury recess to attend the Christmas party and tells the staff to not ask Toby any questions as he will not leave and this will prevent Holly from returning. In the second part of the episode, Michael attempts to frame Toby for vandalizing Holly's beloved Woody Doll but Toby immediately denies it and flips it around on Michael claiming the vandalism is something he would do, to which everyone agrees to eventually.\n\nToby has a minor role in Michael Scott's film \"[[Threat Level Midnight]]\" as a hostage. When the villain Goldenface (played by Jim), decides to show the hero (played by Michael Scott) how serious he is, he decides to kill a hostage, naturally picking Toby. When Goldface shoots Toby's character, his head explodes in an overly dramatic fashion. However, Michael tells Goldenface that the joke is on him, saying that Toby was a \"wanted animal rapist\".\n\nToby returns in \"[[Michael's Last Dundies]]\", where he appears to have lost a considerable amount of weight. In the beginning of the episode, Michael eggs his house in the morning and drives away. Toby is later seen at the Dundies sitting with Jim and Pam. Michael awards Toby with the \"Extreme Repulsiveness\" award (with Deangelo commenting how mean that is). Toby refuses to accept it but is told he has to by the other employees because Michael is leaving. Toby then reluctantly accepts it, but tells Michael he finds the award hateful. He then goes on to say that he is taking advantage of being up on the platform, and lets everyone know that the jury found The Scranton Strangler guilty and that he is being put to death. However, Toby is now having doubts about the verdict, saying he thinks the Strangler might be innocent, but is interrupted by an \"[[Oh Yeah (Yello song)|Oh Yeah]]\" sound effect from Dwight's [[synthesizer]].\n\nIn \"[[Goodbye, Michael]]\", Michael is seen saying goodbye to Toby without insulting him, possibly indicating that he will miss Toby on some level. However, Michael is visibly disgusted when he learns that Toby has a brother, Rory (played by Paul Lieberstein's real-life brother Warren), who lives in [[Boulder, Colorado]] as well. Later, Toby is seen talking to Rory via Skype and tells him he thinks his brother and Michael would \"hit it off in an odd way\". Rory suggests that he could bring Michael a welcome basket, and asks Toby if Michael likes Jams, but Toby informs him that Michael hates them.\n\nIn the beginning of \"[[The Inner Circle (The Office)|The Inner Circle]]\", Deangelo informs Toby that he is getting a new chair, but Deangelo, trying to be confusing so the staff will not \"figure him out\", tells Toby he does not care if he likes it. Toby is still grateful.\n\nIn \"[[Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager]]\", he gets to fill out the gun violence accident form, much to his excitement. After Jo demotes Dwight upon learning of his gun accident, she appoints Toby as one of the search committee members who would be in charge of interviewing candidates for the manager position (along with Jim and Gabe).\n\nIn \"[[The List (The Office)|The List]]\", new CEO [[Robert California]] makes a list of the people in the office, dividing them between perceived \"winners\" and \"losers\"; he takes the winners out to lunch. Although Toby is on the list of \"winners\", he concludes that it must be a mistake, and excuses himself in the middle of lunch.\n\nIn \"[[Lotto (The Office)|Lotto]]\", Toby says in a talking-head interview that if he won the lottery, he would not change his life at all, except for quitting his job, moving away, and maybe re-entering the dating world.<ref>http://www.nbc.com/the-office/video/wondering-about-a-windfall/1361025?auto=true</ref> He also says he would spend a lot of time launching his true-crime podcast, \"The Flenderson Files\".\n\nIn \"[[Garden Party (The Office)|Garden Party]]\", Toby arrives at \"Schrute Farms\" and asks Dwight's cousin, Mose, where to park. Mose states that he is the valet and that Toby has to give him his car. Reluctantly, and after much pressure, Toby lets Mose park his car. It proves to be a bad choice, however, as Mose drives his car straight into a cornfield (though it is not damaged, and becomes the first of many cars parked there in odd, Mose-chosen order).\n\nIn \"[[Spooked (The Office)|Spooked]]\", Dwight and Robert California's son Bert hearken back to the days when Toby was continuously mistreated by Michael when they \"prank\" Toby by telling him he is fired. Toby finds Bert's treatment of him hurtful\u2014especially Bert saying he can have Toby fired because he is the CEO's kid\u2014and Dwight finds the whole bit hilarious.\n\nIn \"[[Test the Store]]\", Toby has a rare substantial role in a Season 8 episode, where he leads a self-defense lecture for the employees after they believe Andy was attacked by a gang and left with a black eye (Toby and everyone else later find out Andy was punched by a rude 4th-grade girl when he defended Pam from a barrage of tossed pine cones). When Toby is not aggressive enough for Kelly Kapoor's taste, she stands up and begins threatening and swinging at him, after which Andy defends Toby and gets punched in his other eye.\n\n==Season 9==\n\nIn \"[[New Guys]]\", Andy returns from [[Outward Bound]] manager training, making him become more \"decisive and confident\". When Andy tells Toby that he plans to fabricate an excuse to fire Nellie, Toby shoots down the idea as a violation of corporate policy, prompting Andy to tell Toby \"I understand why Michael didn't like you.\" When Andy hosts a motivational exercise involving a tightrope, he insults Toby and Nellie in front of the staff. Since that time, Andy has been rude towards Toby in a manner that echoes Michael Scott's hatred of his harmless HR rep, though Toby seems much less affected by Andy's behavior than he was by Michael's. When Andy went off on his long boat trip, Toby's time in the last season was devoted to his unrequited romantic interest in [[Nellie Bertram]] and his belief that he'd convicted an innocent man during his jury time on the Scranton Strangler case (a theory he put to rest when he went to visit the convict in prison and was, in fact, choked and nearly strangled by him). In the series finale, it's revealed that Toby was fired immediately after Dwight fired Kevin Malone (it's likely that the Corporate office fired Toby and Dwight simply had the burden of telling him) and Toby then moved to New York where he is trying to become a novelist and has six roommates. Toby surprises his former co-workers at the reunion panel when he says that his life feels meaningless now that he is not being filmed for the documentary anymore. He breaks down in tears while dancing with Pam at Dwight and Angela's wedding, saying of what's bad in his life that \"It's everything!\", but he seems cheered a little when the group insists he join them for post-wedding festivities. In a photo gallery NBC released of \"where are they now?\" info-bits for the characters, it's revealed that Toby has returned to his destiny by taking on an HR position at a [[TJ Maxx]] store.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{The Office US}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flenderson, Toby}}\n[[Category:The Office (American TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2005]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Indiana]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fictional character on The Office (US)}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{primary sources|date=April 2010}}\n{{in-universe|date=April 2010}}\n{{Overly detailed|date=June 2019}}\n}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Toby Flenderson\n| image              = Toby Flenderson promo picture.jpg\n| caption            = [[Paul Lieberstein]] as Toby Flenderson\n| first              = \"[[Diversity Day (The Office)|Diversity Day]]\"\n| last               = \"[[Finale (The Office)|Finale]]\"\n| creator            = [[Greg Daniels]]\n| portrayer          = [[Paul Lieberstein]]\n| occupation         = Human Resources Representative, Dunder Mifflin, Scranton\n| spouse             = Kathy Becker (ex-wife)\n| gender             = Male\n| family             = Rory (brother)\n| children           = Sasha Flenderson (daughter)\n| religion           = [[Roman Catholic]]\n| nationality        = [[United States|American]]\n| series             = \n| franchise          = \n| alt                = \n| full_name          = \n| origin             = \n| home               = \n| color              = #89cff0\n}}\n\n'''Toby H.

He is portrayed by [[Paul Lieberstein]], who was also the show's [[writer]], [[television director|director]], [[television producer|producer]] and [[showrunner]]. He is the human resources representative at the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] branch of the paper distribution company, [[Dunder Mifflin]]. Toby is an original character with no counterpart in [[The Office (British TV series)|the original British series]].\n\n==Overview==\nToby Flenderson is the [[human resources]] representative for the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] branch of paper distributor [[Dunder Mifflin]]/Sabre. Mild-mannered to the point of being physically incapable of voicing his opinions or asserting himself, Toby can be somewhat mournful about his life choices (he fell into the field of Human Resources after leaving his training at [[seminary]] in order to pursue the woman he would later marry and painfully divorce). He likes his colleagues, although he is sometimes exasperated by the excessively chatty [[Kelly Kapoor]]. He also has a long-standing crush on [[Pam Beesly]], which he almost reveals at the end of Season 4 when he resigns from his position to move to [[Costa Rica]]. Toby was intensely despised by branch manager [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]], largely because Michael had no authority over him as Toby reported to corporate headquarters, and because Toby frequently tried to dissuade Michael from many of his ill-conceived and impulsive ideas. Michael sums up his feelings for Toby in the episode \"[[Casino Night]]\", asking, \"Why are you the way that you are? Honestly every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be.\" For Toby's going away party in \"[[Goodbye Toby]]\", Michael gives him as a gift a rock with a note attached reading \"Suck on This!\" Shortly after arriving in Costa Rica, Toby suffers a [[zip-line]] accident and midway through season 5, he returns to his old job at Dunder Mifflin, much to Michael's fury.\n\n==Biography==\nIn his childhood, Toby was forced to testify against both of his parents when the two got divorced. He attended [[Bishop O'Hara High School]] and is a [[Penn State University]] alumnus. In the Season 5 episode \"[[Casual Friday (The Office)|Casual Friday]]\", a diploma at his cubicle reveals Toby also has a B.S. in psychology from California Coastal College. The Season 7 episode \"[[Counseling (The Office)|Counseling]]\" reveals he has a degree in [[social work]] from [[Temple University]]. Toby was in a seminary for a year but dropped out when he met his future wife. The two moved to Scranton and had a daughter named Sasha. They later [[divorce]]d. Toby loves his daughter and went the extra mile in \"[[Moroccan Christmas]]\" to buy her one of Dwight's Princess Unicorn dolls from [[Darryl Philbin]], noting that his ex-wife \"will be so pissed\" and that \"for once, Daddy's going to be a hero.\" However Darryl bought an African-American doll. When Darryl asks if the doll is okay, Toby says \"It's even better than the one I wanted.\" <!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TobyFlenderson.jpg|left|210px|thumb|Toby]] -->\n\nToby claims to have no \"passion for HR\" and was only hired at Dunder Mifflin as it was the first job he could find. He joins the others occasionally but only for business matters, such as reviewing the company's [[sexual harassment]] policy and mediating conflict between employees. Toby prefers to let angry employees vent to him, after which they feel better and the conflict eventually settles down and solves itself. This strategy worked virtually trouble-free for years until [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] publicly reads off all listed complaints.\n\nToby tries (but usually fails) to enforce corporate policies and rules when Michael disregards them, typified by an incident in which he quashes Michael's plan to invite [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]] to a Casino Night party:\n{{cquote|Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's, uh, you know...there's gambling and alcohol...and it's in our dangerous warehouse...it's a school night, and you know, uh... [[Hooters]] is catering. You know, is that not\u2014is that enough? Should I keep going?}}\n\nToby usually avoids office activities whenever possible and, like most of the staff, only tolerates Michael. He has reached out to Michael several times despite Michael's continued abuse. He gets along with the rest of the staff. When Dwight approached Michael about missing a gift bag during \"[[A Benihana Christmas]]\", Michael suggested stealing it from Toby, much to Toby's later chagrin, as all the office staff had new robes except for him (Pam later gave her robe to Toby, and this increased Toby's unrequited crush on her). Michael on numerous occasions attempts to blame Toby for problems that are clearly his own fault such as in \"[[The Merger (The Office)|The Merger]]\" in which he questions Tony Gardner if he is quitting because of Toby. In \"[[Classy Christmas]]\" Michael vandalizes Holly's Woody doll (a gift from her boyfriend) and tries to convince her Toby did it. Toby denies it and says the vandalism is something Michael would do.\n\nHe seems to have plain bad luck in many instances. He seems to accept this way of life as inescapable, which may be the cause of his sad disposition. On some occasions, Toby enjoys some rewards and good fortune, much to his satisfaction (and to Michael's annoyance).\n\nToby's favorite movies are ''[[Say Anything...]]'', ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', ''[[Annie Hall]]'', and ''[[Toy Story 2]]''.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/10/27/tv-squad-visits-the-set-of-the-office/ | title = TV Squad Visits the Set of: The Office | last = Kelly | first = Kevin | work = TV Squad | date = 2006-10-27 | accessdate = 2007-02-04 }}</ref> He also likes short stories, mystery novels, and \"old hard-boiled detective\" movies. One of his favorite TV shows is ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]''.\n\nHe lived in [[Honolulu]] for a year and stated in \"[[Branch Closing]]\" that he would take severance from the closing, sell his house, and move to [[Costa Rica]]. In \"[[Local Ad]]\", it is revealed that he worked in advertising for three years before coming to Dunder Mifflin. According to a deleted scene from the episode \"[[Launch Party]]\", he is [[colorblind]]. Toby is also allergic to mushrooms (\"[[Survivor Man]]\").\n\nToby has an ongoing concern about the air quality at the office that borders on an obsession. He worked a recommendation that the air be tested into his goodbye toast in a deleted scene from \"[[Goodbye, Toby]];\" he ignored the two factions that wanted to use an unexpected surplus for new chairs or a new copier and said the money should go to air testing; and he put together a meeting to discuss the radon testing kits he was dispersing in \"[[The Chump (The Office)|The Chump]].\"\n\n==Relationships==\n\nToby is seen as an awkward and quiet guy in the office. He is often passive when he is teased or when he gets picked on and does not appear to know how to stand up for himself. While members of the office have shown disgust at Michael's treatment of Toby, for unknown reasons, nobody has ever stood up for Toby when Michael insults him or excludes him from events, but he is generally liked in the office. The others possibly avoid standing up for him as Michael has authority over them (unlike Toby) and could potentially punish them for speaking up or possibly because they do not want to suffer the same treatment Toby suffers from Michael. Toby, however, has never asked anyone for help when Michael mistreats him, which is possibly the reason why no one ever stands up for him.\n\nBesides Michael, the other staff members treat Toby with respect,  for example, after Toby conducts a brief sexual harassment seminar, the staff is left in a good mood and laughing, until Michael comes in and takes over, however there have been others who occasionally like Michael treat him poorly, insult him and lose their patience such as Kevin, Dwight and Jim and in later seasons, Andy and Nellie. Toby himself is occasionally an annoyance to some, such as Jim, but despite this he is considered one of the few intelligent people in the office, being in the \"Finer Things Club\" with Pam and Oscar. His behavior does change somewhat when he meets Nellie (whom he develops a romance for), and he is shown to become somewhat of nuisance to her by being socially awkward and not handling his crush on her with any subtlety (and also an annoyance to Andy, though this is more of a Michael Scott-like situation where Andy gets angry and frustrated at Toby for doing his HR job at the expense of Andy's weirder/less legal ideas).\n\n===Michael===\n\nMichael despises Toby because, according to Michael, his job is to \"make the office fun, while [Toby's] job is to make the office lame\". Michael's often-successful self-delusions that he is the life of the party frequently have a light shined on them by Toby's interactions with him. This is usually not Toby's intention, but his inability to go along with Michael's vibe is like a mirror being held up to Michael. It shows him the truth that he is constantly hiding from. In their bitter relationship, Michael is clearly the antagonist and Toby the victim. Michael seems to be completely blind to how harsh his treatment of Toby is and claims that Toby is the bad guy and that he tortures him (he points this out to Holly in \"Goodbye Toby\"), completely ignoring that he verbally puts Toby down on a daily basis while the latter simply does his job and voices his own opinion and attempts to dissuade Michael from ideas that are truly reckless and impulsive and unethical in the office. Even on occasions where Toby offers kindness to Michael such as in \"The Deposition\" and \"Niagara\", Michael shows nothing but rudeness and hatred.\n\nMichael viewed Toby as his sworn enemy and took every opportunity to demean him. As Michael sneers, \"Toby is in [[human resources|HR]], which technically means he works for corporate, so he's really not a part of our family. Also, he's divorced, so he's really not a part of ''his'' family\" and says that \"Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry.\" He also stated, \"I hate so much about the things that you choose to be\" (immediately following the above quote from Toby regarding the Casino Night). At various times, Michael has referred to Toby as \"the worst human being ever\", a \"convicted rapist\", \"evil snail\", \"animal rapist\", \"[[Satan]]\" and \"the [[Antichrist]].\" Michael once says that if he \"had a gun with two bullets and was in a room with [[Hitler]], [[Osama bin Laden|Bin Laden]] and Toby, [he] would shoot Toby twice.\" Michael has physically hurt Toby on a few occasions as well such as throwing a pen at his forehead and checking him while skating.\n\nMichael frequently threatened to fire Toby, which he could not do because Toby is not considered a local branch employee, having been hired by the corporate office and then assigned to Scranton. The majority of Michael's techniques that are questionable bring Toby by his own obligation to confront Michael about how corporate would like him to do his job. Ultimately Toby and Michael represent the conflict between employees and upper management. While Toby is mainly a passive victim to Michael's abuse who tries his best to remain calm, Toby himself has shown on a few occasions in the series that he enjoys seeing Michael in misery such as when he injures his foot and collapses and struggles in the restroom (where Michael is disgusted by the idea of Toby helping him instead of Ryan, and Toby gets to mock Michael's wimpiness and notes with disdain \"you only grilled your foot\") and when Toby viciously beats Michael in a game of poker, in which he says he will chase the feeling of taking Michael's money. Toby has also laughed at Michael's misfortune on occasion such as in \"The Deposition\" when Toby learns that Michael thinks Ryan is hot and also in \"Koi Pond\" when he learns Michael has fallen into two fountains. Toby once even instructed Pam on how to hit Michael harder after he gave her the opportunity to do so for dating and dumping her mother, showing that he enjoys seeing Michael suffer to a degree. Toby has on occasion stood up to Michael such as in \"Classy Christmas\" when Michael tries to accuse Toby of destroying Holly's beloved Woody doll, to which Toby immediately responds that the vandalism is something that Michael would do, to which everyone agrees. Toby seems to have a strong ability to absorb Michael's abuse as seen in \"Goodbye Toby\" where he is given a potential opportunity to complain about Michael's antics and after Michael threatens to kill him (though he does so in a situation where Holly and Pam would be able to listen to Toby's issues if he wanted to present them, as they either do not know how awful Michael has been to him or, in Pam's case, know it very well), Toby claims that everything in the office is fine, and later shrugs to the camera that he has survived Michael's abuse long enough and that disclosing it is pointless. Toby has never attempted in any way to get Michael punished for his harsh treatment of him (despite having the power to do so) and has never gotten angry with him for unknown reasons. This stands in direct contrast to other members of the Office who get angered at Michael for his stupidity and rudeness such as Jim, Pam, and (notably) Stanley. Toby also somewhat seems to be in denial that Michael hates him as seen in \"[[New Guys]]\" in which after shooting down his impulsive idea, Andy says to Toby: \"Now I know why Michael hated you so much\", to which Toby responds \"No, he didn't\", possibly signifying that Toby does not view Michael's abuse as hatred. Michael himself has even shown shock at Toby's passive attitude to his abusive actions, notably seen in \"Frame Toby\" when after he and Dwight attempt to frame Toby for being a marijuana user in order to get him fired, Michael actually feels true guilt and attempts to stop it though is absolutely shocked after the situation is resolved when Toby expresses anger for them wasting the cop's time, all the while completely ignoring the fact that he potentially could have been arrested and fired from his job, possibly showing that Michael also hates Toby for allowing himself to be abused and not standing up for himself.\n\nToby seems to want Michael's friendship but is too shy to talk to him about it. In \"[[The Lover (The Office)|The Lover]]\", Michael opens up to Toby, asking him to keep Pam under control, by giving Toby a hug and calling him a \"good guy.\" Toby says that he is delighted and \"Michael would like me once he got to know me\", but as soon as Toby fails to keep Pam under control, Michael starts to hate him again. Michael, though, ended up being appreciative of Toby's efforts to actually help him during their Sabre-mandated counseling sessions (even if he spent much of the time hurling harsh statements at the HR rep), to the point where he decided to talk to Toby instead of simply signing off on a few corrected forms at the sessions' end. While in \"Take Your Daughter to Work Day\", Michael ends up bonding with Toby's daughter Sasha when the employees bring their children into the office. However, later on, Michael becomes withdrawn and sad that he has not had any children, which Toby senses and ends up being confidant to Michael. Michael inquires about being Sasha's godfather. Toby simply tells him that she already has one. Michael has on a few occasions realized when his mistreatment of Toby has gone too far such as in \"[[Women's Appreciation]]\" in which he literally asked him to expose his genitals and also in the aforementioned \"Frame Toby\" after attempting to get Toby arrested and fired, possibly showing that Michael's hatred of Toby has limits.\n\nIn \"[[Goodbye, Michael]]\", when Michael wants to give everyone in the office a proper goodbye, he somewhat makes up for all the times he has berated and insulted Toby by listening to him without insulting him once, possibly showing that he will miss Toby somewhat. However, his face betrays both his difficulty in doing so and his horror when an appreciative Toby suggests that Michael look up Toby's brother Rory in Boulder once he has settled himself in Colorado. This can be viewed as Michael's final comeuppance for his treatment of Toby as even though he is moving away to Colorado, he will still not escape Toby and will have to endure annoyance from Toby's brother Rory (who seems to be virtually identical to him and whom Toby encourages to be friends with Michael).\n\n===Pam===\nPam and Toby are shown to have a good relationship. Pam has shown much displeasure at Michael's harsh treatment of Toby. Toby has had a crush on Pam ever since she called off her wedding with Roy and Jim went to Stamford, but he is too shy to tell her his feelings. In \"[[Cocktails (The Office)|Cocktails]]\" Toby spends his whole evening trying to win a stuffed animal duck at a claw machine for her. When he finally wins, Pam gives back the stuffed animal and asks, \"Don't you have a daughter?\" In \"[[Dunder Mifflin Infinity]]\" Toby is the first to find out about Jim and Pam's relationship when he sees her kiss him on the cheek in the break room. Upset about Pam's new relationship, he sends out a memo asking for no personal displays of affection in the office. In the episode \"[[Business School (The Office)|Business School]]\", Pam asks Toby to come to her art show, and he says he cannot make it because of his daughter's play. He then gets really upset and yells, \"Damn it!\" and questions if maybe he does not have to go to see his daughter's play and instead could go see Pam's art show.\n\nIn \"[[Night Out (The Office episode)|Night Out]]\", Pam thinks that a joke Toby told was funny, and he gets really excited and puts his hand on her leg. After an awkward silence, Toby announces his move to Costa Rica. While shocked that he touched her, Pam does not appear to be angered at Toby for this in subsequent episodes. In \"[[Goodbye, Toby]]\" Pam gives to Toby an office picture of the staff that excludes her (because she took the picture herself) for when he leaves for Costa Rica. Toby, unsatisfied by the lack of her presence, shouts at the office staff asking for a camera (possibly the loudest he has ever spoken). When no one responds, he runs off for an extended amount of time just to find a camera to have a picture of her and him together. Pam also helps Toby take revenge against Michael in this episode after his insulting farewell gift is exposed during a meeting and she gets him to unwillingly give up his watch to Toby. At the end of the episode, Pam comments (though not to Toby) that she always thought he was kind of cute and that she will miss him a lot.\n\nIn \"[[Niagara (The Office)|Niagara]]\" Toby appears to still have feelings for Pam and is happy when they run out on their wedding. He is later disappointed when the wedding is called back on but is seen smiling and clapping after they're married and run down the aisle. In \"Double Date\", Toby instructs Pam on how to punch Michael even harder for revenge for him dating and dumping her mother, which Pam appears to appreciate. During \"[[Roy's Wedding]]\", while Jim and Pam are trying to find out if there is anything they do not know about each other, Toby correctly answers facts about Pam. Everyone notices him, and Toby, clearly embarrassed, attempts to cover it up. There have been a few occasions when Pam has mistreated Toby somewhat such as hanging up on him on the phone after Toby gave her helpful advice and telling him to get out of the room before Michael (stressed over a breakup) arrives and notably in \"Paper Airplane\" after hitting him in the eye with a paper airplane and getting angry at him for crossing (to which Toby apologizes). Pam in response does not apologize and simply asks whether she is still in the contest despite injuring and temporally blinding Toby. In the series finale, while dancing with Pam, Toby began sobbing. Pam questions Toby with \"Is it me? Is it Nellie?\" Toby shakes his head, and responds with \"It's everything.\" Pam then hugs Toby as he weeps.\n\n===Jim===\nJim mentions that when he first started working at Dunder Mifflin, he shared a cubicle with Toby and that the two of them got along well. Michael moved them apart because he thought that the two talked too much. In deleted scenes from [[The Fire (The Office)|The Fire]] and [[Take Your Daughter to Work Day (The Office)|Take Your Daughter to Work Day]] it's implied that Toby and Jim are friends and Jim babysits Toby's daughter on occasion. When Jim becomes Co-Regional Manager with Michael in season six, however, Jim almost begins to mirror Michael's treatment of Toby somewhat. In \"[[The Lover (The Office)|The Lover]]\", when Toby casually says \"Hey Jim,\" a stressed Jim snaps \"Not now Toby! My God!\" leaving Toby bewildered and hurt (Jim however had just been angered upon learning that Michael is dating Pam's mother behind their backs). In the earlier \"[[Survivor Man]]\", after Toby demands that he get a birthday party that Michael previously took away from him and a cake, a frustrated Jim says about Toby \"He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much\", showing that he sees Toby as being annoying sometimes, which is further proven in the episode \"Dwight Christmas\" in which he and Darryl immediately leave the kitchen when Toby starts talking about his work on the Scranton Strangler case (implying Toby never stops talking about it). Jim was aware of Toby's crush on Pam but never seemed very bothered by it, aside from the episode \"Night Out\" in which he is shown to be shocked when Toby awkwardly touches Pam's leg. However, Jim has shown disgust at Michael's treatment of Toby on occasion.\n\nHowever, Toby would occasionally be bitter towards Jim, as seen in \"[[Did I Stutter?]]\" where he assists Ryan (now vice president of Dunder Mifflin) in giving Jim a formal warning for his job performance and criticizes him very bitterly in \"Branch Wars\" when Pam reluctantly allows Jim to join the Finer Things Club, though this likely all stems from Toby's jealousy of Jim's relationship with Pam. During \"[[Stairmageddon]]\", Jim turns to Toby for advice on marriage counseling due to Toby's past of going to such counseling. Jim is left thoughtful and concerned when Toby notes that Pam is in a very difficult situation of short-term vs. long-term issues with Jim's work at Athlead. Despite the moments mentioned above, Jim and Toby have a decent relationship.\n\n===Kelly and Ryan===\nToby shares the Annex with Kelly, and he is exasperated at being in the close proximity of Kelly and Ryan's juvenile romantic escapades. Using the excuse that he was allergic to his desk, Toby moved locations to escape [[Kelly Kapoor|Kelly's]] constant talking, moving out of the cubicle, albeit only to a desk adjacent to it. Toby later wonders if Michael intentionally moved Ryan to his former area in order to torture him via Ryan and Kelly's endless fighting, commenting that \"If he did... genius.\" Kelly stated in a deleted scene from [[Goodbye, Toby]] that she was attracted to Toby but could not stand \"his stupid kid\" and was visibly downcast when he announced his plans to leave the office and move to Costa Rica. Toby overall has a good relationship with both Kelly and Ryan and the two have never mistreated him in any way and once even attempted to encourage him to punch Michael in \"Frame Toby\", possibly showing that they are disgusted at Michael's harsh treatment of Toby.\n\n===Darryl===\nIn a deleted scene from \"[[Ben Franklin (The Office episode)|Ben Franklin]]\", when warehouse foreman [[Darryl Philbin]] is told that Michael has sent Toby home to prevent him from interfering with the hiring of a stripper, Darryl refers to Toby (\"that red-haired guy with the sad eyes\") as a cool guy. While on a trip to the Corporate offices with Darryl and Michael in \"[[The Negotiation]]\", Darryl also offers to let Toby crash for the night at a relative's house in New York, denying Michael the same opportunity. He also had a nickname for Toby (\"T-dog\") at one point, though their relationship soured when Dwight's plan to expose Darryl's worker's compensation fraud led to embarrassment for all of them and Toby insulted Darryl and his sister. Despite this, the two seem to have a good relationship and Darryl once gave Toby his Christmas doll to give to his daughter Sasha, after Toby paid him $400, which was double the price that Dwight sold them at.\n\n===Andy===\nToby and Andy did not appear to have any major disputes when Andy was a salesman (aside from the episode \"Casual Friday\") or during his first year as manager and seemed to have a good relationship.  In \"[[New Guys]]\", when Toby shoots down Andy's unethical idea to make up a cause to fire [[Nellie Bertram]], Andy responds \"now I know why Michael hated you so much\", Toby appeared dismayed at this.  Andy later ridiculed both Toby and Nellie during the slacklining later in the episode.  Andy continued his irritability in \"[[Work Bus]]\" when asking Toby \"how are you not murdered every hour\", suggesting he, like Michael and Jim before him, has inherited the typical manager's disdain for Toby. Andy was occasionally nasty to Toby on a few other occasions as well and even groped Toby before quitting Dunder Mifflin.\n\nToby appeared aware of Andy's poor treatment of Erin as a girlfriend, which he pointed out to Nellie in \"[[Customer Loyalty (The Office)|Customer Loyalty]]\". In the finale, however, after Andy returns with a more positive and friendly attitude, Toby is pleased to hear him (and several other staff members) encourage him to join them at the after party in the warehouse, implying the two are now on good terms.\n\n===Dwight===\nToby and Dwight appear to have a stable relationship and Dwight does not appear to hate Toby like Michael does, though on a few occasions Dwight has helped Michael make Toby miserable such as trying to get him arrested and fired once he returned from his vacation from Costa Rica (even more enthusiastically and intently than Michael) and stealing a Christmas present from him on Michael's orders and attempting to sabotage him in \"Fun Run\". Dwight also made no attempt to help Toby when he was selling Christmas dolls and ran out just as Toby asked for one for his daughter. Dwight has also on a few occasions laughed at Michael's insults towards Toby but has also shown some displeasure when Michael takes it too far such as in \"Goodbye Toby\", where he himself admits that he thought Michael's idea to give Toby a rock as a goodbye present was over the line. It is likely that Dwight makes Toby miserable due to his loyalty to Michael, however even after Michael left Dwight would occasionally still mistreat Toby and insult him, once even calling him \"the most forgettable man in the known world\" and having Robert California's son pretend to fire him. The two have gotten along on a few occasions and it is revealed that Dwight complains to Toby all the time about Jim's pranks against him and once made a deal with him to sign a petition of his in exchange for cookies from Toby's daughter. Toby and Dwight also share an interest in trains during a conversation while spying on Darryl and Dwight says he is welcome anytime to come to his farm.\n\nToby has on occasion been stern with Dwight, notably in \"Casual Friday\", in which he threatened to write him up if he did not sit down and has foiled some of Dwight's dangerous schemes such as leaving weapons in the office and stopping Dwight from wearing dangerous costumes to Halloween (for which Dwight threatens to kill him). In the final episode of the series, Dwight fires Toby alongside Kevin (though less harshly), possibly indicating that he dislikes Toby and that he annoys him to a degree, like his predecessors Michael, Jim, and Andy (or possibly on orders from Corporate or to prevent him from interfering in his firing of Kevin). While Dwight states that he misses Kevin after firing him, he never states the same for Toby. Dwight does, however, invite him to his wedding, possibly showing that he does consider him a friend.\n\n===Nellie===\nIn \"[[Get the Girl]]\"<ref>[[Get the Girl]]</ref> Toby introduces himself to Nellie as Tony, to which Pam replies \"You messed up saying your name?\" He answers her by saying, \"It happens, okay?\"\n\nIn \"[[Dwight Christmas]]\", at the office Christmas party, Nellie expressed interest upon hearing that Toby had been a juror in the Scranton Strangler case.  He proceeds to bore her, however, with a long, drawn-out account that is implied to have lasted for several hours.  Nellie finally leans in close and shushes him.  A puzzled Toby then asks if she is about to kiss him.  Attempting to save face, Nellie gives him a small kiss, which causes an emboldened Toby to give her a much more passionate kiss.\n\nToby does not appear in the two subsequent episodes, during which the events of the party are not referenced.  In \"[[Customer Loyalty (The Office)|Customer Loyalty]]\", however, he appears very tactile and affectionate towards Nellie, apparently under the impression that the two are now in a relationship.  Nellie, for her part, had forgotten the kiss until that point and finds Toby's affection somewhat awkward.\n\nIn \"[[Moving On (The Office)|Moving On]]\", Nellie gets fed up with Toby's constant hand-wringing over the possible non-guilt of the convicted Scranton Strangler and pushes him to visit the man in prison; when the Strangler proves he is the killer and nearly kills Toby himself, Nellie admits Toby was brave and a speechless Toby (his larynx was injured by the Strangler) looks happy. However, Nellie later firmly establishes her contempt for Toby and there is no further romantic story-line between them. She is also somewhat rude and insulting to him on a few occasions notably in \"Paper Airplane\" in which she speaks of him as being a loser, however, Nellie's poor treatment of him could stem from Toby's awkward and annoying behaviour towards her.\n\nWhen Toby returns to Scranton for the reunion and Angela and Dwight's wedding, Nellie (also returning to Scranton from her new home in Poland) lets the camera crew know she is not thrilled about seeing Toby again. At the airport, Nellie rebuffs an attempted hug from Toby, snidely brushes aside his comment about a relationship she ended by saying she un-followed him on Facebook and questions him of how long he has been stalking her (Toby quietly says anyone can read non-protected tweets) and declines his offer to share a cab into town. After that point, Toby has no further interactions of any kind with Nellie.\n\n===Pete and Clark===\nAfter the departure of Kelly and Ryan, Toby appears more excited with the arrival of the two twenty-somethings who are single like himself.  He appears to see them as closer friends than they see him but neither of them treats him meanly either.  He convinced both of them, along with Kevin and Darryl, to grow moustaches from \"[[Movember]]\", believing this was a bonding activity.  He was disappointed when Pete shaved his moustache off after Erin found it off-putting.\n\nToby appears to consider Pete a better fit for Erin than Andy, largely because he does not appreciate Andy's belittling treatment of him and also because he never had any romantic interest in Erin. At the documentary reunion, Pete is nice to Toby and is visibly happy when Toby decides to attend an after-party he had been planning to skip.\n\n==Seasons 1\u20132==\n\nToby only appears in a few episodes, showing up first in a scene in \"[[Diversity Day (The Office)|Diversity Day]]\", in which he jokes about sitting in an Indian Circle (to which everyone else laughs). Michael, having told many more offensive jokes, is offended by Toby's joke and tells him that \"This is an environment of welcoming, and you should just get the hell out of here.\" Toby does so and the staff suddenly goes very quiet. This is the first instance in the relationship between the two, Toby trying to be responsible, and Michael trying to demean and undermine him as much as possible. In \"[[Hot Girl (The Office)|Hot Girl]]\", Toby is introduced by Michael to Katy the purse saleswoman; after Toby and Katy begin talking happily about their high school days, Michael deliberately humiliates Toby by mentioning his divorce and how he once briefly had to live in his car. He also notices the picture of Toby's daughter on his desk, and refers to her as \"cute\"; however, this is probably a further attempt to portray Toby, a divorced father, as undesirable.<ref>Season 1</ref>\n\nOne of Toby's major appearances was in \"[[Sexual Harassment (The Office episode)|Sexual Harassment]]\", where he holds a Sexual Harassment Meeting for the staff, only to be interrupted by Michael and a blow-up doll. Michael then states that everyone is still \"generally quite happy\", which he thinks is because Toby has not yet had the meeting. In fact, Toby did have the meeting and everyone clapped after he was done, leaving them in a good mood.\n\nIn a deleted scene of \"[[Halloween (The Office episode)|Halloween]]\", Toby tries to persuade Michael to make a decision as to which employee he must fire. When Michael chooses Toby, Toby replies that he does not report to Michael. When Michael then tries to get Toby to quit, Toby replies that someone else will just take his place. Michael then claims that if he had the authority, he would immediately fire Toby, to which Toby calmly replies, \"I know, Michael.\"\n\nIn \"[[Booze Cruise (The Office episode)|Booze Cruise]]\", Toby is late arriving at the dock for a company cruise. When Michael orders the ship to leave without him, Toby grins broadly, implying he had planned things in order to miss the event.\n\nIn \"[[Take Your Daughter to Work Day (The Office episode)|Take Your Daughter to Work Day]]\", Toby's daughter, Sasha, distracts Michael; the two actually get along, showing Michael's friendly side. Toby and Michael have a good conversation about Michael's desire to have a family: Michael wants to have a biological child, and Toby hints that he should seek out alternatives. When Michael asks if Sasha already has a godfather, Toby quickly replies, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"[[Conflict Resolution (The Office episode)|Conflict Resolution]]\" is Toby's biggest role in the season. Toby shows that he handles inter-office complaints calmly and efficiently, only to see his work undone by Michael's stupidity. When Dwight threatens to quit unless Michael fires Jim (because of Jim's history of pranks against Dwight), Michael attempts to resolve the conflict by making vague promises of future action, an approach similar to one Toby had used successfully in the past. Toby covertly shows that he files Dwight's complaints against Jim in a trash box and that he puts the huge number of complaints against Michael in unmarked boxes that are filed into the vast space of the warehouse.\n\nIn \"[[Casino Night (The Office episode)|Casino Night]]\", Toby tries to convince Michael not to invite Boy Scouts to a company Casino Night. Michael's response is to demean him in front of everybody. Toby just lets him finish. That night, however, Toby viciously beats Michael at no-limit Texas Hold 'Em, to Michael's visible irritation. Later, Toby says to the camera, \"I'm not gonna lie\u2014it felt good to take money from Michael. I'm gonna chase that feeling.\"<ref>Season 2</ref>\n\n==Seasons 3\u20134==\nIn \"[[The Convention (The Office episode)|The Convention]]\", after finding out that Pam is no longer engaged, Toby makes a couple of attempts to ask her out but can't say the words. Michael trashes Toby to Jim and eagerly asks Jim if the HR rep is the reason he left for Stamford. Michael is visibly stung when Jim says no (he later tells Michael about his declaration of love for Pam).\n\nIn \"[[The Convict]]\", Michael jokingly refers to Toby as a rapist, much to the dismay of those present. Later, Toby convinces Michael to release the office employees from the conference room, whom he had locked in there as punishment for unfavorably comparing Dunder Mifflin to a prison.\n\nIn \"[[A Benihana Christmas]]\", Michael has Dwight take Toby's gift bag present of an expensive robe when they run out of enough of them for everyone. Pam later comes over and kindly gives her robe to Toby.\n\nIn \"[[Back from Vacation]]\", Toby asks Michael about the \"Jamaica Jan Sun Princess\" photo. Michael tries to accuse Toby of stealing the file from him, but Toby says \"nine different people sent it to me, including my ex-wife, and, well, we don't talk.\" Michael then insults Toby's divorce again and calls him a perv, but does state for the record that he and Jan do not have a relationship.\n\nIn \"[[Phyllis' Wedding]]\", Toby is seen with a beautiful woman whom he says he met in the gym, although Kevin believes she is a paid escort.  When Phyllis tosses her bouquet, it is Toby's date that catches it, and then excitedly runs back to Toby and the two share a brief embrace and kiss. Toby is then shown in a talking head as very ecstatic towards the outcome. It is implied that Toby and his date eventually broke up afterwards as this is the only episode where she is seen.\n\nIn \"[[Business School (The Office episode)|Business School]]\", he tells Pam he cannot make it to her art show because his daughter has a play. He then offers to miss his daughter's play because \"what they do is not art.\"\n\nIn \"[[Cocktails (The Office episode)|Cocktails]]\", Toby spends the whole evening trying to win Pam a duck from a claw machine after she comments on how cute it is. When he finally wins it, Pam suggests that he give it to his daughter instead.\n\nIn \"[[The Negotiation]]\", Toby is forced to listen to Ryan and Kelly bickering nonstop when Michael moves Ryan back to the annex. Toby wonders if Michael did this to punish Toby and that if he did, it was a genius move. Toby goes with Michael and Darryl to New York after Jan says she will not do the contract negotiation unless Toby is there. When Michael repeatedly mentions his and Jan's relationship at that point, Toby takes notes and Michael insults him, but Toby just says he has \"preparing for the deposition\" that he thinks will inevitably occur because Michael threatened to withhold sex from a female superior in order to get a modest, scheduled raise, commenting, \"It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.\" Additionally, when Darryl says he will stay in New York for the night, he tells Toby he can join him and stay at his relative's house, pointedly not extending the same offer to Michael.\n\nIn \"[[Women's Appreciation]]\", Toby is out of the office at a parent-teacher conference when Phyllis is flashed. When he returns, Michael scoffs at his alibi and seriously asks to see his penis to rule him out as a suspect. Toby turns towards Michael and looks like he has about to get angry; Michael then seems to catch himself and admits what he said to Toby was wrong.\n\nIn \"[[Beach Games]]\", Michael bans Toby from attending the beach event because he wants it to be fun and says it will not be if Toby is there. Toby is visibly upset that he will not get to see Pam in a bikini (which she ends up not wearing there) and is seen despondently doing paper work in a deleted scene from the episode.<ref>Season 3</ref>\n\nOn the Season 3 DVD, Toby gives a series of wraparound interviews. Among other things:\n*He lists the various insulting nicknames Michael has for him, including \"The Devil's Butthole\" and \"Gargamel\", noting \"I prefer Toby\".\n*He describes Michael's \"invention\" of a safe George Foreman Grill after he burned his foot, which involved putting the Grill inside a bunny cage.\n*He says that his job is not a nightmare because you wake up from nightmares; it's more like an unrelenting \"daymare\".\n*He lists what he would do if he had one day to live, including wanting to \"Burn this place (The Office) to the ground\" this makes the interviewer react with horror and/or disbelief which Toby responds to with a confused \"What?\".\n*He says, \"HR isn't just a job, it's a way of life. (Pause) But I wish it was just a job.\"<ref>Season 3 DVD</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Fun Run]]\", Toby goes against [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael's]] theory of an office curse by mentioning he won a drawing at a local pizza place, but Michael insults him and later ignores his statement that you cannot ask employees about their religions. Before the race, Dwight puts [[Imodium]] in Toby's drink instead of Ex-Lax and Michael pulls Toby's shorts down right before the starting gun is fired. Toby later wins the race to cure rabies, beating Michael and accomplishing something noteworthy; however, no one notices his win, and Kelly does not even bother looking up when he crosses the finish line. Toby then wonders why the 5K course was a straight line instead of a circle that would have returned everyone to the Dunder Mifflin building.\n\nIn \"[[Dunder Mifflin Infinity]]\", after seeing Pam kiss Jim, Toby sends out a memo about public displays of affection. When Michael accosts Toby about the memo (thinking it's about him and Jan having sex in the office), Toby tells him, in front of everyone, that it is about Jim and Pam. When they confirm that they are dating everyone is happy, except Toby. Later Pam and Jim visit him to see if they have to sign a \"Love Contract\", but he tells them to wait and see. In a scene that was added to the episode's repeat airing on NBC, Toby comes into work with a woman he says is his girlfriend and makes out with her right in front of the reception desk and Pam.\n\nIn \"[[Money (The Office)|Money]]\", Toby shows that he uses very good grammar when he corrects Michael and clears up a confusion between the usages of the words \"whoever\" and \"whomever\" (\"who\" is used as a [[subject (grammar)|subject]], while \"whom\" is used as an [[object (grammar)|object]]). Michael responds by telling Toby to shove a letter opener in his skull.\n\nIn a deleted scene of \"[[Local Ad]]\", Toby pitches an idea of having a stop motion ad that Michael, of course, puts down although the rest of the office seems to like the idea. When the local ad is being played at the bar, Toby is in the ad, but only briefly. While Michael was shooting the scene of the paper airplane flying out of the hand of Creed towards the conference room window, you see Toby in the conference room packing up whatever work he was finishing. Michael did not want Toby in the video; however, for a fleeting moment, Toby had managed to unintentionally get a part in the ad.\n\nToby's distaste for Pam's relationship with Jim is again brought up in \"[[Branch Wars]]\" when Jim is allowed to join \"The Finer Things Club\", an exclusive organization built up by Pam, Toby, and Oscar, dedicated to discussing civilized culture. During the episode's final scene, after Jim contributes his ideas on the book being discussed, Toby scrutinizes him very bitterly, hinting again at his disdain for Jim's success with Pam. His irritation is attributed to the fact that Jim did not read the book, though Oscar and even Pam are also annoyed with Jim's wisecracking, uninformed behavior. Also in this episode Michael tells Karen she can have Toby instead of Stanley; when Karen says Toby is not a salesperson, Michael briefly tries to talk up Toby's ability to learn before saying he cannot fake it and insulting the HR rep anew.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Survivor Man]]\", Toby ends up getting on Jim's nerves. When Jim is named Acting Manager while Michael is off on his \"wilderness adventure\" and starts altering the office's birthday schedule, Toby asks Jim if he can have a birthday celebration, explaining that Michael deliberately held a party for Toby at 4:58 PM on a Friday so no one would attend. Jim agrees but comments that he likes Toby but that the guy is really annoying him, claiming that sometimes Toby can sometimes be a little bit much. Jim's dismissive, disgusted attitude toward Toby (whom he has always gotten along with before) very closely mirrors how Michael treats Toby. It is not clear whether Jim is genuinely fed up with Toby or whether this interplay showed that Jim was beginning to act like Michael. It is also possible that Jim was not annoyed at Toby specifically but at the general reaction to his plan. Jim's disgusted attitude can also be attributed to the fact that Toby has been treating Jim fairly poorly in previous episodes due to his jealousy of his relationship with Pam.\n\nMichael's hatred for Toby is brought up again in \"[[The Deposition (The Office episode)|The Deposition]]\" when Michael says he does not want Toby in the deposition and nastily asks if the HR rep is there \"to renew your divorce vows\" (Toby is also sitting a conspicuous distance from Michael in the uncrowded room being used for the proceedings). When the two happen to sit next to each other at lunch, Toby kindly tells Michael that he can relate to Michael's situation, of Toby's parents' divorce. While Toby is talking, Michael pushes Toby's lunch tray on the floor, then gets up and leaves. Later in the episode, Toby begins to laugh at Michael after learning Michael thinks Ryan is \"hot.\" Also, after Jan's attorney brings out Michael's diary, and the head of the deposition says \"Okay, we'll need ten copies of that diary\", to which Toby says, \"Make that eleven.\" In a deleted scene, Michael asks Toby if he will tell Meredith that the car accident from [[Fun Run]] was Michael's fault, and Toby nods.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Night Out (The Office episode)|Night Out]]\", he puts his hand on Pam's leg and caresses it for a long, awkward moment, which everyone standing around seems to notice, making this the first time the employees see Toby's possible crush on Pam. Immediately thereafter, realizing what he had just done, he abruptly announces that he is moving to [[Costa Rica]], runs outside to the security fence, scales it, and disappears into the night. This scene was done by a stunt double, as Lieberstein wanted to do it himself but it was decided for insurance reasons to let the stuntman do his work.\n\nIn \"[[Did I Stutter?]]\", Toby and Ryan together (who both have a problem with Jim; Toby dislikes him for dating Pam and Ryan dislikes him for going over his head) warn Jim on his job performance, citing specifically his indifference toward his job and use of time (namely \"goofing off with Dwight\" and \"time spent at Reception\" with Pam). Toby then says to the camera that Jim's time spent with Pam \"has finally caught up to him\", but he repeats Pam's name several times when unnecessary. Toby later says, though, that he agrees that Jim has good numbers but Ryan thinks they are not good enough. In the same episode, Toby convinces Michael he needs to deal with [[Stanley Hudson|Stanley]] for his open [[insubordination]] during a staff meeting, though Michael goes about it a different way because Toby's method \"did not work because it was stupid.\" Michael also says Toby does not have any friends, but Michael does so in the context of stating that Stanley is Michael's friend, which is later shown to be completely inaccurate as Stanley despises him for his stupidity and is not afraid to confront Michael about it. It is also shown that Dwight thinks Toby may be [[Jewish]], as Dwight's org chart shows a blue [[Star of David]] with a question mark next to Toby's name; Toby did not say what (if any) religion he practiced when Michael prodded the staffers to talk about their religious practices in [[Fun Run]]. As Toby spent time in a seminary (as revealed in season five episode \"[[Casual Friday (The Office)|Casual Friday]]\") he is most likely a Roman Catholic.\n\nIn \"[[Goodbye, Toby]]\", he follows through on his earlier plans and quits his job as HR representative to move to Costa Rica. Michael is overjoyed at his departure and plans to throw a lavish goodbye party that reflects this. Both Kelly and Pam say they are sorry he is leaving, with Pam saying in an interview that she thinks he is kind of cute. Toby also ends up annoying Holly, his replacement, to a degree while showing her around the office and she is somewhat rude to him and claims that he almost bored her to sleep, something which Michael enjoys hearing (Holly remains oblivious that Michael, in fact, abuses Toby and Michael claims that Toby tortures him, though it is possible she only puts Toby down so as to get on Michael's good side). Toby faces a cruel exit interview from Michael but the tables are turned when Holly and Pam join the interview. Michael is unable to berate Toby at length as Holly takes over. When Toby is asked; \"What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?\", Toby claims he has a few ideas. Realizing that Toby has a potential opportunity to reveal and complain about his unethical work behavior and abusive treatment, Michael hides his face and angrily glares at Toby and silently threatens to kill him if he answers the question. Toby does not seem afraid but simply gives a \"things are OK as they are\" answer. Toby later tells the camera that he has made it far enough without disclosing Michael's behavior and that there is no point in doing so.\n\nToby gets revenge when Michael's insulting farewell gift to him is exposed (a rock with a note reading: \"Suck on this!\") and Pam gets Michael to unwillingly give up his watch to Toby, which he does, clearly upset. Toby's main concern on his last day is getting pictures of himself alone with Pam, which he finally does as his party is ending. Michael gets a last dig in by having Hank the security guard escort Toby out of the office as he leaves for his new life in Costa Rica and is still shown to be upset when Toby looks at his new watch. In a deleted scene at his farewell party, Toby refers to an undefined incident involving his sister; this marks the first time Toby has mentioned having any siblings, although late in season 7 he reveals also having a brother Rory.<ref>Season 4</ref>\n\n==Seasons 5\u20136==\n\nIn season five, Toby is revealed to be in traction in a Costa Rican hospital, with a broken neck, after a [[zip-line]] accident on his third day in Costa Rica. He explains that he has yet to see the beach, but expresses some happiness with the camera crew for visiting. He also implies in an earlier talk with Oscar that he is attracted to a woman who is visiting a nearby resort with her husband, thus continuing his tendency to fall for unavailable women \u00e0 la Pam. In a deleted scene from [[Baby Shower (The Office)|Baby Shower]], Toby can be heard on the speakerphone with [[Holly Flax|Holly]], noting that he enjoys his stay at the hospital more than his treatment from Michael at the office.\n\nIn \"[[Frame Toby]]\", it is revealed that Toby had returned to the office for a week without Michael noticing. When the staff tells Michael that Toby is back, Michael thinks it's a joke until he sees Toby and screams \"No God! Please No! No!\" Michael asks David Wallace to get rid of Toby but the CFO says he can not fire Toby without cause. Michael then attempts to get Toby fired by giving Pam a fake letter to give to Toby, asking him to hug and kiss her no matter how much she resisted, and taunting the HR rep into punching him, but both plans fail. Michael then tries out Dwight's idea of planting drugs in Toby's desk (unknowingly buying [[basil]] from a [[caprese salad]] from warehouse workers who he thinks sold him [[marijuana]]). However, he does feel guilty about what he has done and, when the police are investigating the \"drugs\", Michael tells the police that it's a mistake and tries to stop them from arresting Toby. This suggests that, while Michael does hate Toby, there are limits to his hatred. Then again, Toby's reaction to the setup\u2014that it wasted the cops' time that could have been used to deal with law enforcement\u2014inspires more shock and disgust from Michael.\n\nHe is seen on occasion in the background in the \"Annex\" of the office. When Michael gives his two weeks notice, Toby shows he is not as resentful towards Michael as Michael is to him in a talking head, referring to him as a movie on an airplane, which is nothing special but something to watch. He was seen breaking up a jam session in the lunch room up between Dwight and Andy who were attempting to impress the new receptionist with guitar and banjo to the song \"[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]\" by [[John Denver]]. Toby simply says, \"You have to stop.\"\n\nIn \"[[Stress Relief (The Office)|Stress Relief]]\", Toby is seen attempting to help the others escape Dwight's fire drill. In the second part of the episode, during the roasting of Michael, Toby begins to walk to the mike but Michael stops him declaring that only friends are allowed to roast him and Toby agrees and sits back down and laughs with the rest of the audience at Michael being roasted. It is possible Michael stopped Toby from roasting him not only because they are not friends but because Toby would have the worst things to say about him.\n\nHe is also involved in the episode \"[[Casual Friday (The Office)|Casual Friday]]\" where he has a talking head about his beginnings at Dunder Mifflin. He used to be in seminary, but he left because he wanted to have sex with a girl named Kathy and took the HR job at Dunder Mifflin so he could be with her. Kathy is revealed to be the name of his ex-wife, and he does not appear to have a passion for HR. In the same episode, he has to deal with complaints about a too relaxed dress code by Oscar and Meredith. For the first time, he is stern with his employees and enforces HR policy by cancelling Casual Fridays at the office.<ref>Season 5</ref>\n\nIn the episode \"[[Gossip (The Office)|Gossip]]\", Michael spreads rumors about various people throughout the Office, including that Toby is a virgin, even though he has a daughter.\n\nIn the episode \"[[The Meeting (The Office)|The Meeting]]\", Dwight and Toby investigate a dishonest workman's compensation claim filed by Darryl, an event which results in Dwight and Darryl filing complaints against each other, leaving Toby to \"drown in a sea of paperwork.\" During the episode, Toby ends up bonding with Dwight when they share an interest in trains, and finds that Dwight is restoring a life size one in his slaughterhouse.\n\nAlthough he does not appear, directly, in the episode [[The Promotion (The Office)|The Promotion]], Michael and Jim put baked beans on pictures of the employees as a way to decide the raises. Jim then sees a drawn picture of what looks to be a clown with a caption saying \"I'm an idiot\" and asks Michael who it is, Michael answers, saying it is Toby. Jim reminds Michael that Toby is not part of this and Michael answers \"I just wanted to draw a picture of him\".\n\nIn the episode \"[[Niagara (The Office)|Niagara]]\", Toby kindly offers Michael the second bed he has in his room but Michael insults him by telling him he will be sleeping alone for the rest of his life and walks away. Toby seems to at least have some feelings left for Pam, as he seems to be happy when reacting to a possibility of Jim and Pam's wedding being called off. When the wedding does go on, however, he is seen dancing with the others and cheering Jim and Pam on as they walk down the aisle at the ceremony's end.\n\nIn the following episode, \"[[Mafia (The Office)|Mafia]]\", Oscar comments that with Jim and Pam off on their honeymoon and Toby having \"mentally checked out in June\" he is the only person left to counter insane antics with rational thinking. When hearing of Oscar's comments Toby casually agrees with him.<ref>Season 6</ref>\n\nIn the episode \"[[The Lover (The Office)|The Lover]]\",  Toby is yelled at by both Michael and Jim when he walks in on them just after Michael has told Jim he is dating Pam's mom. Later, after Pam blew up at Michael in the conference during an office meeting, Michael comes to Toby desperate to make Pam happy about his relationship with her mother. Toby offers to talk to Pam for Michael and Michael even goes as far as hugging Toby and calls him a good good-guy. Toby is extremely happy at the hope that things will finally change between them that he says \"you know I always knew that if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we would be friends.\" But once Toby is unable to smooth things over, Michael dismisses Toby as a jackass and goes right back to hating him.\n\nIn the episode \"Koi Pond\", Toby is present in the meeting where Michael wants to talk about insults in the office and as usual when Toby simply makes a point Michael insults him by calling him a waste of life, though corrects himself claiming that's what he would like to say but the meeting is an insult free zone. However, when Michael reveals he has fallen into two fountains Toby appears to find this funny and laughs at Michael. After this, he asks for Michael to kick him out of the meeting and Michael tells him to go.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Double Date (The Office)|Double Date]]\", Toby talks to Pam to make sure she plans on hitting Michael off grounds. He then gives Pam some tips on how to punch harder, even going through motions with her on how to do it as Michael watches on from his office, visibly afraid.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Secret Santa (The Office)|Secret Santa]]\", Toby is called \"[[Antichrist]]\" for calling Michael's Jesus costume inappropriate. In \"[[The Banker (The Office)|The Banker]]\" Toby is interviewed by an investment banker as he evaluates the branch. Michael tries to have Toby distracted while Dwight impersonates him but Toby appears and makes Dwight leave. Despite knowing of several questionable incidents that have taken place in the office, he does not say anything to the banker. He expresses his torn feelings about this in a talking head.\n\nIn \"[[Whistleblower (The Office)|Whistleblower]]\", Toby is revealed to have written a few chapters of a mystery novel and receives advice on the plot from Jo Bennett to which he replies in an interview, \"Write your own damn novel!\"\n\n==Seasons 7\u20138==\nIn \"[[Nepotism (The Office)|Nepotism]]\", as a punishment for physically injuring an employee, Michael is sent to a 6-hour counselling with Toby. In a deleted scene, Toby tells the camera crew that he finished writing his book over the summer and got four sales out of his [[self-publishing]] but is being sued for plagiarism.\n\nIn \"[[Counseling (The Office)|Counseling]]\", Toby does counselling for Michael. They briefly become friends as Michael talks to Toby about his life, but when Michael realizes that Toby is, in fact, counselling him, Michael yells at him. Toby reveals that he has a degree in [[social work]]. At the end of the episode, however, he seems to be communicating with Toby civilly, as most of his anger is fixed on Gabe Lewis.\n\nIn \"[[Costume Contest]]\", Toby dresses up as a hobo. In a deleted scene, while using a [[Ouija board]] at the office Hallowe'en party, he mumbles that \"being dead is going to be ''so'' relaxing\", disturbing his co-workers.\n\nIn \"[[Christening (The Office)|Christening]]\", Toby has trouble entering the church where Jim and Pam's baby is being christened. After many false starts, he finally enters the chapel and can be seen in front of the altar asking \"Why do you have to be so mean to me?\"\n\nIn a deleted scene from \"[[WUPHF.com]]\", he is talking with his daughter via web chat, where he finds out through her that his ex-wife has a new boyfriend. Michael shuts off Toby's laptop and then proceeds to talk with him about the situation he is in with Ryan. Toby tries to offer the best advice he can, but as usual, Michael brushes off what he says and then pokes fun at the fact that someone else is banging his wife.\n\nIn \"[[Classy Christmas]]\" Toby has to go on leave so he can report for jury duty. The case turns out to be that of the Scranton Strangler, a fact Toby lets slip out despite his not supposed to be talking about the case. He later says to the camera crew he likes the attention. Michael is visibly disgusted when Toby returns on jury recess to attend the Christmas party and tells the staff to not ask Toby any questions as he will not leave and this will prevent Holly from returning. In the second part of the episode, Michael attempts to frame Toby for vandalizing Holly's beloved Woody Doll but Toby immediately denies it and flips it around on Michael claiming the vandalism is something he would do, to which everyone agrees to eventually.\n\nToby has a minor role in Michael Scott's film \"[[Threat Level Midnight]]\" as a hostage. When the villain Goldenface (played by Jim), decides to show the hero (played by Michael Scott) how serious he is, he decides to kill a hostage, naturally picking Toby. When Goldface shoots Toby's character, his head explodes in an overly dramatic fashion. However, Michael tells Goldenface that the joke is on him, saying that Toby was a \"wanted animal rapist\".\n\nToby returns in \"[[Michael's Last Dundies]]\", where he appears to have lost a considerable amount of weight. In the beginning of the episode, Michael eggs his house in the morning and drives away. Toby is later seen at the Dundies sitting with Jim and Pam. Michael awards Toby with the \"Extreme Repulsiveness\" award (with Deangelo commenting how mean that is). Toby refuses to accept it but is told he has to by the other employees because Michael is leaving. Toby then reluctantly accepts it, but tells Michael he finds the award hateful. He then goes on to say that he is taking advantage of being up on the platform, and lets everyone know that the jury found The Scranton Strangler guilty and that he is being put to death. However, Toby is now having doubts about the verdict, saying he thinks the Strangler might be innocent, but is interrupted by an \"[[Oh Yeah (Yello song)|Oh Yeah]]\" sound effect from Dwight's [[synthesizer]].\n\nIn \"[[Goodbye, Michael]]\", Michael is seen saying goodbye to Toby without insulting him, possibly indicating that he will miss Toby on some level. However, Michael is visibly disgusted when he learns that Toby has a brother, Rory (played by Paul Lieberstein's real-life brother Warren), who lives in [[Boulder, Colorado]] as well. Later, Toby is seen talking to Rory via Skype and tells him he thinks his brother and Michael would \"hit it off in an odd way\". Rory suggests that he could bring Michael a welcome basket, and asks Toby if Michael likes Jams, but Toby informs him that Michael hates them.\n\nIn the beginning of \"[[The Inner Circle (The Office)|The Inner Circle]]\", Deangelo informs Toby that he is getting a new chair, but Deangelo, trying to be confusing so the staff will not \"figure him out\", tells Toby he does not care if he likes it. Toby is still grateful.\n\nIn \"[[Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager]]\", he gets to fill out the gun violence accident form, much to his excitement. After Jo demotes Dwight upon learning of his gun accident, she appoints Toby as one of the search committee members who would be in charge of interviewing candidates for the manager position (along with Jim and Gabe).\n\nIn \"[[The List (The Office)|The List]]\", new CEO [[Robert California]] makes a list of the people in the office, dividing them between perceived \"winners\" and \"losers\"; he takes the winners out to lunch. Although Toby is on the list of \"winners\", he concludes that it must be a mistake, and excuses himself in the middle of lunch.\n\nIn \"[[Lotto (The Office)|Lotto]]\", Toby says in a talking-head interview that if he won the lottery, he would not change his life at all, except for quitting his job, moving away, and maybe re-entering the dating world.<ref>http://www.nbc.com/the-office/video/wondering-about-a-windfall/1361025?auto=true</ref> He also says he would spend a lot of time launching his true-crime podcast, \"The Flenderson Files\".\n\nIn \"[[Garden Party (The Office)|Garden Party]]\", Toby arrives at \"Schrute Farms\" and asks Dwight's cousin, Mose, where to park. Mose states that he is the valet and that Toby has to give him his car. Reluctantly, and after much pressure, Toby lets Mose park his car. It proves to be a bad choice, however, as Mose drives his car straight into a cornfield (though it is not damaged, and becomes the first of many cars parked there in odd, Mose-chosen order).\n\nIn \"[[Spooked (The Office)|Spooked]]\", Dwight and Robert California's son Bert hearken back to the days when Toby was continuously mistreated by Michael when they \"prank\" Toby by telling him he is fired. Toby finds Bert's treatment of him hurtful\u2014especially Bert saying he can have Toby fired because he is the CEO's kid\u2014and Dwight finds the whole bit hilarious.\n\nIn \"[[Test the Store]]\", Toby has a rare substantial role in a Season 8 episode, where he leads a self-defense lecture for the employees after they believe Andy was attacked by a gang and left with a black eye (Toby and everyone else later find out Andy was punched by a rude 4th-grade girl when he defended Pam from a barrage of tossed pine cones). When Toby is not aggressive enough for Kelly Kapoor's taste, she stands up and begins threatening and swinging at him, after which Andy defends Toby and gets punched in his other eye.\n\n==Season 9==\n\nIn \"[[New Guys]]\", Andy returns from [[Outward Bound]] manager training, making him become more \"decisive and confident\". When Andy tells Toby that he plans to fabricate an excuse to fire Nellie, Toby shoots down the idea as a violation of corporate policy, prompting Andy to tell Toby \"I understand why Michael didn't like you.\" When Andy hosts a motivational exercise involving a tightrope, he insults Toby and Nellie in front of the staff. Since that time, Andy has been rude towards Toby in a manner that echoes Michael Scott's hatred of his harmless HR rep, though Toby seems much less affected by Andy's behavior than he was by Michael's. When Andy went off on his long boat trip, Toby's time in the last season was devoted to his unrequited romantic interest in [[Nellie Bertram]] and his belief that he'd convicted an innocent man during his jury time on the Scranton Strangler case (a theory he put to rest when he went to visit the convict in prison and was, in fact, choked and nearly strangled by him). In the series finale, it's revealed that Toby was fired immediately after Dwight fired Kevin Malone (it's likely that the Corporate office fired Toby and Dwight simply had the burden of telling him) and Toby then moved to New York where he is trying to become a novelist and has six roommates. Toby surprises his former co-workers at the reunion panel when he says that his life feels meaningless now that he is not being filmed for the documentary anymore. He breaks down in tears while dancing with Pam at Dwight and Angela's wedding, saying of what's bad in his life that \"It's everything!\", but he seems cheered a little when the group insists he join them for post-wedding festivities. In a photo gallery NBC released of \"where are they now?\" info-bits for the characters, it's revealed that Toby has returned to his destiny by taking on an HR position at a [[TJ Maxx]] store.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{The Office US}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Flenderson, Toby}}\n[[Category:The Office (American TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2005]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Indiana]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "2601:40c:4100:910:a185:61b6:248e:cfe8", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Flenderson"}

The Wolverines were members of the East Division of the [[Big Ten Conference]] and played their home games at [[Michigan Stadium]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. Michigan was coached by [[Jim Harbaugh]], who was in his fourth season as head coach of his alma mater.\n\nMichigan began the year ranked 14th in both the [[AP Poll]] and [[Coaches Poll]]. Their first game of the year was on the road against [[Michigan\u2013Notre Dame football rivalry|rival]] [[2018 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]], the first meeting between the two schools since 2014. The Wolverines lost that game, 24\u201317. Michigan won their next ten games, however, including wins over then-ranked Big Ten opponents [[2018 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]], [[2018 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], and [[2018 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], all of whom beat Michigan the previous year.

The revenge tour came to an abrupt end, as Michigan lost, 62\u201339, their seventh consecutive loss to the Buckeyes and 14th loss in 15 years in the series. The Wolverines were selected to their second [[New Year's Six]] bowl in three years, the [[2018 Peach Bowl (December)|Peach Bowl]], where they lost to [[2018 Florida Gators football team|Florida]], 41\u201315. The team's final record was 10\u20133, Harbaugh's third ten-win season in four years, and the team finished exactly where they started in the polls, at 14th.\n\nMichigan was led on offense by junior quarterback [[Shea Patterson]], a transfer from [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]], and running back [[Karan Higdon]], who became the first Michigan running back to rush for 1,000 yards since [[Fitzgerald Toussaint]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/wolverines/index.ssf/2018/11/michigan_rb_karan_higdon_hits.html|title=Michigan RB Karan Higdon hits 1,000 yards rushing|first=Aaron|last=McCann|website=MLive.com|date=November 10, 2018}}</ref> On defense, the Wolverines were led by linebacker [[Devin Bush Jr.]], who was a [[2018 College Football All-America Team|consensus All-American]] and won the [[Big Ten Conference football individual awards#Nagurski\u2013Woodson Defensive Player of the Year|Nagurski\u2013Woodson Award]] as the Big Ten's defensive player of the year.

The Wolverines were members of the East Division of the [[Big Ten Conference]] and played their home games at [[Michigan Stadium]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. Michigan was coached by [[Jim Harbaugh]], who was in his fourth season as head coach of his alma mater.\n\nMichigan began the year ranked 14th in both the [[AP Poll]] and [[Coaches Poll]]. Their first game of the year was on the road against [[Michigan\u2013Notre Dame football rivalry|rival]] [[2018 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]], the first meeting between the two schools since 2014. The Wolverines lost that game, 24\u201317. Michigan won their next ten games, however, including wins over then-ranked Big Ten opponents [[2018 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]], [[2018 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], and [[2018 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], all of whom beat Michigan the previous year.

The revenge tour came to an abrupt end, as Michigan lost, 62\u201339, their seventh consecutive loss to the Buckeyes and 14th loss in 15 years in the series. The Wolverines were selected to their second [[New Year's Six]] bowl in three years, the [[2018 Peach Bowl (December)|Peach Bowl]], where they lost to [[2018 Florida Gators football team|Florida]], 41\u201315. The team's final record was 10\u20133, Harbaugh's third ten-win season in four years, and the team finished exactly where they started in the polls, at 14th.\n\nMichigan was led on offense by junior quarterback [[Shea Patterson]], a transfer from [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]], and running back [[Karan Higdon]], who became the first Michigan running back to rush for 1,000 yards since [[Fitzgerald Toussaint]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/wolverines/index.ssf/2018/11/michigan_rb_karan_higdon_hits.html|title=Michigan RB Karan Higdon hits 1,000 yards rushing|first=Aaron|last=McCann|website=MLive.com|date=November 10, 2018}}</ref> On defense, the Wolverines were led by linebacker [[Devin Bush Jr.]], who was a [[2018 College Football All-America Team|consensus All-American]] and won the [[Big Ten Conference football individual awards#Nagurski\u2013Woodson Defensive Player of the Year|Nagurski\u2013Woodson Award]] as the Big Ten's defensive player of the year.

The company, which leveraged technological innovations and [[Mathematical finance|quantitative models]], was one of the world's premier [[Market maker|market-making firms]], trading on 28 [[Financial markets|exchanges]] in nine countries. Hull went on to found Hull Investments, LLC in 1999 which serves as a family office for three generations of the Hull family, and acts as parent company to a number of financial entities.  In 2009, Hull founded Ketchum Trading, LLC, a [[proprietary trading]] firm that traded and provided liquidity in [[futures exchange|futures]], [[option (finance)|options]], cash equities and [[exchange-traded fund]]s.  And in 2013, Hull created Hull Tactical Asset Allocation, LLC.  HTAA operates an actively managed ETF and utilizes advanced algorithms as well as macro and technical indicators to anticipate future market returns.\n\n[[Trader Monthly]] recognized him for having executed one of \"The 40 Greatest Trades of All Time\" and [[Worth (magazine)|Worth Magazine]] named him one of \"Wall Street\u2019s 25 Smartest Players.\"  Hull has also been honored by The Options Industry Council as the 2014 recipient of the Joseph W. Sullivan Options Industry Achievement Award\" in recognition of his outstanding lifetime contributions to the growth and integrity of the U.S. options market.<ref>[http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/9/d/5/9d57634c6da15ecb/OIC2014SullivanAward.mp3?c_id=7202965&expiration=1420478159&hwt=8281145cd53b8992be09f28d5c16b52e]{{dead link|date=August 2018}}</ref>\n\nA longtime political activist and donor, Blair Hull sought the [[Democratic Party of Illinois|Illinois Democratic Party]]\u2019s nomination as candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2004 as a champion of [[universal healthcare]] and [[efficiency]] in government. [[Barack Obama]] ultimately won that primary. Blair Hull remains active in the political arena as both an activist and donor.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\n===Early years===\nBlair Hull was born in 1942, the son of Marson Hull and Jean Matlock Hull, and raised in [[Los Gatos, California]]\u2014near what would later be called [[Silicon Valley]].  After completing high school, Hull went to work on the assembly line of a cannery factory to help support his family, ultimately joining [[Trade Union|Union]] Local 679 and earning himself a union card by the age of 19.\n\nDuring the Vietnam buildup, Hull served six years in the [[United States Army]]. After reaching the rank of lieutenant and completing his military service, Blair Hull turned to the classroom, teaching high school level math and physics before becoming a student again himself and going on to higher education with the [[GI Bill]], as his father had done before him.\n\nHe earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics<ref>https://giving.ucsb.edu/Recognition/hull-feminist-studies</ref> from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], his MBA<ref>https://web.archive.org/save/https://magazine.scu.edu/classnote/blair-hull/</ref> from [[Santa Clara University]] and graduated from the Harvard ''Owner/President Management'' Program.<ref>https://www.exed.hbs.edu/owner-president-management/</ref>\n\nWhile working full-time at a manufacturing company, Hull tested his mathematical and analytical skills at the [[blackjack]] tables in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], where he proved to be a skilled and disciplined player. Hull took his accumulated winnings to the [[Pacific Stock Exchange]], then to the Chicago financial exchanges. Once there, he established himself as a pioneer in the trading industry, revolutionizing the financial markets through the use of innovative models and state-of-the-art technology.\n\nAs Founder of Hull Trading Company, Blair Hull built a business from scratch in Illinois, created hundreds of jobs, and grew his company into one of the most successful trading firms in the country.\n\n===Beating the Odds===\nTrained in mathematics and computer science, Hull applied his skills to the Las Vegas blackjack tables in the 1970s. He beat the odds\u2014or, rather, beat the house by shifting the odds in his favor\u2014by devising intricate mathematical formulas that called for a skilled team of card players to help determine when and how to bet in blackjack. The team consistently turned a profit. Their story is outlined in the book ''The Big Player'' by Ken Uston.\n\t\n:::\"When Hull played blackjack, he saw it not as a risk-taking endeavor but rather \u201ca clear financial opportunity that other people did not see.\u201d With the right system, blackjack became a positive-expectation game: Statistically speaking, Hull had to win (over the long haul at least). Similarly, he would have been loath to enter the options market without what he perceived as an advantage. At the Pacific Exchange, Hull\u2019s equivalent to card counting was the exploitation of his computer-generated theoretical-value sheets. Based on an option-pricing model of Hull\u2019s own invention (similar to the Black\u2013Scholes model, though he was unaware of their work at the time), the sheets told him what each option was truly worth at a particular stock price\u2014and he would buy or sell accordingly to exploit the spread. The system worked.\" \u2013''MBA Jungle''\n\nHull left the blackjack tables with $25,000 and took his winnings to the markets\u2014first leasing a seat on the Pacific Stock Exchange, then starting a firm on the Chicago financial exchanges.\n\n==Business career==\n\n===Hull Trading Company===\n* [[Hull Trading Company]] 1985\u20131999\nBlair Hull founded [[Hull Trading Company]] in 1985 and served as the firm's chairman and CEO.\n\nThe company was a global leader in the application of computer technology to listed [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] trading.  Hull developed a proprietary and large scale reliable distributed system architecture, providing automatic real-time pricing, risk management, market making and interconnection with automated options, futures and stock exchanges as they became available.  Hull's massively scalable [[software technology]] was deployed to cover both domestic and international markets as electronic, on-line exchanges became available, while innovative hand-held computer technology was employed at exchanges still requiring execution by floor traders.\n\n:::\"The trading room at Hull headquarters looks like NASA mission control. Powerful workstations process streams of financial data, flashing advice to the handhelds carried by Hull traders at the CBOE and the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] (CBOT).  Different workstations track the firm's risk profile, sending handheld-equipped traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange instructions about how to use futures contracts to hedge trades being made at the CBOE and the CBOT.\n:::The goal of this remarkable technological firepower is simple: not to take big risks but to find sure things. Hull's computers search the markets for temporary price imperfections, devise transactions to profit from the imperfections, and hedge those bets to protect against other risks.  It's a lot like blackjack. \"All you need is a mathematical advantage and the controls to ensure that you stay in the game,\" Hull argues. \"Everything else takes care of itself.\" \u2013''Fast Company''\n\nThe firm grew to over 250 employees including financial engineers, [[physicist]]s, almost 100 software engineers and computer support staff. At its peak, Hull Trading Company moved nearly a quarter of the entire daily market volume on some markets, executed over 7% of the index options traded in the United States, 3% of the equity options, and 1% of all shares traded daily on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].\n:::\"His computers trade stocks faster than the human eye can see them scroll on a screen. The system is designed to predict patterns that will unfold in the market over periods as short as two minutes.  In a business that isn't normally modest about its technological savvy, Hull and his automated trading shop are the envy of Wall Street's top firms.\" \u2013 ''Worth Magazine''\n\nIn 1999, Blair Hull sold his company to [[Goldman Sachs]] for $531 million.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Hull Investments, LLC===\n* Hull Investments, LLC 1999\u2013Current\nHull Investments, LLC was founded in 1999 following the sale of Hull Trading Group to Goldman Sachs for $531 million.

(born September 3, 1942) is an American businessman, investor, Democratic politician, and philanthropist.\n\nHull founded [[Hull Trading Company]] in 1985 and served as the firm's Chairman and chief executive officer before selling it to [[Goldman Sachs]] in 1999 for $531 million. The company, which leveraged technological innovations and [[Mathematical finance|quantitative models]], was one of the world's premier [[Market maker|market-making firms]], trading on 28 [[Financial markets|exchanges]] in nine countries. Hull went on to found Hull Investments, LLC in 1999 which serves as a family office for three generations of the Hull family, and acts as parent company to a number of financial entities.  In 2009, Hull founded Ketchum Trading, LLC, a [[proprietary trading]] firm that traded and provided liquidity in [[futures exchange|futures]], [[option (finance)|options]], cash equities and [[exchange-traded fund]]s.  And in 2013, Hull created Hull Tactical Asset Allocation, LLC.  HTAA operates an actively managed ETF and utilizes advanced algorithms as well as macro and technical indicators to anticipate future market returns.\n\n[[Trader Monthly]] recognized him for having executed one of \"The 40 Greatest Trades of All Time\" and [[Worth (magazine)|Worth Magazine]] named him one of \"Wall Street\u2019s 25 Smartest Players.\"  Hull has also been honored by The Options Industry Council as the 2014 recipient of the Joseph W. Sullivan Options Industry Achievement Award\" in recognition of his outstanding lifetime contributions to the growth and integrity of the U.S. options market.<ref>[http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/9/d/5/9d57634c6da15ecb/OIC2014SullivanAward.mp3?c_id=7202965&expiration=1420478159&hwt=8281145cd53b8992be09f28d5c16b52e]{{dead link|date=August 2018}}</ref>\n\nA longtime political activist and donor, Blair Hull sought the [[Democratic Party of Illinois|Illinois Democratic Party]]\u2019s nomination as candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2004 as a champion of [[universal healthcare]] and [[efficiency]] in government. [[Barack Obama]] ultimately won that primary. Blair Hull remains active in the political arena as both an activist and donor.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\n===Early years===\nBlair Hull was born in 1942, the son of Marson Hull and Jean Matlock Hull, and raised in [[Los Gatos, California]]\u2014near what would later be called [[Silicon Valley]].  After completing high school, Hull went to work on the assembly line of a cannery factory to help support his family, ultimately joining [[Trade Union|Union]] Local 679 and earning himself a union card by the age of 19.\n\nDuring the Vietnam buildup, Hull served six years in the [[United States Army]]. After reaching the rank of lieutenant and completing his military service, Blair Hull turned to the classroom, teaching high school level math and physics before becoming a student again himself and going on to higher education with the [[GI Bill]], as his father had done before him.\n\nHe earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics<ref>https://giving.ucsb.edu/Recognition/hull-feminist-studies</ref> from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], his MBA<ref>https://web.archive.org/save/https://magazine.scu.edu/classnote/blair-hull/</ref> from [[Santa Clara University]] and graduated from the Harvard ''Owner/President Management'' Program.<ref>https://www.exed.hbs.edu/owner-president-management/</ref>\n\nWhile working full-time at a manufacturing company, Hull tested his mathematical and analytical skills at the [[blackjack]] tables in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], where he proved to be a skilled and disciplined player. Hull took his accumulated winnings to the [[Pacific Stock Exchange]], then to the Chicago financial exchanges. Once there, he established himself as a pioneer in the trading industry, revolutionizing the financial markets through the use of innovative models and state-of-the-art technology.\n\nAs Founder of Hull Trading Company, Blair Hull built a business from scratch in Illinois, created hundreds of jobs, and grew his company into one of the most successful trading firms in the country.\n\n===Beating the Odds===\nTrained in mathematics and computer science, Hull applied his skills to the Las Vegas blackjack tables in the 1970s. He beat the odds\u2014or, rather, beat the house by shifting the odds in his favor\u2014by devising intricate mathematical formulas that called for a skilled team of card players to help determine when and how to bet in blackjack. The team consistently turned a profit. Their story is outlined in the book ''The Big Player'' by Ken Uston.\n\t\n:::\"When Hull played blackjack, he saw it not as a risk-taking endeavor but rather \u201ca clear financial opportunity that other people did not see.\u201d With the right system, blackjack became a positive-expectation game: Statistically speaking, Hull had to win (over the long haul at least). Similarly, he would have been loath to enter the options market without what he perceived as an advantage. At the Pacific Exchange, Hull\u2019s equivalent to card counting was the exploitation of his computer-generated theoretical-value sheets. Based on an option-pricing model of Hull\u2019s own invention (similar to the Black\u2013Scholes model, though he was unaware of their work at the time), the sheets told him what each option was truly worth at a particular stock price\u2014and he would buy or sell accordingly to exploit the spread. The system worked.\" \u2013''MBA Jungle''\n\nHull left the blackjack tables with $25,000 and took his winnings to the markets\u2014first leasing a seat on the Pacific Stock Exchange, then starting a firm on the Chicago financial exchanges.\n\n==Business career==\n\n===Hull Trading Company===\n* [[Hull Trading Company]] 1985\u20131999\nBlair Hull founded [[Hull Trading Company]] in 1985 and served as the firm's chairman and CEO.\n\nThe company was a global leader in the application of computer technology to listed [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]] trading.  Hull developed a proprietary and large scale reliable distributed system architecture, providing automatic real-time pricing, risk management, market making and interconnection with automated options, futures and stock exchanges as they became available.  Hull's massively scalable [[software technology]] was deployed to cover both domestic and international markets as electronic, on-line exchanges became available, while innovative hand-held computer technology was employed at exchanges still requiring execution by floor traders.\n\n:::\"The trading room at Hull headquarters looks like NASA mission control. Powerful workstations process streams of financial data, flashing advice to the handhelds carried by Hull traders at the CBOE and the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] (CBOT).  Different workstations track the firm's risk profile, sending handheld-equipped traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange instructions about how to use futures contracts to hedge trades being made at the CBOE and the CBOT.\n:::The goal of this remarkable technological firepower is simple: not to take big risks but to find sure things. Hull's computers search the markets for temporary price imperfections, devise transactions to profit from the imperfections, and hedge those bets to protect against other risks.  It's a lot like blackjack. \"All you need is a mathematical advantage and the controls to ensure that you stay in the game,\" Hull argues. \"Everything else takes care of itself.\" \u2013''Fast Company''\n\nThe firm grew to over 250 employees including financial engineers, [[physicist]]s, almost 100 software engineers and computer support staff. At its peak, Hull Trading Company moved nearly a quarter of the entire daily market volume on some markets, executed over 7% of the index options traded in the United States, 3% of the equity options, and 1% of all shares traded daily on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].\n:::\"His computers trade stocks faster than the human eye can see them scroll on a screen. The system is designed to predict patterns that will unfold in the market over periods as short as two minutes.  In a business that isn't normally modest about its technological savvy, Hull and his automated trading shop are the envy of Wall Street's top firms.\" \u2013 ''Worth Magazine''\n\nIn 1999, Blair Hull sold his company to [[Goldman Sachs]] for $531 million.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Hull Investments, LLC===\n* Hull Investments, LLC 1999\u2013Current\nHull Investments, LLC was founded in 1999 following the sale of Hull Trading Group to Goldman Sachs for $531 million.

Macdonald also provided funds for the initial expenses of equipment, as well as an annual endowment for their maintenance. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms in the northern half of the top floor of the old Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of George Taylor Hyde, Norman M.

By 1906, he was teaching six classes, so he hired three new staff to assist him, including his former colleague [[Cecil Burgess]].

Macdonald also provided funds for the initial expenses of equipment, as well as an annual endowment for their maintenance. At this time, the School had two architecture studios which occupied two rooms in the northern half of the top floor of the old Macdonald Engineering Building. The School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation, and as it remains today, the first year was preparatory, with all courses taken jointly by architecture and engineering students. The first graduating class was composed of only three students,{{NoteTag|The first graduating class was composed of George Taylor Hyde, Norman M.
