It has preserved much [[Old Frisian]] pronunciation and vocabulary. It is still spoken by some 300 people in Hindeloopen, almost all of them elderly, and that number is decreasing.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nHindeloopen Frisian has been written since the 17th century. In 1981, the [[Fryske Akademy]] (Frisian Academy) published a dictionary of the language, then still seen as a [[dialect]] (Hylper Wurdboek, 1981, author: Gosse Blom). In 2006 they started developing a new dicionary which was completed in 2019 (Graet Hylper Wordebook, authors: Gosse Blom, Sybren Dyk, assisted by Wiebe Zoethout). This dictionary contains 1000 pages of words, grammar and synonyms and is considered the definitive version of the language. <ref>[https://frieschdagblad.nl/2019/3/23/graet-hylper-wordebook-hoe-taal-het-leven-spiegelt \"Graet Hylper Wordebook: Hoe taal het leven spiegelt\"] Dutch, Friesch Dagblad, 23 maart 2019</ref>  \n\nIn 2019 Hylpers was internationally recognized as a language when [[Glottolog]], an international scientific online database containing a comprehensive catalogue of more than 7000 of the the world's languages, language families and dialects, added it into their database. The language is stored under \"Language: Hindeloopen-Molkwerum Frisian\" using the Glottocode \"hind1237\". Molkwerums (dead language) and Hindeloopers/Hylpers are seen as a unit. <ref>[https://www.trouw.nl/cs-bf99e210 \"Spreekt u al Aasters, Schiermonnikoogs of Hielpes? Dankzij Dyami Millarson (25) zijn het nu zelfstandige talen\"] Dutch, Trouw, 2 juni 2019</ref>\n\nGlottolog is part of the [[Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History]] in Jena (Germany)\n\nThe Hylper language is still being taught at the local elementary School.\n\n==Development==\nDue to its position on a peninsula, Hindeloopen was very isolated from the mainland until the 20th century and for centuries had more contact with the coastal cities in [[Holland]] on the other side of the South Sea. Because of this, Hindeloopen Frisian underwent greater influence from Hollandic speech than the other dialects of West Frisian.

The dialect\u2019s vocabulary preserves many more words from Old Frisian that are no longer used elsewhere.\nThe differences in pronunciation and vocabulary between Hindeloopen Frisian and Standard West Frisian are so big that mutual intelligibility is difficult.

It has preserved much [[Old Frisian]] pronunciation and vocabulary. It is still spoken by some 300 people in Hindeloopen, almost all of them elderly, and that number is decreasing.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\nHindeloopen Frisian has been written since the 17th century. In 1981, the [[Fryske Akademy]] (Frisian Academy) published a dictionary of the language, then still seen as a dialect (Hylper Wurdboek, 1981, author: Gosse Blom). In 2006 they started developing a new dicionary which was completed in 2019 (Graet Hylper Wordebook, authors: Gosse Blom, Sybren Dyk, assisted by Wiebe Zoethout). This dictionary contains 1000 pages of words, grammar and synonyms and is considered the definitive version of the language. <ref>[https://frieschdagblad.nl/2019/3/23/graet-hylper-wordebook-hoe-taal-het-leven-spiegelt \"Graet Hylper Wordebook: Hoe taal het leven spiegelt\"] Dutch, Friesch Dagblad, 23 maart 2019</ref>  \n\nIn 2019 Hylpers was internationally recognized as a language when [[Glottolog]], an international scientific online database containing a comprehensive catalogue of more than 7000 of the the world's languages, language families and dialects, added it into their database. The language is stored under \"Language: Hindeloopen-Molkwerum Frisian\" using the Glottocode \"hind1237\". Molkwerums (dead language) and Hindeloopers/Hylpers are seen as a unit. <ref>[https://www.trouw.nl/cs-bf99e210 \"Spreekt u al Aasters, Schiermonnikoogs of Hielpes?

Because of this, Hindeloopen Frisian underwent greater influence from Hollandic speech than the other dialects of West Frisian.

It allows EEA citizens and their family members to live and work in the UK without explicit permission.  Although Swiss citizens are covered by a separate [[Switzerland and the European Union|bilateral agreement]] they are treated basically the same as EEA nationals.

EEA Regulations !! Directive 2004/38 !! Meaning\n|-\n| [[European Economic Area Family Permit]]\n| visa\n| entry clearance for non-EEA citizens\n|-\n| extended family members\n| beneficiaries\n| other family members or dependants, partners in a durable relationship\n|}\n\n{| border=\"1\"\n|+ Applications\n!

A person outside of this definition (especially unmarried partners) may fall under the category extended family member.  These include dependents of the EU citizens, members of the household, and a partner in a \"durable relationship\".  While the Directive 2004/38 requires member states to \"facilitate entry\" for extended family members, the details are not defined.  The Directive does not seem to grant any rights to extended family members.\n\nIn the EEA Regulations, the acceptance of extended family members is not explicit. UK regulations have specific criteria for extended family members, including unmarried and same sex partners. Once an extended family member has been issued with an EEA family permit, Residence Card or Residence Certificate, they are regarded under UK regulations as family members.\n\n==Accession states==\n\nWorkers from recent member states have the right to move to the UK, but their access to the labour market is limited.  The details are defined in the [[Worker Registration Scheme]] (WRS).  Nationals of [[A8 countries]] will cease to be subject to the Worker Registration scheme and may benefit from free movement under the directive once 12 months employment with a single employer has been completed.  The transitional WRS scheme [[Freedom of movement for workers#Free movement rights of nationals of new member states|became obsolete in 2011]] when A8 national workers will have the same rights as all other EEA nationals.\n\n==Completeness==\n\nThe implementation is reasonably complete, although there are areas where the Directive has not been fully implemented. One example is a failure to correctly implement the [[Surinder Singh route|Surinder Singh]] ruling of the European Court of Justice.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yeo|first1=Colin|title=EU to investigate UK interpretation of Surinder Singh|url=https://www.freemovement.org.uk/eu-to-investigate-uk-interpretation-of-surinder-singh/|website=Free Movement: updates and commentary on immigration and asylum law|accessdate=20 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAnother issue with the UK implementation of the Directive is that the UK has kept national immigration law (the \"Immigration Rules\") separate from the implementation of the European law (the \"EEA Regulations\").  While it is possible to switch from the UK law to the European law, this does reset the clock for acquiring permanent residence.  The legal situation of extended family members during this switch is uncertain, because they have to conform to both laws.  Switching from European law to UK law is possible only after the EEA citizen became settled in the UK. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The EEA national is considered settled when having attained permanent residence.\n\n==Implementation issues==\n{{Multiple issues|section = y|\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2009}}\n{{essay-like|section|date=November 2009}}\n{{cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=November 2009}}\n}}\n\nBy far the biggest implementation issue is the long processing time for the issue of residence cards (EEA2 applications).  This can take 6 months or longer (current processing times as at January 2009 are up to a year according to the [http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/eucitizens/applyingundereuropeanlaw/ web site]).  During this time it is very difficult for the family member to start working, to open a bank account, to register with a doctor or to travel.  This issue is created and aggravated by a combination of several seemingly harmless infringements.  These infringements are:\n\n* The initial visa (EEA family permit) is valid for only 6 months (reduced in 2006 from previously 12 months).\n* The processing of the EEA2 application (which is required to be completed within 6 months) often takes longer than 6 months.\n* During this time the passport of both the EEA citizen and the family member is held by the Home Office.\n* While it is possible to request the passport back without cancelling the application, the [http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/contact/contactspage/contactcentres/ current web page] does not mention this (unlike the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070702084524/http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/applying/returnofpassports previous one]).\n\nAnd without the passport life can be difficult for a foreigner, because the passport is required in many situations.  Even if the passport is received back, family members often encounter difficulties because of the short validity of the EEA family permit.  For example, a GP may refuse to register the family member because the visa is not valid for another 6 months (which is not correct, but nevertheless common).\n\nMost of these problems are aggravated by the way that the certificate of application (the acknowledgment of the application) is issued.\n\n* The certificate of application (which is required to be issued immediately) is sent very slowly.\n* The certificate of application is a generic letter without reference to the concrete case.\n* The certificate of application does not grant the right to enter the UK.\n\nThe obvious solution would be issue a temporary visa with the right to work immediately, and to send the residence card once the application is completed.  A self-help option is to keep the passports and only include a copy in the application.  According to individual reports the Home Office will request the passport once the application is ready for processing, and then the residence card is issued reasonably quickly.\n\nThere are further issues, but they have a comparatively small effect.  The application forms (EEA1, EEA2, EEA3, EEA4, and VAF5) are overly complicated, ask for a good amount of unnecessary information, and ask for many more documents to be included than legally necessary under the directive.  For example, the application for a residence card as the family member of an EEA national requires that the EEA national's employer stamps the application form and provides a letter confirming the EEA national's employment. Until March 2009 applications launched by family members from outside of the EEA are judged against the national immigration rules despite the ECJ's ruling in [[Metock case]] that the imposition of a requirement for prior lawful residence is unlawful under EU law.  There are also issues for spouses that are separate but not yet divorced.\n\nIn May 2009 further regulations relating EEA applications were laid before parliament.  These regulations introduced proscribed forms for requests of EEA residence documentation.  The regulations allow the Home Office to decline to consider a request for residence documentation if the proscribed form is incorrectly completed or the individual requests documentation without using an application form.  This move has brought criticism from immigration law practitioners who argue that the imposition of a proscribed form is unlawful under Directive 2004/38.\n\nIt is possible to enter the UK even without an EEA Family Permit, using an article 10 residence card,<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/entering-the-uk-as-the-holder-of-an-article-10-residence-card/entering-the-uk-as-the-holder-of-an-article-10-residence-card</ref> but immigration officers are often not aware of this option, and personal reports are discouraging.\n\nCommunicating with the Home Office is usually difficult.  The advice given on the web page is also often inconclusive, incomplete or leaving out essential rights of the applicant (see [http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/eucitizens/applyingundereuropeanlaw/ applying]).  Written requests for an update as to the progress of an application are met with a stock response indicating that the priority of the Home Office lies with the removal of foreign nationals.\n\nhttps://www.penningtonslaw.com/news-publications/latest-news/amendments-to-the-immigration-(european-economic-area)-regulations-2006==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080917223352/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20061003.htm Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006] \u2014 UK Government\n*[http://www.eearegulations.co.uk/Archive/V20161125 Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations Latest Consolidated Version] \u2014 EEARegulations.co.uk\n*[http://prado.consilium.europa.eu/EN/2616/viewImage_61252.html Image ] of an EEA Registration Certificate (pre 2011), the Residence Card looks the same but with different text.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eea Regulations (Uk)}}\n[[Category:European Union law]]\n[[Category:Schengen, Luxembourg]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement in Europe]]\n[[Category:Boundary treaties]]\n[[Category:Borders of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:International transport]]\n[[Category:Immigration law in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:2006 in British law]]\n[[Category:Immigration to the European Union]]\n[[Category:European Economic Area]]\n[[Category:Visa policy of the United Kingdom]]\nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1003/contents/made\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=March 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013}}\nThe Immigration ([[European Economic Area]]) Regulations 2006 <ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1003/introduction/made\n|title=Statutory Instrument 2006 No. 1003 \u2013 The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006\n|date=30 April 2006\n|accessdate=2008-12-17\n}}</ref> (or ''EEA Regulations'' for short) amended by SI 2009/1117,<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/1117/introduction/made\n|title=Statutory Instruments 2009 No. 1117 \u2013 The Immigration (European Economic Area) (Amendment) Regulations 2009\n|date=1 June 2009\n|accessdate=2009-09-14\n}}</ref> SI 2011/1247<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/1247/introduction/made\n|title=Statutory Instruments 2011 No. 1247 \u2013 The Immigration (European Economic Area) (Amendment) Regulations 2011\n|date=2 June 2011\n|accessdate=2011-05-25\n}}</ref> and SI 2015/694 <ref>Immigration Media, [http://www.immigration.media/what-do-the-2015-eea-regulations-do/ \"What do the 2015 EEA Regulations do?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427145208/http://www.immigration.media/what-do-the-2015-eea-regulations-do/ |date=27 April 2015 }}, \"Immigration Media\", 20 April 2015</ref> which have now been mostly repealed and superseded by the [[Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016]] was a piece of British legislation which implemented the right of free movement of EEA nationals and their family members in the United Kingdom.

Switching from European law to UK law is possible only after the EEA citizen became settled in the UK. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The EEA national is considered settled when having attained permanent residence.\n\n==Implementation issues==\n{{Multiple issues|section = y|\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2009}}\n{{essay-like|section|date=November 2009}}\n{{cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=November 2009}}\n}}\n\nBy far the biggest implementation issue is the long processing time for the issue of residence cards (EEA2 applications).  This can take 6 months or longer (current processing times as at January 2009 are up to a year according to the [http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/eucitizens/applyingundereuropeanlaw/ web site]).  During this time it is very difficult for the family member to start working, to open a bank account, to register with a doctor or to travel.  This issue is created and aggravated by a combination of several seemingly harmless infringements.  These infringements are:\n\n* The initial visa (EEA family permit) is valid for only 6 months (reduced in 2006 from previously 12 months).\n* The processing of the EEA2 application (which is required to be completed within 6 months) often takes longer than 6 months.\n* During this time the passport of both the EEA citizen and the family member is held by the Home Office.\n* While it is possible to request the passport back without cancelling the application, the [http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/contact/contactspage/contactcentres/ current web page] does not mention this (unlike the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070702084524/http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/applying/returnofpassports previous one]).\n\nAnd without the passport life can be difficult for a foreigner, because the passport is required in many situations.  Even if the passport is received back, family members often encounter difficulties because of the short validity of the EEA family permit.  For example, a GP may refuse to register the family member because the visa is not valid for another 6 months (which is not correct, but nevertheless common).\n\nMost of these problems are aggravated by the way that the certificate of application (the acknowledgment of the application) is issued.\n\n* The certificate of application (which is required to be issued immediately) is sent very slowly.\n* The certificate of application is a generic letter without reference to the concrete case.\n* The certificate of application does not grant the right to enter the UK.\n\nThe obvious solution would be issue a temporary visa with the right to work immediately, and to send the residence card once the application is completed.  A self-help option is to keep the passports and only include a copy in the application.  According to individual reports the Home Office will request the passport once the application is ready for processing, and then the residence card is issued reasonably quickly.\n\nThere are further issues, but they have a comparatively small effect.  The application forms (EEA1, EEA2, EEA3, EEA4, and VAF5) are overly complicated, ask for a good amount of unnecessary information, and ask for many more documents to be included than legally necessary under the directive.  For example, the application for a residence card as the family member of an EEA national requires that the EEA national's employer stamps the application form and provides a letter confirming the EEA national's employment. Until March 2009 applications launched by family members from outside of the EEA are judged against the national immigration rules despite the ECJ's ruling in [[Metock case]] that the imposition of a requirement for prior lawful residence is unlawful under EU law.  There are also issues for spouses that are separate but not yet divorced.\n\nIn May 2009 further regulations relating EEA applications were laid before parliament.  These regulations introduced proscribed forms for requests of EEA residence documentation.  The regulations allow the Home Office to decline to consider a request for residence documentation if the proscribed form is incorrectly completed or the individual requests documentation without using an application form.  This move has brought criticism from immigration law practitioners who argue that the imposition of a proscribed form is unlawful under Directive 2004/38.\n\nIt is possible to enter the UK even without an EEA Family Permit, using an article 10 residence card,<ref>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/entering-the-uk-as-the-holder-of-an-article-10-residence-card/entering-the-uk-as-the-holder-of-an-article-10-residence-card</ref> but immigration officers are often not aware of this option, and personal reports are discouraging.\n\nCommunicating with the Home Office is usually difficult.  The advice given on the web page is also often inconclusive, incomplete or leaving out essential rights of the applicant (see [http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/eucitizens/applyingundereuropeanlaw/ applying]).  Written requests for an update as to the progress of an application are met with a stock response indicating that the priority of the Home Office lies with the removal of foreign nationals.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080917223352/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2006/20061003.htm Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006] \u2014 UK Government\n*[http://www.eearegulations.co.uk/Archive/V20161125 Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations Latest Consolidated Version] \u2014 EEARegulations.co.uk\n*[http://prado.consilium.europa.eu/EN/2616/viewImage_61252.html Image ] of an EEA Registration Certificate (pre 2011), the Residence Card looks the same but with different text.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eea Regulations (Uk)}}\n[[Category:European Union law]]\n[[Category:Schengen, Luxembourg]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement in Europe]]\n[[Category:Boundary treaties]]\n[[Category:Borders of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:International transport]]\n[[Category:Immigration law in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Statutory Instruments of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:2006 in British law]]\n[[Category:Immigration to the European Union]]\n[[Category:European Economic Area]]\n[[Category:Visa policy of the United Kingdom]]\nhttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2006/1003/contents/made\n", "name_user": "Kelsey.QY.Dong", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_(European_Economic_Area)_Regulations_2006"}

The image that we have of her is mainly based on Anne's critical view. 'Hello everyone I'm amazing'is in Anne franks diary.  \n\nShe attended the Ludwig-Richter School in Frankfurt until the appointment of [[Adolf Hitler]] on January 30, 1933, to the position of [[chancellor]] in [[Germany]] brought an increase of anti-Jewish measures, among which was the expulsion of Jewish schoolchildren from non-denominational schools. In response to the rising tide of [[anti-semitism]], the family decided to follow the 63,000 other Jews who had left Germany that year and immigrate to [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]]. Edith Frank-Holl\u00e4nder and her daughters moved in with her mother in [[Aachen]] in June 1933 until Otto Frank found accommodation in [[Amsterdam]]. Margot and her mother left Germany to join him on December 5, 1933, followed by Anne in February 1934. Margot was enrolled in an elementary school on Amsterdam's Jekerstraat, close to their new address in Amsterdam South. Despite initial problems with the Dutch language, Margot became a star pupil.  She achieved excellent academic results until an anti-Jewish law imposed a year after the 1940 [[Military history of the Netherlands during World War II|German invasion of the Netherlands]] demanded her removal to a Jewish [[lyceum]]. There she displayed the studiousness and intelligence which had made her noteworthy at her previous schools and was remembered by former pupils as virtuous, reserved, and very obedient. Margot had a large circle of friends and enjoyed rowing and playing tennis in her spare time. In her diary, Anne recounted instances of their mother suggesting she emulate Margot, and although she wrote of admiring her sister in some respects for being handsome and clever, Anne sought to define her own individuality without role models. Margot is also shown to have a much better relationship with at least her mother, and had a much more modest and tolerant nature as opposed to Anne, who was determined and often spoke her mind.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nWhile Anne inherited her father's ambivalence towards the [[Torah]], Margot followed her mother's example and became involved in Amsterdam's Jewish community. She took [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] classes, attended [[synagogue]], and in 1941 joined a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Zionism|Zionist]] club for young people who wanted to immigrate to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] to found a Jewish state, where, according to Anne, she wished to become a [[midwife]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn July 5, 1942, she received a notice to report to a labor camp and the next day went into hiding with her family in a secret annex of a house. They were later joined by four other Jewish refugees and remained hidden for two years until they were betrayed on August 4, 1944.<ref name=critical_edition>{{cite book|editor1-first=David|editor1-last=Barnouw|editor2-first=Gerrold|editor2-last=Van Der Stroom|title=The Diary of Anne Frank: The Revised Critical Edition|year=2003|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=0-385-50847-6|page=21}}</ref>\n\n[[File:MargotFrankStolpersteinAachen 8224.jpg|thumb|[[Stolperstein]] for Margot Frank at the Pastorplatz in Aachen, Germany]]\n\n==Arrest And Death==\nAlong with the other occupants of the hiding place, Margot Frank was arrested by the Gestapo on 4 August 1944, and detained in their headquarters overnight before being taken to a cell in a nearby prison for three days. From here they were taken by train, on 8 August, to the Dutch [[Westerbork concentration camp]]. As the Frank family had failed to respond to Margot's call-up notice in 1942 and had been discovered in hiding, they (along with [[Fritz Pfeffer]] and the Van Pels family) were declared criminals by the camp's officials and detained in its punishment block to be sentenced to hard labor in the battery dismantling plant. They remained there until they were selected for Westerbork's last deportation to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] on September 3, 1944. Margot and Anne were transferred to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on October 30, where both contracted [[typhus]] in the winter of 1944.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nMargot Frank died March 27,1945 at the age of 19 due to [[typhus]]. A few days later, Anne died due to the same illness. [[Janny Brandes-Brilleslijper]] and her sister Lientje buried them together in one of the camp's mass graves; in August 1945, once she came back to the [[Netherlands]] and recovered from typhus, Janny wrote to Otto Frank and informed him that both of his daughters had died.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} \n\nOtto Frank was the only one to survive out of the eight people who went into hiding. When he returned to Amsterdam he was given Anne's diary by [[Miep Gies]], which he later published as a remembrance to her. Along with Anne, Margot Frank also wrote a diary during their time in hiding (Anne mentioned her sister's diary in her own) but Margot's diary was never found.<ref>{{cite web|title=Margot Frank|publisher=Anne Frank Stichting|url=http://www.annefrank.org/en/Anne-Frank/All-people/Margot-Frank/|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref> However, many authors wrote fan-based diaries of Margot such as the novel ''The Silent Sister'' by Mazal Alouf-Mizrahi.

The image that we have of her is mainly based on Anne's critical view. \n\nShe attended the Ludwig-Richter School in Frankfurt until the appointment of [[Adolf Hitler]] on January 30, 1933, to the position of [[chancellor]] in [[Germany]] brought an increase of anti-Jewish measures, among which was the expulsion of Jewish schoolchildren from non-denominational schools. In response to the rising tide of [[anti-semitism]], the family decided to follow the 63,000 other Jews who had left Germany that year and immigrate to [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]]. Edith Frank-Holl\u00e4nder and her daughters moved in with her mother in [[Aachen]] in June 1933 until Otto Frank found accommodation in [[Amsterdam]]. Margot and her mother left Germany to join him on December 5, 1933, followed by Anne in February 1934. Margot was enrolled in an elementary school on Amsterdam's Jekerstraat, close to their new address in Amsterdam South. Despite initial problems with the Dutch language, Margot became a star pupil.  She achieved excellent academic results until an anti-Jewish law imposed a year after the 1940 [[Military history of the Netherlands during World War II|German invasion of the Netherlands]] demanded her removal to a Jewish [[lyceum]]. There she displayed the studiousness and intelligence which had made her noteworthy at her previous schools and was remembered by former pupils as virtuous, reserved, and very obedient. Margot had a large circle of friends and enjoyed rowing and playing tennis in her spare time. In her diary, Anne recounted instances of their mother suggesting she emulate Margot, and although she wrote of admiring her sister in some respects for being handsome and clever, Anne sought to define her own individuality without role models. Margot is also shown to have a much better relationship with at least her mother, and had a much more modest and tolerant nature as opposed to Anne, who was determined and often spoke her mind.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nWhile Anne inherited her father's ambivalence towards the [[Torah]], Margot followed her mother's example and became involved in Amsterdam's Jewish community. She took [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] classes, attended [[synagogue]], and in 1941 joined a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Zionism|Zionist]] club for young people who wanted to immigrate to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] to found a Jewish state, where, according to Anne, she wished to become a [[midwife]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn July 5, 1942, she received a notice to report to a labor camp and the next day went into hiding with her family in a secret annex of a house. They were later joined by four other Jewish refugees and remained hidden for two years until they were betrayed on August 4, 1944.<ref name=critical_edition>{{cite book|editor1-first=David|editor1-last=Barnouw|editor2-first=Gerrold|editor2-last=Van Der Stroom|title=The Diary of Anne Frank: The Revised Critical Edition|year=2003|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=0-385-50847-6|page=21}}</ref>\n\n[[File:MargotFrankStolpersteinAachen 8224.jpg|thumb|[[Stolperstein]] for Margot Frank at the Pastorplatz in Aachen, Germany]]\n\n==Arrest And Death==\nAlong with the other occupants of the hiding place, Margot Frank was arrested by the Gestapo on 4 August 1944, and detained in their headquarters overnight before being taken to a cell in a nearby prison for three days. From here they were taken by train, on 8 August, to the Dutch [[Westerbork concentration camp]]. As the Frank family had failed to respond to Margot's call-up notice in 1942 and had been discovered in hiding, they (along with [[Fritz Pfeffer]] and the Van Pels family) were declared criminals by the camp's officials and detained in its punishment block to be sentenced to hard labor in the battery dismantling plant. They remained there until they were selected for Westerbork's last deportation to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] on September 3, 1944. Margot and Anne were transferred to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on October 30, where both contracted [[typhus]] in the winter of 1944.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nMargot Frank died March 27,1945 at the age of 19 due to [[typhus]]. A few days later, Anne died due to the same illness. [[Janny Brandes-Brilleslijper]] and her sister Lientje buried them together in one of the camp's mass graves; in August 1945, once she came back to the [[Netherlands]] and recovered from typhus, Janny wrote to Otto Frank and informed him that both of his daughters had died.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} \n\nOtto Frank was the only one to survive out of the eight people who went into hiding. When he returned to Amsterdam he was given Anne's diary by [[Miep Gies]], which he later published as a remembrance to her. Along with Anne, Margot Frank also wrote a diary during their time in hiding (Anne mentioned her sister's diary in her own) but Margot's diary was never found.<ref>{{cite web|title=Margot Frank|publisher=Anne Frank Stichting|url=http://www.annefrank.org/en/Anne-Frank/All-people/Margot-Frank/|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref> However, many authors wrote fan-based diaries of Margot such as the novel ''The Silent Sister'' by Mazal Alouf-Mizrahi.

She and T\u0103sl\u0103uanu fell in love and became engaged, marking the first break with Goga. On June 17, 1906, the couple married, and that year, he moved the ''Luceaf\u0103rul'' headquarters from Budapest to Sibiu, the first issue appearing there in October.
