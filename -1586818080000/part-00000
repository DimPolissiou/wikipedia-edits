The fervent desire of European merchants for a northern passage, the [[Northern Sea Route]] or the [[Northwest Passage]], to \"[[Cathay]]\" ([[China]]) caused water to win out, and by 1723 mapmakers such as [[Johann Homann]] featured an extensive \"Oceanus Septentrionalis\" at the northern edge of their charts.\n\nThe few expeditions to penetrate much beyond the [[Arctic Circle]] in this era added only small islands, such as [[Novaya Zemlya]] (11th century) and [[Spitzbergen]] (1596), though since these were often surrounded by [[Drift ice|pack-ice]], their northern limits were not so clear. The makers of [[Nautical chart|navigational charts]], more conservative than some of the more fanciful cartographers, tended to leave the region blank, with only fragments of known coastline sketched in.\n\nThis lack of knowledge of what lay north of the shifting barrier of ice gave rise to a number of conjectures.

Regional subsidence in the [[Jurassic]] and [[Triassic]] led to significant sediment deposition, creating many of the reservoir for current day oil and gas deposits. During the [[Cretaceous]] the Canadian Basin opened and tectonic activity due to the assembly of Alaska caused hydrocarbons to migrate toward what is now Prudhoe Bay. At the same time, sediments shed off the rising Canadian Rockies building out the large Mackenzie Delta. \n\nThe rifting apart of the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangea]], beginning in the Triassic opened the early Atlantic Ocean. Rifting then extended northward, opening the Arctic Ocean as [[mafic]] oceanic crust material erupted out of a branch of Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The Amerasia Basin may have opened first, with the Chulkchi Borderland moved along to the northeast by transform faults. Additional spreading helped to create the \"triple-junction\" of the Alpha-Mendeleev Ridge in the [[Late Cretaceous]]. \n\nThroughout the [[Cenozoic]], the subduction of the Pacific plate, the collision of India with Eurasia and the continued opening of the North Atlantic created new hydrocarbon traps. The seafloor began spreading from the Gakkel Ridge in the [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]], causing the Lomonosov Ridge to move farther from land and subside. \n\nBecause of sea ice and remote conditions, the geology of the Arctic Ocean is still poorly explored. ACEX drilling shed some light on the Lomonosov Ridge, which appears to be continental crust separated from the Barents-Kara Shelf in the Paleocene and then starved of sediment. It may contain up to 10 billion barrels of oil. The Gakkel Ridge rift is also poorly understand and may extend into the Laptev Sea.<ref>{{cite article|title=Geological History of the Arctic Ocean|year=2007|publisher=GEO ExPro|url=https://assets.geoexpro.com/legacy-files/articles/A%20Brief%20Geological%20History%20of%20the%20Arctic%20Ocean.pdf|author=Whaley, Jane }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Geologic Structures of the Arctic Basin |year=2019|publisher=Springer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s1fDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=geology+of+the+arctic+ocean&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiCvLyH8_zlAhWJct8KHSHYD1QQuwUwCHoECAkQBQ#v=onepage&q=geology%20of%20the%20arctic%20ocean&f=false|author=Piskarev, Poselov & Kaminsky, editors}}</ref>\n\n== Oceanography ==\n\n=== Water flow ===\n[[File:BrnBld BeringToFram.svg|left|upright=2.15|thumb|Distribution of the major [[water mass]] in the Arctic Ocean.

Water in the Beaufort Gyre is far less saline than that of the Chukchi Sea due to inflow from large Canadian and Siberian rivers.<ref name=Polar />\n\nThe final defined water mass in the Arctic Ocean is called Arctic Surface Water and is found from {{convert|150|-|200|m|abbr=off}}. The most important feature of this water mass is a section referred to as the sub-surface layer. It is a product of Atlantic water that enters through canyons and is subjected to intense mixing on the [[Siberian Shelf]].<ref name=Tomczak /> As it is entrained, it cools and acts a heat shield for the surface layer. This insulation keeps the warm Atlantic Water from melting the surface ice. Additionally, this water forms the swiftest currents of the Arctic, with speed of around 0.3\u20130.6&nbsp;m/s.<ref name=Tomczak /> Complementing the water from the canyons, some Pacific water that does not sink to the shelf region after passing through the Bering Strait also contributes to this water mass.\n\nWaters originating in the Pacific and Atlantic both exit through the Fram Strait between [[Greenland]] and [[Svalbard Island]], which is about {{convert|2,700|m|abbr=off}} deep and {{convert|350|km|abbr=off}} wide. This outflow is about 9 Sv.<ref name=Nature /> The width of the Fram Strait is what allows for both inflow and outflow on the Atlantic side of the Arctic Ocean. Because of this, it is influenced by the [[Coriolis force]], which concentrates outflow to the East Greenland Current on the western side and inflow to the [[Norwegian Current]] on the eastern side.<ref name=Tomczak /> Pacific water also exits along the west coast of Greenland and the [[Hudson Strait]] (1\u20132 Sv), providing nutrients to the Canadian Archipelago.<ref name=Nature />\n\nAs noted, the process of ice formation and movement is a key driver in Arctic Ocean circulation and the formation of water masses.  With this dependence, the Arctic Ocean experiences variations due to seasonal changes in sea ice cover. Sea ice movement is the result of wind forcing, which is related to a number of meteorological conditions that the Arctic experiences throughout the year.  For example, the Beaufort High\u2014an extension of the [[Siberian High]] system\u2014is a pressure system that drives the anticyclonic motion of the Beaufort Gyre.<ref name=Talley /> During the summer, this area of high pressure is pushed out closer to its Siberian and Canadian sides. In addition, there is a [[sea level pressure]] (SLP) ridge over Greenland that drives strong northerly winds through the Fram Strait, facilitating ice export. In the summer, the SLP contrast is smaller, producing weaker winds. A final example of seasonal pressure system movement is the low pressure system that exists over the Nordic and Barents Seas. It is an extension of the [[Icelandic Low]], which creates cyclonic ocean circulation in this area. The low shifts to center over the North Pole in the summer.  These variations in the Arctic all contribute to ice drift reaching its weakest point during the summer months.  There is also evidence that the drift is associated with the phase of the Arctic Oscillation and [[Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation]].<ref name=Talley />\n\n=== Sea ice ===\n[[File:2007 Arctic Sea Ice.jpg|thumb|Sea cover in the Arctic Ocean, showing the median, 2005 and 2007 coverage<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17047 |title=Continued Sea Ice Decline in 2005|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007164907/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17047 |archive-date=7 October 2006 |others=Graph by Robert Simmon, [[Earth Observatory]], and Walt Meier, [[NSIDC]]; photo by Nathaniel B.

The fervent desire of European merchants for a northern passage, the [[Northern Sea Route]] or the [[Northwest Passage]], to \"[[Cathay]]\" ([[China]]) caused water to win out, and by 1723 mapmakers such as [[Johann Homann]] featured an extensive \"Oceanus Septentrionalis\" at the northern edge of their charts.\n\nThe few expeditions to penetrate much beyond the [[Arctic Circle]] in this era added only small islands, such as [[Novaya Zemlya]] (11th century) and [[Spitzbergen]] (1596), though since these were often surrounded by [[Drift ice|pack-ice]], their northern limits were not so clear. The makers of [[Nautical chart|navigational charts]], more conservative than some of the more fanciful cartographers, tended to leave the region blank, with only fragments of known coastline sketched in.\n\nThis lack of knowledge of what lay north of the shifting barrier of ice gave rise to a number of conjectures. In England and other European nations, the [[Mythology|myth]] of an \"[[Open Polar Sea]]\" was persistent. [[Sir John Barrow, 1st Baronet|John Barrow]], longtime Second Secretary of the British [[Admiralty]], [[Arctic exploration|promoted exploration]] of the region from 1818 to 1845 in search of this.\n\n[[File:Map of the Arctic region showing the Northeast Passage, the Northern Sea Route and Northwest Passage, and bathymetry.png|thumb|upright=1.25|The Arctic region showing the [[Northeast Passage]], the [[Northern Sea Route]] within it, and the [[Northwest Passage]].]]\nIn the United States in the 1850s and 1860s, the explorers [[Elisha Kane]] and [[Isaac Israel Hayes]] both claimed to have seen part of this elusive body of water.

Regional subsidence in the [[Jurassic]] and [[Triassic]] led to significant sediment deposition, creating many of the reservoir for current day oil and gas deposits. During the [[Cretaceous]] the Canadian Basin opened and tectonic activity due to the assembly of Alaska caused hydrocarbons to migrate toward what is now Prudhoe Bay. At the same time, sediments shed off the rising Canadian Rockies building out the large Mackenzie Delta. \n\nThe rifting apart of the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangea]], beginning in the Triassic opened the early Atlantic Ocean. Rifting then extended northward, opening the Arctic Ocean as [[mafic]] oceanic crust material erupted out of a branch of Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The Amerasia Basin may have opened first, with the Chulkchi Borderland moved along to the northeast by transform faults. Additional spreading helped to create the \"triple-junction\" of the Alpha-Mendeleev Ridge in the [[Late Cretaceous]]. \n\nThroughout the [[Cenozoic]], the subduction of the Pacific plate, the collision of India with Eurasia and the continued opening of the North Atlantic created new hydrocarbon traps. The seafloor began spreading from the Gakkel Ridge in the [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]], causing the Lomonosov Ridge to move farther from land and subside. \n\nBecause of sea ice and remote conditions, the geology of the Arctic Ocean is still poorly explored.

It remains relatively stable, because the salinity effect on density is bigger than the temperature effect. It is fed by the freshwater input of the big Siberian and Canadian streams ([[Ob River|Ob]], [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]], [[Lena River|Lena]], [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie]]), the water of which quasi floats on the saltier, denser, deeper ocean water. Between this lower salinity layer and the bulk of the ocean lies the so-called [[halocline]], in which both salinity and temperature rise with increasing depth.\n[[File:Copepodkils.jpg|thumb|A [[copepod]]]]\n\nBecause of its relative isolation from other oceans, the Arctic Ocean has a uniquely complex system of water flow. It resembles some hydrological features of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], referring to its deep waters having only limited communication through the [[Fram Strait]] with the [[Atlantic Basin]], \"where the circulation is dominated by thermohaline forcing\u201d.<ref name=Tomczak>[Regional Oceanography: An Introduction.

The deepest water mass is called Arctic Bottom Water and begins around {{convert|900|m|abbr=off}} depth.<ref name=Tomczak /> It is composed of the densest water in the World Ocean and has two main sources: Arctic shelf water and Greenland Sea Deep Water. Water in the shelf region that begins as inflow from the Pacific passes through the narrow [[Bering Strait]] at an average rate of 0.8 Sverdrups and reaches the [[Chukchi Sea]].<ref name=Nature>[http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/arctic-ocean-circulation-going-around-at-the-102811553 Arctic Ocean Circulation: Going Around at the Top of the World. Retrieved 2 November 2013.]</ref>  During the winter, cold Alaskan winds blow over the Chukchi Sea, freezing the surface water and pushing this newly formed ice out to the Pacific. The speed of the ice drift is roughly 1\u20134&nbsp;cm/s.<ref name=Talley /> This process leaves dense, salty waters in the sea that sink over the continental shelf into the western Arctic Ocean and create a [[halocline]].<ref name=Polar>[http://polardiscovery.whoi.edu/arctic/circulation.html Arctic Ocean Circulation]. Polar Discovery</ref>\n[[File:Nares strait border (Kennedy channel).png|thumb|left| The [[Kennedy Channel]].]]\nThis water is met by Greenland Sea Deep Water, which forms during the passage of winter storms. As temperatures cool dramatically in the winter, ice forms and intense vertical convection allows the water to become dense enough to sink below the warm saline water below.<ref name=Tomczak />  Arctic Bottom Water is critically important because of its outflow, which contributes to the formation of Atlantic Deep Water. The overturning of this water plays a key role in global circulation and the moderation of climate.\n\nIn the depth range of {{convert|150|-|900|m|abbr=off}} is a water mass referred to as Atlantic Water. Inflow from the [[North Atlantic Current]] enters through the Fram Strait, cooling and sinking to form the deepest layer of the halocline, where it circles the [[Arctic Basin]] counter-clockwise.  This is the highest volumetric inflow to the Arctic Ocean, equalling about 10 times that of the Pacific inflow, and it creates the Arctic Ocean Boundary Current.<ref name=Nature /> It flows slowly, at about 0.02&nbsp;m/s.<ref name=Tomczak /> Atlantic Water has the same salinity as Arctic Bottom Water but is much warmer (up to 3&nbsp;\u00b0C). In fact, this water mass is actually warmer than the surface water, and remains submerged only due to the role of salinity in density.<ref name=Tomczak />  When water reaches the basin it is pushed by strong winds into a large circular current called the [[Beaufort Gyre]]. Water in the Beaufort Gyre is far less saline than that of the Chukchi Sea due to inflow from large Canadian and Siberian rivers.<ref name=Polar />\n\nThe final defined water mass in the Arctic Ocean is called Arctic Surface Water and is found from {{convert|150|-|200|m|abbr=off}}. The most important feature of this water mass is a section referred to as the sub-surface layer. It is a product of Atlantic water that enters through canyons and is subjected to intense mixing on the [[Siberian Shelf]].<ref name=Tomczak /> As it is entrained, it cools and acts a heat shield for the surface layer. This insulation keeps the warm Atlantic Water from melting the surface ice. Additionally, this water forms the swiftest currents of the Arctic, with speed of around 0.3\u20130.6&nbsp;m/s.<ref name=Tomczak /> Complementing the water from the canyons, some Pacific water that does not sink to the shelf region after passing through the Bering Strait also contributes to this water mass.\n\nWaters originating in the Pacific and Atlantic both exit through the Fram Strait between [[Greenland]] and [[Svalbard Island]], which is about {{convert|2,700|m|abbr=off}} deep and {{convert|350|km|abbr=off}} wide. This outflow is about 9 Sv.<ref name=Nature /> The width of the Fram Strait is what allows for both inflow and outflow on the Atlantic side of the Arctic Ocean. Because of this, it is influenced by the [[Coriolis force]], which concentrates outflow to the East Greenland Current on the western side and inflow to the [[Norwegian Current]] on the eastern side.<ref name=Tomczak /> Pacific water also exits along the west coast of Greenland and the [[Hudson Strait]] (1\u20132 Sv), providing nutrients to the Canadian Archipelago.<ref name=Nature />\n\nAs noted, the process of ice formation and movement is a key driver in Arctic Ocean circulation and the formation of water masses.  With this dependence, the Arctic Ocean experiences variations due to seasonal changes in sea ice cover. Sea ice movement is the result of wind forcing, which is related to a number of meteorological conditions that the Arctic experiences throughout the year.  For example, the Beaufort High\u2014an extension of the [[Siberian High]] system\u2014is a pressure system that drives the anticyclonic motion of the Beaufort Gyre.<ref name=Talley /> During the summer, this area of high pressure is pushed out closer to its Siberian and Canadian sides. In addition, there is a [[sea level pressure]] (SLP) ridge over Greenland that drives strong northerly winds through the Fram Strait, facilitating ice export. In the summer, the SLP contrast is smaller, producing weaker winds. A final example of seasonal pressure system movement is the low pressure system that exists over the Nordic and Barents Seas. It is an extension of the [[Icelandic Low]], which creates cyclonic ocean circulation in this area. The low shifts to center over the North Pole in the summer.  These variations in the Arctic all contribute to ice drift reaching its weakest point during the summer months.  There is also evidence that the drift is associated with the phase of the Arctic Oscillation and [[Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation]].<ref name=Talley />\n\n=== Sea ice ===\n[[File:2007 Arctic Sea Ice.jpg|thumb|Sea cover in the Arctic Ocean, showing the median, 2005 and 2007 coverage<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17047 |title=Continued Sea Ice Decline in 2005|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007164907/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17047 |archive-date=7 October 2006 |others=Graph by Robert Simmon, [[Earth Observatory]], and Walt Meier, [[NSIDC]]; photo by Nathaniel B.

The video for the song ''T\u00ealinaz'' was shot in [[Istanbul]] with a large number of dancers and was also broadcast in [[Turkish television]]. The soundtechnique who was used was very high.\n\nJanuary 2007, Zakaria released his sixth album, titled ''Genc\u00ee P\u00eer'' (trans.: \"Old youth\") consisting of 12 songs. The album was largely a work of Fantezi spiced up with pop music and [[R&B]].  The song ''Roji Bextim'' became a successful [[R&B]] hit. Zakaria shot a musicvideo for this album in [[Istanbul]] and [[Cappadocia]], called ''Gull\u00ea'' (trans: \"Rose\"), with an Italian\nmodel, playing the leading role. The video was released on 25 December such a Christmas present\nto his fans.\n\n5 October 2008, Zakaria received the invitation, with a respectful request to perform at the Re:orient festival in Sweden. To honor this invitation, he brought 22 professional and gifted musicians along from Kurdistan. Zakaria made history when he brought such a large group of musicians to Europe, this was never earlier achieved in that manner. The concert took place in Stockholm Concert House, the performance was well received among the fans and was noted in the Swedish media as a great success.\n\nIn November 2008 he receives the \"Medal of honor\" (Gold medal), and proclaimed Iraq\u2019s and Kurdistan\u2019s greatest artist of the ''NGO'', based on the progress and success throughout his career. He is pointed here to be the artist to raise Kurdish music to whole new dimensions. There was a great number of audience presence at the ceremony. One fact, worth the trouble of pointing out; this occasion was aired live on 8 different Kurdish and Arabic channels!\n\n7 April 2010 Zakaria released his latest album titled \"Laperrey Sp\u00ee\" (White Page), consisting of 14 tracks. All the benefit of the album was granted to help lonely orphan and poor children, especially those who have become victims of war and because of lack and poverty have been deprived and cannot continue school and education.\n\nRead more on his official website [http://www.zakariamusic.com]\n\n==Discography==\n'''To Hat\u00ee <small>(You came)</small>''' \u2013 (January 1998)\n* 01.

Posner has written multiple adaptations of Chekhov and Shakespeare works. In 2013, ''Stupid Fucking Bird'' premiered at the [[Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company]] in Washington, DC. According to Howard Shalwitz, the play takes a satirical spin on a theatrical classic, but has the essence of Chekhov's original intent for the piece\u2014what it means to create art.<ref name=HS>{{cite journal|last1=Shalwitz|first1=Howard|title=An Introduction To Aaron Posner's ''Stupid Fucking Bird''|journal=TheatreForum|date=2013|issue=44|pages=3\u20134<!-- |accessdate=25 November 2017 -->}}</ref>\n\n==Writing process==\nAaron Posner has a large collection of adaptations of classical works in his repertoire. While directing another production at the Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company, a friend of Posner remarked that the actors cast in the show would be ideal for a Chekhov play. This sparked the initial idea for ''Stupid Fucking Bird'' in Posner, who began work on the idea. His first draft loosely followed the plot of ''The Seagull\u2014''although he cut and combined the original group of characters to create a cast of seven. The draft was put to the test when Posner, the director and the actors were invited to Lake George Theatre Lab in Upstate New York. There, Posner and his team worked on final edits. Throughout the week, they workshopped the script: the team held cold readings, blocked, rehearsed; and to close the week, performed in front of an audience. James Suggs supplied the musical score for the show, which\u2014like the show itself\u2014was influenced by contemporary music, but drew inspiration from Russian opera and dance. Finally, the show premiered at the Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company in Washington DC on May 31, 2013. The show received positive reviews, and is noted as a successful adaptation of Chekhov, containing the intensity, tragedy, humor, and thought-provoking content for which Chekhov is known.<ref name=HS />\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Act One===\n''Stupid Fucking Bird'' follows the life of Con (Conrad), a struggling playwright who is desperately trying to write a new play. Act I begins shortly before a theatrical presentation that Con is putting on at his mother's country home, in which his flighty girlfriend Nina is playing the lead. Con's mother Emma, a famous actress and overbearing presence in Con's life, unhappily attends the performance with her new lover Trigorin, a successful novelist. Con's good friends Dev and Mash also attend the performance. Dev is desperately in love with Mash, while Mash is infatuated with Con, who is oblivious to Mash's love because of his unhealthy obsession with Nina. Nina wants to become a famous actress more than anything, and begins to have feelings for Trigorin, who is a successful writer who could advance her acting career. Act One ends with Con attempting to kill himself after discovering Nina's feelings for Trigorin.<ref name=AP>{{cite book|last1=Posner|first1=Aaron|title=Stupid Fucking Bird|date=May 27, 2013|publisher=TheatreForum|location=United States|isbn=978-0-8222-3250-6|pages=5\u201327<!-- |accessdate=November 24, 2013 -->}}</ref>\n\n===Act Two===\nAt the beginning of Act Two, we discover that Con has failed in his suicide attempt. While Nina is attempting to be a comforting presence in Con's life, we see her act upon her impulses to seduce Trigorin. Her seduction is soon thwarted by Emma. Nina leaves, flustered, while Trigorin begs Emma to release him from her clutches. She refuses, but Trigorin finds a way to wriggle free of her grip and runs away with Nina.<ref name=AP />\n\n===Act Three=== \nAct Three begins four years after the end of Act Two. The ensemble of the show is reuniting to celebrate the birthday of their dear friend Sorn. The first scene begins with Mash and Dev, who have married and have three children. It is discovered that Trigorin is back with Emma, after an unforeseen tragedy concerning the death of a baby he had had with Nina. Even after four years, Con is still in love with Nina and in denial about her absence. After hearing that she is back for Sorn's birthday, he attempts to visit her and she rejects him. Con believes all hope is lost, until she unexpectedly knocks on his door. Her acting career has plummeted, as has her physical and mental health. She is in a somewhat hysteric state, demanding to know why Con shot a seagull to prove his love for her. After having a complete mental breakdown, Nina exits abruptly, leaving Con to wallow in his self-pity. Breaking the fourth wall, Con addresses the audience, informing them that, in the original adaptation of the script, this is where his character finally kills himself. He pulls out a gun ([[Chekhov's gun]]) and points it at his head. Nevertheless, Con somehow reaches a sort of catharsis while speaking to the audience. He drops the gun, turns towards the audience and says, \"Stop the fucking play\" to conclude the show.<ref name=AP />\n\n==Characters==\n* Con \u2013 (based on Konstantin Gavrilovich Treplev) The protagonist, a struggling playwright.
