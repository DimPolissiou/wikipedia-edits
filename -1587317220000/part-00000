Yeah, truly it is. Me real name Sid Monster.}}</ref> Despite his voracious appetite for cookies, Cookie Monster shows awareness of [[Healthy diet|healthy eating]] habits for young children and also enjoys fruits and [[eggplant]].\n\nHe is known to have a mother, a younger sister, and an identically-designed cousin (who ironically does not like cookies). All three share his characteristic [[navy blue]] fur and \"[[googly eyes]].\" He also has a father, who appeared in a ''[[Monsterpiece Theater]]'' sketch promoting [[energy conservation]], [[water conservation]] and [[environmentalism]]. Both Cookie Monster's mother and father share his enormous appetite and craving for cookies. He and his ''Sesame Street'' friends are popular motifs on T-shirts.\n\n==Origin==\nThe book ''[[Jim Henson's Designs and Doodles]]'' explains Cookie Monster's origin as follows: \"In 1966, Henson drew three monsters that ate cookies and appeared in a [[General Foods]] commercial<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QngRWeEJGo Jim Henson's 1966 test commercial for General Foods Canada snack products Wheels, Flutes and Crowns] on the Jim Henson Company's YouTube official channel.</ref> that featured three crunchy snack foods: [[Wheels, Flutes and Crowns|Wheels, Crowns and Flutes]]. Each snack was represented by a different monster. The Wheel-Stealer was a short, fuzzy monster with wonky eyes and sharply pointed teeth. The Flute-Snatcher was a speed demon with a long, sharp nose and windblown hair. The Crown-Grabber was a hulk of a monster with a [[Boris Karloff]] accent and teeth that resembled giant knitting needles.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n\"These monsters had insatiable appetites for the snack foods they were named after. Each time the Muppet narrator, a human-looking fellow, fixes himself a tray of Wheels, Flutes and Crowns, they disappear before he can eat them. One by one, the monsters sneak in and zoom away with the snacks. Frustrated and peckish, the narrator warns viewers that these pesky monsters could be disguised as someone in your own home, at which point the monsters briefly turn into people and then dissolve back to monsters again.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nAs it turns out, these commercials were never aired \u2014 but all three monsters had a future in the Muppet cast. The \"Crown-Grabber\" was used in a sketch on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', in which he ruins a girl's beautiful day. Known from then on as the [[Beautiful Day Monster]], he made a number of appearances on ''Sesame Street'' and ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. The \"Flute-Snatcher\" turned into [[The Frackles|Snake Frackle]], a background monster from ''[[The Great Santa Claus Switch]]'' and ''The Muppet Show''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIn 1967, Henson used the \"Wheel-Stealer\" puppet for an [[IBM]] training film called ''[[The Coffee Break Machine|Coffee Break Machine]]''. In the sketch, called \"The Computer Dinner\", the monster (with frightening eyes and fangs) devours a complex coffee making machine as it describes its different parts. When he is finished, the machine announces the monster has activated the machine's anti-vandalism system, which contains the most powerful explosives known to man. The monster promptly explodes. This sketch was also performed in October, 1967 on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''. It was also later performed on the [[George Burns]] episode of ''The Muppet Show''' using the [[Luncheon Counter Monster]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nTwo years later, Henson used a similarly-designed and equally ravenous monster for three commercials selling [[Munchos]], a [[Frito-Lay]] potato chip. This time, the puppet was called Arnold, the Munching Monster. After the three ads were produced, Henson had the opportunity to renew the contract. He chose not to, because at that point he was working on ''Sesame Street'' \u2014 and that monster puppet was moving on to the next stage in his career. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}} According to Frank Oz, in a later routine the then unnamed monster won a quiz show and for winning was \"given the choice of $10,000 cash, a new car, a trip to Hawaii, or a cookie.\" He took the cookie and from then on he was Cookie Monster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=439454321|title=Not My Job: We Quiz Frank Oz On L. Frank Baum, Author Of 'Wizard Of Oz'|publisher=NPR}}</ref>\n\nCookie Monster, still unnamed, made his ''Sesame Street'' debut in the first episode, interfering with [[Kermit the Frog]]'s \"famous W lecture\" by eating a model \"W\" bit by bit. He turns it into an \"N,\" a \"V,\" and finally an \"I,\" to Kermit's frustration. He then tries to eat Kermit.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIt was during the first season that Cookie Monster got his name and began using the growly vernacular (e.g., \"Me eat cookie!\") that would become part of his character. His signature song, \"[[C Is For Cookie]]\", was first aired during the 1971\u201372 season, and became one of the best-known songs from ''Sesame Street''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Development==\nIn 2006, in response to growing concerns about record levels of [[childhood obesity]] in the United States, ''Sesame Street'' began airing segments titled [[Healthy Habits for Life]]. In these segments, the Muppet characters of ''Sesame Street'' talk about healthy habits, such as eating properly and exercising. The ''Healthy Habits for Life'' segments spawned Internet rumors that Cookie Monster's name had been changed to Veggie Monster or would be taken off the show entirely.<ref name=\"npr\">\n{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18659731 |title=Cookie Monster: A Sweet, Sensual Id, Unfiltered |first=Elizabeth |last=Blair |date=2008-02-11 |work=[[All Things Considered]]: In Character |publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]] |accessdate=2008-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-04-07-cookie-monster_x.htm |title=Cookie Monster: 'Me eat less cookies' |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2005-04-07 |last=Carter |first=Chelsea J |accessdate=2008-03-02}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2007 appearance on [[Martha Stewart]]'s TV program, Cookie Monster explained his new philosophy that \"Cookies are a sometimes food.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=November 20, 2007 |url=http://blog.sfgate.com/parenting/2007/11/20/why-is-cookie-monster-eating-carrots/ |title=Why is Cookie Monster eating carrots? |first=Mike |last=Adamick |work=[[SF Gate]] (blog)}}</ref>\n\nOn February 10, 2008, [[NPR]] host Elizabeth Blair interviewed Cookie Monster for the ''[[All Things Considered]]'' segment ''In Character''.

Cookie Monster also claimed to have \"crazy times during the '70s and '80s,\" referring to himself as \"the [[Robert Downey Jr.#Substance abuse|Robert Downey Jr.]] of cookies.\" After eating a cookie to prove he still likes cookies, Cookie Monster asked if the Peabody Award, a round medallion on a small pedestal, was a cookie.<ref name=\"Colbert interview\">{{cite interview|subject=Cookie Monster|interviewer=[[Stephen Colbert (character)|Stephen Colbert]]|title=Cookie Monster|url=http://www.cc.com/video-clips/zcd35g/the-colbert-report-cookie-monster|type=Interview: video|work=[[The Colbert Report]]|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=2008-06-19|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref> When Colbert returned to speak to Cookie Monster at the end of the show, the award had disappeared and Cookie Monster was wiping his mouth with a napkin.<ref name=\"Colbert interview\" />\n\nOn November 24, 2010, Cookie Monster started a Facebook page as part of a campaign to host ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/24/cookie-monster-auditions-for-snl-hosting-gig/ | work=CNN | title=Cookie Monster auditions to be 'SNL' host &ndash; The Marquee Blog | date=2010-11-24}}</ref> Though his bid to host ''Saturday Night Live'' failed, he was allowed to appear with [[Jeff Bridges]] when Jeff hosted the show and sang the Christmas song \"[[Silver Bells]]\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/snl-clip-jeff-bridges-dueting-61580 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | title='SNL' Clip of Jeff Bridges Dueting With Cookie Monster Becomes Viral Video Hit | date=2010-12-19}}</ref>\n\n==Casting history==\n'''Main performers'''\n*[[Frank Oz]] \u2013 From 1969 to 2001; occasionally until 2004\n*[[David Rudman]] \u2013 From 2001 to present\n\nDavid Rudman officially became Cookie Monster in ''Sesame Street's'' 2002 season (taped 2001).

He and his ''Sesame Street'' friends are popular motifs on T-shirts.\n\n==Origin==\nThe book ''[[Jim Henson's Designs and Doodles]]'' explains Cookie Monster's origin as follows: \"In 1966, Henson drew three monsters that ate cookies and appeared in a [[General Foods]] commercial<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QngRWeEJGo Jim Henson's 1966 test commercial for General Foods Canada snack products Wheels, Flutes and Crowns] on the Jim Henson Company's YouTube official channel.</ref> that featured three crunchy snack foods: [[Wheels, Flutes and Crowns|Wheels, Crowns and Flutes]]. Each snack was represented by a different monster. The Wheel-Stealer was a short, fuzzy monster with wonky eyes and sharply pointed teeth. The Flute-Snatcher was a speed demon with a long, sharp nose and windblown hair. The Crown-Grabber was a hulk of a monster with a [[Boris Karloff]] accent and teeth that resembled giant knitting needles.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n\"These monsters had insatiable appetites for the snack foods they were named after. Each time the Muppet narrator, a human-looking fellow, fixes himself a tray of Wheels, Flutes and Crowns, they disappear before he can eat them. One by one, the monsters sneak in and zoom away with the snacks. Frustrated and peckish, the narrator warns viewers that these pesky monsters could be disguised as someone in your own home, at which point the monsters briefly turn into people and then dissolve back to monsters again.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nAs it turns out, these commercials were never aired \u2014 but all three monsters had a future in the Muppet cast. The \"Crown-Grabber\" was used in a sketch on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', in which he ruins a girl's beautiful day. Known from then on as the [[Beautiful Day Monster]], he made a number of appearances on ''Sesame Street'' and ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. The \"Flute-Snatcher\" turned into [[The Frackles|Snake Frackle]], a background monster from ''[[The Great Santa Claus Switch]]'' and ''The Muppet Show''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIn 1967, Henson used the \"Wheel-Stealer\" puppet for an [[IBM]] training film called ''[[The Coffee Break Machine|Coffee Break Machine]]''. In the sketch, called \"The Computer Dinner\", the monster (with frightening eyes and fangs) devours a complex coffee making machine as it describes its different parts. When he is finished, the machine announces the monster has activated the machine's anti-vandalism system, which contains the most powerful explosives known to man. The monster promptly explodes. This sketch was also performed in October, 1967 on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''. It was also later performed on the [[George Burns]] episode of ''The Muppet Show''' using the [[Luncheon Counter Monster]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nTwo years later, Henson used a similarly-designed and equally ravenous monster for three commercials selling [[Munchos]], a [[Frito-Lay]] potato chip. This time, the puppet was called Arnold, the Munching Monster. After the three ads were produced, Henson had the opportunity to renew the contract. He chose not to, because at that point he was working on ''Sesame Street'' \u2014 and that monster puppet was moving on to the next stage in his career. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}} According to Frank Oz, in a later routine the then unnamed monster won a quiz show and for winning was \"given the choice of $10,000 cash, a new car, a trip to Hawaii, or a cookie.\" He took the cookie and from then on he was Cookie Monster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=439454321|title=Not My Job: We Quiz Frank Oz On L. Frank Baum, Author Of 'Wizard Of Oz'|publisher=NPR}}</ref>\n\nCookie Monster, still unnamed, made his ''Sesame Street'' debut in the first episode, interfering with [[Kermit the Frog]]'s \"famous W lecture\" by eating a model \"W\" bit by bit. He turns it into an \"N,\" a \"V,\" and finally an \"I,\" to Kermit's frustration. He then tries to eat Kermit.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIt was during the first season that Cookie Monster got his name and began using the growly vernacular (e.g., \"Me eat cookie!\") that would become part of his character. His signature song, \"[[C Is For Cookie]]\", was first aired during the 1971\u201372 season, and became one of the best-known songs from ''Sesame Street''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Development==\nIn 2006, in response to growing concerns about record levels of [[childhood obesity]] in the United States, ''Sesame Street'' began airing segments titled [[Healthy Habits for Life]]. In these segments, the Muppet characters of ''Sesame Street'' talk about healthy habits, such as eating properly and exercising. The ''Healthy Habits for Life'' segments spawned Internet rumors that Cookie Monster's name had been changed to Veggie Monster or would be taken off the show entirely.<ref name=\"npr\">\n{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18659731 |title=Cookie Monster: A Sweet, Sensual Id, Unfiltered |first=Elizabeth |last=Blair |date=2008-02-11 |work=[[All Things Considered]]: In Character |publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]] |accessdate=2008-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2005-04-07-cookie-monster_x.htm |title=Cookie Monster: 'Me eat less cookies' |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2005-04-07 |last=Carter |first=Chelsea J |accessdate=2008-03-02}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2007 appearance on [[Martha Stewart]]'s TV program, Cookie Monster explained his new philosophy that \"Cookies are a sometimes food.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=November 20, 2007 |url=http://blog.sfgate.com/parenting/2007/11/20/why-is-cookie-monster-eating-carrots/ |title=Why is Cookie Monster eating carrots? |first=Mike |last=Adamick |work=[[SF Gate]] (blog)}}</ref>\n\nOn February 10, 2008, [[NPR]] host Elizabeth Blair interviewed Cookie Monster for the ''[[All Things Considered]]'' segment ''In Character''.

The district headquarter is [[Hassan, Karnataka|Hassan]]. It is located between Bangalore and Mangalore. \n\n==History==\nHassan district was the seat of the [[Hoysala Empire]] which at its peak ruled large parts of south India from [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] as its early capital and [[Halebidu]] as its later capital during the period 1000 - 1334 CE.<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hassan |volume=13 |page=51}}</ref>\n\nThe district is named Hassan after the Goddess \"Haasanamba\", the goddess and presiding deity of the town. The history of Hassan district is essentially the history of two of the well known dynasties that have ruled Karnataka, the [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] of Talkad (350 - 999 CE) and the [[Hoysala Empire]] (1000 - 1334 CE). In the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] kings patronised Chennakesava of [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] as their family deity. It was also ruled by [[Adilshahi]]s of [[Bijapur district, Karnataka|Bijapur]] and [[Mughal Empire]] after decline of the Vijayanagar. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Hassan became a land of contention between the [[Keladi Nayaka]]s of Shimoga and the [[Mysore Kingdom]]. It finally merged as an independent [[Mysore kingdom]].\n\n===Modern===\nDuring the 14th century, invasions by the [[Sultanate of Delhi]] weakened the Hoysala state, and the district became part of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].<ref name=\"Meyer, Sir William Stevenson 1931. p. 64\">Meyer, Sir William Stevenson.

The Kaveri flows through the southernmost part of the District.\n\nWestern portions of the district are drained by the headwaters of the [[Netravati River]], which flows northwestward to empty into the Arabian Sea. Portions of Asikere taluk in the northeast are drained by the Hogari River, a tributary of the [[Tungabhadra River]]. The basins of the Kaveri and Tungabhadra are separated by a range of low granitic hills extending through Belur, Hassan, and Arsikere taluks.\n\nThe Bisle Ghat, or Bisale Ghat, is a portion of the Western Ghats range in the western part of the district. Main peaks include Jenkalbetta ({{convert|4558|ft|m}}), the highest peak in the district, Murkangudda ({{convert|4265|ft|m}}), and Devarbetta ({{convert|4206|ft|m}}). [[Pushpagiri (mountain)|Pushpagiri]] (1,712 meters), lies immediately southwest in [[Kodagu]] and [[Dakshina Kannada]] districts. [[Bisle Reserve Forest|Bisle]], Kagneri, Kanchankumari reserve forests cover portions the Bisle Ghat, and adjoin [[Pushpagiri Wildlife Sanctuary]] in Kodagu.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nHassan District is administratively divided into eight [[taluka]]s (Panchayat blocks): [[Alur, Hassan|Alur]], [[Arkalgud]], [[Arsikere]], [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]], [[Channarayapatna]], [[Hassan, Karnataka|Hassan]], [[Holenarasipura]] (H.N.

They encountered the British fleet under [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Lord Nelson]], recently assembled to meet this threat, in the Atlantic Ocean along the southwest coast of Spain, off [[Cape Trafalgar]], near the town of [[Los Ca\u00f1os de Meca]]. Villeneuve was uncertain about engaging, and the Franco-Spanish fleet failed to fully organize. In contrast, Nelson was decisive, organizing the British fleet into two columns sailing straight into the enemy to pierce its wavering lines.\n\nIn a fierce battle, 27 British [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] fought 33 French and Spanish ships of the line. Although the lead ships of the British columns were heavily battered, with Nelson\u2019s [[flagship]] {{HMS|Victory}} nearly disabled, the greater experience and training of the Royal Navy overcame the greater numbers of the French and Spanish navies. The Franco-Spanish fleet lost 22 ships; the British lost none. During the battle, Nelson was shot by a French musketeer, and he died shortly before the battle ended. Villeneuve was captured along with his flagship [[French ship Bucentaure (1803)|''Bucentaure'']]. He later attended Nelson's funeral while a captive on parole in Britain. Admiral [[Federico Carlos Gravina y N\u00e1poli|Federico Gravina]], the senior Spanish flag officer, escaped with the remnant of the fleet. He died five months later from wounds sustained during the battle.\n\nThe victory confirmed the naval supremacy Britain had established during the course of the eighteenth century, and it was achieved in part through Nelson's departure from the prevailing naval [[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|tactical orthodoxy]] of the day.<ref>Bennet, Geoffrey (2004). ''The Battle of Trafalgar''. England: Pen & Sword Books Limited, CPI UK, South Yorkshire.</ref> Conventional practice at the time was for opposing fleets to engage each other in single parallel lines in order to facilitate signalling and disengagement and to maximize fields of fire and target areas. Nelson instead arranged his ships into columns sailing perpendicularly into the enemy fleet's line.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Trafalgar Campaign}}\n[[File:HoratioNelson1.jpg|thumb|upright|Vice Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio, Lord Nelson]], by [[Lemuel Francis Abbott]]]]\n[[File:Cuthbert Collingwood, Baron Collingwood by Henry Howard.jpg|thumb|upright|Vice Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]]]\n[[File:Amiraldevilleneuve.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]], the French Admiral]]\n[[File:FedericoGravinaYN\u00e1poliAn\u00f3nimoHacia1810.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Federico Carlos Gravina y N\u00e1poli|Federico Gravina]], the Spanish Admiral]]\n\nIn 1805, the [[First French Empire]], under [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], was the dominant military land power on the European continent, while the British Royal Navy controlled the seas.<ref>{{cite book |last = Kongstam |first = Angus |authorlink = |year = 2003 |origyear=2003 |chapter =The New Alexander|page=46 |title = Historical Atlas of the Napoleonic Era|publisher = Mercury Books|location = London |isbn = 1904668046}}</ref> During the course of the war, the British imposed a naval [[blockade]] on France, which affected trade and kept the French from fully mobilising their naval resources.<ref>Stilwell (Ed.) (2005) pp. 22\u201324</ref> Despite several successful evasions of the blockade by the French navy, it failed to inflict a major defeat upon the British, who were able to attack French interests at home and abroad with relative ease.<ref name=HOV247>Willis (2013) p. 247</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Third Coalition]] declared war on France, after the short-lived [[Peace of Amiens]], Napoleon was determined to invade Britain. To do so, he needed to ensure that the Royal Navy would be unable to disrupt the invasion [[flotilla]], which would require control of the [[English Channel]].<ref name=WFATO134>Adkins & Adkins (2006) p. 134</ref>\n\nThe main French [[Naval fleet|fleets]] were at [[Brest, France|Brest]] in Brittany and at [[Toulon]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast. Other ports on the French Atlantic coast harboured smaller [[Squadron (naval)|squadrons]]. France and Spain were allied, so the Spanish fleet based in [[C\u00e1diz]] and [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] was also available.<ref name=TC107>Stilwell (Ed.) (2005) p. 107</ref>\n\nThe British possessed an experienced and well-trained corps of naval officers.<ref>When offered his pick from the [[Navy List]] by [[Charles Middleton, 1st Baron Barham|Lord Barham]] (the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]]), Nelson replied \"Choose yourself, my lord, the same spirit actuates the whole profession; you cannot choose wrong\" {{harv|Allen|1853|p=210}}.</ref> By contrast, some of the best officers in the French navy had either been executed or had left the service during the early part of the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=TC104>Stilwell (Ed.) (2005) p. 104</ref>\n\nVice-Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] had taken command of the French Mediterranean fleet following the death of [[Latouche-Treville|Latouche Treville]]. There had been more competent officers, but they had either been employed elsewhere or had fallen from Napoleon's favour.<ref name=NB97>Best (2005) p. 97</ref> Villeneuve had shown a distinct lack of enthusiasm for facing Nelson and the Royal Navy after the French defeat at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1798.<ref name=NB121>Best (2005) p. 121</ref>\n\nNapoleon's naval plan in 1805 was for the French and Spanish fleets in the Mediterranean and C\u00e1diz to break through the blockade and join forces in the [[Caribbean]]. They would then return, assist the fleet in Brest to emerge from the blockade, and together clear the English Channel of Royal Navy ships, ensuring a safe passage for the invasion barges.<ref name name=EOS171>Lavery (2009) p. 171</ref>\n\n===Pursuit of Villeneuve===\nEarly in 1805, [[Vice Admiral]] Lord Nelson commanded the British fleet blockading [[Toulon]]. Unlike [[William Cornwallis]], who maintained a [[Blockade#Close, distant, and loose blockades|close blockade]] off Brest with the [[Channel Fleet]], Nelson adopted a loose blockade in the hope of luring the French out for a major battle.<ref name=EOS171/> However, Villeneuve's fleet successfully evaded Nelson's when the British were blown off station by storms. Nelson commenced a search of the Mediterranean, erroneously supposing that the French intended to make for [[Egypt]]. However, Villeneuve took his fleet through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], rendezvoused with the Spanish fleet, and sailed as planned for the Caribbean. Once Nelson realised that the French had crossed the Atlantic Ocean, he set off in pursuit.<ref>Admirals of the time, due to the slowness of communications, were given considerable autonomy to make [[Naval strategy|strategic]] as well as [[Naval tactics|tactical]] decisions.</ref>\n\n===C\u00e1diz===\nVilleneuve returned from the Caribbean to [[Europe]], intending to break the blockade at Brest,<ref name=NB121/> but after two of his Spanish ships were captured during the [[Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)|Battle of Cape Finisterre]] by a squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir [[Robert Calder]], Villeneuve abandoned this plan and sailed back to [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] in northern Spain.<ref name=NB137>Best (2005) p. 137</ref> There he received orders from Napoleon to return to Brest according to the main plan.<ref name=NB141>Best (2005) p. 141</ref>\n\nNapoleon's invasion plans for Britain depended on having a sufficiently large number of ships of the line before [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] in France. This would require Villeneuve's force of 33 ships to join Vice-Admiral [[Honor\u00e9 Joseph Antoine Ganteaume|Ganteaume]]'s force of 21 ships at Brest, along with a squadron of five ships under Captain Allemand, which would have given him a combined force of 59 ships of the line.\n\nWhen Villeneuve set sail from Ferrol on 10 August, he was under orders from Napoleon to sail northward toward Brest. Instead, he worried that the British were observing his manoeuvres, so on 11 August, he sailed southward towards C\u00e1diz on the southwestern coast of Spain.<ref name=NB142>Best (2005) p. 142</ref> With no sign of Villeneuve's fleet, on 25 August, the three French army corps' invasion force near Boulogne broke camp and marched into Germany, where it was later engaged. This ended the immediate threat of invasion.<ref name=TC32>Stilwell (Ed.) (2005) p. 32</ref><ref name=NB157>Best (2005) p. 157</ref>\n\nThe same month, Nelson returned home to Britain after two years of duty at sea.<ref name=NB145>Best (2005) p.145</ref> He remained ashore for 25&nbsp;days and was warmly received by his countrymen.<ref>Best (2005) pp. 161\u201362</ref> Word reached Britain on 2 September about the combined French and Spanish fleet in C\u00e1diz harbour.<ref name=NN268>Lee (2005) p. 268</ref> Nelson had to wait until 15 September before his ship, [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']], was ready to sail.<ref name=NN273>Lee (2005) p. 273</ref>\n\nOn 15 August, Cornwallis decided to detach 20 ships of the line from the fleet guarding the English Channel and to have them sail southward to engage the enemy forces in Spain.<ref name=NN283>Lee (2005) p. 283</ref> This left the Channel drastically reduced of large vessels, with only 11 ships of the line present.<ref>Lee (2005) pp. 283\u201384</ref> This detached force formed the nucleus of the British fleet that would fight at Trafalgar. This fleet, under the command of Vice-Admiral Calder, reached C\u00e1diz on 15 September. Nelson joined the fleet on 28 September to take command.<ref name=NB170>Best (2005) p. 170</ref>\n\nThe British fleet used [[frigate]]s (faster, but too fragile for the line of battle), to keep a constant watch on the harbour, while the main force remained out of sight, approximately 50&nbsp;miles (80&nbsp;km) west of the shore.<ref name=NN288>Lee (2005) p. 288</ref> Nelson's hope was to lure the combined Franco-Spanish force out and engage it in a decisive battle. The force watching the harbour was led by Captain [[Henry Blackwood|Blackwood]], commanding [[HMS Euryalus (1803)|HMS ''Euryalus'']].<ref name=NN288/> His squadron of seven ships comprised five frigates, a [[schooner]], and a [[brig]].<ref name=NB190>Best (2005) p. 190</ref>\n\n===Supply situation===\nAt this point, Nelson's fleet badly needed provisioning. On 2 October, five ships of the line, [[HMS Queen (1769)|HMS ''Queen'']], [[HMS Canopus (1798)|''Canopus'']], [[HMS Spencer (1800)|''Spencer'']], [[HMS Zealous (1785)|''Zealous'']], [[French ship Tigre (1793)|''Tigre'']], and the frigate [[HMS Endymion (1797)|HMS ''Endymion'']] were dispatched to [[Gibraltar]] under [[Thomas Louis|Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Louis]] for supplies.<ref>James p. 22</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle Of Trafalgar By William Lionel Wyllie, Juno Tower, CFB Halifax Nova Scotia.jpg|upright=1.35|left|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar By [[William Lionel Wyllie]], Juno Tower, [[CFB Halifax]], Nova Scotia, Canada]]\n\nThese ships were later diverted for convoy duty in the [[Mediterranean]], although Nelson had expected them to return. Other British ships continued to arrive, and by 15 October the fleet was up to full strength for the battle. Nelson also lost Calder's [[flagship]], the 98-gun [[HMS Prince of Wales (1794)|''Prince of Wales'']], which he sent home as Calder had been recalled by the Admiralty to face a court martial for his apparent lack of aggression during the engagement off Cape Finisterre on 22 July.\n\nMeanwhile, Villeneuve's fleet in C\u00e1diz was also suffering from a serious supply shortage that could not be easily rectified by the cash-poor French.<ref name=NN278>Lee (2005) p. 278</ref> The blockade maintained by the British fleet had made it difficult for the Franco-Spanish allies to obtain stores, and their ships were ill-equipped. Villeneuve's ships were also more than two thousand men short of the force needed to sail. These were not the only problems faced by the Franco-Spanish fleet. The main French ships of the line had been kept in harbour for years by the British blockade with only brief sorties. The French crews included few experienced sailors, and, as most of the crew had to be taught the elements of seamanship on the few occasions when they got to sea, gunnery was neglected. The hasty voyage across the Atlantic and back used up vital supplies. Villeneuve's supply situation began to improve in October, but news of Nelson's arrival made Villeneuve reluctant to leave port. Indeed, his captains had held a vote on the matter and decided to stay in harbour.\n\nOn 16 September, Napoleon gave orders for the French and Spanish ships at C\u00e1diz to put to sea at the first favourable opportunity, join with seven Spanish ships of the line then at [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], go to [[Naples]] and land the soldiers they carried to reinforce his troops there, then fight decisively if they met a numerically inferior British fleet.\n\n==The fleets==\n{{broader|Order of battle at the Battle of Trafalgar}}\n\n===British===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px;\"\n|-\n!\n!British\n!Franco-Spanish\n|-\n|First rates\n|3\n|4\n|-\n|Second rates\n|4\n|0\n|-\n|Third rates\n|20\n|29\n|-\n|Total ships of the line\n|27\n|33\n|-\n|Other ships\n|6\n|7\n|}\n\nOn 21 October, Admiral Nelson had 27 ships of the line under his command. Nelson's flagship, [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']], captained by [[Thomas Masterman Hardy]], was one of three 100-gun [[First-rate|first rates]] in his fleet. He also had four 98-gun [[Second-rate|second rates]] and 20 [[Third-rate|third rates]]. One of the third rates was an 80-gun vessel, and 16 were 74-gun vessels. The remaining three were 64-gun ships, which were being phased out of the Royal Navy at the time of the battle. Nelson also had four frigates of 38 or 36 guns, a 12-gun [[schooner]] and a 10-gun [[cutter (boat)|cutter]].\n\n===Franco-Spanish===\nAgainst Nelson, Vice-Admiral Villeneuve, sailing on his flagship ''Bucentaure'', fielded 33 ships of the line, including some of the largest in the world at the time. The Spanish contributed four first-rates to the fleet. Three of these ships, one at 130 guns ([[Spanish ship Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad|''Santisima Trinidad'']]) and two at 112 guns (''Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias'', ''Santa Ana''), were much larger than anything under Nelson's command. The fourth first-rate carried 100 guns. The fleet had six 80-gun third-rates, (four French and two Spanish), and one Spanish 64-gun third-rate. The remaining 22 third-rates were 74-gun vessels, of which 14 were French and eight Spanish. In total, the Spanish contributed 15 ships of the line and the French 18. The fleet also included five 40-gun frigates and two 18-gun [[brig]]s, all French.\n\n==The battle==\n\n===Nelson's plan===\nThe prevailing tactical orthodoxy at the time involved manoeuvring to approach the enemy fleet in a single [[line of battle]] and then engaging broadside in parallel lines.<ref name=FB07P66>Fremont-Barnes (2007) p. 66</ref> In previous times, fleets had usually engaged in a mixed m\u00eal\u00e9e of chaotic one-on-one battles. One reason for the development of the line of battle system was to facilitate control of the fleet: if all the ships were in line, signalling in battle became possible.<ref>Ireland (2000) p. 52</ref> The line also allowed either side to disengage by breaking away in formation; if the attacker chose to continue, their line would be broken as well.<ref name=FB07P66/> This often led to inconclusive battles, or allowed the losing side to minimise its losses; but Nelson wanted a conclusive action, giving his well-trained crews a chance to fight ship to ship.<ref>Best (2005) p. 154</ref>\n\nNelson's solution to the problem was to cut the opposing line in three. Approaching in two columns, sailing perpendicular to the enemy's line, one towards the centre of the opposing line and one towards the trailing end, his ships would surround the middle third, and force them to fight to the end.<ref name=Best182>Best (2005) p. 182</ref> Nelson hoped specifically to cut the line just in front of the French flagship, ''Bucentaure''; the isolated ships in front of the break would not be able to see the flagship's signals, which he hoped would take them out of combat while they re-formed. This echoed the [[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|tactics]] used by [[Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan|Admiral Duncan]] at the [[Battle of Camperdown]] and [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Admiral Jervis]] at the [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]], both in 1797.<ref name=NE238>White (2002) p. 238</ref>\n\n[[File:The Battle of Trafalgar by William Clarkson Stanfield.jpg|thumb|''The Battle of Trafalgar'' by [[Clarkson Stanfield]]]]\n\nThe plan had three principal advantages. First, the British fleet would close with the Franco-Spanish as quickly as possible, preventing their escape.<ref name=NTA174>White (2005) p. 174</ref> Second, it would quickly bring on a m\u00eal\u00e9e and frantic battle by breaking the Franco-Spanish line and inducing a series of individual ship-to-ship actions, in which the British were likely to prevail. Nelson knew that the superior seamanship, faster gunnery and better morale of his crews were great advantages.<ref name=NTA173>White (2005) p. 173</ref> Third, it would bring a decisive concentration on the rear of the Franco-Spanish fleet. The ships in the [[Vanguard|van]] of the enemy fleet would have to turn back to support the rear, which would take a long time.<ref name=Best182/> Additionally, once the Franco-Spanish line had been broken, their ships would be relatively defenceless against powerful broadsides from the British fleet, and it would take them a long time to reposition to return fire.\n\nThe main drawback of attacking head-on was that as the leading British ships approached, the Franco-Spanish Combined Fleet would be able to direct [[raking fire|raking]] [[broadside]] fire at their bows, to which they would be unable to reply. To lessen the time the fleet was exposed to this danger, Nelson had his ships make all available sail (including [[Studding sail|stunsails]]), yet another departure from the norm.<ref name=NB215>Tracy (2008) p. 215</ref> He was also well aware that French and Spanish gunners were ill-trained and would have difficulty firing accurately from a moving gun platform. The Combined Fleet was sailing across a heavy [[Swell (ocean)|swell]], causing the ships to roll heavily and exacerbating the problem. Nelson's plan was indeed a gamble, but a carefully calculated one.<ref name=HOV266>Willis (2013) p. 266</ref>\n\nDuring the period of blockade off the coast of Spain in October, Nelson instructed his captains, over two dinners aboard ''Victory'', on his plan for the approaching battle. The order of sailing, in which the fleet was arranged when the enemy was first sighted, was to be the order of the ensuing action so that no time would be wasted in forming two lines.<ref name=NE239>White (2002) p. 239</ref> The first, led by his second-in-command Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]], was to sail into the rear of the enemy line, while the other, led by Nelson, was to sail into the centre and vanguard.<ref name=NTA174/> In preparation for the battle, Nelson ordered the ships of his fleet to be painted in a distinctive yellow and black pattern (later known as the [[Nelson Chequer]]) that would make them easy to distinguish from their opponents.<ref>Best (2005) pp. 182\u201383</ref>\n\nNelson was careful to point out that something had to be left to chance. Nothing is sure in a sea battle, so he left his captains free from all hampering rules by telling them that \"No captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of the enemy.\"<ref name=NE238/> In short, [[emergence|circumstances]]<!-- so while Nelson had a top-level plan, he allowed for considerable [[emergence]] to occur in action to strengthen his potential outcomes; in system theory also known as [[Bottom-up design]] --> would dictate the execution, subject to the guiding rule that the enemy's rear was to be cut off and superior force concentrated on that part of the enemy's line.\n\nAdmiral Villeneuve himself expressed his belief that Nelson would use some sort of unorthodox attack, presciently speculating that Nelson would drive right at his line. But his long game of [[cat and mouse]] with Nelson had worn him down, and he was suffering from a loss of nerve. Fearing that his inexperienced officers would be unable to maintain formation in more than one group, he chose keep the single line that became Nelson's target.<ref>Stilwell (Ed.) (2005) pp. 115\u201316</ref>\n\n===Departure===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--many paragraphs have no citations-->\nThe Combined Fleet of French and Spanish warships anchored in C\u00e1diz under the leadership of Admiral Villeneuve was in disarray. On 16 September 1805 Villeneuve received orders from Napoleon to sail the Combined Fleet from C\u00e1diz to Naples. At first, Villeneuve was optimistic about returning to the Mediterranean, but soon had second thoughts. A war council was held aboard his flagship, ''[[French ship Bucentaure (1803)|Bucentaure]]'', on 8 October.<ref name=NB178>Best (2005) p. 178</ref> While some of the French captains wished to obey Napoleon's orders, the Spanish captains and other French officers, including Villeneuve, thought it best to remain in C\u00e1diz.<ref name=NB179>Best (2005) p. 179</ref> Villeneuve changed his mind yet again on 18 October 1805, ordering the Combined Fleet to sail immediately even though there were only very light winds.<ref>{{harvnb|Schom|1990|pp=301\u201306}}.</ref>\n\nThe sudden change was prompted by a letter Villeneuve had received on 18 October, informing him that Vice-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Rosily]] had arrived in [[Madrid]] with orders to take command of the Combined Fleet.<ref>Lee (2005) pp. 289\u201390</ref> Stung by the prospect of being disgraced before the fleet, Villeneuve resolved to go to sea before his successor could reach C\u00e1diz. At the same time, he received intelligence that a detachment of six British ships (Admiral Louis' squadron), had docked at Gibraltar, thus weakening the British fleet. This was used as the pretext for sudden change.\n\nThe weather, however, suddenly turned calm following a week of gales. This slowed the progress of the fleet leaving the harbour, giving the British plenty of warning. Villeneuve had drawn up plans to form a force of four squadrons, each containing both French and Spanish ships. Following their earlier vote on 8 October to stay put, some captains were reluctant to leave C\u00e1diz, and as a result they failed to follow Villeneuve's orders closely and the fleet straggled out of the harbour in no particular formation.\n\nIt took most of 20 October for Villeneuve to get his fleet organised; it eventually set sail in three columns for the Straits of Gibraltar to the southeast. That same evening, ''[[French ship Achille (1803)|Achille]]'' spotted a force of 18 British ships of the line in pursuit. The fleet began to prepare for battle and during the night, they were ordered into a single line. The following day, Nelson's fleet of 27 ships of the line and four frigates was spotted in pursuit from the northwest with the wind behind it. Villeneuve again ordered his fleet into three columns, but soon changed his mind and restored a single line. The result was a sprawling, uneven formation.\n\nAt 5:40&nbsp;a.m. on 21 October, the British were about 21&nbsp;miles <!-- nautical (which nautical?) or statute? --> (34&nbsp;km) to the northwest of Cape Trafalgar, with the Franco-Spanish fleet between the British and the Cape. About 6&nbsp;a.m., Nelson gave the order to prepare for battle.<ref>Signal log of HMS ''Bellerophon'', 21 October 1805</ref> At 8&nbsp;a.m., the British frigate ''Euryalus'', which had been keeping watch on the Combined Fleet overnight, observed the British fleet still \"forming the lines\" in which it would attack.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Battle of Trafalgar: The Logbook of the Euryalus, 21st October 1805|url=http://chasingnelson.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/the-battle-of-trafalgar-logbook-of_22.html|website=chasingnelson.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate=11 June 2017|date=22 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt 8&nbsp;a.m., Villeneuve ordered the fleet to ''wear together'' (turn about) and return to C\u00e1diz. This reversed the order of the allied line, placing the rear division under Rear-Admiral [[Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley]] in the vanguard. The wind became contrary at this point, often shifting direction. The very light wind rendered manoeuvring virtually impossible for all but the most expert seamen. The inexperienced crews had difficulty with the changing conditions, and it took nearly an hour and a half for Villeneuve's order to be completed. The French and Spanish fleet now formed an uneven, angular crescent, with the slower ships generally to [[leeward]] and closer to the shore.\n\nBy 11&nbsp;a.m. Nelson's entire fleet was visible to Villeneuve, drawn up in two parallel columns. The two fleets would be within range of each other within an hour. Villeneuve was concerned at this point about forming up a line, as his ships were unevenly spaced in an irregular formation drawn out nearly five miles <!-- nautical (which nautical?) or statute? -->(8&nbsp;km) long as Nelson's fleet approached.\n\nAs the British drew closer, they could see that the enemy was not sailing in a tight order, but in irregular groups. Nelson could not immediately make out the French flagship as the French and Spanish were not flying command pennants.\n\nNelson was outnumbered and outgunned, the enemy totalling nearly 30,000 men and 2,568 guns to his 17,000 men and 2,148 guns. The Franco-Spanish fleet also had six more ships of the line, and so could more readily combine their fire. There was no way for some of Nelson's ships to avoid being \"doubled on\" or even \"trebled on\".\n\nAs the two fleets drew closer, anxiety began to build among officers and sailors; one British sailor described the approach thus: \"During this momentous preparation, the human mind had ample time for meditation, for it was evident that the fate of England rested on this battle\".<ref name=\"Adkins, Roy 2004\">{{harvnb|Adkins|2004a|p={{page needed|date=February 2012}}}}.</ref>\n\n===Battle===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--many paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:England expects...retouched.jpg|thumb|Nelson's signal, \"[[England expects that every man will do his duty]]\", flying from ''Victory'' on the bicentenary of the Battle of Trafalgar]]\n[[File:England Expects Signal.svg|thumb|Nelson's signal.<ref name=SignalWasFamous/>]]\n\nThe battle progressed largely according to Nelson's plan. At 11:45, Nelson sent the famous flag signal, \"[[England expects that every man will do his duty]]\".<ref name=SignalWasFamous>{{cite web|url= http://www.aboutnelson.co.uk/england%20expcts.htm|title=England Expects|publisher=aboutnelson.co.uk| accessdate=16 September 2006 }}</ref>\n{{quote|His Lordship came to me on the [[Poop deck|poop]], and after ordering certain signals to be made, about a quarter to noon, he said, \"Mr. [[John Pasco|Pasco]], I wish to say to the fleet, ENGLAND CONFIDES THAT EVERY MAN WILL DO HIS DUTY\" and he added \"You must be quick, for I have one more to make which is for close action.\" I replied, \"If your Lordship will permit me to substitute 'expects' for 'confides' the signal will soon be completed, because the word 'expects' is in the vocabulary, and 'confides' must be spelt,\" His Lordship replied, in haste, and with seeming satisfaction, \"That will do, Pasco, make it directly.\"<ref name=\"NS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nelson-society.org.uk/html/body_england_expects.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324080325/http://www.nelson-society.org.uk/html/body_england_expects.htm|archivedate=24 March 2005|title=England Expects|publisher=The Nelson Society|accessdate=24 March 2005}}</ref>}}\n\nThe term \"England\" was widely used at the time to refer to the United Kingdom; the British fleet included significant contingents from Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. Unlike the photographic depiction (right), this signal would have been shown on the [[mizzen]] mast only and would have required 12 lifts.\n\nAs the battle opened, the French and Spanish were in a ragged curved line headed north. As planned, the British fleet was approaching the Franco-Spanish line in two columns. Leading the northern, [[windward and leeward|windward]] column in ''Victory'' was Nelson, while Collingwood in the 100-gun [[HMS Royal Sovereign (1786)|''Royal Sovereign'']] led the second, leeward, column. The two British columns approached from the west at nearly a right angle to the allied line. Nelson led his column into a feint toward the van of the Franco-Spanish fleet and then abruptly turned toward the actual point of attack. Collingwood altered the course of his column slightly so that the two lines converged at this line of attack.\n\n[[File:Trafalgar-Auguste Mayer.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's conception of [[HMS Sandwich (1759)|HMS ''Sandwich'']] fighting the French [[flagship]] ''[[French ship Bucentaure (1803)|Bucentaure]]'' (completely dismasted) at Trafalgar.

As she approached the allied line, she came under fire from ''Fougueux'', [[French ship Indomptable (1789)|''Indomptable'']], ''San Justo'', and ''San Leandro'', before breaking the line just astern of Admiral Alava's flagship ''[[Spanish ship Santa Ana|Santa Ana]]'', into which she fired a devastating [[double-shotted]] raking broadside.\n\n[[File:Trafalgar 1200hr.svg|thumb|Artist's conception of the situation at noon as ''[[HMS Royal Sovereign (1786)|Royal Sovereign]]'' was breaking into the Franco-Spanish line]]\n\nThe second ship in the British lee column, [[HMS Belleisle (1795)|''Belleisle'']], was engaged by [[French ship L'Aigle (1794)|''L'Aigle'']], ''Achille'', [[French ship Neptune (1803)|''Neptune'']], and ''Fougueux''; she was soon completely dismasted, unable to manoeuvre and largely unable to fight, as her sails blinded her batteries, but kept flying her flag for 45&nbsp;minutes until the following British ships came to her rescue.\n\nFor 40&nbsp;minutes, ''Victory'' was under fire from [[French ship H\u00e9ros (1795)|''H\u00e9ros'']], [[Spanish ship Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad (1769)|''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'']], [[French ship Redoutable (1791)|''Redoutable'']], and ''Neptune''; although many shots went astray, others killed and wounded a number of her crew and shot her wheel away, so that she had to be steered from her tiller belowdecks, all before she could respond. At 12:45, ''Victory'' cut the enemy line between Villeneuve's flagship ''Bucentaure'' and ''Redoutable''; she came close to ''Bucentaure'', firing a devastating raking broadside through ''Bucentaure''<nowiki/>'s stern which killed and wounded many on her gundecks. Villeneuve thought that boarding would take place, and with the [[French Imperial Eagle|Eagle]] of his ship in hand, told his men, \"I will throw it onto the enemy ship and we will take it back there!\" However ''Victory'' engaged the 74-gun ''Redoutable''; ''Bucentaure'' was left to  the next three ships of the British windward column: [[HMS Temeraire (1798)|''Temeraire'']], [[HMS Conqueror (1801)|''Conqueror'']], and {{HMS|Neptune|1797|6}}.\n\n[[File:Fall of Nelson.jpg|thumb|left|Painter Denis Dighton's imagining of Nelson being shot on the quarterdeck of ''Victory'']]\nA general m\u00eal\u00e9e ensued. ''Victory'' locked masts with the French ''Redoutable,'' whose crew, including a strong infantry corps (with three captains and four lieutenants), gathered for an attempt to board and seize ''Victory''. A [[musket]] bullet fired from the [[Top (sailing ship)|mizzentop]] of ''Redoutable'' struck Nelson in the left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches below his right scapula in the muscles of his back. Nelson exclaimed, \"They finally succeeded, I am dead.\" He was carried below decks.\n\n[[File:Trafalgar1.jpg|thumb|Painter Nicholas Pocock's conception of the situation at 1300h]]\n\n''Victory'''s gunners were called on deck to fight boarders, and she ceased firing. The gunners were forced back below decks by French [[grenade]]s. As the French were preparing to board ''Victory'', ''Temeraire'', the second ship in the British windward column, approached from the starboard bow of ''Redoutable'' and fired on the exposed French crew with a [[carronade]], causing many casualties.\n\nAt 13:55, the French [[Jean Jacques Etienne Lucas|Captain Lucas]] of ''Redoutable'', with 99 fit men out of 643 and severely wounded himself, surrendered. The French ''Bucentaure'' was isolated by ''Victory'' and ''Temeraire'', and then engaged by HMS ''Neptune'', {{HMS|Leviathan|1790|6}}, and ''Conqueror''; similarly, ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'' was isolated and overwhelmed, surrendering after three hours.\n\n[[File:Trafalgar2.jpg|thumb|left|Painter Nicholas Pocock's conception of the situation at 1700h]]\n\nAs more and more British ships entered the battle, the ships of the allied centre and rear were gradually overwhelmed. The allied van, after long remaining quiescent, made a futile demonstration and then sailed away. The British took 22 vessels of the Franco-Spanish fleet and lost none. Among the captured French ships were ''L'Aigle'', [[French ship Alg\u00e9siras (1804)|''Alg\u00e9siras'']], {{HMS|Berwick|1775|2}}, ''Bucentaure'', ''Fougueux'', [[French ship Intr\u00e9pide|''Intr\u00e9pide'']], ''Redoutable'', and [[French ship Swiftsure|''Swiftsure'']]. The Spanish ships taken were ''Argonauta'', ''Bahama'', ''Monarca'', ''Neptuno'', [[Spanish ship San Agust\u00edn|''San Agust\u00edn'']], ''San Ildefonso'', [[Spanish ship San Juan Nepomuceno|''San Juan Nepomuceno'']], [[Spanish ship Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad (1769)|''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'']], and ''Santa Ana''. Of these, ''Redoutable'' sank, and ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'' and ''Argonauta'' were scuttled by the British. ''Achille'' exploded, ''Intr\u00e9pide'' and ''San August\u00edn'' burned, and ''L'Aigle'', ''Berwick'', ''Fougueux'', and ''Monarca'' were wrecked in a gale following the battle.\n\nAs Nelson lay dying, he ordered the fleet to anchor, as a storm was predicted. However, when the storm blew up, many of the severely damaged ships sank or ran aground on the [[shoals]]. A few of them were recaptured, some by the French and Spanish prisoners overcoming the small prize crews, others by ships sallying from C\u00e1diz. Surgeon [[William Beatty (surgeon)|William Beatty]] heard Nelson murmur, \"Thank God I have done my duty\"; when he returned, Nelson's voice had faded, and his pulse was very weak.<ref name=\"Hibbert 376\">{{harvnb| Hibbert|1994|p=376}}.</ref> He looked up as Beatty took his pulse, then closed his eyes.

Nelson died at half-past four, three hours after being hit.<ref name=\"Hibbert 376\"/>\n\nTowards the end of the battle, and with the combined fleet being overwhelmed, the still relatively un-engaged portion of the van under Rear-Admiral Dumanoir Le Pelley tried to come to the assistance of the collapsing centre. After failing to fight his way through, he decided to break off the engagement, and led four French ships, his flagship the 80-gun [[French ship Formidable (1795)|''Formidable'']], the 74-gun ships [[French ship Scipion (1798)|''Scipion'']], [[French ship Duguay Trouin (1797)|''Duguay Trouin'']] and [[French ship Mont-Blanc (1791)|''Mont Blanc'']] away from the fighting.

With a storm gathering in strength off the Spanish coast, he sailed westwards to clear [[Cape St Vincent]], prior to heading north-west, swinging eastwards across the [[Bay of Biscay]], and aiming to reach the French port at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]].<ref name=\"Adkin530\"/> These four ships remained at large until their encounter with and attempt to chase a British frigate brought them in range of a British squadron under [[Sir Richard Strachan, 6th Baronet|Sir Richard Strachan]], which captured them all on 4 November 1805 at the [[Battle of Cape Ortegal]].<ref name=\"Adkin530\"/>\n\n====Cosmao and MacDonnell sortie====\n[[File:Trafalgar, ships scattered.jpg|thumb|The gale after Trafalgar, depicted by [[Thomas Buttersworth]].

Cosmao claimed in his report that the rescue plan was entirely his idea, but Vice-Admiral Escano recorded a meeting of Spanish and French commodores at which a planned rescue was discussed and agreed upon.

On boarding her, her British captors found that she was in a sinking state, and so removed the British prize crew, and nearly all of her original Spanish crew members. The nearly empty ''Monarca'' parted her cable and was wrecked during the night. Despite the efforts of her British prize crew, ''Rayo'' was driven onshore on 26 October and wrecked, with the loss of 25 men.

British prize crews were captured and given good treatment. On 27 October, Collingwood offered the governor of C\u00e1diz to put his Spanish wounded prisoners ashore and set them free. The governor and Gravina offered in exchange to release their British prisoners, who boarded the British fleet. The French would later join this humanitarian agreement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://abcblogs.abc.es/espejo-de-navegantes/2015/10/20/el-epilogo-de-trafalgar/|title=El ep\u00edlogo de Trafalgar|last=Rodr\u00edguez Gonz\u00e1lez|first=Agust\u00edn Ram\u00f3n|date=2015-10-20|work=Espejo de navegantes|access-date=2018-10-21|language=es-ES}}</ref>\n\nThe disparity in losses has been attributed by some historians less to Nelson's daring tactics than to the difference in fighting readiness of the two fleets.{{sfn|Nicolson|2005|p=9\u201310}} Nelson's fleet was made up of ships of the line which had spent a considerable amount of sea time during the months of blockades of French ports, whilst the French fleet had generally been at anchor in port. However, Villeneuve's fleet had just spent months at sea crossing the Atlantic twice, which supports the proposition that the main difference between the two fleets' combat effectiveness was the morale of the leaders. The daring tactics employed by Nelson were to ensure a strategically decisive result. The results vindicated his naval judgement.\n\n==Results of the battle==\n[[File:MuseoNaval Hispalois bajas espa\u00f1olas batalla Trafalgar.jpg|thumb|Report of Spanish losses in the combat of 21 October.]]\n\nWhen Rosily arrived in C\u00e1diz, he found only five French ships, rather than the 18 he was expecting. The surviving ships remained bottled up in C\u00e1diz until 1808 when Napoleon invaded Spain. The French ships were then [[Capture of Rosily Squadron|seized by the Spanish forces]] and put into service against France.\n\nHMS ''Victory'' made her way to Gibraltar for repairs, carrying Nelson's body. She put into Rosia Bay, Gibraltar and after emergency repairs were carried out, returned to Britain. Many of the injured crew were taken ashore at Gibraltar and treated in the Naval Hospital. Men who subsequently died from injuries sustained at the battle are buried in or near the [[Trafalgar Cemetery]], at the south end of [[Main Street, Gibraltar]].\n\nOne [[Royal Marine]] officer was killed on board ''Victory''; Captain Charles Adair. Royal Marine Lieutenant Lewis Buckle Reeve was seriously wounded and lay next to Nelson.<ref>Reeve's Naval General Service Medal with Trafalgar clasp and Muster List for HMS ''Victory'' are on show at the [[Royal Marines Museum]], [[Southsea]], Britain {{harv|BBC staff|2008}}.</ref>\n\nThe battle took place the day after the [[Battle of Ulm]], and Napoleon did not hear about it for weeks\u2014the [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]] had left Boulogne to fight Britain's allies before they could combine their armies.

After his parole in 1806, he returned to France, where he was found dead in his inn room during a stop on the way to Paris, with six stab wounds in the chest from a dining knife. It was officially recorded that he had committed suicide.\n\nDespite the British victory over the Franco-Spanish navies, Trafalgar had negligible impact on the remainder of the [[War of the Third Coalition]]. Less than two months later, Napoleon decisively defeated the Third Coalition at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], knocking Austria out of the war and forcing the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Although Trafalgar meant France could no longer challenge Britain at sea, Napoleon proceeded to establish the [[Continental System]] in an attempt to deny Britain trade with the continent. The Napoleonic Wars continued for another ten years after Trafalgar.{{sfn|Harding|1999|pp=96\u2013117}}\n\nNelson's body was preserved in a barrel of brandy for the trip home to a hero's funeral.<ref name=\"Adkins, Roy 2004\"/>\n\n==Consequences==\n[[File:Broadside titled \"The Battle of Trafalgar\".jpg|thumb|A [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]] from the 1850s recounts the story]]\n\nFollowing the battle, the Royal Navy was never again seriously challenged by the French fleet in a large-scale engagement. Napoleon had already abandoned his plans of invasion before the battle and they were never revived. The battle did not mean, however, that the French naval challenge to Britain was over. First, as the French control over the continent expanded, Britain had to take active steps with the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Battle of Copenhagen]] in 1807 and elsewhere in 1808 to prevent the ships of smaller European navies from falling into French hands. This effort was largely successful, but did not end the French threat as Napoleon instituted a large-scale shipbuilding programme that had produced a fleet of 80 ships of the line at the time of his fall from power in 1814, with more under construction. In comparison, Britain had 99 ships of the line in active commission in 1814, and this was close to the maximum that could be supported. Given a few more years, the French could have realised their plans to commission 150 ships of the line and again challenge the Royal Navy, compensating for the inferiority of their crews with sheer numbers.<ref name=\"glover\">{{harvnb|Glover|1967|pp=233\u201352}}.</ref> For almost 10&nbsp;years after Trafalgar, the Royal Navy maintained a close blockade of French bases and anxiously observed the growth of the French fleet.

They encountered the British fleet under [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Lord Nelson]], recently assembled to meet this threat, in the Atlantic Ocean along the southwest coast of Spain, off [[Cape Trafalgar]], near the town of [[Los Ca\u00f1os de Meca]]. Villeneuve was uncertain about engaging, and the Franco-Spanish fleet failed to fully organize. In contrast, Nelson was decisive, organizing the British fleet into two columns sailing straight into the enemy to pierce its wavering lines. \n\nIn a fierce battle, 27 British [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] fought 33 French and Spanish ships of the line. Although the lead ships of the British columns were heavily battered, with Nelson\u2019s [[flagship]] {{HMS|Victory}} nearly disabled, the greater experience and training of the Royal Navy overcame the greater numbers of the French and Spanish navies. The Franco-Spanish fleet lost 22 ships; the British lost none. During the battle, Nelson was shot by a French musketeer, and he died shortly before the battle ended. Villeneuve was captured along with his flagship [[French ship Bucentaure (1803)|''Bucentaure'']]. He later attended Nelson's funeral while a captive on parole in Britain. Admiral [[Federico Carlos Gravina y N\u00e1poli|Federico Gravina]], the senior Spanish flag officer, escaped with the remnant of the fleet. He died five months later from wounds sustained during the battle.\n\nThe victory confirmed the naval supremacy Britain had established during the course of the eighteenth century, and it was achieved in part through Nelson's departure from the prevailing naval [[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|tactical orthodoxy]] of the day.<ref>Bennet, Geoffrey (2004). ''The Battle of Trafalgar''. England: Pen & Sword Books Limited, CPI UK, South Yorkshire.</ref> Conventional practice at the time was for opposing fleets to engage each other in single parallel lines in order to facilitate signalling and disengagement and to maximize fields of fire and target areas. Nelson instead arranged his ships into columns sailing perpendicularly into the enemy fleet's line.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Trafalgar Campaign}}\n[[File:HoratioNelson1.jpg|thumb|upright|Vice Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio, Lord Nelson]], by [[Lemuel Francis Abbott]]]]\n[[File:Cuthbert Collingwood, Baron Collingwood by Henry Howard.jpg|thumb|upright|Vice Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]]]\n[[File:Amiraldevilleneuve.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]], the French Admiral]]\n[[File:FedericoGravinaYN\u00e1poliAn\u00f3nimoHacia1810.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Federico Carlos Gravina y N\u00e1poli|Federico Gravina]], the Spanish Admiral]]\n\nIn 1805, the [[First French Empire]], under [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], was the dominant military land power on the European continent, while the British Royal Navy controlled the seas.<ref>{{cite book |last = Kongstam |first = Angus |authorlink = |year = 2003 |origyear=2003 |chapter =The New Alexander|page=46 |title = Historical Atlas of the Napoleonic Era|publisher = Mercury Books|location = London |isbn = 1904668046}}</ref> During the course of the war, the British imposed a naval [[blockade]] on France, which affected trade and kept the French from fully mobilising their naval resources.<ref>Stilwell (Ed.)

They would then return, assist the fleet in Brest to emerge from the blockade, and together clear the English Channel of Royal Navy ships, ensuring a safe passage for the invasion barges.<ref name name=EOS171>Lavery (2009) p. 171</ref>\n\n===Pursuit of Villeneuve===\nEarly in 1805, [[Vice Admiral]] Lord Nelson commanded the British fleet blockading [[Toulon]]. Unlike [[William Cornwallis]], who maintained a [[Blockade#Close, distant, and loose blockades|close blockade]] off Brest with the [[Channel Fleet]], Nelson adopted a loose blockade in the hope of luring the French out for a major battle.<ref name=EOS171/> However, Villeneuve's fleet successfully evaded Nelson's when the British were blown off station by storms. Nelson commenced a search of the Mediterranean, erroneously supposing that the French intended to make for [[Egypt]]. However, Villeneuve took his fleet through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], rendezvoused with the Spanish fleet, and sailed as planned for the Caribbean. Once Nelson realised that the French had crossed the Atlantic Ocean, he set off in pursuit.<ref>Admirals of the time, due to the slowness of communications, were given considerable autonomy to make [[Naval strategy|strategic]] as well as [[Naval tactics|tactical]] decisions.</ref>\n\n===C\u00e1diz===\nVilleneuve returned from the Caribbean to [[Europe]], intending to break the blockade at Brest,<ref name=NB121/> but after two of his Spanish ships were captured during the [[Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)|Battle of Cape Finisterre]] by a squadron under Vice-Admiral Sir [[Robert Calder]], Villeneuve abandoned this plan and sailed back to [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] in northern Spain.<ref name=NB137>Best (2005) p. 137</ref> There he received orders from Napoleon to return to Brest according to the main plan.<ref name=NB141>Best (2005) p. 141</ref>\n\nNapoleon's invasion plans for Britain depended on having a sufficiently large number of ships of the line before [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] in France. This would require Villeneuve's force of 33 ships to join Vice-Admiral [[Honor\u00e9 Joseph Antoine Ganteaume|Ganteaume]]'s force of 21 ships at Brest, along with a squadron of five ships under Captain Allemand, which would have given him a combined force of 59 ships of the line.\n\nWhen Villeneuve set sail from Ferrol on 10 August, he was under orders from Napoleon to sail northward toward Brest. Instead, he worried that the British were observing his manoeuvres, so on 11 August, he sailed southward towards C\u00e1diz on the southwestern coast of Spain.<ref name=NB142>Best (2005) p. 142</ref> With no sign of Villeneuve's fleet, on 25 August, the three French army corps' invasion force near Boulogne broke camp and marched into Germany, where it was later engaged.

This fleet, under the command of Vice-Admiral Calder, reached C\u00e1diz on 15 September. Nelson joined the fleet on 28 September to take command.<ref name=NB170>Best (2005) p. 170</ref>\n\nThe British fleet used [[frigate]]s (faster, but too fragile for the line of battle), to keep a constant watch on the harbour, while the main force remained out of sight, approximately 50&nbsp;miles (80&nbsp;km) west of the shore.<ref name=NN288>Lee (2005) p. 288</ref> Nelson's hope was to lure the combined Franco-Spanish force out and engage it in a decisive battle. The force watching the harbour was led by Captain [[Henry Blackwood|Blackwood]], commanding [[HMS Euryalus (1803)|HMS ''Euryalus'']].<ref name=NN288/> His squadron of seven ships comprised five frigates, a [[schooner]], and a [[brig]].<ref name=NB190>Best (2005) p. 190</ref>\n\n===Supply situation===\nAt this point, Nelson's fleet badly needed provisioning. On 2 October, five ships of the line, [[HMS Queen (1769)|HMS ''Queen'']], [[HMS Canopus (1798)|''Canopus'']], [[HMS Spencer (1800)|''Spencer'']], [[HMS Zealous (1785)|''Zealous'']], [[French ship Tigre (1793)|''Tigre'']], and the frigate [[HMS Endymion (1797)|HMS ''Endymion'']] were dispatched to [[Gibraltar]] under [[Thomas Louis|Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Louis]] for supplies.<ref>James p. 22</ref>\n\n[[File:Battle Of Trafalgar By William Lionel Wyllie, Juno Tower, CFB Halifax Nova Scotia.jpg|upright=1.35|left|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar By [[William Lionel Wyllie]], Juno Tower, [[CFB Halifax]], Nova Scotia, Canada]]\n\nThese ships were later diverted for convoy duty in the [[Mediterranean]], although Nelson had expected them to return. Other British ships continued to arrive, and by 15 October the fleet was up to full strength for the battle. Nelson also lost Calder's [[flagship]], the 98-gun [[HMS Prince of Wales (1794)|''Prince of Wales'']], which he sent home as Calder had been recalled by the Admiralty to face a court martial for his apparent lack of aggression during the engagement off Cape Finisterre on 22 July.\n\nMeanwhile, Villeneuve's fleet in C\u00e1diz was also suffering from a serious supply shortage that could not be easily rectified by the cash-poor French.<ref name=NN278>Lee (2005) p. 278</ref> The blockade maintained by the British fleet had made it difficult for the Franco-Spanish allies to obtain stores, and their ships were ill-equipped. Villeneuve's ships were also more than two thousand men short of the force needed to sail. These were not the only problems faced by the Franco-Spanish fleet. The main French ships of the line had been kept in harbour for years by the British blockade with only brief sorties. The French crews included few experienced sailors, and, as most of the crew had to be taught the elements of seamanship on the few occasions when they got to sea, gunnery was neglected. The hasty voyage across the Atlantic and back used up vital supplies. Villeneuve's supply situation began to improve in October, but news of Nelson's arrival made Villeneuve reluctant to leave port. Indeed, his captains had held a vote on the matter and decided to stay in harbour.\n\nOn 16 September, Napoleon gave orders for the French and Spanish ships at C\u00e1diz to put to sea at the first favourable opportunity, join with seven Spanish ships of the line then at [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], go to [[Naples]] and land the soldiers they carried to reinforce his troops there, then fight decisively if they met a numerically inferior British fleet.\n\n==The fleets==\n{{broader|Order of battle at the Battle of Trafalgar}}\n\n===British===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"2\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px;\"\n|-\n!\n!British\n!Franco-Spanish\n|-\n|First rates\n|3\n|4\n|-\n|Second rates\n|4\n|0\n|-\n|Third rates\n|20\n|29\n|-\n|Total ships of the line\n|27\n|33\n|-\n|Other ships\n|6\n|7\n|}\n\nOn 21 October, Admiral Nelson had 27 ships of the line under his command. Nelson's flagship, [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']], captained by [[Thomas Masterman Hardy]], was one of three 100-gun [[First-rate|first rates]] in his fleet. He also had four 98-gun [[Second-rate|second rates]] and 20 [[Third-rate|third rates]]. One of the third rates was an 80-gun vessel, and 16 were 74-gun vessels. The remaining three were 64-gun ships, which were being phased out of the Royal Navy at the time of the battle. Nelson also had four frigates of 38 or 36 guns, a 12-gun [[schooner]] and a 10-gun [[cutter (boat)|cutter]].\n\n===Franco-Spanish===\nAgainst Nelson, Vice-Admiral Villeneuve, sailing on his flagship ''Bucentaure'', fielded 33 ships of the line, including some of the largest in the world at the time. The Spanish contributed four first-rates to the fleet. Three of these ships, one at 130 guns ([[Spanish ship Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad|''Santisima Trinidad'']]) and two at 112 guns (''Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias'', ''Santa Ana''), were much larger than anything under Nelson's command. The fourth first-rate carried 100 guns. The fleet had six 80-gun third-rates, (four French and two Spanish), and one Spanish 64-gun third-rate. The remaining 22 third-rates were 74-gun vessels, of which 14 were French and eight Spanish. In total, the Spanish contributed 15 ships of the line and the French 18. The fleet also included five 40-gun frigates and two 18-gun [[brig]]s, all French.\n\n==The battle==\n\n===Nelson's plan===\nThe prevailing tactical orthodoxy at the time involved manoeuvring to approach the enemy fleet in a single [[line of battle]] and then engaging broadside in parallel lines.<ref name=FB07P66>Fremont-Barnes (2007) p. 66</ref> In previous times, fleets had usually engaged in a mixed m\u00eal\u00e9e of chaotic one-on-one battles. One reason for the development of the line of battle system was to facilitate control of the fleet: if all the ships were in line, signalling in battle became possible.<ref>Ireland (2000) p. 52</ref> The line also allowed either side to disengage by breaking away in formation; if the attacker chose to continue, their line would be broken as well.<ref name=FB07P66/> This often led to inconclusive battles, or allowed the losing side to minimise its losses; but Nelson wanted a conclusive action, giving his well-trained crews a chance to fight ship to ship.<ref>Best (2005) p. 154</ref>\n\nNelson's solution to the problem was to cut the opposing line in three. Approaching in two columns, sailing perpendicular to the enemy's line, one towards the centre of the opposing line and one towards the trailing end, his ships would surround the middle third, and force them to fight to the end.<ref name=Best182>Best (2005) p. 182</ref> Nelson hoped specifically to cut the line just in front of the French flagship, ''Bucentaure''; the isolated ships in front of the break would not be able to see the flagship's signals, which he hoped would take them out of combat while they re-formed. This echoed the [[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|tactics]] used by [[Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan|Admiral Duncan]] at the [[Battle of Camperdown]] and [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Admiral Jervis]] at the [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]], both in 1797.<ref name=NE238>White (2002) p. 238</ref>\n\n[[File:The Battle of Trafalgar by William Clarkson Stanfield.jpg|thumb|''The Battle of Trafalgar'' by [[Clarkson Stanfield]]]]\n\nThe plan had three principal advantages. First, the British fleet would close with the Franco-Spanish as quickly as possible, preventing their escape.<ref name=NTA174>White (2005) p. 174</ref> Second, it would quickly bring on a m\u00eal\u00e9e and frantic battle by breaking the Franco-Spanish line and inducing a series of individual ship-to-ship actions, in which the British were likely to prevail. Nelson knew that the superior seamanship, faster gunnery and better morale of his crews were great advantages.<ref name=NTA173>White (2005) p. 173</ref> Third, it would bring a decisive concentration on the rear of the Franco-Spanish fleet. The ships in the [[Vanguard|van]] of the enemy fleet would have to turn back to support the rear, which would take a long time.<ref name=Best182/> Additionally, once the Franco-Spanish line had been broken, their ships would be relatively defenceless against powerful broadsides from the British fleet, and it would take them a long time to reposition to return fire.\n\nThe main drawback of attacking head-on was that as the leading British ships approached, the Franco-Spanish Combined Fleet would be able to direct [[raking fire|raking]] [[broadside]] fire at their bows, to which they would be unable to reply. To lessen the time the fleet was exposed to this danger, Nelson had his ships make all available sail (including [[Studding sail|stunsails]]), yet another departure from the norm.<ref name=NB215>Tracy (2008) p. 215</ref> He was also well aware that French and Spanish gunners were ill-trained and would have difficulty firing accurately from a moving gun platform. The Combined Fleet was sailing across a heavy [[Swell (ocean)|swell]], causing the ships to roll heavily and exacerbating the problem. Nelson's plan was indeed a gamble, but a carefully calculated one.<ref name=HOV266>Willis (2013) p. 266</ref>\n\nDuring the period of blockade off the coast of Spain in October, Nelson instructed his captains, over two dinners aboard ''Victory'', on his plan for the approaching battle. The order of sailing, in which the fleet was arranged when the enemy was first sighted, was to be the order of the ensuing action so that no time would be wasted in forming two lines.<ref name=NE239>White (2002) p. 239</ref> The first, led by his second-in-command Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]], was to sail into the rear of the enemy line, while the other, led by Nelson, was to sail into the centre and vanguard.<ref name=NTA174/> In preparation for the battle, Nelson ordered the ships of his fleet to be painted in a distinctive yellow and black pattern (later known as the [[Nelson Chequer]]) that would make them easy to distinguish from their opponents.<ref>Best (2005) pp. 182\u201383</ref>\n\nNelson was careful to point out that something had to be left to chance. Nothing is sure in a sea battle, so he left his captains free from all hampering rules by telling them that \"No captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of the enemy.\"<ref name=NE238/> In short, [[emergence|circumstances]]<!-- so while Nelson had a top-level plan, he allowed for considerable [[emergence]] to occur in action to strengthen his potential outcomes; in system theory also known as [[Bottom-up design]] --> would dictate the execution, subject to the guiding rule that the enemy's rear was to be cut off and superior force concentrated on that part of the enemy's line.\n\nAdmiral Villeneuve himself expressed his belief that Nelson would use some sort of unorthodox attack, presciently speculating that Nelson would drive right at his line. But his long game of [[cat and mouse]] with Nelson had worn him down, and he was suffering from a loss of nerve. Fearing that his inexperienced officers would be unable to maintain formation in more than one group, he chose keep the single line that became Nelson's target.<ref>Stilwell (Ed.) (2005) pp. 115\u201316</ref>\n\n===Departure===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--many paragraphs have no citations-->\nThe Combined Fleet of French and Spanish warships anchored in C\u00e1diz under the leadership of Admiral Villeneuve was in disarray. On 16 September 1805 Villeneuve received orders from Napoleon to sail the Combined Fleet from C\u00e1diz to Naples. At first, Villeneuve was optimistic about returning to the Mediterranean, but soon had second thoughts. A war council was held aboard his flagship, ''[[French ship Bucentaure (1803)|Bucentaure]]'', on 8 October.<ref name=NB178>Best (2005) p. 178</ref> While some of the French captains wished to obey Napoleon's orders, the Spanish captains and other French officers, including Villeneuve, thought it best to remain in C\u00e1diz.<ref name=NB179>Best (2005) p. 179</ref> Villeneuve changed his mind yet again on 18 October 1805, ordering the Combined Fleet to sail immediately even though there were only very light winds.<ref>{{harvnb|Schom|1990|pp=301\u201306}}.</ref>\n\nThe sudden change was prompted by a letter Villeneuve had received on 18 October, informing him that Vice-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Rosily]] had arrived in [[Madrid]] with orders to take command of the Combined Fleet.<ref>Lee (2005) pp. 289\u201390</ref> Stung by the prospect of being disgraced before the fleet, Villeneuve resolved to go to sea before his successor could reach C\u00e1diz. At the same time, he received intelligence that a detachment of six British ships (Admiral Louis' squadron), had docked at Gibraltar, thus weakening the British fleet. This was used as the pretext for sudden change.\n\nThe weather, however, suddenly turned calm following a week of gales. This slowed the progress of the fleet leaving the harbour, giving the British plenty of warning. Villeneuve had drawn up plans to form a force of four squadrons, each containing both French and Spanish ships. Following their earlier vote on 8 October to stay put, some captains were reluctant to leave C\u00e1diz, and as a result they failed to follow Villeneuve's orders closely and the fleet straggled out of the harbour in no particular formation.\n\nIt took most of 20 October for Villeneuve to get his fleet organised; it eventually set sail in three columns for the Straits of Gibraltar to the southeast. That same evening, ''[[French ship Achille (1803)|Achille]]'' spotted a force of 18 British ships of the line in pursuit. The fleet began to prepare for battle and during the night, they were ordered into a single line. The following day, Nelson's fleet of 27 ships of the line and four frigates was spotted in pursuit from the northwest with the wind behind it. Villeneuve again ordered his fleet into three columns, but soon changed his mind and restored a single line. The result was a sprawling, uneven formation.\n\nAt 5:40&nbsp;a.m. on 21 October, the British were about 21&nbsp;miles <!-- nautical (which nautical?) or statute? --> (34&nbsp;km) to the northwest of Cape Trafalgar, with the Franco-Spanish fleet between the British and the Cape. About 6&nbsp;a.m., Nelson gave the order to prepare for battle.<ref>Signal log of HMS ''Bellerophon'', 21 October 1805</ref> At 8&nbsp;a.m., the British frigate ''Euryalus'', which had been keeping watch on the Combined Fleet overnight, observed the British fleet still \"forming the lines\" in which it would attack.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Battle of Trafalgar: The Logbook of the Euryalus, 21st October 1805|url=http://chasingnelson.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/the-battle-of-trafalgar-logbook-of_22.html|website=chasingnelson.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate=11 June 2017|date=22 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt 8&nbsp;a.m., Villeneuve ordered the fleet to ''wear together'' (turn about) and return to C\u00e1diz. This reversed the order of the allied line, placing the rear division under Rear-Admiral [[Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley]] in the vanguard. The wind became contrary at this point, often shifting direction. The very light wind rendered manoeuvring virtually impossible for all but the most expert seamen. The inexperienced crews had difficulty with the changing conditions, and it took nearly an hour and a half for Villeneuve's order to be completed. The French and Spanish fleet now formed an uneven, angular crescent, with the slower ships generally to [[leeward]] and closer to the shore.\n\nBy 11&nbsp;a.m. Nelson's entire fleet was visible to Villeneuve, drawn up in two parallel columns. The two fleets would be within range of each other within an hour. Villeneuve was concerned at this point about forming up a line, as his ships were unevenly spaced in an irregular formation drawn out nearly five miles <!-- nautical (which nautical?) or statute? -->(8&nbsp;km) long as Nelson's fleet approached.\n\nAs the British drew closer, they could see that the enemy was not sailing in a tight order, but in irregular groups. Nelson could not immediately make out the French flagship as the French and Spanish were not flying command pennants.\n\nNelson was outnumbered and outgunned, the enemy totalling nearly 30,000 men and 2,568 guns to his 17,000 men and 2,148 guns. The Franco-Spanish fleet also had six more ships of the line, and so could more readily combine their fire. There was no way for some of Nelson's ships to avoid being \"doubled on\" or even \"trebled on\".\n\nAs the two fleets drew closer, anxiety began to build among officers and sailors; one British sailor described the approach thus: \"During this momentous preparation, the human mind had ample time for meditation, for it was evident that the fate of England rested on this battle\".<ref name=\"Adkins, Roy 2004\">{{harvnb|Adkins|2004a|p={{page needed|date=February 2012}}}}.</ref>\n\n===Battle===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--many paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:England expects...retouched.jpg|thumb|Nelson's signal, \"[[England expects that every man will do his duty]]\", flying from ''Victory'' on the bicentenary of the Battle of Trafalgar]]\n[[File:England Expects Signal.svg|thumb|Nelson's signal.<ref name=SignalWasFamous/>]]\n\nThe battle progressed largely according to Nelson's plan.

Unlike the photographic depiction (right), this signal would have been shown on the [[mizzen]] mast only and would have required 12 lifts.\n\nAs the battle opened, the French and Spanish were in a ragged curved line headed north. As planned, the British fleet was approaching the Franco-Spanish line in two columns. Leading the northern, [[windward and leeward|windward]] column in ''Victory'' was Nelson, while Collingwood in the 100-gun [[HMS Royal Sovereign (1786)|''Royal Sovereign'']] led the second, leeward, column. The two British columns approached from the west at nearly a right angle to the allied line. Nelson led his column into a feint toward the van of the Franco-Spanish fleet and then abruptly turned toward the actual point of attack. Collingwood altered the course of his column slightly so that the two lines converged at this line of attack.\n\n[[File:Trafalgar-Auguste Mayer.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's conception of [[HMS Sandwich (1759)|HMS ''Sandwich'']] fighting the French [[flagship]] ''[[French ship Bucentaure (1803)|Bucentaure]]'' (completely dismasted) at Trafalgar.

At 12:45, ''Victory'' cut the enemy line between Villeneuve's flagship ''Bucentaure'' and ''Redoutable''; she came close to ''Bucentaure'', firing a devastating raking broadside through ''Bucentaure''<nowiki/>'s stern which killed and wounded many on her gundecks. Villeneuve thought that boarding would take place, and with the [[French Imperial Eagle|Eagle]] of his ship in hand, told his men, \"I will throw it onto the enemy ship and we will take it back there!\" However ''Victory'' engaged the 74-gun ''Redoutable''; ''Bucentaure'' was left to  the next three ships of the British windward column: [[HMS Temeraire (1798)|''Temeraire'']], [[HMS Conqueror (1801)|''Conqueror'']], and {{HMS|Neptune|1797|6}}.\n\n[[File:Fall of Nelson.jpg|thumb|left|Painter Denis Dighton's imagining of Nelson being shot on the quarterdeck of ''Victory'']]\nA general m\u00eal\u00e9e ensued.

As the French were preparing to board ''Victory'', ''Temeraire'', the second ship in the British windward column, approached from the starboard bow of ''Redoutable'' and fired on the exposed French crew with a [[carronade]], causing many casualties.\n\nAt 13:55, the French [[Jean Jacques Etienne Lucas|Captain Lucas]] of ''Redoutable'', with 99 fit men out of 643 and severely wounded himself, surrendered. The French ''Bucentaure'' was isolated by ''Victory'' and ''Temeraire'', and then engaged by HMS ''Neptune'', {{HMS|Leviathan|1790|6}}, and ''Conqueror''; similarly, ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'' was isolated and overwhelmed, surrendering after three hours.\n\n[[File:Trafalgar2.jpg|thumb|left|Painter Nicholas Pocock's conception of the situation at 1700h]]\n\nAs more and more British ships entered the battle, the ships of the allied centre and rear were gradually overwhelmed. The allied van, after long remaining quiescent, made a futile demonstration and then sailed away. The British took 22 vessels of the Franco-Spanish fleet and lost none. Among the captured French ships were ''L'Aigle'', [[French ship Alg\u00e9siras (1804)|''Alg\u00e9siras'']], {{HMS|Berwick|1775|2}}, ''Bucentaure'', ''Fougueux'', [[French ship Intr\u00e9pide|''Intr\u00e9pide'']], ''Redoutable'', and [[French ship Swiftsure|''Swiftsure'']]. The Spanish ships taken were ''Argonauta'', ''Bahama'', ''Monarca'', ''Neptuno'', [[Spanish ship San Agust\u00edn|''San Agust\u00edn'']], ''San Ildefonso'', [[Spanish ship San Juan Nepomuceno|''San Juan Nepomuceno'']], [[Spanish ship Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad (1769)|''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'']], and ''Santa Ana''. Of these, ''Redoutable'' sank, and ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'' and ''Argonauta'' were scuttled by the British. ''Achille'' exploded, ''Intr\u00e9pide'' and ''San August\u00edn'' burned, and ''L'Aigle'', ''Berwick'', ''Fougueux'', and ''Monarca'' were wrecked in a gale following the battle.\n\nAs Nelson lay dying, he ordered the fleet to anchor, as a storm was predicted. However, when the storm blew up, many of the severely damaged ships sank or ran aground on the [[shoals]]. A few of them were recaptured, some by the French and Spanish prisoners overcoming the small prize crews, others by ships sallying from C\u00e1diz. Surgeon [[William Beatty (surgeon)|William Beatty]] heard Nelson murmur, \"Thank God I have done my duty\"; when he returned, Nelson's voice had faded, and his pulse was very weak.<ref name=\"Hibbert 376\">{{harvnb| Hibbert|1994|p=376}}.</ref> He looked up as Beatty took his pulse, then closed his eyes.

Nelson died at half-past four, three hours after being hit.<ref name=\"Hibbert 376\"/>\n\nTowards the end of the battle, and with the combined fleet being overwhelmed, the still relatively un-engaged portion of the van under Rear-Admiral Dumanoir Le Pelley tried to come to the assistance of the collapsing centre. After failing to fight his way through, he decided to break off the engagement, and led four French ships, his flagship the 80-gun [[French ship Formidable (1795)|''Formidable'']], the 74-gun ships [[French ship Scipion (1798)|''Scipion'']], [[French ship Duguay Trouin (1797)|''Duguay Trouin'']] and [[French ship Mont-Blanc (1791)|''Mont Blanc'']] away from the fighting.

With a storm gathering in strength off the Spanish coast, he sailed westwards to clear [[Cape St Vincent]], prior to heading north-west, swinging eastwards across the [[Bay of Biscay]], and aiming to reach the French port at [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]].<ref name=\"Adkin530\"/> These four ships remained at large until their encounter with and attempt to chase a British frigate brought them in range of a British squadron under [[Sir Richard Strachan, 6th Baronet|Sir Richard Strachan]], which captured them all on 4 November 1805 at the [[Battle of Cape Ortegal]].<ref name=\"Adkin530\"/>\n\n====Cosmao and MacDonnell sortie====\n[[File:Trafalgar, ships scattered.jpg|thumb|The gale after Trafalgar, depicted by [[Thomas Buttersworth]].

Cosmao claimed in his report that the rescue plan was entirely his idea, but Vice-Admiral Escano recorded a meeting of Spanish and French commodores at which a planned rescue was discussed and agreed upon.

The combined squadron came in sight at noon, causing Collingwood to summon his most battle-ready ships to meet the threat. In doing so, he ordered them to cast off towing their prizes.

''Rayo'', an old three-decker with more than 50 years of service, anchored off [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda|Sanl\u00facar]], a few [[league (unit)|leagues]] to the northwest of Rota. There, she lost her masts, already damaged in the battle.<ref name=\"James-p362\"/> Heartened by the approach of the squadron, the French crew of the former flagship ''Bucentaure'' also rose up and retook the ship from the British prize crew but she was wrecked later on 23 October. ''[[French ship Aigle (1800)|Aigle]]'' escaped from the British ship [[HMS Defiance (1783)|HMS ''Defiance'']], but was wrecked off the [[El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda|Port of Santa Mar\u00eda]] on 23 October; while the French prisoners on ''Berwick'' cut the tow cables, but caused her to founder off Sanl\u00facar on 22 October.

On boarding her, her British captors found that she was in a sinking state, and so removed the British prize crew, and nearly all of her original Spanish crew members. The nearly empty ''Monarca'' parted her cable and was wrecked during the night. Despite the efforts of her British prize crew, ''Rayo'' was driven onshore on 26 October and wrecked, with the loss of 25 men.

In forcing the British to suspend their repairs to defend themselves, it influenced Collingwood's decision to sink or set fire to the most damaged of his remaining prizes.<ref name=\"Yonge-p336\" /> Cosmao retook two Spanish ships of the line, but it cost him one French and two Spanish vessels to do so.

British prize crews were captured and given good treatment. On 27 October, Collingwood offered the governor of C\u00e1diz to put his Spanish wounded prisoners ashore and set them free. The governor and Gravina offered in exchange to release their British prisoners, who boarded the British fleet. The French would later join this humanitarian agreement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://abcblogs.abc.es/espejo-de-navegantes/2015/10/20/el-epilogo-de-trafalgar/|title=El ep\u00edlogo de Trafalgar|last=Rodr\u00edguez Gonz\u00e1lez|first=Agust\u00edn Ram\u00f3n|date=2015-10-20|work=Espejo de navegantes|access-date=2018-10-21|language=es-ES}}</ref>\n\nThe disparity in losses has been attributed by some historians less to Nelson's daring tactics than to the difference in fighting readiness of the two fleets.{{sfn|Nicolson|2005|p=9\u201310}} Nelson's fleet was made up of ships of the line which had spent a considerable amount of sea time during the months of blockades of French ports, whilst the French fleet had generally been at anchor in port. However, Villeneuve's fleet had just spent months at sea crossing the Atlantic twice, which supports the proposition that the main difference between the two fleets' combat effectiveness was the morale of the leaders. The daring tactics employed by Nelson were to ensure a strategically decisive result. The results vindicated his naval judgement.\n\n==Results of the battle==\n[[File:MuseoNaval Hispalois bajas espa\u00f1olas batalla Trafalgar.jpg|thumb|Report of Spanish losses in the combat of 21 October.]]\n\nWhen Rosily arrived in C\u00e1diz, he found only five French ships, rather than the 18 he was expecting. The surviving ships remained bottled up in C\u00e1diz until 1808 when Napoleon invaded Spain. The French ships were then [[Capture of Rosily Squadron|seized by the Spanish forces]] and put into service against France.\n\nHMS ''Victory'' made her way to Gibraltar for repairs, carrying Nelson's body. She put into Rosia Bay, Gibraltar and after emergency repairs were carried out, returned to Britain. Many of the injured crew were taken ashore at Gibraltar and treated in the Naval Hospital. Men who subsequently died from injuries sustained at the battle are buried in or near the [[Trafalgar Cemetery]], at the south end of [[Main Street, Gibraltar]].\n\nOne [[Royal Marine]] officer was killed on board ''Victory''; Captain Charles Adair.

Less than two months later, Napoleon decisively defeated the Third Coalition at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], knocking Austria out of the war and forcing the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Although Trafalgar meant France could no longer challenge Britain at sea, Napoleon proceeded to establish the [[Continental System]] in an attempt to deny Britain trade with the continent.

Napoleon had already abandoned his plans of invasion before the battle and they were never revived. The battle did not mean, however, that the French naval challenge to Britain was over. First, as the French control over the continent expanded, Britain had to take active steps with the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Battle of Copenhagen]] in 1807 and elsewhere in 1808 to prevent the ships of smaller European navies from falling into French hands. This effort was largely successful, but did not end the French threat as Napoleon instituted a large-scale shipbuilding programme that had produced a fleet of 80 ships of the line at the time of his fall from power in 1814, with more under construction. In comparison, Britain had 99 ships of the line in active commission in 1814, and this was close to the maximum that could be supported. Given a few more years, the French could have realised their plans to commission 150 ships of the line and again challenge the Royal Navy, compensating for the inferiority of their crews with sheer numbers.<ref name=\"glover\">{{harvnb|Glover|1967|pp=233\u201352}}.</ref> For almost 10&nbsp;years after Trafalgar, the Royal Navy maintained a close blockade of French bases and anxiously observed the growth of the French fleet.

In the evening a symbolic re-enactment of the battle was staged with fireworks and various small ships playing parts in the battle.\n\nLieutenant [[John Richards Lapenoti\u00e8re|John Lapenoti\u00e8re]]'s historic voyage in [[HMS Pickle (1800)|HMS ''Pickle'']] bringing the news of the victory from the fleet to [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] and thence by [[post chaise]] to the [[Admiralty]] in London was commemorated by the inauguration of [[The Trafalgar Way]] and further highlighted by the [[New Trafalgar Dispatch]] celebrations from July to September in which an actor played the part of Lapenoti\u00e8re and re-enacted parts of the historic journey.\n\nOn the actual anniversary day, 21 October, naval manoeuvres were conducted in Trafalgar Bay near C\u00e1diz involving a combined fleet from Britain, Spain, and France. Many descendants of people present at the battle, including members of Nelson's family, were at the ceremony.{{sfn|Elmundo staff|2005}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Turner, The Battle of Trafalgar (1822).jpg|thumb|''[[The Battle of Trafalgar (painting)|The Battle of Trafalgar]]'' by [[J. M. W. Turner]] (oil on canvas, 1822\u20131824) combines events from several moments during the battle]]\n\n===Novels===\n* [[The Knight of Sainte-Hermine|''Le Chevalier de Sainte-Hermine'']] (1869), by [[Alexandre Dumas]], is an adventure story in which the main character is alleged to be the one who shot Nelson.\n* ''Trafalgar'' (1873), a Spanish novel about the battle, written by [[Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s]]. It is a fictional account of a boy aboard the Santa Ana.\n* In [[James Clavell]]'s 1966 novel ''[[Tai-Pan (novel)|Tai-Pan]]'', the Scots chieftain of Hong Kong, Dirk Struan, reflects on his experiences as a [[powder monkey]] on board HMS ''Royal Sovereign'' at Trafalgar.\n* In the unfinished novel ''[[Hornblower and the Crisis]]'' (1967) in the [[Horatio Hornblower]] series by [[C. S. Forester]], Hornblower was to deliver false orders to Villeneuve causing him to send his fleet out of C\u00e1diz and hence fight the battle. In ''Hornblower and the Atropos'' (1953), Hornblower is put in charge of Admiral Nelson's funeral in London.\n* In ''Ramage at Trafalgar'' (1986), by [[Dudley Pope]], [[Lord Ramage|Ramage]] commands the fictitious [[frigate]] HMS ''Calypso'' which is a attached to Nelson's fleet.\n* In ''[[Sharpe's Trafalgar]]'' (2000), by [[Bernard Cornwell]], Sharpe finds himself at the battle aboard the fictitious HMS ''Pucelle''.\n* In the 2006 novel ''[[His Majesty's Dragon]]'', the first of the historical fantasy [[Temeraire (series)|''Temeraire'' series]] by [[Naomi Novik]], in which aerial [[dragon]]-mounted combat units form major divisions of European militaries during the Napoleonic Wars, Trafalgar is actually a massive feint by Napoleon to distract British forces away from the aerial and seaborne invasion of Britain near [[Dover]]. Nelson survives, though he is burned by dragon fire.\n\n===In other media===\n* ''The Battle of Trafalgar'' is a 1911 silent short film directed by [[J. Searle Dawley]].\n* [[Jonathan Willcocks]] composed a major choral work, \"A Great and Glorious Victory\", to mark the bicentenary of the battle in October 2005.\n* The BBC marked the bicentenary with ''Nelson's Trafalgar'', a 2005 vivid drama-documentary which took full advantage of the computer generated effects of the time.  Presented by Michael Portillo, the two-disc DVD version is still available at 2020 and runs 76 minutes plus extras. Portillo later revisited the format and the event, presenting the BBC's 2019 drama-documentary ''The HMS Victory Story''.\n* ''Admiral over the Oceans'' is a song composed by Swedish [[Power Metal]] band, Civil War, detailing the battle from the point of view of a sailor and from Nelson himself.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France|War}}\n* [[List of Royal Navy ships]]\n* [[List of early warships of the English navy]]\n* [[List of ships captured in the 19th century#Battle of Trafalgar|List of ships captured at the Battle of Trafalgar]]\n* [[Bibliography of 18th-19th century Royal Naval history]]\n* [[Trafalgar Day]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite web|ref=harv |author=ACS staff|year=2009 |title=Battle of Trafalgar \u2013 propaganda|url=http://www.aandc.org/research/trafalgar_propaganda.html |publisher=The Archives and Collections Society |accessdate=15 March 2009}}\n* {{Cite book |ref=harv |last=Adkin |first=Mark |year=2005 |title=The Trafalgar Companion: A Guide to History's Most Famous Sea Battle and the Life of Admiral Lord Nelson |location=London |publisher=Aurum Press |isbn=1-84513-018-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/trafalgarcompani0000adki }}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv |last=Adkins|first=Roy|year=2004|title=Trafalgar: The Biography of a Battle|publisher=Little Brown|isbn=0-316-72511-0 }}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv |last=Adkins|first=Roy|title=Nelson's Trafalgar|edition= 1st|location=London|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2004a |isbn=9780143037958}}\n* {{cite book|title=The War For All The World's Oceans|last=Adkins|first=Roy|authorlink=|author2=Adkins Lesley|year=2006|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|location=Lancaster Place, London.|isbn=0-316-72837-3|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/warforalloceansf0000adki_f2i1}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv |last=Allen|first=Joseph|year=1853|title=Life of Lord Viscount Nelson|publisher=George Routledge|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4EEBAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA210 210]}}\n* {{cite book |first1=Nicholas |last1=Best |titlelink1= |others= |title=Trafalgar|origyear=2005 |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |location=London |year=2005 |language= |isbn=0 297 84622 1}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Corbett |year=1919|first=By Sir Julian Stafford|title=The campaign of Trafalgar|volume=2|publisher=Longmans, Green, and company|page=538}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=NG66mfh6l7kC Url]\n* {{cite web|ref=harv|last=Cowan|first=Veronica|date= 21 December 2005|url=http://www.c.org.uk/history+%26+heritage/war+%26+conflict/pre%2d20th+century+conflict/art32693|title=First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Alan West on Trafalgar 2005|publisher=[[Culture24]]|accessdate=1 February 2012}}\n* {{cite web|ref=harv|author=Elmundo staff|date=21 October 2005\n|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/10/21/espana/1129885217.html|title=Los pa\u00edses que combatieron en Trafalgar homenajean a sus ca\u00eddos en el 200 aniversario de la batalla (Countries that fought at Trafalgar pay tribute to their fallen on the 200th anniversary of the battle)|publisher=Elmundo.es|language=es}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Fraser |first=Edward |year=1906|title=The enemy at Trafalgar: ...|location=New York|publisher=E.P.Dutton & Co.|pages= 114, 211\u201313, 436}} [https://archive.org/details/enemyattrafalgar00frasrich Url]\n* {{cite book|last = Fremont-Barnes|first = Gregory|year = 2007|origyear= 2007|title = The Royal Navy, 1793\u20131815|publisher = Osprey Publishing|location = Oxford|isbn =978 1 84603 138 0}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Fremont-Barnes|first=Gregory|year=2005 |others=Hook, Christa (Illust.) |title = Trafalgar 1805: Nelson's Crowning Victory|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn = 1-84176-892-8}}\n* {{Cite journal|ref=harv|first=Richard|last=Glover|title=The French Fleet, 1807\u20131814;
