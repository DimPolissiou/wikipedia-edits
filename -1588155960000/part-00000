It is the northernmost coastal town in Angus and developed as a natural harbour that traded in skins, hides and cured salmon in medieval times.\n\nWith a population of approximately 12,000, the town functions as a port, but the major employer is [[GlaxoSmithKline]], which was saved from closure in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contractorsunlimited.co.uk/news/060406-glaxosmithkline.shtml|title=GlaxoSmithKline - Montrose Plant|author=|date=|website=www.contractorsunlimited.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> The skyline of Montrose is dominated by the {{convert|220|ft|m|adj=on}} [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]] of [[Montrose Old and St Andrew's Church|Old and St Andrew's Church]], designed by [[James Gillespie Graham]] and built between 1832 and 1834.\n\nMontrose is a town with a wealth of architecture, and is a centre for international trade.

The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

The Asylum, initially called Montrose Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary  was founded by Susan Carnegie of Charleton to treat both paupers and private patients and was originally situated on Montrose Links. It was granted a Royal Charter in 1810. In 1858 it moved to Sunnyside farm at the nearby village of Hillside. Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962.

As well as a training base Montrose was also an operational airfield for [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons, which flew sorties over [[Norway]] and were a part of the air defences for [[Edinburgh]]. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion. Despite its coastal location presenting a danger however, large numbers of children and young mothers from [[Dundee]] were evacuated there during the period of the [[Phoney War]].

He saved the life of Lieutenant Commander Olav Nilsen at Dundee Docks and generally protected his fellow sailors. In stories Bamse is said to have got up on his hind legs and, at over {{convert|6|ft}} tall, clamped his great paws on assailants to end any fight. On his death in July 1944 Montrose schools were closed and 800 children lined the route to his graveside funeral.\n\nThe Bamse Project raised \u00a350,000 to erect a larger than life-size bronze statue of Bamse at Montrose Harbour.

Andy Burnham]</ref> One ancient name for Montrose was Celurca.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p1</ref> Early place names appear to show the presence of a [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement in the area of the present harbour. The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

Biometric options include an optical (under-screen) fingerprint sensor and facial recognition. \n\n====Camera====\nThe camera system has been changed to further differentiate the 8 and 8 Pro. The 8's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 16 MP ultrawide sensor, and a 2 MP macro sensor, while the 8 Pro's camera array consists of a 48 MP wide sensor, a 48 MP ultrawide sensor and an 8 MP telephoto sensor, with an additional 5 MP \"Color Filter Camera\" that enables one- or two- color filters within the standard shooting mode. The 8's wide sensor is the same as on the 7T series, the Sony IMX586, while the 8 Pro's wide sensor is the newer Sony IMX689. Unlike the 7T, the 8 does not have a telephoto camera or autofocus on the ultrawide camera, which are now exclusive to the 8 Pro.

Berkman also iterates that we often check our smartphones to relieve the social pressure we place upon ourselves to never miss out on exciting things. As Berkman says, \u201cSmartphones can be an escape from boredom because they are a window into many worlds other than the one right in front of you,\u201d helping us feel included and involved in society.<ref name=\"Baral\"/> When we do not check our mobile phones, we are unable to satisfy this \u201ccheck habit\u201d or suppress the [[fear of missing out]]''',''' leading us to feel anxious and irritable.

People have become so addicted to their phones that they are almost dependent on them. Humans are not meant to be constantly staring at a screen as time is needed to relax their eyes and more importantly their minds. Colier states: \"Without open spaces and downtime, the nervous system never shuts down\u2014it's in constant fight-or-flight mode. We're wired and tired all the time. Even computers reboot, but we\u2019re not doing it.\"<ref name=\"Colier\" />\n\nThe amount of time spent on screens appears to have a correlation with happiness levels. A nationally representative study of American 12th graders funded by the ''National Institute on Drug Abuse''  titled ''Monitoring the Future Survey'' found that \u201cteens who spent more time than average on screen activities are more likely to be unhappy, and those who spend more time than average on non screen activities are more likely to be happy.'''\u201d''' One of the most important findings of this study is how the amount of time spent on non screen activities versus on screen activities affects the happiness levels of teenagers.<ref name=Atl/>\n\nHowever, while it is easy to see a correlation between cell phone overuse and these symptoms of depression, anxiety, and isolation, it is much harder to prove that cell phones themselves cause these issues. Studies of correlations cannot prove causation because there are multiple other factors that increase depression in people today. Although parents and other figures share these concerns, according to Peter Etchells, a psychologist at Bath Spa University in England, other possible variables must be reviewed as well. Etchells proposes two possible alternative theories: depression could cause teens to use iPhones more or teens could be more open to discussing the topic of depression in this day and age.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/apple-investors-iphone-kids-depression-suicide-evidence|title=Apple investors say iPhones cause teen depression.

Although brief, one driving at 55&nbsp;mph can travel the length of a football field in that time. Approximately three percent of drivers are talking on the phone when stopped at an intersection. Furthermore, five percent of drivers are on the phone at any given time. The Insurance Institute of Highway Safety (IIHS) reported those who used cell phones more often tended to brake harder, drive faster, and change lanes more frequently, predisposing them to crashes and near-crashes. They are also two to six times more likely to get into an accident.\n\nResearch indicates driver performance is adversely affected by concurrent cell phone use, delaying reaction time and increasing lane deviations and length of time with eyes off the road. It can also cause \"inattention blindness,\" in which drivers see but do not register what is in front of them.\n\nTeen drivers are especially at risk. About 1.2 million and 341,000 crashes in 2013 involved talking and texting, respectively. Distractions such as music, games, GPS, social media, etc., are potentially deadly when combined with inexperience. The dangers of driving and multitasking continue to rise as more technology is integrated into cars. Teens who texted more frequently were less likely to wear a seat belt and more likely to drive intoxicated or ride with a drunk driver. Cell phone use can reduce brain activity as much as 37%, affecting young drivers' abilities to control their vehicles, pay attention to the roadway, and respond promptly to traffic events.\n\n==Tools to prevent or treat mobile phone overuse==\nThe following tools or interventions can be used to prevent or treat mobile phone overuse.\n\n=== Behavioral ===\nMany studies have found relationships between psychological or mental health issues and smartphone addiction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Samaha|first=Maya|last2=Hawi|first2=Nazir S.|date=2016|title=Relationships among smartphone addiction, stress, academic performance, and satisfaction with life|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=57|pages=321\u2013325|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2015.12.045 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bian|first=Mengwei|last2=Leung|first2=Louis|date=2014-04-08|title=Linking Loneliness, Shyness, Smartphone Addiction Symptoms, and Patterns of Smartphone Use to Social Capital|journal=Social Science Computer Review|volume=33|issue=1|pages=61\u201379|doi=10.1177/0894439314528779 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/865af4dc947260b1a98c83de0722c46f480b1a1f}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Yu-Hsuan|last2=Lin|first2=Yu-Cheng|last3=Lee|first3=Yang-Han|last4=Lin|first4=Po-Hsien|last5=Lin|first5=Sheng-Hsuan|last6=Chang|first6=Li-Ren|last7=Tseng|first7=Hsien-Wei|last8=Yen|first8=Liang-Yu|last9=Yang|first9=Cheryl C.H.|date=2015|title=Time distortion associated with smartphone addiction: Identifying smartphone addiction via a mobile application (App)|journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|volume=65|pages=139\u2013145|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2015.04.003|pmid=25935253 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Demirci|first=Kadir|last2=Akg\u00f6n\u00fcl|first2=Mehmet|last3=Akpinar|first3=Abdullah|date=2015|title=Relationship of smartphone use severity with sleep quality, depression, and anxiety in university students|journal= Journal of Behavioral Addictions|volume=4|issue=2|pages=85\u201392|doi=10.1556/2006.4.2015.010|pmid=26132913 |pmc=4500888}}</ref> Hence, behavioral interventions such as individual or family psychotherapy for these issues may help.

Users found interventions related to information, limit, and mindfulness to be the most useful.

Second, [[social isolation]] is the lack of interaction between individuals and society. If the communications are just done by the message on the phone, the conversation with face-to-face would no more happen and the offline real-life friends would not be made or resisted anymore. People might think they are happy and satisfying their life, however, only online. Therefore, they would end up people feel lonely and isolated from the world when they are in real life. Lastly, [[Self-esteem|low self-esteem]] and [[anxiety]] are a lack of confidence and feeling negative about oneself.

For example, if the person is diagnosed with depression, they start to compare themselves with others. They might think everyone expects him or herself is happy and lucky.

Furthermore, the person will remind their selves that they might fail in everything they try because they cannot succeed.\n\nTheir suicide rate rose by 65% in those five years and the number of girls with severe depression rose by 58%.

Furthermore, Phone addiction not only makes the people who are addicted to phone isolated but also makes the people around them feel isolated.\n\n== Low self-esteem and anxiety ==\nThe other psychological symptoms that are caused by phone addiction are self-esteem and anxiety. [[Social networking service|Social Network Service]] (SNS) is one of the main streams in the world these days, therefore it dissolved a lot in daily life too. Studies have consistently shown that there are significant relationships between high extraversion, high anxiety, and teenagers\u2019 low self-esteem with mobile phone, and the stronger the young person\u2019s mobile phone addiction, the more likely is that individual to have high mobile phone call time, and excessive number of calls and text messages.<ref name=\"Hong 2152\u20132159\"/> When we communicate with friends, we use SNS or message to contact.\n\nAnxious people more easily perceive certain normal life matters as pressure. To reduce this stress might result in even more addictive behaviors and females are more likely to use mobile phones to maintain social relations.<ref name=\"Hong 2152\u20132159\"/> When we see cool things or want to show something to others, we open our Snapchat, Instagram, or Twitter to post it. After, people check the reaction to their posts and care about likes, comments, and other\u2019s post, which decreases self-esteem. Furthermore, even we are with friends, we check our SNS updates instead of having a conversation. We reply to another friend\u2019s message even we are with other friend and check our phone even the notifications were not on. These connect to [[anxiety]]; caring other\u2019s reaction to show off themselves, checking phone frequently with no reason. In other words, it is called, \u201cForecast error\u201d that keeps us coming back, even though it often has a negative effect on our mental health. And this cycle sounds eerily like a classic addiction.\n\nMoreover, online, under the name anonymous, people utilize it in bad ways like the cyberbully or spread rumors. People also force their opinions and post bad comments that might hurt others too. All of these examples would result in people by having a symptom of anxiety and low self-esteem that connects to depression.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Telecommunication}}\n*[[Computer addiction]]\n*[[De Quervain syndrome]]\n*[[Digital detox]], a period of time during which a person refrains from using electronic connecting devices\n*[[Digital media use and mental health]]\n*[[Internet addiction disorder]]\n*{{Section link|Mobile phone|Health effects}}\n*[[Mobile phone radiation and health]]\n*[[Mobile phones and driving safety]]\n*[[Nomophobia]], a proposed name for the fear of being out of cellular phone contact\n*[[Smartphone zombie]]\n*[[Television addiction]]\n* [[Underearners Anonymous]]\n*[[Video game overuse]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |title=TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING: Are You Addicted to Your Smartphone? |publisher=Sentia Publishing |last=Roberts |first=James A. |year=2015 |isbn=978-0996300476}}\n* {{cite news|last=Richtel|first=Matt|title=It Don't Mean a Thing if You Ain't Got That Ping|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/weekinreview/22richtel.html|accessdate=3 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 April 2007}} {{open access}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Takao |first1=Motoharu |last2=Takahashi |first2=Susumu |last3=Kitamura |first3=Masayoshi |title=Addictive Personality and Problematic Mobile Phone Use |journal=CyberPsychology & Behavior |date=October 2009 |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=501\u2013507 |doi=10.1089/cpb.2009.0022 |pmid=19817562 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fea84a81afb30758b29218dd44e54762fa881cd4 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=S\u00e1nchez-Mart\u00ednez |first1=Mercedes |last2=Otero |first2=Angel |title=Factors Associated with Cell Phone Use in Adolescents in the Community of Madrid (Spain) |journal=CyberPsychology & Behavior |date=April 2009 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=131\u2013137 |doi=10.1089/cpb.2008.0164 |pmid=19072078 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3ac1971162d061f2e6da497d407cf65c80185c2c }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Griffiths |first1=Mark |title=Does Internet and Computer 'Addiction' Exist?

Berkman also iterates that we often check our smartphones to relieve the social pressure we place upon ourselves to never miss out on exciting things. As Berkman says, \u201cSmartphones can be an escape from boredom because they are a window into many worlds other than the one right in front of you,\u201d helping us feel included and involved in society.<ref name=\"Baral\"/> When we do not check our mobile phones, we are unable to satisfy this \u201ccheck habit\u201d or suppress the [[fear of missing out]]''',''' leading us to feel anxious and irritable.

Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University, there is a correlation between mobile phone overuse and depression.

People have become so addicted to their phones that they are almost dependent on them. Humans are not meant to be constantly staring at a screen as time is needed to relax their eyes and more importantly their minds. Colier states: \"Without open spaces and downtime, the nervous system never shuts down\u2014it's in constant fight-or-flight mode. We're wired and tired all the time. Even computers reboot, but we\u2019re not doing it.\"<ref name=\"Colier\" />\n\nThe amount of time spent on screens appears to have a correlation with happiness levels. A nationally representative study of American 12th graders funded by the ''National Institute on Drug Abuse''  titled ''Monitoring the Future Survey'' found that \u201cteens who spent more time than average on screen activities are more likely to be unhappy, and those who spend more time than average on non screen activities are more likely to be happy.'''\u201d''' One of the most important findings of this study is how the amount of time spent on non screen activities versus on screen activities affects the happiness levels of teenagers.<ref name=Atl/>\n\nHowever, while it is easy to see a correlation between cell phone overuse and these symptoms of depression, anxiety, and isolation, it is much harder to prove that cell phones themselves cause these issues. Studies of correlations cannot prove causation because there are multiple other factors that increase depression in people today. Although parents and other figures share these concerns, according to Peter Etchells, a psychologist at Bath Spa University in England, other possible variables must be reviewed as well. Etchells proposes two possible alternative theories: depression could cause teens to use iPhones more or teens could be more open to discussing the topic of depression in this day and age.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/apple-investors-iphone-kids-depression-suicide-evidence|title=Apple investors say iPhones cause teen depression.

Texting and driving is banned in most of the country; new drivers in 38 states and DC are not permitted to use cell phones behind the wheel. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA (which promotes safe driving through research and education), drivers between the ages of 16 and 24 were most distracted, with women at greater risk of dying in a crash. About 20,000 of motor vehicle fatalities between 2012 and 2017 were related to distracted driving.\n\nA text can take one's eyes off the road for an average of five seconds. Although brief, one driving at 55&nbsp;mph can travel the length of a football field in that time. Approximately three percent of drivers are talking on the phone when stopped at an intersection. Furthermore, five percent of drivers are on the phone at any given time. The Insurance Institute of Highway Safety (IIHS) reported those who used cell phones more often tended to brake harder, drive faster, and change lanes more frequently, predisposing them to crashes and near-crashes. They are also two to six times more likely to get into an accident.\n\nResearch indicates driver performance is adversely affected by concurrent cell phone use, delaying reaction time and increasing lane deviations and length of time with eyes off the road. It can also cause \"inattention blindness,\" in which drivers see but do not register what is in front of them.\n\nTeen drivers are especially at risk. About 1.2 million and 341,000 crashes in 2013 involved talking and texting, respectively. Distractions such as music, games, GPS, social media, etc., are potentially deadly when combined with inexperience. The dangers of driving and multitasking continue to rise as more technology is integrated into cars. Teens who texted more frequently were less likely to wear a seat belt and more likely to drive intoxicated or ride with a drunk driver.

Users found interventions related to information, limit, and mindfulness to be the most useful.

Second, [[social isolation]] is the lack of interaction between individuals and society. If the communications are just done by the message on the phone, the conversation with face-to-face would no more happen and the offline real-life friends would not be made or resisted anymore. People might think they are happy and satisfying their life, however, only online. Therefore, they would end up people feel lonely and isolated from the world when they are in real life. Lastly, [[Self-esteem|low self-esteem]] and [[anxiety]] are a lack of confidence and feeling negative about oneself. People check the reaction to their posts and care about likes, comments, and other\u2019s post, which decreases self-esteem.

For example, if the person is diagnosed with depression, they start to compare themselves with others. They might think everyone expects him or herself is happy and lucky. Then, the person will start to curse all the people and hate him or herself. Furthermore, the person will remind their selves that they might fail in everything they try because they cannot succeed.\n\nTheir suicide rate rose by 65% in those five years and the number of girls with severe depression rose by 58%.

Furthermore, Phone addiction not only makes the people who are addicted to phone isolated but also makes the people around them feel isolated.\n\n== Low self-esteem and anxiety ==\nThe other psychological symptoms that are caused by phone addiction are self-esteem and anxiety. [[Social networking service|Social Network Service]] (SNS) is one of the main streams in the world these days, therefore it dissolved a lot in daily life too. Studies have consistently shown that there are significant relationships between high extraversion, high anxiety, and teenagers\u2019 low self-esteem with mobile phone, and the stronger the young person\u2019s mobile phone addiction, the more likely is that individual to have high mobile phone call time, and excessive number of calls and text messages.<ref name=\"Hong 2152\u20132159\"/> When we communicate with friends, we use SNS or message to contact.\n\nAnxious people more easily perceive certain normal life matters as pressure. To reduce this stress might result in even more addictive behaviors and females are more likely to use mobile phones to maintain social relations.<ref name=\"Hong 2152\u20132159\"/> When we see cool things or want to show something to others, we open our Snapchat, Instagram, or Twitter to post it. After, people check the reaction to their posts and care about likes, comments, and other\u2019s post, which decreases self-esteem. Furthermore, even we are with friends, we check our SNS updates instead of having a conversation. We reply to another friend\u2019s message even we are with other friend and check our phone even the notifications were not on. These connect to [[anxiety]]; caring other\u2019s reaction to show off themselves, checking phone frequently with no reason. In other words, it is called, \u201cForecast error\u201d that keeps us coming back, even though it often has a negative effect on our mental health. And this cycle sounds eerily like a classic addiction.\n\nMoreover, online, under the name anonymous, people utilize it in bad ways like the cyberbully or spread rumors. People also force their opinions and post bad comments that might hurt others too. All of these examples would result in people by having a symptom of anxiety and low self-esteem that connects to depression.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Telecommunication}}\n*[[Computer addiction]]\n*[[De Quervain syndrome]]\n*[[Digital detox]], a period of time during which a person refrains from using electronic connecting devices\n*[[Digital media use and mental health]]\n*[[Internet addiction disorder]]\n*{{Section link|Mobile phone|Health effects}}\n*[[Mobile phone radiation and health]]\n*[[Mobile phones and driving safety]]\n*[[Nomophobia]], a proposed name for the fear of being out of cellular phone contact\n*[[Smartphone zombie]]\n*[[Television addiction]]\n* [[Underearners Anonymous]]\n*[[Video game overuse]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |title=TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING: Are You Addicted to Your Smartphone? |publisher=Sentia Publishing |last=Roberts |first=James A. |year=2015 |isbn=978-0996300476}}\n* {{cite news|last=Richtel|first=Matt|title=It Don't Mean a Thing if You Ain't Got That Ping|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/weekinreview/22richtel.html|accessdate=3 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 April 2007}} {{open access}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Takao |first1=Motoharu |last2=Takahashi |first2=Susumu |last3=Kitamura |first3=Masayoshi |title=Addictive Personality and Problematic Mobile Phone Use |journal=CyberPsychology & Behavior |date=October 2009 |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=501\u2013507 |doi=10.1089/cpb.2009.0022 |pmid=19817562 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fea84a81afb30758b29218dd44e54762fa881cd4 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=S\u00e1nchez-Mart\u00ednez |first1=Mercedes |last2=Otero |first2=Angel |title=Factors Associated with Cell Phone Use in Adolescents in the Community of Madrid (Spain) |journal=CyberPsychology & Behavior |date=April 2009 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=131\u2013137 |doi=10.1089/cpb.2008.0164 |pmid=19072078 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3ac1971162d061f2e6da497d407cf65c80185c2c }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Griffiths |first1=Mark |title=Does Internet and Computer 'Addiction' Exist?
