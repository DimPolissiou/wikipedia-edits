Most of the storms formed either in the [[Mozambique Channel]] or in the far eastern portion of the basin, with five storms crossing from the adjacent [[1998\u201399 Australian region cyclone season|Australian basin]] east of 90\u00b0&nbsp;[[Longitude|E]]. As a result, few storms impacted [[Madagascar]], and none made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the [[Africa]]n continent. Throughout most of the season, there was below-normal [[sea surface temperature]]s in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar. In February, typically the peak in activity, [[R\u00e9union]] island recorded its highest average monthly pressure since 1953. Due to generally unfavorable conditions, there were only six tropical storms tracked by the [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] office (MFR) on R\u00e9union. There were only two tropical cyclones &ndash; a storm with winds of at least 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph).\n\nActivity began late, with the first tropical storm &ndash; Alda &ndash; forming on January&nbsp;16, the third latest ever recorded at the time. Alda formed in the [[Mozambique Channel]], which was one of few favorable areas for [[tropical cyclogenesis]] in the season. It brought rainfall to southwestern Madagascar that alleviated previously dry conditions. The next five tropical storms either originated or crossed into the adjacent Australian basin, where storms were monitored by the [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BoM). Both Tropical Storm Chikita and Tropical Cyclone Davina brought beneficial rainfall to the [[Mascarene Islands]]. The latter storm caused two drowning deaths on R\u00e9union and caused some crop damage. The strongest storm &ndash; Evrina &ndash; peaked as a strong cyclone in the Australian but weakened upon crossing 90\u00b0E, with 10-minute [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph) in the basin.

Although there were gale-force winds in the southwest periphery, the circulation was located on the northern edge of the convection. The depression neared tropical storm intensity, but an increase in wind shear from a nearby trough prevented further intensification. The JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 85&nbsp;km/h (50&nbsp;mph), making the system a tropical storm by their assessment.

A station on the island recorded sustained winds of {{convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} with gusts to {{convert|104|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} about three hours before and after the closest approach; the observations suggested that the depression could have become a tropical storm.

Most of the storms formed either in the [[Mozambique Channel]] or in the far eastern portion of the basin, with five storms crossing from the adjacent [[1998\u201399 Australian region cyclone season|Australian basin]] east of 90\u00b0&nbsp;[[Longitude|E]]. As a result, few storms impacted [[Madagascar]], and none made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] on the [[Africa]]n continent. Throughout most of the season, there was below-normal [[sea surface temperature]]s in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar. In February, typically the peak in activity, [[R\u00e9union]] island recorded its highest average monthly pressure since 1953. Due to generally unfavorable conditions, there were only six tropical storms tracked by the [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] office (MFR) on R\u00e9union. There were only two tropical cyclones &ndash; a storm with winds of at least 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph).\n\nActivity began late, with the first tropical storm &ndash; Alda &ndash; forming on January&nbsp;16, the third latest ever recorded at the time. Alda formed in the [[Mozambique Channel]], which was one of few favorable areas for [[tropical cyclogenesis]] in the season. It brought rainfall to southwestern Madagascar that alleviated previously dry conditions. The next five tropical storms either originated or crossed into the adjacent Australian basin, where storms were monitored by the [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BoM). Both Tropical Storm Chikita and Tropical Cyclone Davina brought beneficial rainfall to the [[Mascarene Islands]]. The latter storm caused two drowning deaths on R\u00e9union and caused some crop damage. The strongest storm &ndash; Evrina &ndash; peaked as a strong cyclone in the Australian but weakened upon crossing 90\u00b0E, with 10-minute [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph) in the basin. The final storm was unnamed, crossing from the Australian basin on April&nbsp;21 as a minimal tropical storm before quickly dissipating. There were also several tropical disturbances or depressions, many short-lived. The first of these formed on September&nbsp;3 in the northeastern portion of the basin, and there was a tropical depression in February in the Mozambique Channel that approached tropical storm status.\n\n==Season summary==\n<center>\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\n\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/07/1998 till:01/05/1999\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/07/1998\n\nColors     =\n id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n id:GP  value:red\n id:DT  value:rgb(0.5,0.8,1)  legend:Tropical_Disturbance_&lt;_50_km/h_(_&lt;_31_mph)\n id:TD  value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1)  legend:Tropical_Depression_=_51&ndash;62_km/h_(32&ndash;38_mph)\n id:MS  value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)  legend:Moderate_tropical_Storm_=_63&ndash;88_km/h_(39&ndash;54_mph)\n id:SS  value:rgb(0.80,1,1)     legend:Severe_Tropical_Storm_=_89&ndash;117_km/h_(55&ndash;73_mph)\n id:TC  value:rgb(1,1,0.80)     legend:Tropical_Cyclone_=_118&ndash;165_km/h_(74&ndash;102_mph)\n id:IT  value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)  legend:Intense_=_166&ndash;212_km/h_(103&ndash;132_mph)\n id:VI  value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)  legend:Very_Intense_&gt;_212_km/h_(_&gt;_132_mph)\n\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\n\nBarData =\n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\n\nPlotData=\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:20/07/1998 till:25/07/1998 color:TD text:\"4H\"\n  from:03/09/1998 till:06/09/1998 color:DT text:\"A1\"\n  from:29/09/1998 till:02/10/1998 color:DT text:\"A2\"\n  from:04/12/1998 till:04/12/1998 color:DT text:\"A3\"\n  from:03/01/1999 till:05/01/1999 color:DT text:\"A4\"\n  from:14/01/1999 till:19/01/1999 color:SS text:\"Alda\"\n  from:28/01/1999 till:02/02/1999 color:MS text:\"Damien-Birenda\"\n  barset:break\n  from:31/01/1999 till:04/02/1999 color:MS text:\"Chikita\"\n  from:11/02/1999 till:17/02/1999 color:TD text:\"D1\"\n  from:23/02/1999 till:06/03/1999 color:DT text:\"D2-E1\"\n  from:28/02/1999 till:20/03/1999 color:DT text:\"E2\"\n  from:02/03/1999 till:19/03/1999 color:IT text:\"Davina\"\n  from:11/03/1999 till:21/03/1999 color:TD text:\"E3\"\n  from:01/04/1999 till:10/04/1999 color:IT text:\"Frederic\u2013Evrina\"\n  barset:break\n  from:21/04/1999 till:24/04/1999 color:MS text:\"Hamish-F1\"\n bar:Month width:6 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/07/1998 till:01/08/1998 text:July\n  from:01/08/1998 till:01/09/1998 text:August\n  from:01/09/1998 till:01/10/1998 text:September\n  from:01/10/1998 till:01/11/1998 text:October\n  from:01/11/1998 till:01/12/1998 text:November\n  from:01/12/1998 till:01/01/1999 text:December\n  from:01/01/1999 till:01/02/1999 text:January\n  from:01/02/1999 till:01/03/1999 text:February\n  from:01/03/1999 till:01/04/1999 text:March\n  from:01/04/1999 till:01/05/1999 text:April\n\n</timeline>\n</center>\nThe [[M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France]] office (MFR) on [[R\u00e9union]] island issued warnings in tropical cyclones within the basin during the season.

In general, [[sea surface temperature]]s were below normal, and [[atmospheric pressure]]s were above normal, both unfavorable for [[tropical cyclogenesis]]. In the month of February, on average the peak time for activity, there was a general lack of [[convection (meteorology)|convection]], or thunderstorms, east of Madagascar. The average monthly pressure on R\u00e9union was the highest since reliable records began in 1953. The low number of storms occurred despite an otherwise active cyclone year in the southern hemisphere. In its summary of the season, the MFR described the lack of activity as \"rare and remarkable\", possibly related to a [[Walker circulation]]. The agency monitored 14&nbsp;tropical disturbances, of which only eight were tropical depressions for at least 24&nbsp;hours.

It was released on 8 March 2010 in the United Kingdom, and then on 12 April 2010 for the rest of the world. ''Tear the Signs Down'' was the first album released by the band on their own Armoured Records after splitting with B-Unique. The first single \"[[Interstate (song)|Interstate]]\" was released on 6 December 2009, with second single \"[[Run & Hide (The Automatic song)|Run & Hide]]\" released a week prior to the album itself on 1 March 2010.<ref>[http://frost.theautomatic.co.uk/stuff/mixing-drinks/ mixing, drinks] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816191956/http://frost.theautomatic.co.uk/stuff/mixing-drinks/ |date=16 August 2011 }} theautomatic.co.uk, James Frost, 30 October 2009</ref> Third single \"[[Cannot Be Saved]]\" was released on 20 June 2010.<ref>[http://www.rocksound.tv/videos/article/the-automatic-cannot-be-saved The Automatic - Cannot Be Saved] [[Rock Sound]], 2 June 2010</ref><ref>[http://theautomatic.co.uk/uncategorized/sunset-festival-saturday-29th-may-new-single-cannot-be-saved-out-20th-june/ Sunset Festival Saturday 29th&nbsp;May, New Single Cannot Be Saved Out 20th&nbsp;June] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007022737/http://theautomatic.co.uk/uncategorized/sunset-festival-saturday-29th-may-new-single-cannot-be-saved-out-20th-june/ |date=7 October 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Recording and production==\nAfter record labels B-Unique and Polydor failed to release previous album ''[[This Is a Fix]]'' on time, or to promote it due to the two labels reportedly falling out, the band made the decision to end their five-album deal. After offers from various record labels the band ultimately decided to set up their own record label Armoured Records giving the band complete creative control, yet the ability to reach a mass audience with [[EMI]] contracted to distribute the album.<ref>[http://newsblog.thecmuwebsite.com/post/EMI-to-distribute-The-Automatic.aspx EMI contracted to distribute The Automatic] /newsblog.thecmuwebsite.com, 10 November 2009</ref> After touring in November 2008 the band returned to the studio, only four months after the release of ''This Is a Fix''.<ref>[http://theautomatic.co.uk/uncategorized/19-9-9-cardiff-barfly/ 19.09.09 Cardiff Barfly] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007021559/http://theautomatic.co.uk/uncategorized/19-9-9-cardiff-barfly/ |date=7 October 2011 }} theautomatic.co.uk, 18 September 2009</ref>\n\nThroughout the rest of 2008 and up until November 2009 the band worked from their [[Cardiff]] recording studio on new material, working on around some 20 ideas, which were eventually reduced to 11 album tracks and an unknown number of B-sides.<ref name=\"The Automatic Man\">[http://www.skysports.com/socceram/story/0,21644,13871_5785516,00.html The Automatic Man] [[Sky Sports]], 19 December 2009</ref> After the writing and demoing stage, the band worked with Richard Jackson, the producer of a number of tracks on their previous albums ''[[Not Accepted Anywhere]]'' and ''This Is a Fix'', describing Jackson as 'almost being the fifth member of the Automatic'.<ref name=interview>[http://panicdots.com/2010/03/the-automatic-interview/ The Automatic Interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312061653/http://panicdots.com/2010/03/the-automatic-interview/ |date=12 March 2010 }} panicdots.com, 6 March 2010</ref> The album was eventually recorded with Jackson and Stephen Davies at Warwick Hall Studios in Cardiff, and later mixed at Buffalo Studios and Machine Rooms in Cardiff. In the studio the band worked with Nathan Stone and Carly Worsfold, who provided string sections on the tracks \"Run & Hide\" and \"High Time\".<ref>Tear the Signs Down, ARMRD03CD, 2010, album sleeve</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Lyrical themes===\nIn an interview with ''[[Bedfordshire on Sunday]]'' vocalist & bassist [[Robin Hawkins|Rob Hawkins]] summarised the lyrical construction of all three albums by the Automatic; with ''Not Accepted Anywhere'' being about personal experiences and growing up, ''This Is a Fix'' was largely based around news and world events, whilst ''Tear the Signs Down'' is more about story telling.<ref>[http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/Lifestyle-and-leisure/There-is-so-much-more-to-this-band-than-just-a-Monster-hit.htm There is so much more to this band than just a Monster hit] bedfordshire-news.co.uk, March 2010</ref> Lyrically ''Tear the Signs Down'' is far more focused, as opposed to ''This Is a Fix'', according to Paul Mullen. The lyrics themselves are mostly written by Hawkins and Mullen, however Iwan Griffiths and James Frost also had an input if a lyric didn't sit right with all four bandmates.<ref name=interview/>\n\nHawkins and Mullen went through ''Tear the Signs Down'' track by track for American website randomville.com, describing the lyrical content of each song on 2 March 2010. Lead track \"Insides\" is described by Paul Mullen as; \"the end of a relationship and the inability to cope with that fact. The build up of anger and tension so that you are ready and primed to break and destroy\", and is also noted as being very different to anything the band have previously produced. The lyrics in first single \"[[Interstate (song)|Interstate]]\" reflect American culture - taken from the band's experience of recording half of previous record ''This Is a Fix'' in [[West Hollywood, California]] with [[Butch Walker]], the song comments on the Americans' attitude described by Mullen as a \"sickly infectious 'sweet dude' attitude they have is a great attribute, anything goes, anything can happen\", he also noted the verse section of \"Interstate\"; \"every band is allowed a song where they go 'na na na' and 'oh yeah' this is ours\" and that they won't be doing it again. \"Cannot Be Saved\" was penned by Hawkins and is about [[paranoia]], described by Rob as \"You know, like in the summer when everyone seems to be on edge and it feels like it could just kick off for no reason\".\n\nThe lyrics of \"List\" tell of how things need to go wrong sometimes in order to ultimately succeed, \"It\u2019s about experiencing a lack of your own importance in the world; about people lying to you to supposedly protect you but protect you from what? It's about having your eyes opened you could say\", \"List\" then leads instrumentally into second single \"[[Run & Hide (The Automatic song)|Run & Hide]]\" which Mullen describes as \"a feeling, a moment of being to [[Self-consciousness|self conscious]] to let yourself go. It's about the way life can be all about seizing moments without having any guarantees, pushing through all that self-doubt and seeing what happens\", similarly \"High Time\" penned by Mullen is about his lack of [[motivation]]; \"it's about giving it a go. Whatever it is. Not putting it off, just fucking do it\", and \"Tear It Down\" - the last song written and recorded for ''Tear the Signs Down'' is about \"pulling yourself out of a bad situation, and shaping things how you want them. In that respect that's what the last year has been for us. A process of facing up to realities, dealing with them and taking charge\".<ref name=interview/><ref>[http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/Lifestyle-and-leisure/There-is-so-much-more-to-this-band-than-just-a-Monster-hit.htm bedfordshire-news.co.uk, March 2010]</ref>\n\n\"Sweat Heat Noise\", sung by Hawkins, is about the band's live hiatus after touring ''This Is a Fix'' in 2008; \"it's an optimistic song, it's also about the frustration of waiting for that chance to prove yourself again\". The lyrics of \"Race to the Heart of the Sun\" came from Hawkins; \"I had a revelation when I was falling asleep one night, that all human progress is a series of collisions - from [[cavemen]] using [[Club (weapon)|clubs]] as tools, to sex, to war to [[particle accelerators]], to [[cooking]] everything. That's what this song is about\". Mullen noted that the lyrics for \"Can I Take You Home\" came from an experience at the [[Egyptian pyramid]]s, where he saw a German woman who he shared eye contact with for a moment. \"Something Else\" is musically and lyrically a nod towards the band's influences.<ref>[http://randomville.com/wordpress/?p=6465 EXCLUSIVE: THE AUTOMATIC GIVES US A TRACK-BY-TRACK OF THEIR NEW ALBUM TEAR THE SIGNS DOWN] Randomville.com, 2 March 2010</ref>\n\n===Style===\n''Tear the Signs Down'' is closer to the style of the band's debut album ''Not Accepted Anywhere'', with the use of more synthesizer parts and three-part-vocals from Hawkins, Frost and Mullen. The album uses the band's trademark pop hooks, with big choruses, whilst maintaining the band's rock edge, it is also the band's most diverse record yet, being compared to [[Soulwax]] and [[the Knife]].<ref name=Adam>{{cite news |title= The Automatic Tear The Signs Down interview|author=[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/mobile/displaya.asp?xfile=/data/citytimes/2009/November/citytimes_November80.xml&section=citytimes Adam Zacharias]|work=[[Khaleej Times]] |date= 5 November 2009}}</ref> First single \"Interstate\" bridges between ''This Is a Fix'' and ''Tear the Signs Down'', with the lyrics referring to recording the previous album abroad in the US, the record as a whole has also been described as their most diverse yet.<ref name=\"walesonline.co.uk\">[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/music-in-wales/2009/11/11/return-of-the-monster-the-automatic-are-back-91466-25138030/ Return of the monster; The Automatic are back] Wales Online, 11 November 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.euronews.net/2009/12/10/the-automatic-break-free-for-album-no3/ the automatic break free for album no3] euronews.net, 10 December 2009</ref> Single \"Run & Hide\" along with \"High Time\" and two interludes feature additional string instrumentalists.<ref>[[The Automatic]] Tear the Signs Down, \"List\", \"Run & Hide\", \"High Time\" 3 March 2010</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe first track from ''Tear the Signs Down'', \"Something Else\", was previewed on YouTube and the band's official website on 6 August 2009<ref>[http://theautomatic.co.uk/uncategorized/best-laid-plans/ Best Laid Plans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007021538/http://theautomatic.co.uk/uncategorized/best-laid-plans/ |date=7 October 2011 }} theautomatic.co.uk, youtube something else, 6 August 2009</ref> Months later the album's release date was set for 15 February 2010 with the announcement of first single \"[[Interstate (song)|Interstate]]\" on 3 November 2009, along with the album's title ''Tear the Signs Down'', as well as the first radio play of \"Interstate\" and the free download of album bonus track \"Something Else\".<ref>[http://theautomatic.co.uk/uncategorized/new-single-interstate-and-album-announced/ New single \"Interstate and album announced\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007021809/http://theautomatic.co.uk/uncategorized/new-single-interstate-and-album-announced/ |date=7 October 2011 }} theautomatic.co.uk, 3 November 2009</ref> On ''[[Soccer AM]]'' the band changed the album's release to 8 March 2010.

With the release of their second album ''This Is a Fix'', the departure of Alex Pennie and arrival of Paul Mullen the band's sound had changed, which was something that B-Unique were not entirely happy with, as well as this record labels B-Unique and Polydor supposedly fell out leading towards ''This Is a Fix'' receiving barely any promotion.<ref name=\"walesonline.co.uk\"/>\n\n<blockquote class=\"toccolours\" style=\"text-align:right; width:30%; float:right; padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; display:table;\">You put a year of your life into making a record, then the label doesn't tell anyone it's released or distribute it.

After splitting with Polydor and B-Unique, the band had several offers from other record labels \u2013 however, they declined with the vision of setting up their own record label, to have complete creative control over the music that they would release on their next record.

It was released on 8 March 2010 in the United Kingdom, and then on 12 April 2010 for the rest of the world. ''Tear the Signs Down'' was the first album released by the band on their own Armoured Records after splitting with B-Unique. The first single \"[[Interstate (song)|Interstate]]\" was released on 6 December 2009, with second single \"[[Run & Hide (The Automatic song)|Run & Hide]]\" released a week prior to the album itself on 1 March 2010.<ref>[http://frost.theautomatic.co.uk/stuff/mixing-drinks/ mixing, drinks] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816191956/http://frost.theautomatic.co.uk/stuff/mixing-drinks/ |date=16 August 2011 }} theautomatic.co.uk, James Frost, 30 October 2009</ref> Third single \"[[Cannot Be Saved]]\" was released on 20 June 2010.<ref>[http://www.rocksound.tv/videos/article/the-automatic-cannot-be-saved The Automatic - Cannot Be Saved] [[Rock Sound]], 2 June 2010</ref><ref>[http://theautomatic.co.uk/uncategorized/sunset-festival-saturday-29th-may-new-single-cannot-be-saved-out-20th-june/ Sunset Festival Saturday 29th&nbsp;May, New Single Cannot Be Saved Out 20th&nbsp;June] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007022737/http://theautomatic.co.uk/uncategorized/sunset-festival-saturday-29th-may-new-single-cannot-be-saved-out-20th-june/ |date=7 October 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Recording and production==\nAfter record labels B-Unique and Polydor failed to release previous album ''[[This Is a Fix]]'' on time, or to promote it due to the two labels reportedly falling out, the band made the decision to end their five-album deal. After offers from various record labels the band ultimately decided to set up their own record label Armoured Records giving the band complete creative control, yet the ability to reach a mass audience with [[EMI]] contracted to distribute the album.<ref>[http://newsblog.thecmuwebsite.com/post/EMI-to-distribute-The-Automatic.aspx EMI contracted to distribute The Automatic] /newsblog.thecmuwebsite.com, 10 November 2009</ref> After touring in November 2008 the band returned to the studio, only four months after the release of ''This Is a Fix''.<ref>[http://theautomatic.co.uk/uncategorized/19-9-9-cardiff-barfly/ 19.09.09 Cardiff Barfly] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007021559/http://theautomatic.co.uk/uncategorized/19-9-9-cardiff-barfly/ |date=7 October 2011 }} theautomatic.co.uk, 18 September 2009</ref>\n\nThroughout the rest of 2008 and up until November 2009 the band worked from their [[Cardiff]] recording studio on new material, working on around some 20 ideas, which were eventually reduced to 11 album tracks and an unknown number of B-sides.<ref name=\"The Automatic Man\">[http://www.skysports.com/socceram/story/0,21644,13871_5785516,00.html The Automatic Man] [[Sky Sports]], 19 December 2009</ref> After the writing and demoing stage, the band worked with Richard Jackson, the producer of a number of tracks on their previous albums ''[[Not Accepted Anywhere]]'' and ''This Is a Fix'', describing Jackson as 'almost being the fifth member of the Automatic'.<ref name=interview>[http://panicdots.com/2010/03/the-automatic-interview/ The Automatic Interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312061653/http://panicdots.com/2010/03/the-automatic-interview/ |date=12 March 2010 }} panicdots.com, 6 March 2010</ref> The album was eventually recorded with Jackson and Stephen Davies at Warwick Hall Studios in Cardiff, and later mixed at Buffalo Studios and Machine Rooms in Cardiff. In the studio the band worked with Nathan Stone and Carly Worsfold, who provided string sections on the tracks \"Run & Hide\" and \"High Time\".<ref>Tear the Signs Down, ARMRD03CD, 2010, album sleeve</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Lyrical themes===\nIn an interview with ''[[Bedfordshire on Sunday]]'' vocalist & bassist [[Robin Hawkins|Rob Hawkins]] summarised the lyrical construction of all three albums by the Automatic; with ''Not Accepted Anywhere'' being about personal experiences and growing up, ''This Is a Fix'' was largely based around news and world events, whilst ''Tear the Signs Down'' is more about story telling.<ref>[http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/Lifestyle-and-leisure/There-is-so-much-more-to-this-band-than-just-a-Monster-hit.htm There is so much more to this band than just a Monster hit] bedfordshire-news.co.uk, March 2010</ref> Lyrically ''Tear the Signs Down'' is far more focused, as opposed to ''This Is a Fix'', according to Paul Mullen. The lyrics themselves are mostly written by Hawkins and Mullen, however Iwan Griffiths and James Frost also had an input if a lyric didn't sit right with all four bandmates.<ref name=interview/>\n\nHawkins and Mullen went through ''Tear the Signs Down'' track by track for American website randomville.com, describing the lyrical content of each song on 2 March 2010. Lead track \"Insides\" is described by Paul Mullen as; \"the end of a relationship and the inability to cope with that fact. The build up of anger and tension so that you are ready and primed to break and destroy\", and is also noted as being very different to anything the band have previously produced. The lyrics in first single \"[[Interstate (song)|Interstate]]\" reflect American culture - taken from the band's experience of recording half of previous record ''This Is a Fix'' in [[West Hollywood, California]] with [[Butch Walker]], the song comments on the Americans' attitude described by Mullen as a \"sickly infectious 'sweet dude' attitude they have is a great attribute, anything goes, anything can happen\", he also noted the verse section of \"Interstate\"; \"every band is allowed a song where they go 'na na na' and 'oh yeah' this is ours\" and that they won't be doing it again. \"Cannot Be Saved\" was penned by Hawkins and is about [[paranoia]], described by Rob as \"You know, like in the summer when everyone seems to be on edge and it feels like it could just kick off for no reason\".\n\nThe lyrics of \"List\" tell of how things need to go wrong sometimes in order to ultimately succeed, \"It\u2019s about experiencing a lack of your own importance in the world; about people lying to you to supposedly protect you but protect you from what? It's about having your eyes opened you could say\", \"List\" then leads instrumentally into second single \"[[Run & Hide (The Automatic song)|Run & Hide]]\" which Mullen describes as \"a feeling, a moment of being to [[Self-consciousness|self conscious]] to let yourself go. It's about the way life can be all about seizing moments without having any guarantees, pushing through all that self-doubt and seeing what happens\", similarly \"High Time\" penned by Mullen is about his lack of [[motivation]]; \"it's about giving it a go. Whatever it is. Not putting it off, just fucking do it\", and \"Tear It Down\" - the last song written and recorded for ''Tear the Signs Down'' is about \"pulling yourself out of a bad situation, and shaping things how you want them. In that respect that's what the last year has been for us. A process of facing up to realities, dealing with them and taking charge\".<ref name=interview/><ref>[http://www.bedfordshire-news.co.uk/Lifestyle-and-leisure/There-is-so-much-more-to-this-band-than-just-a-Monster-hit.htm bedfordshire-news.co.uk, March 2010]</ref>\n\n\"Sweat Heat Noise\", sung by Hawkins, is about the band's live hiatus after touring ''This Is a Fix'' in 2008; \"it's an optimistic song, it's also about the frustration of waiting for that chance to prove yourself again\". The lyrics of \"Race to the Heart of the Sun\" came from Hawkins; \"I had a revelation when I was falling asleep one night, that all human progress is a series of collisions - from [[cavemen]] using [[Club (weapon)|clubs]] as tools, to sex, to war to [[particle accelerators]], to [[cooking]] everything. That's what this song is about\". Mullen noted that the lyrics for \"Can I Take You Home\" came from an experience at the [[Egyptian pyramid]]s, where he saw a German woman who he shared eye contact with for a moment. \"Something Else\" is musically and lyrically a nod towards the band's influences.<ref>[http://randomville.com/wordpress/?p=6465 EXCLUSIVE: THE AUTOMATIC GIVES US A TRACK-BY-TRACK OF THEIR NEW ALBUM TEAR THE SIGNS DOWN] Randomville.com, 2 March 2010</ref>\n\n===Style===\n''Tear the Signs Down'' is closer to the style of the band's debut album ''Not Accepted Anywhere'', with the use of more synthesizer parts and three-part-vocals from Hawkins, Frost and Mullen. The album uses the band's trademark pop hooks, with big choruses, whilst maintaining the band's rock edge, it is also the band's most diverse record yet, being compared to [[Soulwax]] and [[the Knife]].<ref name=Adam>{{cite news |title= The Automatic Tear The Signs Down interview|author=[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/mobile/displaya.asp?xfile=/data/citytimes/2009/November/citytimes_November80.xml&section=citytimes Adam Zacharias]|work=[[Khaleej Times]] |date= 5 November 2009}}</ref> First single \"Interstate\" bridges between ''This Is a Fix'' and ''Tear the Signs Down'', with the lyrics referring to recording the previous album abroad in the US, the record as a whole has also been described as their most diverse yet.<ref name=\"walesonline.co.uk\">[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/music-in-wales/2009/11/11/return-of-the-monster-the-automatic-are-back-91466-25138030/ Return of the monster; The Automatic are back] Wales Online, 11 November 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.euronews.net/2009/12/10/the-automatic-break-free-for-album-no3/ the automatic break free for album no3] euronews.net, 10 December 2009</ref> Single \"Run & Hide\" along with \"High Time\" and two interludes feature additional string instrumentalists.<ref>[[The Automatic]] Tear the Signs Down, \"List\", \"Run & Hide\", \"High Time\" 3 March 2010</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe first track from ''Tear the Signs Down'', \"Something Else\", was previewed on YouTube and the band's official website on 6 August 2009<ref>[http://theautomatic.co.uk/uncategorized/best-laid-plans/ Best Laid Plans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007021538/http://theautomatic.co.uk/uncategorized/best-laid-plans/ |date=7 October 2011 }} theautomatic.co.uk, youtube something else, 6 August 2009</ref> Months later the album's release date was set for 15 February 2010 with the announcement of first single \"[[Interstate (song)|Interstate]]\" on 3 November 2009, along with the album's title ''Tear the Signs Down'', as well as the first radio play of \"Interstate\" and the free download of album bonus track \"Something Else\".<ref>[http://theautomatic.co.uk/uncategorized/new-single-interstate-and-album-announced/ New single \"Interstate and album announced\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007021809/http://theautomatic.co.uk/uncategorized/new-single-interstate-and-album-announced/ |date=7 October 2011 }} theautomatic.co.uk, 3 November 2009</ref> On ''[[Soccer AM]]'' the band changed the album's release to 8 March 2010.

{"title_page": "List of statements independent of ZFC", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThe [[mathematics|mathematical]] statements discussed below are {{not a typo|provably}} [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of [[ZFC]] (the canonical [[axiomatic set theory]] of contemporary mathematics, consisting of the [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms]] plus the [[axiom of choice]]), assuming that ZFC is [[consistent]]. A statement is independent of ZFC (sometimes phrased \"undecidable in ZFC\") if it can neither be proven nor disproven from the axioms of ZFC.\n\n==[[Axiomatic set theory]]==\nIn 1931, [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] proved the first ZFC independence result, namely that the consistency of ZFC itself was independent of ZFC ([[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem|G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem]]).\n\nThe following statements are independent of ZFC, among others:\n\n* the consistency of ZFC;\n* the [[continuum hypothesis]] or CH (G\u00f6del produced a model of ZFC in which CH is true, showing that CH cannot be disproven in ZFC; [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] later invented the method of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] to exhibit a model of ZFC in which CH fails, showing that CH cannot be proven in ZFC. The following four independence results are also due to G\u00f6del/Cohen.);\n* the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] (GCH); \n* a related independent statement is that if a set ''x'' has fewer elements than ''y'', then ''x'' also has fewer [[subset]]s than ''y''. In particular, this statement fails when the cardinalities of the power sets of ''x'' and ''y'' coincide;\n* the [[axiom of constructibility]] (''V'' = ''L''); \n* the [[diamond principle]] (\u25ca);\n* [[Martin's axiom]] (MA);\n* MA + \u00acCH (independence shown by [[Robert Solovay|Solovay]] and [[Stanley Tennenbaum|Tennenbaum]])<ref>{{cite book| last=Kunen |first=Kenneth |authorlink= Kenneth Kunen|title=[[Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs]]|publisher=Elsevier|year=1980|isbn=0-444-86839-9}}</ref>.\n\n[[File:Implication Chains of Undecidable ZFC Statements.png|thumbnail|Diagram showing the implication chains]]\n\nWe have the following chains of implications:\n:''V'' = ''L'' \u2192 \u25ca \u2192 CH,\n:''V'' = ''L'' \u2192 GCH \u2192 CH,\n:CH \u2192 MA,\nand (see section on order theory):\n:\u25ca \u2192 \u00ac[[Suslin hypothesis|SH]],\n:MA + \u00acCH \u2192 [[Aronszajn tree|EATS]] \u2192 SH.\n\nSeveral statements related to the existence of [[large cardinal]]s cannot be proven in ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent). These are independent of ZFC provided that they are consistent with ZFC, which most working set theorists believe to be the case. These statements are strong enough to imply the consistency of ZFC. This has the consequence (via [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem|G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem]]) that their consistency with ZFC cannot be proven in ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent). The following statements belong to this class:\n* Existence of [[inaccessible cardinal]]s\n* Existence of [[Mahlo cardinal]]s\n* Existence of [[measurable cardinal]]s (first conjectured by [[Stanislaw Ulam|Ulam]])\n* Existence of [[supercompact cardinal]]s\n\nThe following statements can be proven to be independent of ZFC assuming the consistency of a suitable large cardinal:\n* [[Proper forcing axiom]]\n* [[Open coloring axiom]]\n* [[Martin's maximum]]\n* Existence of [[zero sharp|0<sup>#</sup>]]\n* [[Singular cardinals hypothesis]]\n* [[Projective determinacy]] (and even the full [[axiom of determinacy]] if the [[axiom of choice]] is not assumed)\n\n==[[Set theory of the real line]]==\nThere are many [[cardinal invariant]]s of the real line, connected with [[measure theory]] and statements related to the [[Baire category theorem]], whose exact values are independent of ZFC. While nontrivial relations can be proved between them, most cardinal invariants can be any [[regular cardinal]] between [[Aleph number#Aleph-one|\u2135<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Cardinality of the continuum|2<sup>\u2135<sub>0</sub></sup>]]. This is a major area of study in the set theory of the real line (see [[Cichon diagram]]). MA has a tendency to set most interesting cardinal invariants equal to 2<sup>\u2135<sub>0</sub></sup>.\n\nA subset ''X'' of the real line is a [[strong measure zero set]] if to every sequence (''\u03b5<sub>n</sub>'') of positive reals there exists a sequence of intervals (''I<sub>n</sub>'') which covers ''X'' and such that ''I<sub>n</sub>'' has length at most ''\u03b5<sub>n</sub>''. Borel's conjecture, that every strong measure zero set is countable, is independent of ZFC.\n\nA subset ''X'' of the real line is <math>\\aleph_1</math>-dense if every open interval contains <math>\\aleph_1</math>-many elements of ''X''. Whether all <math>\\aleph_1</math>-dense sets are order-isomorphic is independent of ZFC.<ref>Baumgartner, J., All <math>\\aleph_1</math>-dense sets of reals can be isomorphic, Fund.

A statement is independent of ZFC (sometimes phrased \"undecidable in ZFC\") if it can neither be proven nor disproven from the axioms of ZFC.\n\n==[[Axiomatic set theory]]==\nIn 1931, [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] proved the first ZFC independence result, namely that the consistency of ZFC itself was independent of ZFC ([[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem|G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem]]).\n\nThe following statements are independent of ZFC, among others:\n\n* the consistency of ZFC;\n* the [[continuum hypothesis]] or CH (G\u00f6del produced a model of ZFC in which CH is true, showing that CH cannot be disproven in ZFC; [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] later invented the method of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] to exhibit a model of ZFC in which CH fails, showing that CH cannot be proven in ZFC. The following four independence results are also due to G\u00f6del/Cohen.);\n* the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] (GCH); \n* a related independent statement is that if a set ''x'' has fewer elements than ''y'', then ''x'' also has fewer [[subset]]s than ''y''. In particular, this statement fails when the cardinalities of the power sets of ''x'' and ''y'' coincide;\n* the [[axiom of constructibility]] (''V'' = ''L''); \n* the [[diamond principle]] (\u25ca);\n* [[Martin's axiom]] (MA);\n* MA + \u00acCH (independence shown by [[Robert Solovay|Solovay]] and [[Stanley Tennenbaum|Tennenbaum]])<ref>{{cite book| last=Kunen |first=Kenneth |authorlink= Kenneth Kunen|title=[[Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs]]|publisher=Elsevier|year=1980|isbn=0-444-86839-9}}</ref>.\n\n[[File:Implication Chains of Undecidable ZFC Statements.png|thumbnail|Diagram showing the implication chains]]\n\nWe have the following chains of implications:\n:''V'' = ''L'' \u2192 \u25ca \u2192 CH,\n:''V'' = ''L'' \u2192 GCH \u2192 CH,\n:CH \u2192 MA,\nand (see section on order theory):\n:\u25ca \u2192 \u00ac[[Suslin hypothesis|SH]],\n:MA + \u00acCH \u2192 [[Aronszajn tree|EATS]] \u2192 SH.\n\nSeveral statements related to the existence of [[large cardinal]]s cannot be proven in ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent). These are independent of ZFC provided that they are consistent with ZFC, which most working set theorists believe to be the case. These statements are strong enough to imply the consistency of ZFC. This has the consequence (via [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem|G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem]]) that their consistency with ZFC cannot be proven in ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent). The following statements belong to this class:\n* Existence of [[inaccessible cardinal]]s\n* Existence of [[Mahlo cardinal]]s\n* Existence of [[measurable cardinal]]s (first conjectured by [[Stanislaw Ulam|Ulam]])\n* Existence of [[supercompact cardinal]]s\n\nThe following statements can be proven to be independent of ZFC assuming the consistency of a suitable large cardinal:\n* [[Proper forcing axiom]]\n* [[Open coloring axiom]]\n* [[Martin's maximum]]\n* Existence of [[zero sharp|0<sup>#</sup>]]\n* [[Singular cardinals hypothesis]]\n* [[Projective determinacy]] (and even the full [[axiom of determinacy]] if the [[axiom of choice]] is not assumed)\n\n==[[Set theory of the real line]]==\nThere are many [[cardinal invariant]]s of the real line, connected with [[measure theory]] and statements related to the [[Baire category theorem]], whose exact values are independent of ZFC. While nontrivial relations can be proved between them, most cardinal invariants can be any [[regular cardinal]] between [[Aleph number#Aleph-one|\u2135<sub>1</sub>]] and [[Cardinality of the continuum|2<sup>\u2135<sub>0</sub></sup>]]. This is a major area of study in the set theory of the real line (see [[Cichon diagram]]). MA has a tendency to set most interesting cardinal invariants equal to 2<sup>\u2135<sub>0</sub></sup>.\n\nA subset ''X'' of the real line is a [[strong measure zero set]] if to every sequence (''\u03b5<sub>n</sub>'') of positive reals there exists a sequence of intervals (''I<sub>n</sub>'') which covers ''X'' and such that ''I<sub>n</sub>'' has length at most ''\u03b5<sub>n</sub>''. Borel's conjecture, that every strong measure zero set is countable, is independent of ZFC.\n\nA subset ''X'' of the real line is <math>\\aleph_1</math>-dense if every open interval contains <math>\\aleph_1</math>-many elements of ''X''. Whether all <math>\\aleph_1</math>-dense sets are order-isomorphic is independent of ZFC.<ref>Baumgartner, J., All <math>\\aleph_1</math>-dense sets of reals can be isomorphic, Fund.
