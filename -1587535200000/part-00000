It is produced by [[Laika (company)|Laika]]. It stars the voices of [[Charlize Theron]], [[Art Parkinson]], [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[George Takei]], [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]], [[Brenda Vaccaro]], [[Rooney Mara]], and [[Matthew McConaughey]]. The film revolves around Kubo, a young boy who wields a magical [[shamisen]] (a Japanese [[stringed instrument]]) and whose left eye was stolen during infancy. Accompanied by an anthropomorphic [[snow monkey]] and [[beetle]], he must subdue his mother's corrupted Sisters and his power-hungry grandfather Raiden the Moon King, who is responsible for stealing his left eye.\n\n''Kubo'' premiered at [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] and was released by [[Focus Features]] in the United States on August 19 to critical acclaim, but was considered a box-office disappointment, grossing $77 million worldwide against a budget of $60 million. The film won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]], and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], becoming the second animated film ever to be nominated in the latter category following 1993's ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', and the first film to be nominated for both.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more detail to this summary. -->\n\nIn [[feudal Japan]], 12-year-old eyepatched Kubo tends to his ill mother Sariatu in a mountain cave near a village. He earns their living by magically manipulating [[origami]] with music from his [[shamisen]] for the village folk, telling the tale of his missing father Hanzo, a [[samurai]] warrior. Kubo is never able to finish his story, as he does not know what happened to Hanzo and Sariatu cannot recall the end due to her deteriorating mental state. Sariatu warns him not to stay out after dark as her Sisters, Karasu and Washi, and his grandfather, the Moon King (who took his eye when he was a baby) will find him and take his remaining eye.\n\nOne day, Kubo learns of the village's [[Bon Festival|Bon festival]] allowing them to speak to deceased loved ones. Kubo attends but is angry that Hanzo does not appear from his lantern, and forgets to return home before sunset. Karasu and Washi quickly find him and attack, but Sariatu suddenly appears and uses her magic to send Kubo far away, telling him to find his father's armor.\n\nKubo wakes up in a distant land to find Monkey, his wooden [[Japanese macaque|snow monkey]] charm, has come alive. Monkey tells him Sariatu is gone and the village destroyed. With help of \"Little Hanzo\", an origami figure based on Kubo's father, they set out to find the armor. Along the way, they meet Beetle, an [[amnesia]]c samurai who was cursed to take the form of a [[stag beetle]]/human hybrid but believes himself to have been Hanzo's apprentice.\n\nKubo, Monkey, and Beetle reclaim the \"Sword Unbreakable\" from a cave guarded by a [[Gashadokuro|giant skeleton]]. They cross the Long Lake in a leaf boat to locate the \"Breastplate Impenetrable\" deep underwater. Kubo and Beetle swim down to retrieve it and encounter a sea monster, the \"Garden of Eyes\", who first uses its many eyes to entrance its victims by showing them visions of secrets, then eats them. Kubo is caught in the creature's sight, but while entranced, comes to realize that Monkey is the reincarnated spirit of his mother. Beetle rescues the unconscious Kubo and obtains the Breastplate, but on returning to the boat, they find that Monkey has been badly wounded fighting and defeating Karasu.\n\nThey go to shore to recover, where Monkey explains that she and her Sisters were ordered by the Moon King to kill Hanzo, but she instead fell in love with him, and the Moon King branded her an enemy. That night, Kubo dreams of meeting Raiden, a blind elderly man, who points him towards the \"Helmet Invulnerable\" in Hanzo's abandoned fortress. They travel there the next day but realize too late it is a trap set by the Moon King and Washi. Washi reveals that Beetle is Hanzo, whom they cursed for taking Sariatu away from them, and kills Beetle. Monkey sacrifices herself, buying Kubo the time to use his shamisen to defeat Washi, breaking two of the three strings on it. Little Hanzo provides insight that the Helmet is actually the bell at the village, and Kubo breaks the last string to quickly travel there.\n\nAt the village, Kubo meets Raiden, who is revealed as the Moon King. He offers to take Kubo's other eye to make him immortal, but Kubo refuses. Raiden transforms into a giant ''[[Dunkleosteus]]''-like dragon, the Moon Beast, and pursues Kubo and the remaining villagers into its cemetery. When Hanzo's armor proves ineffective, Kubo removes it and restrings his shamisen using his mother's hair, his father's bowstring, and his own hair. With the instrument, he summons the spirits of the villagers' loved ones, who show the Moon Beast that memories are the strongest magic of all and can never be destroyed. Kubo and the spirits' magic protect themselves and the villagers from the Moon Beast, stripping him of his powers and leaving him a mortal human without any memories. Spurred on by Kubo's stories, the villagers take compassion and tell Raiden he was a man of many positive traits, accepting him into the village. Kubo is able to speak to his parents' ghosts during the subsequent Bon ceremony, as they watch the deceased villagers' lanterns transform into golden herons and fly to the spirit world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Art Parkinson]] as Kubo\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Monkey / Sariatu\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Beetle / Hanzo\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as Raiden the Moon King\n* [[Rooney Mara]] as Karasu and Washi the Sisters\n* [[George Takei]] as Hosato\n* [[Brenda Vaccaro]] as Kameyo\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as Hashi\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre.jpg|thumb|''[[Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre]]'' by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] inspired the giant skeleton.]]\nAnnounced in December 2014, the project is the directoral debut of Laika's CEO [[Travis Knight]].<ref name=\"Deadline1\">{{cite news|last1=Hammond|first1=Pete|title=Laika & Focus Begin Production On All-Star 'Kubo And The Two Strings' To Kick Off 3-Pic Deal|url=https://deadline.com/2014/12/laika-focus-three-picture-pact-kubo-and-the-two-strings-1201333450/|accessdate=January 15, 2015|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 22, 2014}}</ref> Laika's production designer [[Shannon Tindle]] pitched the story to Knight as a \"stop-motion samurai epic\".

Accompanied by an anthropomorphic [[snow monkey]] and [[beetle]], he must subdue his mother's corrupted Sisters and his power-hungry grandfather Raiden the Moon King, who is responsible for stealing his left eye.\n\n''Kubo'' premiered at [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] and was released by [[Focus Features]] in the United States on August 19 to critical acclaim, but was considered a box-office disappointment, grossing $77 million worldwide against a budget of $60 million. The film won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]], and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], becoming the second animated film ever to be nominated in the latter category following 1993's ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', and the first film to be nominated for both.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more detail to this summary. -->\n\nIn [[feudal Japan]], 12-year-old eyepatched Kubo tends to his ill mother Sariatu in a mountain cave near a village. He earns their living by magically manipulating [[origami]] with music from his [[shamisen]] for the village folk, telling the tale of his missing father Hanzo, a [[samurai]] warrior. Kubo is never able to finish his story, as he does not know what happened to Hanzo and Sariatu cannot recall the end due to her deteriorating mental state. Sariatu warns him not to stay out after dark as her Sisters, Karasu and Washi, and his grandfather, the Moon King (who took his eye when he was a baby) will find him and take his remaining eye.\n\nOne day, Kubo learns of the village's [[Bon Festival|Bon festival]] allowing them to speak to deceased loved ones. Kubo attends but is angry that Hanzo does not appear from his lantern, and forgets to return home before sunset. Karasu and Washi quickly find him and attack, but Sariatu suddenly appears and uses her magic to send Kubo far away, telling him to find his father's armor.\n\nKubo wakes up in a distant land to find Monkey, his wooden [[Japanese macaque|snow monkey]] charm, has come alive. Monkey tells him Sariatu is gone and the village destroyed. With help of \"Little Hanzo\", an origami figure based on Kubo's father, they set out to find the armor. Along the way, they meet Beetle, an [[amnesia]]c samurai who was cursed to take the form of a [[stag beetle]]/human hybrid but believes himself to have been Hanzo's apprentice.\n\nKubo, Monkey, and Beetle reclaim the \"Sword Unbreakable\" from a cave guarded by a [[Gashadokuro|giant skeleton]]. They cross the Long Lake in a leaf boat to locate the \"Breastplate Impenetrable\" deep underwater. Kubo and Beetle swim down to retrieve it and encounter a sea monster, the \"Garden of Eyes\", who first uses its many eyes to entrance its victims by showing them visions of secrets, then eats them. Kubo is caught in the creature's sight, but while entranced, comes to realize that Monkey is the reincarnated spirit of his mother. Beetle rescues the unconscious Kubo and obtains the Breastplate, but on returning to the boat, they find that Monkey has been badly wounded fighting and defeating Karasu.\n\nThey go to shore to recover, where Monkey explains that she and her Sisters were ordered by the Moon King to kill Hanzo, but she instead fell in love with him, and the Moon King branded her an enemy. That night, Kubo dreams of meeting Raiden, a blind elderly man, who points him towards the \"Helmet Invulnerable\" in Hanzo's abandoned fortress. They travel there the next day but realize too late it is a trap set by the Moon King and Washi. Washi reveals that Beetle is Hanzo, whom they cursed for taking Sariatu away from them, and kills Beetle. Monkey sacrifices herself, buying Kubo the time to use his shamisen to defeat Washi, breaking two of the three strings on it. Little Hanzo provides insight that the Helmet is actually the bell at the village, and Kubo breaks the last string to quickly travel there.\n\nAt the village, Kubo meets Raiden, who is revealed as the Moon King. He offers to take Kubo's other eye to make him immortal, but Kubo refuses. Raiden transforms into a giant ''[[Dunkleosteus]]''-like dragon, the Moon Beast, and pursues Kubo and the remaining villagers into its cemetery. When Hanzo's armor proves ineffective, Kubo removes it and restrings his shamisen using his mother's hair, his father's bowstring, and his own hair. With the instrument, he summons the spirits of the villagers' loved ones, who show the Moon Beast that memories are the strongest magic of all and can never be destroyed. Kubo and the spirits' magic protect themselves and the villagers from the Moon Beast, stripping him of his powers and leaving him a mortal human without any memories. Spurred on by Kubo's stories, the villagers take compassion and tell Raiden he was a man of many positive traits, accepting him into the village. Kubo is able to speak to his parents' ghosts during the subsequent Bon ceremony, as they watch the deceased villagers' lanterns transform into golden herons and fly to the spirit world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Art Parkinson]] as Kubo\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Monkey / Sariatu\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Beetle / Hanzo\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as Raiden the Moon King\n* [[Rooney Mara]] as Karasu and Washi the Sisters\n* [[George Takei]] as Hosato\n* [[Brenda Vaccaro]] as Kameyo\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as Hashi\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre.jpg|thumb|''[[Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre]]'' by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] inspired the giant skeleton.]]\nAnnounced in December 2014, the project is the directoral debut of Laika's CEO [[Travis Knight]].<ref name=\"Deadline1\">{{cite news|last1=Hammond|first1=Pete|title=Laika & Focus Begin Production On All-Star 'Kubo And The Two Strings' To Kick Off 3-Pic Deal|url=https://deadline.com/2014/12/laika-focus-three-picture-pact-kubo-and-the-two-strings-1201333450/|accessdate=January 15, 2015|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 22, 2014}}</ref> Laika's production designer [[Shannon Tindle]] pitched the story to Knight as a \"stop-motion samurai epic\".

Although there is no direct influence on his passion for music, he would often hear his mother, a classical pianist, play the family piano, favoring the composer [[Claude Debussy]]. He also took up recording from a young age, moving from 2- and 4-track analog tape to ADAT and eventually to DAWs ([[digital audio workstations]]).

He loves his wife Rose but has a very tense relationship with his wealthy, snobbish mother-in-law, Mrs. Monahan, who runs a successful department store chain and hates the way Monty acts and lives.

He and his best friend Nicholas 'Nicky' Cerone are smoking marijuana while driving, and an accident destroys the cake.\n\nAfter Mrs. Monahan dies unexpectedly, his family is in for an inheritance. Attorney Scrappleton reveals that Mrs. Monahan left a stipulation in her will that if Monty is able to curb his vices for a year by going on a diet and giving up drugs and gambling, he will receive $10 million. If not, the family gets nothing. Allison's wedding to Julio goes off without a hitch, at least until the wedding night. Monty's gambling and drinking buddies are also interested in whether or not Monty can really give up everything and bet whether or not he will make it.\n\nMonty and Nicky go to the mother-in-law's department store and find awkward fashions, catering to a clientele which clearly do not include the likes of Nicky and Monty. Nicky argues that it may not be worth it to Monty if this is the kind of atmosphere he will be exposed to, but Monty points out he must tough it out to provide for his wife and daughters, not just him. Meanwhile, Mrs. Monahan's scheming nephew Clive Barlow does his best to undermine Monty's resolve so the money and department store can instead be left to him.\n\nMonty ultimately reforms.
