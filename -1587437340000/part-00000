It is scheduled to take place on May 10, 2020. It will be the eleventh event under the [[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] chronology.\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place at the [[Royal Farms Arena]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], but the venue canceled all shows that were to be held in May [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports|due to the]] [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]. WWE announced that the show's [[Money in the Bank ladder match|eponymous ladder matches]] would take place at its \"[[Titan Towers]]\" global headquarters building in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] with a new \"Corporate Ladder\" gimmick culminating on the facility's roof. WWE has not yet announced where the card's remaining matches will originate.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Background ===\n[[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] (MITB) is an annual [[gimmick]] pay-per-view produced by WWE since 2010 and generally held between May and July. The concept of the show comes from WWE's established [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], in which multiple wrestlers use [[Ladder match|ladders]] to retrieve a briefcase hanging above the ring. The briefcase contains a contract that guarantees the winner a match for a world championship of their choosing at any time within the next year. Since the [[Money in the Bank (2018)|2018 event]], both the men's and women's matches featured eight wrestlers, evenly divided between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] [[WWE brand extension|brands]]. For 2020, it was reduced to six wrestlers divided between the brands. Male wrestlers compete for a contract to grant them a match for either Raw's [[WWE Championship]] or SmackDown's [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], while female wrestlers compete for a [[Raw Women's Championship]] or [[SmackDown Women's Championship]] match contract. 2020 will be the eleventh event in the Money in the Bank chronology.<ref name=\"2020event\"/>\n\n====Impact of the coronavirus pandemic====\nThe event was originally announced with [[Baltimore]]'s [[Royal Farms Arena]] as host.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambert|first=Jeremy|title=WWE Money In The Bank 2020 Scheduled For May 10 In Baltimore, MD|url=https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/wwe-money-bank-2020-scheduled-may-10-baltimore-md|work=Fightful|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"2020event\">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mike|title=WWE MONEY IN THE BANK 2020 DETAILS|url=https://pwinsider.com/article/134349/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2020-details.html?p=1|work=PWInsider|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> However, [[Maryland]] issued a [[stay at home order]] on March 30, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maryland to Enact Stay-at-Home Order Monday as Coronavirus Cases Top 1,400|last=Barnes|first=Sophia|url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-latest-monday-march-30-coronavirus-outbreak-covid-19-stay-at-home-order/2258161/|work=NBC4 Washington|date=March 30, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Subsequently on April 9, the host venue cancelled the event due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], and began issuing refunds.

It is scheduled to take place on May 10, 2020. It will be the eleventh event under the [[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] chronology.\n\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place at the [[Royal Farms Arena]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], but the venue canceled all shows that were to be held in May [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on sports|due to the]] [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]. WWE announced that the show's [[Money in the Bank ladder match|eponymous ladder matches]] would take place at its \"[[Titan Towers]]\" global headquarters building in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] with a new \"Corporate Ladder\" gimmick culminating on the facility's roof. WWE has not yet announced where the card's remaining matches will originate.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Background ===\n[[WWE Money in the Bank|Money in the Bank]] (MITB) is an annual [[gimmick]] pay-per-view produced by WWE since 2010 and generally held between May and July. The concept of the show comes from WWE's established [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], in which multiple wrestlers use [[Ladder match|ladders]] to retrieve a briefcase hanging above the ring. The briefcase contains a contract that guarantees the winner a match for a world championship of their choosing at any time within the next year. Since the [[Money in the Bank (2018)|2018 event]], both the men's and women's matches featured eight wrestlers, evenly divided between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] [[WWE brand extension|brands]]. For 2020, it was reduced to six wrestlers divided between the brands. Male wrestlers compete for a contract to grant them a match for either Raw's [[WWE Championship]] or SmackDown's [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]], while female wrestlers compete for a [[Raw Women's Championship]] or [[SmackDown Women's Championship]] match contract. 2020 will be the eleventh event in the Money in the Bank chronology.<ref name=\"2020event\"/>\n\n====Impact of the coronavirus pandemic====\nThe event was originally announced with [[Baltimore]]'s [[Royal Farms Arena]] as host.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambert|first=Jeremy|title=WWE Money In The Bank 2020 Scheduled For May 10 In Baltimore, MD|url=https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/wwe-money-bank-2020-scheduled-may-10-baltimore-md|work=Fightful|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"2020event\">{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Mike|title=WWE MONEY IN THE BANK 2020 DETAILS|url=https://pwinsider.com/article/134349/wwe-money-in-the-bank-2020-details.html?p=1|work=PWInsider|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> However, [[Maryland]] issued a [[stay at home order]] on March 30, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maryland to Enact Stay-at-Home Order Monday as Coronavirus Cases Top 1,400|last=Barnes|first=Sophia|url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/maryland-governor-larry-hogan-latest-monday-march-30-coronavirus-outbreak-covid-19-stay-at-home-order/2258161/|work=NBC4 Washington|date=March 30, 2020|access-date=April 9, 2020}}</ref> Subsequently on April 9, the host venue cancelled the event due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], and began issuing refunds.
