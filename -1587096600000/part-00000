Alonso Vargas y Abarca, continued by Bishop Fray Juan P\u00e9rez Carpintero and completed by Bishop Fray Antonio L\u00f3pez de Guadalupe, most of the construction work took place between 1685 and 1715 when it was solemnly blessed.\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n=== Inside ===\n[[File:Francisco De Ocampo.jpg|left|thumb|222x222px|Gold-plated altarpiece by Francisco de ocampo]]\nIt consists of a Latin cross plan with three naves with a barrel vault, with five sections, the presbytery is covered with three hemispherical domes. It has an annex where the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is located. On the main altar you can see a gilded wooden altarpiece, with a carving of the image of the Immaculate Conception made in 1620 by Francisco de Ocampo and donated to the city by King [[Philip III of Spain|Felipe III of Spain]]. The eight images that are distributed in the temple were donated by Felipe VI of Spain as well as the crucified one donated in 1620 and made by the Ja\u00e9n sculptor Andr\u00e9s Ocampo.\n\n\n<br />\n<br />\n=== Outside ===\n[[File:Cathedral Comayagua Honduras.jpg|thumb|Another View|alt=|left]]Outside, the fa\u00e7ade has a Renaissance style and is made in the form of an altarpiece with three streets, the central one wider where the semicircular arch entrance door is located. The streets are divided vertically by attached columns and horizontally by cornices forming four floors. Inside some niches of this facade, there are the images of four doctors of the Church in the side streets and in the central one, on the third floor, there are the statues of the Virgin Mary and on their sides Saint John the Baptist and Saint Joseph, finally on the fourth floor is the figure of Christ blessing. The four-story bell tower stands out on the left side of this main fa\u00e7ade, the last one is where the eight bells that it has are placed, later in its construction to the fa\u00e7ade, this bell tower is finished off with a glazed colored ceramic dome.\n<br />\n\n\n\n<br />\n==See also==\n*[[Roman Catholicism in Honduras]]\n*[[Comayagua]]\n*[[History of

it is one of the oldest cathedrals in [[Central America]], built from 1634 and inaugurated on December 8, 1711 and blessed in 1715.\n\nThe cathedral was initiated by the then Bishop of Comayagua  Alonso Vargas y Abarca, continued by Bishop Fray Juan P\u00e9rez Carpintero and completed by Bishop Fray Antonio L\u00f3pez de Guadalupe, most of the construction work took place between 1685 and 1715 when it was solemnly blessed.\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n=== Inside ===\n[[File:Francisco De Ocampo.jpg|left|thumb|222x222px|Gold-plated altarpiece by Francisco de ocampo]]\nIt consists of a Latin cross plan with three naves with a barrel vault, with five sections, the presbytery is covered with three hemispherical domes. It has an annex where the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is located. On the main altar you can see a gilded wooden altarpiece, with a carving of the image of the Immaculate Conception made in 1620 by Francisco de Ocampo and donated to the city by King Felipe III of Spain. The eight images that are distributed in the temple were donated by Felipe VI of Spain as well as the crucified one donated in 1620 and made by the Ja\u00e9n sculptor Andr\u00e9s Ocampo.\n\n\n<br />\n==== Outside ====\n[[File:Cathedral Comayagua Honduras.jpg|thumb|Another View|alt=|left]]Outside, the fa\u00e7ade has a Renaissance style and is made in the form of an altarpiece with three streets, the central one wider where the semicircular arch entrance door is located. The streets are divided vertically by attached columns and horizontally by cornices forming four floors. Inside some niches of this facade, there are the images of four doctors of the Church in the side streets and in the central one, on the third floor, there are the statues of the Virgin Mary and on their sides Saint John the Baptist and Saint Joseph, finally on the fourth floor is the figure of Christ blessing. The four-story bell tower stands out on the left side of this main fa\u00e7ade, the last one is where the eight bells that it has are placed, later in its construction to the fa\u00e7ade, this bell tower is finished off with a glazed colored ceramic dome\n<br />\n<br />\n==See also==\n*[[Roman Catholicism in Honduras]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{coord|14.4667|N|87.6500|W|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Church}}\n[[Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in Honduras]]\n[[Category:Comayagua]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1711]]\n[[Category:1711 establishments in the Spanish Empire]]\n", "name_user": "Luis Alfredo Romero", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immaculate_Conception_Cathedral,_Comayagua"}

Upon first seeing the photograph, sculptor [[Felix de Weldon]] created a [[maquette]] for a sculpture based on the photo in a single weekend at [[Patuxent River Naval Air Station]] in [[Maryland]], where he was serving in the Navy. He and architect Horace W. Peaslee designed the memorial. Their proposal was presented to Congress, but funding was not possible during the war. In 1947, a federal foundation was established to raise funds for the memorial.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, larger - edit1.jpg|thumb|The original photograph]]\n[[File:Iwo Jima Suribachi DN-SD-03-11845.JPEG|thumb|right|Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima.]]\n[[File:Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima (color).ogg|thumb|right|A portion of the color film shot of the second flag-raising on [[Mount Suribachi]] by Sgt.

The first flag flown over the mountain was regarded to be too small to be seen by all the American troops on the other side of it where most of the fighting would take place, so it was replaced by a larger flag.\n \nThe flag-raising also was recorded by Marine Sergeant [[Bill Genaust]], a combat motion picture cameraman. He filmed the event in color while standing beside Rosenthal. Genaust's footage established that the second flag raising was not staged. On March 4, 1945, he was killed by the Japanese after entering a cave on Iwo Jima and his remains have never been found.

De Weldon spent three years creating a full-sized master model in plaster, with figures {{convert|32|ft|m}} tall. This was disassembled like a giant puzzle, and each piece was separately cast in bronze. Peaslee's base for the memorial is made of black [[diabase]] granite from a [[quarry]] in [[L\u00f6nsboda]], a small town in the southernmost province of [[Sweden]].<ref>http://www.gemeneman.se/MinSommar2005.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820131338/http://www.gemeneman.se/MinSommar2005.pdf |date=August 20, 2010 }} (in Swedish) Translation, page 3 line 28-29: ''The most famous war memorial in the United States, U.S. Marine Corps Memorial in Washington D.C., stands on a base in granite pieces from H\u00e4gghult.''

The bronze pieces of the sculpture were assembled to Brooklyn, New York for casting in bronze. This took about 3 months to complete. After that, they were reassembled into a dozen pieces and were shipped back to Arlington, Virginia in a 3 truck convoy, to which was added a {{convert|60|ft|m}} flagpole. The total cost of the memorial was $850,000, including the development of the site. It was paid for with donations mostly from active duty Marines and Marine Reservists. Other donors included former Marines and friends of the Marine Corps and members of the Naval Service; no public funds were used.\n\nThe memorial was dedicated on Wednesday, November 10, 1954, the 179th anniversary of the founding of the Marine Corps.<ref name=mhmd/> The Presiding officials included [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D.

In 1947, a federal foundation was established to raise funds for the memorial.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, larger - edit1.jpg|thumb|The original photograph]]\n[[File:Iwo Jima Suribachi DN-SD-03-11845.JPEG|thumb|right|Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima.]]\n[[File:Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima (color).ogg|thumb|right|A portion of the color film shot of the second flag-raising on [[Mount Suribachi]] by Sgt.

The first flag flown over the mountain was regarded to be too small to be seen by all the American troops on the other side of it where most of the fighting would take place, so it was replaced by a larger flag.\n \nThe flag-raising also was recorded by Marine Sergeant [[Bill Genaust]], a combat motion picture cameraman. He filmed the event in color while standing beside Rosenthal. Genaust's footage established that the second flag raising was not staged. On March 4, 1945, he was killed by the Japanese after entering a cave on Iwo Jima and his remains have never been found.

De Weldon spent three years creating a full-sized master model in plaster, with figures {{convert|32|ft|m}} tall. This was disassembled like a giant puzzle, and each piece was separately cast in bronze. Peaslee's base for the memorial is made of black [[diabase]] granite from a [[quarry]] in [[L\u00f6nsboda]], a small town in the southernmost province of [[Sweden]].<ref>http://www.gemeneman.se/MinSommar2005.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820131338/http://www.gemeneman.se/MinSommar2005.pdf |date=August 20, 2010 }} (in Swedish) Translation, page 3 line 28-29: ''The most famous war memorial in the United States, U.S. Marine Corps Memorial in Washington D.C., stands on a base in granite pieces from H\u00e4gghult.''

The Groundbreaking ceremony was held on February 19, 1954, exactly nine years after the Marines landed on Iwo Jima. [[General (United States)|General]] [[Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr.|Lemuel Shepherd]], 20th [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant]] of the Marine Corps, did the groundbreaking. Construction of the memorial began in September. The bronze pieces of the sculpture were assembled to Brooklyn, New York for casting in bronze. This took about 3 months to complete. After that, they were reassembled into a dozen pieces and were shipped back to Arlington, Virginia in a 3 truck convoy, to which was added a {{convert|60|ft|m}} flagpole. The total cost of the memorial was $850,000, including the development of the site. It was paid for with donations mostly from active duty Marines and Marine Reservists. Other donors included former Marines and friends of the Marine Corps and members of the Naval Service; no public funds were used.\n\nThe memorial was dedicated on Wednesday, November 10, 1954, the 179th anniversary of the founding of the Marine Corps.<ref name=mhmd/> The Presiding officials included [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D.
