His novels explored biblical religious themes, or cultural identities in the South African context. He also examined relations between white and black more closely in ''Wit oemfaan'', which describes a white boy's discovery of the customs of the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] nation. ''Swart pelgrim'' on the other hand relates the experiences and observations of a migrant from a black rural setting to the industrialised, white-dominated environment. He may be best known for his novel ''Geknelde land'' ([[Afrikaans]] for Afflicted land), which describes the [[Eastern Cape]] [[Boer]] community living under [[Xhosa Wars|Xhosa raids]] and the English governance of the 19th century.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born in [[Hopetown, Northern Cape|Hopetown]], and grew up on his parents' farm in the [[Britstown]] district. He attended rural schools at first, before attending the Strydenburg Secondary School, and matriculating from Hopetown High School in 1934. He studied at the [[University of Stellenbosch]] and commenced a career as journalist in 1938.\n\n==Adult career==\nFor 25 years he worked as a journalist in Cape Town, Pretoria, Windhoek and Johannesburg.

His novels explored biblical religious themes, or cultural identities in the South African context. He also examined relations between white and black more closely in ''Wit oemfaan'', which describes a white boy's discovery of the customs of the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] nation. ''Swart pelgrim'' on the other hand relates the experiences and observations of a migrant from a black rural setting to the industrialised, white-dominated environment. He may be best known for his novel ''Geknelde land'' ([[Afrikaans]] for Afflicted land), which describes the [[Eastern Cape]] [[Boer]] community living under [[Xhosa Wars|Xhosa raids]] and the English governance of the 19th century.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born in [[Hopetown, Northern Cape|Hopetown]], and grew up on his parents' farm in the [[Britstown]] district. He attended rural schools at first, before attending the Strydenburg Secondary School, and matriculating from Hopetown High School in 1934. He studied at the [[University of Stellenbosch]] and commenced a career as journalist in 1938.\n\n==Adult career==\nFor 25 years he worked as a journalist in Cape Town, Pretoria, Windhoek and Johannesburg. He also wrote popular fiction, under the pseudonyms Meiring Fouch\u00e9, Elske te Water, Ren\u00e9 Stegmann and Marius de Jongh.<ref>John Christoffel Kannemeyer, ''Geskiedenis van die Afrikaanse literatuur'', 2 vols., Volume 2, 2nd ed.
