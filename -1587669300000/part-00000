The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. Academic definitions of the term ''genre ''itself vary. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and [[Musical form|form]]. He lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. To further clarify the meaning of ''genre'', Green writes, \"Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre\u2014both are violin concertos\u2014but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his Mass, K. 317, are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Form in Tonal Music|last=Green|first=Douglass M.|year=1965|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc|isbn=978-0-03-020286-5|page=1}}</ref> Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or \"basic musical language.\"<ref name=Pete>{{cite book|title=Origins of the Popular Style: The Antecedents of Twentieth-Century Popular Music|last=van der Merwe|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|year=1989|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-316121-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/originsofpopular0000vand/page/3 3]|url=https://archive.org/details/originsofpopular0000vand/page/3}}</ref> Others, such as Allan F.

Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that, since the early 1980s, \"genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.5130/csr.v20i2.4149 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511| title= Music Genre as Method| year= 2014| last1= Laurie| first1= Timothy| journal= Cultural Studies Review| volume= 20| issue= 2| doi-access= free}}</ref>\n\nMusicologists have sometimes classified music according to a trichotomous distinction such as Philip Tagg's \"axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics\".<ref name=\"Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41\">Tagg, Philip. \"Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice\". ''Popular Music'' 2 (1982): 41.</ref> He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria.<ref name=\"Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41\" />\n\nAlternatively, music can be assessed on the three dimensions of \"arousal\", \"valence\", and \"depth\".<ref name=\"ECON\">{{cite web|url=http://www.econotimes.com/Musical-genres-are-out-of-date-%E2%80%93-but-this-new-system-explains-why-you-might-like-both-jazz-and-hip-hop-244941|title=Musical genres are out of date \u2013 but this new system explains why you might like both jazz and hip hop|date=3 August 2016|publisher=Econotimes|accessdate=8 August 2016}}</ref> Arousal reflects physiological processes such as stimulation and relaxation (intense, forceful, abrasive, thrilling vs. gentle, calming, mellow), valence reflects emotion and mood processes (fun, happy, lively, enthusiastic, joyful vs. depressing, sad), and depth reflects cognitive processes (intelligent, sophisticated, inspiring, complex, poetic, deep, emotional, thoughtful vs. party music, danceable).<ref name=ECON/> These help explain why many people like similar songs from different traditionally segregated genres.<ref name=ECON/>\n\n==Art music==\n{{Main|Art music}}\n{{See also|List of art music traditions}}\n\nArt music primarily includes classical traditions, including both [[contemporary classical music|contemporary]] and historical classical music forms. Art music exists in many parts of the world. It emphasizes formal styles that invite technical and detailed deconstruction<ref>Siron, Jacques. \"Musique Savante (Serious Music)\". ''Dictionnaire des mots de la musique'' (Paris: Outre Mesure): 242.</ref> and criticism, and demand focused attention from the listener. In Western practice, art music is considered primarily a written musical tradition,<ref name=\"Arnold, Denis\">Arnold, Denis: \"Art Music, Art Song\", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J'' (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983): 111.</ref> preserved in some form of [[musical notation|music notation]] rather than being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings, as [[popular music|popular]] and [[traditional music]] usually are.<ref name=\"Arnold, Denis\"/><ref>Tagg, Philip. \"Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice\". ''Popular Music'' 2 (1982): 37\u201367, here 41\u201342.</ref> Historically, most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in Europe, beginning well before the Renaissance and reaching its maturity in the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] period. The identity of a \"work\" or \"piece\" of art music is usually defined by the notated version rather than by a particular performance and is primarily associated with the composer rather than the performer (though composers may leave performers with some opportunity for interpretation or improvisation). This is so particularly in the case of western classical music. Art music may include certain forms of [[jazz]], though some feel that jazz is primarily a form of popular music. The 1960s saw a wave of avant-garde experimentation in free [[jazz]], represented by artists such as [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Albert Ayler]], [[Archie Shepp]] and Don Cherry.<ref>Anon. [http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/avant-garde-jazz-ma0000002438 Avant-Garde Jazz].

Musicologist and popular music specialist Philip Tagg defined the notion in the light of sociocultural and economical aspects:\n\n<blockquote>Popular music, unlike art music, is (1) conceived for mass distribution to large and often socioculturally heterogeneous groups of listeners, (2) stored and distributed in non-written form, (3) only possible in an industrial monetary economy where it becomes a commodity and (4) in capitalist societies, subject to the laws of 'free' enterprise&nbsp;... it should ideally sell as much as possible.<ref name=\"Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41\"/></blockquote>\n\nPopular music is found on most commercial and [[public service]] radio stations, in most commercial music retailers and department stores, and movie and television soundtracks. It is noted on the [[Billboard charts|'' Billboard'' charts]] and, in addition to singer-songwriters and composers, it involves music producers more than other genres do.\n\nThe distinction between classical and popular music has sometimes been blurred in marginal areas<ref>Arnold, Denis (1983): \"Art Music, Art Song\", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J'', Oxford University Press, p. 111, {{ISBN|0-19-311316-3}}.</ref> such as [[minimalist music]] and light classics.

The [[genealogy of musical genres]] expresses, often in the form of a written chart, how new genres have developed under the influence of older ones.

The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. Academic definitions of the term ''genre ''itself vary. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and [[Musical form|form]]. He lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. To further clarify the meaning of ''genre'', Green writes, \"Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre\u2014both are violin concertos\u2014but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his Mass, K. 317, are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Form in Tonal Music|last=Green|first=Douglass M.|year=1965|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc|isbn=978-0-03-020286-5|page=1}}</ref> Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or \"basic musical language.\"<ref name=Pete>{{cite book|title=Origins of the Popular Style: The Antecedents of Twentieth-Century Popular Music|last=van der Merwe|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|year=1989|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-316121-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/originsofpopular0000vand/page/3 3]|url=https://archive.org/details/originsofpopular0000vand/page/3}}</ref> Others, such as Allan F.

Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that, since the early 1980s, \"genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.5130/csr.v20i2.4149 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511| title= Music Genre as Method| year= 2014| last1= Laurie| first1= Timothy| journal= Cultural Studies Review| volume= 20| issue= 2| doi-access= free}}</ref>\n\nMusicologists have sometimes classified music according to a trichotomous distinction such as Philip Tagg's \"axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics\".<ref name=\"Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41\">Tagg, Philip. \"Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice\". ''Popular Music'' 2 (1982): 41.</ref> He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria.<ref name=\"Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41\" />\n\nAlternatively, music can be assessed on the three dimensions of \"arousal\", \"valence\", and \"depth\".<ref name=\"ECON\">{{cite web|url=http://www.econotimes.com/Musical-genres-are-out-of-date-%E2%80%93-but-this-new-system-explains-why-you-might-like-both-jazz-and-hip-hop-244941|title=Musical genres are out of date \u2013 but this new system explains why you might like both jazz and hip hop|date=3 August 2016|publisher=Econotimes|accessdate=8 August 2016}}</ref> Arousal reflects physiological processes such as stimulation and relaxation (intense, forceful, abrasive, thrilling vs. gentle, calming, mellow), valence reflects emotion and mood processes (fun, happy, lively, enthusiastic, joyful vs. depressing, sad), and depth reflects cognitive processes (intelligent, sophisticated, inspiring, complex, poetic, deep, emotional, thoughtful vs. party music, danceable).<ref name=ECON/> These help explain why many people like similar songs from different traditionally segregated genres.<ref name=ECON/>\n\n==Art music==\n{{Main|Art music}}\n{{See also|List of art music traditions}}\n\nArt music primarily includes classical traditions, including both [[contemporary classical music|contemporary]] and historical classical music forms. Art music exists in many parts of the world. It emphasizes formal styles that invite technical and detailed deconstruction<ref>Siron, Jacques. \"Musique Savante (Serious Music)\". ''Dictionnaire des mots de la musique'' (Paris: Outre Mesure): 242.</ref> and criticism, and demand focused attention from the listener. In Western practice, art music is considered primarily a written musical tradition,<ref name=\"Arnold, Denis\">Arnold, Denis: \"Art Music, Art Song\", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J'' (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983): 111.</ref> preserved in some form of [[musical notation|music notation]] rather than being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings, as [[popular music|popular]] and [[traditional music]] usually are.<ref name=\"Arnold, Denis\"/><ref>Tagg, Philip. \"Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice\". ''Popular Music'' 2 (1982): 37\u201367, here 41\u201342.</ref> Historically, most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in Europe, beginning well before the Renaissance and reaching its maturity in the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] period. The identity of a \"work\" or \"piece\" of art music is usually defined by the notated version rather than by a particular performance and is primarily associated with the composer rather than the performer (though composers may leave performers with some opportunity for interpretation or improvisation). This is so particularly in the case of western classical music. Art music may include certain forms of [[jazz]], though some feel that jazz is primarily a form of popular music. The 1960s saw a wave of avant-garde experimentation in free [[jazz]], represented by artists such as [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Albert Ayler]], [[Archie Shepp]] and Don Cherry.<ref>Anon. [http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/avant-garde-jazz-ma0000002438 Avant-Garde Jazz].

Musicologist and popular music specialist Philip Tagg defined the notion in the light of sociocultural and economical aspects:\n\n<blockquote>Popular music, unlike art music, is (1) conceived for mass distribution to large and often socioculturally heterogeneous groups of listeners, (2) stored and distributed in non-written form, (3) only possible in an industrial monetary economy where it becomes a commodity and (4) in capitalist societies, subject to the laws of 'free' enterprise&nbsp;... it should ideally sell as much as possible.<ref name=\"Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41\"/></blockquote>\n\nPopular music is found on most commercial and [[public service]] radio stations, in most commercial music retailers and department stores, and movie and television soundtracks. It is noted on the [[Billboard charts|'' Billboard'' charts]] and, in addition to singer-songwriters and composers, it involves music producers more than other genres do.\n\nThe distinction between classical and popular music has sometimes been blurred in marginal areas<ref>Arnold, Denis (1983): \"Art Music, Art Song\", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J'', Oxford University Press, p. 111, {{ISBN|0-19-311316-3}}.</ref> such as [[minimalist music]] and light classics.

Oberth effect occurs because the [[propellant]] has more usable energy (due to its kinetic energy on top of its chemical potential energy) and it turns out that the vehicle is able to employ this kinetic energy to generate more mechanical power. It is named after [[Hermann Oberth]], the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-born, [[Germany|German]] [[physicist]] and a founder of modern [[rocket]]ry, who apparently first described the effect.<ref name=ways>[http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19720008133 NASA-TT-F-622: Ways to spaceflight p 200 - Herman Oberth]</ref>\n\nOberth effect is used in a '''powered flyby''' or '''Oberth maneuver''' where the application of an impulse, typically from the use of a rocket engine, close to a gravitational body (where the [[gravity potential]] is low, and the speed is high) can give much more change in [[kinetic energy]] and final speed (i.e. higher [[specific energy]]) than the same impulse applied further from the body for the same initial orbit. \n\nSince the Oberth maneuver happens in a very limited time (while still at low altitude), to generate a high impulse the engine necessarily needs to achieve high thrust (impulse is by definition the time multiplied by thrust). Thus the Oberth effect is far less useful for low-thrust engines, such as [[ion thruster]]s.\n\nHistorically, a lack of understanding of this effect led investigators to conclude that interplanetary travel would require completely impractical amounts of propellant, as without it, enormous amounts of energy are needed.<ref name=ways/>\n\n====Gravitational assist====\n{{main|Gravity assist}}\n[[Image:Voyager Path.svg|thumb|The trajectories that enabled NASA's twin Voyager spacecraft to tour the four gas giant planets and achieve velocity to escape our solar system]]\nIn [[orbital mechanics]] and [[aerospace engineering]], a '''gravitational slingshot''', '''gravity assist maneuver''', or '''swing-by''' is the use of the relative movement and [[gravity]] of a [[planet]] or other celestial body to alter the [[Course (navigation)|path]] and [[speed]] of a [[spacecraft]], typically in order to save [[propellant]], [[time]], and expense. Gravity assistance can be used to [[accelerate]], [[deceleration|decelerate]] and/or re-direct the path of a spacecraft.\n\nThe \"assist\" is provided by the motion (orbital [[angular momentum]]) of the gravitating body as it pulls on the spacecraft.<ref>http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf4-1.php  Basics of Space Flight, Sec. 1 Ch. 4,  NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ref> The technique was first proposed as a mid-course manoeuvre in 1961, and used by interplanetary probes from ''[[Mariner 10]]'' onwards, including the two ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' probes' notable fly-bys of Jupiter and Saturn.\n\n==Transfer orbits==\n[[Orbit insertion]] is a general term for a maneuver that is more than a small correction. It may be used for a maneuver to change a [[transfer orbit]] or an ascent orbit into a stable one, but also to change a stable orbit into a descent: ''descent orbit insertion''. Also the term '''orbit injection''' is used, especially for changing a stable orbit into a transfer orbit, e.g. [[trans-lunar injection]] (TLI), [[trans-Mars injection]] (TMI) and [[trans-Earth injection]] (TEI).\n\n===Hohmann transfer===\n[[Image:Hohmann transfer orbit.svg|thumb|Hohmann Transfer Orbit]]\n{{main|Hohmann transfer orbit}}\nIn [[orbital mechanics]], the '''Hohmann transfer orbit''' is an elliptical orbit used to transfer between two [[circular orbit]]s of different altitudes, in the same [[Plane (geometry)|plane]].\n\nThe orbital maneuver to perform the Hohmann transfer uses two engine impulses which move a [[spacecraft]] onto and off the transfer orbit. This maneuver was named after [[Walter Hohmann]], the [[Germany|German]] scientist who published  a description of it in his 1925 book ''Die Erreichbarkeit der Himmelsk\u00f6rper'' (''The Accessibility of Celestial Bodies'').<ref>Walter Hohmann, ''The Attainability of Heavenly Bodies'' (Washington: NASA Technical Translation F-44, 1960) [https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19980230631 Internet Archive].</ref> Hohmann was influenced in part by the German science fiction author [[Kurd La\u00dfwitz]] and his 1897 book ''[[Two Planets]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n===Bi-elliptic transfer===\n[[File:Bi-elliptic transfer.svg|thumb|Bi-elliptic transfer from blue to red circular orbit]]\n{{main|Bi-elliptic transfer}}\nIn [[astronautics]] and [[aerospace engineering]], the '''bi-elliptic transfer''' is an orbital maneuver that moves a [[spacecraft]] from one [[orbit]] to another and may, in certain situations, require less [[delta-v]] than a [[Hohmann transfer orbit|Hohmann transfer]] maneuver.\n\nThe bi-elliptic transfer consists of two half [[elliptic orbit]]s. From the initial orbit, a delta-v is applied boosting the spacecraft into the first transfer orbit with an [[apoapsis]] at some point <math>r_b</math> away from the [[central body]]. At this point, a second delta-v is applied sending the spacecraft into the second elliptical orbit with [[periapsis]] at the radius of the final desired orbit, where a third delta-v is performed, injecting the spacecraft into the desired orbit.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nWhile they require one more engine burn than a Hohmann transfer and generally requires a greater travel time, some bi-elliptic transfers require a lower amount of total delta-v than a Hohmann transfer when the ratio of final to initial [[semi-major axis]] is 11.94 or greater, depending on the intermediate semi-major axis chosen.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Vallado | first = David Anthony | title = Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications | page = 317 | publisher = Springer | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-7923-6903-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PJLlWzMBKjkC&printsec}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of the bi-elliptical transfer trajectory was first published by [[Ary Sternfeld]] in 1934.<ref>Sternfeld A., Sur les trajectoires permettant d'approcher d'un corps attractif central \u00e0 partir d'une orbite kepl\u00e9rienne donn\u00e9e. - Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences (Paris), vol. 198, pp. 711 - 713.</ref>\n\n===Low energy transfer===\n{{main|low energy transfer}}\nA '''low energy transfer''', or low energy [[trajectory]], is a route in space which allows spacecraft to change [[orbit]]s using very little fuel.<ref name=Capture>{{cite book|last=Belbruno|first=Edward|authorlink= Edward Belbruno |title=Capture Dynamics and Chaotic Motions in Celestial Mechanics: With Applications to the Construction of Low Energy Transfers|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2004|pages=224|isbn=978-0-691-09480-9|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7687.html}}</ref><ref name=FlyMe>{{cite book|last=Belbruno|first=Edward|authorlink=Edward Belbruno|title=Fly Me to the Moon: An Insider's Guide to the New Science of Space Travel|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2007|pages=[https://archive.org/details/flymetomoonusing00belb/page/176 176]|isbn=978-0-691-12822-1|url=https://archive.org/details/flymetomoonusing00belb/page/176|url-access=registration}}</ref> These routes work in the [[Earth]]-[[Moon]] system and also in other systems, such as traveling between the [[satellites of Jupiter]]. The drawback of such trajectories is that they take much longer to complete than higher energy (more fuel) transfers such as [[Hohmann transfer orbit]]s.\n\nLow energy transfer are also known as weak stability boundary trajectories, or ballistic capture trajectories.\n\nLow energy transfers follow special pathways in space, sometimes referred to as the [[Interplanetary Transport Network]].  Following these pathways allows for long distances to be traversed for little expenditure of [[delta-v]].\n\n===Orbital inclination change===\n{{main|orbital inclination change}}\n'''Orbital inclination change''' is an orbital maneuver aimed at changing the [[inclination]] of an orbiting body's [[orbit]]. This maneuver is also known as an orbital plane change as the plane of the orbit is tipped. This maneuver requires a change in the orbital velocity vector ([[delta v]]) at the [[orbital nodes]] (i.e. the point where the initial and desired orbits intersect, the line of orbital nodes is defined by the intersection of the two orbital planes).\n\nIn general, inclination changes can require a great deal of delta-v to perform, and most mission planners try to avoid them whenever possible to conserve fuel. This is typically achieved by launching a spacecraft directly into the desired inclination, or as close to it as possible so as to minimize any inclination change required over the duration of the spacecraft life.\n\nMaximum efficiency of inclination change is achieved at [[apoapsis]], (or [[apogee]]), where orbital velocity <math>v\\,</math> is the lowest. In some cases, it may require less total delta v to raise the satellite into a higher orbit, change the orbit plane at the higher apogee, and then lower the satellite to its original altitude.<ref name=Braeunig>{{cite web |url=http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm#maneuver |title=Basics of Space Flight: Orbital Mechanics |last=Braeunig |first=Robert A}}</ref>\n\n===Constant-thrust trajectory===\nConstant-thrust and [[Space travel using constant acceleration|constant-acceleration]] trajectories involve the spacecraft firing its engine in a prolonged constant burn. In the limiting case where the vehicle acceleration is high compared to the local gravitational acceleration, the spacecraft points straight toward the target (accounting for target motion), and remains accelerating constantly under high thrust until it reaches its target. In this high-thrust case, the trajectory approaches a straight line.  If it is required that the spacecraft rendezvous with the target, rather than performing a flyby, then the spacecraft must flip its orientation halfway through the journey, and decelerate the rest of the way.\n\nIn the constant-thrust trajectory,<ref>W. E. Moeckel, [https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19980223074 Trajectories with Constant Tangential Thrust in Central Gravitational Fields], ''Technical Report R-63'', NASA Lewis Research Center, 1960 (accessed 26 March 2014)</ref> the vehicle's acceleration increases during thrusting period, since the fuel use means the vehicle mass decreases.  If, instead of constant thrust, the vehicle has constant acceleration, the engine thrust must decrease during the trajectory. \n\nThis trajectory requires that the spacecraft maintain a high acceleration for long durations. For interplanetary transfers, days, weeks or months of constant thrusting may be required. As a result, there are no currently available spacecraft propulsion systems capable of using this trajectory. It has been suggested that some forms of nuclear (fission or fusion based) or antimatter powered rockets would be capable of this trajectory.\n\nMore practically, this type of maneuver is used in low thrust maneuvers, for example with [[ion engines]], [[Hall-effect thruster|Hall-effect thrusters]], and others.  These types of engines have very high specific impulse (fuel efficiency) but currently are only available with fairly low absolute thrust.\n\n==Rendezvous and docking==\n\n===Orbit phasing===\n{{main|Orbit phasing}}\nIn [[astrodynamics]] '''orbit phasing''' is the adjustment of the time-position of spacecraft along its [[orbit]], usually described as adjusting the orbiting spacecraft's [[true anomaly]].\n\n===Space rendezvous and docking===\n{{main|Space rendezvous}}\n[[Image:Gemini 7 in orbit - GPN-2006-000035.jpg|thumb|upright|Gemini 7 photographed from Gemini 6 in 1965]]\nA '''space rendezvous''' is an orbital maneuver during which two [[spacecraft]], one of which is often a [[space station]], arrive at the same [[orbit]] and approach to a very close distance (e.g. within visual contact). Rendezvous requires a precise match of the [[orbital speed|orbital velocities]] of the two spacecraft, allowing them to remain at a constant distance through [[orbital station-keeping]]. Rendezvous may or may not be followed by [[Spacecraft Docking and Berthing Mechanisms|docking or berthing]], procedures which bring the spacecraft into physical contact and create a link between them.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[Collision avoidance (spacecraft)]]\n* [[In-space propulsion technologies]]\n* [[Clohessy-Wiltshire equations]] for co-orbit analysis\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521089869 Handbook Automated Rendezvous and Docking of Spacecraft] by [[Wigbert Fehse]]\n\n{{Orbits}}\n\n{{Use American English|date=January 2014}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Orbital Maneuver}}\n[[Category:Astrodynamics]]\n[[Category:Orbital maneuvers| ]]\n", "text_old": "In [[spaceflight]], an '''orbital maneuver''' (otherwise known as a '''burn''') is the use of [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] systems to change the [[orbit]] of a [[spacecraft]]. \nFor spacecraft far from Earth (for example those in orbits around the Sun) an orbital maneuver is called a ''deep-space maneuver (DSM)''.{{citation needed (lead)|date=September 2011}}\n\nThe rest of the flight, especially in a [[transfer orbit]], is called ''coasting''.\n\n==General==\n\n===Rocket equation===\n{{main|Tsiolkovsky rocket equation}}\n[[File:Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.svg|thumb|Rocket [[mass ratio]]s versus final velocity calculated from the rocket equation]]\nThe '''Tsiolkovsky rocket equation''', or '''ideal rocket equation''' is an equation that is useful for considering vehicles that follow the basic principle of a [[rocket]]: where a device that can apply acceleration to itself (a [[thrust]]) by expelling part of its mass with high speed and moving due to the conservation of [[momentum]].

Gravity assistance can be used to [[accelerate]], [[deceleration|decelerate]] and/or re-direct the path of a spacecraft.\n\nThe \"assist\" is provided by the motion (orbital [[angular momentum]]) of the gravitating body as it pulls on the spacecraft.<ref>http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf4-1.php  Basics of Space Flight, Sec. 1 Ch. 4,  NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory</ref> The technique was first proposed as a mid-course manoeuvre in 1961, and used by interplanetary probes from ''[[Mariner 10]]'' onwards, including the two ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' probes' notable fly-bys of Jupiter and Saturn.\n\n==Transfer orbits==\n[[Orbit insertion]] is a general term for a maneuver that is more than a small correction. It may be used for a maneuver to change a [[transfer orbit]] or an ascent orbit into a stable one, but also to change a stable orbit into a descent: ''descent orbit insertion''. Also the term '''orbit injection''' is used, especially for changing a stable orbit into a transfer orbit, e.g. [[trans-lunar injection]] (TLI), [[trans-Mars injection]] (TMI) and [[trans-Earth injection]] (TEI).\n\n===Hohmann transfer===\n[[Image:Hohmann transfer orbit.svg|thumb|Hohmann Transfer Orbit]]\n{{main|Hohmann transfer orbit}}\nIn [[orbital mechanics]], the '''Hohmann transfer orbit''' is an elliptical orbit used to transfer between two [[circular orbit]]s of different altitudes, in the same [[Plane (geometry)|plane]].\n\nThe orbital maneuver to perform the Hohmann transfer uses two engine impulses which move a [[spacecraft]] onto and off the transfer orbit. This maneuver was named after [[Walter Hohmann]], the [[Germany|German]] scientist who published  a description of it in his 1925 book ''Die Erreichbarkeit der Himmelsk\u00f6rper'' (''The Accessibility of Celestial Bodies'').<ref>Walter Hohmann, ''The Attainability of Heavenly Bodies'' (Washington: NASA Technical Translation F-44, 1960) [https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19980230631 Internet Archive].</ref> Hohmann was influenced in part by the German science fiction author [[Kurd La\u00dfwitz]] and his 1897 book ''[[Two Planets]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n===Bi-elliptic transfer===\n[[File:Bi-elliptic transfer.svg|thumb|Bi-elliptic transfer from blue to red circular orbit]]\n{{main|Bi-elliptic transfer}}\nIn [[astronautics]] and [[aerospace engineering]], the '''bi-elliptic transfer''' is an orbital maneuver that moves a [[spacecraft]] from one [[orbit]] to another and may, in certain situations, require less [[delta-v]] than a [[Hohmann transfer orbit|Hohmann transfer]] maneuver.\n\nThe bi-elliptic transfer consists of two half [[elliptic orbit]]s. From the initial orbit, a delta-v is applied boosting the spacecraft into the first transfer orbit with an [[apoapsis]] at some point <math>r_b</math> away from the [[central body]]. At this point, a second delta-v is applied sending the spacecraft into the second elliptical orbit with [[periapsis]] at the radius of the final desired orbit, where a third delta-v is performed, injecting the spacecraft into the desired orbit.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nWhile they require one more engine burn than a Hohmann transfer and generally requires a greater travel time, some bi-elliptic transfers require a lower amount of total delta-v than a Hohmann transfer when the ratio of final to initial [[semi-major axis]] is 11.94 or greater, depending on the intermediate semi-major axis chosen.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Vallado | first = David Anthony | title = Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications | page = 317 | publisher = Springer | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-7923-6903-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PJLlWzMBKjkC&printsec}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of the bi-elliptical transfer trajectory was first published by [[Ary Sternfeld]] in 1934.<ref>Sternfeld A., Sur les trajectoires permettant d'approcher d'un corps attractif central \u00e0 partir d'une orbite kepl\u00e9rienne donn\u00e9e. - Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences (Paris), vol. 198, pp. 711 - 713.</ref>\n\n===Low energy transfer===\n{{main|low energy transfer}}\nA '''low energy transfer''', or low energy [[trajectory]], is a route in space which allows spacecraft to change [[orbit]]s using very little fuel.<ref name=Capture>{{cite book|last=Belbruno|first=Edward|authorlink= Edward Belbruno |title=Capture Dynamics and Chaotic Motions in Celestial Mechanics: With Applications to the Construction of Low Energy Transfers|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2004|pages=224|isbn=978-0-691-09480-9|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7687.html}}</ref><ref name=FlyMe>{{cite book|last=Belbruno|first=Edward|authorlink=Edward Belbruno|title=Fly Me to the Moon: An Insider's Guide to the New Science of Space Travel|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2007|pages=[https://archive.org/details/flymetomoonusing00belb/page/176 176]|isbn=978-0-691-12822-1|url=https://archive.org/details/flymetomoonusing00belb/page/176|url-access=registration}}</ref> These routes work in the [[Earth]]-[[Moon]] system and also in other systems, such as traveling between the [[satellites of Jupiter]]. The drawback of such trajectories is that they take much longer to complete than higher energy (more fuel) transfers such as [[Hohmann transfer orbit]]s.\n\nLow energy transfer are also known as weak stability boundary trajectories, or ballistic capture trajectories.\n\nLow energy transfers follow special pathways in space, sometimes referred to as the [[Interplanetary Transport Network]].  Following these pathways allows for long distances to be traversed for little expenditure of [[delta-v]].\n\n===Orbital inclination change===\n{{main|orbital inclination change}}\n'''Orbital inclination change''' is an orbital maneuver aimed at changing the [[inclination]] of an orbiting body's [[orbit]]. This maneuver is also known as an orbital plane change as the plane of the orbit is tipped. This maneuver requires a change in the orbital velocity vector ([[delta v]]) at the [[orbital nodes]] (i.e. the point where the initial and desired orbits intersect, the line of orbital nodes is defined by the intersection of the two orbital planes).\n\nIn general, inclination changes can require a great deal of delta-v to perform, and most mission planners try to avoid them whenever possible to conserve fuel. This is typically achieved by launching a spacecraft directly into the desired inclination, or as close to it as possible so as to minimize any inclination change required over the duration of the spacecraft life.\n\nMaximum efficiency of inclination change is achieved at [[apoapsis]], (or [[apogee]]), where orbital velocity <math>v\\,</math> is the lowest. In some cases, it may require less total delta v to raise the satellite into a higher orbit, change the orbit plane at the higher apogee, and then lower the satellite to its original altitude.<ref name=Braeunig>{{cite web |url=http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm#maneuver |title=Basics of Space Flight: Orbital Mechanics |last=Braeunig |first=Robert A}}</ref>\n\n===Constant-thrust trajectory===\nConstant-thrust and [[Space travel using constant acceleration|constant-acceleration]] trajectories involve the spacecraft firing its engine in a prolonged constant burn. In the limiting case where the vehicle acceleration is high compared to the local gravitational acceleration, the spacecraft points straight toward the target (accounting for target motion), and remains accelerating constantly under high thrust until it reaches its target. In this high-thrust case, the trajectory approaches a straight line.  If it is required that the spacecraft rendezvous with the target, rather than performing a flyby, then the spacecraft must flip its orientation halfway through the journey, and decelerate the rest of the way.\n\nIn the constant-thrust trajectory,<ref>W. E. Moeckel, [https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19980223074 Trajectories with Constant Tangential Thrust in Central Gravitational Fields], ''Technical Report R-63'', NASA Lewis Research Center, 1960 (accessed 26 March 2014)</ref> the vehicle's acceleration increases during thrusting period, since the fuel use means the vehicle mass decreases.  If, instead of constant thrust, the vehicle has constant acceleration, the engine thrust must decrease during the trajectory. \n\nThis trajectory requires that the spacecraft maintain a high acceleration for long durations. For interplanetary transfers, days, weeks or months of constant thrusting may be required. As a result, there are no currently available spacecraft propulsion systems capable of using this trajectory. It has been suggested that some forms of nuclear (fission or fusion based) or antimatter powered rockets would be capable of this trajectory.\n\nMore practically, this type of maneuver is used in low thrust maneuvers, for example with [[ion engines]], [[Hall effect engines]], and others.  These types of engines have very high specific impulse (fuel efficiency) but currently are only available with fairly low absolute thrust.\n\n==Rendezvous and docking==\n\n===Orbit phasing===\n{{main|Orbit phasing}}\nIn [[astrodynamics]] '''orbit phasing''' is the adjustment of the time-position of spacecraft along its [[orbit]], usually described as adjusting the orbiting spacecraft's [[true anomaly]].\n\n===Space rendezvous and docking===\n{{main|Space rendezvous}}\n[[Image:Gemini 7 in orbit - GPN-2006-000035.jpg|thumb|upright|Gemini 7 photographed from Gemini 6 in 1965]]\nA '''space rendezvous''' is an orbital maneuver during which two [[spacecraft]], one of which is often a [[space station]], arrive at the same [[orbit]] and approach to a very close distance (e.g. within visual contact). Rendezvous requires a precise match of the [[orbital speed|orbital velocities]] of the two spacecraft, allowing them to remain at a constant distance through [[orbital station-keeping]]. Rendezvous may or may not be followed by [[Spacecraft Docking and Berthing Mechanisms|docking or berthing]], procedures which bring the spacecraft into physical contact and create a link between them.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[Collision avoidance (spacecraft)]]\n* [[In-space propulsion technologies]]\n* [[Clohessy-Wiltshire equations]] for co-orbit analysis\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521089869 Handbook Automated Rendezvous and Docking of Spacecraft] by [[Wigbert Fehse]]\n\n{{Orbits}}\n\n{{Use American English|date=January 2014}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Orbital Maneuver}}\n[[Category:Astrodynamics]]\n[[Category:Orbital maneuvers| ]]\n", "name_user": "OofPoof", "label": "safe", "comment": "Changed Hall Effect Engine to Hall-effect thusters and linked it", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_maneuver"}

For instance, Roomba's sensors can detect the presence of obstacles, detect dirty spots on the floor, and sense steep drops to keep it from falling down stairs. Roomba uses two independently operating side wheels, that allow 360\u00b0 turns in place. A rotating, 3-pronged spinner [[brush]] can sweep debris from square corners to the cleaning head.\n\nThe Roomba units have a range of model sizes with the 400 to 900 series, which provide several different features, such as tangle-free brushes, separate sweep [[Cylindrical|canister]], a more powerful vacuum, obstacle avoidance, or [[performance map]]s displayed via a [[smartphone app]]. However, some parts of the Roomba models are interchangeable between related models, allowing a mix/match of features, or switching into other units for longer battery operation. The 900 series Roombas also feature a camera, which works in conjunction with onboard mapping, [[indoor positioning system]] and navigation software, to systematically cover all floor area, move from room to room and find recharging bases and beacons. \n\nAdditionally, some Roomba units can adapt to perform other, more creative tasks, using an embedded computer in conjunction with the Roomba Open Interface.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Roomba parts.jpg|thumb|right|Various Roomba internal parts]]\n[[File:RoombaRecharging.jpg|thumb|Roomba recharging.]]\nMost Roomba models are disc-shaped, 34&nbsp;cm (13\") in diameter and less than 9&nbsp;cm (3.5\") high. A large contact-sensing mechanical bumper is mounted on the front half of the unit, with an omnidirectional [[infrared]] sensor at its top front center. A recessed carrying handle is fitted on the top of most units.<ref name=\"Roomba 560 Video Review\">{{cite web |title= iRobot Roomba 560 Video Review |url= http://www.robotreviews.com/reviews/roomba-560-video-review |publisher= Robot Reviews |access-date= 18 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2016, there have been seven generations of Roomba units: The first-generation Original Series, the second-generation 400 and Discovery Series, the third-generation Professional and 500 Series, the fourth-generation 600 Series, the fifth-generation 700 Series, the sixth-generation 800 Series, and the seventh-generation 980 model.<ref name=\"iRobot Store\">{{cite web|title=iRobot Store|url=http://store.irobot.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=2174944|publisher=iRobot|access-date=30 May 2015}}</ref> All models have a pair of brushes, rotating in opposite directions, to pick up debris from the floor. In most models, the brushes are followed by a [[squeegee]] vacuum, which directs the airflow through a narrow slit to increase its speed in order to collect fine dust. A horizontally mounted \"side spinner\" brush on the right side of the unit sweeps against walls to reach debris not accessible by the main brushes and vacuum. In the first generation of robots, the dirty air passes through the fan before reaching the filter, while later models use a fan-bypass vacuum.\n\nThe Roomba is powered by a removable [[Nickel\u2013metal hydride battery|NiMH battery]], which must be recharged from a wall power adapter. Newer second- and third-generation models have a self-charging homebase that the unit seeks out at the end of a cleaning session via infrared beacons. Charging on the homebase takes about three hours. Four infrared \"cliff sensors\" on the bottom of the Roomba prevent it from falling off ledges such as stairways or entering black carpet areas. Most second- and third-generation models have internal acoustic-based dirt sensors that allow them to detect particularly dirty spots and focus on those areas accordingly. Fourth-generation models have an optical sensor located in front of the vacuum bin, allowing detection of wider and smaller messes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uksupport.irobot.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1048/related/1/?cc=uk |title=What is Roomba's Dirt Detect technology? |publisher=Uksupport.irobot.com |date= |access-date=2013-01-29}}</ref> Many second- and third-generation Roombas come packaged with infrared remote controls, allowing a human operator to \"drive\" the robot to areas to be specially cleaned.\n\nSome higher-end 500, 700 and 800 series robots are compatible with Virtual Wall Lighthouses,<ref name=Aaron>[http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2007/tc20070821_419619.htm?technology+product+review]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915171122/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2007/tc20070821_419619.htm?technology+product+review |date=September 15, 2011 }}</ref> which use radio signals to communicate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://homesupport.irobot.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/7283/~/overview-of-the-virtual-wall%C2%AE%C2%A0lighthouse%E2%84%A2.|title=Find Answers {{!}} iRobot Customer Care|website=homesupport.irobot.com|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> These more advanced accessories confine a Roomba to a fixed area to be cleaned, yet allow the robot to later proceed to the next space which needs to be cleaned.<ref name=Lighthouse>{{cite web|title=What are Roomba Virtual Walls?|url=http://homesupport.irobot.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/486|work=iRobot Customer Care|publisher=iRobot|access-date=2012-03-04}}</ref>\n\nThere are several types of dust and debris collection bins for the 500 series robots. The standard vacuum bin incorporates a squeegee vacuum.  The high-capacity sweeper bin does not include a vacuum, but has greater debris capacity. The Aerovac Bin directs suction airflow through the main brushes instead of using a squeegee, which is thought to keep the brushes cleaner.\n\n== Operation ==\n[[File:Roomba time-lapse.jpg|thumb|Long exposure photo showing path taken by a Roomba as it cleans]]\nAll Roomba models can be operated by manually carrying them to the room to be cleaned and pressing a button. Later models introduced several additional operating modes. \"Clean\" mode is the normal cleaning program, starting in a spiral and then following a wall, until the room is determined to be clean. \"Spot\" mode cleans a small area using an outward-then-inward spiral. \"Max\" mode runs the standard cleaning algorithm until the battery is depleted. \"Dock\" mode, introduced with the third generation, instructs the robot to seek a charging base for recharging. The availability of the modes varies by model.\n\nThe robot's bumper allows it to sense when it has bumped into an obstacle, after which it will reverse or change paths. The third- and fourth-generations, which move faster than previous models, have additional forward-looking infrared sensors to detect obstacles. These slow down the robot when nearing obstacles, to reduce its force of impact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homesupport.irobot.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/960/~/roomba%E2%AE-500%2F600%2F700-series-light-touch-technology |title=iRobot: Customer Care - Roomba 500/600/700 Series Light Touch Technology |publisher=Homesupport.irobot.com |date= |access-date=2013-01-29}}</ref> This technology is also able to distinguish between hard and soft obstacles. After enough time cleaning or as the battery runs down, the Roomba will either search for and dock with the base, or stop where it is.\n\nThe cleaning time depends on room size and, for models equipped with dirt sensors, volume of dirt. First-generation models must be told the room size, while second- and third-generation models estimate room size by measuring the longest straight-line run they can perform without bumping into an object. When finished cleaning, or when the battery is nearly depleted, a second- or third-generation Roomba will try to return to a base if one is detected. A second-generation Roomba may also be used with a scheduler accessory, allowing cleaning to start at the time of day and on days of the week that the owner desires. Most 500 Series robots support scheduling through buttons on the unit itself, and higher-end models allow the use of a remote to program schedules.\n\nEarly generation Roombas do not map out the rooms they are cleaning. Instead, iRobot developed a technology called iAdapt Responsive Cleaning Technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irobot.com/EngineeringAwesome/images/iAdapt+Fast+Facts.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=11 May 2013|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511232754/http://www.irobot.com/EngineeringAwesome/images/iAdapt%20Fast%20Facts.pdf|archivedate=11 May 2013}}</ref> Roombas rely on a few simple algorithms, such as spiral cleaning (spiraling), room crossing, wall-following and [[random walk]] angle-changing after bumping into an object or wall. This design is based on MIT researcher and iRobot CTO [[Rodney Brooks]]' philosophy that robots should be like insects, equipped with simple control mechanisms tuned to their environments. The result is that although Roombas are effective at cleaning rooms, they take several times longer to do the job than a human would. The Roomba may cover some areas many times, and other areas only once or twice. The virtual wall accessories project beams, which the Roomba will not cross.\n\nThe Roomba is not designed for deep-pile carpet.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Also, the first- and second-generation Roombas can get stuck on rug tassels and electrical cords.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} The third-generation is able to reverse its brushes to escape entangled cords and tassels. Additionally, all models are designed to be low enough to go under a bed or most other items of furniture. If at any time the unit senses that it has become stuck, no longer senses the floor beneath it, or it decides that it has worked its way into a narrow area from which it is unable to escape, it stops and sounds an error to help someone find it.  Early models use only flashing lights to indicate specific problems, while later models use a [[Speech synthesis|synthesized voice]] to announce a problem and a suggested solution.<ref name=Stuck>{{cite web|title=How can I prevent Roomba from getting stuck?|url=http://homesupport.irobot.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/62/p/788|work=iRobot Customer Care|publisher=iRobot|access-date=2012-03-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Battery life ===\nBattery reliability is a frequently mentioned complaint on customer review websites.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Battery replacements from iRobot cost a significant fraction of the purchase price of a new Roomba, though compatible third-party batteries are available at a lower price.

The first-generation units comprised the original silver-colored Roomba, the blue Roomba Pro, and the maroon Roomba Pro Elite. The later two models included additional accessories, but all three used the same core robot and cleaning system. The second-generation Roombas (\"Discovery\", later called 400 series) replaced their predecessors in July 2004, added a larger dust bin, improved software that calculates room size, dirt detection, and fast charging in the home base.\n\nRoomba budget models (Dirt Dog and Model 401) used a simplified interface (a single button) and lacked some of the software-controlled flexibility of other versions. They were less expensive models intended for first-time purchasers. The Roomba Dirt Dog contained sweeping brushes and a larger dust bin, but lacked the vacuum motor, using the space that would be required for the vacuum for additional dust bin volume. It was designed for a home shop or garage environment.<ref name=Aaron /> The Roomba Model 401 was similar but had a standard-size dust bin and vacuum system. The Dirt Dog was discontinued in 2010.\n\n=== 500 and 600 series ===\nThe third-generation 500 series Roomba was introduced in August 2007<ref name=Aaron /> and featured a forward-looking infrared sensor to detect obstacles and reduce speed, a docking command button, improved mechanical components, smoother operation, and a modular design to facilitate part replacement.<ref name=Aaron /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://homesupport.irobot.com/cgi-bin/irobot_homesupport.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=136&p_created=1154461969&p |title=Official iRobot Website |publisher=Homesupport.irobot.com |date= |access-date=2009-06-09}}</ref> It also introduced customizable decorative face plates.<ref name=Aaron /> The Roomba 530 included two virtual walls and a recharging dock.<ref name=Aaron /> In August 2012, the 500 series was superseded by the 600 series, which added the aerovac bin and advanced cleaning head as standard features.

For instance, Roomba's sensors can detect the presence of obstacles, detect dirty spots on the floor, and sense steep drops to keep it from falling down stairs. Roomba uses two independently operating side wheels, that allow 360\u00b0 turns in place. A rotating, 3-pronged spinner [[brush]] can sweep debris from square corners to the cleaning head.\n\nThe Roomba units have a range of model sizes with the 400 to 900 series, which provide several different features, such as tangle-free brushes, separate sweep [[Cylindrical|canister]], a more powerful vacuum, obstacle avoidance, or [[performance map]]s displayed via a [[smartphone app]]. However, some parts of the Roomba models are interchangeable between related models, allowing a mix/match of features, or switching into other units for longer battery operation. The 900 series Roombas also feature a camera, which works in conjunction with onboard mapping, [[indoor positioning system]] and navigation software, to systematically cover all floor area, move from room to room and find recharging bases and beacons. \n\nAdditionally, some Roomba units can adapt to perform other, more creative tasks, using an embedded computer in conjunction with the Roomba Open Interface.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Roomba parts.jpg|thumb|right|Various Roomba internal parts]]\n[[File:RoombaRecharging.jpg|thumb|Roomba recharging.]]\nMost Roomba models are disc-shaped, 34&nbsp;cm (13\") in diameter and less than 9&nbsp;cm (3.5\") high. A large contact-sensing mechanical bumper is mounted on the front half of the unit, with an omnidirectional [[infrared]] sensor at its top front center. A recessed carrying handle is fitted on the top of most units.<ref name=\"Roomba 560 Video Review\">{{cite web |title= iRobot Roomba 560 Video Review |url= http://www.robotreviews.com/reviews/roomba-560-video-review |publisher= Robot Reviews |access-date= 18 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2016, there have been seven generations of Roomba units: The first-generation Original Series, the second-generation 400 and Discovery Series, the third-generation Professional and 500 Series, the fourth-generation 600 Series, the fifth-generation 700 Series, the sixth-generation 800 Series, and the seventh-generation 980 model.<ref name=\"iRobot Store\">{{cite web|title=iRobot Store|url=http://store.irobot.com/shop/index.jsp?categoryId=2174944|publisher=iRobot|access-date=30 May 2015}}</ref> All models have a pair of brushes, rotating in opposite directions, to pick up debris from the floor. In most models, the brushes are followed by a [[squeegee]] vacuum, which directs the airflow through a narrow slit to increase its speed in order to collect fine dust. A horizontally mounted \"side spinner\" brush on the right side of the unit sweeps against walls to reach debris not accessible by the main brushes and vacuum. In the first generation of robots, the dirty air passes through the fan before reaching the filter, while later models use a fan-bypass vacuum.\n\nThe Roomba is powered by a removable [[Nickel\u2013metal hydride battery|NiMH battery]], which must be recharged from a wall power adapter. Newer second- and third-generation models have a self-charging homebase that the unit seeks out at the end of a cleaning session via infrared beacons. Charging on the homebase takes about three hours. Four infrared \"cliff sensors\" on the bottom of the Roomba prevent it from falling off ledges such as stairways or entering black carpet areas. Most second- and third-generation models have internal acoustic-based dirt sensors that allow them to detect particularly dirty spots and focus on those areas accordingly. Fourth-generation models have an optical sensor located in front of the vacuum bin, allowing detection of wider and smaller messes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uksupport.irobot.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1048/related/1/?cc=uk |title=What is Roomba's Dirt Detect technology? |publisher=Uksupport.irobot.com |date= |access-date=2013-01-29}}</ref> Many second- and third-generation Roombas come packaged with infrared remote controls, allowing a human operator to \"drive\" the robot to areas to be specially cleaned.\n\nSome higher-end 500, 700 and 800 series robots are compatible with Virtual Wall Lighthouses,<ref name=Aaron>[http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2007/tc20070821_419619.htm?technology+product+review]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915171122/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2007/tc20070821_419619.htm?technology+product+review |date=September 15, 2011 }}</ref> which use radio signals to communicate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://homesupport.irobot.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/7283/~/overview-of-the-virtual-wall%C2%AE%C2%A0lighthouse%E2%84%A2.|title=Find Answers {{!}} iRobot Customer Care|website=homesupport.irobot.com|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> These more advanced accessories confine a Roomba to a fixed area to be cleaned, yet allow the robot to later proceed to the next space which needs to be cleaned.<ref name=Lighthouse>{{cite web|title=What are Roomba Virtual Walls?|url=http://homesupport.irobot.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/486|work=iRobot Customer Care|publisher=iRobot|access-date=2012-03-04}}</ref>\n\nThere are several types of dust and debris collection bins for the 500 series robots. The standard vacuum bin incorporates a squeegee vacuum.  The high-capacity sweeper bin does not include a vacuum, but has greater debris capacity. The Aerovac Bin directs suction airflow through the main brushes instead of using a squeegee, which is thought to keep the brushes cleaner.\n\n== Operation ==\n[[File:Roomba time-lapse.jpg|thumb|Long exposure photo showing path taken by a Roomba as it cleans]]\nAll Roomba models can be operated by manually carrying them to the room to be cleaned and pressing a button. Later models introduced several additional operating modes. \"Clean\" mode is the normal cleaning program, starting in a spiral and then following a wall, until the room is determined to be clean. \"Spot\" mode cleans a small area using an outward-then-inward spiral. \"Max\" mode runs the standard cleaning algorithm until the battery is depleted. \"Dock\" mode, introduced with the third generation, instructs the robot to seek a charging base for recharging. The availability of the modes varies by model.\n\nThe robot's bumper allows it to sense when it has bumped into an obstacle, after which it will reverse or change paths. The third- and fourth-generations, which move faster than previous models, have additional forward-looking infrared sensors to detect obstacles. These slow down the robot when nearing obstacles, to reduce its force of impact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homesupport.irobot.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/960/~/roomba%E2%AE-500%2F600%2F700-series-light-touch-technology |title=iRobot: Customer Care - Roomba 500/600/700 Series Light Touch Technology |publisher=Homesupport.irobot.com |date= |access-date=2013-01-29}}</ref> This technology is also able to distinguish between hard and soft obstacles. After enough time cleaning or as the battery runs down, the Roomba will either search for and dock with the base, or stop where it is.\n\nThe cleaning time depends on room size and, for models equipped with dirt sensors, volume of dirt. First-generation models must be told the room size, while second- and third-generation models estimate room size by measuring the longest straight-line run they can perform without bumping into an object. When finished cleaning, or when the battery is nearly depleted, a second- or third-generation Roomba will try to return to a base if one is detected. A second-generation Roomba may also be used with a scheduler accessory, allowing cleaning to start at the time of day and on days of the week that the owner desires. Most 500 Series robots support scheduling through buttons on the unit itself, and higher-end models allow the use of a remote to program schedules.\n\nEarly generation Roombas do not map out the rooms they are cleaning. Instead, iRobot developed a technology called iAdapt Responsive Cleaning Technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irobot.com/EngineeringAwesome/images/iAdapt+Fast+Facts.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=11 May 2013|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511232754/http://www.irobot.com/EngineeringAwesome/images/iAdapt%20Fast%20Facts.pdf|archivedate=11 May 2013}}</ref> Roombas rely on a few simple algorithms, such as spiral cleaning (spiraling), room crossing, wall-following and [[random walk]] angle-changing after bumping into an object or wall. This design is based on MIT researcher and iRobot CTO [[Rodney Brooks]]' philosophy that robots should be like insects, equipped with simple control mechanisms tuned to their environments. The result is that although Roombas are effective at cleaning rooms, they take several times longer to do the job than a human would. The Roomba may cover some areas many times, and other areas only once or twice. The virtual wall accessories project beams, which the Roomba will not cross.\n\nThe Roomba is not designed for deep-pile carpet.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Also, the first- and second-generation Roombas can get stuck on rug tassels and electrical cords.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} The third-generation is able to reverse its brushes to escape entangled cords and tassels. Additionally, all models are designed to be low enough to go under a bed or most other items of furniture. If at any time the unit senses that it has become stuck, no longer senses the floor beneath it, or it decides that it has worked its way into a narrow area from which it is unable to escape, it stops and sounds an error to help someone find it.  Early models use only flashing lights to indicate specific problems, while later models use a [[Speech synthesis|synthesized voice]] to announce a problem and a suggested solution.<ref name=Stuck>{{cite web|title=How can I prevent Roomba from getting stuck?|url=http://homesupport.irobot.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/62/p/788|work=iRobot Customer Care|publisher=iRobot|access-date=2012-03-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Battery life ===\nBattery reliability is a frequently mentioned complaint on customer review websites.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Battery replacements from iRobot cost a significant fraction of the purchase price of a new Roomba, though compatible third-party batteries are available at a lower price.

The first-generation units comprised the original silver-colored Roomba, the blue Roomba Pro, and the maroon Roomba Pro Elite. The later two models included additional accessories, but all three used the same core robot and cleaning system. The second-generation Roombas (\"Discovery\", later called 400 series) replaced their predecessors in July 2004, added a larger dust bin, improved software that calculates room size, dirt detection, and fast charging in the home base.\n\nRoomba budget models (Dirt Dog and Model 401) used a simplified interface (a single button) and lacked some of the software-controlled flexibility of other versions. They were less expensive models intended for first-time purchasers. The Roomba Dirt Dog contained sweeping brushes and a larger dust bin, but lacked the vacuum motor, using the space that would be required for the vacuum for additional dust bin volume. It was designed for a home shop or garage environment.<ref name=Aaron /> The Roomba Model 401 was similar but had a standard-size dust bin and vacuum system. The Dirt Dog was discontinued in 2010.\n\n=== 500 and 600 series ===\nThe third-generation 500 series Roomba was introduced in August 2007<ref name=Aaron /> and featured a forward-looking infrared sensor to detect obstacles and reduce speed, a docking command button, improved mechanical components, smoother operation, and a modular design to facilitate part replacement.<ref name=Aaron /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://homesupport.irobot.com/cgi-bin/irobot_homesupport.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=136&p_created=1154461969&p |title=Official iRobot Website |publisher=Homesupport.irobot.com |date= |access-date=2009-06-09}}</ref> It also introduced customizable decorative face plates.<ref name=Aaron /> The Roomba 530 included two virtual walls and a recharging dock.<ref name=Aaron /> In August 2012, the 500 series was superseded by the 600 series, which added the aerovac bin and advanced cleaning head as standard features.

Like the 500 series, the 700 series included robots with different technologies and accessories. The Roomba 760 was the simplest of the robots, and Roomba 790<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irobot.com/us/Roomba_790.aspx |title=iRobot Corporation: Roomba 790 |publisher=Irobot.com |access-date=1 July 2012}}</ref> was the second newest, with both scheduling and a large range of accessories including lighthouses, wireless command center, and extra brushes and filters. Besides these two models, Roomba 770 and 780 were available, with scheduling, dirtdetect, and full bin indicator.\n\n=== 800 series ===\nThe 800 series, introduced in 2013, is similar to the 700 series and its predecessors, but contains updated technology. The aeroforce performance cleaning system, which is five times more powerful than older series,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sevenhints.com/bobsweep-vs-roomba-vs-neato/|title=Bobsweep vs Roomba vs Neato \u2013 Robotic Vacuum Cleaners Battle! \u2014 Sevenhints|last=|first=|date=2017-03-14|work=Sevenhints|access-date=|language=en-US}}</ref> and the iRobot XLife battery are some of the new features. The aeroforce system does away with the large rotating brush, but pulls air between two rubber rollers, thereby getting the vacuum suction closer to the floor.

The self emptying base uses a disposable bag.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/vacuum-cleaner-reviews/irobot-roomba-i7-plus-review/|title=iRobot Roomba i7+ review|website=www.digitaltrends.com|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref> The basic e5 Roomba replaces the 800 series and the 890 model with an improved battery life from 60 to 90 minutes of run time on hardwood floors using a lithium ion battery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allhomerobotics.com/roomba-e5-review-worth-the-price-or-waste-of-money/|title=Roomba e5 details}}</ref>\n\n=== S series ===\nIn late May 2019, iRobot introduced the Roomba s9 and s9+ as the \"smartest, most powerful robot vacuum yet\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irobot.com/roomba/s-series|title=Roomba s Series {{!}} iRobot|website=www.irobot.com|language=en|access-date=2019-06-10}}</ref> The S series Roomba features a newly designed \"D\" shape and corner brush for optimized edge cleaning deep into corners and along edges. Other new features include an anti-allergen system that traps 99% of pollen, mold and allergens, 40X suction compared to 600 series, 30% wider rubber brushes, and the most advanced navigation system to date. Similar to the I series, the S series has the option for a Clean Base with automatic dirt disposal which allows the Roomba to empty itself into a disposable bag when it returns to the base for charging. The S series also includes link technology that brings the next generation of home automation where the Braava Jet M6 can automatically be set to mop after the s9 has finished vacuuming. The difference between the s9 and s9+ is that the s9+ comes with Automatic Dirt Disposal like the i7 and i7+.\n\n== Hacking and extending Roomba ==\n{{See also|iRobot Create}}\n[[File:Roomba hack Spirograph.jpg|thumb|A hacked Roomba drawing a [[Spirograph]]-like pattern]]\nFrom the earliest models on, Roomba vacuum cleaning robots have been [[Hacker culture#Use outside of computing|hacked]] to extend their functionality.

In this model the vacuum cleaner motor is replaced by a \"cargo bay\" for mounting devices like TV cameras, lasers and other robotic parts.  It provides a greatly enhanced 25-pin interface providing both analog and digital bidirectional communication with the hosted device allowing use as the mobile base for completely new robots. Together with a computing platform like a netbook or handheld device with wireless networking, it can be remotely controlled through a network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irobot.com/hrd_right_rail/create_rr/create_fam/createFam_rr_projects.html |title=Roomba Robot project |publisher=Irobot.com |date= |access-date=2012-03-04}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Comparison of domestic robots]]\n* [[Domestic robot]]\n* [[Robotic vacuum cleaner]]\n* [[List of vacuum cleaners]]\n* [[Indoor positioning system]]\n* [[Robotic mapping]]\n* [[Robotics suite]]\n* [[Scooba (brand)|Scooba]] floor washer, iRobot's second home robot\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://irobot.com/ iRobot.com], manufacturer and retailer of Roomba in the United States\n{{IRobot}}\n\n[[Category:2002 robots]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 2002]]\n[[Category:Home appliance brands]]\n[[Category:IRobot]]\n[[Category:Robotic vacuum cleaners]]\n", "name_user": "2001:48f8:4028:8a3:152d:9ec6:cee2:974f", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200e500 and 600 series)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roomba"}
