{"title_page": "Gda\u0144sk crisis (1932)", "text_new": "The Gda\u0144sk crisis of 1932 was an incident between the [[Free City of Danzig]] (modern [[Gda\u0144sk]], Poland) and Poland concerning what the Polish government had the right to station warships in Danzig harbour together with Poland's claim to represent Danzig with foreign powers. The incident was sparked on 14 June 1932 when a squadron of British destroyers visited Danzig and was greeted by the Polish destroyer ''Wicher\u00a0'' which had entered Danzig harbour without the permission of the Senate of the Free City. The incident to the Danzig authorities reluctantly ceding the right of Poland to station its warships in Danzig, the renewal of the agreement governing Polish rights in the Free City and within Poland a shift towards navalism. \n==Background==\nThe American president [[Woodrow Wilson]] had issued a set of war aims known as the [[14 Points]] in January 1918. Point 13 called for the Polish independence to be restored after the war and for Poland to have \"secure access to the sea\", a statement that implied the German deep-water port of Danzig located at a strategical location where a branch of the river Vistula flowed into the Baltic Sea should become part of Poland. At the Paris peace conference in 1919, of the \"Big Three\" leaders, Wilson and the French premier [[Georges Cl\u00e9menceau]] supported the Polish claim to Danzig, but the British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] was opposed under the grounds the population of Danzig was about 90% German. In a compromise, it was agreed that Danzig would become a Free City that would belong to neither Germany nor Poland, but the latter was to have  special rights in the city. Agreements such as the Paris convention of 1920 gave Poland certain rights with regards to the foreign relations of the Free City.{{sfn|Graczyk|2007|p=78-79}} \n\nOn the part of the Baltic coast that did become part of Poland, there were only two small fishing ports, [[Puck, Poland|Puck]] and [[Hel, Poland|Hel]], neither of which were suitable as naval bases. The most suitable port was Danzig, which was largely demilitarised under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The League of Nations, which possessed ultimate legal authority over Danzig suggested Poland use Danzig as a ''port d'attache'', where Poland would have the right to station warships, but not build any naval base to support the warships. On 8 October 1921, an agreement was signed giving Poland \u00a0''port d'attache'' rights in Danzig to be renewed every three years. Polish warships wintered in Danzig when the Baltic froze over and employed the shipwrights of the Free City to do repairs and maintenance work.{{sfn|Kondracki|2013|p=14-15}} The Polish Navy was very small in the 1920s, consisting mostly of former German torpedo boats.{{sfn|Zawadzki|1998|p=11}} \n\nIn March 1931, the Senate of the Free City unilaterally terminated Poland's ''port d'attache'' rights.{{sfn|Kondracki|2013|p=14-15}} The dispute was referred to the Council of the League of Nations, which in a ruling on 19 September 1931 decreed that both parties should take their to the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague. On December 11, 1931 the Permanent Court of International Justice ruled that the existing contracts did not constitute grounds for stationing Polish warships in Danzig. The court suggested that the two sides settle the dispute themselves. On 1 May 1932, the Senate ruled that Polish Navy's warships could enter Danzig if permission was first obtained from the Senate. The Free City had invited a group of Royal Navy destroyers to visit Danzig in June 1932, bringing tensions to the boil.{{sfn|Piaskowski|1984|p=7-10}}\n\n==The Incident==\nMarshal [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], Poland's de facto leader, decided at the suggestion of the Deputy Polish Foreign Minister, Colonel [[J\u00f3zef Beck]], to use the up-coming visit of the British warships as a trial of strength. At a meeting with the commander of the Polish Navy, Admiral [[J\u00f3zef Unrug]] and the captain of the destroyer [[ORP Wicher (1928)|ORP ''Wicher'']] Lieutenant Commander Tadeusz Morgenstern-Podjazd, it was decided that the \u00a0''Wicher'' would serve as the host to the British squadron regardless if the Free City granted permission or not. Morgenstern-Podjazd was ordered to open fire in the even of difficulties, and in the event of any disrespect to the Polish flag to open fire on buildings belonging to the Free City.{{sfn|Kondracki|2013|p=14-15}}{{sfn|Piaskowski|1984|p=7-10}}{{sfn|Koszela|2013|p=25}} \n\nOn 14 June 1932, the ''Wicher'' arrived at the Danzig roads. Later the same day, the British squadron consisting of the destroyers' HMS ''Campbell'', HMS ''Westminster'', HMS ''Walpole'' and HMS ''Vidette'' under command of Commander [[Henry Pridham-Wippell]] arrived in the evening. Owning to a tight time schedule making impossible the planned courtesy mutual visits, Morgenstern-Podjazd decided to welcome the British in Danzig harbour. The Polish commissioner to Danzig, [[Kazimierz Pap\u00e9e]], informed the Senate that the ''Wicher'' would be entering Danzig harbour regardless about their feelings about the matter. On 15 June 1932 at about 9:30 am, the ''Wicher'' and the Royal Navy squadron entered Danzig harbour over the protests of the Senate. The ''Wicher'' was anchored at a quay in Danzig until the afternoon. Morgenstern-Podjazd paid a visit to  Pridham-Wippell aboard the ''Campbell'' and Pridham-Wippell in turn visited the ''Wicher''. Both the ''Wicher'' and the British ships left Danzig at the sametime. As the Polish flag was not disrespected, Morgenstern-Podjazd did not need to fire a shot in anger.{{sfn|Kondracki|2013|p=14-15}} \n==Aftermath==\nThe demonstration of Polish strength had its effect and on 13 August 1932, a new agreement was signed allowing the Polish Navy to use Danzig harbour.{{sfn|Kondracki|2013|p=14-15}}{{sfn|Zawadzki|1998|p=12}} The new agreement dropped the term ''port d'attache'' and gave the Polish Navy greater refueling and maintenance rights, through the unfriendly attitude of the Free City together with the Treaty of Versailles ruled out the possibility of a permanent naval base. The 1932 incident was  the first and so only case of what Poland engaging in what might be called [[gunboat diplomacy]] with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs using the Navy to achieve diplomatic objectives. The incident also influenced Polish attitudes towards the Navy. Marshal Pi\u0142sudski had long been skeptical of the value of the Navy, which tended to be underfunded. The incident led to a navalist turn in Poland and Pi\u0142sudski increased the naval budget, by ordering six-year expansion plan for the Navy consisting of two [[Grom-class destroyer|''Grom-''class destroyers]] and two [[Orze\u0142-class submarine|''Orze\u0142''-class submarines]].\n\n==Sources==\n*Graczyk, Marcin A''dmira\u0142 \u015awirsk''i .

The tectonic processes on the high Atlas proabaly lead to most of the Volcanic manifestations locally.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\nThe formation is subdivided on several stratigraphic levels, starting with the so called  facies of term A, composed by  [[Gypsum]] and [[Salt]], from Triassic age, supported by the presence of Volcanic Intercalations of basalt.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Above that, there are carbonates of term B alternated at the first with [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]]s, [[Pelite]]s and [[Limestone]]s along with Marly-[[Silt]] crimes with plant debris, which had regular influence  of a marine environment.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> That is proved by the presence of [[Ooid]]s, [[Oncolith]]s, debris of [[Mollusc]]s and benthic [[Foraminifer]]s, being dissolved and recrystallized as [[Sparite]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The third level shows a transition between marine and continental deposits, through carbonate palustrine levels and [[Caliche]] horizons, being continental layers superimposed in stratigraphic continuity over the marine carbonates of the lower Lias ([[Sinemurian]]-[[Hettangian]]).<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Those continental layers are rich in [[Coarse structure|Coarse]] Volcano-detrital episodes as result of a sedimentary  process of  high sedimentation rates, where the strata,  including the deposit with Dinosaur fossils, where deposited on a short time interval, where Middle Jurassic [[Bajocian]]-[[Bathonian]] carbonate levels, frequent within the Atlas domain, do not exist not in Toundoute.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The sedimentation on the Toundoute member have some characteristics, such as  lenticular channels with [[Sieve]]-[[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]] of ~5 m thick (\u2264 5m) for visible decametric, composed of several materials, like  Volcanic products, as  blocks of volcanic rocks such as sands made of [[Feldspar]]s, black ferruginous grains from the surface of volcanic rocks on dry periods, siliceous green fragments from post eruption processes  ([[Vein (geology)|Vein]]s, [[Microgeode]]s, [[Nippled Concretions]]), [[Limestone]] debris with traces of roots and cracks, where in some parts traces dark fine bushy algae filaments are still visible, similar to te genus [[Girvanella]] blue-green algae.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> Other materials include [[Schist]] and Vein [[Quartz]], witouth bone and wood debris with a good cellular structure.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 /> The [[Floodplain]]-like deposits are divided in two parts, with hard [[Limestone]] nodules, pink or brick and very irregular, typical of profiles of [[Calcimorph Soils]] formed on climates with pronounced dry phases. Those nodules had a visible reorganization in the channels, as a result of erosion of the alluvial plain by the fluvial network.<ref name=\"Montenat\"/><ref name=Allain0 /> Finally there are present interlays of fine sandstone often laminated that mark the [[Flood]] facies from channels in period of flood, being composed only by plagioclase [[Feldspar]]s and in a lesser proportion of [[Orthoclase]]s, along  with small ferruginous grains or fine silts of [[Quartz]].<ref name=Allain2 /><ref name=Allain3 />\nThere is documentation of warm climatic conditions locally, that alternating wet and dry periods, as is seen on the other formations gave rise to soils with differentiated limestone profiles, such as [[Pedogenetic Nodules]] or [[Caliche]].<ref name=\"Montenat\"/> The accumulation in the channels from calcimorphic soil profiles shows the presence of an active erosion on soils with probably sparse vegetation.<ref name=\"Ettaki, M. 2000\"/><ref name=Allain0 /><ref name=Allain1 /> \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stratigraphy of the Toundoute Continental Series\n!Unit \n!Lithology\n!Thickness (metres)\n!Dinosaur fossils\n|-\n|[[Alluvium]]\n|Holocene conglomerate\n|\n|\n|-\n|H\n|Clay-sandstone series\n|\u2265 100 \n|\n|-\n|G\n|Clay-sandstone series, with gypsum layer present at the top, just below this a second dinosaur bearing horizon is present with very similar lithology to unit F.\n|50 \n|''[[Tazoudasaurus]], [[Berberosaurus]]''<ref name=\"Taquet4\"/>\n|-\n|F\n|Greenish grey clay-marl, detrital gravel to pebble sized clasts with lignite and bones.\n|\u2264 5 \n|Present, indeterminate\n|-\n|E\n|Alternation of red brown clay, fine sandstone and sandstone coarse conglomerates\n|100 \n|\n|-\n|D\n|Clay, fine sandstone and conglomerate, large volcanic rocks present.<ref>Ellero, A., Ottria, G., Malus\u00e0, M.

It is characterised by the presence of abundant Cuartz sediments, along with the pesence of Red Clays. The facies of the formation follow a deposition typical of Alluvial Plains.<ref name=Jenny1 /><ref name=Ibouh1 /> It also recovers a succession of reddish brown tones predominantly terrigenous: [[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]]s, [[Sandstone]], clays related to  [[Paleosoils]], along with dolomitized [[Limestone]]. The Wazzant formation has a notorious proximal character compared to the Azilal formation.  These deposits fill in many small tear pools in the Atlas Central.<ref>Laville, E. (1978).

The predominantly terrigenous deposits of this formation suggest they were  deposited in continental setting, influenced by at least 6 different river channels, that trace it's path to the Atlas Gulf. On the [[Toarcian]]-[[Aalenian]] transgression, the High Atlas domain experienced a long process of extension and rifting, recorded by the presence of marine carbonates and shales, found on the Wazzant Formation Beds. It is related to the formation of the [[Atlantic Rifting]] to the west and of the formation of the [[Tethys]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} to the north.<ref>El Harfi, A., Guiraud, M., & Lang, J. (2006).

Shawn Smith, Dan Hsu, and Crispin Boyer applauded its traditional side-scrolling gameplay, huge levels, graphics, and animation, especially on the bosses. Sushi-X, in contrast, said that the levels are surprisingly small, making it a disappointment compared to the first game.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Vectorman 2|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 1996 |page=90}}</ref> Scary Larry gave it a 4.5/5 in graphics and a 5/5 in every other category.

In 1975 he also took on the editorship of ''[[The China Quarterly]]'', continuing until 1980.\nWilson had suffered a serious illness during his early travelling years and in later life this led to his posture becoming more and more stooped.  However he continued writing well into the 2000s, turning his attention mostly to the Indian subcontinent, but this work appears to remain unpublished.  He died in hospital in January 2011.

With his wife Sally he moved into a detached Georgian house in Grove Lane, Camberwell and they adopted two children, Emma and Ben.  The first of his many books on China, ''A Quarter of Mankind'', was published in 1966. In 1975 he also took on the editorship of ''[[The China Quarterly]]'', continuing until 1980.\nWilson had suffered a serious illness during his early travelling years and in later life this led to his posture becoming more and more stooped.  However he continued writing well into the 2000s, turning his attention mostly to the Indian subcontinent, but this work appears to remain unpublished.  He died in hospital in January 2011.  His wife Sally was also in hospital at the time (she too died a few months later) and his death passed unnoticed by the media.\n\n==Publications==\n\n*A Quarter of Mankind (1966)\n*Asia Awakes (1970)\n*The Long March 1935: the epic of Chinese Communism's survival (1971)\n*East Meets west \u2013 Singapore (1971)\n*The Future Role of Singapore (1972)\n*The Neutralization of South East Asia (1975)\n*Mao Tse-tung in the Scales of History (editor) (1977)\n*Mao, The People's Emperor (1979)\n*When Tigers Fight, The Sino-Japanese War 1937\u201345 (1982)\n*Chou, The Story of Zhou Enlai 1898\u20131976 (1984)\n*Another Bite at the Cherry, The European View of Japan\n*The Sun at Noon, An Anatomy of Modern Japan (1986)\n*A Bank for Half the World.
