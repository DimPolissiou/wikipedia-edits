She served in the [[Second World War]] and survived it, being one of only two of the K-class to do so.  So far she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name ''Kimberley'', after the town of [[Kimberley, Northern Cape]], site of the [[Siege of Kimberley]] in the [[Second Boer War]].  She was adopted by the civil community of [[Eastwood, Nottinghamshire|Eastwood]], [[Kimberley, Nottinghamshire|Kimberley]] and [[Selston]], [[Nottinghamshire]] in 1942 after a successful [[Warship Week]] campaign for National Savings.\n\n==Construction and commissioning==\n''Kimberley'' was ordered from the yards of [[John I. Thornycroft & Company]], [[Woolston, Hampshire]] under the 1937 Programme.  She was laid down on 17 January 1938 as Yard No 1179.  She was launched on 1 June 1939 and commissioned on 21 December, though final works were not completed until early the following year.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Norway and the North Sea===\n''Kimberley'' spent January 1940 carrying out contractors' trials.  She finished the trials and had completed storing and weapon system calibrations by February, and took passage to [[Scapa Flow]] to join the units of the [[Home Fleet]].  On 21 February she was deployed with the [[cruiser]] [[HMS Manchester (15)|HMS ''Manchester'']] in the [[Western Approaches|North Western Approaches]], carrying out patrols to intercept merchant shipping returning to [[Germany]] and [[commerce raiders]] attempting to attack [[Battle of the Atlantic|Atlantic convoys]].  During this patrol, the two ships captured the German freighter {{SS|Wahehe|1922|2}}.  ''Kimberley'' provided a boarding party and the ship was taken into [[Kirkwall]] as a prize.\n\nShe remained with the Home Fleet carrying out patrol duties throughout March.  On 7 April she formed part of a screen for the [[battleship]]s [[HMS Rodney (29)|HMS ''Rodney'']] and {{HMS|Valiant|1914|6}}, the [[battlecruiser]] [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']] and the cruisers of the Home Fleet during a search in the North Western Approaches for German ships that had been reported on passage into the Atlantic.  Actually, these ships were part of [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the German invasion of [[Norway]].  On 8 April, after the invasion, ''Kimberley'' remained as part of the screen for allied ships preparing to land in Norway as part of [[Operation Wilfred]].  She was detached with [[HMS Bedouin (F67)|HMS ''Bedouin'']], [[HMS Eskimo (F75)|HMS ''Eskimo'']] and [[HMS Punjabi (F21)|HMS ''Punjabi'']] later in the day to go to the assistance of [[HMS Glowworm (H92)|HMS ''Glowworm'']], which was under attack by the [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|German cruiser ''Admiral Hipper'']].  Before the British destroyers could come to the relief, the ''Glowworm'' was sunk with heavy loss of life.\n\n''Kimberley'' was dispatched with HMS ''Eskimo'' and {{HMS|Penelope|97|6}} on 11 April to attack German transports that had been reported at [[Bod\u00f8]].  ''Penelope'' ran aground whilst attempting to enter the fjord at [[Fleinv\u00e6r]], and had to be towed clear by ''Eskimo''.  They then successfully entered the fjord but did not find any ships.  They returned to support fleet operations off [[Narvik]].  ''Kimberley'' then took part in the [[Battles of Narvik#Second Naval Battle of Narvik|Second Battle of Narvik]], during which she attempted to tow [[HMS Cossack (F03)|HMS ''Cossack'']] to safety, after ''Cossack'' had been damaged by German destroyers and disabled.  The attempt failed, but ''Cossack'' was later towed clear by [[HMS Forester (H74)|HMS ''Forester'']].  ''Kimberley'' was left on patrol at Narvik. Several crew members were killed when a boarding party was sent into Narvik to disable a German seaplane. ''Kimberley'' then returned to Scapa Flow.\n\n===Arrival in the Mediterranean===\nShe was nominated to serve in the Mediterranean in May, and underwent preparation for foreign service that saw the damage sustained during the Norwegian operations being repaired.  Her pennant number was also changed, to G50.  She left Britain on 16 May, in company with her sisters, [[HMS Kandahar (F28)|HMS ''Kandahar'']] and [[HMS Khartoum (F45)|HMS ''Khartoum'']].  They arrived at [[Alexandria]] on 23 April, and all three were nominated for service in the [[Red Sea]], in company with another sister, [[HMS Kingston (F64)|HMS ''Kingston'']].  These actions were part of a series of precautions that were being taken in anticipation of [[Italy]]'s entry to the war on the side of the [[Axis powers]].  Italy had a number of destroyers and [[submarine]]s based in [[Eritrea]], which could threaten British shipping.\n\n''Kimberley'' and her sisters were deployed on convoy defence duties throughout June and July, but in August ''Kimberley'' was nominated to support the evacuation of British nationals from [[Berbera]], in [[British Somaliland]].  She and HMS ''Khandahar'' joined the a taskforce consisting of the cruisers [[HMS Caledon (D53)|HMS ''Caledon'']], [[HMAS Hobart (1939)|HMAS ''Hobart'']], {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}} and [[HMS Carlisle (D67)|HMS ''Carlisle'']], the [[sloop-of-war|sloops]] [[HMAS Parramatta (U44)|HMAS ''Parramatta'']], [[HMS Shoreham (L32)|HMS ''Shoreham'']] and [[HMS Auckland (L61)|HMS ''Auckland'']], the armed boarding vessels ''Chakala'', ''Chakdina'' and ''Laomedon'', and the [[hospital ship]] ''Vita''.  On 16 August they assisted in the evacuation of over 7,000 people from British Somalia, embarking them for passage to [[Colony of Aden|Aden]].\n\n===Convoys through the Red Sea===\nOn 12 September ''Kimberley'' joined the military convoy WS-2A as it passed through the Red Sea as an escort, in company with [[HMS Shropshire (73)|HMS ''Shropshire'']], {{HMS|Auckland|L61|6}} and [[HMS Flamingo (L18)|HMS ''Flamingo'']]. She was detached on 14 September. On 20 October she joined [[HMNZS Leander|HMS ''Leander'']] and five sloops of the East Indies Squadron in escorting [[Attack on Convoy BN 7|Convoy BN 7]]. They [[Attack on Convoy BN 7|came under attack]] the following day by four Italian destroyers some 150 miles east of [[Massawa]]. ''Kimberley'' engaged the [[Sauro class destroyer|''Sauro'' class]] [[destroyer]] {{ship|Italian destroyer|Francesco Nullo|1925|2}} and drove her ashore on [[Harmil]] Island. ''Kimberley'' then fired a torpedo at the enemy, but came under fire from shore batteries. She took a hit in her engine room, which disabled her. She was taken in tow by HMS ''Leander'' and brought into [[Port Sudan]]. ''Nullo'' was destroyed the following day by [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Blenheim bomber]]s. ''Kimberley'' was under repair on 27 October, but was back in action on 31 October, when she resumed convoy defence duties. The damage meant that she was operating at reduced speed.\n\n''Kimberley'' and HMS ''Caledon'' escorted the troopships [[SS Duchess of York|SS ''Duchess of York'']] and [[SS Georgic|SS ''Georgic'']] from Aden to the military convoy WS-3 in the Red Sea on 12 November. She was detached on 14 November and returned to Aden. She continued to escort military convoys throughout December, this time in company with HMS ''Carlisle'' and HMS ''Kandahar''. ''Kimberley'' took passage to [[Bombay]] in January 1941 to complete repairs, which lasted throughout February.  She rejoined the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]] at Alexandria in March and began deployments with them in April. On 16 April she was part of the screen for the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Formidable|67|6}}, together with the destroyers [[HMS Griffin (H31)|HMS ''Griffin'']], [[HMS Defender (H07)|HMS ''Defender'']] and HMS ''Kingston'' during her passage to [[Suda Bay]] with other fleet units prior to the planned bombardment of [[Tripoli]]. ''Kimberley'' remained offshore with ''Formidable'' during the bombardment on 21 April. The following day she deployed with the fleet screen during the return to Alexandria after the end of the bombardment, arriving on 23 April.\n\n===Covering the Mediterranean convoys===\nShe was quickly deployed again on 26 April, as an escort for [[Convoy AG-15]] to [[Piraeus]], along with [[HMAS Vampire (D68)|HMAS ''Vampire'']] and HMS ''Auckland''.  She was then engaged in the [[Battle of Greece#Evacuation of Commonwealth forces|evacuation of allied troops from Greece]], taking troops off from Raphti on 27 April, and [[Kalamata]] on 29 April.  She left Kalmata for the final time on 1 May.  ''Kimberley'' deployed again on 6 May, with HMS ''Griffin'', [[HMS Havock (H43)|HMS ''Havock'']], [[HMS Hereward (H93)|HMS ''Hereward'']], [[HMS Hero (H99)|HMS ''Hero'']], [[HMS Hotspur (H01)|HMS ''Hotspur'']], [[HMS Jervis (F00)|HMS ''Jervis'']], [[HMS Juno (F46)|HMS ''Juno'']], HMS ''Kandahar'', HMS ''Kingston'' [[HMAS Nizam (G38)|HMS ''Nizam'']] and [[HMS Nubian (F36)|HMS ''Nubian'']], as a screen for HMS ''Formidable'', the battleships [[HMS Barham (04)|HMS ''Barham'']], HMS ''Valiant'' and [[HMS Warspite (03)|HMS ''Warspite'']], the cruisers [[HMS Orion (85)|HMS ''Orion'']], [[HMAS Perth (D29)|HMAS ''Perth'']] and [[HMS Abdiel (M39)|HMS ''Abdiel'']] as they provided cover for convoys in the eastern Mediterranean.  These [[Malta Convoys|convoys]] were a convoy from [[Egypt]] to [[Malta]], and a military convoy from Malta to Alexandria with tanks for the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]. ''Kimberley'' remained deployed with the fleet screen until it arrived at Alexandria on 10 May, having been the target of unsuccessful air attacks.\n\nShe deployed again on 15 May screening fleet units covering convoys to reinforce [[Crete]].  She deployed with [[HMS Janus (F53)|HMS ''Janus'']], [[HMS Hasty (H24)|HMS ''Hasty'']] and HMS ''Hereward'' as a screen for the cruisers [[HMS Dido (37)|HMS ''Dido'']], HMS ''Orion'' and {{HMS|Ajax|22|6}}.  They formed Force D, and on 22 May they intercepted an invasion convoy north of Crete and sank several ships.  They took part in the bombardment of the airfield at [[Scarpanto]] on 23 May and the following day were deployed with [[HMS Decoy (H75)|HMS ''Decoy'']], HMS ''Hotspur'', HMS ''Hereward'', [[HMS Imperial (D09)|HMS ''Imperial'']] and [[HMS Jackal (F22)|HMS ''Jackal'']] as a screen for ''Dido'' and ''Ajax'' as they searched Kaso Strait for invasion craft.  ''Kimberley'' returned to Alexandria on 25 May, sailing again on 28 May with ''Ajax'', ''Orion'' and ''Dido'', screened by ''Hotspur'', ''Hereward'', ''Imperial'' and ''Jackal'' to begin evacuating troops from Crete.  The destroyers reached [[Heraklion]] on 29 May and began to ferry troops to the cruisers offshore.  The British ships came under heavy and sustained air attacks during their return passage, during which both ''Ajax'' and ''Dido'' were badly damaged.\n\n===Evacuating Crete===\n''Kimberley'' returned to Crete on 31 May and began evacuating troops from [[Sphakia]] on 1 June.  She returned to Alexandria on 2 June, and on 6 June was nominated to support military operations in [[Syria]], with HMS ''Kandahar'', ''Jackal'', ''Janus'' and the cruiser {{HMS|Phoebe|43|6}}.  They deployed off Syria on 7 June to intercept [[Vichy French]] destroyers that were attempting to provide support to defending French military units.  The British ships also provided naval gunfire support.  ''Kimberley'' took HMS ''Janus'' in tow on 9 June after ''Janus'' had been disabled in an engagement with several French destroyers.  She towed ''Janus'' to [[Haifa]], coming under attack from Vichy French aircraft as they made the passage.  ''Kimberley'' returned to action on 10 June, when she carried out a bombardment of the Khan bridge area in support of a British military advance.  On 15 June whilst off [[Beirut]], she was involved in an engagement with the French [[Gu\u00e9pard class destroyer|''Gu\u00e9pard'' class destroyers]] ''Guepard'' and ''Valmy''.  ''Kimberley'' remained off the Syrian coast into July, carrying further support bombardments on 4 July, before returning to Alexandria.\n\n===Convoys to Malta===\nOn 22 July she and the destroyers HMS ''Hasty'', ''Havock'', ''Jackal'', [[HMS Jaguar (F34)|''Jaguar'']], ''Jervis'', ''Kandahar'', ''Kingston'', ''Nizam'' and ''Nubian'' formed a screen for the battleships {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} and ''Valiant'', the cruisers HMS ''Ajax'', HMAS ''Hobart'', HMS ''Leander'', [[HMS Naiad (93)|''Naiad'']], [[HMS Neptune (20)|''Neptune'']], ''Phoebe'' and ''Abdiel'' as they carried out a diversionary operation in the eastern Mediterranean to divert attention away from [[Operation Substance]], a Malta relief convoy.  ''Kimberley'' was deployed in support of army operations against [[Tobruk]], and screening fleet units as they searched for enemy supply convoys throughout August to October 1941.\n\nShe was transferred in November to join the cruisers [[HMS Aurora (12)|HMS ''Aurora'']] and HMS ''Penelope'' as part of [[Force K]].  These ships were based at Malta, and were tasked with the job of intercepting enemy supply convoys bound for North Africa.  ''Kimberley'' took passage to Malta on 22 November with HMS ''Ajax'', ''Neptune'' and ''Kingston'' to reinforce Force K.  They were screened by the cruisers {{HMS|Euryalus|42|6}}, HMS ''Naiad'' and two destroyers as they made this transit.  ''Kimberley'' had her first deployment with the Force on 30 November, when she joined HMS ''Aurora'', ''Penelope'', ''Ajax'', ''Neptune'' and ''Kingston'' in intercepting a supply convoy.  ''Kimberley'' carried out an attack on the convoy off [[Benghazi]], on 1 December and succeeded in sinking the ammunition ship ''Adriatico''.  She was in action again the following day, when she took part in the sinking of the [[Italian destroyer Alvise Da Mosto|Italian destroyer ''Alvise Da Mosto'']] and the merchant ''Mantovani'' off Kerkenah Bank.\n\nShe next sailed from Malta on 5 December, with HMS ''Kingston'' and [[HMS Lively (G40)|''Lively'']], and the cruisers ''Ajax'' and ''Neptune''.  They formed the escort for the fast supply ship [[HMS Breconshire|HMS ''Breconshire'']], during her passage to meet the ships out of Alexandria.  ''Ajax'', ''Neptune'' and ''Lively'' were detached on 6 December and returned to Malta.  ''Kimberley'' remained with the ''Breconshire''.  They were joined on 7 December by HMAS ''Hobart'', but she was soon detached to go to the assistance of HMS ''Flamingo'', which had been damaged off Tobruk.  ''Kimberley'' and ''Kingston'' arrived at Alexandria with the ''Breconshire'' on 8 December.  On 15 December ''Kimberley'' joined the cruisers HMS ''Carlisle'', ''Euryalus'' and ''Naiad'' and the destroyers ''Hasty'', ''Havock'', ''Jervis'', ''Kingston'', [[HMS Kipling (F91)|''Kipling'']], ''Decoy'' and ''Nizam'' in forming Force C, which was assigned to escort the ''Breconshire'' to Malta.  By 16 December unconfirmed reports of Italian battle group escorting a supply convoy to Benghazi had reached the British force.  The force was sighted on 17 December, and the ''Breconshire'' was detached from Force C, escorted by ''Decoy'' and ''Havock''.  ''Kimberley'' remained with Force C.  A brief engagement followed, later becoming known as the [[First Battle of Sirte]], in which the Italian warships withdrew after the British destroyers attempted to approach to make torpedo attacks.  ''Kimberley'' returned to Alexandria on 18 December with the rest of the escorts.\n\n===Torpedoing===\n1942 saw her deployed in support of the Tobruk garrison, as well as continued to provide escort and defence for convoys.  On 12 January, whilst off Tobruk she was struck by a torpedo fired by [[German submarine U-77 (1940)|''U-77'']].  ''Kimberley'' sustained major damage to her stern, and had to be taken in tow by [[HMS Heythrop (L85)|HMS ''Heythrop'']] and was towed to Alexandria.  She spent February to December 1942, and all of 1943 under repair, first at Alexandria, then at Bombay.  After trials and work-up between January and March 1944, she was finally ready to return to service.  She returned to the Mediterranean in April and was put back on her usual patrol duties.  She was patrolling on 27 May with HMS ''Aurora'', when she and the [[Free French]] destroyers [[French destroyer Le Malin|''Le Malin'']], [[French destroyer Le Terrible|''Le Terrible'']] and [[French destroyer Le Fantasque|''Le Fantasque'']] were damaged in heavy weather and forced to return to Alexandria for repairs.  The repairs were completed by June and ''Kimberley'' moved to be based out of Malta.\n\n===Special duties===\n[[File:HMS Kimberley Winston Churchill.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Winston Churchill with members of ''Kimberley's'' crew]]\nIn July she was nominated to take part in special duties during the planned allied landings in the south of France ([[Operation Dragoon]]).  On 14 August she embarked Admiral [[John H. D. Cunningham|John Cunningham]], the Commander in Chief Mediterranean, so that he could monitor the passage of the assault convoys through the [[Straits of Bonifacio]].  He then sent the signal to commence Operation Dragoon whilst aboard ''Kimberley''.  On 15 August ''Kimberley'' embarked [[Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]], for a visit to the assault area, and on 16 August she re-embarked Cunningham, with the military commander [[Henry Maitland Wilson, 1st Baron Wilson|General Henry Maitland Wilson]], for a visit to the landing beaches.  After she had been released from special duties, ''Kimberley'' was sent to patrol in the [[Adriatic Sea]], supporting military operations.  She joined up with the destroyers [[HMS Undine (R42)|HMS ''Undine'']], [[HMS Urchin (R99)|HMS ''Urchin'']] and [[HMS Loyal (G15)|HMS ''Loyal'']], and the river gunboats [[HMS Aphis (1915)|HMS ''Aphis'']] and [[HMS Scarab|HMS ''Scarab'']], in preparation for supporting the British Army's advance up the east coast of Italy.\n\n===Off the Greek coast===\n[[File:HMS Kimberley German surrender.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The German delegation, aboard a captured British motor launch, come alongside ''Kimberley'' to formally surrender]]\nOn 1 September she began a series of bombardments in the [[Rimini]] area, and having completed these by 13 September she resumed her patrolling.  In October she was transferred to the British Aegean Force, in order to support the landings to reoccupy the Greek mainland (Operation Manna).  She intercepted the hospital ship ''Gradisca'' on 29 October, and took her as a prize.  She carried out interception patrols throughout November, in order to prevent the evacuation of German personnel from occupied territory.  On 5 November she sank an ''F lighter'' off [[Piscopi]] and carried out a bombardment at [[Alimnia]] on 11 November.  She remained in the Aegean throughout December and in January 1945 was acting in support of operations on the Greek mainland.  She was at [[Athens]] during the communist rising.\n\n''Kimberley'' took part in a raid on [[Rhodes]] on 1 May with [[HMS Catterick (L81)|HMS ''Catterick'']] and the [[HMS Hursley (L84)|Greek destroyer ''Kriti'']].  She was off Rhodes on 8 May 1945 when Major General Wagner, Commander of German forces in the Dodecanese, and two of his staff officers came aboard her to formally surrender.  They came alongside on a motor launch they had captured from the British some months previously.<ref>[http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/4460.html Uboat.net]</ref>  The ''Kimberley'' took Wagner to the island of [[Symi]], where the unconditional surrender of German forces in the region was signed.  ''Kimberley'' landed an armed party the next day and confined the Germans to quarters.  She later transported the 117 Germans to Alexandria.  She remained in the Mediterranean after the end of the war, taking passage to the UK in August.  She was paid off in September, was de-stored and then reduced to the [[reserve fleet|reserve]].\n\n==Post war==\n[[File:Kimberley 100dpi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|HMS Kimberley (G50) laid up in Dartmouth after WWII]]\n''Kimberley'' was initially laid up at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]], but was then transferred to [[Harwich]].  She was placed on the disposal list in 1948, and was then selected to take part in ship target trials in the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] area.  She was towed there from Harwich, and after these had been completed, she was sold to West of Scotland Shipbreakers on 30 March 1949.  HMS ''Kimberley'' arrived at their yards at [[Troon]] in June for scrapping, one of only two of the K class to have survived the war.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Colledge}}\n* {{cite book|last=English|first=John|title=Afridi to Nizam: British Fleet Destroyers 1937\u201343|publisher=World Ship Society|location=Gravesend, Kent|year=2001|isbn=0-905617-64-9}}\n* {{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Norman|title=British Destroyers & Frigates: The Second World War and After|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|date=2006|isbn=1-86176-137-6}}\n* {{cite book|last=Haarr|first=Geirr H.|title=The Battle for Norway: April\u2013June 1940|year=2010|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, MD|isbn=978-1-59114-051-1}}\n* {{cite book|last=Haarr|first=Geirr H.|title=The German Invasion of Norway, April 1940|year=2009|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|isbn=978-1-59114-310-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/germaninvasionof00geir}}\n* {{cite book|last=Langtree|first=Charles|title=The Kelly's: British J, K, and N Class Destroyers of World War II |year=2002|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|isbn=1-55750-422-9}}\n* {{cite book|last=Lenton|first=H.

She served in the [[Second World War]] and survived it, being one of only two of the K-class to do so.  So far she has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name ''Kimberley'', after the town of [[Kimberley, Northern Cape]], site of the [[Siege of Kimberley]] in the [[Second Boer War]].  She was adopted by the civil community of [[Eastwood, Nottinghamshire|Eastwood]], [[Kimberley, Nottinghamshire|Kimberley]] and [[Selston]], [[Nottinghamshire]] in 1942 after a successful [[Warship Week]] campaign for National Savings.\n\n==Construction and commissioning==\n''Kimberley'' was ordered from the yards of [[John I. Thornycroft & Company]], [[Woolston, Hampshire]] under the 1937 Programme.  She was laid down on 17 January 1938 as Yard No 1179.  She was launched on 1 June 1939 and commissioned on 21 December, though final works were not completed until early the following year.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Norway and the North Sea===\n''Kimberley'' spent January 1940 carrying out contractors' trials.  She finished the trials and had completed storing and weapon system calibrations by February, and took passage to [[Scapa Flow]] to join the units of the [[Home Fleet]].  On 21 February she was deployed with the [[cruiser]] [[HMS Manchester (15)|HMS ''Manchester'']] in the [[Western Approaches|North Western Approaches]], carrying out patrols to intercept merchant shipping returning to [[Germany]] and [[commerce raiders]] attempting to attack [[Battle of the Atlantic|Atlantic convoys]].  During this patrol, the two ships captured the German freighter {{SS|Wahehe|1922|2}}.  ''Kimberley'' provided a boarding party and the ship was taken into [[Kirkwall]] as a prize.\n\nShe remained with the Home Fleet carrying out patrol duties throughout March.  On 7 April she formed part of a screen for the [[battleship]]s [[HMS Rodney (29)|HMS ''Rodney'']] and {{HMS|Valiant|1914|6}}, the [[battlecruiser]] [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']] and the cruisers of the Home Fleet during a search in the North Western Approaches for German ships that had been reported on passage into the Atlantic.  Actually, these ships were part of [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the German invasion of [[Norway]].  On 8 April, after the invasion, ''Kimberley'' remained as part of the screen for allied ships preparing to land in Norway as part of [[Operation Wilfred]].  She was detached with [[HMS Bedouin (F67)|HMS ''Bedouin'']], [[HMS Eskimo (F75)|HMS ''Eskimo'']] and [[HMS Punjabi (F21)|HMS ''Punjabi'']] later in the day to go to the assistance of [[HMS Glowworm (H92)|HMS ''Glowworm'']], which was under attack by the [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper|German cruiser ''Admiral Hipper'']].  Before the British destroyers could come to the relief, the ''Glowworm'' was sunk with heavy loss of life.\n\n''Kimberley'' was dispatched with HMS ''Eskimo'' and {{HMS|Penelope|97|6}} on 11 April to attack German transports that had been reported at [[Bod\u00f8]].  ''Penelope'' ran aground whilst attempting to enter the fjord at [[Fleinv\u00e6r]], and had to be towed clear by ''Eskimo''.  They then successfully entered the fjord but did not find any ships.  They returned to support fleet operations off [[Narvik]].  ''Kimberley'' then took part in the [[Battles of Narvik#Second Naval Battle of Narvik|Second Battle of Narvik]], during which she attempted to tow [[HMS Cossack (F03)|HMS ''Cossack'']] to safety, after ''Cossack'' had been damaged by German destroyers and disabled.  The attempt failed, but ''Cossack'' was later towed clear by [[HMS Forester (H74)|HMS ''Forester'']].  ''Kimberley'' was left on patrol at Narvik. Several crew members were killed when a boarding party was sent into Narvik to disable a German seaplane. ''Kimberley'' then returned to Scapa Flow.\n\n===Arrival in the Mediterranean===\nShe was nominated to serve in the Mediterranean in May, and underwent preparation for foreign service that saw the damage sustained during the Norwegian operations being repaired.  Her pennant number was also changed, to G50.  She left Britain on 16 May, in company with her sisters, [[HMS Kandahar (F28)|HMS ''Kandahar'']] and [[HMS Khartoum (F45)|HMS ''Khartoum'']].  They arrived at [[Alexandria]] on 23 April, and all three were nominated for service in the [[Red Sea]], in company with another sister, [[HMS Kingston (F64)|HMS ''Kingston'']].  These actions were part of a series of precautions that were being taken in anticipation of [[Italy]]'s entry to the war on the side of the [[Axis powers]].  Italy had a number of destroyers and [[submarine]]s based in [[Eritrea]], which could threaten British shipping.\n\n''Kimberley'' and her sisters were deployed on convoy defence duties throughout June and July, but in August ''Kimberley'' was nominated to support the evacuation of British nationals from [[Berbera]], in [[British Somaliland]].  She and HMS ''Khandahar'' joined the a taskforce consisting of the cruisers [[HMS Caledon (D53)|HMS ''Caledon'']], [[HMAS Hobart (1939)|HMAS ''Hobart'']], {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}} and [[HMS Carlisle (D67)|HMS ''Carlisle'']], the [[sloop-of-war|sloops]] [[HMAS Parramatta (U44)|HMAS ''Parramatta'']], [[HMS Shoreham (L32)|HMS ''Shoreham'']] and [[HMS Auckland (L61)|HMS ''Auckland'']], the armed boarding vessels ''Chakala'', ''Chakdina'' and ''Laomedon'', and the [[hospital ship]] ''Vita''.  On 16 August they assisted in the evacuation of over 7,000 people from British Somalia, embarking them for passage to [[Colony of Aden|Aden]].\n\n===Convoys through the Red Sea===\nOn 12 September ''Kimberley'' joined the military convoy WS-2A as it passed through the Red Sea as an escort, in company with [[HMS Shropshire (73)|HMS ''Shropshire'']], [[HMS Aukland|HMS ''Auckland'']] and [[HMS Flamingo (L18)|HMS ''Flamingo'']]. She was detached on 14 September. On 20 October she joined [[HMNZS Leander|HMS ''Leander'']] and five sloops of the East Indies Squadron in escorting [[Attack on Convoy BN 7|Convoy BN 7]]. They [[Attack on Convoy BN 7|came under attack]] the following day by four Italian destroyers some 150 miles east of [[Massawa]]. ''Kimberley'' engaged the [[Sauro class destroyer|''Sauro'' class]] [[destroyer]] {{ship|Italian destroyer|Francesco Nullo|1925|2}} and drove her ashore on [[Harmil]] Island. ''Kimberley'' then fired a torpedo at the enemy, but came under fire from shore batteries. She took a hit in her engine room, which disabled her. She was taken in tow by HMS ''Leander'' and brought into [[Port Sudan]]. ''Nullo'' was destroyed the following day by [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[Blenheim bomber]]s. ''Kimberley'' was under repair on 27 October, but was back in action on 31 October, when she resumed convoy defence duties. The damage meant that she was operating at reduced speed.\n\n''Kimberley'' and HMS ''Caledon'' escorted the troopships [[SS Duchess of York|SS ''Duchess of York'']] and [[SS Georgic|SS ''Georgic'']] from Aden to the military convoy WS-3 in the Red Sea on 12 November. She was detached on 14 November and returned to Aden. She continued to escort military convoys throughout December, this time in company with HMS ''Carlisle'' and HMS ''Kandahar''. ''Kimberley'' took passage to [[Bombay]] in January 1941 to complete repairs, which lasted throughout February.  She rejoined the [[Mediterranean Fleet (United Kingdom)|Mediterranean Fleet]] at Alexandria in March and began deployments with them in April. On 16 April she was part of the screen for the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Formidable|67|6}}, together with the destroyers [[HMS Griffin (H31)|HMS ''Griffin'']], [[HMS Defender (H07)|HMS ''Defender'']] and HMS ''Kingston'' during her passage to [[Suda Bay]] with other fleet units prior to the planned bombardment of [[Tripoli]]. ''Kimberley'' remained offshore with ''Formidable'' during the bombardment on 21 April. The following day she deployed with the fleet screen during the return to Alexandria after the end of the bombardment, arriving on 23 April.\n\n===Covering the Mediterranean convoys===\nShe was quickly deployed again on 26 April, as an escort for [[Convoy AG-15]] to [[Piraeus]], along with [[HMAS Vampire (D68)|HMAS ''Vampire'']] and HMS ''Auckland''.  She was then engaged in the [[Battle of Greece#Evacuation of Commonwealth forces|evacuation of allied troops from Greece]], taking troops off from Raphti on 27 April, and [[Kalamata]] on 29 April.  She left Kalmata for the final time on 1 May.  ''Kimberley'' deployed again on 6 May, with HMS ''Griffin'', [[HMS Havock (H43)|HMS ''Havock'']], [[HMS Hereward (H93)|HMS ''Hereward'']], [[HMS Hero (H99)|HMS ''Hero'']], [[HMS Hotspur (H01)|HMS ''Hotspur'']], [[HMS Jervis (F00)|HMS ''Jervis'']], [[HMS Juno (F46)|HMS ''Juno'']], HMS ''Kandahar'', HMS ''Kingston'' [[HMAS Nizam (G38)|HMS ''Nizam'']] and [[HMS Nubian (F36)|HMS ''Nubian'']], as a screen for HMS ''Formidable'', the battleships [[HMS Barham (04)|HMS ''Barham'']], HMS ''Valiant'' and [[HMS Warspite (03)|HMS ''Warspite'']], the cruisers [[HMS Orion (85)|HMS ''Orion'']], [[HMAS Perth (D29)|HMAS ''Perth'']] and [[HMS Abdiel (M39)|HMS ''Abdiel'']] as they provided cover for convoys in the eastern Mediterranean.  These [[Malta Convoys|convoys]] were a convoy from [[Egypt]] to [[Malta]], and a military convoy from Malta to Alexandria with tanks for the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]]. ''Kimberley'' remained deployed with the fleet screen until it arrived at Alexandria on 10 May, having been the target of unsuccessful air attacks.\n\nShe deployed again on 15 May screening fleet units covering convoys to reinforce [[Crete]].  She deployed with [[HMS Janus (F53)|HMS ''Janus'']], [[HMS Hasty (H24)|HMS ''Hasty'']] and HMS ''Hereward'' as a screen for the cruisers [[HMS Dido (37)|HMS ''Dido'']], HMS ''Orion'' and {{HMS|Ajax|22|6}}.  They formed Force D, and on 22 May they intercepted an invasion convoy north of Crete and sank several ships.  They took part in the bombardment of the airfield at [[Scarpanto]] on 23 May and the following day were deployed with [[HMS Decoy (H75)|HMS ''Decoy'']], HMS ''Hotspur'', HMS ''Hereward'', [[HMS Imperial (D09)|HMS ''Imperial'']] and [[HMS Jackal (F22)|HMS ''Jackal'']] as a screen for ''Dido'' and ''Ajax'' as they searched Kaso Strait for invasion craft.  ''Kimberley'' returned to Alexandria on 25 May, sailing again on 28 May with ''Ajax'', ''Orion'' and ''Dido'', screened by ''Hotspur'', ''Hereward'', ''Imperial'' and ''Jackal'' to begin evacuating troops from Crete.  The destroyers reached [[Heraklion]] on 29 May and began to ferry troops to the cruisers offshore.  The British ships came under heavy and sustained air attacks during their return passage, during which both ''Ajax'' and ''Dido'' were badly damaged.\n\n===Evacuating Crete===\n''Kimberley'' returned to Crete on 31 May and began evacuating troops from [[Sphakia]] on 1 June.  She returned to Alexandria on 2 June, and on 6 June was nominated to support military operations in [[Syria]], with HMS ''Kandahar'', ''Jackal'', ''Janus'' and the cruiser {{HMS|Phoebe|43|6}}.  They deployed off Syria on 7 June to intercept [[Vichy French]] destroyers that were attempting to provide support to defending French military units.  The British ships also provided naval gunfire support.  ''Kimberley'' took HMS ''Janus'' in tow on 9 June after ''Janus'' had been disabled in an engagement with several French destroyers.  She towed ''Janus'' to [[Haifa]], coming under attack from Vichy French aircraft as they made the passage.  ''Kimberley'' returned to action on 10 June, when she carried out a bombardment of the Khan bridge area in support of a British military advance.  On 15 June whilst off [[Beirut]], she was involved in an engagement with the French [[Gu\u00e9pard class destroyer|''Gu\u00e9pard'' class destroyers]] ''Guepard'' and ''Valmy''.  ''Kimberley'' remained off the Syrian coast into July, carrying further support bombardments on 4 July, before returning to Alexandria.\n\n===Convoys to Malta===\nOn 22 July she and the destroyers HMS ''Hasty'', ''Havock'', ''Jackal'', [[HMS Jaguar (F34)|''Jaguar'']], ''Jervis'', ''Kandahar'', ''Kingston'', ''Nizam'' and ''Nubian'' formed a screen for the battleships {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}} and ''Valiant'', the cruisers HMS ''Ajax'', HMAS ''Hobart'', HMS ''Leander'', [[HMS Naiad (93)|''Naiad'']], [[HMS Neptune (20)|''Neptune'']], ''Phoebe'' and ''Abdiel'' as they carried out a diversionary operation in the eastern Mediterranean to divert attention away from [[Operation Substance]], a Malta relief convoy.  ''Kimberley'' was deployed in support of army operations against [[Tobruk]], and screening fleet units as they searched for enemy supply convoys throughout August to October 1941.\n\nShe was transferred in November to join the cruisers [[HMS Aurora (12)|HMS ''Aurora'']] and HMS ''Penelope'' as part of [[Force K]].  These ships were based at Malta, and were tasked with the job of intercepting enemy supply convoys bound for North Africa.  ''Kimberley'' took passage to Malta on 22 November with HMS ''Ajax'', ''Neptune'' and ''Kingston'' to reinforce Force K.  They were screened by the cruisers {{HMS|Euryalus|42|6}}, HMS ''Naiad'' and two destroyers as they made this transit.  ''Kimberley'' had her first deployment with the Force on 30 November, when she joined HMS ''Aurora'', ''Penelope'', ''Ajax'', ''Neptune'' and ''Kingston'' in intercepting a supply convoy.  ''Kimberley'' carried out an attack on the convoy off [[Benghazi]], on 1 December and succeeded in sinking the ammunition ship ''Adriatico''.  She was in action again the following day, when she took part in the sinking of the [[Italian destroyer Alvise Da Mosto|Italian destroyer ''Alvise Da Mosto'']] and the merchant ''Mantovani'' off Kerkenah Bank.\n\nShe next sailed from Malta on 5 December, with HMS ''Kingston'' and [[HMS Lively (G40)|''Lively'']], and the cruisers ''Ajax'' and ''Neptune''.  They formed the escort for the fast supply ship [[HMS Breconshire|HMS ''Breconshire'']], during her passage to meet the ships out of Alexandria.  ''Ajax'', ''Neptune'' and ''Lively'' were detached on 6 December and returned to Malta.  ''Kimberley'' remained with the ''Breconshire''.  They were joined on 7 December by HMAS ''Hobart'', but she was soon detached to go to the assistance of HMS ''Flamingo'', which had been damaged off Tobruk.  ''Kimberley'' and ''Kingston'' arrived at Alexandria with the ''Breconshire'' on 8 December.  On 15 December ''Kimberley'' joined the cruisers HMS ''Carlisle'', ''Euryalus'' and ''Naiad'' and the destroyers ''Hasty'', ''Havock'', ''Jervis'', ''Kingston'', [[HMS Kipling (F91)|''Kipling'']], ''Decoy'' and ''Nizam'' in forming Force C, which was assigned to escort the ''Breconshire'' to Malta.  By 16 December unconfirmed reports of Italian battle group escorting a supply convoy to Benghazi had reached the British force.  The force was sighted on 17 December, and the ''Breconshire'' was detached from Force C, escorted by ''Decoy'' and ''Havock''.  ''Kimberley'' remained with Force C.  A brief engagement followed, later becoming known as the [[First Battle of Sirte]], in which the Italian warships withdrew after the British destroyers attempted to approach to make torpedo attacks.  ''Kimberley'' returned to Alexandria on 18 December with the rest of the escorts.\n\n===Torpedoing===\n1942 saw her deployed in support of the Tobruk garrison, as well as continued to provide escort and defence for convoys.  On 12 January, whilst off Tobruk she was struck by a torpedo fired by [[German submarine U-77 (1940)|''U-77'']].  ''Kimberley'' sustained major damage to her stern, and had to be taken in tow by [[HMS Heythrop (L85)|HMS ''Heythrop'']] and was towed to Alexandria.  She spent February to December 1942, and all of 1943 under repair, first at Alexandria, then at Bombay.  After trials and work-up between January and March 1944, she was finally ready to return to service.  She returned to the Mediterranean in April and was put back on her usual patrol duties.  She was patrolling on 27 May with HMS ''Aurora'', when she and the [[Free French]] destroyers [[French destroyer Le Malin|''Le Malin'']], [[French destroyer Le Terrible|''Le Terrible'']] and [[French destroyer Le Fantasque|''Le Fantasque'']] were damaged in heavy weather and forced to return to Alexandria for repairs.  The repairs were completed by June and ''Kimberley'' moved to be based out of Malta.\n\n===Special duties===\n[[File:HMS Kimberley Winston Churchill.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Winston Churchill with members of ''Kimberley's'' crew]]\nIn July she was nominated to take part in special duties during the planned allied landings in the south of France ([[Operation Dragoon]]).  On 14 August she embarked Admiral [[John H. D. Cunningham|John Cunningham]], the Commander in Chief Mediterranean, so that he could monitor the passage of the assault convoys through the [[Straits of Bonifacio]].  He then sent the signal to commence Operation Dragoon whilst aboard ''Kimberley''.  On 15 August ''Kimberley'' embarked [[Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]], for a visit to the assault area, and on 16 August she re-embarked Cunningham, with the military commander [[Henry Maitland Wilson, 1st Baron Wilson|General Henry Maitland Wilson]], for a visit to the landing beaches.  After she had been released from special duties, ''Kimberley'' was sent to patrol in the [[Adriatic Sea]], supporting military operations.  She joined up with the destroyers [[HMS Undine (R42)|HMS ''Undine'']], [[HMS Urchin (R99)|HMS ''Urchin'']] and [[HMS Loyal (G15)|HMS ''Loyal'']], and the river gunboats [[HMS Aphis (1915)|HMS ''Aphis'']] and [[HMS Scarab|HMS ''Scarab'']], in preparation for supporting the British Army's advance up the east coast of Italy.\n\n===Off the Greek coast===\n[[File:HMS Kimberley German surrender.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The German delegation, aboard a captured British motor launch, come alongside ''Kimberley'' to formally surrender]]\nOn 1 September she began a series of bombardments in the [[Rimini]] area, and having completed these by 13 September she resumed her patrolling.  In October she was transferred to the British Aegean Force, in order to support the landings to reoccupy the Greek mainland (Operation Manna).  She intercepted the hospital ship ''Gradisca'' on 29 October, and took her as a prize.  She carried out interception patrols throughout November, in order to prevent the evacuation of German personnel from occupied territory.  On 5 November she sank an ''F lighter'' off [[Piscopi]] and carried out a bombardment at [[Alimnia]] on 11 November.  She remained in the Aegean throughout December and in January 1945 was acting in support of operations on the Greek mainland.  She was at [[Athens]] during the communist rising.\n\n''Kimberley'' took part in a raid on [[Rhodes]] on 1 May with [[HMS Catterick (L81)|HMS ''Catterick'']] and the [[HMS Hursley (L84)|Greek destroyer ''Kriti'']].  She was off Rhodes on 8 May 1945 when Major General Wagner, Commander of German forces in the Dodecanese, and two of his staff officers came aboard her to formally surrender.  They came alongside on a motor launch they had captured from the British some months previously.<ref>[http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/4460.html Uboat.net]</ref>  The ''Kimberley'' took Wagner to the island of [[Symi]], where the unconditional surrender of German forces in the region was signed.  ''Kimberley'' landed an armed party the next day and confined the Germans to quarters.  She later transported the 117 Germans to Alexandria.  She remained in the Mediterranean after the end of the war, taking passage to the UK in August.  She was paid off in September, was de-stored and then reduced to the [[reserve fleet|reserve]].\n\n==Post war==\n[[File:Kimberley 100dpi.jpg|thumb|right|250px|HMS Kimberley (G50) laid up in Dartmouth after WWII]]\n''Kimberley'' was initially laid up at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]], but was then transferred to [[Harwich]].  She was placed on the disposal list in 1948, and was then selected to take part in ship target trials in the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] area.  She was towed there from Harwich, and after these had been completed, she was sold to West of Scotland Shipbreakers on 30 March 1949.  HMS ''Kimberley'' arrived at their yards at [[Troon]] in June for scrapping, one of only two of the K class to have survived the war.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Colledge}}\n* {{cite book|last=English|first=John|title=Afridi to Nizam: British Fleet Destroyers 1937\u201343|publisher=World Ship Society|location=Gravesend, Kent|year=2001|isbn=0-905617-64-9}}\n* {{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Norman|title=British Destroyers & Frigates: The Second World War and After|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|date=2006|isbn=1-86176-137-6}}\n* {{cite book|last=Haarr|first=Geirr H.|title=The Battle for Norway: April\u2013June 1940|year=2010|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, MD|isbn=978-1-59114-051-1}}\n* {{cite book|last=Haarr|first=Geirr H.|title=The German Invasion of Norway, April 1940|year=2009|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|isbn=978-1-59114-310-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/germaninvasionof00geir}}\n* {{cite book|last=Langtree|first=Charles|title=The Kelly's: British J, K, and N Class Destroyers of World War II |year=2002|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|isbn=1-55750-422-9}}\n* {{cite book|last=Lenton|first=H.

Water is a good polar [[solvent]], that dissolves many [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[hydrophilic]] organic molecules such as sugars and simple alcohols such as [[ethanol]]. Water also dissolves many gases, such as oxygen and [[carbon dioxide]]\u2014the latter giving the fizz of [[carbonation|carbonated]] beverages, [[sparkling wine]]s and beers. In addition, many substances in living organisms, such as [[protein]]s, [[DNA]] and [[polysaccharide]]s, are dissolved in water.

Many inorganic substances are insoluble too, including most metal [[oxide]]s, [[sulfide]]s, and [[silicate]]s.\n\nBecause of its polarity, a molecule of water in the liquid or solid state can form up to four [[hydrogen bonds]] with neighboring molecules.

Condensed atmospheric water can be seen as clouds, contributing to the Earth's [[albedo]].]]\n\nHydrology is the study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth. The study of the distribution of water is [[hydrography]]. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is [[hydrogeology]], of glaciers is [[glaciology]], of inland waters is [[limnology]] and distribution of oceans is [[oceanography]]. Ecological processes with hydrology are in focus of [[ecohydrology]].\n\nThe collective mass of water found on, under, and over the surface of a planet is called the [[hydrosphere]]. Earth's approximate water volume (the total water supply of the world) is 1.386 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> cubic kilometers (3.33 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> cubic miles).<ref name=b1 />\n\nLiquid water is found in [[body of water|bodies of water]], such as an ocean, sea, lake, river, stream, [[canal]], pond, or [[puddle]]. The majority of water on Earth is [[sea water]]. Water is also present in the atmosphere in solid, liquid, and vapor states. It also exists as groundwater in [[aquifer]]s.\n\nWater is important in many geological processes. Groundwater is present in most [[rock (geology)|rocks]], and the pressure of this groundwater affects patterns of [[fault (geology)|faulting]]. Water in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] is responsible for the melt that produces [[volcano]]es at [[subduction zone]]s. On the surface of the Earth, water is important in both chemical and physical [[weathering]] processes. Water, and to a lesser but still significant extent, ice, are also responsible for a large amount of [[sediment transport]] that occurs on the surface of the earth. [[Deposition (geology)|Deposition]] of transported sediment forms many types of [[sedimentary rock]]s, which make up the [[geologic record]] of [[History of the Earth|Earth history]].\n\n===Water cycle===\n{{Main|Water cycle}}\n[[File:Water cycle.png|thumb|[[Water cycle]]]]\n\nThe [[water cycle]] (known scientifically as the hydrologic cycle) refers to the continuous exchange of water within the [[hydrosphere]], between the [[Earth atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[soil]] water, [[surface water]], [[groundwater]], and plants.\n\nWater moves perpetually through each of these regions in the ''water cycle'' consisting of the following transfer processes:\n* [[evaporation]] from oceans and other water bodies into the air and [[transpiration]] from land plants and animals into the air.\n* [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], from water vapor condensing from the air and falling to the earth or ocean.\n* [[runoff (water)|runoff]] from the land usually reaching the sea.\nMost water vapor over the oceans returns to the oceans, but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea, about 47&nbsp;[[Metric tonne unit|Tt]] per year.

Rivers and seas offer opportunity for travel and commerce. Through [[erosion]], runoff shapes the environment creating river [[valley]]s and [[river delta|deltas]] which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers. A flood occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. It is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea.

The physical properties of sea water differ from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower temperature (about {{convert|-1.9|C}}) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing. The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the [[Baltic Sea]] to 4.0% in the [[Red Sea]]. (The [[Dead Sea]], known for its ultra-high salinity levels of between 30\u201340%, is really a [[salt lake]].)\n\n[[Tide]]s are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the [[tidal force]]s of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and [[estuary|estuarine]] water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams. The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the [[Coriolis effect|effects of Earth rotation]] and the local [[bathymetry]]. The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the [[intertidal zone]], is an important ecological product of ocean tides.\n\n==Effects on life==\n[[File:Oasis in Lybia.JPG|thumb|left|An [[oasis]] is an isolated [[water source]] with vegetation in a [[desert]].]]\n[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.svg|thumb|right|Overview of [[photosynthesis]] <span style=\"color:green;\">(green)</span> and [[cellular respiration|respiration]] <span style=\"color:red;\">(red)</span>]]. Water (at right), together with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), form oxygen and organic compounds (at left), which can be respired to water and (CO<sub>2</sub>).]]\n\nFrom a [[biology|biological]] standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life. It carries out this role by allowing [[organic compound]]s to react in ways that ultimately allow [[Self-replication|replication]]. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a [[solvent]] in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of [[anabolism]] and [[catabolism]]. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g., starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g., glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.\n\nWater is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Hydrogen is combined with CO<sub>2</sub> (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO<sub>2</sub> in the process (cellular respiration).\n\nWater is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a [[pH]] (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. [[Acids]] have pH values less than 7 while [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] have values greater than 7.\n\n===Aquatic life forms===\n{{Further|Hydrobiology|Marine life|Aquatic plant}}\n[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright|Some of the [[biodiversity]] of a [[coral reef]]]]\n[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|Some marine [[diatom]]s \u2013 a key [[phytoplankton]] group]]\nEarth surface waters are filled with life. The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all fish live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales. Some kinds of animals, such as [[amphibian]]s, spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Plants such as [[kelp]] and [[algae]] grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. [[Plankton]] is generally the foundation of the ocean [[food chain]].\n\nAquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways. Fish have [[gills]] instead of [[lungs]], although some species of fish, such as the [[lungfish]], have both. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as dolphins, whales, [[otter]]s, and [[pinniped|seals]] need to surface periodically to breathe air. Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see [[Siphon (insect)|insect]] and [[Siphon (mollusc)|mollusc siphons]]) and [[gills]] (''[[Carcinus]]''). However as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialization for respiration in water.\n\n==Effects on human civilization==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Longwood Gardens-Italian Garden.jpg|thumb|right|Water [[fountain]]]]\n\nCivilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; [[Mesopotamia]], the so-called cradle of civilization, was situated between the major rivers [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]; the ancient society of the [[Egyptians]] depended entirely upon the [[Nile]]. Rome was also founded on the banks of the Italian river [[Tiber]]. Large [[metropolis]]es like [[Rotterdam]], London, Montreal, Paris, New York City, [[Buenos Aires]], Shanghai, Tokyo, Chicago, and Hong Kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade. Islands with safe water ports, like Singapore, have flourished for the same reason. In places such as North Africa and the Middle East, where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.\n\n===Health and pollution===\n[[File:Field Trip- water sampling.jpg|thumb|An environmental science program \u2013 a student from [[Iowa State University]] sampling water]]\nWater fit for human consumption is called [[drinking water]] or potable water. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or [[distillation]], or by a range of [[Water treatment|other methods]].\n\nWater that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called [[safe water]], or \"safe for bathing\". Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1\u20132 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water). Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as [[chlorine]] or [[ozone]] or by the use of [[ultraviolet]] light.\n\nIn the US, non-potable forms of [[wastewater]] generated by humans may be referred to as [[greywater]], which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again, and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], which generally contains [[sewage]] and other forms of waste which require [[Sewage treatment|further treatment]] in order to be made reusable. Greywater composes 50\u201380% of residential wastewater generated by a household's sanitation equipment ([[sink]]s, showers and kitchen runoff, but not toilets, which generate blackwater.) These terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures.\n\nThis natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places, and its availability is a major social and economic concern. Currently, about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. In 2000, the [[United Nations]] established the [[Millennium Development Goals]] for water to halve by 2015 the proportion of people worldwide without access to safe water and [[sanitation]]. Progress toward that goal was uneven, and in 2015 the UN committed to the following targets set by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] of achieving universal access to safe and affordable water and sanitation by 2030. Poor [[water quality]] and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by water-related diseases. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that [[safe water]] could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from [[diarrhea]] each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/qa/70/en/ |title=World Health Organization.

At the time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense, giving rise to the concept of [[peak water]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gleick |first=P.H. |title=Peak Water |url=http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |accessdate=11 October 2011 |year=2010 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1004812107 |pmid=20498082 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107 |issue=125 |pages=11155\u201311162 |last2=Palaniappan |first2=M. |bibcode=2010PNAS..10711155G |pmc=2895062 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108224340/http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |archive-date=8 November 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> This is because there are now nearly eight billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry, urbanization and biofuel crops.

(Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life: [[A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]].'' Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.</ref> It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of [[physical water scarcity]], where there is not enough water to meet all demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing [[economic water scarcity]], where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.<ref>Chartres, C. and Varma, S.

The percentage of the heavier isotopes is very small, but it still affects the properties of water. Water from rivers and lakes tends to contain less heavy isotopes than seawater.

In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds, as well as other polar compounds such as [[ammonia]] and [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|compounds closely related to water]]. In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is [[amphoteric]] (acidic ''and'' basic) and [[nucleophilic]]. Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable. Also, acceleration of [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s by water has been observed. [[Supercritical water]] has recently been a topic of research. Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently. Water vapor is used for some processes in the chemical industry. An example is the production of acrylic acid from acrolein, propylene and propane.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The reaction network in propane oxidation over phase-pure MoVTeNb M1 oxide catalysts|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2014|volume=311|pages=369\u2013385|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2013.12.008|last1=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first1=Raoul|last2=Csepei|first2=L\u00e9n\u00e1rd-Istv\u00e1n|last3=H\u00e4vecker|first3=Michael|last4=Girgsdies|first4=Frank|last5=Schuster|first5=Manfred E|last6=Schl\u00f6gl|first6=Robert|last7=Trunschke|first7=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0014-F434-5|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215104605/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|archive-date=15 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Surface chemistry of phase-pure M1 MoVTeNb oxide during operation in selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2012|volume=285|pages=48\u201360|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2011.09.012|last1=H\u00e4vecker|first1=Michael|last2=Wrabetz|first2=Sabine|last3=Kr\u00f6hnert|first3=Jutta|last4=Csepei|first4=Lenard-Istvan|last5=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first5=Raoul|last6=Kolen'Ko|first6=Yury V|last7=Girgsdies|first7=Frank|last8=Schl\u00f6gl|first8=Robert|last9=Trunschke|first9=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-1BEB-F|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030003154/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Kinetic studies of propane oxidation on Mo and V based mixed oxide catalysts|date=2011|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220044522/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Multifunctionality of Crystalline MoV(TeNb) M1 Oxide Catalysts in Selective Oxidation of Propane and Benzyl Alcohol|journal=ACS Catalysis|date=2013|volume=3|issue=6|pages=1103\u20131113|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|doi=10.1021/cs400010q|last1=Amakawa|first1=Kazuhiko|last2=Kolen'Ko|first2=Yury V|last3=Villa|first3=Alberto|last4=Schuster|first4=Manfred E/|last5=Csepei|first5=L\u00e9n\u00e1rd-Istv\u00e1n|last6=Weinberg|first6=Gisela|last7=Wrabetz|first7=Sabine|last8=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first8=Raoul|last9=Girgsdies|first9=Frank|last10=Prati|first10=Laura|last11=Schl\u00f6gl|first11=Robert|last12=Trunschke|first12=Annette|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022030814/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|archive-date=22 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The possible effect of water in these reactions includes the physical-, chemical interaction of water with the catalyst and the chemical reaction of water with the reaction intermediates.\n\n====Heat exchange====\nWater and steam are a common fluid used for [[heat exchanger|heat exchange]], due to its availability and high [[Heat capacity of water|heat capacity]], both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through [[vaporization]] and [[condensation]] of water because of its large [[latent heat of vaporization]]. A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are [[oxidation|oxidized]] faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all [[thermal power station]]s, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by [[evaporation]] in a [[cooling tower]]). In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.<ref name=\"Water Use in the United States\">[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html Water Use in the United States], National Atlas.gov  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814045418/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html |date=14 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[nuclear power]] industry, water can also be used as a [[neutron moderator]]. In most [[nuclear reactor]]s, water is both a coolant and a moderator. This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also [[void coefficient|slows the nuclear reaction down]]. However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.\n\n====Fire considerations====\n[[File:MH-60S Helicopter dumps water onto Fire.jpg|right|thumb|Water is used for [[fire fighting|fighting]] [[wildfire]]s.]]\nWater has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good [[Fire fighting#Use of water|fire extinguishing]] fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.\n\nUse of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a [[steam explosion]], which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces, and of a hydrogen explosion, when substances which react with water, such as certain metals or hot carbon such as coal, [[charcoal]], or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] graphite, decompose the water, producing [[water gas]].\n\nThe power of such explosions was seen in the [[Chernobyl disaster]], although the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor's own water cooling system. A steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam. A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of reaction between steam and hot [[zirconium]].\n\nSome metallic oxides, most notably those of [[alkali metals]] and [[alkaline earth metals]], produce so much heat on reaction with water that a fire hazard can develop. The alkaline earth oxide [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] is a mass-produced substance which is often transported in paper bags. If these are soaked through, they may ignite as their contents react with water.<ref>{{cite web |title=Material Safety Data Sheet: Quicklime |url=https://www.lhoist.com/sites/lhoist/files/lna_msds_quicklime_2012-3.pdf |publisher=Lhoist North America |date=6 August 2012 |accessdate=24 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705030051/http://www.lhoist.com/sites/lhoist/files/lna_msds_quicklime_2012-3.pdf |archive-date=5 July 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Recreation====\n{{Main|Water sport (recreation)}}\n[[File:Johny Cay.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Andr\u00e9s (island)|San Andr\u00e9s island]], [[Colombia]].]]\n\nHumans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports. Some of these include swimming, [[waterskiing]], [[boating]], [[surfing]] and [[Underwater diving|diving]]. In addition, some sports, like [[ice hockey]] and [[ice skating]], are played on ice. Lakesides, beaches and [[water park]]s are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation. Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other life in [[aquarium]]s or ponds for show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports i.e. [[skiing]], [[sledding]], [[snowmobiling]] or [[snowboarding]], which require the water to be frozen.\n\n====Water industry====\n[[File:Water carrier in India.jpg|thumb|upright|A water-carrier in India, 1882. In many places where running water is not available, water has to be transported by people.]]\n[[File:TapWater-china.JPG|thumb|A manual water [[pump]] in China]]\n[[File:Usine Bret MG 1648.jpg|thumb|[[Water purification]] facility]]\n[[File:Reverse osmosis desalination plant.JPG|thumb|[[Reverse osmosis]] (RO) [[desalination]] plant in [[Barcelona]], Spain]]\n\nThe [[water industry]] provides drinking water and [[wastewater]] services (including [[sewage treatment]]) to households and industry. [[Water supply]] facilities include [[water well]]s, [[cistern]]s for [[rainwater harvesting]], [[water supply network]]s, and [[water purification]] facilities, [[water tank]]s, [[water tower]]s, [[water pipe]]s including old [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s are in development.\n\nDrinking water is often collected at [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], extracted from artificial [[Boring (earth)|borings]] (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful [[microbe]]s. Popular methods are [[filter (water)|filtering]] with sand which only removes undissolved material, while [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and [[boiling]] kill harmful microbes. [[Distillation]] does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as [[reverse osmosis]]. [[Desalination]] of abundant [[seawater]] is a more expensive solution used in coastal [[arid]] [[climate]]s.\n\nThe distribution of drinking water is done through [[municipal water system]]s, tanker delivery or as [[bottled water]]. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.\n\nReducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option. In some cities such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to [[Water conservation|conserve fresh water resources]].\n\n[[Water pollution|Polluting water]] may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as [[externality|externalities]] for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. [[Pharmaceuticals]] consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on [[marine biology|aquatic]] life if they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] and if they are not [[biodegradable]].\n\nMunicipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at [[wastewater treatment plant]]s. Mitigation of polluted [[surface runoff]] is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques. (''See'' [[Surface runoff#Mitigation and treatment]].)\n\n====Industrial applications====\nMany industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water, suspension of solids in water [[slurry|slurries]] or using water to dissolve and extract substances, or to wash products or process equipment. Processes such as [[mining]], [[chemical pulping]], [[pulp bleaching]], [[paper manufacturing]], textile production, dyeing, printing, and cooling of power plants use large amounts of water, requiring a dedicated water source, and often cause significant water pollution.\n\nWater is used in [[power generation]]. [[Hydroelectricity]] is electricity obtained from [[hydropower]]. Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.\n\n{{wide image|200407-sandouping-sanxiadaba-4.med.jpg|800px|[[Three Gorges Dam]] is the [[List of the largest hydroelectric power stations|largest hydro-electric power station]].}}\n\nPressurized water is used in [[Hydrodemolition|water blasting]] and [[water jet cutter]]s. Also, very high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting. It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.\n\nWater is also used in many industrial processes and machines, such as the [[steam turbine]] and [[heat exchanger]], in addition to its use as a chemical [[solvent]]. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is [[water pollution|pollution]]. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and discharged coolant water ([[thermal pollution]]). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge.\n\n====Food processing====\n[[File:Cuisson des pates.jpg|thumb|Water can be used to cook foods such as [[noodles]]]]\n\n[[Boiling]], [[steaming]], and [[simmering]] are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xZHUAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA54|title=A Course in Household Arts: Part I|last=Duff|first=Sister Loretto Basil|date=1916|publisher=Whitcomb & Barrows}}</ref> Water is also used for [[dishwashing]]. Water also plays many critical roles within the field of [[food science]].\n\n[[Solution|Solutes]] such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as [[air pressure]], which is in turn affected by altitude. Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations. One [[mole (unit)|mole]] of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by {{convert|0.51|C-change|3}}, and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by {{convert|1.02|C-change|3}}; similarly, increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water's freezing point.<ref name=\"vaclacik\">{{cite book |title=Essentials of Food Science |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iCCsvwZrguUC&printsec=frontcover |year=2007 |author1=Vaclavik, Vickie A. |author2=Christian, Elizabeth W |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-69939-4}}</ref>\n\nSolutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food.<ref name=\"deman\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kDYJ7a1HbD0C&pg=PA434 |title=Principles of Food Chemistry |year=1999 |author=DeMan, John M |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-8342-1234-3}}</ref> Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water.<ref name=\"vaclacik\" /> Solutes in water lower water activity\u2014this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity.<ref name=\"deman\" /> Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.\n\n[[Water hardness]] is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system.

Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made. Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context. Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the [[International Water Management Institute]] of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken.

Faiths that incorporate ritual washing ([[Ritual purification|ablution]]) include [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Shinto]], [[Taoism]], and [[Wicca]]. Immersion (or [[aspersion]] or [[affusion]]) of a person in water is a central [[sacrament]] of Christianity (where it is called [[baptism]]); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam (''[[Ghusl]]''), Judaism (''[[mikvah]]'') and [[Sikhism]] (''[[Amrit Sanskar]]''). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (''[[wudu]]''), unless water is unavailable (see ''[[Tayammum]]''). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of ''[[misogi]]'').\n\nIn Christianity, [[holy water]] is water that has been sanctified by a priest for the purpose of [[baptism]], the [[Blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|blessing]] of persons, places, and objects, or as a means of repelling evil.<ref>''Chambers's encyclop\u00e6dia'', Lippincott & Co (1870). p. 394.</ref><ref>Altman, Nathaniel (2002) ''Sacred water: the spiritual source of life''. pp. 130\u2013133. {{ISBN|1-58768-013-0}}.</ref>\n\nIn [[Zoroastrianism]], water (''[[aban|\u0101b]]'') is respected as the source of life.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0100B i.

[[Thales]], who was portrayed by Aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from the water. Thales, a [[monist]], believed further that all things are made from water. Plato believed the shape of water is an [[icosahedron]] which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube-shaped earth.<ref>Lindberg, D. (2008). ''The beginnings of western science: The European scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context, prehistory to A.D. 1450''. (2nd ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\nIn the theory of the [[humorism|four bodily humors]], water was associated with [[phlegm]], as being cold and moist. The [[Water (classical element)|classical element of water]] was also one of the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five elements]] in traditional [[Chinese philosophy]], along with [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[wood (classical element)|wood]], and [[metal (classical element)|metal]].\n\nWater is also taken as a role model in some parts of traditional and popular [[Asian philosophy]].

It freezes at a lower temperature (about {{convert|-1.9|C}}) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing. The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the [[Baltic Sea]] to 4.0% in the [[Red Sea]]. (The [[Dead Sea]], known for its ultra-high salinity levels of between 30\u201340%, is really a [[salt lake]].)\n\n[[Tide]]s are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the [[tidal force]]s of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and [[estuary|estuarine]] water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams. The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the [[Coriolis effect|effects of Earth rotation]] and the local [[bathymetry]]. The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the [[intertidal zone]], is an important ecological product of ocean tides.\n\n==Effects on life==\n[[File:Oasis in Lybia.JPG|thumb|left|An [[oasis]] is an isolated [[water source]] with vegetation in a [[desert]].]]\n[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.svg|thumb|right|Overview of [[photosynthesis]] <span style=\"color:green;\">(green)</span> and [[cellular respiration|respiration]] <span style=\"color:red;\">(red)</span>]]. Water (at right), together with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), form oxygen and organic compounds (at left), which can be respired to water and (CO<sub>2</sub>).]]\n\nFrom a [[biology|biological]] standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life. It carries out this role by allowing [[organic compound]]s to react in ways that ultimately allow [[Self-replication|replication]]. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a [[solvent]] in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of [[anabolism]] and [[catabolism]]. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g., starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g., glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.\n\nWater is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Hydrogen is combined with CO<sub>2</sub> (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO<sub>2</sub> in the process (cellular respiration).\n\nWater is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a [[pH]] (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. [[Acids]] have pH values less than 7 while [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] have values greater than 7.\n\n===Aquatic life forms===\n{{Further|Hydrobiology|Marine life|Aquatic plant}}\n[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright|Some of the [[biodiversity]] of a [[coral reef]]]]\n[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|Some marine [[diatom]]s \u2013 a key [[phytoplankton]] group]]\nEarth surface waters are filled with life. The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all fish live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales. Some kinds of animals, such as [[amphibian]]s, spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Plants such as [[kelp]] and [[algae]] grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. [[Plankton]] is generally the foundation of the ocean [[food chain]].\n\nAquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways. Fish have [[gills]] instead of [[lungs]], although some species of fish, such as the [[lungfish]], have both. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as dolphins, whales, [[otter]]s, and [[pinniped|seals]] need to surface periodically to breathe air. Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see [[Siphon (insect)|insect]] and [[Siphon (mollusc)|mollusc siphons]]) and [[gills]] (''[[Carcinus]]''). However as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialization for respiration in water.\n\n==Effects on human civilization==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Longwood Gardens-Italian Garden.jpg|thumb|right|Water [[fountain]]]]\n\nCivilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; [[Mesopotamia]], the so-called cradle of civilization, was situated between the major rivers [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]; the ancient society of the [[Egyptians]] depended entirely upon the [[Nile]]. Rome was also founded on the banks of the Italian river [[Tiber]]. Large [[metropolis]]es like [[Rotterdam]], London, Montreal, Paris, New York City, [[Buenos Aires]], Shanghai, Tokyo, Chicago, and Hong Kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade. Islands with safe water ports, like Singapore, have flourished for the same reason. In places such as North Africa and the Middle East, where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.\n\n===Health and pollution===\n[[File:Field Trip- water sampling.jpg|thumb|An environmental science program \u2013 a student from [[Iowa State University]] sampling water]]\nWater fit for human consumption is called [[drinking water]] or potable water. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or [[distillation]], or by a range of [[Water treatment|other methods]].\n\nWater that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called [[safe water]], or \"safe for bathing\". Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1\u20132 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water). Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as [[chlorine]] or [[ozone]] or by the use of [[ultraviolet]] light.\n\nIn the US, non-potable forms of [[wastewater]] generated by humans may be referred to as [[greywater]], which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again, and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], which generally contains [[sewage]] and other forms of waste which require [[Sewage treatment|further treatment]] in order to be made reusable. Greywater composes 50\u201380% of residential wastewater generated by a household's sanitation equipment ([[sink]]s, showers and kitchen runoff, but not toilets, which generate blackwater.) These terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures.\n\nThis natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places, and its availability is a major social and economic concern. Currently, about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. In 2000, the [[United Nations]] established the [[Millennium Development Goals]] for water to halve by 2015 the proportion of people worldwide without access to safe water and [[sanitation]]. Progress toward that goal was uneven, and in 2015 the UN committed to the following targets set by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] of achieving universal access to safe and affordable water and sanitation by 2030. Poor [[water quality]] and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by water-related diseases. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that [[safe water]] could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from [[diarrhea]] each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/qa/70/en/ |title=World Health Organization.

At the time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense, giving rise to the concept of [[peak water]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gleick |first=P.H. |title=Peak Water |url=http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |accessdate=11 October 2011 |year=2010 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1004812107 |pmid=20498082 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107 |issue=125 |pages=11155\u201311162 |last2=Palaniappan |first2=M. |bibcode=2010PNAS..10711155G |pmc=2895062 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108224340/http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |archive-date=8 November 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> This is because there are now nearly eight billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry, urbanization and biofuel crops.

(Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life: [[A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]].'' Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.</ref> It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of [[physical water scarcity]], where there is not enough water to meet all demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing [[economic water scarcity]], where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.<ref>Chartres, C. and Varma, S.

Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; through [[urine]] and [[feces]], through [[sweat]]ing, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath. With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as well.\n\nHumans require water with few impurities. Common impurities include metal salts and oxides, including copper, iron, calcium and lead,<ref>''Conquering Chemistry'' 4th Ed. Published 2008</ref> and/or harmful bacteria, such as ''[[Vibrio]]''.

Washing is also an important component of several aspects of personal [[body hygiene]]. Most of personal water use is due to [[shower]]ing, doing the [[laundry]] and [[dishwashing]], reaching hundreds of liters per day per person in developed countries.\n\n====Transportation====\n{{Main|Ship transport}}\nThe use of water for transportation of materials through rivers and canals as well as the international shipping lanes is an important part of the world economy.\n\n====Chemical uses====\nWater is widely used in chemical reactions as a [[solvent]] or [[reactant]] and less commonly as a [[solution|solute]] or [[catalyst]]. In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds, as well as other polar compounds such as [[ammonia]] and [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|compounds closely related to water]]. In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is [[amphoteric]] (acidic ''and'' basic) and [[nucleophilic]]. Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable. Also, acceleration of [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s by water has been observed. [[Supercritical water]] has recently been a topic of research. Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently. Water vapor is used for some processes in the chemical industry. An example is the production of acrylic acid from acrolein, propylene and propane.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The reaction network in propane oxidation over phase-pure MoVTeNb M1 oxide catalysts|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2014|volume=311|pages=369\u2013385|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2013.12.008|last1=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first1=Raoul|last2=Csepei|first2=L\u00e9n\u00e1rd-Istv\u00e1n|last3=H\u00e4vecker|first3=Michael|last4=Girgsdies|first4=Frank|last5=Schuster|first5=Manfred E|last6=Schl\u00f6gl|first6=Robert|last7=Trunschke|first7=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0014-F434-5|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215104605/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|archive-date=15 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Surface chemistry of phase-pure M1 MoVTeNb oxide during operation in selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2012|volume=285|pages=48\u201360|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2011.09.012|last1=H\u00e4vecker|first1=Michael|last2=Wrabetz|first2=Sabine|last3=Kr\u00f6hnert|first3=Jutta|last4=Csepei|first4=Lenard-Istvan|last5=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first5=Raoul|last6=Kolen'Ko|first6=Yury V|last7=Girgsdies|first7=Frank|last8=Schl\u00f6gl|first8=Robert|last9=Trunschke|first9=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-1BEB-F|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030003154/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Kinetic studies of propane oxidation on Mo and V based mixed oxide catalysts|date=2011|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220044522/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Multifunctionality of Crystalline MoV(TeNb) M1 Oxide Catalysts in Selective Oxidation of Propane and Benzyl Alcohol|journal=ACS Catalysis|date=2013|volume=3|issue=6|pages=1103\u20131113|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|doi=10.1021/cs400010q|last1=Amakawa|first1=Kazuhiko|last2=Kolen'Ko|first2=Yury V|last3=Villa|first3=Alberto|last4=Schuster|first4=Manfred E/|last5=Csepei|first5=L\u00e9n\u00e1rd-Istv\u00e1n|last6=Weinberg|first6=Gisela|last7=Wrabetz|first7=Sabine|last8=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first8=Raoul|last9=Girgsdies|first9=Frank|last10=Prati|first10=Laura|last11=Schl\u00f6gl|first11=Robert|last12=Trunschke|first12=Annette|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022030814/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|archive-date=22 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The possible effect of water in these reactions includes the physical-, chemical interaction of water with the catalyst and the chemical reaction of water with the reaction intermediates.\n\n====Heat exchange====\nWater and steam are a common fluid used for [[heat exchanger|heat exchange]], due to its availability and high [[Heat capacity of water|heat capacity]], both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through [[vaporization]] and [[condensation]] of water because of its large [[latent heat of vaporization]]. A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are [[oxidation|oxidized]] faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all [[thermal power station]]s, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by [[evaporation]] in a [[cooling tower]]). In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.<ref name=\"Water Use in the United States\">[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html Water Use in the United States], National Atlas.gov  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814045418/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html |date=14 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[nuclear power]] industry, water can also be used as a [[neutron moderator]]. In most [[nuclear reactor]]s, water is both a coolant and a moderator. This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also [[void coefficient|slows the nuclear reaction down]]. However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.\n\n====Fire considerations====\n[[File:MH-60S Helicopter dumps water onto Fire.jpg|right|thumb|Water is used for [[fire fighting|fighting]] [[wildfire]]s.]]\nWater has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good [[Fire fighting#Use of water|fire extinguishing]] fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.\n\nUse of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a [[steam explosion]], which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces, and of a hydrogen explosion, when substances which react with water, such as certain metals or hot carbon such as coal, [[charcoal]], or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] graphite, decompose the water, producing [[water gas]].\n\nThe power of such explosions was seen in the [[Chernobyl disaster]], although the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor's own water cooling system. A steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam. A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of reaction between steam and hot [[zirconium]].\n\nSome metallic oxides, most notably those of [[alkali metals]] and [[alkaline earth metals]], produce so much heat on reaction with water that a fire hazard can develop. The alkaline earth oxide [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] is a mass-produced substance which is often transported in paper bags. If these are soaked through, they may ignite as their contents react with water.<ref>{{cite web |title=Material Safety Data Sheet: Quicklime |url=https://www.lhoist.com/sites/lhoist/files/lna_msds_quicklime_2012-3.pdf |publisher=Lhoist North America |date=6 August 2012 |accessdate=24 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705030051/http://www.lhoist.com/sites/lhoist/files/lna_msds_quicklime_2012-3.pdf |archive-date=5 July 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Recreation====\n{{Main|Water sport (recreation)}}\n[[File:Johny Cay.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Andr\u00e9s (island)|San Andr\u00e9s island]], [[Colombia]].]]\n\nHumans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports. Some of these include swimming, [[waterskiing]], [[boating]], [[surfing]] and [[Underwater diving|diving]]. In addition, some sports, like [[ice hockey]] and [[ice skating]], are played on ice. Lakesides, beaches and [[water park]]s are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation. Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other life in [[aquarium]]s or ponds for show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports i.e. [[skiing]], [[sledding]], [[snowmobiling]] or [[snowboarding]], which require the water to be frozen.\n\n====Water industry====\n[[File:Water carrier in India.jpg|thumb|upright|A water-carrier in India, 1882. In many places where running water is not available, water has to be transported by people.]]\n[[File:TapWater-china.JPG|thumb|A manual water [[pump]] in China]]\n[[File:Usine Bret MG 1648.jpg|thumb|[[Water purification]] facility]]\n[[File:Reverse osmosis desalination plant.JPG|thumb|[[Reverse osmosis]] (RO) [[desalination]] plant in [[Barcelona]], Spain]]\n\nThe [[water industry]] provides drinking water and [[wastewater]] services (including [[sewage treatment]]) to households and industry. [[Water supply]] facilities include [[water well]]s, [[cistern]]s for [[rainwater harvesting]], [[water supply network]]s, and [[water purification]] facilities, [[water tank]]s, [[water tower]]s, [[water pipe]]s including old [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s are in development.\n\nDrinking water is often collected at [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], extracted from artificial [[Boring (earth)|borings]] (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful [[microbe]]s. Popular methods are [[filter (water)|filtering]] with sand which only removes undissolved material, while [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and [[boiling]] kill harmful microbes. [[Distillation]] does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as [[reverse osmosis]]. [[Desalination]] of abundant [[seawater]] is a more expensive solution used in coastal [[arid]] [[climate]]s.\n\nThe distribution of drinking water is done through [[municipal water system]]s, tanker delivery or as [[bottled water]]. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.\n\nReducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option. In some cities such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to [[Water conservation|conserve fresh water resources]].\n\n[[Water pollution|Polluting water]] may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as [[externality|externalities]] for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. [[Pharmaceuticals]] consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on [[marine biology|aquatic]] life if they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] and if they are not [[biodegradable]].\n\nMunicipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at [[wastewater treatment plant]]s. Mitigation of polluted [[surface runoff]] is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques. (''See'' [[Surface runoff#Mitigation and treatment]].)\n\n====Industrial applications====\nMany industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water, suspension of solids in water [[slurry|slurries]] or using water to dissolve and extract substances, or to wash products or process equipment. Processes such as [[mining]], [[chemical pulping]], [[pulp bleaching]], [[paper manufacturing]], textile production, dyeing, printing, and cooling of power plants use large amounts of water, requiring a dedicated water source, and often cause significant water pollution.\n\nWater is used in [[power generation]]. [[Hydroelectricity]] is electricity obtained from [[hydropower]]. Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.\n\n{{wide image|200407-sandouping-sanxiadaba-4.med.jpg|800px|[[Three Gorges Dam]] is the [[List of the largest hydroelectric power stations|largest hydro-electric power station]].}}\n\nPressurized water is used in [[Hydrodemolition|water blasting]] and [[water jet cutter]]s. Also, very high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting. It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.\n\nWater is also used in many industrial processes and machines, such as the [[steam turbine]] and [[heat exchanger]], in addition to its use as a chemical [[solvent]]. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is [[water pollution|pollution]]. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and discharged coolant water ([[thermal pollution]]). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge.\n\n====Food processing====\n[[File:Cuisson des pates.jpg|thumb|Water can be used to cook foods such as [[noodles]]]]\n\n[[Boiling]], [[steaming]], and [[simmering]] are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xZHUAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA54|title=A Course in Household Arts: Part I|last=Duff|first=Sister Loretto Basil|date=1916|publisher=Whitcomb & Barrows}}</ref> Water is also used for [[dishwashing]]. Water also plays many critical roles within the field of [[food science]].\n\n[[Solution|Solutes]] such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as [[air pressure]], which is in turn affected by altitude. Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations. One [[mole (unit)|mole]] of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by {{convert|0.51|C-change|3}}, and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by {{convert|1.02|C-change|3}}; similarly, increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water's freezing point.<ref name=\"vaclacik\">{{cite book |title=Essentials of Food Science |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iCCsvwZrguUC&printsec=frontcover |year=2007 |author1=Vaclavik, Vickie A. |author2=Christian, Elizabeth W |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-69939-4}}</ref>\n\nSolutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food.<ref name=\"deman\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kDYJ7a1HbD0C&pg=PA434 |title=Principles of Food Chemistry |year=1999 |author=DeMan, John M |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-8342-1234-3}}</ref> Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water.<ref name=\"vaclacik\" /> Solutes in water lower water activity\u2014this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity.<ref name=\"deman\" /> Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.\n\n[[Water hardness]] is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system. It can dramatically affect the quality of a product, as well as playing a role in sanitation. Water hardness is classified based on concentration of calcium carbonate the water contains.

Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made. Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context. Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the [[International Water Management Institute]] of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken.

Faiths that incorporate ritual washing ([[Ritual purification|ablution]]) include [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Shinto]], [[Taoism]], and [[Wicca]]. Immersion (or [[aspersion]] or [[affusion]]) of a person in water is a central [[sacrament]] of Christianity (where it is called [[baptism]]); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam (''[[Ghusl]]''), Judaism (''[[mikvah]]'') and [[Sikhism]] (''[[Amrit Sanskar]]''). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (''[[wudu]]''), unless water is unavailable (see ''[[Tayammum]]''). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of ''[[misogi]]'').\n\nIn Christianity, [[holy water]] is water that has been sanctified by a priest for the purpose of [[baptism]], the [[Blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|blessing]] of persons, places, and objects, or as a means of repelling evil.<ref>''Chambers's encyclop\u00e6dia'', Lippincott & Co (1870). p. 394.</ref><ref>Altman, Nathaniel (2002) ''Sacred water: the spiritual source of life''. pp. 130\u2013133. {{ISBN|1-58768-013-0}}.</ref>\n\nIn [[Zoroastrianism]], water (''[[aban|\u0101b]]'') is respected as the source of life.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0100B i.

[[Thales]], who was portrayed by Aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from the water. Thales, a [[monist]], believed further that all things are made from water. Plato believed the shape of water is an [[icosahedron]] which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube-shaped earth.<ref>Lindberg, D. (2008). ''The beginnings of western science: The European scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context, prehistory to A.D. 1450''. (2nd ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\nIn the theory of the [[humorism|four bodily humors]], water was associated with [[phlegm]], as being cold and moist. The [[Water (classical element)|classical element of water]] was also one of the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five elements]] in traditional [[Chinese philosophy]], along with [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[wood (classical element)|wood]], and [[metal (classical element)|metal]].\n\nWater is also taken as a role model in some parts of traditional and popular [[Asian philosophy]].

Getting good management was crucial and EMG has a great track record. Erik has been talking to us since [[Doomsday X]] to record us, and with Gus Rios (Drums) being in the band full time now, we didn't want him to have the responsibility of producing the album as well as writing and playing. Erik really understands what we are about, and has all of the same thoughts about recording as us. It really couldn't be a better working situation. We've said it before but this album really is without a doubt is the most relentless, focused and brutal MALEVOLENT CREATION album ever! We really went back to our roots, not only as a band, but as fans of metal. We wrote an album of songs that we as fans of brutal music would want to hear.\"<ref name=\"a1159\" />\n\nOn October 15, 2014, Malevolent Creation announced that they signed a worldwide record deal with [[Century Media Records]].
