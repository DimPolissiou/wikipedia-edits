Around the same time, another [[Armenians|Armenian]] by the name of [[Arakha]], son of Haldita, claimed to be the son of the last king of [[Babylon]], [[Nabonidus]], and renamed himself [[Nebuchadnezzar IV]]. His rebellion was short lived and was suppressed by [[Intaphrenes]], Darius' bow carrier.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] (331 BC), Orontes III was able to regain independence for Armenia. But in 201 BC, Armenia was conquered by [[Artashes I|Artashes]], a general from the Seleucid Empire, and also said to be a member of Orontid dynasty. The last Orontid king Orontes IV was killed, but the Orontids continued to rule in [[Sophene]] and [[Commagene]] until the 1st century BC.\n\nIn two inscriptions of king [[Antiochus I of Commagene]] on his monument at Mount [[Nemrut (mountain)|Nemrut]], [[Orontes I]] (son of Artasouras and husband of Artaxerxes' daughter Rhodogoune), is reckoned as an ancestor of the Orontids ruling over [[Commagene]], who traced back their family to [[Darius I|Darius the Great]].\n\n[[Image:Silver Rhyton.jpg|thumb|Silver Rhyton, Yerznka, Armenia, 5th century BCE.|none]]\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Orontid Dynasty]]\n*[[Urartu]]\n*[[Achaemenid Empire]]\n*[[Kingdom of Armenia (Antiquity)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Regions of Kingdom of Armenia}}\n{{Armenia topics}}\n{{Achaemenid Provinces}}\n\n{{coord missing|Asia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Satrapy Of Armenia}}\n[[Category:Ancient Armenia]]\n[[Category:Ancient history of Iran]]\n[[Category:Achaemenid satrapies]]\n", "name_user": "Xsayathiya", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Erebuni was never a capital of Armenia (until 1918).

Historians distinguish a significant body of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] words which were used in Armenian pagan rites. The oldest cults are believed to have worshipped a creator called Ar<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=w36gAAAAMAAJ&dq=Armenians+and+Old+Armenia&q=god|title=Armenians and old Armenia: archaeoastronomy, linguistics, oldest history|last=Herouni|first=Paris M.|date=2004|publisher=Tigran Metz Publishing House|language=en|page=127}}</ref>  (or possibly Ara), embodied as the sun (Arev or Areg); the ancient Armenians called themselves \"children of the sun\".

Until the late Parthian period, the Armenian lands adhered to a syncretic form of Mazdaism, which mixed Iranian religious concepts with traditional Armenian beliefs.<ref name=\"boyce84\"/> For example, the supreme god of the Armenian pantheon, Vanatur, was later replaced by [[Aramazd]] (the [[Parthian language|Parthian]] form of [[Ahura Mazda]]).<ref name=\"boyce84\">Mary Boyce. [https://books.google.com/books?id=a6gbxVfjtUEC&pg=PA84 ''Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices''] Psychology Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0415239028}} p 84</ref> However, the Armenian version of Aramazd preserved many native Armenian aspects. Similarly, the traditional Armenian goddess of fertility, Nar, was replaced by [[Anahit]], which may derived from Persian [[Anahita]], although the Armenian goddess was entirely distinct from her Iranian counterpart.\n\nIn the Hellenistic age (3rd to 1st centuries BCE), ancient Armenian deities were identified with ancient Greek deities: [[Aramazd]] with [[Zeus]], [[Anahit]] with [[Artemis]], [[Vahagn]] with [[Hercules]], [[Ast\u0142ik]] with [[Aphrodite]], [[Nane (goddess)|Nane]] with [[Athena]], [[Armenian mythology#Pantheon|Mihr]] with [[Hephaestus]], [[Armenian mythology#Pantheon|Tir]] with [[Apollo]].\n\nAfter the formal adoption of [[Christianity]] in the 4th century CE, ancient myths and beliefs transformed to adhere more closely to Christian beliefs. Biblical characters took over the functions of the archaic gods and spirits. For example, [[John the Baptist]] inherited certain features of Vahagn and Tir, and the archangel [[Gabriel]] took on elements of Vahagn.\n\nBasic information about Armenian pagan traditions were preserved in the works of ancient Greek authors such as [[Plato]], [[Herodotus]], [[Xenophon]] and [[Strabo]], Byzantine scholar [[Procopius]] of Caesarea, as well as medieval Armenian writers such as [[Movses Khorenatsi]], [[Agathangelos]], [[Eznik of Kolb]], [[Sebeos]], and [[Anania Shirakatsi]], as well as in oral folk traditions.\n\n==Pantheon==\nThe pantheon of pre-Christian Armenia changed over the centuries.  Originally native Armenian (from [[Proto-Indo-European culture|Proto-Indo-European]]) in nature, the pantheon was modified through [[Anatolians (Indo-European people)|Anatolian]], [[Hurrian religion|Hurro]]-[[Urartian religion|Urartian]], [[Semitic gods|Semitic]], [[Iranian religions|Iranian]], and [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek]] influences.\n\nOne common motif that spanned many or all pagan Armenian pantheons was the belief in a ruling triad of supreme gods, usually comprising a chief, creator god, his thunder god son, and a mother goddess.\n\n===Early Armenian===\nThese gods are believed to have been native Armenian gods, worshipped during the earliest eras of Armenian history ([[Proto-Armenian]]). Many, if not all, of them are believed to have derived from [[Proto-Indo-European religion]]. There is also likely influence from the indigenous beliefs of the [[Armenian Highlands]].\n\n*'''Arev (Areg)''' or '''Ar''', god of the sun, comparable with Hindu [[Surya|Ravi]].<ref>Martirosyan, Hrach ''Origins and historical development of the Armenian language'' [https://ling.hse.ru/data/2014/09/01/1313574129/Hrach%20Martirosyan%20-%20Handout.pdf](2014) pp. 13</ref> Likely also known as, or developed into, Ara.\n* '''[[Ast\u0142ik]]'''<ref>Petrosyan, Armen ''The Indo-European and Ancient Near Eastern Sources of the Armenian Epic'' [https://www.academia.edu/3656244/The_Indo-European_and_Ancient_Near_Eastern_Sources_of_the_Armenian_Epic._Washington_D.C._2002] (2002) pp. 68.</ref>, cognate to the Mesopotamian goddess [[Inanna]], identified with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].

Historians distinguish a significant body of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] words which were used in Armenian pagan rites. The oldest cults are believed to have worshipped a creator called Ar<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=w36gAAAAMAAJ&dq=Armenians+and+Old+Armenia&q=god|title=Armenians and old Armenia: archaeoastronomy, linguistics, oldest history|last=Herouni|first=Paris M.|date=2004|publisher=Tigran Metz Publishing House|language=en|page=127}}</ref>  (or possibly Ara), embodied as the sun (Arev or Areg); the ancient Armenians called themselves \"children of the sun\".

Until the late Parthian period, the Armenian lands adhered to a syncretic form of Mazdaism, which mixed Iranian religious concepts with traditional Armenian beliefs.<ref name=\"boyce84\"/> For example, the supreme god of the Armenian pantheon, Vanatur, was later replaced by [[Aramazd]] (the [[Parthian language|Parthian]] form of [[Ahura Mazda]]).<ref name=\"boyce84\">Mary Boyce. [https://books.google.com/books?id=a6gbxVfjtUEC&pg=PA84 ''Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices''] Psychology Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0415239028}} p 84</ref> However, the Armenian version of Aramazd preserved many native Armenian aspects. Similarly, the traditional Armenian goddess of fertility, Nar, was replaced by [[Anahit]], which may derived from Persian [[Anahita]], although the Armenian goddess was entirely distinct from her Iranian counterpart.\n\nIn the Hellenistic age (3rd to 1st centuries BCE), ancient Armenian deities were identified with ancient Greek deities: [[Aramazd]] with [[Zeus]], [[Anahit]] with [[Artemis]], [[Vahagn]] with [[Hercules]], [[Ast\u0142ik]] with [[Aphrodite]], [[Nane (goddess)|Nane]] with [[Athena]], [[Armenian mythology#Pantheon|Mihr]] with [[Hephaestus]], [[Armenian mythology#Pantheon|Tir]] with [[Apollo]].\n\nAfter the formal adoption of [[Christianity]] in the 4th century CE, ancient myths and beliefs transformed to adhere more closely to Christian beliefs. Biblical characters took over the functions of the archaic gods and spirits. For example, [[John the Baptist]] inherited certain features of Vahagn and Tir, and the archangel [[Gabriel]] took on elements of Vahagn.\n\nBasic information about Armenian pagan traditions were preserved in the works of ancient Greek authors such as [[Plato]], [[Herodotus]], [[Xenophon]] and [[Strabo]], Byzantine scholar [[Procopius]] of Caesarea, as well as medieval Armenian writers such as [[Movses Khorenatsi]], [[Agathangelos]], [[Eznik of Kolb]], [[Sebeos]], and [[Anania Shirakatsi]], as well as in oral folk traditions.\n\n==Pantheon==\nThe pantheon of pre-Christian Armenia changed over the centuries.  Originally native Armenian (from [[Proto-Indo-European culture|Proto-Indo-European]]) in nature, the pantheon was modified through [[Anatolians (Indo-European people)|Anatolian]], [[Hurrian religion|Hurro]]-[[Urartian religion|Urartian]], [[Semitic gods|Semitic]], [[Iranian religions|Iranian]], and [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek]] influences.\n\nOne common motif that spanned many or all pagan Armenian pantheons was the belief in a ruling triad of supreme gods, usually comprising a chief, creator god, his thunder god son, and a mother goddess.\n\n===Early Armenian===\nThese gods are believed to have been native Armenian gods, worshipped during the earliest eras of Armenian history ([[Proto-Armenian]]). Many, if not all, of them are believed to have derived from [[Proto-Indo-European religion]]. There is also likely influence from the indigenous beliefs of the [[Armenian Highlands]].\n\n*'''Arev (Areg)''' or '''Ar''', god of the sun, comparable with Hindu [[Surya|Ravi]].<ref>Martirosyan, Hrach ''Origins and historical development of the Armenian language'' [https://ling.hse.ru/data/2014/09/01/1313574129/Hrach%20Martirosyan%20-%20Handout.pdf](2014) pp. 13</ref> Likely also known as, or developed into, Ara.\n* '''[[Ast\u0142ik]]'''<ref>Petrosyan, Armen ''The Indo-European and Ancient Near Eastern Sources of the Armenian Epic'' [https://www.academia.edu/3656244/The_Indo-European_and_Ancient_Near_Eastern_Sources_of_the_Armenian_Epic._Washington_D.C._2002] (2002) pp. 68.</ref>, cognate to the Mesopotamian goddess [[Inanna]], identified with [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].

They speak [[Chamic languages]], a subfamily of [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] closely related to the [[Malayic languages|Malayic]] and [[Bali\u2013Sasak languages]].\n\nChampa was preceded in the region by a kingdom called [[L\u00e2m \u1ea4p]] (Vietnamese), or Linyi ({{lang|zh|\u6797\u9091}}, Lim Ip in [[Middle Chinese]]), that was in existence since AD 192; although the historical relationship between Linyi and Champa is not clear. Champa reached its apogee in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. Thereafter, it began a gradual decline under pressure from [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]], the Vietnamese polity centered in the region of modern [[Hanoi]]. In 1832, the Vietnamese emperor [[Minh M\u1ea1ng]] annexed the remaining Cham territories.\n\n[[Hinduism]], adopted through conflicts and conquest of territory from neighboring [[Funan]] in the 4th century AD, shaped the art and culture of the Champa kingdom for centuries, as testified by the many Cham [[Hindus|Hindu]] statues and red brick temples that dotted the landscape in Cham lands. [[M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n]], a former religious center, and [[H\u1ed9i An]], one of Champa's main port cities, are now [[World Heritage Site]]s. Today, many Cham people adhere to [[Islam]], a conversion which began in the 10th century, with the Royals having fully adopted the faith by the 17th century; they are called Bani Cham (from Arabic: [[Banu (Arabic)|Bani]]). There are, however, Balamon Cham (from [[Sanskrit]]: [[Brahman]]) who still retain and preserve their [[Hindus|Hindu]] faith, rituals, and festivals. The Balamon Cham are one of only two surviving non-[[Indian people|Indic]] indigenous [[Hindus|Hindu]] peoples in the world, with a culture dating back thousands of years. The other is the [[Balinese Hinduism]] of the [[Balinese people|Balinese]] of [[Indonesia]].<ref name=\"Brannon\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Champa'' derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word {{IAST|campaka}} (pronounced {{IPA|t\u0283a\u0271paka}}), which refers to ''[[Magnolia champaca]]'', a species of flowering tree known for its fragrant flowers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&script=hk&tran_input=Champa&direct=au|title=Champa, Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit|website=spokensanskrit.org|access-date=2019-01-16}}</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\n\n===Sources===\n\nThe [[historiography]] of Champa relies upon three types of sources:<ref>Vickery, \"Champa Revised\", p.4 ff.</ref>\n* Physical remains, including brick structures and ruins, as well as stone sculptures;\n* Inscriptions in Cham and [[Sanskrit]] on [[stele]]s and other stone surfaces;\n* Chinese and Vietnamese histories, diplomatic reports, and other texts such as those provided by [[Jia Dan]].<ref name=Higham/>{{rp|319}}\n\n===Overarching Theories===\n\n[[File:Shiva Kosa from Champa.jpg|thumb|upright|right|This Cham head of [[Shiva]] was made of [[electrum]] around 800.

(Museum of Vietnamese History)]]\nModern scholarship has been guided by two competing theories in the historiography of Champa. Scholars agree that historically Champa was divided into several regions or principalities spread out from south to north along the coast of modern [[Vietnam]] and united by a common language, culture, and heritage. It is acknowledged that the historical record is not equally rich for each of the regions in every historical period. For example, in the 10th century AD, the record is richest for ''Indrapura''; in the 12th century AD, it is richest for [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]]; following the 15th century AD, it is richest for ''Panduranga''. Some scholars have taken these shifts in the historical record to reflect the movement of the Cham capital from one location to another. According to such scholars, if the 10th-century record is richest for Indrapura, it is so because at that time Indrapura was the capital of Champa. Other scholars have disputed this contention, holding that Champa was never a united country, and arguing that the presence of a particularly rich historical record for a given region in a given period is no basis for claiming that the region functioned as the capital of a united Champa during that period.<ref>Maspero, ''Le royaume de Champa'', represented the thesis that Champa was politically unified.

[[Sanskrit]] was adopted as a scholarly language, and [[Hinduism]], especially [[Shaivism]], became the state religion. From the 10th century AD onwards, Arab maritime trade in the region brought increasing Islamic cultural and religious influences. Champa came to serve as an important link in the [[spice trade]], which stretched from the [[Persian Gulf]] to [[South China]], and later in the [[Arab]] maritime routes in [[Mainland Southeast Asia]] as a supplier of [[aloe]]. Despite the frequent wars between Champa and [[Cambodia]], the two countries also traded and cultural influences moved in both directions. Royal families of the two countries intermarried frequently. Champa also had close trade and cultural relations with the powerful maritime empire of [[Srivijaya]] and later with the [[Majapahit]] of the [[Malay Archipelago]].\n\nEvidence gathered from linguistic studies around [[Aceh]] confirms that a very strong Champan cultural influence existed in Indonesia; this is indicated by the use of the [[Chamic languages|Chamic]] language [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]] as the main language in the coastal regions of Aceh.

The [[Hinduism]] of Champa was overwhelmingly [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] and it was liberally combined with elements of local religious cults such as the worship of the Earth goddess [[Lady Po Nagar]]. The main symbols of Cham Shaivism were the [[lingam]], the [[mukhalinga]], the ''ja\u1e6d\u0101li\u1e45gam'', the segmented ''[[Lingam|li\u1e45gam]]'', and the ''ko\u015ba''.{{sfn|Hubert|2012|p=31}}\n* A '''li\u1e45ga''' (or '''li\u1e45gam''') is black stone pillar that serves as a representation of Shiva.

The donation of a ko\u015ba to the decoration of a li\u1e45ga was a distinguishing characteristic of Cham Shaivism.

They speak [[Chamic languages]], a subfamily of [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] closely related to the [[Malayic languages|Malayic]] and [[Bali\u2013Sasak languages]].\n\nChampa was preceded in the region by a kingdom called [[L\u00e2m \u1ea4p]] (Vietnamese), or Linyi ({{lang|zh|\u6797\u9091}}, Lim Ip in [[Middle Chinese]]), that was in existence since AD 192; although the historical relationship between Linyi and Champa is not clear. Champa reached its apogee in the 9th and 10th centuries AD. Thereafter, it began a gradual decline under pressure from [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]], the Vietnamese polity centered in the region of modern [[Hanoi]]. In 1832, the Vietnamese emperor [[Minh M\u1ea1ng]] annexed the remaining Cham territories.\n\n[[Hinduism]], adopted through conflicts and conquest of territory from neighboring [[Funan]] in the 4th century AD, shaped the art and culture of the Champa kingdom for centuries, as testified by the many Cham [[Hindus|Hindu]] statues and red brick temples that dotted the landscape in Cham lands. [[M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n]], a former religious center, and [[H\u1ed9i An]], one of Champa's main port cities, are now [[World Heritage Site]]s. Today, many Cham people adhere to [[Islam]], a conversion which began in the 10th century, with the Royals having fully adopted the faith by the 17th century; they are called Bani Cham (from Arabic: [[Banu (Arabic)|Bani]]). There are, however, Balamon Cham (from [[Sanskrit]]: [[Brahman]]) who still retain and preserve their [[Hindus|Hindu]] faith, rituals, and festivals. The Balamon Cham are one of only two surviving non-[[Indian people|Indic]] indigenous [[Hindus|Hindu]] peoples in the world, with a culture dating back thousands of years.

(Museum of Vietnamese History)]]\nModern scholarship has been guided by two competing theories in the historiography of Champa. Scholars agree that historically Champa was divided into several regions or principalities spread out from south to north along the coast of modern [[Vietnam]] and united by a common language, culture, and heritage. It is acknowledged that the historical record is not equally rich for each of the regions in every historical period. For example, in the 10th century AD, the record is richest for ''Indrapura''; in the 12th century AD, it is richest for [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]]; following the 15th century AD, it is richest for ''Panduranga''. Some scholars have taken these shifts in the historical record to reflect the movement of the Cham capital from one location to another. According to such scholars, if the 10th-century record is richest for Indrapura, it is so because at that time Indrapura was the capital of Champa. Other scholars have disputed this contention, holding that Champa was never a united country, and arguing that the presence of a particularly rich historical record for a given region in a given period is no basis for claiming that the region functioned as the capital of a united Champa during that period.<ref>Maspero, ''Le royaume de Champa'', represented the thesis that Champa was politically unified.

[[L\u00e2m \u1ea4p]], a predecessor state in the region, began its existence in AD 192 as a breakaway Chinese colony. An official successfully revolted against Chinese rule in central Vietnam, and [[L\u00e2m \u1ea4p]] was founded in AD 192.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3U014Ik_cvAC&pg=PA20 |title=Vietnam in Pictures|author=Stacy Taus-Bolstad|year=2003|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|location=|page=20|isbn=0-8225-4678-7|pages=|accessdate=9 January 2011}}</ref> In the 4th century AD, wars with the neighbouring [[Kingdom of Funan]] in [[Cambodia]] and the acquisition of Funanese territory led to the infusion of [[Culture of India|Indian culture]] into Cham society. [[Sanskrit]] was adopted as a scholarly language, and [[Hinduism]], especially [[Shaivism]], became the state religion. From the 10th century AD onwards, Arab maritime trade in the region brought increasing Islamic cultural and religious influences. Champa came to serve as an important link in the [[spice trade]], which stretched from the [[Persian Gulf]] to [[South China]], and later in the [[Arab]] maritime routes in [[Mainland Southeast Asia]] as a supplier of [[aloe]]. Despite the frequent wars between Champa and [[Cambodia]], the two countries also traded and cultural influences moved in both directions. Royal families of the two countries intermarried frequently. Champa also had close trade and cultural relations with the powerful maritime empire of [[Srivijaya]] and later with the [[Majapahit]] of the [[Malay Archipelago]].\n\nEvidence gathered from linguistic studies around [[Aceh]] confirms that a very strong Champan cultural influence existed in Indonesia; this is indicated by the use of the [[Chamic languages|Chamic]] language [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]] as the main language in the coastal regions of Aceh. Linguists believe the Acehnese language, a descendant of the Proto-Chamic language, separated from the Chamicic tongue sometime in the 1st millennium AD.

Though Cham territory included the mountainous zones west of the coastal plain and (at times) extended into present-day [[Laos]], for the most part, the Cham remained a seafaring people dedicated to trade, and maintained few settlements of any size away from the coast.\n\nHistorical Champa consisted of up to five principalities:\n* '''[[Indrapura (Champa)|Indrapura]]''' (\"City of [[Indra]]\") was the capital of Champa from about AD 875 to about AD 1000. It was located at the site of the modern village of \u0110\u1ed3ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng, near the modern city of [[Da Nang]].

The associated port was at present-day [[Qui Nh\u01a1n]]. Important excavations have also been conducted at nearby Th\u00e1p M\u1eafm, which may have been a religious and cultural centre. Vijaya became the political and cultural centre of Champa around AD  1000, when the northern capital of Indrapura was abandoned due to pressure from the Viet. It remained the centre of Champa until AD  1471, when it was sacked by the Vi\u1ec7t and the centre of Champa was again displaced toward the south. In its time, the principality of Vijaya controlled much of present-day Quang-Nam, Quang-Ngai, B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh, and Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean Provinces.\n* '''[[Kauthara]]''' was located in the area of modern [[Nha Trang]] in [[Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a Province]]. Its religious and cultural centre was the temple of [[Po Nagar]], several towers of which still stand at Nha Trang.

The D\u1eeba lived in Amravati and Vijaya, while the Cau lived in Kauthara and Panduranga. The two clans differed in their customs and habits and conflicting interests led to many clashes and even war.

The entire region of [[Southeast Asia]], in fact, was home to numerous sophisticated Hindu kingdoms. From [[Khmer Empire|Angkor]] in neighbouring Cambodia, to [[Medang Kingdom|Java]] and [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]] in Indonesia.<ref name=\"Brannon\"/>\n[[File:Garuda Thap Mam 13th c.jpg|thumb|upright|13th century sculpture in the Th\u00e1p M\u1eafm style, depicting [[Garuda]] devouring a serpent.]]\nBefore the conquest of Champa by the \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t emperor Tr\u1ea7n Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng in 1471, the dominant religion of the Cham people was [[Hinduism]], and the culture was heavily influenced by that of [[India]]. The [[Hinduism]] of Champa was overwhelmingly [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] and it was liberally combined with elements of local religious cults such as the worship of the Earth goddess [[Lady Po Nagar]]. The main symbols of Cham Shaivism were the [[lingam]], the [[mukhalinga]], the ''ja\u1e6d\u0101li\u1e45gam'', the segmented ''[[Lingam|li\u1e45gam]]'', and the ''ko\u015ba''.{{sfn|Hubert|2012|p=31}}\n* A '''li\u1e45ga''' (or '''li\u1e45gam''') is black stone pillar that serves as a representation of Shiva. Cham kings frequently erected and dedicated stone lingas as the central religious images in royal temples. The name a Cham king would give to such a linga would be a composite of the king's own name and suffix \"-i\u015bvara\", which stands for Shiva.{{sfn|Ng\u00f4|2005|p=68ff}}\n* A '''mukhali\u1e45ga''' is a linga upon which has been painted or carved an image of Shiva as a human being or a human face.\n* A '''ja\u1e6d\u0101li\u1e45ga''' is a linga upon which has been engraved a stylised representation of Shiva's chignon hairstyle.\n* A '''segmented li\u1e45ga''' is a linga post divided into three sections to represent the three aspects of the [[Hindus|Hindu]] godhead or [[trimurti]]: the lowest section, square in shape, represents [[Brahma]]; the middle section, octagonal in shape, represents [[Vishnu]], and the top section, circular in shape, represents Shiva.\n* A '''ko\u015ba''' is a cylindrical basket of precious metal used to cover a linga. The donation of a ko\u015ba to the decoration of a li\u1e45ga was a distinguishing characteristic of Cham Shaivism. Cham kings gave names to special ko\u015bas in much the way that they gave names to the li\u1e45gas themselves.{{sfn|Ng\u00f4|2005|p=69}}\n\nThe predominance of [[Hinduism]] in Cham religion was interrupted for a time in the 9th and 10th centuries AD, when a dynasty at [[Indrapura (Champa)|Indrapura]] (modern \u0110\u1ed3ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng, [[Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province]], Vietnam) adopted [[Mahayana]] Buddhism as its faith. The [[Art of Champa|Buddhist art]] of \u0110\u1ed3ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng has received special acclaim for its originality.\n\nBeginning in the 10th century AD, [[Hinduism]] again became the predominant religion of Champa. Some of the sites that have yielded important works of religious art and architecture from this period are, aside from [[M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n]], Kh\u01b0\u01a1ng M\u1ef9, [[Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u]], Chanh Lo, and [[Art of Champa|Th\u00e1p M\u1eafm]].\n\n===Islam===\nIslam started making headway among the Cham after the 10th century AD. By the 17th century, the royal families of the Cham had converted to Islam. Most Cham are now evenly split between being followers of Islam and [[Hinduism]], with the majority of Vietnamese Cham being [[Hindus|Hindu]] while the majority of [[Khmer people|Cambodian]] Cham are Muslim, though significant minorities of Mahayana Buddhists continue to exist.\n\nIndonesian 15th century records indicate the influence of Princess Daravati, a Cham, converted to Islam,{{sfn|Masp\u00e9ro|2002|p=114}} and influenced her husband, Kertawijaya, Majapahit's seventh ruler to convert the [[Majapahit]] royal family to Islam. The Islamic tomb of ''Putri Champa'' (Princess of Champa) can be found in [[Trowulan]], [[East Java]], the site of the Majapahit imperial capital.{{sfn|Taylor|2007|p=72}} In the 15th to 17th century, Muslim Cham maintained a cordial relationship with the [[Aceh Sultanate]] through dynastic marriage. This sultanate was located on the northern tip of [[Sumatra]] and was an active promoter of the Islamic faith in the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian archipelago]].\n\n==Economy==\nIn  contrast to \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, Champa's economy was not based on agriculture. As seafaring people, the Cham were highly mobile and established a network of trade including not only the major ports at [[H\u1ed9i An]], [[Thi Nai|Th\u1ecb N\u1ea1i]] but also extending into the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|mountainous hinterland]].<ref>Hardy 2009, 110\u201311</ref> Maritime trade was facilitated by a network of wells that provided fresh water to Cham and foreign ships along the coast of Champa and the islands of [[Cham Islands|C\u00f9 Lao Ch\u00e0m]] and [[Ly Son, Vietnam|L\u00fd S\u01a1n]].<ref name=\"Hardy 2009, 111\">Hardy 2009, 111</ref> While Kenneth R.
