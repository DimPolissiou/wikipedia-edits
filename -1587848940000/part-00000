Afghanistan}}\nRape in [[Afghanistan]] is a crime which can be legally prosecuted, but in practice it is very rarely reported, because of the immense risks that women face if they report it. Rape victims in the country face a double risk of being subjected to violence: on one hand they can become victims of honour killings perpetrated by their families, and on the other hand they can be victimized by the laws of the country: they can be charged with adultery, a crime that can be [[punishable by death]]. Furthermore, they can be forced by their families to marry their rapist. In 2011, Afghanistan made international news in regard to the story of a woman who was raped by a man, jailed for adultery, gave birth to a child in jail, and was then subsequently pardoned by president [[Hamid Karzai]], and in the end married the man who raped her.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16179236 |title=Jailed Afghanistan rape victim Gulnaz is freed |work=BBC News |date=14 December 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/gulnaz-afghan-rape-afghanistan-adultery-karzai |title=Gulnaz: the Afghan woman forced to marry her rapist - Channel 4 News |publisher=Channel4.com |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref> In 2012, Afghanistan recorded 240 cases of honour killings and 160 cases of rape, but the number for both honour killings and rapes is estimated to be much higher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khaama.com/240-cases-of-honor-killing-recorded-in-afghanistan-aihrc-2177 |title=240 cases of honor killing recorded in Afghanistan |publisher=Khaama.com |accessdate=2013-12-03|date=9 June 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://latinbusinesstoday.com/2013/06/aihrc-400-rape-honor-killings-registered-in-afghanistan-in-2-years/ |title=AIHRC: 400 rape, honor killings registered in Afghanistan in 2 years |work=Latin Business Today |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214224858/http://latinbusinesstoday.com/2013/06/aihrc-400-rape-honor-killings-registered-in-afghanistan-in-2-years/|archivedate=2015}}</ref> In 2013, in eastern Ghazni, a man attacked a woman and attempted to rape her, and as a result the relatives of the woman killed both the woman and the man in an honour killing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khaama.com/honor-killing-afghan-man-and-woman-killed-in-ghazni-1254 |title=Honor killing: Afghan man and woman killed in Ghazni|publisher=Khaama.com |accessdate=2013-12-03|date=16 January 2013}}</ref> In Afghanistan, crimes such as adultery, rape and trafficking are often conflated with each other,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cimicweb.org/cmo/afg/Documents/Governance/CFC_AFG_Human_Trafficking_Jan2013.pdf |title=Executive Summary : Human Trafficking and Afghanistan |publisher=Cimicweb.org |accessdate=2013-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104055649/https://www.cimicweb.org/cmo/afg/Documents/Governance/CFC_AFG_Human_Trafficking_Jan2013.pdf |archive-date=4 January 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> and it is generally not acceptable for a woman and a man to be alone together (unless married or related), and if this happens the response can be very violent: an Afghan medical doctor and his female patient were attacked by an angry mob who threw stones at them after the two were discovered in his private examining room without a chaperon.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/world/asia/afghan-doctor-is-killed.html?_r=0|title=Mob Attacks Afghan Doctor and Female Patient|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2013-12-04|first=Rod|last=Nordland|date=13 June 2013}}</ref> Recently, the security forces have been also alleged to rape children in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/routine-child-rape-by-afghan-police/ |title=Routine Child Rape by Afghan Police |work=The American Conservative |date=10 July 2013 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref>\n\n===Algeria===\n{{Further|Hassi Messaoud mob attacks against women}}\nArticle 336 of the Penal Code stipulates that rape is a punishable offence, but does not give a definition of rape (which is left to the courts).

This test consists of a physical examination of women who report rape during which a doctor inserts two fingers in the woman's vagina to determine whether the woman is \"habituated to sex\". This examination has its origin in the country's British colonial-era laws dating back to 1872. This deters many women from reporting rape. More than 100 experts, including doctors, lawyers, police, and women's rights activists, signed a joint statement in 2013 asking for the test, which they called \"demeaning\", to be abolished, as it \"does not provide any evidence that is relevant to proving the offence.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/bangladesh-activists-urge-ban-on-rape-victim-finger-test-326175 |title=Bangladesh activists urge ban on rape victim 'finger test' |publisher=NDTV.com |date=4 February 2013 |access-date=2013-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/05/world/asia/rape-exam-india/index.html |title=Activists: Get rid of 'degrading' parts of India's sexual assault exam |publisher=CNN.com |access-date=2013-12-03 |date=6 February 2013}}</ref> On 12 April 2018 Bangladesh High Court banned the \"two-finger test\" on the ground that the tests have no scientific merit or evidential value.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/court/2018/04/12/high-court-bans-two-finger-tests-rape/|title=High Court bans 'two finger tests' for rape {{!}} Dhaka Tribune|website=www.dhakatribune.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-29|date=12 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2018/04/12/hc-bans-use-of-two-finger-test-bio-manual-test-during-examinations-of-rape-victims|title=HC bans use of 'two-finger test', 'bio-manual test' during examinations of rape victims|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBetween the years of 2010 and 2013, the United Nations Multi-country Study on Men and Violence asked men in rural and urban Bangladesh if they had forced a woman to have sex at any point in their lives. 14.1% of men in rural Bangladesh and 9.5% of men in urban Bangladesh said yes (10% averaged). 2.7% of men in rural Bangladesh and 0.5% (6/1252) in urban Bangladesh had raped in the past year.

In refusing this \"rehabilitating marriage\" to the perpetrator, she went against the traditional social norms of the time which dictated such a solution.

Tuerkheimer reviewed the literature on rape allegations, and reported on the problems surrounding credibility of rape victims, and how that relates to false rape accusations. She pointed to national survey data from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] that indicates 1 in every 5 women (and 1 in 71 men) will be raped during their lifetime at some point. Despite the prevalence of rape and the fact that false rape allegations are rare, Tuerkheimer reported that law enforcement officers often default to disbelief about an alleged rape. This documented prejudice leads to reduced investigation and criminal justice outcomes that are faulty compared to other crimes. Tuerkheimer says that women face \"credibility discounts\" at all stages of the justice system, including from police, jurors, judges and prosecutors. These credibility discounts are especially pronounced when the victim is acquainted with the accuser, and the vast majority of rapes fall into this category.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Deborah|first=Tuerkheimer|date=2017|title=Incredible Women: Sexual Violence and the Credibility Discount|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol166/iss1/1/|journal=University of Pennsylvania Law Review|language=en|volume=166|issue=1}}</ref> The [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] estimated from 2005-2007 that about 2% of victims who were raped while incapacitated (from drugs, alcohol or other reason) reported the rape to the police, compared to 13% of victims who experienced physically forced sexual assault.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf|title=U.S. Department of Justice: Campus Sex Assault (CSA) Study|last=|first=|date=December 2007|website=www.ncjrs.gov|access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe 1998 the National Violence Against Women Survey, based on a sample size of 8000, described the incidence of rape as 1 in 6 women and 1 in 33 men based upon the report of experiencing an attempted or completed rape in her or his lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/172837.pdf|title=Prevalence, Incidence, and Consequences of Violence Against Women: Findings of the National Violence Against Women Survey|date=November 1998|publisher=National Institute of Justice|accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref>\n\nA 1997 study on the non-institutionalized, non-military population by the U.S. [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], which defines rape as forced penetration by the offender,<ref>Bureau of Justice Statistics, [http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=317#terms_def Terms and Definitions]</ref> found that 91% of reported rape victims are female and 9% are male.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/SOO.PDF|title=Pages 5 and 8|publisher=Bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov|accessdate=2013-12-03|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305070553/http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/soo.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of rapes in the United States go unreported.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reporting of Sexual Violence Incidents|url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/rape-sexual-violence/pages/rape-notification.aspx|work=[[National Institute of Justice]]|accessdate=7 June 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"huffpost\">{{Cite newspaper|last1=Thomas|first1=Emily|title=Rape Is Grossly Underreported In The U.S., Study Finds|journal=Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/21/rape-study-report-america-us_n_4310765.html|accessdate=7 June 2016|date=21 November 2013}}</ref> According to the [[American Medical Association]] (1995), sexual violence, and rape in particular, is considered the most [[Under-reporting|under-reported]] violent crime.<ref>American Medical Association (1995) Sexual Assault in America.

The study found that 3.1% of undergraduate women reported experiencing an act that met the researchers' definition of rape or attempted rape during a 6\u20137-month academic year. However, of those found to have experienced completed rape, only 46.5% of the victims answered that they considered the incident to be a rape, while 48.8% did not and 4.7% were unsure. The study also found that 10.1% of college women experienced rape and 10.9% experienced attempted rape prior to entering college. Victimization of men was not considered as part of this study.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Bonnie|title=The Sexual Victimization of College Women|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/182369.pdf|publisher=The U.S. Department of Justice}}</ref>\n\nIn a different section of the report, the authors speculate about whether statistics during an academic year generalize to an entire college experience. For a full discussion, read more on page 10 of the report, stating that \"... the percentage of completed or attempted rape victimization among women in higher educational institutions might climb to between one-fifth and one-quarter\" and further acknowledging in the corresponding footnote, #18, that \"These projections are suggestive. To assess accurately the victimization risk for women throughout a college career, longitudinal research following a cohort of female students across time is needed.\"\n\n80,000 American children are sexually abused each year.

Sexually violent crimes targeting children involve forced sexual activities such as intercourse, masturbation, and/or other explicit contact with a minor. According to Child Protective Services, eighty percent of the time, a parent ends up being the perpetrator.

Afghanistan}}\nRape in [[Afghanistan]] is a crime which can be legally prosecuted, but in practice it is very rarely reported, because of the immense risks that women face if they report it. Rape victims in the country face a double risk of being subjected to violence: on one hand they can become victims of honour killings perpetrated by their families, and on the other hand they can be victimized by the laws of the country: they can be charged with adultery, a crime that can be [[punishable by death]]. Furthermore, they can be forced by their families to marry their rapist. In 2011, Afghanistan made international news in regard to the story of a woman who was raped by a man, jailed for adultery, gave birth to a child in jail, and was then subsequently pardoned by president [[Hamid Karzai]], and in the end married the man who raped her.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16179236 |title=Jailed Afghanistan rape victim Gulnaz is freed |work=BBC News |date=14 December 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/gulnaz-afghan-rape-afghanistan-adultery-karzai |title=Gulnaz: the Afghan woman forced to marry her rapist - Channel 4 News |publisher=Channel4.com |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}</ref> In 2012, Afghanistan recorded 240 cases of honour killings and 160 cases of rape, but the number for both honour killings and rapes is estimated to be much higher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khaama.com/240-cases-of-honor-killing-recorded-in-afghanistan-aihrc-2177 |title=240 cases of honor killing recorded in Afghanistan |publisher=Khaama.com |accessdate=2013-12-03|date=9 June 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://latinbusinesstoday.com/2013/06/aihrc-400-rape-honor-killings-registered-in-afghanistan-in-2-years/ |title=AIHRC: 400 rape, honor killings registered in Afghanistan in 2 years |work=Latin Business Today |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214224858/http://latinbusinesstoday.com/2013/06/aihrc-400-rape-honor-killings-registered-in-afghanistan-in-2-years/|archivedate=2015}}</ref> In 2013, in eastern Ghazni, a man attacked a woman and attempted to rape her, and as a result the relatives of the woman killed both the woman and the man in an honour killing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khaama.com/honor-killing-afghan-man-and-woman-killed-in-ghazni-1254 |title=Honor killing: Afghan man and woman killed in Ghazni|publisher=Khaama.com |accessdate=2013-12-03|date=16 January 2013}}</ref> In Afghanistan, crimes such as adultery, rape and trafficking are often conflated with each other,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cimicweb.org/cmo/afg/Documents/Governance/CFC_AFG_Human_Trafficking_Jan2013.pdf |title=Executive Summary : Human Trafficking and Afghanistan |publisher=Cimicweb.org |accessdate=2013-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104055649/https://www.cimicweb.org/cmo/afg/Documents/Governance/CFC_AFG_Human_Trafficking_Jan2013.pdf |archive-date=4 January 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> and it is generally not acceptable for a woman and a man to be alone together (unless married or related), and if this happens the response can be very violent: an Afghan medical doctor and his female patient were attacked by an angry mob who threw stones at them after the two were discovered in his private examining room without a chaperon.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/world/asia/afghan-doctor-is-killed.html?_r=0|title=Mob Attacks Afghan Doctor and Female Patient|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2013-12-04|first=Rod|last=Nordland|date=13 June 2013}}</ref> Recently, the security forces have been also alleged to rape children in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/routine-child-rape-by-afghan-police/ |title=Routine Child Rape by Afghan Police |work=The American Conservative |date=10 July 2013 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref>\n\n===Algeria===\n{{Further|Hassi Messaoud mob attacks against women}}\nArticle 336 of the Penal Code stipulates that rape is a punishable offence, but does not give a definition of rape (which is left to the courts).

This test consists of a physical examination of women who report rape during which a doctor inserts two fingers in the woman's vagina to determine whether the woman is \"habituated to sex\". This examination has its origin in the country's British colonial-era laws dating back to 1872. This deters many women from reporting rape. More than 100 experts, including doctors, lawyers, police, and women's rights activists, signed a joint statement in 2013 asking for the test, which they called \"demeaning\", to be abolished, as it \"does not provide any evidence that is relevant to proving the offence.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/bangladesh-activists-urge-ban-on-rape-victim-finger-test-326175 |title=Bangladesh activists urge ban on rape victim 'finger test' |publisher=NDTV.com |date=4 February 2013 |access-date=2013-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/05/world/asia/rape-exam-india/index.html |title=Activists: Get rid of 'degrading' parts of India's sexual assault exam |publisher=CNN.com |access-date=2013-12-03 |date=6 February 2013}}</ref> On 12 April 2018 Bangladesh High Court banned the \"two-finger test\" on the ground that the tests have no scientific merit or evidential value.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/court/2018/04/12/high-court-bans-two-finger-tests-rape/|title=High Court bans 'two finger tests' for rape {{!}} Dhaka Tribune|website=www.dhakatribune.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-29|date=12 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2018/04/12/hc-bans-use-of-two-finger-test-bio-manual-test-during-examinations-of-rape-victims|title=HC bans use of 'two-finger test', 'bio-manual test' during examinations of rape victims|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBetween the years of 2010 and 2013, the United Nations Multi-country Study on Men and Violence asked men in rural and urban Bangladesh if they had forced a woman to have sex at any point in their lives. 14.1% of men in rural Bangladesh and 9.5% of men in urban Bangladesh said yes (10% averaged). 2.7% of men in rural Bangladesh and 0.5% (6/1252) in urban Bangladesh had raped in the past year.

She pointed to national survey data from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] that indicates 1 in every 5 women (and 1 in 71 men) will be raped during their lifetime at some point. Despite the prevalence of rape and the fact that false rape allegations are rare, Tuerkheimer reported that law enforcement officers often default to disbelief about an alleged rape. This documented prejudice leads to reduced investigation and criminal justice outcomes that are faulty compared to other crimes. Tuerkheimer says that women face \"credibility discounts\" at all stages of the justice system, including from police, jurors, judges and prosecutors.

They asked several questions covering a wide range of behaviours. From this study, 15% of college women answered \"yes\" to questions about whether they experienced something that met the definition of rape. 12% of women answered \"yes\" to questions about whether they experienced something that met the definition of attempted rape. Moreover, depending on the region, 2-6% of the men interviewed admitted to rape. While the study focused on female victims and male perpetrators; it did not consider rape of men or rape in LGBT relationships.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Koss|first=M. P.|last2=Gidycz |first2=C.

The study found that 3.1% of undergraduate women reported experiencing an act that met the researchers' definition of rape or attempted rape during a 6\u20137-month academic year. However, of those found to have experienced completed rape, only 46.5% of the victims answered that they considered the incident to be a rape, while 48.8% did not and 4.7% were unsure. The study also found that 10.1% of college women experienced rape and 10.9% experienced attempted rape prior to entering college. Victimization of men was not considered as part of this study.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Bonnie|title=The Sexual Victimization of College Women|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/182369.pdf|publisher=The U.S. Department of Justice}}</ref>\n\nIn a different section of the report, the authors speculate about whether statistics during an academic year generalize to an entire college experience. For a full discussion, read more on page 10 of the report, stating that \"... the percentage of completed or attempted rape victimization among women in higher educational institutions might climb to between one-fifth and one-quarter\" and further acknowledging in the corresponding footnote, #18, that \"These projections are suggestive. To assess accurately the victimization risk for women throughout a college career, longitudinal research following a cohort of female students across time is needed.\"\n\n80,000 American children are sexually abused each year. But unreported cases are higher, due to the fear among children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/Facts_for_Families_Pages/Child_Sexual_Abuse_09.aspx |title=Child Sexual Abuse |publisher=Aacap.org |date=20 August 2013 |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref> Over ninety percent of the time, the perpetrator is someone familiar or close with the child. Sexually violent crimes targeting children involve forced sexual activities such as intercourse, masturbation, and/or other explicit contact with a minor. According to Child Protective Services, eighty percent of the time, a parent ends up being the perpetrator. Children who become victims of this crime often end up developing phobias, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as performing poorly in school.

Following completion of the airport by 1952, operations started in earnest on 20 April 1954 with a 1,500-meter runway. The initial route to Madrid was operated by Iberia flying a [[Douglas DC-3]] aircraft but after a few months Iberia handed the route to [[Aviaco]].\n\nDuring the 1970s, as traffic at the airport grew, a further development plan was initiated.

As a result, in November 1981 the airport had its first international flight to [[Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle Airport]].\n\nIn preparation for future air traffic demands, Aena published an airport development project.\n\nIn late May 2007, the Board of Aena awarded the construction of the \"Vehicle Parking Building, Construction and Technical Block of Vigo airport\" to [[Dragados]] SA for an amount of 38,266,145 euros and an execution period of 28 months.\n\nAfter meeting in the summer of 2008, it was decided to expand Vigo Airport's terminal.

The expansion is planned to add 11,200 square meters to the current terminal of 8,200 square meters and also involves the total refurbishment of the existing terminal building. The renovation and extension will raise the annual capacity of the airport to four million users.\n\nIn 2018, 1.129.689 passengers and 1.060 tonnes of goods passed through the airport.<ref>http://www.aena.es/es/corporativa/aeropuerto-vigo-vuelve-superar-millon-pasajeros-anuales-en---2018.html?p=1237548067436</ref>\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n{{Airport-dest-list\n<!-- -->\n|[[Air Europa]] | [[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport|Madrid]]\n<!-- -->\n|[[Binter Canarias]] | [[Gran Canaria Airport|Gran Canaria]], [[Tenerife North Airport|Tenerife\u2013North]]\n<!-- -->\n|[[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] | [[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport|Madrid]]\n<!-- -->\n|[[Iberia Express]] | '''Seasonal:''' [[Tenerife North Airport|Tenerife\u2013North]]\n<!-- -->\n|[[Iberia Regional]] | [[Bilbao Airport|Bilbao]], [[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport|Madrid]], [[Valencia Airport|Valencia]] <br> '''Seasonal:''' Alicante ,  [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle]] (ends 30 October 2020)\n<!-- -->\n|[[Vueling]] | [[Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport|Barcelona]]\n<!-- -->\n}}\n\n==Ground transportation==\n[[File:Aeroportodevigo.jpg|thumb|Inside the terminal]]\n[[File:Vigo airport transit map.jpg|thumb|Vigo airport transit map]]\nVigo Airport is connected to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[North Portugal]] by different transportation networks.
