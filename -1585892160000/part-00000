The modern concept began to be developed with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], which allowed the use of complex mechanics, and the subsequent introduction of electricity. This made it possible to power machines with small compact motors. In the early 20th century, the notion of a [[humanoid]] machine was developed. Today, one can envisage human-sized robots with the capacity for near-human thoughts and movement.\n\nThe first uses of modern robots were in factories as [[industrial robot]]s \u2013 simple fixed machines capable of manufacturing tasks which allowed production with less need for human assistance.

But the king flew into a rage when apparently the automation started to flirt with the ladies in attendance and threatened the automation with execution. So the craftsman cut the automation open and revealed the inner workings of the artificial man.

The plans for making such humanoid automations were stolen from the kingdom of Rome, a generic term for the Greco-Roman-Byzantine culture. According to the ''Lokapannatti'', the Yavanas (\"Greek-speakers\") used the automations to carry out trade and farming, but also captured and executed criminals. Roman automation makers who left the kingdom were pursued and killed by the automations.

Following a battle between with the fierce warrior automations, Asoka finds the long-lived engineer who had constructed the automations and is shown how to dismantle and control them. Thus emperor Asoka manages to command a large army of automated warriors.

He wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of [[neurons|brain cells]] could give rise to very complex [[behavior]]s - essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, named Elmer and Elsie, were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as \"tortoises\" due to their shape and slow rate of movement. The three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable of [[phototaxis]], by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nWalter stressed the importance of using purely [[wiktionary:analogue|analogue]] electronics to [[simulate]] brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as [[Alan Turing]] and [[John von Neumann]] were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of [[digital data|digital]] [[computation]].

The modern concept began to be developed with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], which allowed the use of complex mechanics, and the subsequent introduction of electricity. This made it possible to power machines with small compact motors. In the early 20th century, the notion of a [[humanoid]] machine was developed. Today, one can envisage human-sized robots with the capacity for near-human thoughts and movement.\n\nThe first uses of modern robots were in factories as [[industrial robot]]s \u2013 simple fixed machines capable of manufacturing tasks which allowed production with less need for human assistance.

So the craftsman cut the automation open and revealed the inner workings of the artificial man.

The plans for making such humanoid automations were stolen from the kingdom of Rome, a generic term for the Greco-Roman-Byzantine culture. According to the ''Lokapannatti'', the Yavanas (\"Greek-speakers\") used the automations to carry out trade and farming, but also captured and executed criminals. Roman automation makers who left the kingdom were pursued and killed by the automations.

Following a battle between with the fierce warrior automations, Asoka finds the long-lived engineer who had constructed the automations and is shown how to dismantle and control them.

At the end of the Vietnam War the first laser-guided bombs were deployed, which could find their target by following a laser beam that was pointed at the target. During the 1972 [[Operation Linebacker]] laser-guided bombs proofed effective, but still depended heavily on human operators. [[Fire-and-forget]] weapons were also first deployed in the closing Vietnam War, once launched no further attention or action was required from the operator.<ref name=\"Armin Krishnan 2016 20\"/>\n\nThe development of humanoid robots was advanced considerably by [[Japanese robotics]] scientists in the 1970s.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tQqVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA66 ''Robotics and Mechatronics: Proceedings of the 4th IFToMM International Symposium on Robotics and Mechatronics'', page 66]</ref> [[Waseda University]] initiated the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the world's first full-scale humanoid intelligent robot.<ref>http://www.humanoid.waseda.ac.jp/booklet/kato_2-j.html</ref> Its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors.
