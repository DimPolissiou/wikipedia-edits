A committee from New York purchased {{convert|17|acres|km2 sqmi}} in [[Knox County, Illinois|Knox County]] in 1835, and the first 25 settlers arrived in 1836. They built temporary cabins in Log City near current Lake Storey, just north of Galesburg, having decided that no log cabins were to be built inside the town limits.\n\nGalesburg was home to the first [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] society in Illinois, founded in 1837, and was a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knox.edu/x12131.xml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601171751/http://www.knox.edu/x12131.xml|deadurl=y|title=Underground Freedom Railroad Station|archivedate=June 1, 2010}}</ref> The city was the site of the fifth [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|Lincoln\u2013Douglas debate]], on a temporary speaker's platform attached to Knox College's \"Old Main\" building on October 7, 1858. Knox College continues to maintain and use Old Main to this day. An Underground Railroad Museum and Lincoln-Douglas Debate Museum were built in Knox College's Alumni Hall after it had finished renovations.\n\nGalesburg was the home of [[Mary Ann Bickerdyke|Mary Ann \"Mother\" Bickerdyke]], who provided hospital care for [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. After the war, Galesburg was the birthplace of poet, author, and historian [[Carl Sandburg]], poet and artist [[Dorothea Tanning]], and former [[Major League Baseball]] star [[Jim Sundberg]]. Sandburg's boyhood home is now operated by the [[Illinois Historic Preservation Agency]] as the [[Carl Sandburg State Historic Site]]. The site contains the cottage he was born in, a modern museum, the rock under which he and his wife Lilian are buried, and a performance venue.\n\nThroughout much of its history, Galesburg has been inextricably tied to the [[railroad]] industry. Local businessmen were major backers of the first railroad to connect Illinois' (then) two biggest cities\u2014[[Chicago]] and [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]]\u2014as well as a third leg initially terminating across the [[Mississippi River]] from [[Burlington, Iowa]], eventually connecting to it via bridge and thence onward to the Western frontier. The [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] (CB&Q) sited major rail sorting yards here, including the first to use [[hump yard|hump sorting]]. The CB&Q also built a major [[Galesburg station (Amtrak)#History|depot]] on South Seminary Street which was controversially torn down and replaced by a much smaller [[Galesburg station (Amtrak)|station]] in 1983. The yard is still used by the [[BNSF Railway]].\n\n[[File:BNSF Galesburg.jpg|left|thumb|275px|A BNSF train passes through central Galesburg near the site of the [[Galesburg Station (Santa Fe)|former Santa Fe depot]].]]\n\nIn the late 19th century, when the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] connected its service through to Chicago, it also laid track through Galesburg and built  [[Galesburg Station (Santa Fe)|its own railroad depot]]. This depot remained in operation until the construction of the [[Cameron Connector]] to the southwest of town<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thezephyr.com/archives/santafe.htm |title=Did Galesburg businessmen really need to pay to bring the Santa Fe Railway to Town? |date=June 20, 1996 |author=Rex Cherrington |newspaper=The Zephyr |accessdate=February 16, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717043939/http://www.thezephyr.com/archives/santafe.htm |archivedate=July 17, 2011}}</ref> enabled [[Amtrak]] to reroute the ''[[Southwest Chief]]'' onto the Mendota Subdivision and join the ''[[California Zephyr]]'' and ''[[Illinois Zephyr]]'' at the Burlington Northern depot. A series of mergers eventually united both lines under the ownership of [[BNSF Railway]], carrying an average of seven freight trains per hour between them. As of the closing of the [[Maytag]] plant in fall of 2004, BNSF is once again the largest private employer in Galesburg.\n\nIn addition, Galesburg was home to the pioneering [[Brass Era car|brass era]] automobile company [[Western Tool Works (automobile company)|Western]], which produced the Gale, named for the town.<ref>Clymer, Floyd.

A committee from New York purchased {{convert|17|acres|km2 sqmi}} in [[Knox County, Illinois|Knox County]] in 1835, and the first 25 settlers arrived in 1836. They built temporary cabins in Log City near current Lake Storey, just north of Galesburg, having decided that no log cabins were to be built inside the town limits.\n\nGalesburg was home to the first [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] society in Illinois, founded in 1837, and was a stop on the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knox.edu/x12131.xml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601171751/http://www.knox.edu/x12131.xml|deadurl=y|title=Underground Freedom Railroad Station|archivedate=June 1, 2010}}</ref> The city was the site of the fifth [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|Lincoln\u2013Douglas debate]], on a temporary speaker's platform attached to Knox College's \"Old Main\" building on October 7, 1858. Knox College continues to maintain and use Old Main to this day. An Underground Railroad Museum and Lincoln-Douglas Debate Museum were built in Knox College's Alumni Hall after it had finished renovations.\n\nGalesburg was the home of [[Mary Ann Bickerdyke|Mary Ann \"Mother\" Bickerdyke]], who provided hospital care for [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. After the war, Galesburg was the birthplace of poet, author, and historian [[Carl Sandburg]], poet and artist [[Dorothea Tanning]], and former [[Major League Baseball]] star [[Jim Sundberg]]. Sandburg's boyhood home is now operated by the [[Illinois Historic Preservation Agency]] as the [[Carl Sandburg State Historic Site]]. The site contains the cottage he was born in, a modern museum, the rock under which he and his wife Lilian are buried, and a performance venue.\n\nThroughout much of its history, Galesburg has been inextricably tied to the [[railroad]] industry. Local businessmen were major backers of the first railroad to connect Illinois' (then) two biggest cities\u2014[[Chicago]] and [[Quincy, Illinois|Quincy]]\u2014as well as a third leg initially terminating across the [[Mississippi River]] from [[Burlington, Iowa]], eventually connecting to it via bridge and thence onward to the Western frontier. The [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] (CB&Q) sited major rail sorting yards here, including the first to use [[hump yard|hump sorting]]. The CB&Q also built a major [[Galesburg station (Amtrak)#History|depot]] on South Seminary Street which was controversially torn down and replaced by a much smaller [[Galesburg station (Amtrak)|station]] in 1983. The yard is still used by the [[BNSF Railway]].\n\n[[File:BNSF Galesburg.jpg|left|thumb|275px|A BNSF train passes through central Galesburg near the site of the [[Galesburg Station (Santa Fe)|former Santa Fe depot]].]]\n\nIn the late 19th century, when the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] connected its service through to Chicago, it also laid track through Galesburg and built  [[Galesburg Station (Santa Fe)|its own railroad depot]]. This depot remained in operation until the construction of the [[Cameron Connector]] to the southwest of town<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thezephyr.com/archives/santafe.htm |title=Did Galesburg businessmen really need to pay to bring the Santa Fe Railway to Town? |date=June 20, 1996 |author=Rex Cherrington |newspaper=The Zephyr |accessdate=February 16, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717043939/http://www.thezephyr.com/archives/santafe.htm |archivedate=July 17, 2011}}</ref> enabled [[Amtrak]] to reroute the ''[[Southwest Chief]]'' onto the Mendota Subdivision and join the ''[[California Zephyr]]'' and ''[[Illinois Zephyr]]'' at the Burlington Northern depot. A series of mergers eventually united both lines under the ownership of [[BNSF Railway]], carrying an average of seven freight trains per hour between them. As of the closing of the [[Maytag]] plant in fall of 2004, BNSF is once again the largest private employer in Galesburg.\n\nIn addition, Galesburg was home to the pioneering [[Brass Era car|brass era]] automobile company [[Western Tool Works (automobile company)|Western]], which produced the Gale, named for the town.<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.51.</ref>\n\nGalesburg was home to [[minor league baseball]] from 1890\u20131914.. The [[Galesburg Pavers]] was the last name of the [[minor league baseball]] franchise based in [[Galesburg, Illinois]].
