As of the fall of 2019, the university enrollment was 15,460 students.<ref name = Enrollment /> Lamar University is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]].  The university is named for [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], the second president of the Republic of Texas.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Lamar University}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2019}}\nLouis R. Pietzsch founded a public junior college in Beaumont's South Park. Lamar University started on September 17, 1923 as South Park Junior College, operating on the unused third floor of the new [[South Park High School (Beaumont, Texas)|South Park High School]]. Pietzsch acted as the first president of the college. South Park Junior College became the first college in Texas to receive [[Texas Education Agency|Texas Department of Education]] approval during the first year of operation, and became fully accredited in 1925.\n\nIn 1932, the college administration, recognizing that the junior college was serving the region rather than just the community, renamed it as Lamar College. It was named for [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], the second president of the Republic of Texas, who arranged to set aside land in counties for public schools. A statue of him was installed in the quadrangle of the campus near the Setzer Student Center. In 1933, the college was moving toward independence from South Park High School when construction began on new facilities. By 1942, the college was completely independent of the South Park school district, and operations moved to the current campus.\n\nWith the end of [[World War II]], an influx of veterans boosted enrollment. The Lamar board of trustees asked the Texas Legislature to promote Lamar College to a four-year state college. The initial attempt in 1947, led in the Texas House of Representatives by [[Jack Brooks (American politician)|Jack Brooks]] and in the Texas Senate by [[W. R. Cousins, Jr. (politician)|W. R. Cousins, Jr.]], failed, but the following year the two sponsors again advanced the bill through both houses. On June 14, 1949, Governor [[Beauford Jester]] signed the bill creating Lamar State College of Technology.\n[[File:1949 signing of the Lamar College Bill..jpg|thumb|Rep. Jack Brooks is at far left. Governor Beauford Jester is seated. Sen W. R. Cousins, Jr is at far right. Austin, Texas.]]\n\nEnrollment continued to grow throughout the 1950s and 1960s, reaching 10,000 students. Graduate work was authorized in 1960, when master's degrees were offered in several fields.<ref name=\"tsha\">{{cite web | url = http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kcl02 | title = The Handbook of Texas Online \u2013 Lamar University | author = Ralph A.

In 1970, Lamar State College began offering its first doctoral program, the Doctor of Engineering. In 1971 the college's name was officially changed to Lamar University.<ref name=\"tsha\"/>\n\nA group of [[African American]] veterans of [[World War II]], barred from admission on the grounds of race and calling themselves the Negro Goodwill Council, protested to Governor [[Beauford H. Jester|Beauford Jester]] about the exclusion of blacks from Lamar State College. They attempted to block passage of the bill to change Lamar into a state-supported senior college, which resulted in John Gray, Lamar's president, creating a black branch of Lamar called Jefferson Junior College. It opened with evening classes at Charlton-Pollard High School. In 1952, James Briscoe, a graduate of Charlton-Pollard High School, applied to Lamar. His parents were laborers and members of the Beaumont chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]]. The admissions office notified him that on the basis of his transcript, he was qualified to enroll for the spring term of 1951. On January 29, when Briscoe went to register for classes, Lamar's acting president G. A. Wimberly explained that a mistake had been made and suggested he apply to TSUN, now named [[Texas Southern University]]. State law, he said, created Lamar for whites only. In the summer of 1955, Versie Jackson and Henry Cooper, Jr. became the lead plaintiffs of a class action lawsuit, Jackson v. McDonald, which sought to end Lamar's policy of racial segregation. [[Lamar John Ryan Cecil|Lamar Cecil]], federal judge, ruled on July 30, 1956, that Lamar's \u201cwhite youth\u201d only admissions policy was unconstitutional and that September, a total of twenty-six blacks were admitted to the college amid violent protests at the campus gates and throughout the region for a number of weeks until [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] arrived and the rule of law restored.<ref>Shabazz, Amilcar; Advancing Democracy: African Americans and the Struggle for Access and Equity in Higher Education in Texas, University of North Carolina Press, 2004, pp. 169\u2013180, {{ISBN|978-0-8078-5505-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Recent history ===\nIn 1975, the university merged with [[Lamar State College\u2013Port Arthur|Port Arthur College]] in [[Port Arthur, Texas]], creating Lamar University-Port Arthur. In 1983, state Senator [[Carl A. Parker]] sponsored a bill creating the Lamar University System. In 1986, Lamar University-Orange and Lamar University-Port Arthur were granted accreditation separate from the main campus. [[Lamar Institute of Technology]] was created in 1990 in Beaumont to provide technical, business, health, and industrial education through programs two years or fewer in length.\n\nIn 1995, the Lamar University System was incorporated into the [[Texas State University System]]. In the fall of 1998 the Lamar University faculty numbered 423 and student enrollment was 8,241. Total enrollment reached 15,000 students in Fall 2012.

Lamar has been a member of the [[Texas State University System]] since 1995. It was the flagship institution of the former [[Lamar University System]]. As of the fall of 2019, the university enrollment was 15,460 students.<ref name = Enrollment /> Lamar University is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]].  The university is named for [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], the second president of the Republic of Texas.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Lamar University}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2019}}\nLouis R. Pietzsch founded a public junior college in Beaumont's South Park. Lamar University started on September 17, 1923 as South Park Junior College, operating on the unused third floor of the new [[South Park High School (Beaumont, Texas)|South Park High School]]. Pietzsch acted as the first president of the college. South Park Junior College became the first college in Texas to receive [[Texas Education Agency|Texas Department of Education]] approval during the first year of operation, and became fully accredited in 1925.\n\nIn 1932, the college administration, recognizing that the junior college was serving the region rather than just the community, renamed it as Lamar College. It was named for [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], the second president of the Republic of Texas, who arranged to set aside land in counties for public schools. A statue of him was installed in the quadrangle of the campus near the Setzer Student Center. In 1933, the college was moving toward independence from South Park High School when construction began on new facilities. By 1942, the college was completely independent of the South Park school district, and operations moved to the current campus.\n\nWith the end of [[World War II]], an influx of veterans boosted enrollment. The Lamar board of trustees asked the Texas Legislature to promote Lamar College to a four-year state college. The initial attempt in 1947, led in the Texas House of Representatives by [[Jack Brooks (American politician)|Jack Brooks]] and in the Texas Senate by [[W. R. Cousins, Jr. (politician)|W. R. Cousins, Jr.]], failed, but the following year the two sponsors again advanced the bill through both houses. On June 14, 1949, Governor [[Beauford Jester]] signed the bill creating Lamar State College of Technology.\n[[File:1949 signing of the Lamar College Bill..jpg|thumb|Rep. Jack Brooks is at far left. Governor Beauford Jester is seated. Sen W. R. Cousins, Jr is at far right. Austin, Texas.]]\n\nEnrollment continued to grow throughout the 1950s and 1960s, reaching 10,000 students.

In 1970, Lamar State College began offering its first doctoral program, the Doctor of Engineering. In 1971 the college's name was officially changed to Lamar University.<ref name=\"tsha\"/>\n\nA group of [[African American]] veterans of [[World War II]], barred from admission on the grounds of race and calling themselves the Negro Goodwill Council, protested to Governor [[Beauford H. Jester|Beauford Jester]] about the exclusion of blacks from Lamar State College. They attempted to block passage of the bill to change Lamar into a state-supported senior college, which resulted in John Gray, Lamar's president, creating a black branch of Lamar called Jefferson Junior College. It opened with evening classes at Charlton-Pollard High School. In 1952, James Briscoe, a graduate of Charlton-Pollard High School, applied to Lamar. His parents were laborers and members of the Beaumont chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]]. The admissions office notified him that on the basis of his transcript, he was qualified to enroll for the spring term of 1951. On January 29, when Briscoe went to register for classes, Lamar's acting president G. A. Wimberly explained that a mistake had been made and suggested he apply to TSUN, now named [[Texas Southern University]]. State law, he said, created Lamar for whites only. In the summer of 1955, Versie Jackson and Henry Cooper, Jr. became the lead plaintiffs of a class action lawsuit, Jackson v. McDonald, which sought to end Lamar's policy of racial segregation. [[Lamar John Ryan Cecil|Lamar Cecil]], federal judge, ruled on July 30, 1956, that Lamar's \u201cwhite youth\u201d only admissions policy was unconstitutional and that September, a total of twenty-six blacks were admitted to the college amid violent protests at the campus gates and throughout the region for a number of weeks until [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] arrived and the rule of law restored.<ref>Shabazz, Amilcar; Advancing Democracy: African Americans and the Struggle for Access and Equity in Higher Education in Texas, University of North Carolina Press, 2004, pp. 169\u2013180, {{ISBN|978-0-8078-5505-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Recent history ===\nIn 1975, the university merged with [[Lamar State College\u2013Port Arthur|Port Arthur College]] in [[Port Arthur, Texas]], creating Lamar University-Port Arthur. In 1983, state Senator [[Carl A. Parker]] sponsored a bill creating the Lamar University System. In 1986, Lamar University-Orange and Lamar University-Port Arthur were granted accreditation separate from the main campus. [[Lamar Institute of Technology]] was created in 1990 in Beaumont to provide technical, business, health, and industrial education through programs two years or fewer in length.\n\nIn 1995, the Lamar University System was incorporated into the [[Texas State University System]]. In the fall of 1998 the Lamar University faculty numbered 423 and student enrollment was 8,241. Total enrollment reached 15,000 students in Fall 2012. In the late 1990s, Lamar began undertaking campus improvement projects.\n\nIn 2001, the University began replacing its 1960s-vintage residence halls with new [[apartment]]-style housing facilities, dubbed \"Cardinal Village.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beacardinal.lamar.edu/about-lu/amenities.html|title=Campus Dining Options|accessdate=17 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2005, the gym underwent extensive renovation and adjacent to it, a new recreational sports center was built.

According to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the Aryan Brotherhood makes up an extremely low percentage of the entire US prison population but is responsible for a disproportionately large number of prison murders.\n\nThe gang has focused on the economic activities typical of organized crime entities, particularly drug trafficking, extortion, inmate prostitution, and murder-for-hire. Organization of its whites-only membership varies from prison to prison but is generally hierarchical, headed by a twelve-man council topped by a three-man commission. The Aryan Brotherhood uses various terms, symbols, and images to identify themselves, including shamrocks, swastikas, and other symbols. To join, members may swear a [[Blood brother|blood oath]] or take a pledge; acceptance into the Aryan Brotherhood is aided by a prospect's willingness to kill another inmate.\n\n==History==\n\nMost prisons in the United States were racially segregated until the 1960s. As prisons began to desegregate, many inmates organized along racial lines.<ref name = SPLC/> The Aryan Brotherhood is believed to have been formed at [[San Quentin State Prison]],<ref name=\"ABC\"/> but it may have been inspired by the [[Bluebird Gang]].<ref name = ABC/> They decided to strike against the blacks who were forming their own militant group called the [[Black Guerrilla Family]].<ref name=grann>David Grann.

It was believed that Silverstein and Fountain strangled Chappelle in his cell. They later contacted Geri Riley to let her know it was done. Silverstein and Fountain later killed Raymond Smith, a friend of Robert Chappelle. The two men stabbed Smith 67 times. Silverstein then started to plan killing a correctional officer. On October 22, 1983, gang members from the Aryan Brotherhood killed two correction officers at Marion. Silverstein killed an officer named Merle Clutts, stabbing him approximately 40 times. Several hours later, Fountain also killed an officer named Robert Hoffman. The tactics used were developed for a prior inmate murder; Silverstein used an improvised knife and handcuff key while being taken to the showers. He picked the lock, then attacked and killed Merle Clutts. Fountain used similar tactics to kill Robert Hoffman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/10/23/marion_prison_lockdown_thomas_silverstein_how_a_1983_murder_created_america.html|title = How a 1983 Murder Created America's Terrible Supermax-Prison Culture|publisher= Justin Peters| accessdate = February 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s, the Aryan Brotherhood had shifted its focus away from killing for strictly racial reasons and focused on organized crime such as drug trafficking, prostitution, and sanctioned murders.<ref name=grann/> They took on organized crime-level power inside of the prison system, and they hold more power than the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian crime families]] within the prison system.<ref name=grann/> For example, [[Gambino crime family]] boss [[John Gotti]] was assaulted while incarcerated in Marion Federal Penitentiary in 1996, and he allegedly asked the Aryan Brotherhood to murder his attacker.

After some of its leaders were sent to federal prisons, they took the opportunity to start organizing inside the federal prison system. This ended with the creation of two separate, but related organizations, the California Aryan Brotherhood, and the federal prison Aryan Brotherhood. As a former top leader said, \"They\u2019re like two related but different crime families. They each have their [ruling] commission\u2026 but they\u2019re allies.\"  By the late 1970s, these gangs had fewer than 100 members, but their membership grew rapidly as they absorbed other racist and skinhead groups, and today these gangs are estimated to have over 20,000 members in both the federal and state prison systems.<ref name=splc-groupdef />\n\nIn its early days, the group had a one-man, one-vote system, but this broke down as a result of the group's rapid expansion, and it  was replaced by the establishment of a hierarchical structure, headed by a 12-man council, and overseen by a three-member commission. The federal and state systems each had their own council and commission.<ref name=splc-groupdef /> Organization varies somewhat, from prison to prison. For example, in the Arizona prison system, members are known as \"kindred\" and organize into \"families.\" A \"council\" controls the families.

According to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the Aryan Brotherhood makes up an extremely low percentage of the entire US prison population but is responsible for a disproportionately large number of prison murders.\n\nThe gang has focused on the economic activities typical of organized crime entities, particularly drug trafficking, extortion, inmate prostitution, and murder-for-hire. Organization of its whites-only membership varies from prison to prison but is generally hierarchical, headed by a twelve-man council topped by a three-man commission. The Aryan Brotherhood uses various terms, symbols, and images to identify themselves, including shamrocks, swastikas, and other symbols. To join, members may swear a [[Blood brother|blood oath]] or take a pledge; acceptance into the Aryan Brotherhood is aided by a prospect's willingness to kill another inmate.\n\n==History==\n\nMost prisons in the United States were racially segregated until the 1960s. As prisons began to desegregate, many inmates organized along racial lines.<ref name = SPLC/> The Aryan Brotherhood is believed to have been formed at [[San Quentin State Prison]],<ref name=\"ABC\"/> but it may have been inspired by the [[Bluebird Gang]].<ref name = ABC/> They decided to strike against the blacks who were forming their own militant group called the [[Black Guerrilla Family]].<ref name=grann>David Grann.

It was believed that Silverstein and Fountain strangled Chappelle in his cell. They later contacted Geri Riley to let her know it was done. Silverstein and Fountain later killed Raymond Smith, a friend of Robert Chappelle. The two men stabbed Smith 67 times. Silverstein then started to plan killing a correctional officer. On October 22, 1983, gang members from the Aryan Brotherhood killed two correction officers at Marion. Silverstein killed an officer named Merle Clutts, stabbing him approximately 40 times. Several hours later, Fountain also killed an officer named Robert Hoffman. The tactics used were developed for a prior inmate murder; Silverstein used an improvised knife and handcuff key while being taken to the showers. He picked the lock, then attacked and killed Merle Clutts. Fountain used similar tactics to kill Robert Hoffman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/crime/2013/10/23/marion_prison_lockdown_thomas_silverstein_how_a_1983_murder_created_america.html|title = How a 1983 Murder Created America's Terrible Supermax-Prison Culture|publisher= Justin Peters| accessdate = February 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1990s, the Aryan Brotherhood had shifted its focus away from killing for strictly racial reasons and focused on organized crime such as drug trafficking, prostitution, and sanctioned murders.<ref name=grann/> They took on organized crime-level power inside of the prison system, and they hold more power than the [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian crime families]] within the prison system.<ref name=grann/> For example, [[Gambino crime family]] boss [[John Gotti]] was assaulted while incarcerated in Marion Federal Penitentiary in 1996, and he allegedly asked the Aryan Brotherhood to murder his attacker.

After some of its leaders were sent to federal prisons, they took the opportunity to start organizing inside the federal prison system. This ended with the creation of two separate, but related organizations, the California Aryan Brotherhood, and the federal prison Aryan Brotherhood. As a former top leader said, \"They\u2019re like two related but different crime families. They each have their [ruling] commission\u2026 but they\u2019re allies.\"  By the late 1970s, these gangs had fewer than 100 members, but their membership grew rapidly as they absorbed other racist and skinhead groups, and today these gangs are estimated to have over 20,000 members in both the federal and state prison systems.<ref name=splc-groupdef />\n\nIn its early days, the group had a one-man, one-vote system, but this broke down as a result of the group's rapid expansion, and it  was replaced by the establishment of a hierarchical structure, headed by a 12-man council, and overseen by a three-member commission. The federal and state systems each had their own council and commission.<ref name=splc-groupdef /> Organization varies somewhat, from prison to prison. For example, in the Arizona prison system, members are known as \"kindred\" and organize into \"families.\" A \"council\" controls the families.

Thirteen years later, the school became a \u201ccomprehensive university\u201d and changed its name to Konkuk (\u5efa\u570b), which means \u201cfounding a nation.\u201d As strong believers in the role of higher education in maintaining Korea's sovereignty, the founder and his supporters chose the name in the hopes that Konkuk graduates would build and serve the nation. As of 2016, Konkuk University has two campuses \u2013 the main campus in central Seoul and the Glocal campus in Chungju \u2014 with approximately 29,000 students enrolled.\n\nDr. Yoo, whose pen name was Sanghuh, was raised by a father who moved to [[Manchuria]] to join the Korean Independence Movement. Trained as a medical doctor during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]], Dr. Yoo initially had opened the People's Hospital in 1931 to provide medical care to less fortunate Koreans. Before long, he turned his attention to young leaders in rural areas since agriculture was the main pillar of the economy. Dr. Yoo and his supporters, who would later become benefactors of Konkuk University, aimed to open a higher education institution for leaders who would enlighten the rural population. Opposed by the Japanese, the reform-minded group managed a private organization and developed their ideas for a little more than a decade.\n\nWith years of experience in rural reforms and education as well as a short stint as a politician, Dr. Yoo became convinced that Konkuk University's must set its goals beyond academic excellence. During his tenure as the president of Konkuk University and the chairman of the Konkuk University Foundation, he emphasized three virtues\u2014sincerity, fidelity, and righteousness\u2014which continues to guide Konkuk to this day.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Yoo was aware that the limited space would not be sufficient to provide future agricultural leaders with ample hands-on experience. Despite the severe financial difficulties and skepticism after the Korean War, he boldly executed a move to the current location in Seoul. Thanks to Dr. Yoo's generous endowment and education philosophy, Konkuk University not only leads in agricultural and life science research, but also excels in many other areas today. Furthermore, Konkuk University has undergone major transformations in the past decade, earning the title of \u201cthe fastest growing university in Korea.\u201d<ref name=\"Konkuk University \u2013 History\">{{cite web |url= http://www.konkuk.ac.kr/eng/jsp/About/about_1_1.jsp.jsp |title=Konkuk University \u2013 History|publisher=|accessdate=February 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Konkuk University celebrated its 70th anniversary.

Konkuk students will be able to choose from a variety of options, including the 2+One-Semester On-The-Job Training program, 3+1 Employment program, 7+1 Self-Designed Semester program, and 4+1 Bachelor's and master's degree program. The 2+One-Semester program allows students to gain work experience during the semester and take classes to fulfill course requirements for their majors during the vacation. For the 7+1 program, students will design their plans for external activities prior to the beginning of the semester. The activities are to develop expertise in areas of interest rather than being limited to opening a new business or finding employment. Once the plans are approved, students receive up to 15 credits once they submit completion reports.

Thirteen years later, the school became a \u201ccomprehensive university\u201d and changed its name to Konkuk (\u5efa\u570b), which means \u201cfounding a nation.\u201d As strong believers in the role of higher education in maintaining Korea's sovereignty, the founder and his supporters chose the name in the hopes that Konkuk graduates would build and serve the nation. As of 2016, Konkuk University has two campuses \u2013 the main campus in central Seoul and the Glocal campus in Chungju \u2014 with approximately 29,000 students enrolled.\n\nDr. Yoo, whose pen name was Sanghuh, was raised by a father who moved to [[Manchuria]] to join the Korean Independence Movement. Trained as a medical doctor during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]], Dr. Yoo initially had opened the People's Hospital in 1931 to provide medical care to less fortunate Koreans. Before long, he turned his attention to young leaders in rural areas since agriculture was the main pillar of the economy. Dr. Yoo and his supporters, who would later become benefactors of Konkuk University, aimed to open a higher education institution for leaders who would enlighten the rural population. Opposed by the Japanese, the reform-minded group managed a private organization and developed their ideas for a little more than a decade.\n\nWith years of experience in rural reforms and education as well as a short stint as a politician, Dr. Yoo became convinced that Konkuk University's must set its goals beyond academic excellence. During his tenure as the president of Konkuk University and the chairman of the Konkuk University Foundation, he emphasized three virtues\u2014sincerity, fidelity, and righteousness\u2014which continues to guide Konkuk to this day.\n\nIn addition, Dr. Yoo was aware that the limited space would not be sufficient to provide future agricultural leaders with ample hands-on experience. Despite the severe financial difficulties and skepticism after the Korean War, he boldly executed a move to the current location in Seoul. Thanks to Dr. Yoo's generous endowment and education philosophy, Konkuk University not only leads in agricultural and life science research, but also excels in many other areas today. Furthermore, Konkuk University has undergone major transformations in the past decade, earning the title of \u201cthe fastest growing university in Korea.\u201d<ref name=\"Konkuk University \u2013 History\">{{cite web |url= http://www.konkuk.ac.kr/eng/jsp/About/about_1_1.jsp.jsp |title=Konkuk University \u2013 History|publisher=|accessdate=February 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Konkuk University celebrated its 70th anniversary.

Higher education institutions receive incentives for restructuring and training students to meet the society's needs under the project. Of the 75 universities that applied, Konkuk University, Ewha Womans University, and Hanyang University's ERICA campus and 18 other universities were chosen. As a result, Konkuk University is expected to receive up to 450 billion won in government funding over three years until 2018. More than 15% will be allocated for scholarships, and a significant portion will be used to improve educational programs and build infrastructure.[[File:Dutch Students.jpg|thumb|Dutch Students participated the Living Lab Project]]<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |title=KU Chosen for the PRIME Project by the National Government |url=http://www.konkuk.ac.kr/Administration/Abroad/newsletter/june2016/news04.jsp |date= |accessdate=October 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n;Konkuk Institute of Technology\nIn 2017, Konkuk University introduced the \"Konkuk Institute of Technology\" to train and prepare students for industries with significant growth potential. The institute includes eight departments in energy engineering, smart vehicle engineering, smart ICT engineering, cosmetics engineering, stem cell and regenerative biology, systems biotechnology, integrative bioscience and biotechnology, and biomedical science and engineering with 333 students. Konkuk University plans to offer a 5-year BS/MS program, through which all students will receive a scholarship for their graduate education as well as a stipend of 300,000 won per month for book purchases and research, at the institute.

The innovative system is part of an effort to make university education more student-focused and tailored to meet changing industry demands. Konkuk students will be able to choose from a variety of options, including the 2+One-Semester On-The-Job Training program, 3+1 Employment program, 7+1 Self-Designed Semester program, and 4+1 Bachelor's and master's degree program. The 2+One-Semester program allows students to gain work experience during the semester and take classes to fulfill course requirements for their majors during the vacation. For the 7+1 program, students will design their plans for external activities prior to the beginning of the semester. The activities are to develop expertise in areas of interest rather than being limited to opening a new business or finding employment. Once the plans are approved, students receive up to 15 credits once they submit completion reports. The Center for Integrated Science and Technology, which will include four departments in biotechnology and another four in engineering, will offer the 4+1 Bachelor's and master's degree program.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"Plus Semester\" System Introduced at KU |url=http://www.konkuk.ac.kr/Administration/Abroad/newsletter/june2016/news02.jsp |date= |accessdate=October 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Q68859 Konkuk University A01.jpg|thumb|Konkuk University Station]]\nThe Seoul campus is adjacent to the [[Konkuk University Station]], which is serviced by [[Seoul Subway Line 2]] and [[Seoul Subway Line 7|Line 7]].

It is part of the [[Ottumwa Community School District]], and it is the district's only high school.  It was established in 1923.  The school sports [[mascot]] is a Bulldog.\n\n== History ==\n\nFor several years, students in Ottumwa attended private classes inside area homes.  Later, some students studied inside a local [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist Episcopal]] [[church (building)|church]].  In 1865, the first public school in Ottumwa&mdash;Adams School&mdash;was completed at \"College Square\", an area bounded by College, Fourth, Second, and Union Streets.  The school, which utilized four classrooms on its top floor for the high school, cost $28,818.57<ref name=\"cost\">Meagher, G.; Munsell, H. ''Ottumwa, Yesterday and Today''. p. 49 and 51.</ref> to build, and it sat on the same site as the present-day high school. It was declared unsafe in 1883.  The school board voted to tear down the condemned building and build a new one at the same site.  With more citizens coming to Ottumwa, an additional high school was constructed about a mile west of the Adams School site in 1899.  This building later served as a [[middle school|junior high school]] until it was closed in 1982.\n\n=== Schaefer Stadium ===\nThe Ottumwa High School football/track stadium, known as Schaefer Stadium, was established in the early 1920s in memory of a past student of OHS. Walter B. Schaefer graduated from the Ottumwa High School in 1903 with amazing athletic records and many college football opportunities. He went to the University of Chicago to play football under the famous coaching of Amos Alonzo Stagg, but Schaefer left college early to fight in the war. Schaefer was killed while serving in 1918. He was considered one of the greatest athletes in Iowa and especially in football, which is why the Ottumwa Stadium is now known as Schaefer Stadium. In 2018, Schaefer Stadium was updated. New bleachers for the home side and a new visitor exit were added.\n\n=== Current Building ===\n[[File:Ottumwa High School old.png|left|thumb|This building served as Ottumwa High School from 1899 to 1923.]]\nTo address the growing student population, the Ottumwa Community School District began construction on the current high school building at the same location as the Adams School in 1921.  The \"new\" high school was designed by architects [[Croft & Boerner]] of Minneapolis.  It was completed in 1923.  As part of the construction, the Adams School was lifted from its foundation and moved east&mdash;it would serve as a building for vocational classes at the new high school.\n\nOttumwa High School as it stands today opened on August 29, 1923 to grades 9, 10, 11, and 12.  It reportedly cost just over one [[million]] [[dollar]]s to complete.<ref name=\"cost\" />\n\nIn the 1970s, an additional building was completed&mdash;the \"Vo-Tech\" building&mdash;for [[vocational education|vocational]] and [[performing arts]] classes.  The facility was connected to the main building via a [[skywalk]] accessible from the second floor hallway.  This decade also saw the addition of a second [[gym]]nasium, often nicknamed the \"Rubber Gym\" because of its rubber floor, which was built behind the first gymnasium and replaced the Adams School, which was demolished.\n\n=== Building Expansions ===\nIn the 1990s, a city [[property tax]] was levied to help fund a multi-million dollar renovation project.  The original aim of the project was to renovate the school hallways and some classrooms, add additional basement classrooms, relocate the cafeteria and library to a new area adjacent to the original building and connecting to the Vo-Tech building, renovate and modernize the school's gymnasium facilities ([[locker room|locker]] and [[exercise]] rooms), and remodel the school's [[auditorium]].  The project went over budget, and the gymnasium and auditorium phases were scratched.  The cafeteria and library projects were successfully completed, along with the basement, classroom, and hallway renovations, by the end of the century.  The skywalk formerly connecting the Vo-Tech and main buildings was replaced by the new building.\n\n=== Vision Iowa Grant Renovation ===\nIn spring 2001, the school received a [[Grant (money)|grant]] for nearly $1 million from Vision Iowa to remodel the auditorium which is where they now hold all of their pep rallies, guest speakers, and drama productions.<ref name=\"aud\">''Ottumwa Courier'' (2001), [http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10366638&BRD=2575&PAG=461&dept_id=513091&rfi=8 Ottumwa to receive nearly $1 million for OHS improvements].</ref>  During this renovation some plaster designs were removed from the original 1921-1923 ceiling and placed glass for viewing new the exits. The auditorium was closed from 2002 to 2003 for renovations.  Its grand re-opening took place on November 23, 2003.<ref name=\"aud2\">''Ottumwa Courier'' (November 24, 2002), [http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10356927&BRD=2575&PAG=461&dept_id=513091&rfi=8 Hundreds pack new auditorium].</ref> At the same time, additional renovations to the gymnasium facilities were completed with aid of a federal grant obtained with the help of [[Iowa]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Tom Harkin]].\n\n== Campus ==\n[[File:Iowa Ottumwa High School looking west.jpg|right|thumb|OHS is situated on one of the highest hills in [[Ottumwa, Iowa|Ottumwa]].

Legend suggests he originally called the area \"Ottumwa\" from this spot in 1838.\n\nThe four floors of the main building can be roughly divided by subject areas: the rooms on the bottom floor contain mostly [[social studies]] and [[foreign language]] classrooms; the second floor contains several [[office]]s, [[family and consumer science]] classrooms, and [[mathematics]] classrooms; the third floor is mostly mathematics and [[language arts]] classrooms; and the fourth floor houses [[science]] and language arts classrooms.  The school's auditorium and gymnasium are usually accessed from the second floor, though the auditorium and gyms have entrances on the third floor as well.\n\nThe Vo-Tech building houses vocational classrooms, a [[Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps|JROTC]] room, and a [[Optical fiber|fiber optics network]] room on its first floor.  Performing arts classrooms are located on its second floor.\n\nThe two buildings are connected by a central [[cafeteria]] or commons; this building also houses a second-floor [[library]] with approximately 9,000 volumes.\n\nOttumwa High School does not hold any sporting contests on its campus; instead, the school uses other buildings, public facilities, or the stadium within Ottumwa. The school does maintain a [[parking lot]] for students, and three for faculty.\n\n== Faculty Awards ==\nMr. Hanson, the current principal of OHS, was awarded the \"2015 Iowa Secondary Principal of the Year.\" on May 11, 2015 at a school wide assembly at Ottumwa High School.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ottumwa Leader is Iowa Secondary Principal of the Year|url=http://www.sai-iowa.org/news.cfm/Article/News/Ottumwa-Leader-is-Iowa-Secondary-Principal-of-the-Year/2015-3-11|website=SAI|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref> \n\nIn 2001, anatomy/physiology teacher Gail Wortmann was named \"Iowa Teacher of the Year.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Iowa Teacher of the Year|url=https://www.educateiowa.gov/pk-12/award-exchange-programs/iowa-teacher-year-toy|website=Education Iowa|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref> She was also awarded the Milken Family Foundation Teacher of the Year award in that year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Milken Educator Awards|url=http://www.milkeneducatorawards.org/|website=Milken Educator Awards|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2000\u20132002, science teacher Peggy Steffen served as an Einstein Fellow for [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/nasa-einstein-fellows.html|website=NASA Einstein Fellows|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Extracurricular activities ==\n\nStudents at Ottumwa High School can participate in many extracurricular activities.  In addition to 14 varsity athletic teams ([[archery]], [[baseball]]/[[softball]], [[basketball]], [[bowling]], [[cheerleading]], [[cross-country running]], [[American football|football]], [[golf]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[tennis]], [[track and field]], [[volleyball]], [[soccer]], [[Trap shooting|trapshoot]], dance, and [[scholastic wrestling|wrestling]]), OHS offers numerous clubs and other activities such as the [[JROTC]] program and [[Drama]].  The OHS [[Drama]] department presents several productions annually, and the [[band (music)|band]], [[choir]]s, and [[orchestra]] present several concerts. There is also a jazz band, which received its first first place ribbon in 2019 at a competition in Quincy, Illinois. There is a [[show choir]] - Sudden Impact - that competes in many competitions. Finally, there is a morning symphony which is a composed of both band and orchestra performers.\n\nAn [[Art]] Club, [[Debate]] Team, [[Public speaking|Speech]] Team, International Club, [[Best Buddies International|Best Buddies]], Fellowship of the Rainbow, and [[Science]] Club are joined by local chapters of [[Distributive Education Club of America|DECA]], Family Career an Community Leaders, Future Educators of America, Human Rights Youth, [[Students Against Destructive Decisions|SADD]], and the [[National Honor Society]] (known at OHS as the \"Torch Club\") to extend opportunities for students. In addition, there is a Silver Cord program, which is an opportunity for students to be recognized for 200 hours of community service that they have completed during their four years of high school. There is also a [[students' union|student council]] with approximately 50 members, who run concession stands and plan [[Homecoming (tradition)|homecoming]] (an annual tradition since 1938), Halloween/Christmas Events, intramural sports ([[basketball]], [[dodgeball]], powder puff [[American football|football]], and [[volleyball]]), and multiple \"Spirit Weeks.\" Furthermore, the Student Council help set up shirt and ticket sales, as well as design T-shirts and decorate Shaefer stadium.\n\nAnnual [[intramural sports]] include basketball, volleyball, trivia, cornhole and dodgeball tournaments. Organized by Student Council, OHS students put together their own team and team name to compete.\n\nAdditionally, there is an out of school program known as First Tech Challenge. In this program, students learn about the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) through hands-on learning in the field of robotics. Through the FTC program, robotics team members build and program robots. These robots then compete at the FTC Iowa State Tournament with the potential for qualifying for the World Championship Competition.\n\nStudents may also take a year-long course to help produce the \"Argus Annual\", an annual [[yearbook]] since 1904, the [[student newspaper]] (formerly the \"Argus News\", but is now the \"Bulldog Bulletin\"), or the student television show (\"BNN\"\u2014Standing for \"Bulldogs News Network\").  A student-run [[caf\u00e9]]&mdash;with gourmet food cooked by family and consumer science students&mdash;offers bi-weekly meals to the community.  Another class offers students interested in going directly into a field of work after [[graduation]] job shadowing experience.\n\nStudent traditions are observed around the week of homecoming, which is usually close to the end of September or early October.  Students celebrate the school day with \"dress-up days\", (such as \"[[duct tape]] day\", \"pink day\", \"black day\", \"Disney day\", \"Make-your-own t-shirt day\", and \"hat day\"), a [[parade]], a [[bonfire]]/local band [[concert]], and a football game.\n\n== Drama and Debate ==\nThe OHS Auditorium was renovated in 2000. \"Rumors\" was the first play performed in the newly renovated auditorium, and \"The Music Man\" was the first musical in 2003.  It was the first musical performed by the OHS drama department in fifteen years. The OHS Drama Department puts on two full-length shows per year, one in the fall and one in the spring.  A musical is performed every other year.  The Drama Department participates in speech contest during the winter months, competing in areas such as One Act, Ensemble Acting, Musical Theatre, Mime, Reader's Theater, TV News, Radio News, and individual events such as Poetry, Prose, Acting, Improv, and Public Address.\n\n=== Thespian Troupe #615 ===\nThe [[International Thespian Society]] of Ottumwa High School is Chapter #615.  It is one of the oldest Thespian troupes in the state of Iowa.  A Thespian Troupe is a National Honors Society for people who have invested over a hundred hours in two different productions with at least ten of those hours being crew hours.  After they have done so they become a Thespian and a part of the Thespian Troupe in their area. Former teacher Natalie Dommer was inducted into the Iowa Thespian Hall of Fame for the class of 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.schooltheatre.org/blogs/ginny-butsch/2018/06/12/community-spotlight-natalie-dommer,%20https://www.schooltheatre.org/blogs/ginny-butsch/2018/06/12/community-spotlight-natalie-dommer|title=Community Spotlight: Natalie Dommer|website=www.schooltheatre.org|language=en|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Speech Competitions ===\nOttumwa High School regularly participates in speech contest at the State and All-State levels.  This is a high honor for the students participating.  Students regularly attend the State and International Thespian Festivals each year, sometimes taking individual events (like the ones performed at speech contest) and performing them for fellow Thespians of Iowa, or even of foreign countries at the International festival. There are two aspects of speech competition:   large group and individual.\n\nThe Drama Department participates in the Iowa High School Speech Association speech events in mid November to the end of February, competing in areas such as One Act, Ensemble Acting, Musical Theatre, Mime, Reader's Theater, TV News, Radio News, and individual events such as Poetry, Prose, Acting, Improv, and Public Address.\n\n=== Debate ===\nThe OHS debate team has been helping students since 1914 in teaching responsibility, research skills, and different communicative skills.

Students are determined to be proficient if they score at or above the 41st National Percentile Rank in the subject area.\n* At the college level, students must meet any assessment requirements of the postsecondary institution including any placement exam requirements of the institution.\n\n==== Post Secondary Enrollment Options (PSEO) ====\nThe [[Postsecondary Enrollment Options Act]] was enacted in 1987 to promote rigorous academic pursuits by providing high school students access to enroll part-time in nonsectarian courses in eligible postsecondary institutions. Now offered through Senior Year Plus, the program is available to eligible juniors and seniors as well as freshmen and sophomores who are identified as gifted and talented according to the school district's criteria and procedures. Additional criteria are listed below:\n* The courses are not comparable to courses offered by the high school.\n* The courses must be arts and science courses in the disciplines of mathematics, science, social science, humanities, music and art that include a component of history.\n* The student must file a P.S.E.O. intent to enroll form with his/her counselor during Spring registration and prior to the next school year for each course.\n* Each student's application must be reviewed by a school administrator, who will approve or disapprove the application.\n* The parents are responsible for transportation.\n* When a course is approved by the Superintendent or designee, the school board is responsible for the cost of tuition, textbooks, materials, and fees to a maximum of $250.00 per student for courses not comparable to those offered by Ottumwa High School.\nIf a student drops or fails a P.S.E.O. class, the student will be responsible to reimburse the district for course tuition.\nGrades earned in off-campus courses are not used in the calculation of Ottumwa High School grade point average.\nMaximum opportunity to use P.S.E.O. is specified by law: no more than 4 semester terms or 6 quarter terms unless identified as Talented and Gifted in 9th or 10th grade.\n\n==== Concurrent Enrollment ====\nThe concurrent enrollment program, also known as district-to-community college sharing, promotes rigorous academic or career and technical pursuits by providing opportunities for high school students to enroll part-time in eligible nonsectarian courses at or through community colleges. Per Senior Year Plus, concurrent enrollment courses are offered through contractual agreements between community colleges and school districts within their service area.\n\nThere are classes taught at Ottumwa High School that earn college and high school credit.

It is part of the [[Ottumwa Community School District]], and it is the district's only high school.  It was established in 1923.  The school sports [[mascot]] is a Bulldog.\n\n== History ==\n\nFor several years, students in Ottumwa attended private classes inside area homes.  Later, some students studied inside a local [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist Episcopal]] [[church (building)|church]].  In 1865, the first public school in Ottumwa&mdash;Adams School&mdash;was completed at \"College Square\", an area bounded by College, Fourth, Second, and Union Streets.  The school, which utilized four classrooms on its top floor for the high school, cost $28,818.57<ref name=\"cost\">Meagher, G.; Munsell, H. ''Ottumwa, Yesterday and Today''. p. 49 and 51.</ref> to build, and it sat on the same site as the present-day high school. It was declared unsafe in 1883.  The school board voted to tear down the condemned building and build a new one at the same site.  With more citizens coming to Ottumwa, an additional high school was constructed about a mile west of the Adams School site in 1899.  This building later served as a [[middle school|junior high school]] until it was closed in 1982.\n\n=== Schaefer Stadium ===\nThe Ottumwa High School football/track stadium, known as Schaefer Stadium, was established in the early 1920s in memory of a past student of OHS. Walter B. Schaefer graduated from the Ottumwa High School in 1903 with amazing athletic records and many college football opportunities. He went to the University of Chicago to play football under the famous coaching of Amos Alonzo Stagg, but Schaefer left college early to fight in the war. Schaefer was killed while serving in 1918. He was considered one of the greatest athletes in Iowa and especially in football, which is why the Ottumwa Stadium is now known as Schaefer Stadium. In 2018, Schaefer Stadium was updated. New bleachers for the home side and a new visitor exit were added.\n\n=== Current Building ===\n[[File:Ottumwa High School old.png|left|thumb|This building served as Ottumwa High School from 1899 to 1923.]]\nTo address the growing student population, the Ottumwa Community School District began construction on the current high school building at the same location as the Adams School in 1921.  The \"new\" high school was designed by architects [[Croft & Boerner]] of Minneapolis.  It was completed in 1923.  As part of the construction, the Adams School was lifted from its foundation and moved east&mdash;it would serve as a building for vocational classes at the new high school.\n\nOttumwa High School as it stands today opened on August 29, 1923 to grades 9, 10, 11, and 12.  It reportedly cost just over one [[million]] [[dollar]]s to complete.<ref name=\"cost\" />\n\nIn the 1970s, an additional building was completed&mdash;the \"Vo-Tech\" building&mdash;for [[vocational education|vocational]] and [[performing arts]] classes.  The facility was connected to the main building via a [[skywalk]] accessible from the second floor hallway.  This decade also saw the addition of a second [[gym]]nasium, often nicknamed the \"Rubber Gym\" because of its rubber floor, which was built behind the first gymnasium and replaced the Adams School, which was demolished.\n\n=== Building Expansions ===\nIn the 1990s, a city [[property tax]] was levied to help fund a multi-million dollar renovation project.  The original aim of the project was to renovate the school hallways and some classrooms, add additional basement classrooms, relocate the cafeteria and library to a new area adjacent to the original building and connecting to the Vo-Tech building, renovate and modernize the school's gymnasium facilities ([[locker room|locker]] and [[exercise]] rooms), and remodel the school's [[auditorium]].  The project went over budget, and the gymnasium and auditorium phases were scratched.  The cafeteria and library projects were successfully completed, along with the basement, classroom, and hallway renovations, by the end of the century.  The skywalk formerly connecting the Vo-Tech and main buildings was replaced by the new building.\n\n=== Vision Iowa Grant Renovation ===\nIn spring 2001, the school received a [[Grant (money)|grant]] for nearly $1 million from Vision Iowa to remodel the auditorium which is where they now hold all of their pep rallies, guest speakers, and drama productions.<ref name=\"aud\">''Ottumwa Courier'' (2001), [http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10366638&BRD=2575&PAG=461&dept_id=513091&rfi=8 Ottumwa to receive nearly $1 million for OHS improvements].</ref>  During this renovation some plaster designs were removed from the original 1921-1923 ceiling and placed glass for viewing new the exits. The auditorium was closed from 2002 to 2003 for renovations.  Its grand re-opening took place on November 23, 2003.<ref name=\"aud2\">''Ottumwa Courier'' (November 24, 2002), [http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10356927&BRD=2575&PAG=461&dept_id=513091&rfi=8 Hundreds pack new auditorium].</ref> At the same time, additional renovations to the gymnasium facilities were completed with aid of a federal grant obtained with the help of [[Iowa]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Tom Harkin]].\n\n== Campus ==\n[[File:Iowa Ottumwa High School looking west.jpg|right|thumb|OHS is situated on one of the highest hills in [[Ottumwa, Iowa|Ottumwa]].  This view from the roof is an impressive look at downtown Ottumwa.]]The main [[campus]] of Ottumwa High School consists of a four-story building in [[central business district|downtown]] [[Ottumwa, Iowa|Ottumwa]].  The hill on which the building sits was once the site of [[Wapello (chief)|Chief Wapello's]] tribal village.  Legend suggests he originally called the area \"Ottumwa\" from this spot in 1838.\n\nThe four floors of the main building can be roughly divided by subject areas: the rooms on the bottom floor contain mostly [[social studies]] and [[foreign language]] classrooms; the second floor contains several [[office]]s, [[family and consumer science]] classrooms, and [[mathematics]] classrooms; the third floor is mostly mathematics and [[language arts]] classrooms; and the fourth floor houses [[science]] and language arts classrooms.  The school's auditorium and gymnasium are usually accessed from the second floor, though the auditorium and gyms have entrances on the third floor as well.\n\nThe Vo-Tech building houses vocational classrooms, a [[Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps|JROTC]] room, and a [[Optical fiber|fiber optics network]] room on its first floor.  Performing arts classrooms are located on its second floor.\n\nThe two buildings are connected by a central [[cafeteria]] or commons; this building also houses a second-floor [[library]] with approximately 9,000 volumes.\n\nOttumwa High School does not hold any sporting contests on its campus; instead, the school uses other buildings, public facilities, or the stadium within Ottumwa. The school does maintain a [[parking lot]] for students, and three for faculty.\n\n== Faculty Awards ==\nMr. Hanson, the current principal of OHS, was awarded the \"2015 Iowa Secondary Principal of the Year.\" on May 11, 2015 at a school wide assembly at Ottumwa High School.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ottumwa Leader is Iowa Secondary Principal of the Year|url=http://www.sai-iowa.org/news.cfm/Article/News/Ottumwa-Leader-is-Iowa-Secondary-Principal-of-the-Year/2015-3-11|website=SAI|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref> \n\nIn 2001, anatomy/physiology teacher Gail Wortmann was named \"Iowa Teacher of the Year.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Iowa Teacher of the Year|url=https://www.educateiowa.gov/pk-12/award-exchange-programs/iowa-teacher-year-toy|website=Education Iowa|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref> She was also awarded the Milken Family Foundation Teacher of the Year award in that year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Milken Educator Awards|url=http://www.milkeneducatorawards.org/|website=Milken Educator Awards|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2000\u20132002, science teacher Peggy Steffen served as an Einstein Fellow for [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/nasa-einstein-fellows.html|website=NASA Einstein Fellows|accessdate=26 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Extracurricular activities ==\n\nStudents at Ottumwa High School can participate in many extracurricular activities.

Generations later the region still has deep tennis roots with the year-round all-weather [[Mellon Park#Mellon Park Tennis Center|Mellon Park Tennis Center]] being a world class facility for the sport, and helping to develop natives such as [[Bjorn Fratangelo]], [[Bonnie Gadusek]], [[Donald Johnson]] and [[Gretchen Magers]] in succeeding in international competition and rankings.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1984 the city also hosted a yearly international tournament, the [[Pittsburgh Open]].\n\n===Skiing/skating===\n[[Seven Springs Mountain Resort]], [[Hidden Valley, Pennsylvania]], [[Wisp Ski Resort]] and [[Boyce Park]] offer skiing with both [[PPG Place]] and [[North Park (Pittsburgh)|North Park]] offering ice skating.

In the first half of the 20th century, Pitt, Duquesne, and Carnegie Tech (now called Carnegie Mellon) all fielded football squads that made \"major\" bowl game appearances from the 1920s through the 1930s. These appearances included Duquesne in the 1933 and 1936 [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], Carnegie Tech in the 1938 [[Sugar Bowl]], and the University of Pittsburgh appearing in four [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowls]] (1927, 1929, 1932, 1936) as well as nearby [[Washington and Jefferson College]] in the [[1922 Rose Bowl]].<ref>[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/national_championships/year_by_year.php College Football Data Warehouse]</ref> In particular, Pitt was a national power during this era, claiming 8 national championships under the guidance of coaching legends such as [[Pop Warner]] and [[Jock Sutherland]].

The city's first [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) franchise, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates (NHL)|Pittsburgh Pirates]] were the first to wear black and gold as their colors.

The league played its games in three Pittsburgh hockey arenas, the Gardens, the [[Schenley Park Casino]] and the [[Winter Garden at Exposition Hall]].

Founded in 1933, it is located in [[La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, California|La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge]], [[California]].\n\n==Facilities==\nSchool facilities include a science/cultural center, multiple classroom buildings with labs (renovated in 2014\u20132015, two computer laboratories, a state-of-the-art two-story library, a performing arts center, a 400-seat auditorium (renovated in 2015), an administration building with faculty offices, and an alumni and development office building.\n\nThe Chandramohan Library is a two-story library and learning center that includes a computer lab, a classroom for seminars, meeting rooms, space for individual and group study, and a laptop room.\n\nThe Randall Performing Arts Center includes practice rooms for individuals and groups of musicians, as well as dance rehearsal space. Miller Theater is a black-box theater that is used for many of the school's drama performances.\n\nAthletics facilities include a full-size gymnasium, a six-lane swimming pool, a multi-sport playing field with a softball diamond, and a soccer field. Athletics facilities also include a fully equipped weight-training room and a professional training room for injury prevention and rehabilitation. \n== Student experience ==\nFlintridge Prep emphasizes academic engagement, strong relationships between faculty and students, and a variety of student leadership opportunities, including 50+ clubs, a peer counseling program, an outdoor education program, and a student-run government called Student Senate.\n\nSeniors participate in a series of culminating projects, including independent study projects, in which they study with a faculty or community member of their choice in their final semester of school. Roughly a third of students participate in Independent Studies. Altogether more than 80% of seniors participate in an end-of-year presentation of their research.\n\nBeginning in 8th grade, students begin an integrated leadership program, which culminates in 95% of students taking leadership roles in their final year of high school. The school also has STEAM and robotics programs, as well as a Student Community Impact Council, which fosters meaningful service impact in the local, regional and international community.\n\nMore than 50% of students participate in performing arts, and two-thirds of high school students participate in one of the school's 13 varsity sports.\n\n== History, traditions and values ==\nFounded as an all-boys school, the school became coed in the academic year 1979\u201380.\n\nEach fall, all members of the community (including faculty and staff) sign the honor code, the universal code of ethics across campus. The Family BBQ, STEAM & Service Fair and Junior Parent Dinner are other annual traditions. Homecoming, Alumni Sports Day and reunions are a few of the annual traditions that bring the community together.\n\nStudents go through several rites of passage, including retreats and class trips. The culmination of life at Prep is the Pine Cone Ceremony, which occurs on the last night of the Senior Trip, just before Commencement.\n\nThe Senior Patio and Lawn are closely \u201cguarded\u201c by seniors throughout the academic year. Each May, the rising junior class receives its senior privileges and takes over the Senior Patio.\n\n==Accreditation==\nFlintridge Prep is accredited by the California Association of Independent Schools and is a charter member of the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]]. It holds memberships in the California Association of Independent Schools, the National Association of Independent Schools, the Western Association of College Counselors, the Cum Laude Society, and the Educational Records Bureau. Flintridge complies with the National Association for College Admission Counseling's Statement of Principles of Good Practice. It also participates in the American Field Service and the Independent School Alliance for Minority Affairs.\n\n==Admissions, enrollment and financial aid==\nThe student body includes approximately 500 students in grades 7 through 12, about 100 of whom are seniors.\n\nThere are two main entry points into Prep, in 7th grade and in 9th, although candidates are sometimes admitted at other grade levels. The admissions process begins in the fall preceding the school year for which applicants are interested in applying and consists of completing an application, submitting teacher recommendations and transcripts, taking the Independent School Entrance Exam (ISEE) and having an interview. Students attend the school Prep from 99 schools. Once admitted, students tend to stay. The school hosts an annual Open House for prospective families in December.\n\nFinancial aid is available, and in 2017, the school awarded $2,470,000 in aid to 25% of the student body for the 2017\u20132018 school year. The average amount of aid is 56% of tuition.\n\n==Faculty==\nThere are 67 faculty members. 35 have master's degrees, and 10 have doctoral degrees.\n\nThe college counseling office is staffed by three counselors.\n\n==Grades and rank==\nThe school runs on a semester system, with four grading periods per year. Grades re-recorded at the end of each course. A year course yields one credit in that subject. Students normally take 5-8 credits each year. Class periods are 43 minutes long and meet 3-5 times per week. Students are not ranked. GPA is based on all course work except PE.\n\nThe school does not award Valedictorian and Salutatorian honors. The highest academic awards are the Founder's Trophy, which recognizes a graduate who, in the opinion of the faculty, best represents the following school ideals: academic skills and dedication, the ability to be a team member as well as a leader, and the willingness to contribute to the well-being of one's fellow students and to the community. The school also awards the Benton Memorial Award to a graduate who represents, in the opinion of the faculty, outstanding sensitivity and creativity in intellectual pursuits.\n\n==Graduation requirements==\n4 years of English, 3 of math, 3 of world languages, 3 of history; 2 of laboratory science, and 2 of fine arts are required. Community service hours are not counted as a graduation requirement, but a commitment to service through the school's Student Community Action Council and other leadership programs is encouraged. Physical education is required through sophomore year.\n\n==Notable students and alumni==\n*[[Ramses Barden]], wide receiver for the [[Cal Poly Mustangs]], [[New York Giants]]\n*[[Stephen J.

Athletics facilities also include a fully equipped weight-training room and a professional training room for injury prevention and rehabilitation. \n== Student experience ==\nFlintridge Prep emphasizes academic engagement, strong relationships between faculty and students, and a variety of student leadership opportunities, including 50+ clubs, a peer counseling program, an outdoor education program, and a student-run government called Student Senate.\n\nSeniors participate in a series of culminating projects, including independent study projects, in which they study with a faculty or community member of their choice in their final semester of school. Roughly a third of students participate in Independent Studies. Altogether more than 80% of seniors participate in an end-of-year presentation of their research.\n\nBeginning in 8th grade, students begin an integrated leadership program, which culminates in 95% of students taking leadership roles in their final year of high school. The school also has STEAM and robotics programs, as well as a Student Community Impact Council, which fosters meaningful service impact in the local, regional and international community.\n\nMore than 50% of students participate in performing arts, and two-thirds of high school students participate in one of the school's 13 varsity sports.\n\n== History, traditions and values ==\nFounded as an all-boys school, the school became coed in the academic year 1979-80.\n\nEach fall, all members of the community (including faculty and staff) sign the honor code, the universal code of ethics across campus. The Family BBQ, STEAM & Service Fair and Junior Parent Dinner are other annual traditions. Homecoming, Alumni Sports Day and reunions are a few of the annual traditions that bring the community together.\n\nStudents go through several rites of passage, including retreats and class trips. The culmination of life at Prep is the Pine Cone Ceremony, which occurs on the last night of the Senior Trip, just before Commencement.\n\nThe Senior Patio and Lawn are closely \u201cguarded\u201c by seniors throughout the academic year. Each May, the rising junior class receives its senior privileges and takes over the Senior Patio.\n\n==Accreditation==\nFlintridge Prep is accredited by the California Association of Independent Schools and is a charter member of the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]]. It holds memberships in the California Association of Independent Schools, the National Association of Independent Schools, the Western Association of College Counselors, the Cum Laude Society, and the Educational Records Bureau. Flintridge complies with the National Association for College Admission Counseling's Statement of Principles of Good Practice. It also participates in the American Field Service and the Independent School Alliance for Minority Affairs.\n\n==Admissions, enrollment and financial aid==\nThe student body includes approximately 500 students in grades 7 through 12, about 100 of whom are seniors.\n\nThere are two main entry points into Prep, in 7th grade and in 9th, although candidates are sometimes admitted at other grade levels. The admissions process begins in the fall preceding the school year for which applicants are interested in applying and consists of completing an application, submitting teacher recommendations and transcripts, taking the Independent School Entrance Exam (ISEE) and having an interview. Students attend the school Prep from 99 schools. Once admitted, students tend to stay. The school hosts an annual Open House for prospective families in December.\n\nFinancial aid is available, and in 2017, the school awarded $2,470,000 in aid to 25% of the student body for the 2017-2018 school year. The average amount of aid is 56% of tuition.\n\n==Faculty==\nThere are 67 faculty members. 35 have master's degrees, and 10 have doctoral degrees.\n\nThe college counseling office is staffed by three counselors.\n\n==Grades and rank==\nThe school runs on a semester system, with four grading periods per year. Grades re-recorded at the end of each course. A year course yields one credit in that subject. Students normally take 5-8 credits each year. Class periods are 43 minutes long and meet 3-5 times per week. Students are not ranked. GPA is based on all course work except PE.\n\nThe school does not award Valedictorian and Salutatorian honors. The highest academic awards are the Founder's Trophy, which recognizes a graduate who, in the opinion of the faculty, best represents the following school ideals: academic skills and dedication, the ability to be a team member as well as a leader, and the willingness to contribute to the well-being of one's fellow students and to the community. The school also awards the Benton Memorial Award to a graduate who represents, in the opinion of the faculty, outstanding sensitivity and creativity in intellectual pursuits.\n\n==Graduation requirements==\n4 years of English, 3 of math, 3 of world languages, 3 of history; 2 of laboratory science, and 2 of fine arts are required. Community service hours are not counted as a graduation requirement, but a commitment to service through the school's Student Community Action Council and other leadership programs is encouraged.
