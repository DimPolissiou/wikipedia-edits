It was released on October 25, 2019, through [[GOOD Music]] and distributed by [[Def Jam Recordings]]. The album follows a [[Christianity|Christian]] theme, with West describing it as \"an expression of [[the gospel]].\" West had formed his [[Gospel music|gospel]] group the [[Sunday Service Choir]] in January 2019, performing gospel songs and covers of songs from West's discography. The song \"[[Water (Kanye West song)|Water]]\" was performed live prior to release by the group.\n\n''Jesus Is King'' features guest appearances from [[Clipse]], [[Ty Dolla Sign]], [[Kenny G]], [[Fred Hammond]], [[Ant Clemons]], and the Sunday Service Choir. Production is included from West, [[Benny Blanco]], BoogzDaBeast, [[Francis Starlite]], [[Pi'erre Bourne]], and [[Timbaland]], among others. West quit taking medication for his [[bipolar disorder]] and began recording the album in August 2018, originally announcing it as ''Yandhi''. The album missed two initial release dates in September and November 2018 under the original title, before being delayed indefinitely.\n\nIn August 2019, West's wife [[Kim Kardashian]] reannounced ''Yandhi'' as ''Jesus Is King'', but it missed two planned release dates for late September 2019 under the new title. The final release was simultaneous with that of a [[concert film]] [[Jesus Is King (film)|of the same name]], which included a number of the tracks as part of the soundtrack. \"[[Follow God]]\" was released as the lead single in November 2019, followed by \"[[Closed on Sunday]]\" later that same month. The album received mixed reviews from music critics. Some praised it in comparison to West's previous solo album ''[[Ye (album)|Ye]]'' and complemented the composition, while other critics expressed negative feelings towards the lyrical content and the inconsistency of ideas.\n\n''Jesus Is King'' stood as West's record-equaling ninth consecutive album to debut atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. With the release, West became the first artist to occupy all top ten spots on the US [[Christian Songs]] and [[Billboard charts|Gospel Songs]] charts, respectively. West broke another record at the same time by being the first artist to simultaneously top five separate US charts: the ''Billboard'' 200, [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]], [[Top Rap Albums]], [[List of number-one Billboard Christian Albums|Top Christian Albums]] and [[Top Gospel Albums]]. The album was a chart topper in eight other countries, including Australia and Canada, while attaining top five positions in the Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. A companion album, ''[[Jesus Is Born]]'', was released in December 2019 by the Sunday Service Choir, and West's collaborative sequel album ''[[Jesus Is King Part II]]'' with [[Dr. Dre]] is slated for a future release.\n\n==Background and recording==\n===August \u2013 November 2018: ''Yandhi'', Chicago and Uganda===\nThroughout May and June 2018, five seven-track albums produced by West at his ranch in [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming]] were successively released as the Wyoming Sessions. [[Pusha T]]'s third studio album ''[[Daytona (album)|Daytona]]'' was released first, followed by West's eighth studio album ''[[Ye (album)|Ye]]'', West's collaborative studio album ''[[Kids See Ghosts (album)|Kids See Ghosts]]'', with [[Kid Cudi]] as [[Kids See Ghosts]], [[Nas]]' twelfth studio album ''[[Nasir (album)|Nasir]]'', and [[Teyana Taylor]]'s second studio album ''[[K.T.S.E.]]''; all of the albums were released in 2018. On ''Ye'', West acknowledged his [[bipolar disorder]] diagnosis. He stopped taking his medication for the disorder in June 2018 during the rollout of the Wyoming Sessions albums.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/kanye-mental-health/|title=Kanye: \"6 months off meds I can feel me again\"|date=December 15, 2018|accessdate=March 11, 2019|magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]]|first=Alex|last=Young|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215215103/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/kanye-mental-health/|archive-date=December 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2018/12/13/nicki-minaj-kanye-west-tekashi-6ix9ine-worst-album-rollout-2018/|title=Nicki Minaj, Kanye West, Tekashi 6ix9ine: Which Rapper Had The Worst Album Rollout Of 2018?|magazine=[[Forbes]]|date=December 13, 2018|first=Bryan|last=Rolli|accessdate=September 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214123613/https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2018/12/13/nicki-minaj-kanye-west-tekashi-6ix9ine-worst-album-rollout-2018/|archive-date=December 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018, Chicago music artist [[Chance the Rapper]] announced that West was coming to Chicago to produce for his seven-track debut studio album.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8465190/chance-the-rapper-kanye-west-chicago-produce-new-album|title=Chance the Rapper Says Kanye West Is Heading to Chicago to Produce His New Album|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 12, 2018|first=Carl|last=Lamarre|accessdate=March 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714091209/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8465190/chance-the-rapper-kanye-west-chicago-produce-new-album|archive-date=July 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|Chance the Rapper's debut studio album ''[[The Big Day (album)|The Big Day]]'' was later released in July 2019 with no contributions from West.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/chance-rapper-the-big-day-new-album|title=Chance The Rapper drops ''The Big Day'', featuring everyone but Kanye West|date=July 26, 2019|accessdate=September 9, 2019|website=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727021530/https://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/chance-rapper-the-big-day-new-album|archive-date=July 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>}} West was seen in the city at the end of August 2018, and simultaneously confirmed to [[Fox News]] that the two of them were recording music together.<ref name=\"August\">{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/kanye-west-chicago-chance-the-rapper-album/|title=Kanye West in Chicago working with Chance the Rapper|date=August 29, 2018|accessdate=March 13, 2019|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|first=Alice|last=Bazerghi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829193755/https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/kanye-west-chicago-chance-the-rapper-album/|archive-date=August 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/kanye-chance-the-rapper-new-album/|title=Kanye in Chicago to work on Chance the Rapper's new album|date=August 30, 2018|accessdate=September 19, 2019|magazine=Consequence of Sound|first=Alex|last=Young|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830084551/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/kanye-chance-the-rapper-new-album/|archive-date=August 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> West later stated that his recording sessions with Chance the Rapper had helped the former reconnect with his roots and faith in [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/08/kanye-west-new-album-jesus-is-king-timeline/december-15-2018|title=Kanye West's Road From 'Yandhi' to 'Jesus Is King'|date=August 30, 2019|accessdate=September 9, 2019|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|first=Jessica|last=McKinney|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831145326/https://www.complex.com/music/2019/08/kanye-west-new-album-jesus-is-king-timeline/|archive-date=August 31, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The following month, West released the collaborative single \"[[I Love It (Kanye West and Lil Pump song)|I Love It]]\" with fellow rapper [[Lil Pump]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hot97.com/news/news/kanye-west-releases-brand-new-nsfw-single-i-love-it-ft-lil-pump-video|title=Kanye West Releases Brand New NSFW Single 'I Love It' ft.

It was released on October 25, 2019, through [[GOOD Music]] and distributed by [[Def Jam Recordings]]. The album follows a [[Christianity|Christian]] theme, with West describing it as \"an expression of [[the gospel]].\" West had formed his [[Gospel music|gospel]] group the [[Sunday Service Choir]] in January 2019, performing gospel songs and covers of songs from West's discography. The song \"[[Water (Kanye West song)|Water]]\" was performed live prior to release by the group.\n\n''Jesus Is King'' features guest appearances from [[Clipse]], [[Ty Dolla Sign]], [[Kenny G]], [[Fred Hammond]], [[Ant Clemons]], and the Sunday Service Choir. Production is included from West, [[Benny Blanco]], BoogzDaBeast, [[Francis Starlite]], [[Pi'erre Bourne]], and [[Timbaland]], among others. West quit taking medication for his [[bipolar disorder]] and began recording the album in August 2018, originally announcing it as ''Yandhi''. The album missed two initial release dates in September and November 2018 under the original title, before being delayed indefinitely.\n\nIn August 2019, West's wife [[Kim Kardashian]] reannounced ''Yandhi'' as ''Jesus Is King'', but it missed two planned release dates for late September 2019 under the new title. The final release was simultaneous with that of a [[concert film]] [[Jesus Is King (film)|of the same name]], which included a number of the tracks as part of the soundtrack. \"[[Follow God]]\" was released as the lead single in November 2019, followed by \"[[Closed on Sunday]]\" later that same month. The album received mixed reviews from music critics. Some praised it in comparison to West's previous solo album ''[[Ye (album)|Ye]]'' and complemented the composition, while other critics expressed negative feelings towards the lyrical content and the inconsistency of ideas.\n\n''Jesus Is King'' stood as West's record-equaling ninth consecutive album to debut atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. With the release, West became the first artist to occupy all top ten spots on the US [[Christian Songs]] and [[Billboard charts|Gospel Songs]] charts, respectively. West broke another record at the same time by being the first artist to simultaneously top five separate US charts: the ''Billboard'' 200, [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]], [[Top Rap Albums]], [[List of number-one Billboard Christian Albums|Top Christian Albums]] and [[Top Gospel Albums]]. The album was a chart topper in eight other countries, including Australia and Canada, while attaining top five positions in the Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. A companion album, ''[[Jesus Is Born]]'', was released in December 2019 by the Sunday Service Choir, and West's collaborative sequel album ''[[Jesus Is King Part II]]'' with [[Dr. Dre]] is slated for a future release.\n\n==Background and recording==\n===August \u2013 November 2018: ''Yandhi'', Chicago and Uganda===\nThroughout May and June 2018, five seven-track albums produced by West at his ranch in [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming]] were successively released as the Wyoming Sessions. [[Pusha T]]'s third studio album ''[[Daytona (album)|Daytona]]'' was released first, followed by West's eighth studio album ''[[Ye (album)|Ye]]'', West's collaborative studio album ''[[Kids See Ghosts (album)|Kids See Ghosts]]'', with [[Kid Cudi]] as [[Kids See Ghosts]], [[Nas]]' twelfth studio album ''[[Nasir (album)|Nasir]]'', and [[Teyana Taylor]]'s second studio album ''[[K.T.S.E.]]''; all of the albums were released in 2018. On ''Ye'', West acknowledged his [[bipolar disorder]] diagnosis. He stopped taking his medication for the disorder in June 2018 during the rollout of the Wyoming Sessions albums.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/kanye-mental-health/|title=Kanye: \"6 months off meds I can feel me again\"|date=December 15, 2018|accessdate=March 11, 2019|magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]]|first=Alex|last=Young|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215215103/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/kanye-mental-health/|archive-date=December 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2018/12/13/nicki-minaj-kanye-west-tekashi-6ix9ine-worst-album-rollout-2018/|title=Nicki Minaj, Kanye West, Tekashi 6ix9ine: Which Rapper Had The Worst Album Rollout Of 2018?|magazine=[[Forbes]]|date=December 13, 2018|first=Bryan|last=Rolli|accessdate=September 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214123613/https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2018/12/13/nicki-minaj-kanye-west-tekashi-6ix9ine-worst-album-rollout-2018/|archive-date=December 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018, Chicago music artist [[Chance the Rapper]] announced that West was coming to Chicago to produce for his seven-track debut studio album.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8465190/chance-the-rapper-kanye-west-chicago-produce-new-album|title=Chance the Rapper Says Kanye West Is Heading to Chicago to Produce His New Album|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 12, 2018|first=Carl|last=Lamarre|accessdate=March 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714091209/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8465190/chance-the-rapper-kanye-west-chicago-produce-new-album|archive-date=July 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|Chance the Rapper's debut studio album ''[[The Big Day (album)|The Big Day]]'' was later released in July 2019 with no contributions from West.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/chance-rapper-the-big-day-new-album|title=Chance The Rapper drops ''The Big Day'', featuring everyone but Kanye West|date=July 26, 2019|accessdate=September 9, 2019|website=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727021530/https://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/chance-rapper-the-big-day-new-album|archive-date=July 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>}} West was seen in the city at the end of August 2018, and simultaneously confirmed to [[Fox News]] that the two of them were recording music together.<ref name=\"August\">{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/kanye-west-chicago-chance-the-rapper-album/|title=Kanye West in Chicago working with Chance the Rapper|date=August 29, 2018|accessdate=March 13, 2019|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|first=Alice|last=Bazerghi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829193755/https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/kanye-west-chicago-chance-the-rapper-album/|archive-date=August 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/kanye-chance-the-rapper-new-album/|title=Kanye in Chicago to work on Chance the Rapper's new album|date=August 30, 2018|accessdate=September 19, 2019|magazine=Consequence of Sound|first=Alex|last=Young|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830084551/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/kanye-chance-the-rapper-new-album/|archive-date=August 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> West later stated that his recording sessions with Chance the Rapper had helped the former reconnect with his roots and faith in [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/08/kanye-west-new-album-jesus-is-king-timeline/december-15-2018|title=Kanye West's Road From 'Yandhi' to 'Jesus Is King'|date=August 30, 2019|accessdate=September 9, 2019|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|first=Jessica|last=McKinney|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831145326/https://www.complex.com/music/2019/08/kanye-west-new-album-jesus-is-king-timeline/|archive-date=August 31, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The following month, West released the collaborative single \"[[I Love It (Kanye West and Lil Pump song)|I Love It]]\" with fellow rapper [[Lil Pump]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hot97.com/news/news/kanye-west-releases-brand-new-nsfw-single-i-love-it-ft-lil-pump-video|title=Kanye West Releases Brand New NSFW Single 'I Love It' ft.

He also served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Brent East (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent East]] from [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]] to [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]]. A former member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], he was on the party's left wing, ideologically identifying as a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]].\n\nBorn in [[Lambeth]], [[South London]], to a working-class family, Livingstone joined Labour in 1968 and was elected to represent [[West Norwood|Norwood]] at the GLC in [[1973 Greater London Council election|1973]], [[Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney North and Stoke Newington]] in [[1977 Greater London Council election|1977]], and [[Paddington]] in [[1981 Greater London Council election|1981]]. That year, Labour representatives on the GLC elected him as the council's leader. Attempting to [[Fares Fair|reduce London Underground fares]], his plans were challenged in court and declared unlawful; more successful were his schemes to benefit women and underprivileged minorities, despite stiff opposition. The mainstream media gave him the moniker \"Red Ken\" in reference to his socialist beliefs and heavily criticised him for supporting controversial issues like [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republicanism]], [[LGBT rights]], and a [[United Ireland]]. Livingstone was a vocal opponent of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] government of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], which in 1986 abolished the GLC. Elected as MP for Brent East in 1987, he became closely associated with [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] campaigns. He unsuccessfully stood for [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party leader]] on a leftist platform in 1992 and 1994, in the latter losing to [[Tony Blair]]. Livingstone became a vocal critic of Blair's [[New Labour]] project that pushed the party closer to [[centrism|the centre]] and won the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]].\n\nAfter failing to become Labour's candidate in the [[2000 London mayoral election]], Livingstone successfully contested the election as an [[independent politician|independent candidate]]. In his first term as Mayor of London, he introduced the [[London congestion charge|congestion charge]], [[Oyster card]], and [[articulated bus]]es, and unsuccessfully opposed the government's privatisation of [[London Underground]]. Despite his opposition to Blair's government on issues like the [[Iraq War]], Livingstone was invited to stand for re-election as Labour's candidate and was [[2004 London mayoral election|re-elected in 2004]], expanding his transport policies, introducing new environmental regulations, and enacting civil rights policies. Initiating and overseeing London's winning bid to host the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and ushering in a major redevelopment of the city's [[East End of London|East End]], his leadership after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] was widely praised.

Livingstone backed the strikers, urging Camden Council to grant their demands, eventually getting his way. District auditor Ian Pickwell, a government-appointed accountant who monitored council finances, claimed that this move was reckless and illegal, taking Camden Council to court. If found guilty, Livingstone would have been held personally responsible for the measure, forced to pay the massive [[surcharge (sanction)|surcharge]], and been disqualified for public office for five years; ultimately the judge threw out the case.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=66\u201367|2a1=Livingstone|2y=1987|2pp=99\u2013100|3a1=Hosken|3y=2008|3pp=62\u201363}}\n\nIn May 1979, a [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election was held in the United Kingdom]].

This was a popular message among many Labour activists amassed under the SCLV. The primary figurehead for this leftist trend was [[Tony Benn]], who narrowly missed being elected deputy leader of Labour in September 1981, under new party leader [[Michael Foot]]. The head of the \"Bennite left\", Benn became \"an inspiration and a prophet\" to Livingstone; the two became the best known left-wingers in Labour.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=67\u201368|2a1=Livingstone|2y=1987|2pp=90\u201391|3a1=Hosken|3y=2008|3pp=67\u201369|4a1=Turner|4y=2010|4p=32}}\n\n==Greater London Council leadership==\n{{Main|Greater London Council leadership of Ken Livingstone}}\n\n===Becoming leader of the GLC: 1979\u20131981===\nInspired by the Bennites, Livingstone planned a GLC take-over; on 18 October 1979, he called a meeting of Labour leftists entitled \"Taking over the GLC\", beginning publication of monthly newsletter the ''London Labour Briefing''.

Others stayed in their former positions, including Dave Wetzel as transport chair and Mike Ward as chair of industry; thus was created what biographer John Carvel described as \"the second Livingstone administration\", leading to a \"more calm and supportive environment\".{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=149, 195}} Turning his attention once more to Parliament, Livingstone sought to be selected as the Labour candidate for the constituency of [[Brent East (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent East]], a place which he felt an \"affinity\" for and where several of his friends lived. At the time, the Brent East Labour Party was characterised by competing factions, with Livingstone attempting to gain the support of both the hard and soft left. Securing a significant level of support from local party members, he nonetheless failed to apply for the candidacy in time, and so the incumbent centrist [[Reg Freeson]] was once more selected as Labour candidate for Brent East. A subsequent vote at the council meeting revealed that 52 local Labour members would have voted for Livingstone, with only 2 for Freeson and 3 abstentions. Nevertheless, in the [[1983 United Kingdom general election]], Freeson went on to win the Brent East constituency for Labour.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=166\u2013175|2a1=Hosken|2y=2008|2pp=174\u2013181}} In 1983, Livingstone began co-presenting a late night television chat show with [[Janet Street-Porter]] for [[London Weekend Television]].{{sfn|Carvel|1984|p=199}}\n\n====Fares Fair and transport policy====\n\nThe Greater London Labour Manifesto for the 1981 elections, although written under McIntosh's leadership, had been determined by a special conference of the London Labour Party in October 1980 in which Livingstone's speech had been decisive on transport policy. The manifesto focused on job creation schemes and cutting London Transport fares, and it was to these issues that Livingstone's administration turned.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=83\u201384|2a1=Hosken|2y=2008|2p=101}} One primary manifesto focus had been a pledge known as [[Fares Fair]], which focused on reducing [[London Underground]] fares and freezing them at that lower rate. Based on a fare freeze implemented by the [[South Yorkshire|South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council]] in 1975, it was widely considered to be a moderate and mainstream policy by Labour, which it was hoped would get more Londoners using public transport, thereby reducing congestion. In October 1981, the GLC implemented their policy, cutting London Transport fares by 32%; to fund the move, the GLC planned to increase the London [[Rates (tax)|rates]].{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=115\u2013118}}\n\nThe legality of the Fares Fair policy was challenged by Dennis Barkway, Conservative leader of the [[London Borough of Bromley]] council, who complained that his constituents were having to pay for cheaper fares on the London Underground when it did not operate in their borough. Although the Divisional Court initially found in favour of the GLC, Bromley Borough took the issue to the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]], where three judges \u2013 [[Lord Denning]], [[Peter Oliver, Baron Oliver of Aylmerton|Lord Justice Oliver]] and Lord Justice Watkins \u2013 reversed the previous decision, finding in favour of Bromley Borough on 10 November. They proclaimed that the Fares Fair policy was illegal because the GLC was expressly forbidden from choosing to run London Transport at a deficit, even if this was in the perceived interest of Londoners.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=128\u2013133|2a1=Hosken|2y=2008|2pp=117\u2013118}} The GLC appealed this decision, taking the case to the [[House of Lords]]; on 17 December five Law Lords unanimously ruled in favour of Bromley Borough Council, putting a permanent end to the Fares Fair policy.{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=135\u2013136}} GLC transport chairman Dave Wetzel labelled the judges \"Vandals in Ermine\" while Livingstone maintained his belief that the judicial decision was politically motivated.{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\nInitially presenting a motion to the GLC Labour groups that they refuse to comply with the judicial decision and continue with the policy regardless, but was out-voted by 32\u201322; many commentators claimed that Livingstone had only been bluffing in order to save face among the Labour Left.{{Sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=140\u2013143}} Instead, Livingstone got on board with a campaign known as \"Keep Fares Fair\" in order to bring about a change in the law that would make the Fares Fair policy legal; an alternate movement, \"Can't Pay, Won't Pay\", accused Livingstone of being a sell-out and insisted that the GLC proceed with its policies regardless of their legality.{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=148\u2013150}} One aspect of the London Transport reforms was however maintained; the new system of [[London Underground ticketing|flat fares within ticket zones]], and the inter-modal [[Travelcard]] ticket continues as the basis of the ticketing system.{{sfn|Turner|2010|p=80}} The GLC then put together new measures in the hope of reducing London Transport fares by the more modest amount of 25%, taking them back to roughly the price that they were when Livingstone's administration took office; it was ruled legal in January 1983, and subsequently implemented.{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=203\u2013204}}\n\n====GLEB and nuclear disarmament====\nLivingstone's administration founded the Greater London Enterprise Board (GLEB) to create employment by investing in the industrial regeneration of London, with the funds provided by the council, its workers' pension fund and the financial markets. Livingstone later claimed that GLC bureaucrats obstructed much of what GLEB tried to achieve.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1p=126|2a1=Livingstone|2y=1987|2pp=148\u2013149}} Other policies implemented by the Labour Left also foundered. Attempts to prevent the sale-off of GLC council housing largely failed, in part due to the strong opposition from the Conservative government.{{Sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=124\u2013126}} ILEA attempted to carry through with its promise to cut the price of [[school meals]] in the capital from 35p to 25p, but was forced to abandon its plans following legal advice that the councillors could be made to pay the surcharge and disqualified from public office.{{sfn|Carvel|1984|p=124}}\n\nThe Livingstone administration took a strong stance on the issue of [[nuclear disarmament]], proclaiming London a \"[[nuclear-free zone]]\". On 20 May 1981, the GLC halted its annual spending of \u00a31 million on nuclear war defence plans, with Livingstone's deputy, Illtyd Harrington, proclaiming that \"we are challenging... the absurd cosmetic approach to Armageddon.\" They published the names of the 3000 politicians and administrators who had been earmarked for survival in underground bunkers in the event of a nuclear strike on London. Thatcher's government remained highly critical of these moves, putting out a propaganda campaign explaining their argument for the necessity of Britain's [[Deterrence theory|nuclear deterrent]] to counter the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Hosken|2008|pp=152\u2013155}}\n\n====Egalitarian policies====\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=\"Arguing that politics had long been the near-exclusive preserve of white middle-aged men, the GLC began an attempt to open itself to representations from other groups, principally from women, the working-class, ethnic minorities and homosexuals but also from children and the elderly.

He also served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Brent East (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent East]] from [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987]] to [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]]. A former member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], he was on the party's left wing, ideologically identifying as a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]].\n\nBorn in [[Lambeth]], [[South London]], to a working-class family, Livingstone joined Labour in 1968 and was elected to represent [[West Norwood|Norwood]] at the GLC in [[1973 Greater London Council election|1973]], [[Hackney North and Stoke Newington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney North and Stoke Newington]] in [[1977 Greater London Council election|1977]], and [[Paddington]] in [[1981 Greater London Council election|1981]]. That year, Labour representatives on the GLC elected him as the council's leader. Attempting to [[Fares Fair|reduce London Underground fares]], his plans were challenged in court and declared unlawful; more successful were his schemes to benefit women and underprivileged minorities, despite stiff opposition. The mainstream media gave him the moniker \"Red Ken\" in reference to his socialist beliefs and heavily criticised him for supporting controversial issues like [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republicanism]], [[LGBT rights]], and a [[United Ireland]]. Livingstone was a vocal opponent of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] government of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], which in 1986 abolished the GLC. Elected as MP for Brent East in 1987, he became closely associated with [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] campaigns. He unsuccessfully stood for [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party leader]] on a leftist platform in 1992 and 1994, in the latter losing to [[Tony Blair]]. Livingstone became a vocal critic of Blair's [[New Labour]] project that pushed the party closer to [[centrism|the centre]] and won the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]].\n\nAfter failing to become Labour's candidate in the [[2000 London mayoral election]], Livingstone successfully contested the election as an [[independent politician|independent candidate]]. In his first term as Mayor of London, he introduced the [[London congestion charge|congestion charge]], [[Oyster card]], and [[articulated bus]]es, and unsuccessfully opposed the government's privatisation of [[London Underground]]. Despite his opposition to Blair's government on issues like the [[Iraq War]], Livingstone was invited to stand for re-election as Labour's candidate and was [[2004 London mayoral election|re-elected in 2004]], expanding his transport policies, introducing new environmental regulations, and enacting civil rights policies. Initiating and overseeing London's winning bid to host the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and ushering in a major redevelopment of the city's [[East End of London|East End]], his leadership after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] was widely praised. He stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate in London's mayoral elections of [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] and [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]], losing both to the Conservative candidate [[Boris Johnson]]. A longstanding critic of [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict|Israeli policy regarding the Palestinians]], his comments about the relationship between [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Zionism]] resulted in his suspension from the Labour Party in 2016; he then resigned in 2018.\n\nCharacterised by [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] as \"the only truly successful left-wing British politician of modern times\",{{sfnm|1a1=Moore|1y=2007|2a1=Purnell|2y=2011|2p=314|3a1=Eaton|3y=2014}} Livingstone was praised for his efforts to improve rights for women, LGBT people, and ethnic minorities in London, but also faced allegations of [[cronyism]] and [[antisemitism]] and was criticised for his connections to [[Islamism|Islamists]], [[Marxism|Marxists]], and [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]].\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood and young adulthood: 1945\u20131967===\nLivingstone was born in his grandmother's house in [[Lambeth]], [[south London]], on 17 June 1945.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=26, 28|2a1=Hosken|2y=2008|2p=1}} His family was working class; his mother, Ethel Ada (n\u00e9e Kennard, 1915\u20131997), had been born in [[Southwark]] before training as an [[acrobatic dance]]r and working on the [[music hall]] circuit prior to the [[Second World War]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1p=27|2a1=Carvel|2y=1999|2p=17|3a1=Hosken|3y=2008|3pp=1\u20132}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk|title=Births England and Wales 1837\u20131915 |publisher=Freebmd.org.uk |date=21 June 2010|accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref> Ken's Scottish father, Robert \"Bob\" Moffat Livingstone (1915\u20131971), had been born in [[Dunoon]] before joining the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] in 1932 and becoming a ship's master.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=27\u201328|2a1=Carvel|2y=1999|2pp=18, 36|3a1=Hosken|3y=2008|3p=2|4a1=Edwards|4a2=Isaby|4y=2008|4pp=32\u201333}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Family Detective:Ken Livingstone|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?xml=/portal/2007/04/07/nosplit/ftdet107.xml|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London, UK|first=Nick|last=Barratt|date=7 April 2007|accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nHaving first met in April 1940 at a music hall in [[Workington]], they married within three months.

Livingstone backed the strikers, urging Camden Council to grant their demands, eventually getting his way. District auditor Ian Pickwell, a government-appointed accountant who monitored council finances, claimed that this move was reckless and illegal, taking Camden Council to court. If found guilty, Livingstone would have been held personally responsible for the measure, forced to pay the massive [[surcharge (sanction)|surcharge]], and been disqualified for public office for five years; ultimately the judge threw out the case.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=66\u201367|2a1=Livingstone|2y=1987|2pp=99\u2013100|3a1=Hosken|3y=2008|3pp=62\u201363}}\n\nIn May 1979, a [[1979 United Kingdom general election|general election was held in the United Kingdom]].

This was a popular message among many Labour activists amassed under the SCLV. The primary figurehead for this leftist trend was [[Tony Benn]], who narrowly missed being elected deputy leader of Labour in September 1981, under new party leader [[Michael Foot]]. The head of the \"Bennite left\", Benn became \"an inspiration and a prophet\" to Livingstone; the two became the best known left-wingers in Labour.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=67\u201368|2a1=Livingstone|2y=1987|2pp=90\u201391|3a1=Hosken|3y=2008|3pp=67\u201369|4a1=Turner|4y=2010|4p=32}}\n\n==Greater London Council leadership==\n{{Main|Greater London Council leadership of Ken Livingstone}}\n\n===Becoming leader of the GLC: 1979\u20131981===\nInspired by the Bennites, Livingstone planned a GLC take-over; on 18 October 1979, he called a meeting of Labour leftists entitled \"Taking over the GLC\", beginning publication of monthly newsletter the ''London Labour Briefing''.

Others stayed in their former positions, including Dave Wetzel as transport chair and Mike Ward as chair of industry; thus was created what biographer John Carvel described as \"the second Livingstone administration\", leading to a \"more calm and supportive environment\".{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=149, 195}} Turning his attention once more to Parliament, Livingstone sought to be selected as the Labour candidate for the constituency of [[Brent East (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent East]], a place which he felt an \"affinity\" for and where several of his friends lived. At the time, the Brent East Labour Party was characterised by competing factions, with Livingstone attempting to gain the support of both the hard and soft left. Securing a significant level of support from local party members, he nonetheless failed to apply for the candidacy in time, and so the incumbent centrist [[Reg Freeson]] was once more selected as Labour candidate for Brent East. A subsequent vote at the council meeting revealed that 52 local Labour members would have voted for Livingstone, with only 2 for Freeson and 3 abstentions. Nevertheless, in the [[1983 United Kingdom general election]], Freeson went on to win the Brent East constituency for Labour.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=166\u2013175|2a1=Hosken|2y=2008|2pp=174\u2013181}} In 1983, Livingstone began co-presenting a late night television chat show with [[Janet Street-Porter]] for [[London Weekend Television]].{{sfn|Carvel|1984|p=199}}\n\n====Fares Fair and transport policy====\n\nThe Greater London Labour Manifesto for the 1981 elections, although written under McIntosh's leadership, had been determined by a special conference of the London Labour Party in October 1980 in which Livingstone's speech had been decisive on transport policy. The manifesto focused on job creation schemes and cutting London Transport fares, and it was to these issues that Livingstone's administration turned.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=83\u201384|2a1=Hosken|2y=2008|2p=101}} One primary manifesto focus had been a pledge known as [[Fares Fair]], which focused on reducing [[London Underground]] fares and freezing them at that lower rate. Based on a fare freeze implemented by the [[South Yorkshire|South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council]] in 1975, it was widely considered to be a moderate and mainstream policy by Labour, which it was hoped would get more Londoners using public transport, thereby reducing congestion. In October 1981, the GLC implemented their policy, cutting London Transport fares by 32%; to fund the move, the GLC planned to increase the London [[Rates (tax)|rates]].{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=115\u2013118}}\n\nThe legality of the Fares Fair policy was challenged by Dennis Barkway, Conservative leader of the [[London Borough of Bromley]] council, who complained that his constituents were having to pay for cheaper fares on the London Underground when it did not operate in their borough. Although the Divisional Court initially found in favour of the GLC, Bromley Borough took the issue to the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]], where three judges \u2013 [[Lord Denning]], [[Peter Oliver, Baron Oliver of Aylmerton|Lord Justice Oliver]] and Lord Justice Watkins \u2013 reversed the previous decision, finding in favour of Bromley Borough on 10 November. They proclaimed that the Fares Fair policy was illegal because the GLC was expressly forbidden from choosing to run London Transport at a deficit, even if this was in the perceived interest of Londoners.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1pp=128\u2013133|2a1=Hosken|2y=2008|2pp=117\u2013118}} The GLC appealed this decision, taking the case to the [[House of Lords]]; on 17 December five Law Lords unanimously ruled in favour of Bromley Borough Council, putting a permanent end to the Fares Fair policy.{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=135\u2013136}} GLC transport chairman Dave Wetzel labelled the judges \"Vandals in Ermine\" while Livingstone maintained his belief that the judicial decision was politically motivated.{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\nInitially presenting a motion to the GLC Labour groups that they refuse to comply with the judicial decision and continue with the policy regardless, but was out-voted by 32\u201322; many commentators claimed that Livingstone had only been bluffing in order to save face among the Labour Left.{{Sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=140\u2013143}} Instead, Livingstone got on board with a campaign known as \"Keep Fares Fair\" in order to bring about a change in the law that would make the Fares Fair policy legal; an alternate movement, \"Can't Pay, Won't Pay\", accused Livingstone of being a sell-out and insisted that the GLC proceed with its policies regardless of their legality.{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=148\u2013150}} One aspect of the London Transport reforms was however maintained; the new system of [[London Underground ticketing|flat fares within ticket zones]], and the inter-modal [[Travelcard]] ticket continues as the basis of the ticketing system.{{sfn|Turner|2010|p=80}} The GLC then put together new measures in the hope of reducing London Transport fares by the more modest amount of 25%, taking them back to roughly the price that they were when Livingstone's administration took office; it was ruled legal in January 1983, and subsequently implemented.{{sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=203\u2013204}}\n\n====GLEB and nuclear disarmament====\nLivingstone's administration founded the Greater London Enterprise Board (GLEB) to create employment by investing in the industrial regeneration of London, with the funds provided by the council, its workers' pension fund and the financial markets. Livingstone later claimed that GLC bureaucrats obstructed much of what GLEB tried to achieve.{{sfnm|1a1=Carvel|1y=1984|1p=126|2a1=Livingstone|2y=1987|2pp=148\u2013149}} Other policies implemented by the Labour Left also foundered. Attempts to prevent the sale-off of GLC council housing largely failed, in part due to the strong opposition from the Conservative government.{{Sfn|Carvel|1984|pp=124\u2013126}} ILEA attempted to carry through with its promise to cut the price of [[school meals]] in the capital from 35p to 25p, but was forced to abandon its plans following legal advice that the councillors could be made to pay the surcharge and disqualified from public office.{{sfn|Carvel|1984|p=124}}\n\nThe Livingstone administration took a strong stance on the issue of [[nuclear disarmament]], proclaiming London a \"[[nuclear-free zone]]\". On 20 May 1981, the GLC halted its annual spending of \u00a31 million on nuclear war defence plans, with Livingstone's deputy, Illtyd Harrington, proclaiming that \"we are challenging... the absurd cosmetic approach to Armageddon.\" They published the names of the 3000 politicians and administrators who had been earmarked for survival in underground bunkers in the event of a nuclear strike on London. Thatcher's government remained highly critical of these moves, putting out a propaganda campaign explaining their argument for the necessity of Britain's [[Deterrence theory|nuclear deterrent]] to counter the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Hosken|2008|pp=152\u2013155}}\n\n====Egalitarian policies====\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=\"Arguing that politics had long been the near-exclusive preserve of white middle-aged men, the GLC began an attempt to open itself to representations from other groups, principally from women, the working-class, ethnic minorities and homosexuals but also from children and the elderly.

Eisenhower High School (Blue Island, Illinois)|Eisenhower High School]], and he is a 1975 graduate of [[Southern Illinois University]] in [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]]. From 1975 to 1980, he handled [[baseball]] [[play-by-play]] duties at the [[Minor League Baseball|double-A]] level for [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], [[Amarillo, Texas]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. He became the sports director at [[WBNS (AM)|WBNS]] radio in [[Columbus, Ohio]] in 1981, where he called [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] [[American football|football]] and [[Minor League Baseball|triple-A]] baseball for two seasons. He was named the [[Ohio]] \"Sportscaster of the Year\" in 1981 by the Ohio Sportscasters Association.\n\n==Seattle Mariners and Detroit Tigers==\nBeginning in 1983, Rizzs broadcast Mariners games along with [[Dave Niehaus]]. His tenure with the Mariners was only interrupted by a three-year stint from 1992 to 1994 providing game coverage of the [[Detroit Tigers]], teaming with [[Bob Rathbun]] on [[WJR]]. After the end of the 1994 season, Rizzs returned to Seattle, where he remains to this day. In 2000, Rick was named the [[Chicago]]-area sportscaster of the year by the Chicago Pitch and Hit Club.\n\nAlthough he previously broadcast Mariners games on both television and radio, Rizzs was transferred prior to the 2007 season to work exclusively on Mariners radio broadcasts. For the first three innings, he was accompanied by [[Dave Sims]], who was hired prior to the 2007 season, and for the remainder of the game he was accompanied by the late [[Dave Niehaus]] (as Sims and Niehaus switched positions after the third inning).

Eisenhower High School (Blue Island, Illinois)|Eisenhower High School]], and he is a 1975 graduate of [[Southern Illinois University]] in [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]]. From 1975 to 1980, he handled [[baseball]] [[play-by-play]] duties at the [[Minor League Baseball|double-A]] level for [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], [[Amarillo, Texas]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. He became the sports director at [[WBNS (AM)|WBNS]] radio in [[Columbus, Ohio]] in 1981, where he called [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] [[American football|football]] and [[Minor League Baseball|triple-A]] baseball for two seasons. He was named the [[Ohio]] \"Sportscaster of the Year\" in 1981 by the Ohio Sportscasters Association.\n\n==Seattle Mariners and Detroit Tigers==\nBeginning in 1983, Rizzs broadcast Mariners games along with [[Dave Niehaus]]. His tenure with the Mariners was only interrupted by a three-year stint from 1992 to 1994 providing game coverage of the [[Detroit Tigers]], teaming with [[Bob Rathbun]] on [[WJR]]. After the end of the 1994 season, Rizzs returned to Seattle, where he remains to this day. In 2000, Rick was named the [[Chicago]]-area sportscaster of the year by the Chicago Pitch and Hit Club.\n\nAlthough he previously broadcast Mariners games on both television and radio, Rizzs was transferred prior to the 2007 season to work exclusively on Mariners radio broadcasts. For the first three innings, he was accompanied by [[Dave Sims]], who was hired prior to the 2007 season, and for the remainder of the game he was accompanied by the late [[Dave Niehaus]] (as Sims and Niehaus switched positions after the third inning). Rizzs did play-by-play for the first three and one-half innings, and again in the 7th inning. In games that went to extra innings, Rizzs did the play-by-play for the even-numbered innings.\n\nWith the death of Niehaus on November 10, 2010, Rizzs became the Mariners lead radio voice.\n\nDuring the 2011-2012 seasons, Rizzs did broadcasts of Mariners baseball with rotation of guest color commentators, including former Mariners [[Dan Wilson (baseball)|Dan Wilson]] and [[Jay Buhner]], and former Mariners announcers [[Ron Fairly]], [[Ken Wilson (sportscaster)|Ken Wilson]], [[Ken Levine (TV personality)|Ken Levine]], and [[Dave Valle]].\n\nIn January 2013, it was announced that Rizzs' new radio partner is [[Aaron Goldsmith]], formerly of the [[Pawsox Radio Network]].
