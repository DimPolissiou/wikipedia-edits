It renewed interest in the warrior in Appalachia.\n\n===Music===\nA longtime fan and musician, Truman has integrated his love of music into comics and illustration. While working for Eclipse Comics, Truman included a [[Flexi disc]] recording inside ''[[Scout (comics)|Scout]]'' #19 (May 1987) that provided a soundtrack to one of the scenes in the comic. He also released an album through Eclipse Records with his band The Dixie Pistols entitled ''Marauder''. The album included a short comic book featuring the wedding of Emanuel Santanna that took place between the first series ''Scout'' and the second series ''Scout: War Shaman''.\n\nWhile writing the biography of one of his favorite guitarists, [[Carlos Santana]], for Rock-It Comics, Truman found out that the musician had been a longtime fan of his comic, ''Scout'', whose main character, Emanuel Santanna, is the namesake of the famous guitarist. Naming the characters after favorite musicians was a common convention that Truman used throughout the ''Scout'' series.\n\nTruman has also had a long relationship with the band the [[Grateful Dead]] creating artwork for CD covers, tour posters, limited-edition T-shirts and a color comics page in each issue of the ''Grateful Dead Almanac''.\n\nTruman built a recording studio in his home and while producing recording sessions for Cherokee singer/songwriter Terry Strongheart, they decided to form a new band with some of Truman's friends and Strongheart's daughter called the Terry Strongheart Band. Two CDs have been recorded, the first entitled ''Tears'' and the follow-up ''Indian School''.\n\nTruman provided illustrations for the posthumous [[Rory Gallagher]] release ''[[Kickback City]]'' (2013).<ref>{{cite journal|last= Seaman|first= Duncan|title= Album review: ''Kickback City'' by Rory Gallagher|journal= [[Yorkshire Evening Post]]|location= [[Leeds]], United Kingdom|publisher= [[Yorkshire Post Newspapers]]|date= November 29, 2013|url= http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/whats-on/music/album-review-kickback-city-by-rory-gallagher-1-6286047|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160515031018/http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/whats-on/music/album-review-kickback-city-by-rory-gallagher-1-6286047|archivedate= May 15, 2016|url-status= live|df=mdy-all|quote= Drawing on Gallagher\u2019s passion from crime novels, this triple CD comes housed in a hardback book that includes ''The Lie Factory'', a new novella by bestselling author Ian Rankin, illustrations by DC Comics graphic artist Timothy Truman and audio book version narrated by Hollywood actor Aidan Quinn.}}</ref><ref>(November 24, 2013). \"Rebus author in tribute to legend Rory\", ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'', p. 33.</ref> Truman said he first heard Gallagher's music in 1973 while a junior in high school.<ref>Dex, Robert (September 11, 2013). \"Rankin writes novella inspired by icon Rory's music \", ''[[Irish Independent]]'', p. 2.</ref>\n\nTimothy Truman is often confused with the music composer Tim Truman<ref>''Scout: War Shaman'' #14 (June 1989), where the letters page shows several examples of this</ref> who wrote the theme to ''[[Melrose Place]]'' and composed the score to ''[[Miami Vice]]'s'' final season among other important contributions to the music industry in movies and television.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Avatar Press===\n*''[[On the Far Side of the Cadillac Desert with Dead Folks|On the Far Side With Dead Folks]]'' (a, three-issue limited series with Joe R.

He also wrote nearly the entire run of ''[[Turok]]: Dinosaur Hunter'' for [[Valiant Comics]]. For the defunct science fiction imprint of DC, [[Helix (comics)|Helix]], he created ''[[The Black Lamb]]''.

It renewed interest in the warrior in Appalachia.\n\n===Music===\nA longtime fan and musician, Truman has integrated his love of music into comics and illustration. While working for Eclipse Comics, Truman included a [[Flexi disc]] recording inside ''[[Scout (comics)|Scout]]'' #19 (May 1987) that provided a soundtrack to one of the scenes in the comic. He also released an album through Eclipse Records with his band The Dixie Pistols entitled ''Marauder''. The album included a short comic book featuring the wedding of Emanuel Santanna that took place between the first series ''Scout'' and the second series ''Scout: War Shaman''.\n\nWhile writing the biography of one of his favorite guitarists, [[Carlos Santana]], for Rock-It Comics, Truman found out that the musician had been a longtime fan of his comic, ''Scout'', whose main character, Emanuel Santanna, is the namesake of the famous guitarist. Naming the characters after favorite musicians was a common convention that Truman used throughout the ''Scout'' series.\n\nTruman has also had a long relationship with the band the [[Grateful Dead]] creating artwork for CD covers, tour posters, limited-edition T-shirts and a color comics page in each issue of the ''Grateful Dead Almanac''.\n\nTruman built a recording studio in his home and while producing recording sessions for Cherokee singer/songwriter Terry Strongheart, they decided to form a new band with some of Truman's friends and Strongheart's daughter called the Terry Strongheart Band. Two CDs have been recorded, the first entitled ''Tears'' and the follow-up ''Indian School''.\n\nTruman provided illustrations for the posthumous [[Rory Gallagher]] release ''[[Kickback City]]'' (2013).<ref>{{cite journal|last= Seaman|first= Duncan|title= Album review: ''Kickback City'' by Rory Gallagher|journal= [[Yorkshire Evening Post]]|location= [[Leeds]], United Kingdom|publisher= [[Yorkshire Post Newspapers]]|date= November 29, 2013|url= http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/whats-on/music/album-review-kickback-city-by-rory-gallagher-1-6286047|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160515031018/http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/whats-on/music/album-review-kickback-city-by-rory-gallagher-1-6286047|archivedate= May 15, 2016|url-status= live|df=mdy-all|quote= Drawing on Gallagher\u2019s passion from crime novels, this triple CD comes housed in a hardback book that includes ''The Lie Factory'', a new novella by bestselling author Ian Rankin, illustrations by DC Comics graphic artist Timothy Truman and audio book version narrated by Hollywood actor Aidan Quinn.}}</ref><ref>(November 24, 2013). \"Rebus author in tribute to legend Rory\", ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'', p. 33.</ref> Truman said he first heard Gallagher's music in 1973 while a junior in high school.<ref>Dex, Robert (September 11, 2013). \"Rankin writes novella inspired by icon Rory's music \", ''[[Irish Independent]]'', p. 2.</ref>\n\nTimothy Truman is often confused with the music composer Tim Truman<ref>''Scout: War Shaman'' #14 (June 1989), where the letters page shows several examples of this</ref> who wrote the theme to ''[[Melrose Place]]'' and composed the score to ''[[Miami Vice]]'s'' final season among other important contributions to the music industry in movies and television.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Avatar Press===\n*''[[On the Far Side of the Cadillac Desert with Dead Folks|On the Far Side With Dead Folks]]'' (a, three-issue limited series with Joe R.
