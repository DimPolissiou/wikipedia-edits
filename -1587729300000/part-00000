After gaining popularity, the single was re-released by [[Columbia Records]] in March 2019. Lil Nas X also recorded a remix with American country singer [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], which was released on April 5, 2019. Both the original and remix were included on Lil Nas X's debut EP, ''[[7 (Lil Nas X EP)|7]]'' (2019).\n\nThe song has been widely labeled as \"[[country rap]]\", a genre that had not often reached the mainstream prior to its release. Dutch record producer [[YoungKio]] produced the instrumental and made it available for purchase online in 2018. It features a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] of a [[banjo]] from \"[[Ghosts I\u2013IV|34 Ghosts IV]]\" by American industrial rock band [[Nine Inch Nails]]. The sample was placed behind [[Trap music|trap]]-style [[Roland TR-808]] drums and bass. Lil Nas X purchased the instrumental for US$30 and recorded \"Old Town Road\" in one day. At the time, he had been living with his sister after dropping out of college; his real world struggles served as an influence on some of the lyrics.\n\nThe song initially gained popularity on social video sharing app [[TikTok]] and eventually entered the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] in March 2019. The song reached number 19 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Hot Country Songs]] chart before the magazine disqualified it from being included on the chart on grounds that it did not fit the genre, sparking a debate on the definition of [[country music]]. Though it was not re-entered onto the overall country charts, both the original version of the song and the remix featuring Cyrus eventually peaked at number one on the flagship ''Billboard'' chart, the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], for a [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100|record-breaking nineteen consecutive weeks]]. Internationally, one or more versions of \"Old Town Road\" have topped the national singles charts in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom; and charted within the top 10 in various other markets. \n\nThe song was awarded [[Recording Industry Association of America#\"Digital\" single certification|diamond certification]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], in October 2019, for moving ten million total units in the United States, the fastest song to be awarded diamond certification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegrapevine.theroot.com/lil-nas-x-takes-the-old-town-road-to-diamond-status-be-1839292040|title=Lil Nas X Takes the 'Old Town Road' to Diamond Status, Becomes Fastest Song Ever to Do So|last=|first=|date=|website=The Root|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 24, 2019}}</ref> The remix featuring Billy Ray Cyrus was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and won for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Music Video]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\n==Background and recording==\n[[File:Lil Nas X (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|180px|Lil Nas X (pictured) bought the beat for \"Old Town Road\" anonymously on an online store from producer YoungKio for $30.<ref name=\"BI\"/>]]\n[[Country rap]], and its subgenre, country trap, emerged onto the mainstream following American rapper [[Young Thug]]'s experimental mixtape ''[[Beautiful Thugger Girls]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"ThugSlime\"/> Lil Nas X has cited Young Thug as a pioneer of country trap.<ref name=\"TIME\"/> In May 2018, [[Lil Tracy]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]] reignited the trend with their country rap single \"Like a Farmer (Remix)\".<ref name=\"ThugSlime\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8503019/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-five-things-to-know|title=5 Things to Know About 'Old Town Road' Rapper Lil Nas X|work=Billboard|author=Michael Saponara|date=March 22, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/03/27/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-billboard-country-chart-removal|title=Billboard erases Lil Nas X's 'Old Town Road' from country music chart|website=[[The Fader]]|author=Salvatore Maicki|date=March 27, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2019|quote=Lil Nas X's hit is one of the latest entries in a storied canon of country rap, a trend reignited last year by Lil Tracy and Lil Uzi Vert's \"Like a Farmer.\"}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Lil Nas X dropped out of college to pursue a music career, but was discouraged by his parents.

December 2018. After gaining popularity, the single was re-released by [[Columbia Records]] in March 2019. Lil Nas X also recorded a remix with American country singer [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], which was released on April 5, 2019. Both the original and remix were included on Lil Nas X's debut EP, ''[[7 (Lil Nas X EP)|7]]'' (2019).\n\nThe song has been widely labeled as \"[[country rap]]\", a genre that had not often reached the mainstream prior to its release. Dutch record producer [[YoungKio]] produced the instrumental and made it available for purchase online in 2018. It features a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] of a [[banjo]] from \"[[Ghosts I\u2013IV|34 Ghosts IV]]\" by American industrial rock band [[Nine Inch Nails]]. The sample was placed behind [[Trap music|trap]]-style [[Roland TR-808]] drums and bass. Lil Nas X purchased the instrumental for US$30 and recorded \"Old Town Road\" in one day. At the time, he had been living with his sister after dropping out of college; his real world struggles served as an influence on some of the lyrics.\n\nThe song initially gained popularity on social video sharing app [[TikTok]] and eventually entered the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] in March 2019.

Based on the stories of the character [[Paddington Bear]], created by [[Michael Bond]] (to whom the film is also dedicated), it is the sequel to ''[[Paddington (film)|Paddington]]'' (2014), and is produced by [[Lucasfilm Limited]] and [[StudioCanal UK]]. The film, a American-French [[Co-production (media)|co-production]], stars [[Ben Whishaw]] as the voice of Paddington, with [[Hugh Bonneville]], [[Sally Hawkins]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], [[Julie Walters]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Peter Capaldi]], and [[Hugh Grant]] in live-action roles. In the film, Paddington tries to get a present for his aunt's birthday, but ends up being framed for a crime he did not commit.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in October 2016 and ended in June 2017. The film was theatrically released on 10 November 2017 in the United States and 6 December 2017 in France, and grossed $227 million worldwide.

It received three nominations at the [[71st British Academy Film Awards]]: [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film|Outstanding British Film]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]], for Grant.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be 400 to 700 words. -->\n[[Paddington Bear|Paddington]], having settled with the Brown family in Windsor Gardens, has become popular in his community, offering people emotional support in various ways. To purchase a unique [[pop-up book]] of London in Samuel Gruber's antique shop for his aunt Lucy's 100th birthday, Paddington performs several odd jobs and saves his wages, but the book is stolen. Paddington gives chase, but the thief escapes, and Paddington is framed and arrested. Although Gruber and the Browns do not believe that Paddington stole the book, with no evidence that the thief even existed, Paddington is convicted and sent to prison. The thief returns home and is revealed to be Phoenix Buchanan, an egotistical ex-actor who lives near the Browns.\n\nWhile in prison, Paddington befriends many of the inmates, including the short-tempered chef Knuckles, who recruits Paddington, impressed by his marmalade sandwich recipe. The Browns work to clear Paddington's name, putting up sketches of the thief. Buchanan uses the book to locate a series of clues within London's famous landmarks, which he believes will unveil the location of a secret treasure. During their efforts to prove Paddington's innocence, the Browns encounter a fortune teller who informs them that the book leads to the hidden fortune of the original author.\n\nWith Paddington inside, the prison is a much livelier place, but Paddington struggles to remain positive when the Browns are unable to prove his innocence, but keep hunting. Becoming convinced that Buchanan is the culprit, the Browns look for the stolen book inside his house. They find a secret attic where Buchanan's various costumes are stashed, including the costume of the thief. Buchanan returns home and they are forced to leave. Meanwhile, they miss a prison visit with Paddington, causing him to believe that they have forgotten about him.\n\nPaddington soon joins Knuckles, Phibs, and Spoon in a prison break who promise to aid in proving his innocence, but promptly abandon the idea in order to leave the country, inviting Paddington to join them. Paddington refuses and, while avoiding the police, uses a public telephone to contact the Browns, who assert that Buchanan is the real culprit. To catch him, they arrange to meet at Paddington Station, where a carnival train carrying the supposed location of the hidden fortune is due to leave shortly.\n\nPaddington reaches the station and boards the train just as it leaves. The Browns pursue on another steam train at the opposite platform. When caught up, Henry, Judy and Mrs. Bird board the other train and confront Buchanan, who overwhelms them and makes good his initial escape. Paddington is left stranded in the train's rear carriage, the coupling of which Buchanan severs, leaving it to crash into a nearby river. Mary tries to rescue Paddington but struggles to open the locked carriage; she is soon assisted by Knuckles and the other inmates, who have had a change of heart and decide to help Paddington as promised. Eventually, Henry knocks out Buchanan just as he tries to access the so-called treasure, and Buchanan is arrested.\n\nPaddington, now declared innocent, becomes very ill after the events, slipping into a three-day coma and waking up on Lucy's birthday. Paddington is disappointed that he cannot give Lucy the book, which was taken in as evidence, but soon discovers the Browns, with the help of various other people in the neighbourhood, made sure Lucy could come to London and see it for herself. When answering the door to her, Paddington rushes up and hugs her, wishing her a happy birthday.\n\nDuring the credits, Knuckles, Phibs, and Spoon are pardoned. Buchanan is found guilty and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Six months later, he is shown to be putting his experience as a performer to further use, hosting shows for the inmates and providing entertainment throughout the building.\n\n== Cast ==\n'''Main

(director)|Paul King]] and written by King and [[Simon Farnaby]]. Based on the stories of the character [[Paddington Bear]], created by [[Michael Bond]] (to whom the film is also dedicated), it is the sequel to ''[[Paddington (film)|Paddington]]'' (2014), and is produced by [[Heyday Films]] and [[StudioCanal UK]]. The film, a British-French [[Co-production (media)|co-production]], stars [[Ben Whishaw]] as the voice of Paddington, with [[Hugh Bonneville]], [[Sally Hawkins]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], [[Julie Walters]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Peter Capaldi]], and [[Hugh Grant]] in live-action roles. In the film, Paddington tries to get a present for his aunt's birthday, but ends up being framed for a crime he did not commit.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in October 2016 and ended in June 2017. The film was theatrically released on 10 November 2017 in the United Kingdom and 6 December 2017 in France, and grossed $227 million worldwide. It received widespread critical acclaim, and has [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|an approval rating of 100%]] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (and is, with 238 positive reviews, the highest-rated film on the site). It received three nominations at the [[71st British Academy Film Awards]]: [[BAFTA Award for Outstanding British Film|Outstanding British Film]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role|Best Actor in a Supporting Role]], for Grant.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be 400 to 700 words. -->\n[[Paddington Bear|Paddington]], having settled with the Brown family in Windsor Gardens, has become popular in his community, offering people emotional support in various ways. To purchase a unique [[pop-up book]] of London in Samuel Gruber's antique shop for his aunt Lucy's 100th birthday, Paddington performs several odd jobs and saves his wages, but the book is stolen. Paddington gives chase, but the thief escapes, and Paddington is framed and arrested. Although Gruber and the Browns do not believe that Paddington stole the book, with no evidence that the thief even existed, Paddington is convicted and sent to prison. The thief returns home and is revealed to be Phoenix Buchanan, an egotistical ex-actor who lives near the Browns.\n\nWhile in prison, Paddington befriends many of the inmates, including the short-tempered chef Knuckles, who recruits Paddington, impressed by his marmalade sandwich recipe. The Browns work to clear Paddington's name, putting up sketches of the thief. Buchanan uses the book to locate a series of clues within London's famous landmarks, which he believes will unveil the location of a secret treasure. During their efforts to prove Paddington's innocence, the Browns encounter a fortune teller who informs them that the book leads to the hidden fortune of the original author.\n\nWith Paddington inside, the prison is a much livelier place, but Paddington struggles to remain positive when the Browns are unable to prove his innocence, but keep hunting. Becoming convinced that Buchanan is the culprit, the Browns look for the stolen book inside his house. They find a secret attic where Buchanan's various costumes are stashed, including the costume of the thief. Buchanan returns home and they are forced to leave. Meanwhile, they miss a prison visit with Paddington, causing him to believe that they have forgotten about him.\n\nPaddington soon joins Knuckles, Phibs, and Spoon in a prison break who promise to aid in proving his innocence, but promptly abandon the idea in order to leave the country, inviting Paddington to join them. Paddington refuses and, while avoiding the police, uses a public telephone to contact the Browns, who assert that Buchanan is the real culprit. To catch him, they arrange to meet at Paddington Station, where a carnival train carrying the supposed location of the hidden fortune is due to leave shortly.\n\nPaddington reaches the station and boards the train just as it leaves. The Browns pursue on another steam train at the opposite platform. When caught up, Henry, Judy and Mrs. Bird board the other train and confront Buchanan, who overwhelms them and makes good his initial escape. Paddington is left stranded in the train's rear carriage, the coupling of which Buchanan severs, leaving it to crash into a nearby river. Mary tries to rescue Paddington but struggles to open the locked carriage; she is soon assisted by Knuckles and the other inmates, who have had a change of heart and decide to help Paddington as promised. Eventually, Henry knocks out Buchanan just as he tries to access the so-called treasure, and Buchanan is arrested.\n\nPaddington, now declared innocent, becomes very ill after the events, slipping into a three-day coma and waking up on Lucy's birthday. Paddington is disappointed that he cannot give Lucy the book, which was taken in as evidence, but soon discovers the Browns, with the help of various other people in the neighbourhood, made sure Lucy could come to London and see it for herself. When answering the door to her, Paddington rushes up and hugs her, wishing her a happy birthday.\n\nDuring the credits, Knuckles, Phibs, and Spoon are pardoned. Buchanan is found guilty and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Six months later, he is shown to be putting his experience as a performer to further use, hosting shows for the inmates and providing entertainment throughout the building.\n\n== Cast ==\n'''Main

It was a cup organized by both Argentine and Uruguayan Football Associations, with its last edition being contested in 1992. The first official title won by Argentina was the 1906 Copa Lipton, defeating Uruguay 2\u20130 in [[Montevideo]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesl/lipton.html Copa Lipton 1905-1992 at RSSSF]</ref> That same year, Argentina also played the [[Newton Cup]], another competition organized by both associations, earning the trophy after defeating Uruguay 2\u20131 in [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nIn the following years, matches played by the Argentine side were against South American teams only. The reasons varied from the long time the trips took to another countries by then to [[World War I]].<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7857%3Aseleccion-nacional-los-comienzos&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"AFA: los comienzos (1901-1930)\", AFA official site]</ref>\n\nArgentina would win four consecutive Newton Cups from 1907 to 1911,<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesn/newton.html Copa Newton 1906-1976 at RSSSF]</ref> and four Lipton Cups from 1906 to 1909. After some Uruguayan victories, Argentina won the 1913, 1915 and 1916 Lipton and 1916 Newton Cup trophies.\n\n[[File:Argentina_equipo_1921.jpg|thumb|right|220px|In 1921 Argentina won its first [[Copa Am\u00e9rica|South American Championship]]]]\nIn 1916, Argentina contested the first tournament organized by [[CONMEBOL]], the South American Championship (the current [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]]) hosted in Buenos Aires and [[Avellaneda]] and won by [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. The host plus Brazil, Chile and Uruguay were the only teams contesting the inaugural competition. During that tournament Argentina played three matches, defeating Chile 6\u20130 and drawing Brazil and Uruguay, who became champions on goal difference. The line-up at the final was: Isola, D\u00edaz, Reyes, Mart\u00ednez, Olazar, Badaracco, Heissinger, [[Alberto Ohaco|Ohaco]], H. Hayes, E. Hayes and [[Natalio Perinetti|Perinetti]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tables/16safull.html Southamerican Championship 1916 - RSSSF]</ref>\n\nArgentina won its first South American championship in 1921, also held in Buenos Aires. The squad won all the games disputed, defeating [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] and Uruguay to earn six points with no goals received. Notable players of that team were goalkeeper [[Am\u00e9rico Tesoriere]] and striker [[Pedro Calomino]]. Julio Libonatti was also tournament's top scorer.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tables/21safull.html Southamerican Championship 1916 - RSSSF]</ref>\n\n===The Olympic goal===\n[[File:Gololimpicodeonzari.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Onzari's olympic goal against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in 1924.]]\n\nIn 1924, Argentina played a friendly match against Uruguay at [[Sportivo Barracas]]' stadium. When only 15 minutes had been played, winger [[Ces\u00e1reo Onzari]] scored from a [[corner kick]], with no other player touching the ball before scoring. Due to the fact that Uruguay was the Olympic champion, this play was called \"Gol Ol\u00edmpico\". This denomination still remains.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2004/10/02/deportes/d-07101.htm \"El gol ol\u00edmpico cumple 80\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 2 October 2004</ref>\n\nThe goal stood since [[FIFA]] had previously regulated goals scored directly from the corner kick, as Onzari did during that match. According to ''La Naci\u00f3n'' newspaper, 52,000 fans attended the game, an Argentina 2\u20131 win, where the Uruguayan team left the field with only four minutes to play. Argentine players later complained about the rough play of the Uruguayans during the match, while their rivals also complained about the aggressiveness of local spectators, who threw bottles at them at the end of the match.<ref>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1181561-el-gol-olimpico-cumple-85-anos \"El gol ol\u00edmpico cumple 85 a\u00f1os\"], Canchallena.com, 2 October 2009</ref>\n\nIn 1925, the South American championship was hosted by third time in Argentina, and the ''Albicelest'' won its second title. The team played four matches and remained unbeaten once more, defeating Paraguay and Brazil twice each. A highmark was the 4\u20131 victory against rivals Brazil.\n\nArgentina won another consecutive title in 1927 obtaining the [[1927 South American Championship|South American championship held in Peru]]. The team made a great campaign, finishing unbeaten with three wins over three games played. The national squad achieved a large victory over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] (7\u20131), then beating Uruguay by 3\u20132 and the local team by 5\u20131 in the last match of the tournament.

The football squad reached the final after trashing the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] 11\u20132, Belgium 6\u20133 and Egypt 6\u20130.

Argentina finished unbeaten once more, defeating all its rivals in the group: [[Peru national football team|Peru]] (3\u20130), Paraguay (4\u20131) and Uruguay in the last match played in the [[Estadio Gas\u00f3metro]] of Buenos Aires. Most of players that took part of the team would play for Argentina in the first World Cup organized by FIFA one year later.\n\nArgentina was one of the 13 national teams attending to the inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]] hosted by Uruguay.\n\nIn the inaugural match of the World Cup, Argentina defeated [[France national football team|France]] 1\u20130. The national team then beat [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 6\u20133 and finished its run in the first stage by defeating [[Chile national football team|Chile]] 3\u20131. Argentina qualified to the semi-finals where the squad widely beat the United States 6\u20131. On July 30, Argentina played its first World Cup final against Uruguay, but lost 4\u20132.\n\n===1934\u201354: A long absence===\nArgentina played only one game at the next [[1934 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in Italy in 1934. The tournament format was a knockout tournament, and Argentina lost its only match 3\u20132 to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. Argentina would not participate in the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] in France, the last before [[World War II]]. The first World Cup after the War was the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] held in Brazil, but Argentina did not enter the competition due to a conflict with the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]]. For the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]] in Switzerland, Argentina refused to participate.\n\nIn 1951, Argentina played [[England national football team|England]] for the first time and were defeated 2\u20131 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. The second leg was played in Buenos Aires on 14 June 1953, where Argentina won 3\u20131, though the match caused great repercussions in Argentina.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/05/14/d-05301.htm \"Los 50 a\u00f1os del gol de Grillo a Inglaterra\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 14 May 2003</ref>\n\n===From ''Los Carasucias'' to the 1958 disaster===\n[[File:Carasucias.JPG|thumb|right|200px|''Los Carasucias'': Corbatta, Maschio, Angelillo, S\u00edvori and Cruz.]]\n\nAlthough Argentina did not contest any World Cups from 1934 to 1954, the team won the [[1937 South American Championship|1937]], [[1941 South American Championship|1941]], [[1945 South American Championship|1945]], [[1946 South American Championship|1946]], [[1947 South American Championship|1947]], [[1955 South American Championship|1955]] and [[1957 South American Championship|1957]] South American championships, all squads coached by Guillermo St\u00e1bile.\n\nThe 1957 squad is probably the most remembered team of those years because of its skilled players and exquisite style of playing showed on the field.

Argentina was finally thrashed by [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] 6\u20131, one of the worst defeats of a national team in a World Cup and being eliminated from the competition. The poor performance was called \"''El desastre de Suecia''\" (\"The Sweden disaster\").

The team thrashed Chile 6\u20131 at the debut, then beat Bolivia 2\u20130, Peru and Paraguay 3\u20131, Uruguay 4\u20131 and finished with a 1\u20131 draw against Brazil. Argentina remained unbeaten, winning five of six matches played. The team was coached by a triumvirate composed by [[Victorio Spinetto]], [[Jos\u00e9 Della Torre]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Barreiro (footballer)|Jos\u00e9 Barreiro]], replacing Guillermo St\u00e1bile after his 19-year tenure in the national team. Argentina would not win a Copa Am\u00e9rica until [[1991 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], when the team coached by [[Alfio Basile]] obtained the trophy in Chile.\n\nIn 1959, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Moreno]] became Argentina coach, although he did not spend much time with the team. Under his coaching Argentina disputed the [[1959 South American Championship (Ecuador)|Southamerican championship in Ecuador]], where the squad defeated Paraguay 4\u20132, drew the hosts 1\u20131 and suffered a large defeat by 5\u20130 at the hands of Uruguay, although the team achieved a great 4\u20131 victory against Brazil with three goals by [[Jos\u00e9 Sanfilippo]] in the last match. Once the extra tournament finished, Moreno left his place and Guillermo St\u00e1bile started his 2nd period as coach of Argentina national team.\n\nIn 1960, Argentina won its first and only [[Panamerican Championship 1960|Panamerican championship]] held in [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica]]. That same year the team suffered three losses to Brazil: two of them in the Roca Cup and the next in the Atlantic Cup. That was the last match where Argentina was coached by St\u00e1bile in his second tenure. He would be replaced by [[Victorio Spinetto]].\n\nIn 1961, Argentina started a tour across Europe, playing several matches against local national teams. The squad only achieved one victory against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] with two losses and two draws. After a short period coached by Jos\u00e9 D'Amico, [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] took over the team. Argentina made a poor performance at the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]], being defeated by England (3\u20131) to be eliminated from the tournament.\n\nIn the [[1963 South American Championship]], Argentina finished third in the tournament, although the team achieved important victories over Brazil (3\u20130), Ecuador and Colombia, but lost to Bolivia and Peru. That same year, Argentina was also defeated by Brazil in the Roca Cup.\n\n===Nation's Cup===\n[[File:Seleccion argentina 1964.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The team that won the [[Ta\u00e7a das Na\u00e7\u00f5es|Nations' Cup]] in 1964]]\nIn 1964, Argentina won the [[Ta\u00e7a das Na\u00e7\u00f5es|Nations' Cup]], a friendly tournament organized by the Brazilian Association to commemorate its 50th anniversary.

Minella left the team, being replaced by [[Osvaldo Zubeld\u00eda]] after qualification was over. [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] took over the squad, beginning his second tenure on the national side.\n\nThe national side played several friendly matches against [[Soviet Union national football team|the Soviet Union]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] before its flight to England. Argentina only drew the first two games and was defeated in the last in Torino.\n\n[[File:Argentina 1966 rattin.jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[Antonio Ratt\u00edn]] (#10) was sent off by referee Kreitlein in the match against England.]]\nArgentina made its debut in Group 2 of the World Cup, defeating [[Spain national football team|Spain]] by 2\u20131. The next matches were against West Germany, which ended 0\u20130 and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] also won by 2\u20131. Argentina qualified to the quarter-finals where the team was defeated by the host team 1\u20130. It was a controversial match where midfielder [[Antonio Ratt\u00edn]] was sent off by German referee Rudolf Kreitlein for \"violence of the tongue\", despite the referee speaking no Spanish. Ratt\u00edn was so incensed with the decision, believing the referee to be biased in favour of England, that he refused to leave. As a way to show his disgust, he sat on the red carpet exclusively meant for the Queen to walk on. He eventually had to be escorted from the field by two policemen and as a final sign of disgust, wrinkled at a British pennant before being escorted out. This incident, and others surrounding the same game, arguably started the long-lasting rivalry between both national teams, although on the other hand, allowed for the institution of yellow and red cards into football, a solution devised by FIFA after the spark that set off the incident.\n\nAlthough Argentina did not have a great performance in England, the players were well received by the crowd in Ezeiza, in part due to the incident with Ratt\u00edn and the Queen's carpet, where Ratt\u00edn himself later saying that he \"didn't know where he had sat on\".<ref name=transition>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7861%3Ala-transicion-hacia-la-organizacion&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"La transici\u00f3n hacia la organizaci\u00f3n\", AFA website: Historia de la Selecci\u00f3n Argentina]</ref>\n\nThe next step for the team was the [[1967 South American Championship|1967 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], hosted by Uruguay. Argentina made a good campaign, winning five over six matches disputed, being defeated only by the host team and finished second.\n\nDuring 1967 and 1969, the Football Association named four different coaches to the national team: Carmelo Faraone, who only coached two matches, [[Renato Cesarini]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Minella|Jos\u00e9 M. Minella]], [[Humberto Maschio]] and [[Adolfo Pedernera]]. In those years, Argentina played a series of friendly matches with most of them being South American teams and a few European teams. Argentina also played a new edition of the [[Copa Lipton|Lipton Cup]], obtaining it by goal average over Uruguay.\n\nIn 1969, Argentina began qualifying for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] under Pedernera. The national squad shared its group with Bolivia and Peru, losing the first two games played as the away team. Although Argentina won the next game (over Bolivia, 1\u20130), the 2\u20132 draw against Peru in the last fixture (played at [[La Bombonera Stadium|La Bombonera]]) allowed the Peruvian squad to be one of the South American representatives in the World Cup, eliminating Argentina.<ref name=transition/><ref>[http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/stories/classicqualifiers/news/newsid=735385.html \"El d\u00eda que Per\u00fa enmudeci\u00f3 a La Bombonera\", FIFA official site]</ref> To date, this remains the only time that Argentina has failed to qualify for a World Cup in which it entered a team.  This poor performance that caused the absence of a national representative in the 1970 World Cup is still regarded as one of Argentina's biggest frustrations in its history.<ref>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/deportes/8-40394-2004-08-31.html \"A 35 a\u00f1os de un fat\u00eddico empate contra los peruanos\", ''P\u00e1gina/12''], August 31, 2004</ref>\n\nAfter the frustration of 1969, the Association named [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Pizzuti]], who had won the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] with [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]] three years before, as coach of the national team. Pizzuti was the manager during three years, in which Argentina played several friendly games against South American teams, which included the 1971 Roca Cup title (shared with Brazil). In 1972, Argentina was invited to play the Brazil Independence Cup, where the team did not achieve good results.\n\nAfter the Independence Cup, Pizzuti was replaced by [[Omar S\u00edvori]], the most notable player of the 1957 Copa Am\u00e9rica triumph and had previous experience as manager of [[Rosario Central]] and [[Estudiantes de La Plata]]. Argentina played some friendly matches as preparation for the qualifying, with some interesting results such as a 3\u20132 over West Germany in [[Munich]].\n\n===\"The Ghost Team\" and 1974 World Cup===\nQualifying for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] began in September 1973, where Argentina shared its group with Bolivia and Paraguay. Bolivia used to play its home venues at [[La Paz]], where Argentine players suffered the lack of oxygen and other effects caused by [[altitude sickness]]. To avoid complications, S\u00edvori decide to prepare a team to play in altitude. Following his instructions, Miguel Ignomiriello took many players to [[Tilcara]] so they could become acclimatized to altitude.<ref>[http://decelesteyblanco.blogspot.com.ar/2008/03/la-seleccin-fantasma.html \"Historias Albicelestes: La Selecci\u00f3n Fantasma\" by Eduardo C\u00e1ntaro]</ref><ref>[http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/nota.php?id=209363 \"Ese equipo fantasma\", ''Diario Uno''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015173356/http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/nota.php?id=209363 |date=2013-10-15 }}, 3 April 2009</ref>\n\nArgentina won the match played in La Paz 1\u20130.

With its new coach on the bench, Argentina played only four matches before the competition, facing European teams. Argentina defeated Romania and France and drew England before suffering a defeat to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] by 4\u20131.\n\nOnce more, Argentina made a poor performance in a World Cup. They were defeated by Poland in their opening game by 3\u20132, followed by a 1\u20131 draw with Italy. In the last game of the first round, Argentina defeated [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]] 4\u20131, granting qualification to the second round of the tournament, where the team lost to the Netherlands, Brazil, ending with a 1\u20131 draw to [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]]. Argentina finished last in the group table and eighth in the overall table.\n\n===The Menotti era: Beginning of greatness===\nThe demise of the team in the World Cup forced the Association to make changes in Argentine football. David Bracuto was named president of the Football Association in 1974. He offered [[C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti]] the head coaching role of Argentina, which Menotti accepted under several conditions, one being that native players under 25 should not be sold to foreign clubs.<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7862%3Aseleccion-prioridad-numero-1&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"Selecci\u00f3n, prioridad n\u00famero uno\", AFA website]</ref>\n\nMenotti debuted on 12 October 1974 in a friendly match against [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. Argentina began a long preparation for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] which would be hosted on home soil for the very first time, playing friendly matches and tournaments. During those years, Argentina played a total of 33 matches. The year 1977 was also the international debut of [[Diego Maradona]], who played for the first time at age 16 against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. The match was held in Buenos Aires with a large victory for Argentina by 5\u20131.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/02/27/um/m-01371213.htm \"A 30 a\u00f1os del debut de Maradona en la Selecci\u00f3n\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 27 February 2007</ref>\n\nArgentina also played a new edition of Copa Am\u00e9rica, where for the first time there was no fixed venue. All matches were played throughout each country across the tournament. Argentina debuted thrashing Venezuela but lost to Brazil in the two games played (2\u20131 and 1\u20130).

Although Maradona was considered one of the best players in the world, Menotti did not include him in the definitive list for the tournament. Some sources state that the [[National Reorganization Process|Argentine military junta]] that ruled Argentina by then pushed Menotti to include River Plate's midfielder [[Norberto Alonso]] instead of Maradona, and that Menotti almost certainly knew that the prodigiously talented 17-year old would not be able to handle the immense pressure and attention in the biggest sporting event in Argentina's history.

In the second round Argentina was placed in Group 1 sharing it with Brazil, Poland and Peru. In the first game, Argentina beat Poland 2\u20130, with both goals from Mario Kempes. Next game was against South American powerhouse Brazil in which the game ended with a 0\u20130 draw. The last game was against Peru, a rival that Argentina easily defeated with a 6\u20130 win.

The game went to extra time and Mario Kempes once again gave the Argentines the lead and [[Daniel Bertoni]] added another goal which sealed the win for Argentina, which became the second South American team to win the World Cup at its home soil. Kempes was not only the most notable player of the team but also the topscorer of the tournament with six goals.\n\nAfter the success of the World Cup, Menotti continued as coach and Argentina played some friendly match as preparation for the [[1979 Copa Am\u00e9rica]].

The team, also coached by Menotti, won the tournament with Maradona and [[Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz]] as the leaders and most notable players of the squad. The tournament was also the first official championship played by Maradona in a national team.\n\nDue to Argentina needing no qualifiers to the next World Cup as holders, the national team played a series of matches as preparation for the competition. In 1980 there was no official tournaments so the team toured on Europe and also hosted friendly games in some of the most important cities of Argentina such as [[Mar del Plata]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]. Argentina played the [[1980 Mundialito]], a competition hosted by Uruguay in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the first World Cup tournament, where the team defeated West Germany and drew with Brazil to be eliminated in the first stage.\n\n===1982: End of an era and beginning of Maradona era===\n[[File:Arg1982 v Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Argentina players leaving the field after being eliminated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]].]]\n\nIn 1982 the Argentine squad travelled to Spain to participate in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] while Argentina was fighting in the [[Falklands War]] (''Guerra de Malvinas'') with the United Kingdom after the invasion of the [[Falkland Islands]] had been ordered by president [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] on April 2.\n\nThe lineup was based on the 1978 team with the addition of Diego Maradona (who had won a domestic title playing at a high level) and Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz. The squad arrived in Spain as a big favourite to win the Cup.  Argentina debuted with a 1\u20130 loss to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] at [[Camp Nou]] in [[Barcelona]]. There were internal tensions within the camp between the older and younger players, and this caused problems. Nevertheless, the team recovered by defeating Hungary (4\u20131) and  [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] (2\u20130) therefore qualifying for the next stage. In the second round, Argentina shared a group with Italy and Brazil, being defeated by both (3\u20131 and 2\u20131) and eliminated from the championship. Maradona could not show his skills during the tournament, suffering from the rough play of rivals (especially [[Claudio Gentile]] in the game against Italy). He would eventually be sent off by the referee after kicking Brazilian player [[Jo\u00e3o Batista da Silva|Batista]] in the groin.<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7863%3Auna-alegria-y-un-golpe-inesperado&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"Una alegr\u00eda y un golpe inesperado (1979/1982)\", AFA official website]</ref><ref>[http://www.marca.com/reportajes/2010/04/espana_1982/2010/04/19/seccion_01/1271693378.html \"Maradona fue mundialista por primera vez en Espa\u00f1a\" by Javier Estepa], ''Marca''</ref>\n\nOther players that formed the squad were [[Juan Barbas]], [[Gabriel Calder\u00f3n]] (from the 1979 youth championship-winning team), [[Patricio Hern\u00e1ndez]], [[Julio Olarticoechea]], [[Enzo Trossero]] and [[Jorge Valdano]].\n\nThe failure at the World Cup caused Menotti to leave his post. Despite the poor performances, the national team achieved two world titles (senior and youth) during the nine years with Menotti as coach.

Bilardo was famous for his perfectionism and obsession with tactic and strategy of the game, which called the attention as much as followers as critics. The Bilardo era began in May 1983 with a 2\u20132 draw with Chile in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. Soon after Argentina played the [[1983 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], the first official tournament with Bilardo. The squad was eliminated on first round with 3 draws (2 with [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] and a 0\u20130 with Brazil), winning its only match 1\u20130 to Brazil in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe team was formed by footballers playing in domestic [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] exclusively, being some of them goalkeepers [[Ubaldo Fillol]] and [[Nery Pumpido]], defenders [[N\u00e9stor Clausen]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]], [[Enzo Trossero]], [[Julio Olarticoechea]] and [[Roberto Mouzo]]; midfielders [[Claudio Marangoni]], [[Jorge Burruchaga]], [[Alejandro Sabella]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ponce]]; forwards [[Ricardo Gareca]], [[Alberto M\u00e1rcico]].\n\nAfter the Copa Am\u00e9rica, Argentina travelled to [[Calcuta]] to play the Nehru Cup, then playing a series of friendly matches before the qualifiers to [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in Mexico. The team made a successful tour on Europe where it won the three matches disputed, including a 3\u20131 against West Germany in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. In May 1985, Argentina played its first qualifying match against [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]], winning 3\u20132. Argentina won three consecutive games, to Colombia (3\u20131 home, 1\u20130 away) and Venezuela (3\u20130 home) but lost to Peru 1\u20130 in [[Lima]] in a match where Peru midfielder [[Claudio Reyna]] marked Maradona with excessive roughness, although he was not sent off by the referee.<ref>[http://tn.com.ar/deportes/hazanas/a-27-anos-de-la-marca-personal-a-maradona-reyna-sigue-siendo-idolo-en-peru_270462 \"A 27 a\u00f1os de la marca personal a Maradona\"], [[Todo Noticias|TN]], 10 September 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.terra.com/espdep/articulo/html/fox239751.htm \"Maradona no olvida a Luis Reyna\"], ''[[Terra Networks|Terra]]'', 4 May 2006</ref>\n\nArgentina played the last match of the qualifiers against Peru in Buenos Aires.

Some journalists also accused Bilardo to play defensively, leaving behind the historic Argentine landmark of short passes and dribblings according to their point of view. ''[[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|Clar\u00edn]]'', the most popular newspaper of Argentina, was one of the hardest opponents of the coach, and Bilardo himself declared that Clar\u00edn called Association President [[Julio Grondona]] to ask him to fire the coach.<ref name=eltiempo>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1508493-bilardo-el-tiempo-me-dio-la-razon \"Bilardo: El tiempo me dio la raz\u00f3n\" - CanchaLlena.com], 19 September 2012</ref>\n\nBefore the World Cup, Argentina toured Europe losing to [[France national football team|France]] (one of the favorites to win the Cup) and [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and largely defeating [[Israel national football team|Israel]] by 7\u20132.<ref>[http://muyfutbol.com/35227/equipos-historicos-argentina-campeon-del-mundo-1986-la-angustia-que-precedio-a-la-gloria/ \"Argentina campe\u00f3n del Mundo 1986, la angustia que precedi\u00f3 a la gloria\", Muy Futbol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025231603/http://muyfutbol.com/35227/equipos-historicos-argentina-campeon-del-mundo-1986-la-angustia-que-precedio-a-la-gloria/ |date=2012-10-25 }}, 27 June 2012</ref>\n\n===1986: Return to glory===\n[[File:Argentina x corea 1986.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The team that debuted v.

Argentina was placed in Group A alongside Italy, [[Bulgarian national football team|Bulgaria]], and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. In the first game, Argentina was able to beat South Korea 3\u20131. The second match was against Italy, a tougher opponent. Italy took the lead in the sixth minute but Diego Maradona responded with a goal in the 34th minute. The game later ended with a 1\u20131 draw. The last group game was against Bulgaria, which resulted in a 2\u20130 Argentina win; therefore Argentina passed to the next round being the first in the group.\n\n{{Quote box|align=left|width=30%|quote=My daughter Daniela could not be called by her last name.

The hot-tempered game ended in a 1\u20130 win for Argentina. Next, Argentina moved on to the quarter-finals, playing England at the [[Estadio Azteca]] in [[Mexico City]]. The game started very evenly, with both teams getting chances to score but none were able to finish. The first half ended with Argentina having the majority of possession but unable to get past a tough defense. Six minutes following the second half, Maradona scored a [[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup)#The \"Hand of God\"|controversial goal]] in which he used his hand; once the match finished, Maradona called it \"''la mano de Dios''\" (\"the hand of God\"), explicitly admitting the infringement. The goal began with a defensive error from [[Steve Hodge]], who passed the ball incorrectly back to his goalkeeper, [[Peter Shilton]]. At that time, Maradona was still continuing his run and reached the ball first and netted it in with his left fist. After the goal, Maradona encouraged his teammates to embrace the goal so the referee would allow it. Four minutes after the \"hand of God\" goal, Maradona scored a goal which people{{Who|date=March 2015}} called \"The Goal of the Century\" because of the individual effort of Maradona, who starting his run from the half-way line, passed four English midfielders (he beat midfielder [[Terry Butcher]] twice) and dribbled around Shilton, finally scoring the goal which allowed Argentina to win the match, 2\u20131. That victory was very celebrated due to not only the rivalry between both teams but Argentina had lost the Falklands War at the hands of the [[British Army]] four years prior.<ref>[http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=392/index.html \"La magia de Maradona tumba a Inglaterra\" - FIFA.es]</ref>\n\n[[File:Maradona cup azteca.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Diego Maradona raising the FIFA World Cup trophy at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City.]]\nIn the semi-finals, Argentina defeated Belgium 2\u20130 at the Estadio Azteca to advance to the [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] against West Germany. Argentina won a game played at the Azteca in which the squad won its second World Cup title. [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]] opened the scoring for Argentina, then the team increased the lead with a goal by [[Jorge Valdano]]. Germany started a comeback with goals from [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]] and [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]], which evened the game at 2\u20132. [[Jorge Burruchaga]] scored the winning goal in the 83rd minute, giving Argentina a 3\u20132 victory over Germany.\n\nArgentina remained unbeaten in the World Cup, winning five over six matches disputed.

The line-up in the final was: [[Nery Pumpido]], Brown, [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuciuffo]], Ruggeri, [[Julio Olarticoechea]]; [[Ricardo Giusti]], [[Sergio Batista]], Enrique, Burruchaga; Maradona, Valdano.\n\n===1987\u20131990===\nAfter winning the World Cup, the players went on vacation and Argentina did not play a match until 1987, when a new edition of Copa Am\u00e9rica was contested. The tournament changed its format, returning to a unique host where Argentina was chosen. Argentine formed a team with a mix of players from European and local leagues. The squad debuted with a 1\u20131 draw against Per\u00fa, then beat Ecuador 3\u20130. In the second stage, Argentina lost to Uruguay (which would be the champion) 1\u20130 in Buenos Aires and was eliminated. At the end of 1987, Argentina played West Germany (the rival of the 1986 final) winning 1\u20130 at the [[Estadio Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani]]. In 1988, the squad played the Four Nations Cup, losing to the Soviet Union (4\u20132) and West Germany (1\u20130).\n\nArgentina immediately went to Australia to contest the Australia Bicentennial Gold Cup, where the team did not have a good performance, with one win against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] and a large defeat by [[Australia national soccer team|the local team]] (4\u20131).\n\nBack to Argentina, the team started its preparation for the [[1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], held in Brazil. Argentina qualified to the second round after beating Chile and Uruguay (both 1\u20130) and two draws with Ecuador and Bolivia (both 0\u20130). In the second stage, Argentina lost to Brazil and Uruguay (both 2\u20130) and only drew with Paraguay (0\u20130). Argentina was eliminated without winning a game and with no goals scored on this round. Some players of the team were Pumpido, Brown, Ruggeri, Clausen, Cuciuffo, Burruchaga, Maradona, Enrique, Giusti (all of them world champions in 1986), [[Claudio Caniggia]], [[Abel Balbo]], [[Luis Islas]], [[Roberto Sensini]], [[Gabriel Calder\u00f3n]], [[N\u00e9stor Gorosito]] and [[Pedro Troglio]].\n\n===1990: Finalist again===\nArgentina went to the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] with no qualifiers needed as being the previous champion. Prior to the World Cup, the national team played some several matches with no good results: Argentina lost to Mexico (0\u20132) and Scotland (0\u20132), winning just one of the five games played (to Israel, chosen again to be the last rival before the tournament as it had been four years before). In addition, Jorge Valdano (one of the most important players during the 1986 World Cup) trained hard in order to be in good physical condition for the Cup, but Bilardo decided not to include him in the definitive list of players. To that, Valdano said, \"I swam through the ocean but I drowned at the shore.\" In addition to Valdano not playing, a number of other important players were injured, so Argentina resorted to cynical tactics on the field, as they knew they could not win easily in a straight fight.<ref>[http://www.elespectador.com/deportes/futbolinternacional/articulo-378474-dos-anos-seleccion-colombia-tendra-un-gran-equipo Interview to Valdano] at Colombian newspaper ''[[El Espectador]]'', 30 September 2012</ref>\n\nArgentina finally debuted at the inaugural match at the [[San Siro]] in [[Milan]], being defeated by [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] (1\u20130).

Napoli|Napoli]] in the [[Serie A]]. The team qualified to the second round, where they faced Brazil at the [[Stadio delle Alpi]] in [[Turin]]. In a match where Brazil played much better than Argentina, with forwards [[M\u00fcller (footballer)|M\u00fcller]] and [[Careca]] repeatedly shooting to the goal but missing the target (the ball clashed Argentina's posts a couple of times, while Goycoechea stopped other shots) Argentina (with Maradona in bad physical condition) resisted Brazilian offensive movements during the first half, which ended 0\u20130. In the second half, Brazil was not so persistent as it had been during the first 45 minutes, so Argentina took advantage of the situation. With nine minutes till full-time, Maradona took the ball in the centre of the field, dribbled past three opponents and made a precise pass to winger [[Claudio Caniggia]], who advanced with the ball to a goal after dribbling around goalkeeper [[Cl\u00e1udio Taffarel]]. Argentina won the match 1\u20130, eliminating its arch-rival in a World Cup for the first time. That match is still regarded by the media and fans as one of the most remarkable moments of an Argentina national team.<ref>[http://www.mundialsudafrica.com/partidos-memorables-argentina-1-brasil-0-italia-1990/ \"Partidos memorables: Argentina 1-Brasil 0\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.goal.com/es-ar/slideshow/375/1/cinco-victorias-memorables-sobre-brasil \"Cinco victorias memorables sobre Brasil\" by Jonatan Fabbian at Goal.com]</ref>\n\nFor their quarter-final match in [[Florence]], Argentina narrowly eliminated [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in an exciting [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]],<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/01/sports/world-cup-90-argentina-beats-yugoslavia.html \"Argentina beats Yugoslavia\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 July 1990</ref> with Goycoechea becoming a hero after stopping three penalty kicks, including the last two.<ref name=goyco>[http://playfutbol.infobae.com/notas/676284-Nacia-Sergio-Goycochea-el-gran-heroe-de-los-penales-en-Italia-1990.html \"Nac\u00eda Sergio Goycochea, el gran h\u00e9roe de los penales en Italia 1990\", Play Futbol], 17 October 2012</ref> Maradona also missed a penalty kick, a rare occurrence; at one point Argentina were behind the Yugoslavs, but Goycoechea's outstanding goalkeeping kept Argentina in the tournament.\n\n[[File:Argentina vs italy worldcup.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The squad that beat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Napoli]], qualifying for the final.]]\nArgentina advanced to semi-finals where it to play against Italy in Naples.

Nevertheless, Argentina made its best performance in the World Cup and the match ended 1\u20131 after 90 minutes. With zero goals in extra time, the game went to a penalty shootout where Goycoechea was the hero again, stopping the shots from [[Aldo Serena]] and [[Roberto Donadoni]] to send Argentina to its second-straight World Cup final.\n\nFor the final in Rome, Argentina played West Germany, coached by former player [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. Caniggia was suspended for one game after receiving a yellow card in the match against Italy so he could not play the final. Germany arrived to the final as a wide favorite to take the Cup, as the squad had showed an effective and precise playing style, unlike Argentina which (with the exception of the game with Italy) had not had good previous performances. In addition, German footballers were in good condition while the Argentine players came to the final with several injuries, including Maradona. The game proved to be violent, brutal and bad tempered, particularly from the Argentines. Nevertheless, Germany only could score a goal at 83 minutes for a doubtful punishment by Mexican referee [[Edgardo Codesal]], who awarded Germany a penalty kick for what he thought was a foul by Roberto Sensini against Rudi V\u00f6ller. The call was controversial, and it was heavily debated by the Argentinian players.

Argentina first eliminated Brazil for the second-straight time, (6\u20135 via penalty shootout after a 1\u20131 draw), then Colombia the same way (6\u20135 [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|p.s.]]), arriving to the final game against Mexico, which the national team won 2\u20131, with two goals from Batistuta. Argentina achieved its 14th title, winning only two matches in normal time, the rest either in extra time or penalties.<ref>[http://www.geofutbol.com/2008/11/19/final-copa-america-1993-argentina-2-1-mexico/ \"Final Copa Am\u00e9rica 1993\", GeoFutbol]</ref> This is the last Copa Am\u00e9rica Argentina has won to date.<ref>[http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/2011/07/04/nota276212.html \"La \u00faltima Copa Am\u00e9rica para Argentina: 1993\", Diario Uno] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202233631/http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/2011/07/04/nota276212.html |date=2013-12-02 }}, 4 July 2011</ref>\n\nSome of the players that took part in the squad were Goycochea, Ruggeri, Batistitua, Franco, Simeone, [[Fernando Redondo]] and [[Luis Islas]].\n\n===A second \"disaster\" in 1993===\nImmediately after the Copa Am\u00e9rica, Argentina had to play the qualifiers for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], held in the United States. The team shared group with Colombia, Paraguay and Peru. Argentina won the first two as visitor to Peru (1\u20130 in Lima) and Paraguay (3\u20131 in [[Asunci\u00f3n]]) but lost to Colombia 2\u20131 in [[Barranquilla]]. In Buenos Aires, Argentina defeated Peru 2\u20131, drew with Paraguay 0\u20130 and suffered a catastrophic loss to Colombia 5\u20130 on 5 September 1993 in the Estadio Monumental. It became the largest defeat to a national team since a 1\u20136 result in the 1958 World Cup. Colombia, with great players such as [[Carlos Valderrama]], [[Freddy Rinc\u00f3n]], [[Faustino Asprilla]] and [[Leonel \u00c1lvarez (footballer, born 1965)|Leonel \u00c1lvarez]] not only won the qualifiers unbeaten, but sent Argentina to play against the representative of [[Oceania]] to get a place for the World Cup.<ref>[http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/0000/00/00/C-995-colombia-93.php \"Colombia 93\"], ''[[El Gr\u00e1fico]]''</ref>\n\nThe most important sports magazine of Argentina, ''[[El Gr\u00e1fico]]'', went into \"mourning\" with a completely black cover with the only legend: \"''Verg\u00fcenza''\" (\"Shame\") that expressed the deception and humiliation after the defeat.<ref>[http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/edicion_impresa.php?fh=1&tipo_edicion=1#anchorTapa ''El Gr\u00e1fico'' #3857, 7 September 1993]</ref><ref>[http://damepelota.wordpress.com/2008/09/05/15-argentina0-colombia5/ \"A 15 a\u00f1os de Argentina 0-Colombia 5\" by Pablo Lisotto], 5 September 2008</ref>\n\nArgentina had to play two knockout games against Australia to earn a place at the World Cup. Basile asked Maradona to return to the national squad so the team needed him to qualify to the Cup. Maradona agreed and he flew to [[Sydney]] with the rest of the team.<ref>[http://playfutbol.infobae.com/notas/671999-Basile-le-pedia-al-10-volver-a-la-Seleccion-para-clasificar-al-Mundial-94.html \"Basile le ped\u00eda al '10' volver a la Selecci\u00f3n\", PlayFutbol], 23 September 2012</ref> Argentina played the first game on 31 October 1993 which ended 1\u20131. The second match was in Buenos Aires, where the national team won 1\u20130 (Batistuta) qualifying for the World Cup.<ref>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/deportes/8-168711-2011-05-24.html \"Un caf\u00e9 veloz y a la Justicia\"], ''[[P\u00e1gina/12]]'', 24 May 2011</ref>\n\n===Another hard time: USA '94===\nArgentina played several friendly matches as preparation for the World Cup. The team lost to Brazil 0\u20132 but beat [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] 3\u20131 at [[Salta]] and smashed Israel 3\u20130 in [[Ramat Gan]]. Argentina debuted in the championship thrashing [[Greece national football team|Greece]] 4\u20130 in [[Boston]], with a hat-trick by Batistuta. Maradona also scored the third goal for Argentina, which would be his last goal in a World Cup. The national team played its second match against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] again in Boston, which defeated by 2\u20131 (2 goals by Caniggia). At the end of the match, Argentina became a favorite to win the tournament, due to the attacking playing style showed by the squad (playing with four forwards), the number of goals scored and the good performances of some of its players such as Redondo, Caniggia, Batistuta, and even the aging Maradona, who looked in great shape and scored a gem of a goal.\n\nAt the end of the match against Nigeria, Maradona was called for the drug test, which gave positive results for [[ephedrine]], a banned substance. The impact and repercussion of the news were immediate, and Maradona was expelled from the tournament and suspended for 15 months by [[FIFA]].<ref>[http://soccerlens.com/doping-in-football/19458/ \"Doping in football\" by Victor Li on SoccerLens.com], 6 January 2009</ref>\n\nWith the team still hurt after losing its leader, Argentina was defeated by Bulgaria in the sweltering heat of [[Dallas]] for their last match of the first round. The team qualified to the knockout phase, where they were beaten by Romania 3\u20132 in [[Los Angeles]]; Basile decided not to include Caniggia in this match after he was benched during the 27th minute of the Bulgaria match. After the successes of 1986 and 1990, Argentina was eliminated in the second round. Although eliminated in the second round; in an [[ESPN]] interview with [[Quique Wolff]], Maradona called the 1994 squad the greatest Argentina team of all time.\n\n===1998 World Cup===\nWith Maradona officially retired, Argentina went into the tournament with high expectations, still fielding players from their previous tournament, with Gabriel Batistuta still a constant goalscoring threat and Diego Simeone remaining as the leading figure from the anchorman position. Drawn into Group H of the competition, their opponents consisted of [[Japan national football team|Japan]], [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] and [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. They began their campaign with a 1\u20130 victory over the Asian nation, following it up with a 5\u20130 demolition of the Caribbeans.  Their third group game was against the Croatians, who had also confirmed qualification to the next round and ended with victory for the ''Albiceleste'' by 1\u20130.\n\nArgentina went into the knockout phase with the impressive record of seven goals scored, keeping clean sheets in all three group games.  Their opponent was England]], fielding an equally strong team. Argentina took the lead with just six minutes played through Gabriel Batistuta from the penalty spot, only for [[Alan Shearer]] to equalize through the same means four minutes later. Six minutes after, youngster [[Michael Owen]] broke past [[Roberto Ayala]] to score a great individual effort, which was eventually cancelled out one minute into stoppage time after a free kick routine put [[Javier Zanetti]] through on goal to score, leaving the final result at 2\u20132 at the end of the first half.\n\nIn the second half, England playmaker [[David Beckham]] was sent off after a kick on Simeone, with the scores remaining unchanged until the end of normal time and extra time.  Argentina won 4\u20133 on penalties, after Ayala scored the decisive spot kick to book their quarter-final spot, where the Netherlands awaited them.\n\nThe game was an equally fought match, with both sides scoring early goals; [[Patrick Kluivert]] netting after just 12 minutes and [[Claudio L\u00f3pez (footballer)|Claudio L\u00f3pez]] equalizing five minutes later.  Argentina held an advantage as the Dutch went a man down with the dismissal of [[Arthur Numan]] after his second booking for a foul on Simeone, though they were unable to take the opportunity and break the deadlock before they too went a man down; with [[Ariel Ortega]] receiving two successive yellow cards, the first one for diving inside the penalty box, with the second coming after headbutting Dutch goalkeeper [[Edwin van der Sar]]. Argentina's defence held tightly as extra-time beckoned, until a long aerial ball from Dutch captain [[Frank de Boer]] found [[Dennis Bergkamp]], who maneuvered around Ayala and beat the Argentine goalkeeper Roa to send the Dutch through, eliminating Argentina from the competition.\n\n===2006 World Cup===\nArgentina had been eliminated at the group stage at Korea/Japan [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], although they had been among the pre-tournament favorites. There was a high expectation of a better performance in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] in Germany. Argentina qualified for the knockout stages with wins over the Ivory Coast (2\u20131) and [[Serbia national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]] (6\u20130), and a 0\u20130 draw with the Netherlands.\n\nIn the round of 16, Argentina defeated Mexico 2\u20131 in extra-time, the winning goal scored by [[Maxi Rodr\u00edguez]]; this goal went on to win an online poll organized by FIFA as the best goal of the World Cup.<ref>http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/bgt.html</ref>  In the quarter-final, they lost 4\u20132 in penalties against hosts Germany after a 1\u20131 draw. A brawl erupted between the Argentines and Germans after the game ended; unused substitute [[Leandro Cufr\u00e9]] was sent off for kicking [[Per Mertesacker]], while Maxi Rodr\u00edguez hit [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] from behind. Following an investigation of video evidence, FIFA issued four-and two-game suspensions for Cufre and Rodr\u00edguez respectively. Germany's [[Torsten Frings]] was also suspended for the semi-final match for punching [[Julio Ricardo Cruz|Julio Cruz]].\n\nShortly after the elimination, coach [[Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman]] resigned from his position. The AFA appointed Alfio Basile, who had previously managed the national side during the 1994 World Cup, as his successor.\n\n===2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nArgentina won all three games in the group stage, beating the United States, Colombia and Paraguay. After convincing victories over Peru and Mexico in the quarter-final and semi-final, respectively, they were favorites to beat Brazil in the final, but were defeated 3\u20130.\n\n===2010 World Cup===\n[[File:Messi Podolski Di Maria 2010.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Lionel Messi]] carries out the ball, followed by [[Lukas Podolski]] in the quarter-finals of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].]]\n\nPrior to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], [[Diego Maradona]] was appointed head coach. During the qualification process, he oversaw a 6\u20131 defeat to [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] in [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]], and after a string of losses and draws, Argentina came dangerously close to failing to qualify, but victories in the last two matches secured qualification for the final tournament. In the final tournament itself, Argentina was placed in Group B, winning all their games. Their first game was against Nigeria, where Argentina netted a goal in the sixth minute to ensure a 1\u20130 victory. In the second match, against [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]], a [[Gonzalo Higua\u00edn]] hat-trick and a Korean own goal finished the score at 4\u20131. Argentina's last group game was against Greece, a 2\u20130 victory.\n\nArgentina then advanced to the round of 16 to play Mexico. The game started with controversy when [[Carlos Tevez]] headed a ball from [[Lionel Messi]] for a goal; replay clearly showed that Tevez was in an offside position. Eventually, Argentina beat Mexico 3\u20131 to advance to the quarter-finals. In a much-hyped game, Argentina was shocked after Germany eliminated them with a 4\u20130 win. [[Thomas M\u00fcller]] opened the scoring in the third minute, with [[Miroslav Klose]] adding an additional two and [[Arne Friedrich]] one.\n\n===2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\n[[File:Argentine - Portugal - Argentine.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Argentina line-up at a friendly match against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[Geneva]], February 2011.]]\n\nThe [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] was the first major tournament for new coach [[Sergio Batista]]. Argentina started the tournament with a shocking 1\u20131 tie against underdogs Bolivia. In their second game, they played a goalless draw against Colombia in [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], but went on to win their third game 3\u20130 against underdogs [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. Argentina was to play Uruguay in the quarter-finals. After going down after five minutes to a [[Diego P\u00e9rez (footballer)|Diego P\u00e9rez]] goal, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn equalized in the 17th minute. The score remained unchanged and after extra time, Argentina lost 5\u20134 in penalties with a miss from Carlos Tevez. After the elimination, Batista was sacked and replaced by former [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] coach [[Alejandro Sabella]].\n\n===2014 World Cup===\nArgentina qualified for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] and were drawn into Group F alongside Nigeria, [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and debutants [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Argentina had beaten all three of those teams, easily making it through to the next round. In the next round, they beat [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 1\u20130 after a goalless 90 minutes. In the quarter-finals, they beat Belgium, also 1\u20130 through an early goal. They then beat the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] 4\u20132 from a penalty shootout in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], but lost to eventual winners Germany in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] at the [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], concluding the World Cup runners-up.\n\n===2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nArgentina entered the subsequent tournament, the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] as heavy favorites to take home the trophy. They began their group stage against Paraguay, where after leading 2\u20130 for most of the match ultimately settled for a 2\u20132 draw. Despite doubts in defence, they overcame the difficulties to beat fellow tournament favorites Uruguay and Jamaica. Their quarter-final opponent was Colombia, whose sturdy defense was impossible to break through and goalkeeper [[David Ospina]] making impressive saves to keep the game tied at 0\u20130. In penalties, Argentina missed several chances until Carlos Tevez, who was the sole player to miss his spot kick during the previous tournament, netted his attempt to send ''la Albiceleste'' through to the semi-finals to face Paraguay.  The game was evenly played until half-time, when the score was 2\u20131 to Argentina, but four more goals during the second half allowed Argentina to cruise to the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica Final|final]], where they met host nation Chile.\n\nThe final was a hotly contested match, with both sides having great chances to open the scoring, particularly with a powerful shot from [[Sergio Ag\u00fcero]] in the first half for Argentina, with [[Alexis S\u00e1nchez]] having a clear one for Chile in the second half. With the scores still tied at the end of regulation, the match went to penalties. Only captain Lionel Messi netted his penalty attempt, with Gonzalo Higua\u00edn sending his attempt well over the crossbar and [[\u00c9ver Banega]] having his shot saved by [[Claudio Bravo (footballer)|Claudio Bravo]] to leave the final scoreline at 4\u20131 in penalties.\n\n===Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario===\nOnce more, Argentina entered the tournament as heavy favorites to take home the trophy after 22 years of international drought. ''La Albiceleste'' cruised through their group, with their opening match being a replay of the Copa Am\u00e9rica final from the year before against trophy holders Chile, which Argentina would go on to win 2\u20131. Further victories against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] and Bolivia allowed them to top the group with the maximum number of points. Their quarter-final match was against surprise side Venezuela, where the match remained even for both sides before the Argentines won 4\u20131. They then dispatched hosts United States 4\u20130 to earn yet another [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario Final|final]] clash against Chile.\n\nAs previously, it was an even match, with Chile initially having the upper hand and more possession before going a man down, with [[Marcelo D\u00edaz]] being dismissed after obstructing Messi on the ball. This, however, made it more difficult for Argentina to break through their defence, and they too would go a man down not long after with [[Marcos Rojo]] receiving a straight red card for a tackle on [[Arturo Vidal]]. Once again the match finished 0\u20130 and went to penalties. Although [[Sergio Romero]] saved Vidal's penalty kick, Messi shot his attempt over the crossbar, with the subsequent players netting their attempts until Bravo saved from [[Lucas Biglia]] and [[Francisco Silva]] netted the final penalty to once again hand Chile the trophy. The defeat caused frustration within the Argentine players, with Messi announcing his retirement from international football not long after, as well as many others suggesting their departure from the national team as well.\n\n===2018 World Cup===\nOn 20 May 2017, the [[Argentine Football Association]] announced that [[Jorge Sampaoli]] would take over as the new national team manager, officially on 1 June 2017. Sampaoli's first game in charge was a friendly match against [[Brazil]] on 9 June in Australia, with Argentina winning 1\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2017/04/21/internacional/1492798205_460690.html\n|title= Sampaoli ser\u00e1 presentado con Argentina el 22 de mayo|date= 4 April 2017|work=Diario AS|accessdate= 20 May 2017|language=es}}</ref> However, Argentina struggled during the qualifiers, and it took a [[Lionel Messi]] hat trick at Ecuador to confirm qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/lionel-messi-argentina-win-world-cup-qualify-ecuador-hat-trick-russia-2018-latest-a7993841.html|title=Lionel Messi burnishes legacy with hat-trick as Argentina come from behind to beat Ecuador and book World Cup place|date=11 October 2017|work=The Independent|publisher=ESI Media|author=Miguel Delaney}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 March 2018, in a warm-up preparation friendly match, Argentina, without its captain Messi, who was sidelined for the match due to an injury, was routed 6-1 by 2010 World Cup champion [[Spain national football team|Spain]] at the [[Wanda Metropolitano]] stadium in [[Madrid]]. It was Spain's biggest win over another previous World Cup champion, and Argentina's biggest loss since their 6\u20131 loss to Bolivia in 2009, and also tied the record for Argentina's biggest loss overall, by a margin of five goals.<ref>{{cite news |title=Spain's mauling of Argentina equals record Albiceleste defeat |url=https://en.as.com/en/2018/03/28/football/1522233313_446145.html |newspaper=[[AS (newspaper)|AS]] |date=28 March 2018 |access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 May 2018, Sampaoli announced a 35-man preliminary squad for the 2018 World Cup, and the final squad list was released on 21 May 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/icardi-cut-from-argentinas-23-man-world-cup-squad/lo0f6fig55ih1jh7w9v4enau6 |title=Icardi cut from Argentina's 23-man World Cup squad |publisher=Goal.com |date=21 May 2018 |accessdate=21 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen the World Cup in Russia came around, the tournament was a disaster for the ''Albiceleste''.

It was a cup organized by both Argentine and Uruguayan Football Associations, with its last edition being contested in 1992. The first official title won by Argentina was the 1906 Copa Lipton, defeating Uruguay 2\u20130 in [[Montevideo]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesl/lipton.html Copa Lipton 1905-1992 at RSSSF]</ref> That same year, Argentina also played the [[Newton Cup]], another competition organized by both associations, earning the trophy after defeating Uruguay 2\u20131 in [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nIn the following years, matches played by the Argentine side were against South American teams only. The reasons varied from the long time the trips took to another countries by then to [[World War I]].<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7857%3Aseleccion-nacional-los-comienzos&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"AFA: los comienzos (1901-1930)\", AFA official site]</ref>\n\nArgentina would win four consecutive Newton Cups from 1907 to 1911,<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesn/newton.html Copa Newton 1906-1976 at RSSSF]</ref> and four Lipton Cups from 1906 to 1909.

The host plus Brazil, Chile and Uruguay were the only teams contesting the inaugural competition. During that tournament Argentina played three matches, defeating Chile 6\u20130 and drawing Brazil and Uruguay, who became champions on goal difference. The line-up at the final was: Isola, D\u00edaz, Reyes, Mart\u00ednez, Olazar, Badaracco, Heissinger, [[Alberto Ohaco|Ohaco]], H. Hayes, E. Hayes and [[Natalio Perinetti|Perinetti]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tables/16safull.html Southamerican Championship 1916 - RSSSF]</ref>\n\nArgentina won its first South American championship in 1921, also held in Buenos Aires. The squad won all the games disputed, defeating [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] and Uruguay to earn six points with no goals received. Notable players of that team were goalkeeper [[Am\u00e9rico Tesoriere]] and striker [[Pedro Calomino]]. Julio Libonatti was also tournament's top scorer.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tables/21safull.html Southamerican Championship 1916 - RSSSF]</ref>\n\n===The Olympic goal===\n[[File:Gololimpicodeonzari.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Onzari's olympic goal against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in 1924.]]\n\nIn 1924, Argentina played a friendly match against Uruguay at [[Sportivo Barracas]]' stadium. When only 15 minutes had been played, winger [[Ces\u00e1reo Onzari]] scored from a [[corner kick]], with no other player touching the ball before scoring. Due to the fact that Uruguay was the Olympic champion, this play was called \"Gol Ol\u00edmpico\". This denomination still remains.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2004/10/02/deportes/d-07101.htm \"El gol ol\u00edmpico cumple 80\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 2 October 2004</ref>\n\nThe goal stood since [[FIFA]] had previously regulated goals scored directly from the corner kick, as Onzari did during that match. According to ''La Naci\u00f3n'' newspaper, 52,000 fans attended the game, an Argentina 2\u20131 win, where the Uruguayan team left the field with only four minutes to play. Argentine players later complained about the rough play of the Uruguayans during the match, while their rivals also complained about the aggressiveness of local spectators, who threw bottles at them at the end of the match.<ref>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1181561-el-gol-olimpico-cumple-85-anos \"El gol ol\u00edmpico cumple 85 a\u00f1os\"], Canchallena.com, 2 October 2009</ref>\n\nIn 1925, the South American championship was hosted by third time in Argentina, and the ''Albicelest'' won its second title. The team played four matches and remained unbeaten once more, defeating Paraguay and Brazil twice each. A highmark was the 4\u20131 victory against rivals Brazil.\n\nArgentina won another consecutive title in 1927 obtaining the [[1927 South American Championship|South American championship held in Peru]]. The team made a great campaign, finishing unbeaten with three wins over three games played. The national squad achieved a large victory over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] (7\u20131), then beating Uruguay by 3\u20132 and the local team by 5\u20131 in the last match of the tournament. It was the third South American title for the Argentina national team.\n\n===1928 Summer Olympics===\n{{Main|Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|Argentina Olympic football team}}\n[[File:Argentina football team Olympics 1928.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The team that reached the final of the 1928 Summer Olympics.]]\n\nIn 1928, Argentina went to Amsterdam to play the [[1928 Summer Olympics]], which was the first international tournament played by the national team in its history. The football squad reached the final after trashing the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] 11\u20132, Belgium 6\u20133 and Egypt 6\u20130.

Argentina finished unbeaten once more, defeating all its rivals in the group: [[Peru national football team|Peru]] (3\u20130), Paraguay (4\u20131) and Uruguay in the last match played in the [[Estadio Gas\u00f3metro]] of Buenos Aires. Most of players that took part of the team would play for Argentina in the first World Cup organized by FIFA one year later.\n\nArgentina was one of the 13 national teams attending to the inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]] hosted by Uruguay.\n\nIn the inaugural match of the World Cup, Argentina defeated [[France national football team|France]] 1\u20130. The national team then beat [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 6\u20133 and finished its run in the first stage by defeating [[Chile national football team|Chile]] 3\u20131. Argentina qualified to the semi-finals where the squad widely beat the United States 6\u20131. On July 30, Argentina played its first World Cup final against Uruguay, but lost 4\u20132.\n\n===1934\u201354: A long absence===\nArgentina played only one game at the next [[1934 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in Italy in 1934. The tournament format was a knockout tournament, and Argentina lost its only match 3\u20132 to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. Argentina would not participate in the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] in France, the last before [[World War II]]. The first World Cup after the War was the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] held in Brazil, but Argentina did not enter the competition due to a conflict with the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]]. For the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]] in Switzerland, Argentina refused to participate.\n\nIn 1951, Argentina played [[England national football team|England]] for the first time and were defeated 2\u20131 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. The second leg was played in Buenos Aires on 14 June 1953, where Argentina won 3\u20131, though the match caused great repercussions in Argentina.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/05/14/d-05301.htm \"Los 50 a\u00f1os del gol de Grillo a Inglaterra\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 14 May 2003</ref>\n\n===From ''Los Carasucias'' to the 1958 disaster===\n[[File:Carasucias.JPG|thumb|right|200px|''Los Carasucias'': Corbatta, Maschio, Angelillo, S\u00edvori and Cruz.]]\n\nAlthough Argentina did not contest any World Cups from 1934 to 1954, the team won the [[1937 South American Championship|1937]], [[1941 South American Championship|1941]], [[1945 South American Championship|1945]], [[1946 South American Championship|1946]], [[1947 South American Championship|1947]], [[1955 South American Championship|1955]] and [[1957 South American Championship|1957]] South American championships, all squads coached by Guillermo St\u00e1bile.\n\nThe 1957 squad is probably the most remembered team of those years because of its skilled players and exquisite style of playing showed on the field. Argentina was trashed [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] (8\u20132), [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] (3\u20130), Uruguay (4\u20130), Chile (6\u20132) and Brazil (3\u20130). The team was defeated by Peru in the last game but won the tournament due to finishing first in its group. The attacking line, formed by [[Oreste Corbatta]], [[Humberto Maschio]], [[Antonio Valent\u00edn Angelillo|Antonio Angelillo]], [[Omar S\u00edvori]] and [[Osvaldo H\u00e9ctor Cruz|Osvaldo Cruz]], was widely praised by then, being still remembered by the media and football fans.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/04/03/deportes/d-04901.htm \"Los Carasucias: la gloria cumple 50 a\u00f1os\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014055858/http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/04/03/deportes/d-04901.htm |date=2013-10-14 }}, ''Clar\u00edn'', 3 April 2007</ref> Maschio was also the topscorer with 9 goals.\n\nArgentina returned to a World Cup competition after 24 years, more precisely to the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] held in Sweden.

Although the squad was formed with valued players, the lack of experience facing European squads was evidenced once the tournament finished. Argentina lost to [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] 3\u20131 in the first game, though they came back to defeat [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] in the second match. Argentina was finally thrashed by [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] 6\u20131, one of the worst defeats of a national team in a World Cup and being eliminated from the competition. The poor performance was called \"''El desastre de Suecia''\" (\"The Sweden disaster\").

The team thrashed Chile 6\u20131 at the debut, then beat Bolivia 2\u20130, Peru and Paraguay 3\u20131, Uruguay 4\u20131 and finished with a 1\u20131 draw against Brazil. Argentina remained unbeaten, winning five of six matches played. The team was coached by a triumvirate composed by [[Victorio Spinetto]], [[Jos\u00e9 Della Torre]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Barreiro (footballer)|Jos\u00e9 Barreiro]], replacing Guillermo St\u00e1bile after his 19-year tenure in the national team. Argentina would not win a Copa Am\u00e9rica until [[1991 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], when the team coached by [[Alfio Basile]] obtained the trophy in Chile.\n\nIn 1959, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Moreno]] became Argentina coach, although he did not spend much time with the team. Under his coaching Argentina disputed the [[1959 South American Championship (Ecuador)|Southamerican championship in Ecuador]], where the squad defeated Paraguay 4\u20132, drew the hosts 1\u20131 and suffered a large defeat by 5\u20130 at the hands of Uruguay, although the team achieved a great 4\u20131 victory against Brazil with three goals by [[Jos\u00e9 Sanfilippo]] in the last match. Once the extra tournament finished, Moreno left his place and Guillermo St\u00e1bile started his 2nd period as coach of Argentina national team.\n\nIn 1960, Argentina won its first and only [[Panamerican Championship 1960|Panamerican championship]] held in [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica]]. That same year the team suffered three losses to Brazil: two of them in the Roca Cup and the next in the Atlantic Cup. That was the last match where Argentina was coached by St\u00e1bile in his second tenure. He would be replaced by [[Victorio Spinetto]].\n\nIn 1961, Argentina started a tour across Europe, playing several matches against local national teams. The squad only achieved one victory against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] with two losses and two draws. After a short period coached by Jos\u00e9 D'Amico, [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] took over the team.

Minella left the team, being replaced by [[Osvaldo Zubeld\u00eda]] after qualification was over. [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] took over the squad, beginning his second tenure on the national side.\n\nThe national side played several friendly matches against [[Soviet Union national football team|the Soviet Union]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] before its flight to England.

Argentina qualified to the quarter-finals where the team was defeated by the host team 1\u20130. It was a controversial match where midfielder [[Antonio Ratt\u00edn]] was sent off by German referee Rudolf Kreitlein for \"violence of the tongue\", despite the referee speaking no Spanish. Ratt\u00edn was so incensed with the decision, believing the referee to be biased in favour of England, that he refused to leave.

The national squad shared its group with Bolivia and Peru, losing the first two games played as the away team. Although Argentina won the next game (over Bolivia, 1\u20130), the 2\u20132 draw against Peru in the last fixture (played at [[La Bombonera Stadium|La Bombonera]]) allowed the Peruvian squad to be one of the South American representatives in the World Cup, eliminating Argentina.<ref name=transition/><ref>[http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/stories/classicqualifiers/news/newsid=735385.html \"El d\u00eda que Per\u00fa enmudeci\u00f3 a La Bombonera\", FIFA official site]</ref> To date, this remains the only time that Argentina has failed to qualify for a World Cup in which it entered a team.

Pizzuti was the manager during three years, in which Argentina played several friendly games against South American teams, which included the 1971 Roca Cup title (shared with Brazil). In 1972, Argentina was invited to play the Brazil Independence Cup, where the team did not achieve good results.\n\nAfter the Independence Cup, Pizzuti was replaced by [[Omar S\u00edvori]], the most notable player of the 1957 Copa Am\u00e9rica triumph and had previous experience as manager of [[Rosario Central]] and [[Estudiantes de La Plata]]. Argentina played some friendly matches as preparation for the qualifying, with some interesting results such as a 3\u20132 over West Germany in [[Munich]].\n\n===\"The Ghost Team\" and 1974 World Cup===\nQualifying for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] began in September 1973, where Argentina shared its group with Bolivia and Paraguay. Bolivia used to play its home venues at [[La Paz]], where Argentine players suffered the lack of oxygen and other effects caused by [[altitude sickness]]. To avoid complications, S\u00edvori decide to prepare a team to play in altitude. Following his instructions, Miguel Ignomiriello took many players to [[Tilcara]] so they could become acclimatized to altitude.<ref>[http://decelesteyblanco.blogspot.com.ar/2008/03/la-seleccin-fantasma.html \"Historias Albicelestes: La Selecci\u00f3n Fantasma\" by Eduardo C\u00e1ntaro]</ref><ref>[http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/nota.php?id=209363 \"Ese equipo fantasma\", ''Diario Uno''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015173356/http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/nota.php?id=209363 |date=2013-10-15 }}, 3 April 2009</ref>\n\nArgentina won the match played in La Paz 1\u20130.

With its new coach on the bench, Argentina played only four matches before the competition, facing European teams. Argentina defeated Romania and France and drew England before suffering a defeat to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] by 4\u20131.\n\nOnce more, Argentina made a poor performance in a World Cup. They were defeated by Poland in their opening game by 3\u20132, followed by a 1\u20131 draw with Italy. In the last game of the first round, Argentina defeated [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]] 4\u20131, granting qualification to the second round of the tournament, where the team lost to the Netherlands, Brazil, ending with a 1\u20131 draw to [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]]. Argentina finished last in the group table and eighth in the overall table.\n\n===The Menotti era: Beginning of greatness===\nThe demise of the team in the World Cup forced the Association to make changes in Argentine football. David Bracuto was named president of the Football Association in 1974. He offered [[C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti]] the head coaching role of Argentina, which Menotti accepted under several conditions, one being that native players under 25 should not be sold to foreign clubs.<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7862%3Aseleccion-prioridad-numero-1&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"Selecci\u00f3n, prioridad n\u00famero uno\", AFA website]</ref>\n\nMenotti debuted on 12 October 1974 in a friendly match against [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. Argentina began a long preparation for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] which would be hosted on home soil for the very first time, playing friendly matches and tournaments. During those years, Argentina played a total of 33 matches. The year 1977 was also the international debut of [[Diego Maradona]], who played for the first time at age 16 against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. The match was held in Buenos Aires with a large victory for Argentina by 5\u20131.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/02/27/um/m-01371213.htm \"A 30 a\u00f1os del debut de Maradona en la Selecci\u00f3n\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 27 February 2007</ref>\n\nArgentina also played a new edition of Copa Am\u00e9rica, where for the first time there was no fixed venue. All matches were played throughout each country across the tournament. Argentina debuted thrashing Venezuela but lost to Brazil in the two games played (2\u20131 and 1\u20130).

Although Maradona was considered one of the best players in the world, Menotti did not include him in the definitive list for the tournament. Some sources state that the [[National Reorganization Process|Argentine military junta]] that ruled Argentina by then pushed Menotti to include River Plate's midfielder [[Norberto Alonso]] instead of Maradona, and that Menotti almost certainly knew that the prodigiously talented 17-year old would not be able to handle the immense pressure and attention in the biggest sporting event in Argentina's history. Nevertheless, other journalists assert that there were too many offensive midfielders.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eblog.com.ar/4318/maradona-y-el-mundial-%C2%B478/ |title=\"Maradona y el Mundial 78\" |access-date=2012-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022131351/http://www.eblog.com.ar/4318/maradona-y-el-mundial-%c2%b478/ |archive-date=2013-10-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Passarella world cup.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Team captain [[Daniel Passarella]] holding the World Cup trophy.]]\nArgentina finally debuted on 2 June 1978 against Hungary, winning 2\u20131.

In the second round Argentina was placed in Group 1 sharing it with Brazil, Poland and Peru. In the first game, Argentina beat Poland 2\u20130, with both goals from Mario Kempes. Next game was against South American powerhouse Brazil in which the game ended with a 0\u20130 draw. The last game was against Peru, a rival that Argentina easily defeated with a 6\u20130 win. Argentina was able to edge out Brazil in the group and went on to the final. Argentina had to beat Peru by four goals or more to progress.

On 25 June 1978, at River Plate's [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|Estadio Monumental]] in Buenos Aires, Argentina played its second World Cup final. Mario Kempes gave Argentina the lead in the 38th minute, with the Dutch squad able to respond in the 82nd minute for the equalizer. The game went to extra time and Mario Kempes once again gave the Argentines the lead and [[Daniel Bertoni]] added another goal which sealed the win for Argentina, which became the second South American team to win the World Cup at its home soil. Kempes was not only the most notable player of the team but also the topscorer of the tournament with six goals.\n\nAfter the success of the World Cup, Menotti continued as coach and Argentina played some friendly match as preparation for the [[1979 Copa Am\u00e9rica]]. Maradona scored his first goal for the Senior team against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in [[Glasgow]], where Argentina won 3\u20131.<ref>[http://blogsdeteaydeportea.com/contenidos/940-a-30-anos-del-primer-gol-de-maradona.html \"A 30 a\u00f1os del primer gol de Maradona\", DeporTEA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726023934/http://www.blogsdeteaydeportea.com/contenidos/940-a-30-anos-del-primer-gol-de-maradona.html |date=2011-07-26 }}, 2 June 2009</ref>\n\nThe highlight of 1979 was the [[1979 FIFA World Youth Championship]] obtained by the [[Argentina under-20 national football team|under-20 team]] in [[Tokyo]]. The team, also coached by Menotti, won the tournament with Maradona and [[Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz]] as the leaders and most notable players of the squad. The tournament was also the first official championship played by Maradona in a national team.\n\nDue to Argentina needing no qualifiers to the next World Cup as holders, the national team played a series of matches as preparation for the competition. In 1980 there was no official tournaments so the team toured on Europe and also hosted friendly games in some of the most important cities of Argentina such as [[Mar del Plata]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]. Argentina played the [[1980 Mundialito]], a competition hosted by Uruguay in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the first World Cup tournament, where the team defeated West Germany and drew with Brazil to be eliminated in the first stage.\n\n===1982: End of an era and beginning of Maradona era===\n[[File:Arg1982 v Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Argentina players leaving the field after being eliminated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]].]]\n\nIn 1982 the Argentine squad travelled to Spain to participate in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] while Argentina was fighting in the [[Falklands War]] (''Guerra de Malvinas'') with the United Kingdom after the invasion of the [[Falkland Islands]] had been ordered by president [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] on April 2.\n\nThe lineup was based on the 1978 team with the addition of Diego Maradona (who had won a domestic title playing at a high level) and Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz. The squad arrived in Spain as a big favourite to win the Cup.  Argentina debuted with a 1\u20130 loss to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] at [[Camp Nou]] in [[Barcelona]]. There were internal tensions within the camp between the older and younger players, and this caused problems. Nevertheless, the team recovered by defeating Hungary (4\u20131) and  [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] (2\u20130) therefore qualifying for the next stage. In the second round, Argentina shared a group with Italy and Brazil, being defeated by both (3\u20131 and 2\u20131) and eliminated from the championship. Maradona could not show his skills during the tournament, suffering from the rough play of rivals (especially [[Claudio Gentile]] in the game against Italy). He would eventually be sent off by the referee after kicking Brazilian player [[Jo\u00e3o Batista da Silva|Batista]] in the groin.<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7863%3Auna-alegria-y-un-golpe-inesperado&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"Una alegr\u00eda y un golpe inesperado (1979/1982)\", AFA official website]</ref><ref>[http://www.marca.com/reportajes/2010/04/espana_1982/2010/04/19/seccion_01/1271693378.html \"Maradona fue mundialista por primera vez en Espa\u00f1a\" by Javier Estepa], ''Marca''</ref>\n\nOther players that formed the squad were [[Juan Barbas]], [[Gabriel Calder\u00f3n]] (from the 1979 youth championship-winning team), [[Patricio Hern\u00e1ndez]], [[Julio Olarticoechea]], [[Enzo Trossero]] and [[Jorge Valdano]].\n\nThe failure at the World Cup caused Menotti to leave his post. Despite the poor performances, the national team achieved two world titles (senior and youth) during the nine years with Menotti as coach.

Bilardo was famous for his perfectionism and obsession with tactic and strategy of the game, which called the attention as much as followers as critics. The Bilardo era began in May 1983 with a 2\u20132 draw with Chile in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. Soon after Argentina played the [[1983 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], the first official tournament with Bilardo. The squad was eliminated on first round with 3 draws (2 with [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] and a 0\u20130 with Brazil), winning its only match 1\u20130 to Brazil in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe team was formed by footballers playing in domestic [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] exclusively, being some of them goalkeepers [[Ubaldo Fillol]] and [[Nery Pumpido]], defenders [[N\u00e9stor Clausen]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]], [[Enzo Trossero]], [[Julio Olarticoechea]] and [[Roberto Mouzo]]; midfielders [[Claudio Marangoni]], [[Jorge Burruchaga]], [[Alejandro Sabella]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ponce]]; forwards [[Ricardo Gareca]], [[Alberto M\u00e1rcico]].\n\nAfter the Copa Am\u00e9rica, Argentina travelled to [[Calcuta]] to play the Nehru Cup, then playing a series of friendly matches before the qualifiers to [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in Mexico. The team made a successful tour on Europe where it won the three matches disputed, including a 3\u20131 against West Germany in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. In May 1985, Argentina played its first qualifying match against [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]], winning 3\u20132. Argentina won three consecutive games, to Colombia (3\u20131 home, 1\u20130 away) and Venezuela (3\u20130 home) but lost to Peru 1\u20130 in [[Lima]] in a match where Peru midfielder [[Claudio Reyna]] marked Maradona with excessive roughness, although he was not sent off by the referee.<ref>[http://tn.com.ar/deportes/hazanas/a-27-anos-de-la-marca-personal-a-maradona-reyna-sigue-siendo-idolo-en-peru_270462 \"A 27 a\u00f1os de la marca personal a Maradona\"], [[Todo Noticias|TN]], 10 September 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.terra.com/espdep/articulo/html/fox239751.htm \"Maradona no olvida a Luis Reyna\"], ''[[Terra Networks|Terra]]'', 4 May 2006</ref>\n\nArgentina played the last match of the qualifiers against Peru in Buenos Aires.

''[[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|Clar\u00edn]]'', the most popular newspaper of Argentina, was one of the hardest opponents of the coach, and Bilardo himself declared that Clar\u00edn called Association President [[Julio Grondona]] to ask him to fire the coach.<ref name=eltiempo>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1508493-bilardo-el-tiempo-me-dio-la-razon \"Bilardo: El tiempo me dio la raz\u00f3n\" - CanchaLlena.com], 19 September 2012</ref>\n\nBefore the World Cup, Argentina toured Europe losing to [[France national football team|France]] (one of the favorites to win the Cup) and [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and largely defeating [[Israel national football team|Israel]] by 7\u20132.<ref>[http://muyfutbol.com/35227/equipos-historicos-argentina-campeon-del-mundo-1986-la-angustia-que-precedio-a-la-gloria/ \"Argentina campe\u00f3n del Mundo 1986, la angustia que precedi\u00f3 a la gloria\", Muy Futbol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025231603/http://muyfutbol.com/35227/equipos-historicos-argentina-campeon-del-mundo-1986-la-angustia-que-precedio-a-la-gloria/ |date=2012-10-25 }}, 27 June 2012</ref>\n\n===1986: Return to glory===\n[[File:Argentina x corea 1986.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The team that debuted v.

Argentina was placed in Group A alongside Italy, [[Bulgarian national football team|Bulgaria]], and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. In the first game, Argentina was able to beat South Korea 3\u20131. The second match was against Italy, a tougher opponent. Italy took the lead in the sixth minute but Diego Maradona responded with a goal in the 34th minute. The game later ended with a 1\u20131 draw.

The game started very evenly, with both teams getting chances to score but none were able to finish. The first half ended with Argentina having the majority of possession but unable to get past a tough defense. Six minutes following the second half, Maradona scored a [[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup)#The \"Hand of God\"|controversial goal]] in which he used his hand; once the match finished, Maradona called it \"''la mano de Dios''\" (\"the hand of God\"), explicitly admitting the infringement. The goal began with a defensive error from [[Steve Hodge]], who passed the ball incorrectly back to his goalkeeper, [[Peter Shilton]]. At that time, Maradona was still continuing his run and reached the ball first and netted it in with his left fist. After the goal, Maradona encouraged his teammates to embrace the goal so the referee would allow it. Four minutes after the \"hand of God\" goal, Maradona scored a goal which people{{Who|date=March 2015}} called \"The Goal of the Century\" because of the individual effort of Maradona, who starting his run from the half-way line, passed four English midfielders (he beat midfielder [[Terry Butcher]] twice) and dribbled around Shilton, finally scoring the goal which allowed Argentina to win the match, 2\u20131. That victory was very celebrated due to not only the rivalry between both teams but Argentina had lost the Falklands War at the hands of the [[British Army]] four years prior.<ref>[http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=392/index.html \"La magia de Maradona tumba a Inglaterra\" - FIFA.es]</ref>\n\n[[File:Maradona cup azteca.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Diego Maradona raising the FIFA World Cup trophy at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City.]]\nIn the semi-finals, Argentina defeated Belgium 2\u20130 at the Estadio Azteca to advance to the [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] against West Germany. Argentina won a game played at the Azteca in which the squad won its second World Cup title. [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]] opened the scoring for Argentina, then the team increased the lead with a goal by [[Jorge Valdano]]. Germany started a comeback with goals from [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]] and [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]], which evened the game at 2\u20132. [[Jorge Burruchaga]] scored the winning goal in the 83rd minute, giving Argentina a 3\u20132 victory over Germany.\n\nArgentina remained unbeaten in the World Cup, winning five over six matches disputed.

The line-up in the final was: [[Nery Pumpido]], Brown, [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuciuffo]], Ruggeri, [[Julio Olarticoechea]]; [[Ricardo Giusti]], [[Sergio Batista]], Enrique, Burruchaga; Maradona, Valdano.\n\n===1987\u20131990===\nAfter winning the World Cup, the players went on vacation and Argentina did not play a match until 1987, when a new edition of Copa Am\u00e9rica was contested. The tournament changed its format, returning to a unique host where Argentina was chosen. Argentine formed a team with a mix of players from European and local leagues. The squad debuted with a 1\u20131 draw against Per\u00fa, then beat Ecuador 3\u20130. In the second stage, Argentina lost to Uruguay (which would be the champion) 1\u20130 in Buenos Aires and was eliminated. At the end of 1987, Argentina played West Germany (the rival of the 1986 final) winning 1\u20130 at the [[Estadio Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani]]. In 1988, the squad played the Four Nations Cup, losing to the Soviet Union (4\u20132) and West Germany (1\u20130).\n\nArgentina immediately went to Australia to contest the Australia Bicentennial Gold Cup, where the team did not have a good performance, with one win against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] and a large defeat by [[Australia national soccer team|the local team]] (4\u20131).\n\nBack to Argentina, the team started its preparation for the [[1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], held in Brazil. Argentina qualified to the second round after beating Chile and Uruguay (both 1\u20130) and two draws with Ecuador and Bolivia (both 0\u20130). In the second stage, Argentina lost to Brazil and Uruguay (both 2\u20130) and only drew with Paraguay (0\u20130). Argentina was eliminated without winning a game and with no goals scored on this round. Some players of the team were Pumpido, Brown, Ruggeri, Clausen, Cuciuffo, Burruchaga, Maradona, Enrique, Giusti (all of them world champions in 1986), [[Claudio Caniggia]], [[Abel Balbo]], [[Luis Islas]], [[Roberto Sensini]], [[Gabriel Calder\u00f3n]], [[N\u00e9stor Gorosito]] and [[Pedro Troglio]].\n\n===1990: Finalist again===\nArgentina went to the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] with no qualifiers needed as being the previous champion. Prior to the World Cup, the national team played some several matches with no good results: Argentina lost to Mexico (0\u20132) and Scotland (0\u20132), winning just one of the five games played (to Israel, chosen again to be the last rival before the tournament as it had been four years before). In addition, Jorge Valdano (one of the most important players during the 1986 World Cup) trained hard in order to be in good physical condition for the Cup, but Bilardo decided not to include him in the definitive list of players. To that, Valdano said, \"I swam through the ocean but I drowned at the shore.\" In addition to Valdano not playing, a number of other important players were injured, so Argentina resorted to cynical tactics on the field, as they knew they could not win easily in a straight fight.<ref>[http://www.elespectador.com/deportes/futbolinternacional/articulo-378474-dos-anos-seleccion-colombia-tendra-un-gran-equipo Interview to Valdano] at Colombian newspaper ''[[El Espectador]]'', 30 September 2012</ref>\n\nArgentina finally debuted at the inaugural match at the [[San Siro]] in [[Milan]], being defeated by [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] (1\u20130). This result caused a great surprise in Argentina<ref>[http://www.generaccion.com/usuarios/20284/sorpresa-mundial-italia-1990-camerun-vence-argentina-1-0 \"Sorpresa en Mundial Italia 1990: Camer\u00fan vence a Argentina\"  - Generacion.com], 8 June 2010</ref> so the national team line-up was based on the 1986 world champion.\n\n[[File:Caniggia scoring v Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Claudio Caniggia]] scoring the only goal against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in [[Turin]].]]\nArgentina won its second match against the Soviet Union 2\u20130 (where titular goalkeeper was [[Nery Pumpido]] seriously injured, being replaced by [[Sergio Goycochea]] for the rest of the tournament), and drew 1\u20131 with [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the last match of first round, both played in [[Naples]], where Maradona played for [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] in the [[Serie A]]. The team qualified to the second round, where they faced Brazil at the [[Stadio delle Alpi]] in [[Turin]]. In a match where Brazil played much better than Argentina, with forwards [[M\u00fcller (footballer)|M\u00fcller]] and [[Careca]] repeatedly shooting to the goal but missing the target (the ball clashed Argentina's posts a couple of times, while Goycoechea stopped other shots) Argentina (with Maradona in bad physical condition) resisted Brazilian offensive movements during the first half, which ended 0\u20130. In the second half, Brazil was not so persistent as it had been during the first 45 minutes, so Argentina took advantage of the situation. With nine minutes till full-time, Maradona took the ball in the centre of the field, dribbled past three opponents and made a precise pass to winger [[Claudio Caniggia]], who advanced with the ball to a goal after dribbling around goalkeeper [[Cl\u00e1udio Taffarel]]. Argentina won the match 1\u20130, eliminating its arch-rival in a World Cup for the first time. That match is still regarded by the media and fans as one of the most remarkable moments of an Argentina national team.<ref>[http://www.mundialsudafrica.com/partidos-memorables-argentina-1-brasil-0-italia-1990/ \"Partidos memorables: Argentina 1-Brasil 0\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.goal.com/es-ar/slideshow/375/1/cinco-victorias-memorables-sobre-brasil \"Cinco victorias memorables sobre Brasil\" by Jonatan Fabbian at Goal.com]</ref>\n\nFor their quarter-final match in [[Florence]], Argentina narrowly eliminated [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in an exciting [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]],<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/01/sports/world-cup-90-argentina-beats-yugoslavia.html \"Argentina beats Yugoslavia\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 July 1990</ref> with Goycoechea becoming a hero after stopping three penalty kicks, including the last two.<ref name=goyco>[http://playfutbol.infobae.com/notas/676284-Nacia-Sergio-Goycochea-el-gran-heroe-de-los-penales-en-Italia-1990.html \"Nac\u00eda Sergio Goycochea, el gran h\u00e9roe de los penales en Italia 1990\", Play Futbol], 17 October 2012</ref> Maradona also missed a penalty kick, a rare occurrence; at one point Argentina were behind the Yugoslavs, but Goycoechea's outstanding goalkeeping kept Argentina in the tournament.\n\n[[File:Argentina vs italy worldcup.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The squad that beat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Napoli]], qualifying for the final.]]\nArgentina advanced to semi-finals where it to play against Italy in Naples. The local host was considered favourite to win the match because their striker [[Salvatore Schillaci]] was the tournament's top scorer (he would be awarded both the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball at the end of the tournament) and  Argentina had many injured players, Maradona being one of them. Nevertheless, Argentina made its best performance in the World Cup and the match ended 1\u20131 after 90 minutes. With zero goals in extra time, the game went to a penalty shootout where Goycoechea was the hero again, stopping the shots from [[Aldo Serena]] and [[Roberto Donadoni]] to send Argentina to its second-straight World Cup final.\n\nFor the final in Rome, Argentina played West Germany, coached by former player [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. Caniggia was suspended for one game after receiving a yellow card in the match against Italy so he could not play the final. Germany arrived to the final as a wide favorite to take the Cup, as the squad had showed an effective and precise playing style, unlike Argentina which (with the exception of the game with Italy) had not had good previous performances. In addition, German footballers were in good condition while the Argentine players came to the final with several injuries, including Maradona. The game proved to be violent, brutal and bad tempered, particularly from the Argentines. Nevertheless, Germany only could score a goal at 83 minutes for a doubtful punishment by Mexican referee [[Edgardo Codesal]], who awarded Germany a penalty kick for what he thought was a foul by Roberto Sensini against Rudi V\u00f6ller. The call was controversial, and it was heavily debated by the Argentinian players. Andreas Brehme converted the penalty kick to give West Germany team its third World Cup title.<ref>[http://www.infobae.com/notas/nota.php?Idx=260625&IdxSeccion=0 \"La pol\u00e9mica alemana sobre el penal en la final de Italia 90\"], ''Infobae'', 16 June 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.geofutbol.com/2008/10/26/final-italia-1990-alemania-1-0-argentina/ \"Final Italia 1990: Alemania 1-0 Argentina\" -GeoFutbol.com]</ref>\n\nThe 1986 champion side could not repeat the high performances made four years prior, most notably Maradona, who played all the tournament injured.

The national team played some friendly matches and tournaments such as the Stanley Rous Cup, where Argentina drew 2\u20132 with England at Wembley Stadium (after losing 0\u20132 after the first half).

Argentina won the tournament unbeaten, winning six of seven matches. [[Gabriel Batistuta]] was also the leading scorer of the Copa with six goals. Apart from Batistuta, Sergio Goycochea, [[Leonardo Astrada]], Claudio Caniggia, [[Diego Simeone]] (who wore the number 10 kit shirt), [[Dario Franco]], [[Leonardo Rodr\u00edguez|Leo Rodr\u00edguez]] were some of the most notable Argentine players.<ref name=recambio/>\n\nIn 1992, Argentina won the friendly tournament [[Kirin Cup]] (defeating [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and [[Wales national football team|Wales]]).

The team shared group with Colombia, Paraguay and Peru. Argentina won the first two as visitor to Peru (1\u20130 in Lima) and Paraguay (3\u20131 in [[Asunci\u00f3n]]) but lost to Colombia 2\u20131 in [[Barranquilla]]. In Buenos Aires, Argentina defeated Peru 2\u20131, drew with Paraguay 0\u20130 and suffered a catastrophic loss to Colombia 5\u20130 on 5 September 1993 in the Estadio Monumental. It became the largest defeat to a national team since a 1\u20136 result in the 1958 World Cup.

The team lost to Brazil 0\u20132 but beat [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] 3\u20131 at [[Salta]] and smashed Israel 3\u20130 in [[Ramat Gan]]. Argentina debuted in the championship thrashing [[Greece national football team|Greece]] 4\u20130 in [[Boston]], with a hat-trick by Batistuta. Maradona also scored the third goal for Argentina, which would be his last goal in a World Cup. The national team played its second match against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] again in Boston, which defeated by 2\u20131 (2 goals by Caniggia). At the end of the match, Argentina became a favorite to win the tournament, due to the attacking playing style showed by the squad (playing with four forwards), the number of goals scored and the good performances of some of its players such as Redondo, Caniggia, Batistuta, and even the aging Maradona, who looked in great shape and scored a gem of a goal.\n\nAt the end of the match against Nigeria, Maradona was called for the drug test, which gave positive results for [[ephedrine]], a banned substance. The impact and repercussion of the news were immediate, and Maradona was expelled from the tournament and suspended for 15 months by [[FIFA]].<ref>[http://soccerlens.com/doping-in-football/19458/ \"Doping in football\" by Victor Li on SoccerLens.com], 6 January 2009</ref>\n\nWith the team still hurt after losing its leader, Argentina was defeated by Bulgaria in the sweltering heat of [[Dallas]] for their last match of the first round. The team qualified to the knockout phase, where they were beaten by Romania 3\u20132 in [[Los Angeles]]; Basile decided not to include Caniggia in this match after he was benched during the 27th minute of the Bulgaria match. After the successes of 1986 and 1990, Argentina was eliminated in the second round. Although eliminated in the second round; in an [[ESPN]] interview with [[Quique Wolff]], Maradona called the 1994 squad the greatest Argentina team of all time.\n\n===1998 World Cup===\nWith Maradona officially retired, Argentina went into the tournament with high expectations, still fielding players from their previous tournament, with Gabriel Batistuta still a constant goalscoring threat and Diego Simeone remaining as the leading figure from the anchorman position. Drawn into Group H of the competition, their opponents consisted of [[Japan national football team|Japan]], [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] and [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. They began their campaign with a 1\u20130 victory over the Asian nation, following it up with a 5\u20130 demolition of the Caribbeans.  Their third group game was against the Croatians, who had also confirmed qualification to the next round and ended with victory for the ''Albiceleste'' by 1\u20130.\n\nArgentina went into the knockout phase with the impressive record of seven goals scored, keeping clean sheets in all three group games.  Their opponent was England]], fielding an equally strong team. Argentina took the lead with just six minutes played through Gabriel Batistuta from the penalty spot, only for [[Alan Shearer]] to equalize through the same means four minutes later. Six minutes after, youngster [[Michael Owen]] broke past [[Roberto Ayala]] to score a great individual effort, which was eventually cancelled out one minute into stoppage time after a free kick routine put [[Javier Zanetti]] through on goal to score, leaving the final result at 2\u20132 at the end of the first half.\n\nIn the second half, England playmaker [[David Beckham]] was sent off after a kick on Simeone, with the scores remaining unchanged until the end of normal time and extra time.  Argentina won 4\u20133 on penalties, after Ayala scored the decisive spot kick to book their quarter-final spot, where the Netherlands awaited them.\n\nThe game was an equally fought match, with both sides scoring early goals; [[Patrick Kluivert]] netting after just 12 minutes and [[Claudio L\u00f3pez (footballer)|Claudio L\u00f3pez]] equalizing five minutes later.  Argentina held an advantage as the Dutch went a man down with the dismissal of [[Arthur Numan]] after his second booking for a foul on Simeone, though they were unable to take the opportunity and break the deadlock before they too went a man down; with [[Ariel Ortega]] receiving two successive yellow cards, the first one for diving inside the penalty box, with the second coming after headbutting Dutch goalkeeper [[Edwin van der Sar]]. Argentina's defence held tightly as extra-time beckoned, until a long aerial ball from Dutch captain [[Frank de Boer]] found [[Dennis Bergkamp]], who maneuvered around Ayala and beat the Argentine goalkeeper Roa to send the Dutch through, eliminating Argentina from the competition.\n\n===2006 World Cup===\nArgentina had been eliminated at the group stage at Korea/Japan [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], although they had been among the pre-tournament favorites. There was a high expectation of a better performance in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] in Germany. Argentina qualified for the knockout stages with wins over the Ivory Coast (2\u20131) and [[Serbia national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]] (6\u20130), and a 0\u20130 draw with the Netherlands.\n\nIn the round of 16, Argentina defeated Mexico 2\u20131 in extra-time, the winning goal scored by [[Maxi Rodr\u00edguez]]; this goal went on to win an online poll organized by FIFA as the best goal of the World Cup.<ref>http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/bgt.html</ref>  In the quarter-final, they lost 4\u20132 in penalties against hosts Germany after a 1\u20131 draw. A brawl erupted between the Argentines and Germans after the game ended; unused substitute [[Leandro Cufr\u00e9]] was sent off for kicking [[Per Mertesacker]], while Maxi Rodr\u00edguez hit [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] from behind. Following an investigation of video evidence, FIFA issued four-and two-game suspensions for Cufre and Rodr\u00edguez respectively. Germany's [[Torsten Frings]] was also suspended for the semi-final match for punching [[Julio Ricardo Cruz|Julio Cruz]].\n\nShortly after the elimination, coach [[Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman]] resigned from his position. The AFA appointed Alfio Basile, who had previously managed the national side during the 1994 World Cup, as his successor.\n\n===2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nArgentina won all three games in the group stage, beating the United States, Colombia and Paraguay. After convincing victories over Peru and Mexico in the quarter-final and semi-final, respectively, they were favorites to beat Brazil in the final, but were defeated 3\u20130.\n\n===2010 World Cup===\n[[File:Messi Podolski Di Maria 2010.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Lionel Messi]] carries out the ball, followed by [[Lukas Podolski]] in the quarter-finals of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].]]\n\nPrior to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], [[Diego Maradona]] was appointed head coach. During the qualification process, he oversaw a 6\u20131 defeat to [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] in [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]], and after a string of losses and draws, Argentina came dangerously close to failing to qualify, but victories in the last two matches secured qualification for the final tournament. In the final tournament itself, Argentina was placed in Group B, winning all their games. Their first game was against Nigeria, where Argentina netted a goal in the sixth minute to ensure a 1\u20130 victory. In the second match, against [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]], a [[Gonzalo Higua\u00edn]] hat-trick and a Korean own goal finished the score at 4\u20131. Argentina's last group game was against Greece, a 2\u20130 victory.\n\nArgentina then advanced to the round of 16 to play Mexico. The game started with controversy when [[Carlos Tevez]] headed a ball from [[Lionel Messi]] for a goal; replay clearly showed that Tevez was in an offside position. Eventually, Argentina beat Mexico 3\u20131 to advance to the quarter-finals. In a much-hyped game, Argentina was shocked after Germany eliminated them with a 4\u20130 win. [[Thomas M\u00fcller]] opened the scoring in the third minute, with [[Miroslav Klose]] adding an additional two and [[Arne Friedrich]] one.\n\n===2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\n[[File:Argentine - Portugal - Argentine.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Argentina line-up at a friendly match against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[Geneva]], February 2011.]]\n\nThe [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] was the first major tournament for new coach [[Sergio Batista]]. Argentina started the tournament with a shocking 1\u20131 tie against underdogs Bolivia. In their second game, they played a goalless draw against Colombia in [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], but went on to win their third game 3\u20130 against underdogs [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. Argentina was to play Uruguay in the quarter-finals. After going down after five minutes to a [[Diego P\u00e9rez (footballer)|Diego P\u00e9rez]] goal, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn equalized in the 17th minute. The score remained unchanged and after extra time, Argentina lost 5\u20134 in penalties with a miss from Carlos Tevez. After the elimination, Batista was sacked and replaced by former [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] coach [[Alejandro Sabella]].\n\n===2014 World Cup===\nArgentina qualified for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] and were drawn into Group F alongside Nigeria, [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and debutants [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Argentina had beaten all three of those teams, easily making it through to the next round. In the next round, they beat [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 1\u20130 after a goalless 90 minutes. In the quarter-finals, they beat Belgium, also 1\u20130 through an early goal. They then beat the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] 4\u20132 from a penalty shootout in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], but lost to eventual winners Germany in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] at the [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], concluding the World Cup runners-up.\n\n===2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nArgentina entered the subsequent tournament, the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] as heavy favorites to take home the trophy. They began their group stage against Paraguay, where after leading 2\u20130 for most of the match ultimately settled for a 2\u20132 draw. Despite doubts in defence, they overcame the difficulties to beat fellow tournament favorites Uruguay and Jamaica. Their quarter-final opponent was Colombia, whose sturdy defense was impossible to break through and goalkeeper [[David Ospina]] making impressive saves to keep the game tied at 0\u20130. In penalties, Argentina missed several chances until Carlos Tevez, who was the sole player to miss his spot kick during the previous tournament, netted his attempt to send ''la Albiceleste'' through to the semi-finals to face Paraguay.  The game was evenly played until half-time, when the score was 2\u20131 to Argentina, but four more goals during the second half allowed Argentina to cruise to the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica Final|final]], where they met host nation Chile.\n\nThe final was a hotly contested match, with both sides having great chances to open the scoring, particularly with a powerful shot from [[Sergio Ag\u00fcero]] in the first half for Argentina, with [[Alexis S\u00e1nchez]] having a clear one for Chile in the second half. With the scores still tied at the end of regulation, the match went to penalties. Only captain Lionel Messi netted his penalty attempt, with Gonzalo Higua\u00edn sending his attempt well over the crossbar and [[\u00c9ver Banega]] having his shot saved by [[Claudio Bravo (footballer)|Claudio Bravo]] to leave the final scoreline at 4\u20131 in penalties.\n\n===Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario===\nOnce more, Argentina entered the tournament as heavy favorites to take home the trophy after 22 years of international drought. ''La Albiceleste'' cruised through their group, with their opening match being a replay of the Copa Am\u00e9rica final from the year before against trophy holders Chile, which Argentina would go on to win 2\u20131. Further victories against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] and Bolivia allowed them to top the group with the maximum number of points. Their quarter-final match was against surprise side Venezuela, where the match remained even for both sides before the Argentines won 4\u20131. They then dispatched hosts United States 4\u20130 to earn yet another [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario Final|final]] clash against Chile.\n\nAs previously, it was an even match, with Chile initially having the upper hand and more possession before going a man down, with [[Marcelo D\u00edaz]] being dismissed after obstructing Messi on the ball. This, however, made it more difficult for Argentina to break through their defence, and they too would go a man down not long after with [[Marcos Rojo]] receiving a straight red card for a tackle on [[Arturo Vidal]]. Once again the match finished 0\u20130 and went to penalties. Although [[Sergio Romero]] saved Vidal's penalty kick, Messi shot his attempt over the crossbar, with the subsequent players netting their attempts until Bravo saved from [[Lucas Biglia]] and [[Francisco Silva]] netted the final penalty to once again hand Chile the trophy. The defeat caused frustration within the Argentine players, with Messi announcing his retirement from international football not long after, as well as many others suggesting their departure from the national team as well.\n\n===2018 World Cup===\nOn 20 May 2017, the [[Argentine Football Association]] announced that [[Jorge Sampaoli]] would take over as the new national team manager, officially on 1 June 2017. Sampaoli's first game in charge was a friendly match against [[Brazil]] on 9 June in Australia, with Argentina winning 1\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2017/04/21/internacional/1492798205_460690.html\n|title= Sampaoli ser\u00e1 presentado con Argentina el 22 de mayo|date= 4 April 2017|work=Diario AS|accessdate= 20 May 2017|language=es}}</ref> However, Argentina struggled during the qualifiers, and it took a [[Lionel Messi]] hat trick at Ecuador to confirm qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/lionel-messi-argentina-win-world-cup-qualify-ecuador-hat-trick-russia-2018-latest-a7993841.html|title=Lionel Messi burnishes legacy with hat-trick as Argentina come from behind to beat Ecuador and book World Cup place|date=11 October 2017|work=The Independent|publisher=ESI Media|author=Miguel Delaney}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 March 2018, in a warm-up preparation friendly match, Argentina, without its captain Messi, who was sidelined for the match due to an injury, was routed 6-1 by 2010 World Cup champion [[Spain national football team|Spain]] at the [[Wanda Metropolitano]] stadium in [[Madrid]]. It was Spain's biggest win over another previous World Cup champion, and Argentina's biggest loss since their 6\u20131 loss to Bolivia in 2009, and also tied the record for Argentina's biggest loss overall, by a margin of five goals.<ref>{{cite news |title=Spain's mauling of Argentina equals record Albiceleste defeat |url=https://en.as.com/en/2018/03/28/football/1522233313_446145.html |newspaper=[[AS (newspaper)|AS]] |date=28 March 2018 |access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 May 2018, Sampaoli announced a 35-man preliminary squad for the 2018 World Cup, and the final squad list was released on 21 May 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/icardi-cut-from-argentinas-23-man-world-cup-squad/lo0f6fig55ih1jh7w9v4enau6 |title=Icardi cut from Argentina's 23-man World Cup squad |publisher=Goal.com |date=21 May 2018 |accessdate=21 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen the World Cup in Russia came around, the tournament was a disaster for the ''Albiceleste''.

existed in Yugoslavia since amendments to the [[1963 Yugoslav Constitution|1963 Constitution]] in 1971.<ref>{{cite news|title=Slu\u017ebeni list Socijalisti\u010dke Federativne Republike

the six republics, the two autonomous provinces within Serbia and (until 1988) the President of the League of Communists. The [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 Constitution]] defined the office of President of the Presidency, but only coming into effect with the disestablishment of the office of President of the Republic.<ref>{{cite news|title=Slu\u017ebeni list Socijalisti\u010dke Federativne Republike Jugoslavije|location=Belgrade|volume=XXX|issue=9|date=21 February 1974}}</ref> A separate article affirmed [[Josip Broz Tito]] with an [[President for life|unlimited mandate]] which ensured the new President of the Presidency would not come into effect until after his death.<ref>{{cite news|title=Slu\u017ebeni list Socijalisti\u010dke Federativne Republike Jugoslavije|location=Belgrade|volume=XXX|issue=9|date=21 February 1974}}</ref> Simultaneously an office of Vice President of the Presidency had been in place since 1971 on a rotating annual basis between republican and provincial representatives. When Tito [[Death and state funeral of Josip Broz Tito|died]] on 4 May 1980, the then Vice President of the Presidency [[Lazar Koli\u0161evski]] acceded to the role of President of the Presidency.

Spei). Later botanists however, overlooked this name. [[Franz Wilibald Schmidt]] named the species ''S. sulcata'' in 1793, [[Henry Cranke Andrews]] in 1800 created the name ''S. imbricata'', while [[Jens Wilken Hornemann]] assigned the name ''S. lateriflora'' to it in 1815. In 1843 [[Carl Daniel Friedrich Meissner|Meissner]] distinguished two varieties, ''S. striata'' var. ''striata'' and ''S. striata''  var. ''angustifolia''. In 1857 he considered ''S. sulcata'', ''S. imbricata'' and ''S. lateriflora'' [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]] of ''S. striata''. [[Charles Henry Wright]] in 1915 in turn regarded ''S. striata'' var. ''angustifolia'' a synonym of ''S. striata''.<ref name=MBMM />\n\n== Description ==\n[[Image:Struthiola_striata_Berkel_1.jpg|thumb|Sideview of the flower]]Roemenaggie is a rounded shrub of up to {{cvt|1.5|m|ft}} high that emerges from a single trunk from the ground. The branches are initially covered in soft hairs pressed firmly to the surface, but become hairless when aging.\nThe leaves are [[Leaf#Arrangement on the stem|in pairs opposing each other]], more or less upright, overlapping each other, with the blade directly attached to the branche without a leaf stalk. They are oval to lance-shaped, {{cvt|5\u20138.5|mm|in}} long and generally {{cvt|2\u20134|mm|in}} wide, somewhat depressed along the main vein, almost pointed, with a row of hairs pressed to the surface along its rim. When the leaves are young 3 to 5 stripes are visible along the length of the outward facing surface.<ref name=MBMM />\n\nThe flowers are seated in the axils of the leaves over a considerable length towards the tip of the branches, an inflorescence type called a [[Raceme#Spike|spike]]. The two [[Bract#Bracteole|bracteoles]] are set opposite each other at the base of the flower, awl-shaped, about {{cvt|2.5|mm|in}} long, with a regular row of hairs along the margin and a blunt tip ending in a tuft of hairs. The [[Sepal|calyx]] is cream-coloured, with at its base a cylindrical tube of about {{cvt|1|cm|in}} long that is covered on the outside with soft hairs pressed against its surface and at its top 4 oval protracted, almost pointy lobes of {{cvt|1\u20132|mm|in}} long and {{cvt|1.5\u20132.5|mm|in}} wide, hairless but for a tuft of hairs at the tips of the outer pair. Four yellow, elliptic, fleshy, petal-like scales are implanted above and alternating with the sepal lobes, and are surrounded by stiff hairs that may be shorter or longer than the scales. About {{cvt|1|mm|in}} below the mouth of the tube sits on whorl of four seated stamens 4, that have a reddish wart at their tips. The [[Ovary (botany)|ovary]] is egg-shaped, hairless and about 1&nbsp;mm long, and is topped by a [[Stigma (botany)#Style|style]] of about {{cvt|8|mm|in}} long and ends in a brush-like [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]].<ref name=MBMM />\n\n=== Differences with related species ===\n''Struthiola'' has its flowers arranged in long spikes, whereas ''[[Gnidia]]'' differs from it in having its flowers in short spikes, solitary or more often in heads. Both ''[[Lachnaea]]'', ''[[Passerina]]'' and a few ''Gnidia''-species lack scales on the calyx tubes. Both ''S. striata'' and ''S. tetralepis'' have four petal-like scales implanted at the opening of the calyx tube, while the many dozens of remaining ''Struthiola'' species have eight or twelve scales. ''S. striata'' is a roundish shrub of up to 1.5 m high with cream, soft yellow or pinkish flowers ending in oval sepal lobes of 1\u20132&nbsp;mm long and 1.5\u20132.5&nbsp;mm wide, and a reddish wart on the tip of the anthers, ''S. tetralepis'' is a single stemmed shrublet of up to {{cvt|30|cm|ft}} high that has initially greenish yellow, later brownish red flowers with lance-shaped sepal lobes of {{cvt|2\u20133|mm|in}} long and {{cvt|0.5\u20131.0|mm|in}} wide, and a white wart on the anthers.<ref name=FGtF>{{cite book|first= John|last= Manning|year= 2007|title= Field Guide to Fynbos|publisher= Random House Struik|location= Cape Town|pages= 236\u2013245}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution, ecology and conservation ==\n''Struthiola striata'' is restricted to coast of the Western Cape province of South Africa, between [[Yzerfontein]] in the north and [[Mossel Bay]] in the east.
