The {{Nihongo|'''Family Computer'''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf|Famir\u012b Konpy\u016bta|lead=yes}} or {{Nihongo|'''Famicom'''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3|Famikon}} was developed in 1982 and launched in 1983 in Japan. Following the North American [[video game crash of 1983]], the Famicom was adapted into the NES which was brazenly launched in North America in 1985. Transitioning the company from its [[arcade game]] history into this combined global [[8-bit]] [[home video game console]] platform, the Famicom and NES continued to aggressively compete with the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|next-generation 16-bit consoles]] including the 1988 [[Sega Genesis]]. The platform was succeeded by the Super Famicom in 1990 and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1991, but its support and production continued until 1995. Interest in the NES has been renewed by collectors and [[Console emulator|emulators]], including Nintendo's own [[Virtual Console]] platform.\n\n==Origins (1982\u20131984)==\n[[File:Nintendo-Famicom-Console-Set-FL.png|thumb|Family Computer (Japan)]]\nThe North American video game market experienced a period of rapid growth and unprecedented popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Consoles such as the [[Atari 2600]] and the [[Intellivision]] proved to be wildly popular, and many third-party developers arose in their wake to exploit the growing industry. Nintendo was one such development studio, and, by 1982 had found success with a number of [[arcade game]]s, such as ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'', which was in turn ported to, and packaged with the [[ColecoVision]] console in North America.\n\nLed by [[Masayuki Uemura]], Nintendo's R&D team had been secretly working on a system since 1980, ambitiously targeted to be less expensive than its competitors, yet with performance that could not be surpassed by its competitors for at least a year.<ref name=\"Turner/Nutt 2\">{{Cite book |last=Turner |first=Benjamin |last2=Nutt |first2=Christian |date=July 15, 2003 |chapter=Building the Ultimate Game Machine |chapter-url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/index2.shtml |title=Nintendo Famicom: 20 Years of Fun! |publisher=GameSpy |page=7 |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040805160509/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/index2.shtml |archive-date=August 5, 2004 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Uemura initially thought of using a modern [[16-bit]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], but instead settled on the inexpensive [[MOS Technology 6502]], supplementing it with a custom [[graphics processing unit|graphics chip]] (the [[Picture Processing Unit]]).<ref name=\"liedholm1\" /> To keep costs down, suggestions of including a [[keyboard (computing)|keyboard]], [[modem]], and [[floppy disk]] drive were rejected, but expensive circuitry was added to provide a versatile 15-[[pin]] expansion [[Computer port (hardware)|port]] connection on the front of the console for future add-on functionality such as [[peripheral device]]s.\n\nThe keyboard, [[Famicom Modem]], and [[Family Computer Disk System|Famicom Disk System]] would later be released as add-on peripherals, all utilizing the Famicom expansion port.

The software carries the [[Nintendo Seal of Quality]] to communicate the company's approval.\n\nNintendo's product designer Lance Barr, who would continue with the company for decades, retooled the Famicom console with a sleek and sophisticated design language. The toy-like white-and-red color scheme of the Famicom was replaced with a clean and futuristic color scheme of grey, black, and red. The top and bottom portions are in different shades of grey, plus a stripe with black and ribbing along the top, and minor red accents. The shape is boxier: flat on top, and a bottom half that tapered down to a smaller footprint.

In 1987, [[NEC]] and [[Hudson Soft]] released the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]], and in 1988, [[Sega]] released the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit]] [[Mega Drive]]. Both were introduced in North America in 1989, where they were respectively marketed as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis. Facing new competition from the PC Engine in Japan, and the Genesis in North America, Nintendo's market share began to erode. Nintendo responded in the form of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] (Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America and Europe), the Famicom's 16-bit successor, in 1990. Although Nintendo announced its intention to continue to support the Famicom alongside its newer console, the success of the newer offering began to draw even more gamers and developers from the NES, whose decline accelerated. Nintendo did continue support of the NES for about three years after the September 1991 release of the Super NES, with the NES's final [[First-party developer|first-party]] games being ''[[Zoda's Revenge: StarTropics II]]'' and ''[[Wario's Woods]]''.\n\nA revised Famicom (HVC-101 model) was released in Japan in 1993. It takes some design cues from the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]].

The {{Nihongo|'''Family Computer'''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf|Famir\u012b Konpy\u016bta|lead=yes}} or {{Nihongo|'''Famicom'''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b3\u30f3|Famikon}} was developed in 1982 and launched in 1983 in Japan. Following the North American [[video game crash of 1983]], the Famicom was adapted into the NES which was brazenly launched in North America in 1985. Transitioning the company from its [[arcade game]] history into this combined global [[8-bit]] [[home video game console]] platform, the Famicom and NES continued to aggressively compete with the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|next-generation 16-bit consoles]] including the 1988 [[Sega Genesis]]. The platform was succeeded by the Super Famicom in 1990 and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1991, but its support and production continued until 1995. Interest in the NES has been renewed by collectors and [[Console emulator|emulators]], including Nintendo's own [[Virtual Console]] platform.\n\n==Origins (1982\u20131984)==\n[[File:Nintendo-Famicom-Console-Set-FL.png|thumb|Family Computer (Japan)]]\nThe North American video game market experienced a period of rapid growth and unprecedented popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Consoles such as the [[Atari 2600]] and the [[Intellivision]] proved to be wildly popular, and many third-party developers arose in their wake to exploit the growing industry. Nintendo was one such development studio, and, by 1982 had found success with a number of [[arcade game]]s, such as ''[[Donkey Kong (arcade game)|Donkey Kong]]'', which was in turn ported to, and packaged with the [[ColecoVision]] console in North America.\n\nLed by [[Masayuki Uemura]], Nintendo's R&D team had been secretly working on a system since 1980, ambitiously targeted to be less expensive than its competitors, yet with performance that could not be surpassed by its competitors for at least a year.<ref name=\"Turner/Nutt 2\">{{Cite book |last=Turner |first=Benjamin |last2=Nutt |first2=Christian |date=July 15, 2003 |chapter=Building the Ultimate Game Machine |chapter-url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/index2.shtml |title=Nintendo Famicom: 20 Years of Fun! |publisher=GameSpy |page=7 |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040805160509/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/july03/famicom/index2.shtml |archive-date=August 5, 2004 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Uemura initially thought of using a modern [[16-bit]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], but instead settled on the inexpensive [[MOS Technology 6502]], supplementing it with a custom [[graphics processing unit|graphics chip]] (the [[Picture Processing Unit]]).<ref name=\"liedholm1\" /> To keep costs down, suggestions of including a [[keyboard (computing)|keyboard]], [[modem]], and [[floppy disk]] drive were rejected, but expensive circuitry was added to provide a versatile 15-[[pin]] expansion [[Computer port (hardware)|port]] connection on the front of the console for future add-on functionality such as [[peripheral device]]s.\n\nThe keyboard, [[Famicom Modem]], and [[Family Computer Disk System|Famicom Disk System]] would later be released as add-on peripherals, all utilizing the Famicom expansion port.

Disappointed with the cosmetically raw prototype part they received from Japan, which they nicknamed \"the lunchbox\", Nintendo of America designers Lance Barr and Don James added the two-tone gray, the black stripe, and the red lettering.<ref name=\"In Their Words\"/> To obscure the video game connotation, NES replaced the top-loading cartridge slot of the Famicom and AVS with a front-loading chamber for software cartridges that place the inserted cartridge out of view, reminiscent of a [[VCR]]. The Famicom's pair of hard-wired controllers, and the AVS's wireless controllers, were replaced with two custom 7-pin sockets for detachable wired controllers.<ref name=\"AVS Nintendo\">{{cite web|title=The Game System That Almost Wasn't|url=https://www.nintendo.com/newsroom/articles/nes/index.html|website=Nintendo Power Source|publisher=Nintendo of America|accessdate=2 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971012013943/http://www.nintendo.com/newsroom/articles/nes/index.html|archivedate=October 12, 1997}}</ref>\n\nUsing another approach to market the system to North American retailers as an \"entertainment system\", as opposed to a video game console, Nintendo positioned the NES more squarely as a toy, emphasizing the [[NES Zapper|Zapper]] [[light gun]], and more significantly, [[R.O.B.]] (Robotic Operating Buddy), a wireless [[toy robot]] that responds to special screen flashes with mechanized actions.<ref name=\"Rise of Nintendo\" /> Although R.O.B. successfully drew a stream of retailers to Nintendo's Summer 1985 CES booth to see the NES, they were still unwilling to sign up to distribute the console.<ref name=\"goldberg\" />\n\n====North American launch (1985-1986)====\n{{quote box | align=right | width=25% | text=Mr. Arakawa really had this focus ... if it's going to work in New York, it will spread.

In 1987, [[NEC]] and [[Hudson Soft]] released the [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]], and in 1988, [[Sega]] released the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit]] [[Mega Drive]]. Both were introduced in North America in 1989, where they were respectively marketed as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Genesis. Facing new competition from the PC Engine in Japan, and the Genesis in North America, Nintendo's market share began to erode. Nintendo responded in the form of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] (Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America and Europe), the Famicom's 16-bit successor, in 1990. Although Nintendo announced its intention to continue to support the Famicom alongside its newer console, the success of the newer offering began to draw even more gamers and developers from the NES, whose decline accelerated. Nintendo did continue support of the NES for about three years after the September 1991 release of the Super NES, with the NES's final [[First-party developer|first-party]] games being ''[[Zoda's Revenge: StarTropics II]]'' and ''[[Wario's Woods]]''.\n\nA revised Famicom (HVC-101 model) was released in Japan in 1993. It takes some design cues from the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]. The HVC-101 model replaces the original HVC-001 model's [[RF modulator]] with [[RCA connector|RCA]] [[composite video|composite audio/video]] output, eliminates the hardwired controllers, and features a more compact case design. Retailing for \u00a54,800 to \u00a57,200 (equivalent to approximately $42 to $60 USD), the HVC-101 model remained in production for almost a decade before being finally discontinued in 2003.<ref name=\"avfami\">{{cite web |title=AV Family Computer |website={{!}}tsr's NES archive | url=http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/fc/avfami.html |accessdate=February 12, 2006}}</ref> The case design of the AV Famicom was adopted for a subsequent North American rerelease of the NES. The [[Nintendo Entertainment System (redesigned model)|NES-101 model]] differs from the Japanese HVC-101 model in that it omits the RCA composite output connectors of the original NES-001 model, and sports only RF output capabilities.<ref name=\"nes2\">{{cite web |title=Nintendo Entertainment System 2 |website=Vidgame.net |url=http://www.vidgame.net/NINTENDO/NES2.html |accessdate=February 12, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202132819/http://www.vidgame.net/NINTENDO/NES2.html |archive-date=February 2, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[ASCII Entertainment]] reported in early 1993 that stores still offered 100 NES games, compared to 100 on shelves for Genesis and 50 for SNES.<ref name=\"wilson199306\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=107|title=The Software Publishing Association Spring Symposium 1993|last=Wilson|first=Johnny L.|date=June 1993|work=Computer Gaming World|accessdate=July 7, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702235945/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=107|archivedate=July 2, 2014|url-status=live|page=96}}</ref> After a full decade of production, the NES was formally discontinued in the U.S. in 1995.<ref name=\"nielsen\" /> By the end of its run, more than 60 million NES units had been sold throughout the world.<ref name=\"sales\">{{cite web |title={{!}} Nintendo - Corporate Information {{!}} Company History |website=Nintendo.com |url=https://www.nintendo.com/corp/history.jsp |accessdate=November 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Discontinuation and emulation (1995\u2013present)==\n{{refimprove section |date=December 2014}}\n[[File:Nesticle.jpg|thumb|Bloodlust Software's NESticle]]\nThe NES's market presence declined from 1991 to 1995, with the Sega Genesis and Nintendo's own Super NES gaining market share, with next-generation [[CD-ROM]]-based systems forthcoming. Even though the NES was discontinued in North America in 1995, many millions of cartridges for the system existed. The secondhand market of video rental stores, thrift stores, yard sales, flea markets, and games repackaged by Game Time Inc. / Game Trader Inc. and sold at retail stores such as [[K-Mart]], was burgeoning. Many people began to rediscover the NES around this time, and by 1997, many older NES games were becoming popular with collectors.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nAt the same time, [[computer programmer]]s began to develop [[Console emulator|emulators]] capable of reproducing the internal workings of the NES on modern personal computers. When paired with a [[ROM image]] (a [[bit]]-for-bit copy of a NES cartridge's program code), the games can be played on a computer. Emulators also come with a variety of built-in functions that change the gaming experience, such as [[Saved game|save states]] which allow the player to save and resume progress at an exact spot in the game.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nNintendo did not respond positively to these developments and became one of the most vocal opponents of ROM image trading. Nintendo and its supporters claim that such trading represents blatant [[Copyright infringement of software|software piracy]].<ref name=\"legalfaq\">{{cite web |title={{!}} Nintendo - Corporate Information {{!}} Legal Information (Copyrights, Emulators, ROMs, etc.) |website=Nintendo.com |url=https://www.nintendo.com/corp/legal.jsp |accessdate=December 28, 2014}}</ref> Proponents of ROM image trading argue that emulation preserves many classic games for future generations, outside of their more fragile cartridge formats.<ref name=\"pettus\">{{citation |last=Pettus |first=Sam |date=10 March 2000 |title=Emulation: Right or Wrong? |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/EmuFAQ2000/ |chapter=Module One: The Emulator {{!}} Part 1 - The Basis for Emulation |chapter-url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/EmuFAQ2000/EmuFAQ_M1P1.htm |edition=Final |accessdate=November 2, 2015 |via=[http://www.worldofspectrum.org/ World of Spectrum]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Nintendo announced plans to make classic NES titles available on the [[Virtual Console]] download service for the [[Wii]] console, which is based on their own emulation technology.

Edge, however, countered Cena's moves with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Lariat takedown|neckbreaker]]. The match saw Cena sandwich Edge in a ladder as he applied the [[Professional wrestling holds#STS|STFU]] on Edge, to which Edge submitted. At one point, Cena began to climb the ladder, as he was moments away from retrieving the title, Lita, who interfered on Edge's behalf, tipped the ladder over, making Cena fall off the ladder through a table at ringside. Lita's interference was short, as Cena would later recover, and as Edge was climbing the ladder, Lita hit Cena with a steel chair to the back, only for him to inadvertently fall towards and push the ladder, making Edge fall off the ladder through a table at ringside. Lita then received an [[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry slam|FU]] off Cena. Cena then began to make his way up the ladder, as did Edge when he re-entered the ring.

Van Dam, however, managed to execute a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Crossbody|crossbody]] on Edge inside the ring, resulting in the two landing on the outside of the ring floor. Both men took the upper hand in the match, until Van Dam was scripted to knock the referee unconscious. Edge took advantage, as Lita gave him the title.

Edge, however, got the advantage as he attempted to perform a shoulder block takedown on Van Dam, while Lita propped a chair on a ring corner. Edge went for the shoulder block takedown, but Van Dam moved out of the way, resulting in Edge to crash head-first onto the chair. Capitalizing on the situation, Van Dam then performed a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frog splash|Five Star Frog Splash]] from the top turnbuckle on Edge, which he followed with a cover and a pinfall, thus retaining the WWE Championship.<ref name=\"green\"/><ref name=\"RVD\">{{cite web|date=2006-06-25|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nightofchampions/history/2006/matches/2590012/results/|title=Still the Champion|accessdate=2007-12-22|first=Brett|last= Hoffman|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nThe sixth match was a singles match between [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] versus [[Drew Hankinson|Impostor Kane]].

Before the match began, the ECW and Raw superstars made their way to ringside to take their place as lumberjacks. The match quickly began with Cena throwing Sabu out of the ring onto the Raw lumberjacks, in which they assaulted Sabu and threw him back in the ring. Sabu would later get the upper hand and throw Cena out onto the ECW lumberjacks, at ringside. Throughout the match, Sabu took the advantage over Cena as he performed a [[Leg drop#Somersault leg drop|somersault leg drop]], driving a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Chair shot|steel chair]] onto Cena's face. Cena got the upper hand when he was able to counter a flying crossbody attempt by Sabu. Mid-way in the match, the ECW and Raw lumberjacks started brawling at ringside. At ringside, the ECW lumberjacks began their assault on Cena, after he was hit with a steel chair by Sabu. They laid his head on a table, in which Sabu attempted to perform a high-flying maneuver. The Raw superstars, however, gave Cena the upper hand to hit Sabu with a [[Shinai|kendo stick]] in mid-air. Back in the ring, Cena hit Sabu with a steel chair then lifted him over his shoulders and threw him down on a table that was at ringside to execute the [[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry takeover|FU]].

The match was then controlled by the Spirit Squad, after Johnny performed an [[Professional wrestling attacks#Enzuigiri|enzuigiri]] on Michaels. Nicky, who was tagged in, distracted the referee, allowing the other squad members to pull Michaels out of the ring and hit Michaels with a steel chair. Back in the ring, the assault continued, as each member took the upper hand over him.

Red Shrimp can just be seen as the two black dots between the tailpipes of 3 & 4 engines, uppermost in this photo.]]\n'''Red Shrimp''' was the airborne high-bandwidth [[:en:radar jammer|radar jammer]] fitted to the [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan]] and [[Handley Page Victor|Victor]]. The name was one of the [[:en:Rainbow Code|Rainbow Code]]s.\n\n== Operation ==\nRed Shrimp (or ARI 18076<ref name=\"Roberts\" />{{efn-lr|ARI: Airborne Radio Installation<ref name=\"MOD, Acronyms\" />}}) was a wide-coverage jammer for radar between 2.5\u20133&nbsp;GHz.<ref name=\"Powell, 2005\" /> This is in what was described as [[:en:S band|S band]] at the time (1&nbsp;GHz - 3&nbsp;GHz), but is now termed the [[:en:D band (NATO)|D]] and [[:en:E band (NATO)|E]] frequency bands. It was based on a [[:en:carcinotron|carcinotron]] or [[:en:backward-wave oscillator|backward-wave oscillator]] (BWO) valve. This is a variable frequency voltage-controlled wide-range oscillator. Changing the control voltage, without requiring any mechanical adjustment, could produce a high-power jamming signal which could be adjusted rapidly to jam any radar frequency.\n\nThe main target for the jamming was the [[:en:Fan Song|Fan Song radar]], the target acquisition radar of the [[:en:S-75 Dvina|S-75 Dvina]] (NATO: [[:en:SA-2 Guideline|SA-2 Guideline]]) surface-to-air missile. The [[:en:Blue Diver|Blue Diver]] jammers targeted its [[:en:Knife Rest|Knife Rest targeting radar]].<ref name=\"Haynes\" />\n\nThe Red Shrimp antenna was quite small and housed in a downward-pointing hemispherical dome, approximately 6 inches in diameter. These were of dielectric material coloured black or dark grey and unpainted. Their signal was broadcast downwards as a cone of around 45\u00b0 included angle.{{sfn|RAF Historical Society, 28|page=77}} Later on, as the aircraft switched to operating at extremely low level, this gave a ground coverage patch barely larger than the aircraft's shadow.{{sfn|RAF Historical Society, 28|page=77}}\n\n== Fitment ==\n=== Valiant ===\nThe first Red Shrimp fitment was to a [[:en:Vickers Valiant|Valiant]] of the [[:en:Bomber Command Development Unit|Bomber Command Development Unit]].<ref name=\"Brookes, 45\" /> The BCDU was a development unit which operated Valiant WP214 from the end of 1955 as a trials aircraft.\n\nBy mid-1958 the [[:en:Electronic Counter-Measures|Electronic Counter-Measures]] (ECM){{efn-lr|Termed RCM at the time, for Radar Counter Measures<ref name=\"Brookes, 45\" />}} fitment which would become standard for the V bombers had been developed. Equipment was mounted in a series of sealed cylindrical drums, each weighing around 200&nbsp;lbs, the limit of what could be manhandled for servicing. These were installed in the tail of the aircraft and slid into place on an overhead trolley rail. A water-glycol cooling system, the Vapour Cycle Cooling Pack (VCCP), was used to cool the equipment, with a large external cooling air intake. An additional AC power system was added to supply enough electrical power. Rather than being engine-driven, this was an air-powered turbo-alternator.{{sfnp|Brookes|2012|pages= 45-46}}\n\n==== 18 Squadron ====\nFrom 1958 to 1963 [[:en:No. 18 Squadron RAF#Post war|18 Squadron]] operated as a dedicated ECM squadron, having been formed from the [[:en:Vickers Valiant|Valiant]]-equipped C flight of [[:en:No. 199 Squadron RAF|199 Squadron]], which had developed the role post-war.<ref name=\"Jefford\" /> These seven{{efn-lr|WP213, WZ365, WZ372, WP212, WP215, WP216 & WP211, in order of conversion at [[:en:RAF Watton|RAF Watton]] {{sfnp|Brookes|2012|page= 46}}}} were the only ECM-equipped Valiants. The initial intention for these aircraft was that they would be used for training UK air defences, simulating a Soviet ECM-using threat. Any idea of a war role for them, as an ECM escort for an attack force of Valiant bombers, developed later. This also required 18 Squadron to start training for the same [[Quick Reaction Alert|QRA]] 'scramble' exercises as the Bomber Command main force.{{sfnp|Brookes|2012|pages= 45-48}}\n\nThe S band jammer of the 18 Squadron Valiants was the [[magnetron]]-based US-made AN/APT-16A jammer. This was a much simpler and less capable system, without the frequency agility of the carcinotron devices. The Carpet 4 (ARI 18030, AN/APT-5) spot jammer, had been trialled in Lincolns and also the 18 Squadron Valiants, but it was unreliable and ineffective, so never used.\n\nThe electrical supply of the Valiant was also a limitation. The Valiant and first Vulcans had a 112&nbsp;V DC electrical system, although the trials aircraft had a more powerful 240&nbsp;V AC system. The DC system was not powerful enough to supply active ECM, such as Red Shrimp, and so those aircraft were limited to the radar warning receivers and chaff dispensers.{{sfnp|Brookes|2012|page=46}} This omission was never upgraded, as the Valiant's service life was so short.\n\nFrom 1958, the new 18 Squadron were based at [[:en:RAF Finningley|RAF Finningley]], South Yorkshire, as was the BCDU. [[Nick Prager]], a Czech-born sergeant with the BCDU in the ECM servicing section of the base, together with his wife Jana, supplied photographs of the ECM manual set{{efn-lr|Blue Diver and Red Steer were the systems most affected.}} to the [[:en:Czech Intelligence Service|Czech Intelligence Service]]. He was arrested for this in 1971, after betrayal by the defector [[:en:Josef Frol\u00edk|Josef Frol\u00edk]], and sentenced to 12 years for spying.<ref name=\"Turner, Prager\" /> [[:en:No. 230 Operational Conversion Unit RAF|230 OCU]], the training unit for Vulcan crews, was also based at Finningley from 1961.\n\nAs it became clear that the new low-level penetration role would involve bombers travelling singly, each bomber would need its own ECM fit. The squadron retained a development and training role for some time, but this could be performed by simpler aircraft, such as [[:en:English Electric Canberra|Canberra]]s, than the Valiants and so 18 Squadron was disbanded in 1963.{{sfn|RAF Historical Society, 28|page=69}}\n\n=== Vulcan ===\n==== Vulcan B.1 ====\nThe original [[:en:Vulcan B.1|Vulcan B.1]] had a fairly simple ECM fit, with little more than chaff dispensers and the [[:en:Orange Putter|Orange Putter]] tail warning receiver from the Canberra and Valiant.<ref name=\"Darling, 35\" />\n\nAdditional equipment could be carried along the side walls of the bomb bay, in a series of up to nine containers. These included the [[Green Palm]] VHF voice communications jammer, [[Indigo Bracket]], an early carcinotron-based jammer, and [[Red Carpet (ECM)|Red Carpet]] X-band{{efn-lr|X band, 6,200 \u2013 10,900&nbsp;MHz. This is the old NATO designation for X band, now split into [[:en:H band (NATO)|H band]] and [[:en:I band (NATO)|I band]], with X band also used for a different but overlapping band.

Red Shrimp can just be seen as the two black dots between the tailpipes of 3 & 4 engines, uppermost in this photo.]]\n'''Red Shrimp''' was the airborne high-bandwidth [[:en:radar jammer|radar jammer]] fitted to the [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan]] and [[Handley Page Victor|Victor]]. The name was one of the [[:en:Rainbow Code|Rainbow Code]]s.\n\n== Operation ==\nRed Shrimp (or ARI 18076<ref name=\"Roberts\" />{{efn-lr|ARI: Airborne Radio Installation<ref name=\"MOD, Acronyms\" />}}) was a wide-coverage jammer for radar between 2.5-3 GHz.<ref name=\"Powell, 2005\" /> This is in what was described as [[:en:S band|S band]] at the time (1 GHz - 3 GHz), but is now termed the [[:en:D band (NATO)|D]] and [[:en:E band (NATO)|E]] frequency bands. It was based on a [[:en:carcinotron|carcinotron]] or [[:en:backward-wave oscillator|backward-wave oscillator]] (BWO) valve. This is a variable frequency voltage-controlled wide-range oscillator. Changing the control voltage, without requiring any mechanical adjustment, could produce a high-power jamming signal which could be adjusted rapidly to jam any radar frequency.\n\nThe main target for the jamming was the [[:en:Fan Song|Fan Song radar]], the target acquisition radar of the [[:en:S-75 Dvina|S-75 Dvina]] (NATO: [[:en:SA-2 Guideline|SA-2 Guideline]]) surface-to-air missile. The [[:en:Blue Diver|Blue Diver]] jammers targeted its [[:en:Knife Rest|Knife Rest targetting radar]].<ref name=\"Haynes\" />\n\nThe Red Shrimp antenna was quite small and housed in a downward-pointing hemispherical dome, approximately 6 inches in diameter. These were of dielectric material coloured black or dark grey and unpainted. Their signal was broadcast downwards as a cone of around 45\u00b0 included angle.{{sfn|RAF Historical Society, 28|page=77}} Later on, as the aircraft switched to operating at extremely low level, this gave a ground coverage patch barely larger than the aircraft's shadow.{{sfn|RAF Historical Society, 28|page=77}}\n\n== Fitment ==\n=== Valiant ===\nThe first Red Shrimp fitment was to a [[:en:Vickers Valiant|Valiant]] of the [[:en:Bomber Command Development Unit|Bomber Command Development Unit]].<ref name=\"Brookes, 45\" /> The BCDU was a development unit which operated Valiant WP214 from the end of 1955 as a trials aircraft. \n\nBy mid-1958 the [[:en:Electronic Counter-Measures|Electronic Counter-Measures]] (ECM){{efn-lr|Termed RCM at the time, for Radar Counter Measures<ref name=\"Brookes, 45\" />}} fitment which would become standard for the V bombers had been developed. Equipment was mounted in a series of sealed cylindrical drums, each weighing around 200 lbs, the limit of what could be manhandled for servicing. These were installed in the tail of the aircraft and slid into place on an overhead trolley rail. A water-glycol cooling system, the Vapour Cycle Cooling Pack (VCCP), was used to cool the equipment, with a large external cooling air intake. An additional AC power system was added to supply enough electrical power. Rather than being engine-driven, this was an air-powered turbo-alternator.{{sfnp|Brookes|2012|pages= 45-46}}\n\n==== 18 Squadron ====\nFrom 1958 to 1963 [[:en:No. 18 Squadron RAF#Post war|18 Squadron]] operated as a dedicated ECM squadron, having been formed from the [[:en:Vickers Valiant|Valiant]]-equipped C flight of [[:en:No. 199 Squadron RAF|199 Squadron]], which had developed the role post-war.<ref name=\"Jefford\" /> These seven{{efn-lr|WP213, WZ365, WZ372, WP212, WP215, WP216 & WP211, in order of conversion at [[:en:RAF Watton|RAF Watton]] {{sfnp|Brookes|2012|page= 46}}}} were the only ECM-equipped Valiants. The initial intention for these aircraft was that they would be used for training UK air defences, simulating a Soviet ECM-using threat. Any idea of a war role for them, as an ECM escort for an attack force of Valiant bombers, developed later. This also required 18 Squadron to start training for the same [[Quick Reaction Alert|QRA]] 'scramble' exercises as the Bomber Command main force.{{sfnp|Brookes|2012|pages= 45-48}}\n\nThe S band jammer of the 18 Squadron Valiants was the [[magnetron]]-based US-made AN/APT-16A jammer. This was a much simpler and less capable system, without the frequency agility of the carcinotron devices. The Carpet 4 (ARI 18030, AN/APT-5) spot jammer, had been trialled in Lincolns and also the 18 Squadron Valiants, but it was unreliable and ineffective, so never used.\n\nThe electrical supply of the Valiant was also a limitation. The Valiant and first Vulcans had a 112&nbsp;V DC electrical system, although the trials aircraft had a more powerful 240&nbsp;V AC system. The DC system was not powerful enough to supply active ECM, such as Red Shrimp, and so those aircraft were limited to the radar warning receivers and chaff dispensers.{{sfnp|Brookes|2012|page=46}} This omission was never upgraded, as the Valiant's service life was so short.\n\nFrom 1958, the new 18 Squadron were based at [[:en:RAF Finningley|RAF Finningley]], South Yorkshire, as was the BCDU. [[Nick Prager]], a Czech-born sergeant with the BCDU in the ECM servicing section of the base, together with his wife Jana, supplied photographs of the ECM manual set{{efn-lr|Blue Diver and Red Steer were the systems most affected.}} to the [[:en:Czech Intelligence Service|Czech Intelligence Service]]. He was arrested for this in 1971, after betrayal by the defector [[:en:Josef Frol\u00edk|Josef Frol\u00edk]], and sentenced to 12 years for spying.<ref name=\"Turner, Prager\" /> [[:en:No. 230 Operational Conversion Unit RAF|230 OCU]], the training unit for Vulcan crews, was also based at Finningley from 1961.\n\nAs it became clear that the new low-level penetration role would involve bombers travelling singly, each bomber would need its own ECM fit. The squadron retained a development and training role for some time, but this could be performed by simpler aircraft, such as [[:en:English Electric Canberra|Canberra]]s, than the Valiants and so 18 Squadron was disbanded in 1963.{{sfn|RAF Historical Society, 28|page=69}}\n\n=== Vulcan ===\n==== Vulcan B.1 ====\nThe original [[:en:Vulcan B.1|Vulcan B.1]] had a fairly simple ECM fit, with little more than chaff dispensers and the [[:en:Orange Putter|Orange Putter]] tail warning receiver from the Canberra and Valiant.<ref name=\"Darling, 35\" />\n\nAdditional equipment could be carried along the side walls of the bomb bay, in a series of up to nine containers. These included the [[Green Palm]] VHF voice communications jammer, [[Indigo Bracket]], an early carcinotron-based jammer, and [[Red Carpet (ECM)|Red Carpet]] X-band{{efn-lr|X band, 6,200 \u2013 10,900&nbsp;MHz.

The anticipated Argentinian threat of [[:en:Super Fledermaus|Super Fledermaus]], [[:en:Skyguard radar|Skyguard]] AA cannon and [[:en:Roland (missile)|Roland]] were expected to be capable of defeating it, at least at close range.  The Vulcans thus borrowed US-made [[:en:AN/ALQ-101|AN/ALQ-101D]] [[:en:deflection jammer|deflection jammer]] pods and trained with them over the [[:en:RAF Spadeadam|Spadeadam]] range.{{sfnp|White|2007|page=211}} As a result, the Black Buck missions left Red Shrimp unused and relied on the Dash 10.{{sfnp|White|2007|page=331}}\n\n=== Victor ===\nFrom the twenty four B.1A conversions, the [[Handley Page Victor|Victor]] had the same EW fit as the Vulcan, with Red Steer, Blue Saga, Green Palm, Blue Diver, Red Shrimp and chaff dispensers.<ref >{{Cite web\n  |title=The Handley Page Victor\n  |url=http://www.airvectors.net/avvictor.html#m1\n}}</ref>\n\n=== TSR2 ===\nDesign studies during the early development of [[BAC TSR-2|TSR2]] recommended the provision of an X-band carcinotron, such as Red Shrimp, in the aircraft, or at least the provision of space for one. However budget constraints led to this provisison being removed from the formal requirement. Naval / Air Staff Target 830 for future jamming provision was still under consideration at the time the TSR2 project was cancelled. The likelihood was that TSR2 would use pylon-carried external equipment, if the mission required it.<ref name=\"Brookes, 2017, TSR2 ECM\" />\n\n== Controls ==\nControls for Red Shrimp, the control unit Type 9422, were simple and amounted to little more than switches to turn it on and off, to switch the two automatic operating modes, and to monitor its performance, current draw and temperature. It was controlled by a small panel on the AEO's lower desk, at the right of the rear cockpit (facing the rear).{{sfn|Haynes, Vulcan|pages=106,108,110\u2013111}}<ref name=\"XL426 cockpit detail\" />\n\n== See also ==\n* [[:en:List of Rainbow Codes|List of Rainbow Codes]]\n* [[:en:RX12874|RX12874]] or 'Winkle', a passive-detection system intended to counteract carcinotron jamming<ref name=\"Haynes\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Notelist-lr}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Brookes, 45\" >{{Cite book\n  |title=Valiant Units of the Cold War\n  |first=Andrew  |last=Brookes\n  |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing\n  |year=2012\n  |isbn=9781849087544\n  |ref=harv\n  |page=45\n  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=n-S6CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MOD, Acronyms\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=MOD Acronyms and Abbreviations\n  |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence|MOD]]\n  |page=32\n  |url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/227048/acronyms_and_abbreviations_dec08.pdf\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Jefford\" >{{Cite journal\n  |title=EW In The Early Post-War Years \u2013 Lincolns To Valiants\n  |author=Wing Commander \u2018Jeff\u2019 Jefford\n  |id=Journal 28\n  |journal=RAF Historical Society\n  |year=2003\n  |issn=1361-4231\n  |ref={{harvid|RAF Historical Society, 28}}\n  |url=https://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/documents/Research/RAF-Historical-Society-Journals/Journal-28-Seminar-Electronic-Warfare.pdf\n  |pages=58\u201368\n}}</ref> \n\n<ref name=\"Flintham, 182\" >{{Cite book\n  |title=High Stakes: Britain's Air Arms in Action 1945-1990\n  |first=Vic  |last=Flintham\n  |publisher=Pen and Sword\n  |year=2008\n  |isbn=9781844158157\n  |ref=harv\n  |page=182\n  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ohzOAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA182&lpg=PA182\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Haynes\" >{{Cite book\n  |title=Avro Vulcan\n  |publisher=Haynes Publishing\n  |year=2016\n  |isbn=978-1-78521-083-9\n  |ref={{harvid|Haynes, Vulcan}}\n  |pages=106,108,110\u2013111\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Darling, 35\" >{{Cite book\n  |title=Avro Vulcan, Part 1\n  |first=Kev  |last=Darling\n  |year=2007\n  |isbn=1847992374\n  |page=35\n  |ref=harv\n  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wdM5wJlVhpcC&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Darling, 2012, 46\" >{{Cite book\n  |title=RAF Strike Command, 1968-2007\n  |first=Kev  |last=Darling\n  |publisher=Casemate Publishers\n  |year=2012\n  |isbn=1848848986\n  |ref=harv\n  |page=46\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"White, 2007\" >{{Cite book\n  |title=Vulcan 607\n  |first=Rowland  |last=White\n  |publisher=Corgi\n  |year=2007\n  |isbn=9780552152297\n  |ref=harv\n  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1f1ri0doU9YC&pg=PA523&lpg=PA523\n  |pages=199,211,331\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Powell, 2005\" >{{Cite journal\n  |title=Early Warning During the V-Force Era\n  |journal=Royal  Air  Force  Historical  Society \n  |author=Wg Cdr Rod Powell\n  |pages=8-11\n  |date=Winter 2005\n  |via=XM655\n  |url=https://xm655.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Newsletter-14-Winter-2005.pdf\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Roberts\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=Radar & EW in the RAF\n  |author=Prof. Steve Roberts\n  |publisher=[[RAF Cranfield]]\n  |year=2014\n  |page=24\n  |url=https://www.cambridgewireless.co.uk/media/uploads/resources/Heritage%20Group/16.10.15/Heritage-16.10.15-SelexES-Steve_Roberts.pdf\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Dancey, 96\" >{{Cite book\n  |title=The Avro Vulcan\n  |first=Peter G.  |last=Dancey\n  |publisher=Fonthill\n  |year=2014\n  |isbn=1781552320\n  |ref=harv\n  |pages=96\n  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SCX5DQAAQBAJ&pg=PT96&lpg=PT96\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"XL426 cockpit detail\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=Vulcan Cockpit (XL426) - In Detail\n  |date=1 October 2009\n  |website=UK Airshow Review\n  |url=https://forums.airshows.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=16451\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Turner, Prager\" >{{Cite book\n  |title=Traitor: British Double Agents 1930-80\n  |first=John Frayn  |last=Turner\n  |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing\n  |year=2012\n  |isbn=1780967292\n  |ref=harv\n  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uonvCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT132&lpg=PT132\n}}</ref>\n\n\n<ref name=\"Brookes, 2017, TSR2 ECM\" >{{Cite book\n  |title=TSR2: Britain's Lost Cold War Strike Jet\n  |first=Andrew  |last=Brookes\n  |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing\n  |year=2017\n  |isbn=9781472822482\n  |ref=harv\n  |pages=70-71\n  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oMA2DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70\n}}</ref>\n\n\n}}\n\n[[Category:Cold War military equipment of the United Kingdom|Rainbow Codes]]\n[[Category:Avro Vulcan]]\n", "name_user": "Nat965", "label": "safe", "comment": "ApplyGen fix(es),typo(s) fixed: targetting \u2192 targeting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Shrimp"}

They may be covered with toppings such as chopped [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[sprinkles]], [[sugar]] and crushed [[cookies]].\n\n==History==\n\nDon Phillips, also known as the frozen banana king, opened the first frozen banana stand - The Original Frozen Banana - on [[Balboa Peninsula]], located in [[Orange County, California]], circa 1940.  In 1963, Bob Teller, who moved to the area with plans to manufacture car [[seat belts]], instead opened a frozen banana stand after being inspired by Phillips' success.  Teller opened his stand - The Original Banana Rolla Rama - right across the street from Phillips' original shop.<ref name=\"balboa\">{{Cite web  | last = Brunner | first = Jessie | title = Sunday Story: Frozen in history | url = http://articles.dailypilot.com/2007-03-17/features/dpt-fronana18_1_ripe-bananas-balboa-bar-balboa-peninsula | publisher = Daily Pilot | date = 17 March 2007 | accessdate = 16 July 2013 }}</ref>  In the winter months, Teller hauled the trailer to various county fairs.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3QQEAAAAMBAJ&pg \"How and Teller\"] Orange Coast Magazine, Sharon Tetrault, February 2003</ref>  When Phillips died a few years later, Teller bought the business and used it to expand to other locations.<ref name=\"balboa\" />  Frozen bananas are a tradition on [[Balboa Island]] to this day. Bob Fitch created the Frozen Banana in the 1950s on Balboa island maybe earlier. He purchased the spot where the Sugar and Spice sits today from Don Philips, renamed it the  Sugar and Spice. Bob Fitch sold the building around 1978-1979 to Mrs. Banto for $110,000.00.\n\n==Cultural references==\n\nIn the Fox television series ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', set in Orange County, the Bluth Company owns and runs a frozen banana stand.<ref>{{Cite web  | last = Miller | first = Michael | title = Going bananas for a stand | url = http://www.dailypilot.com/news/tn-dpt-me-0517-arrested-development-banana-stand-20130516,0,3063952.story | publisher = Daily Pilot | date = 16 May 2013 | accessdate = 16 July 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of regional dishes of the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.chiquitabananas.com/Banana-Recipes/Chocolate-Banana-Pop-recipe.aspx Frozen Banana Recipe - Chiquita]\n*[http://www.wikihow.com/Freeze-a-Banana WikiHow - How to Freeze a Banana]\n*[http://www.eatthelove.com/2013/05/frozen-banana/ An Arrested Development inspired recipe for Frozen Bananas]\n\n{{Banana}}\n\n[[Category:Frozen desserts]]\n[[Category:Banana dishes]]\n", "name_user": "Blackpplarewhiteppl", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(this is a quality edit)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_banana"}
