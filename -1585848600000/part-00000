Chopin's understanding of the meaning of love and courtship, in particular, was altered and became more pessimistic. This attitude finds its expression in \"The Story of an Hour\" when Mrs. Mallard questions the meaning of love and ultimately rejects it as meaningless.<ref>Bender, Bert (1991). \"The Teeth of Desire: The Awakening and the Descent of Man\".

Berkove, a professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, notes that there has been \"virtual critical agreement\" that the story is about female liberation from a repressive marriage. However, he contests this reading and argues that there is a \"deeper level of irony in the story\". The story, according to Berkove, depicts Mrs. Mallard as an \"immature egotist\" and a \"victim of her own extreme self-assertion\". He also challenges the notion that Chopin intended for the views of the story's main character to coincide with those of the author.<ref name=\":1\">Berkove, Lawrence L.

EBSCOhost.</ref> Selina Jamil argues that Chopin portrays Mrs. Mallard's perception of her husband's supposed death as fostered by emotions, rather than by rationality. Jamil claims that up until that point, Mrs. Mallard's life has been devoid of emotion to such an extent that she has even wondered if it is worth living. The repression of emotion may represent Mrs. Mallard's repressive husband, who had, up until that point, \"smothered\" and \"silenced\" her will. Therefore, her newfound freedom is brought on by an influx of emotion (representing the death of her repressive husband) that adds meaning and value to her life. Although Mrs. Mallard initially feels fear when she hears of her husband's death, the strength of the emotion is so powerful that Mrs. Mallard actually feels joy (because she is feeling). Since this \"joy that kills\" ultimately leads to Mrs. Mallard's death, one possible interpretation is that the repression of Mrs. Mallard's feelings is what killed her in the end.\n\nIn the same article, Jamil shows the repression that Mrs. Mallard faces as a wife. She realizes after her husband's apparent death that she is \"free, free, free\". This shows how her life would change and that she is now a new person and removed from the repressed life she faced before. No evidence is given in the story about how she is repressed, but her reaction to his death and her newfound confidence and freedom are enough. This repression of herself, that she dealt with, has now been removed with the death of her husband, enabling her to be free.\n\nIn a 2013 article, Jeremy Foote argues that \"The Story of an Hour\" can be read as a commentary and warning about technology\u2014specifically the railroad and the telegraph. The railroad, he claims, may be the cause of the distance between the Mallards (and many other couples of the time). It allowed for work and home to be very distant from each other, and eliminated opportunities for spouses to spend time together. Foote argues that the reason that Louise Mallard wanted more autonomy was because she and her husband did not spend time together. The alone time that Louise had in the house made her less close to her husband, and made her want her independence.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=Speed That Kills: The Role of Technology in Kate Chopin's THE STORY OF AN HOUR|journal=The Explicator|volume=71|issue=2|pages=85\u201389|doi=10.1080/00144940.2013.779222|last1=Foote|first1=J.}}</ref>\n\nThe way the telegraph is used in the story can be viewed as a warning about a world in which information (and people) are moving too quickly. Instead of having enough time to think about and process the death of her husband, it is thrust upon Mrs. Mallard, in its entirety, followed within minutes by the shock of seeing him alive. As the title suggests, this is a story about the importance of time. It may not have been the events that happened so much as the speed at which they happened which is so devastating to Mrs. Mallard.\n\n==Characters==\nLouise Mallard - The wife of Brently Mallard.

{"title_page": "Geochronology", "text_new": "{{short description|Science of determining the age of rocks, sediments and fossils}}\n[[Image:Geological time spiral.png|thumb|right|300px|An artistic depiction of the major events in the history of Earth]]\n\n'''Geochronology''' is the [[science]] of [[Chronological dating|determining the age]] of [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[fossil]]s, and [[sediment]]s using signatures inherent in the rocks themselves. Absolute geochronology can be accomplished through [[radioactive isotopes]], whereas relative geochronology is provided by tools such as [[palaeomagnetism]] and [[stable isotope ratio]]s. By combining multiple geochronological (and [[biostratigraphic]]) indicators the precision of the recovered age can be improved.\n\nGeochronology is different in application from biostratigraphy, which is the science of assigning sedimentary rocks to a known geological period via describing, cataloging and comparing fossil floral and faunal assemblages. Biostratigraphy does not ''directly'' provide an absolute age determination of a rock, but merely places it within an ''interval'' of time at which that fossil assemblage is known to have coexisted. Both disciplines work together hand in hand, however, to the point where they share the same system of naming [[strata]] (rock layers) and the time spans utilized to classify sublayers within a stratum.\n\nThe science of geochronology is the prime tool used in the discipline of [[chronostratigraphy]], which attempts to derive absolute age dates for all fossil assemblages and determine the geologic [[history of the Earth]] and [[List of Solar System objects by size|extraterrestrial bodies]].\n\n== Dating methods ==\n{{Geology to Paleobiology}}\n\n=== Radiometric dating ===\n{{main|Radiometric dating}}\nBy measuring the amount of [[radioactive decay]] of a [[radioactive isotope]] with a known [[half-life]], geologists can establish the absolute age of the parent material. A number of radioactive isotopes are used for this purpose, and depending on the rate of decay, are used for dating different geological periods. More slowly decaying isotopes are useful for longer periods of time, but less accurate in absolute years. With the exception of the [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon method]], most of these techniques are actually based on measuring an increase in the abundance of a [[radiogenic]] isotope, which is the decay-product of the radioactive parent isotope.<ref>Dickin, A.

Absolute geochronology can be accomplished through [[radioactive isotopes]], whereas relative geochronology is provided by tools such as [[palaeomagnetism]] and [[stable isotope ratio]]s. By combining multiple geochronological (and [[biostratigraphic]]) indicators the precision of the recovered age can be improved.\n\nGeochronology is different in application from biostratigraphy, which is the science of assigning sedimentary rocks to a known geological period via describing, cataloging and comparing fossil floral and faunal assemblages. Biostratigraphy does not ''directly'' provide an absolute age determination of a rock, but merely places it within an ''interval'' of time at which that fossil assemblage is known to have coexisted. Both disciplines work together hand in hand, however, to the point where they share the same system of naming [[strata]] (rock layers) and the time spans utilized to classify sublayers within a stratum.\n\nThe science of geochronology is the prime tool used in the discipline of [[chronostratigraphy]], which attempts to derive absolute age dates for all fossil assemblages and determine the geologic [[history of the Earth]] and [[List of Solar System objects by size|extraterrestrial bodies]].\n\n== Dating methods ==\n{{Geology to Paleobiology}}\n\n=== Radiometric dating ===\n{{main|Radiometric dating}}\nBy measuring the amount of [[radioactive decay]] of a [[radioactive isotope]] with a known [[half-life]], geologists can establish the absolute age of the parent material. A number of radioactive isotopes are used for this purpose, and depending on the rate of decay, are used for dating different geological periods. More slowly decaying isotopes are useful for longer periods of time, but less accurate in absolute years. With the exception of the [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon method]], most of these techniques are actually based on measuring an increase in the abundance of a [[radiogenic]] isotope, which is the decay-product of the radioactive parent isotope.<ref>Dickin, A.

He participated in various battles and campaigns throughout the [[Pacific War]] and was eventually shot down and killed over [[Leyte]], [[Philippines]] on 24 November 1944.\n\n==Early career==\nAyao Shirane enrolled in the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy]] in April 1933 and graduated from 64th class in March 1937. He completed an aerial training program and became a fighter pilot in March 1939. He was assigned to 12th Air Group in [[Central China]] in September and on 19 August 1940 participated [[Bombing of Chongqing]]. It was the first time the new [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighters were used in a combat mission, however no aerial opposition was encountered on that day. On September 13, he was one of the 13 A6M Zeros that were led to [[Hankow]] by Sabur\u014d Shindo, where in the aerial battle IJN pilots managed to claim 27 enemy fighters shot down without suffering any losses. Even though this was [[Lieutenant Junior Grade|Lieutenant (jg)]] Shirane's first aerial combat, he managed to shot down one of the enemy fighters. He was promoted to full [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] in May 1941.\n\n==Pacific War==\nAt the start of Pacific War, Lieutenant Shirane was transferred to carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']] and participated in several early battles, including [[Attack on Darwin]] and [[Indian Ocean Raid]]. He was eventually appointed flight division leader ([[buntaich\u014d]]) of ''Akagi'''s fighter squadron. He participated in [[Battle of Midway]] and on 4 June 1942 led a Combat Air Patrol (CAP) that engaged [[United States Navy]] (USN) torpedo bombers. Nevertheless, his carrier was attacked and sank by [[Douglas SBD Dauntless]] dive bombers.\n\nIn July 1942, Lieutenant Shirane was transferred to carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|''Zuikaku'']] and became its fighter squadron leader. In late October 1942, he participated in the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]. He led nine A6M Zeros that escorted the second wave strike on USN carriers, consisting of 27 [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers under the command of Lieutenant [[Sadamu Takahashi]] (''Zuikaku'' dive bomber squadron leader and [[hik\u014dtaich\u014d]]). They however could not locate the enemy carriers since Takahashi failed to receive the report on updated position of USN fleet. Nevertheless, carrier ''[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]'' was badly damaged by the first wave strike commanded by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Mamoru Seki]], which included his academy classmate Lieutenant [[Keiichi Arima]] who led one of the dive bomber divisions.\n\nIn late October 1942, Lieutenant Shirane participated in the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]]. He led eight A6M Zero fighters to escort the first strike wave on USN carriers, which consisted of 21 Aichi D3A dive bombers and 20 [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bombers and was under the command of Lieutenant Commander [[Shigeharu Murata]]. His fighter group was involved in intense aerial combat over the USN fleet, where they shot down several [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] fighters and in return lost several of their own Zeros. After USN strikes damaged carriers [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|''Sh\u014dkaku'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuih\u014d|''Zuih\u014d'']], remaining ''Zuikaku'' and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Jun'y\u014d|''Jun'y\u014d'']] launched follow-up strikes against USN carriers. Shirane again led Zeros to escort the bombers.\n\nOn 1 November 1943, Shirane was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and was transferred to 341st Air Group, which operated the new [[Kawanishi N1K]] fighters. On 24 November, he was shot down and killed over [[Leyte]], [[Philippines]] while he was engaged in a combat with [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] fighters.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n; Sources\n*{{cite book |last       = Hata\n |first      = Ikuhiko\n |author2    = Yasuho Izawa\n |author3    = Christopher Shores\n |year       = 2011\n |title      = Japanese Naval Air Force Fighter Units and their aces, 1932-1945.\n |publisher  = Grub Street\n |location   = London, UK\n |isbn       = 9781906502843\n}}\n* {{cite book \n |last=Lundstrom \n |first=John B. \n |year=2005 \n |edition=New \n |chapter= \n |title=First Team and the Guadalcanal Campaign: Naval Fighter Combat from August to November 1942\n |publisher=Naval Institute Press \n |location=Annapolis, Maryland \n |isbn=1-59114-472-8\n}}\n* {{cite book\n |last=Lundstrom\n |first=John B. \n |year=2005 |edition=New \n |chapter= \n |title=The First Team: Pacific Naval Air Combat from Pearl Harbor to Midway \n |publisher=Naval Institute Press \n |location=Annapolis, Maryland \n |isbn=1-59114-471-X\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shirane, Ayao}}\n[[Category:1916 births]]\n[[Category:Japanese naval aviators]]\n[[Category:Japanese World War II flying aces]]\n[[Category:Imperial Japanese Navy officers]]\n[[Category:1944 deaths]]\n[[Category:Imperial Japanese Naval Academy alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military person\n|name= Ayao Shirane\n|birth_date=1916\n|death_date={{death date|df=y|1944|11|24}}\n|birth_place= [[Tokyo]], [[Empire of Japan]]\n|death_place= [[Leyte]], [[Philippines]]\n|image=Ayao Shirane.jpg\n|nickname= \n|allegiance= [[Empire of Japan]]\n|branch= [[File:Naval Ensign of Japan.svg|22x20px|border]] [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] ([[Imperial Japanese Navy|IJN]])\n|serviceyears=\n|rank= [[Commander]]\n|commands=\n|unit= 12st Air Group<br/>[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']]<br/>[[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|''Zuikaku'']]\n|battles='''[[World War II]]:'''<br/>[[Second Sino-Japanese War]]<br/>[[Attack on Darwin]]<br/>[[Indian Ocean Raid]]<br/>[[Battle of Midway]]<br/>[[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]]<br/>[[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]]<br/>[[Solomon Islands Campaign]]\n|awards= \n|laterwork=\n}}\n{{Japanese name|Shirane}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''Ayao Shirane'''|\u767d\u6839 \u6590\u592b|Shirane Ayao}} was a [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] pilot [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during [[World War II]].

The line-up stabilised in 1971 after [[Steve Hackett]] replaced Phillips and [[Phil Collins]] joined as a drummer.

It is a sequel to 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', the seventh mainline installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and the twelfth entry in the franchise overall. The film is written and directed by [[Simon Kinberg]] (in his feature directorial debut) and stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring <!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->[[James McAvoy]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Sophie Turner]], [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Alexandra Shipp]], and [[Jessica Chastain]]<!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->. In ''Dark Phoenix'', the X-Men are forced to face the full power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] after a mission in space goes wrong.\n\nAfter ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) erased the events of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) from the [[X-Men (film series)|series']] timeline, Kinberg expressed interest in a new adaptation of [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s \"[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]\" in a future film that would be more faithful than his previous attempt with ''The Last Stand'', which was not well received, and even he and writer [[Zak Penn]] were equally unhappy with how it turned out. The new adaptation was confirmed as a follow-up to ''Apocalypse'' in 2016. Kinberg signed on to make his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] in June 2017, when the majority of the cast was set to return from ''Apocalypse''. Filming began later that month in [[Montreal]] and was completed in October 2017; the entire third act was later reshot in late 2018, following poor test screenings. The film was dedicated to the memory of ''X-Men'' co-creator [[Stan Lee]], who died in 2018.\n\n''Dark Phoenix'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 7, 2019, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It grossed $252{{nbsp}}million worldwide on a $200-million budget and became the lowest-grossing installment in the series. It also received generally unfavorable reviews from critics with various critical takes; many viewed it as a disappointing and anticlimactic conclusion to Fox's ''X-Men'' series although the performances of the cast and [[Hans Zimmer]]'s score were praised.<ref name=\"Reviews1\" /><ref name=\"Reviews2\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, eight-year-old [[Jean Grey]] and her parents get into a car accident that kills her mother. Shortly afterward, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] takes her to [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] because her father was afraid of her.\n\nIn 1992, the [[X-Men]] respond to a distress signal from the [[Space Shuttle|space shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], which is critically damaged by solar flare-like energy during the [[STS-49]] mission. While they save the astronauts, Jean is stranded and struck by the energy which she absorbs into her body to save her team's aircraft from destruction. She survives the event, and her psychic powers are greatly amplified as a result, but they become uncontrollable, and she accidentally unleashes her power on mutants celebrating the victory at Xavier's school. Xavier had placed mental walls in Jean's mind as a girl to protect her psychic mind from experiencing trauma; these are destroyed by Jean's enhanced power, and the trauma slowly returns, resulting in her being full of rage and pain. She travels to her childhood hometown after finding out that her father is still alive and learns that he abandoned her. Jean recovers her complete memory of the car accident and remembers that she had inadvertently caused it rendering her mother unconscious at the wheel with her telepathy, which causes her to develop [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. The X-Men arrive and attempt to take Jean home, but she uses her power against [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkholme]], injuring the former and killing the latter, before fleeing.\n\nJean travels to the mutant refugee island of [[Genosha]] to seek assistance from [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]] in controlling her rage but is turned away by him after she engages in combat with U.S. military forces tasked with her arrest. Jean meets Vuk, the leader of a shape-shifting alien race known as the [[D'Bari]]. She explains to Jean that she has bonded with [[Phoenix Force (comics)|a force of cosmic power]] that wiped out the D'Bari home planet long ago. The power had consumed all those it came across until it was drawn to Jean. Meanwhile, [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], mad with grief by Raven's death, allies with Erik and the mutant refugees in an attempt to kill Jean in [[New York City]].\n\nUpon learning of Erik's plan, the X-Men try to stop him and [[Brotherhood of Mutants|his faction of mutants]]. As they battle, Erik manages to enter the building and confront Jean, only to fall to her amplified powers. Xavier then enters the building with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]]. Jean attacks them until Xavier convinces her to read his memories &ndash; allowing her personality to resurface. Feeling remorseful, Jean offers to let Vuk take the force from her; however, it is revealed that doing so would kill Jean, as well as revealing that Vuk also intends to use the force to conquer Earth. Xavier and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] are able to prevent Vuk from fully absorbing the force from Jean, though Jean loses consciousness from the ordeal. Troops sent by the U.S. government, who use stun weapons and power-inhibiting collars, attack and subdue both mutant factions, who are placed on a train headed towards a containment facility.\n\nOn the train, Xavier admits to Hank that the latter was right in his earlier accusations of violating Jean's mind. The train is attacked by Vuk and her D'Bari forces. When the soldiers are overpowered by the shape-shifters, the mutants are freed from their restraints to combat the threat. The mutants deal with most of the D'Bari attackers, but Vuk arrives and heads for Jean, defeating each mutant who attempts to stop her. Xavier confers with Jean within his mind, allowing Jean to gain control of her power. After forgiving Xavier, Jean saves the mutants from Vuk's attacks and the ensuing train wreck before proceeding to disintegrate the remaining D'Bari when they attack her. Vuk once again attempts to drain Jean of the force, but Jean takes Vuk into outer space, retakes the power that Vuk had received earlier, and then kills her. Jean then disappears in a burst of energy in the form of a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, Xavier's school is renamed the \"Jean Grey School for Gifted Youngsters\", and Hank becomes their new dean with Xavier having retired. While settling himself in [[Paris]], Xavier is reunited with Erik and agrees to play a game of chess with him. As they start playing, a flaming phoenix appears in the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Dark Phoenix cast.jpg|140|1150|The cast of ''Dark Phoenix'' promoting the film at the 2019 [[WonderCon]].

Many of the characters in the film turn against Xavier as some of his decisions regarding Jean Grey's abilities are revealed. Director [[Simon Kinberg]] felt that the character always acts out of concern for the \"greater good,\" though he may make some \"misguided\" choices at times. Kinberg hoped that each character would come across as having \"a valid point of view\" in the film.<ref name=\"KinbergTurnerIGNSep2018\" />\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]]: <br />Quicksilver's father and a powerful mutant who can control [[magnetic field]]s and manipulate metal, he is Xavier's former best friend and often rival. Magneto has formed a community of mutant refugees on the island of [[Genosha]],<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> which Kinberg compared to [[Israel]] in it being a homeland where mutants can be safe.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven / Mystique]]: <br />A shape-shifting mutant and Xavier's adopted sister. Lawrence described her role in the film as more maternal than before, as she leads the younger X-Men.<ref name=\"EWLawrence\" /> The film continues growing the schism between Mystique and Xavier, with Mystique not approving of some of Xavier's methods, though Kinberg hoped that this would be more subtle in ''Dark Phoenix'' than in previous ''X-Men'' films. The film also sees the character change between appearing as Raven and Mystique more than previously, with each change having a specific meaning to the character and story.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> She continues to have feelings for Beast.\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy / Beast]]: <br />A mutant with a beastly appearance and superhuman physical abilities. He is a teacher at Xavier's School and helps lead the younger X-Men. He continues to have feelings for Mystique.\n* [[Sophie Turner]] as [[Jean Grey]] / [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]: <br />An extremely powerful mutant with telepathic and [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers who is one of Xavier's most prized students. The [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix entity]] is unleashed in the film, leading to a fight between the two personalities for control. Turner studied [[dissociative identity disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]] for the role, particularly for scenes where she has to change from the vulnerable Jean to the confident Phoenix.<ref name=\"EWTurner\" /> Kinberg said Turner has the lead role in the film, a first for the actress.<ref name=\"ChastainTHR\" /> Summer Fontana portrays a young Jean Grey.\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers / Cyclops]]: <br />A mutant who fires concussive optic beams. The film develops his relationship with Jean Grey, which Kinberg called \"a huge part of the emotional core of the movie.\" This forces the character to become a leader in the film,<ref name=\"JeanScott\" /> as he is the most prominent character who holds on to hope as Jean grows more unstable.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n* [[Alexandra Shipp]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe / Storm]]: <br />An African mutant who can control the weather.\n* [[Evan Peters]] as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff / Quicksilver]]: <br />Magneto's mutant son who can move at [[Speedster (fiction)|superhuman speed]]. Peters described the character as more mature and subdued in the film, being focused on using his abilities for good as a member of the X-Men.<ref name=\"PetersSRMay2018\" />\n* [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]] as [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler]]: <br />A German mutant who can teleport.\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Vuk:<br />The leader of a shape-shifting alien race known as the [[D'Bari]] who manipulates the Phoenix. Kinberg described her as \"the devil on Jean's shoulder,\"<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> while Chastain called her character \"clinical.\"<ref name=\"EWChastain\" /> Chastain also plays Margaret Smith, the woman Vuk impersonates.\n* [[Scott Shepherd (actor)|Scott Shepherd]] as John Grey\n* [[Ato Essandoh]] as Jones, Vuk's second in command.\n* [[Brian d'Arcy James]] as the [[President of the United States]]\n* [[Halston Sage]] as [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]] in the character's first cinematic appearance.<ref name=\"40Years\" />\n* [[Lamar Johnson (actor)|Lamar Johnson]] as [[Match (Marvel Comics)|Match]]\n\nAdditionally, Kota Eberhardt portrays telepath [[Selene (comics)|Selene Gallio]], while [[Andrew Stehlin]] portrays Ariki, a mutant who can utilize his hair braids as a weapon.

The studio chose to adapt the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" as only one of the film's \"parallel storylines\", with an executive at [[20th Century Fox]] suggesting that the \"[[Gifted (comics)|Gifted]]\" storyline also be in that film.<ref name=\"KinbergX3\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicmix.com/news/2008/04/15/interview-zak-penn-on-the-grand-x-men-fans-and-co-writing-hulk/ |title=INTERVIEW: ZAK PENN ON THE GRAND, X-MEN FANS AND CO-WRITING HULK |access-date=March 18, 2014}}</ref> This version of the story was not well received by fans and critics. Kinberg stated that he and Penn were ultimately unhappy with how the adaptation turned out as well.<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" />\n\nAfter the timeline of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' franchise]] was [[retconned]] with the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', it was noted that a new adaptation of the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" could be made that ignores the events of ''The Last Stand''. Kinberg and Singer both expressed interest in the prospect, and hinted that 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' would set up elements for a retelling. ''Apocalypse'' introduces [[Sophie Turner]] as a young Jean Grey, and begins exploring \"how powerful she is.\"<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" /> By April 2016, the sequel to ''Apocalypse'' was believed to indeed re-adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga.\"<ref name=\"HHApr2016\" /> In May 2016, Kinberg said that the next ''X-Men'' film after ''Apocalypse'' would be set in the 1990s, advancing one decade, as had been done for each of the previous few ''X-Men'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergMay2016\" /> He also noted that ''Apocalypse'' had introduced younger versions of several characters from the original ''X-Men'' films to give them a new [[origin story]]\u2014including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and Jean Grey\u2014with the intention of then exploring them in their own line of films. He added that he also hoped to see the cast of the previous trilogy of films return, namely [[James McAvoy]] as [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], [[Michael Fassbender]] as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto, and [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkh\u00f6lme / Mystique]].<ref name=\"CastHopes\" />\n\nIn July, Kinberg said he would begin writing the next mainline ''X-Men'' film \"real soon\".<ref name=\"KinbergJul2016\" /> That November, Fox was said to be pressing \"the reset button\" on the franchise due to the financial and critical under-performance of ''Apocalypse'', with the franchise being reconfigured and Singer not returning to direct the next film. McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, and [[Nicholas Hoult]]'s contracts from the previous trilogy had ended, but Kinberg was optimistically writing the new script with them in mind.<ref name=\"UniversePlans\" /> It was rumored in February 2017 that the next film would be titled ''X-Men: Supernova'', and would begin filming that June.<ref name=\"Supernova\" /> Also in February, Turner confirmed that she would return for the film.<ref name=\"TurnerFeb2017\" /> Kinberg was believed to be interested in making his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] with the film,<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb2017\" /> and was described as the top contender for the job with interest from Fox. The studio was also looking to negotiate new deals with Lawrence, Fassbender, McAvoy, and Hoult to return.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20172\" /> By the end of the month, Kinberg described reports that he may direct the film as \"premature,\" but added that if he were to direct, he would not be daunted by the scale of the film due to his experience writing and producing many of the other ''X-Men'' films. He also reiterated that he would adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\" differently to how it was for ''The Last Stand'' if given another opportunity to do so.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20173\" />\n\n===Writing and original two-part plan===\n\nSimon Kinberg wanted a two-film story, as hinted by Olivia Munn in an interview with Collider in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/olivia-munn-interview-lego-ninjago-movie-x-men-dark-phoenix/|title=Olivia Munn on 'The LEGO Ninjago Movie' & Returning for 'X-Men: Dark Phoenix'|first=Christina|last=Radish|date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' later confirmed this initial approach.

At that time, Chastain was in talks to join the cast as Shi'ar Empress [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]], the film's villain.

The final costumes for the film feature the yellow-and-blue design of the original comics, but combine features of designs from many different incarnations of the group. Kinberg also looked to ''Logan'' for general design inspiration, wanting to replicate the \"naturalistic\" and \"handmade\" quality of that film for the costumes, sets, props, and title design. He felt that this would give more impact to the large-scale elements of the film, and help it be more emotional, comparing this idea to the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on June 28, 2017, in [[Montreal]], Quebec,<ref name=\"FormalizedPlans\" /><ref name=\"ACTRAFilming\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Teen Spirit''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> [[Mauro Fiore]] served as cinematographer.<ref name=\"Fiore\" /> Filming primarily took place at MELS Studios.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> Before the end of the month, [[Evan Peters]] was set to reprise his role as \"audience favorite\" character [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] from the previous films, and [[Lamar Johnson (actor)|Lamar Johnson]] joined the cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"PetersJohnson\" /> At the start of August, Chastain confirmed her involvement in the film;<ref name=\"ChastainConfirmed\" /> she was interested in the story, after turning down roles in other superhero films, due to its focus on female characters.<ref name=\"XWomen\" /> Kinberg said he wanted the film to be \"human\" and emotional like previous ''X-Men'' films, and that he was looking to ground the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" story for his adaptation \"so it's not too intergalactic.\"<ref name=\"KinbergTFAug2017\" /> He later clarified that the film would still include alien characters as in the comic storyline, an element that was ignored for the ''Last Stand'' adaptation but which he felt was integral to the story.<ref name=\"KinbergETMay2018\" /><ref name=\"KinbergTurnerIGNSep2018\" /> He also said that the film would tonally be less operatic than previous ''X-Men'' films, which he hoped would make it more relatable for audiences.<ref name=\"KinbergETMay2018\" /> By September, [[Daniel Cudmore]] had stated that he would be appearing in the film, but could not confirm whether he would be reprising his role as [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] from previous films in the franchise.<ref name=\"CudmoreSep2017\" /> Chastain revealed that she was not actually playing Lilandra.<ref name=\"NoLilandra\" /> While [[Olivia Munn]] had initially said that she would reprise her role as [[Psylocke]]<!-- , and described ''Dark Phoenix'' as \"a two parter\" -->,<ref name=\"Munn\" /> by February 2019, she revealed that she was unable to reprise her role due to scheduling conflicts with filming ''[[The Predator (film)|The Predator]]''.<ref name=\"NoPsylocke\" /> Filming was completed on October 14, 2017.<ref name=\"ACTRAFilming\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nIn December 2017, Kinberg revealed that the film would be in post-production for almost a year, longer than usual for the series, because he wanted to take the time to have the visual effects look right by focusing on the \"nuance\" of the effects rather than the scale.<ref name=\"EWVisuals\" /> He also explained that he \"felt in his gut\" that this was the story that he needed to tell once Singer left the franchise, and that his vision for the film was \"so clear in my head, emotionally and visually, that it would have killed me to hand this to somebody else to direct.\" The film was described as being the most sinister and somber of the franchise, with McAvoy finding it to be the most emotional of the ''X-Men'' films he had worked on. It becomes a \"fight for Jean's soul\" and features a twist that was intended to have significant repercussions on the entire franchise.<ref name=\"EWCover\" /> Lawrence revealed that she had worked to convince Kinberg to direct the film, and had promised to return for it if he did so, despite her dislike of the make-up required to portray her character.<ref name=\"EWLawrence2\" /> It was also revealed then that the film would introduce a version of the island [[Genosha]], adapted to the film as a mutant refuge led by Magneto;<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> and that it would focus on the female characters more so than previous films in the series, particularly Jean Grey as both the protagonist and antagonist of the film, and Chastain's character, with whom Grey has a complex relationship.<ref name=\"XWomen\" />\n\nFox delayed the film's release in March 2018, pushing it back from November 2, 2018 to February 14, 2019.<ref name=\"Mar2018ReleaseDelay\" /> This was because Fox and Kinberg wanted to schedule some routine reshoots for the film after receiving feedback from audiences during a test screening, but were not able to get all of the necessary cast members together until August or September 2018. This would not have left enough time to complete post-production work such as visual effects for the additional footage before the November 2018 release date.<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /> Specifically, Kinberg was looking to rework the third act of the film, and re-wrote part of the script ahead of the reshoots. With post-production already underway, the film was believed to have been under-budget, while the planned reshoots would cost less than $10{{nbsp}}million. Additionally, Kinberg and the studio had been looking to change the film's release date for \"some time\" to avoid competing with the Christmas-oriented film ''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''. The new February release date was noted as having the film opening away from other major studio films, while placing it on [[President's Day]] weekend, which had proved to be successful for ''Deadpool'' and Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''.<ref name=\"THRReshoots\" /> Addressing the reshoots, Kinberg confirmed the scheduling delays, and described the photography as a \"normal\" part of the film's creation that would allow him \"enough time to have it ready and looking perfect.\"<ref name=\"KinbergReshoots\" />\n\nAt the end of April, a Fox panel at the 2018 CinemaCon revealed the first logo for the film. It did not include \"''X-Men''\" in the title, but included a circle around the 'X' in ''Dark Phoenix'' which was compared to the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' logo;<ref name=\"FirstLogo\" /> the film was later confirmed to be simply titled ''Dark Phoenix'' in the United States, and ''X-Men: Dark Phoenix'' for release internationally.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> By that August, the reshoots were expected to take place in Montreal over two-and-a-half weeks, though the Quebec Film and Television Bureau believed that these reshoots would take up to three months to complete, due to scheduling conflicts among the cast members.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /><ref name=\"ColliderReshootsAug2018\" /> The reshoots were set to take place at MTL Grand\u00e9 studios since MELS Studios was reserved for another production during the reshoot period,<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> and had begun by August 31.<ref name=\"ReshootsBegin\" /> At the end of September, after the release of the film's first trailer, Fox again delayed the film's release, setting it for June 7, 2019. This date was seen as a better time to release the film in China, where the trailer received more attention than in the United States, while also allowing it to take advantage of premium screens that had previously been reserved for Fox's newly-delayed and later canceled ''[[Gambit (unproduced film)|Gambit]]'' film.<ref name=\"Sep2018ReleaseDelay\" /><ref name=\"DisneyMay2019ScheduleUpdate\">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/gambit-movie-dead/ |title=\u2018Gambit\u2019 Is Dead; Disney Drops the X-Men Spinoff from the Schedule |website=[[Collider]] |last=Goldberg |first=Matt |date=May 7, 2019 |accessdate=May 7, 2019 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/78CX9lkfJ |archive-date=May 7, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The move was also reportedly to appease [[James Cameron]], who had ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' moved from December to February and did not want competition from another Fox would-be blockbuster; Kinberg and ''Dark Phoenix'' producers opposed the change as the film was not made for a summer and was facing heavy competition.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"We Were Wrong\": Behind Fox's ''Dark Phoenix'' Debacle |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=June 10, 2019 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/we-were-wrong-behind-dark-phoenix-foxs-dismal-x-men-franchise-finale-plans-1216859 |access-date=June 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, [[Lana Condor]] revealed that she was unable to return as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] due to her commitment to the film ''[[To All the Boys I've Loved Before (film)|To All the Boys I've Loved Before]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"CondorCollider\" /> [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]] serves as editor for the film.<ref name=\"EditorSmith\" /> Visual effects were provided by [[Moving Picture Company|MPC]], MELS, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Rodeo FX]], [[Scanline VFX]] and Soho VFX, with Phil Brennan serving as the main visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"VisualEffects\" />\n\n==Music==\nEvan Peters stated in January 2018 that [[Hans Zimmer]] was composing the score for the film,<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /> despite Zimmer having said in March 2016 that he would not score another superhero film following his experience working on ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.<ref name=\"ZimmerNoSupers\" /> Zimmer later explained that in conversations with director [[Ron Howard]] he was convinced to not keep a \"blanket\" view, and to focus on waiting for the right story rather than avoiding an entire genre.

and later released on home media as '''''X-Men: Dark Phoenix''''') is a 2019 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[X-Men]] characters. It is a sequel to 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', the seventh mainline installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and the twelfth entry in the franchise overall. The film is written and directed by [[Simon Kinberg]] (in his feature directorial debut) and stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring <!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->[[James McAvoy]], [[Michael Fassbender]], [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Sophie Turner]], [[Tye Sheridan]], [[Alexandra Shipp]], and [[Jessica Chastain]]<!-- CAST ORDER PER POSTER BILLING BLOCK -->. In ''Dark Phoenix'', the X-Men are forced to face the full power of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] after a mission in space goes wrong.\n\nAfter ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) erased the events of ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006) from the [[X-Men (film series)|series']] timeline, Kinberg expressed interest in a new adaptation of [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s \"[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]\" in a future film that would be more faithful than his previous attempt with ''The Last Stand'', which was not well received even he & writer [[Zak Penn]] were equally unhappy with how it turned out. The new adaptation was confirmed as a follow-up to ''Apocalypse'' in 2016. Kinberg signed on to make his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] in June 2017, when the majority of the cast was set to return from ''Apocalypse''. Filming began later that month in [[Montreal]] and was completed in October 2017; the entire third act was later reshot in late 2018, following poor test screenings. The film was dedicated to the memory of ''X-Men'' co-creator [[Stan Lee]], who died in 2018.\n\n''Dark Phoenix'' was theatrically released in the United States on June 7, 2019, by [[20th Century Fox]]. It grossed $252{{nbsp}}million worldwide on a $200-million budget and became the lowest-grossing installment in the series. It also received generally unfavorable reviews from critics with various critical takes; many viewed it as a disappointing and anticlimactic conclusion to Fox's ''X-Men'' series although the performances of the cast and [[Hans Zimmer]]'s score were praised.<ref name=\"Reviews1\" /><ref name=\"Reviews2\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1975, eight-year-old [[Jean Grey]] and her parents get into a car accident that kills her mother. Shortly afterward, [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] takes her to [[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]] because her father was afraid of her.\n\nIn 1992, the [[X-Men]] respond to a distress signal from the [[Space Shuttle|space shuttle]] [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], which is critically damaged by solar flare-like energy during the [[STS-49]] mission. While they save the astronauts, Jean is stranded and struck by the energy which she absorbs into her body to save her team's aircraft from destruction. She survives the event, and her psychic powers are greatly amplified as a result, but they become uncontrollable, and she accidentally unleashes her power on mutants celebrating the victory at Xavier's school. Xavier had placed mental walls in Jean's mind as a girl to protect her psychic mind from experiencing trauma; these are destroyed by Jean's enhanced power, and the trauma slowly returns, resulting in her being full of rage and pain. She travels to her childhood hometown after finding out that her father is still alive and learns that he abandoned her. Jean recovers her complete memory of the car accident and remembers that she had inadvertently caused it rendering her mother unconscious at the wheel with her telepathy, which causes her to develop [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]]. The X-Men arrive and attempt to take Jean home, but she uses her power against [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkholme]], injuring the former and killing the latter, before fleeing.\n\nJean travels to the mutant refugee island of [[Genosha]] to seek assistance from [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]] in controlling her rage but is turned away by him after she engages in combat with U.S. military forces tasked with her arrest. Jean meets Vuk, the leader of a shape-shifting alien race known as the [[D'Bari]]. She explains to Jean that she has bonded with [[Phoenix Force (comics)|a force of cosmic power]] that wiped out the D'Bari home planet long ago. The power had consumed all those it came across until it was drawn to Jean. Meanwhile, [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]], mad with grief by Raven's death, allies with Erik and the mutant refugees in an attempt to kill Jean in [[New York City]].\n\nUpon learning of Erik's plan, the X-Men try to stop him and [[Brotherhood of Mutants|his faction of mutants]]. As they battle, Erik manages to enter the building and confront Jean, only to fall to her amplified powers. Xavier then enters the building with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Kurt Wagner]]. Jean attacks them until Xavier convinces her to read his memories &ndash; allowing her personality to resurface. Feeling remorseful, Jean offers to let Vuk take the force from her; however, it is revealed that doing so would kill Jean, as well as revealing that Vuk also intends to use the force to conquer Earth. Xavier and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] are able to prevent Vuk from fully absorbing the force from Jean, though Jean loses consciousness from the ordeal. Troops sent by the U.S. government, who use stun weapons and power-inhibiting collars, attack and subdue both mutant factions, who are placed on a train headed towards a containment facility.\n\nOn the train, Xavier admits to Hank that the latter was right in his earlier accusations of violating Jean's mind. The train is attacked by Vuk and her D'Bari forces. When the soldiers are overpowered by the shape-shifters, the mutants are freed from their restraints to combat the threat. The mutants deal with most of the D'Bari attackers, but Vuk arrives and heads for Jean, defeating each mutant who attempts to stop her. Xavier confers with Jean within his mind, allowing Jean to gain control of her power. After forgiving Xavier, Jean saves the mutants from Vuk's attacks and the ensuing train wreck before proceeding to disintegrate the remaining D'Bari when they attack her. Vuk once again attempts to drain Jean of the force, but Jean takes Vuk into outer space, retakes the power that Vuk had received earlier, and then kills her. Jean then disappears in a burst of energy in the form of a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, Xavier's school is renamed the \"Jean Grey School for Gifted Youngsters\", and Hank becomes their new dean with Xavier having retired. While settling himself in [[Paris]], Xavier is reunited with Erik and agrees to play a game of chess with him. As they start playing, a flaming phoenix appears in the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Tall image|Dark Phoenix cast.jpg|140|1150|The cast of ''Dark Phoenix'' promoting the film at the 2019 [[WonderCon]].

Many of the characters in the film turn against Xavier as some of his decisions regarding Jean Grey's abilities are revealed. Director [[Simon Kinberg]] felt that the character always acts out of concern for the \"greater good,\" though he may make some \"misguided\" choices at times. Kinberg hoped that each character would come across as having \"a valid point of view\" in the film.<ref name=\"KinbergTurnerIGNSep2018\" />\n* [[Michael Fassbender]] as [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto]]: <br />Quicksilver's father and a powerful mutant who can control [[magnetic field]]s and manipulate metal, he is Xavier's former best friend and often rival.

Lawrence described her role in the film as more maternal than before, as she leads the younger X-Men.<ref name=\"EWLawrence\" /> The film continues growing the schism between Mystique and Xavier, with Mystique not approving of some of Xavier's methods, though Kinberg hoped that this would be more subtle in ''Dark Phoenix'' than in previous ''X-Men'' films.

The [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix entity]] is unleashed in the film, leading to a fight between the two personalities for control. Turner studied [[dissociative identity disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]] for the role, particularly for scenes where she has to change from the vulnerable Jean to the confident Phoenix.<ref name=\"EWTurner\" /> Kinberg said Turner has the lead role in the film, a first for the actress.<ref name=\"ChastainTHR\" /> Summer Fontana portrays a young Jean Grey.\n* [[Tye Sheridan]] as [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers / Cyclops]]: <br />A mutant who fires concussive optic beams. The film develops his relationship with Jean Grey, which Kinberg called \"a huge part of the emotional core of the movie.\" This forces the character to become a leader in the film,<ref name=\"JeanScott\" /> as he is the most prominent character who holds on to hope as Jean grows more unstable.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" />\n* [[Alexandra Shipp]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe / Storm]]: <br />An African mutant who can control the weather.\n* [[Evan Peters]] as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff / Quicksilver]]: <br />Magneto's mutant son who can move at [[Speedster (fiction)|superhuman speed]].

The studio chose to adapt the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" as only one of the film's \"parallel storylines\", with an executive at [[20th Century Fox]] suggesting that the \"[[Gifted (comics)|Gifted]]\" storyline also be in that film.<ref name=\"KinbergX3\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicmix.com/news/2008/04/15/interview-zak-penn-on-the-grand-x-men-fans-and-co-writing-hulk/ |title=INTERVIEW: ZAK PENN ON THE GRAND, X-MEN FANS AND CO-WRITING HULK |access-date=March 18, 2014}}</ref> This version of the story was not well received by fans and critics. Kinberg stated that he and Penn were ultimately unhappy with how the adaptation turned out as well.<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" />\n\nAfter the timeline of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' franchise]] was [[retconned]] with the 2014 film ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', it was noted that a new adaptation of the \"Dark Phoenix Saga\" could be made that ignores the events of ''The Last Stand''. Kinberg and Singer both expressed interest in the prospect, and hinted that 2016's ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' would set up elements for a retelling. ''Apocalypse'' introduces [[Sophie Turner]] as a young Jean Grey, and begins exploring \"how powerful she is.\"<ref name=\"RebootJan2016\" /> By April 2016, the sequel to ''Apocalypse'' was believed to indeed re-adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga.\"<ref name=\"HHApr2016\" /> In May 2016, Kinberg said that the next ''X-Men'' film after ''Apocalypse'' would be set in the 1990s, advancing one decade, as had been done for each of the previous few ''X-Men'' films.<ref name=\"KinbergMay2016\" /> He also noted that ''Apocalypse'' had introduced younger versions of several characters from the original ''X-Men'' films to give them a new [[origin story]]\u2014including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and Jean Grey\u2014with the intention of then exploring them in their own line of films. He added that he also hoped to see the cast of the previous trilogy of films return, namely [[James McAvoy]] as [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], [[Michael Fassbender]] as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto, and [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Mystique (comics)|Raven Darkh\u00f6lme / Mystique]].<ref name=\"CastHopes\" />\n\nIn July, Kinberg said he would begin writing the next mainline ''X-Men'' film \"real soon\".<ref name=\"KinbergJul2016\" /> That November, Fox was said to be pressing \"the reset button\" on the franchise due to the financial and critical under-performance of ''Apocalypse'', with the franchise being reconfigured and Singer not returning to direct the next film. McAvoy, Fassbender, Lawrence, and [[Nicholas Hoult]]'s contracts from the previous trilogy had ended, but Kinberg was optimistically writing the new script with them in mind.<ref name=\"UniversePlans\" /> It was rumored in February 2017 that the next film would be titled ''X-Men: Supernova'', and would begin filming that June.<ref name=\"Supernova\" /> Also in February, Turner confirmed that she would return for the film.<ref name=\"TurnerFeb2017\" /> Kinberg was believed to be interested in making his [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debut]] with the film,<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb2017\" /> and was described as the top contender for the job with interest from Fox. The studio was also looking to negotiate new deals with Lawrence, Fassbender, McAvoy, and Hoult to return.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20172\" /> By the end of the month, Kinberg described reports that he may direct the film as \"premature,\" but added that if he were to direct, he would not be daunted by the scale of the film due to his experience writing and producing many of the other ''X-Men'' films. He also reiterated that he would adapt \"The Dark Phoenix Saga\" differently to how it was for ''The Last Stand'' if given another opportunity to do so.<ref name=\"KinbergDirectFeb20173\" />\n\n===Writing and original two-part plan===\n\nSimon Kinberg wanted a two-film story, as hinted by Olivia Munn in an interview with Collider in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/olivia-munn-interview-lego-ninjago-movie-x-men-dark-phoenix/|title=Olivia Munn on 'The LEGO Ninjago Movie' & Returning for 'X-Men: Dark Phoenix'|first=Christina|last=Radish|date=September 26, 2017}}</ref> ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' later confirmed this initial approach.

The final costumes for the film feature the yellow-and-blue design of the original comics, but combine features of designs from many different incarnations of the group. Kinberg also looked to ''Logan'' for general design inspiration, wanting to replicate the \"naturalistic\" and \"handmade\" quality of that film for the costumes, sets, props, and title design.

It becomes a \"fight for Jean's soul\" and features a twist that was intended to have significant repercussions on the entire franchise.<ref name=\"EWCover\" /> Lawrence revealed that she had worked to convince Kinberg to direct the film, and had promised to return for it if he did so, despite her dislike of the make-up required to portray her character.<ref name=\"EWLawrence2\" /> It was also revealed then that the film would introduce a version of the island [[Genosha]], adapted to the film as a mutant refuge led by Magneto;<ref name=\"Genosha\" /> and that it would focus on the female characters more so than previous films in the series, particularly Jean Grey as both the protagonist and antagonist of the film, and Chastain's character, with whom Grey has a complex relationship.<ref name=\"XWomen\" />\n\nFox delayed the film's release in March 2018, pushing it back from November 2, 2018 to February 14, 2019.<ref name=\"Mar2018ReleaseDelay\" /> This was because Fox and Kinberg wanted to schedule some routine reshoots for the film after receiving feedback from audiences during a test screening, but were not able to get all of the necessary cast members together until August or September 2018. This would not have left enough time to complete post-production work such as visual effects for the additional footage before the November 2018 release date.<ref name=\"ColliderReshoots\" /> Specifically, Kinberg was looking to rework the third act of the film, and re-wrote part of the script ahead of the reshoots. With post-production already underway, the film was believed to have been under-budget, while the planned reshoots would cost less than $10{{nbsp}}million. Additionally, Kinberg and the studio had been looking to change the film's release date for \"some time\" to avoid competing with the Christmas-oriented film ''[[The Nutcracker and the Four Realms]]''. The new February release date was noted as having the film opening away from other major studio films, while placing it on [[President's Day]] weekend, which had proved to be successful for ''Deadpool'' and Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''.<ref name=\"THRReshoots\" /> Addressing the reshoots, Kinberg confirmed the scheduling delays, and described the photography as a \"normal\" part of the film's creation that would allow him \"enough time to have it ready and looking perfect.\"<ref name=\"KinbergReshoots\" />\n\nAt the end of April, a Fox panel at the 2018 CinemaCon revealed the first logo for the film. It did not include \"''X-Men''\" in the title, but included a circle around the 'X' in ''Dark Phoenix'' which was compared to the ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' logo;<ref name=\"FirstLogo\" /> the film was later confirmed to be simply titled ''Dark Phoenix'' in the United States, and ''X-Men: Dark Phoenix'' for release internationally.<ref name=\"KinbergEmpireBreakdown\" /> By that August, the reshoots were expected to take place in Montreal over two-and-a-half weeks, though the Quebec Film and Television Bureau believed that these reshoots would take up to three months to complete, due to scheduling conflicts among the cast members.<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /><ref name=\"ColliderReshootsAug2018\" /> The reshoots were set to take place at MTL Grand\u00e9 studios since MELS Studios was reserved for another production during the reshoot period,<ref name=\"LaPresseReshoots\" /> and had begun by August 31.<ref name=\"ReshootsBegin\" /> At the end of September, after the release of the film's first trailer, Fox again delayed the film's release, setting it for June 7, 2019. This date was seen as a better time to release the film in China, where the trailer received more attention than in the United States, while also allowing it to take advantage of premium screens that had previously been reserved for Fox's newly-delayed and later canceled ''[[Gambit (unproduced film)|Gambit]]'' film.<ref name=\"Sep2018ReleaseDelay\" /><ref name=\"DisneyMay2019ScheduleUpdate\">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/gambit-movie-dead/ |title=\u2018Gambit\u2019 Is Dead; Disney Drops the X-Men Spinoff from the Schedule |website=[[Collider]] |last=Goldberg |first=Matt |date=May 7, 2019 |accessdate=May 7, 2019 |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/78CX9lkfJ |archive-date=May 7, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The move was also reportedly to appease [[James Cameron]], who had ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' moved from December to February and did not want competition from another Fox would-be blockbuster; Kinberg and ''Dark Phoenix'' producers opposed the change as the film was not made for a summer and was facing heavy competition.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"We Were Wrong\": Behind Fox's ''Dark Phoenix'' Debacle |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first=Borys |last=Kit |date=June 10, 2019 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/we-were-wrong-behind-dark-phoenix-foxs-dismal-x-men-franchise-finale-plans-1216859 |access-date=June 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2019, [[Lana Condor]] revealed that she was unable to return as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] due to her commitment to the film ''[[To All the Boys I've Loved Before (film)|To All the Boys I've Loved Before]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"CondorCollider\" /> [[Lee Smith (editor)|Lee Smith]] serves as editor for the film.<ref name=\"EditorSmith\" /> Visual effects were provided by [[Moving Picture Company|MPC]], MELS, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Rodeo FX]], [[Scanline VFX]] and Soho VFX, with Phil Brennan serving as the main visual effects supervisor.<ref name=\"VisualEffects\" />\n\n==Music==\nEvan Peters stated in January 2018 that [[Hans Zimmer]] was composing the score for the film,<ref name=\"Zimmer\" /> despite Zimmer having said in March 2016 that he would not score another superhero film following his experience working on ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.<ref name=\"ZimmerNoSupers\" /> Zimmer later explained that in conversations with director [[Ron Howard]] he was convinced to not keep a \"blanket\" view, and to focus on waiting for the right story rather than avoiding an entire genre. When Kinberg approached him at a concert to talk about his vision for ''Dark Phoenix'', Zimmer realized that the story was one that he wanted to help tell, and that the film was an opportunity for something that he had always wanted to try in a film score; he decided to join the production.<ref name=\"ZimmerExplanation\" /> In writing the film's score, Zimmer wrote new themes for the X-Men, Magneto, and the Phoenix, and chose to omit previously established themes written by previous composer [[John Ottman]].\n\nOn May 23, 2019, the track \"Extraordinary Being\" by [[Emeli Sand\u00e9]] was released as the official soundtrack.<ref>{{Cite AV Media |last=EmeliSandeVEVO |title=Emeli Sand\u00e9 - Extraordinary Being \u2013 In Collaboration with X-Men: Dark Phoenix |date=May 23, 2019 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnYsk7jfUTE |via= [[YouTube]] |access-date=May 27, 2019}}</ref> The soundtrack was released digitally on June 7.

A co-production of the United States and Canada, the film stars [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Andrea Riseborough]], [[Linus Roache]], [[Ned Dennehy]], [[Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9]], [[Richard Brake]], and [[Bill Duke]]. The film follows Red Miller (Cage) as he takes revenge on a [[hippie]] cult who murdered his wife. It premiered at the [[2018 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 19, and was theatrically released on September 14, 2018 by [[RLJE Films]]. ''Mandy'' was praised for its style and originality, Cage's performance, Cosmatos' direction, and the action sequences. It is one of the last films scored by Icelandic composer [[J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson]], who died in February 2018. The film is dedicated to him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/columns/johann-johannsson-cinema-soundscape-1202694619/|title=How Composer J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannsson Helped Change the Genre Cinema Soundscape|last = Debruge|first = Peter|date = February 10, 2018|work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|access-date = March 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nSomewhere near the [[Shadow Mountains]] in the year 1983, Red Miller lives with his girlfriend, artist Mandy Bloom, in a cabin near the lake. Red works as a logger, while Mandy has a day job as a cashier at a nearby gas station in the woods. She creates elaborate [[fantasy art]], and Red admires her work greatly. They lead a quiet and reclusive life, and their conversations and behavior hint at a complicated past and psychological hardship. Red appears to be a recovering alcoholic and possible veteran, and Mandy recounts traumatic childhood experiences.\n\nOn her way to work, Mandy walks past a van carrying the Children of the New Dawn, a deviant [[hippie]] [[cult]] led by Jeremiah Sand. Sand is struck by Mandy's beauty and orders one of his disciples, Brother Swan, to kidnap Mandy with the help of the Black Skulls, a demonic biker gang with a taste for human flesh and a liquid, highly potent form of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].\n\nAt night, Swan drives out to the lake and summons the Black Skulls by blowing a mystical horn. After Swan offers them a low-ranking member of the cult as a sacrifice, they break into the couple's home and subdue Mandy and Red. The two female members of the cult, Mother Marlene and Sister Lucy, drug Mandy with LSD and venom from a [[Sphex pensylvanicus|giant black wasp]] before presenting her to Sand. Sand \u2013 a failed musician \u2013 attempts to seduce Mandy with his [[psychedelic folk]] music, telling her that God had told him to take anything he wanted. Mandy ridicules him, leaving him confused and infuriated. Seeking revenge, Sand stabs Red, who is tied and gagged with barbed wire, then burns Mandy alive in front of him. After nothing but ash remains of Mandy, Sand and his followers leave. Red frees himself, mourns over Mandy's ashes, goes back inside, and falls asleep, exhausted and in shock. After waking up from a nightmare, he consumes a bottle of vodka, tends to his wounds, and shrieks in agony, grief, and rage.\n\nIn the morning, Red fetches \"the reaper,\" his crossbow, from his friend Caruthers. Caruthers provides him with freshly crafted arrows and information on the Black Skulls. According to Caruthers, the Black Skulls were drug couriers who turned murderously [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] after they had consumed a bad batch of LSD. Before Red leaves, Caruthers warns him that his odds of survival are poor. Red forges a battle axe and hunts down the bikers. Tracking the gang, he attempts to runs down and kills a trailing biker but is captured in the process. At their hideout, Red manages to break free and kill the bikers. In searching their hideout, he consumes some of their cocaine and tainted LSD, causing him to instantly and severely [[Hallucination|hallucinate]].\n\nSeeking out a radio tower he envisioned earlier, Red encounters The Chemist, a mysterious drug manufacturer, who tells him where to find the Children of the New Dawn. At their makeshift wooden church in a quarry, Red kills Brothers Swan and Hanker with his axe and kills Brother Klopek in a chainsaw duel, sparing only the life of Sister Lucy. Traversing the tunnels beneath the church, Red finds Mother Marlene and decapitates her. He then finds Sand, taunting him by rolling out Marlene's severed head. Sand begs for mercy, but Red kills him by crushing his skull. He sets the church on fire and watches Sand's body burn before driving away, envisioning Mandy in the passenger seat of his car, while the landscape behind him now appears fantastical and otherworldly.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Nicolas Cage]] as Red Miller<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\">{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3478741/mandy-poster-promises-nicolas-cage-chainsaw-battle/|title=The \u2018Mandy\u2019 Poster Promises a Nicolas Cage Chainsaw Battle!|last=Miska |first=Brad|date=January 16, 2018|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref>\n*[[Andrea Riseborough]] as Mandy Bloom<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" />\n*[[Linus Roache]] as Jeremiah Sand<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" /> \t\n*[[Bill Duke]]<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" /> as Caruthers\n*[[Richard Brake]] as The Chemist<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" />\n*[[Ned Dennehy]] as Brother Swan<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" />\n*[[Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9]] as Mother Marlene<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" />\n*Hayley Saywell as Sis<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shockya.com/news/2018/01/19/mandy-boy-girl-dream-love-election-night-sundance-film-festival/ |title=Mandy and A Boy.

Red works as a logger, while Mandy has a day job as a cashier at a nearby gas station in the woods. She creates elaborate [[fantasy art]], and Red admires her work greatly. They lead a quiet and reclusive life, and their conversations and behavior hint at a complicated past and psychological hardship. Red appears to be a recovering alcoholic and possible veteran, and Mandy recounts traumatic childhood experiences.\n\nOn her way to work, Mandy walks past a van carrying the Children of the New Dawn, a deviant [[hippie]] [[cult]] led by Jeremiah Sand. Sand is struck by Mandy's beauty and orders one of his disciples, Brother Swan, to kidnap Mandy with the help of the Black Skulls, a demonic biker gang with a taste for human flesh and a liquid, highly potent form of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].\n\nAt night, Swan drives out to the lake and summons the Black Skulls by blowing a mystical horn. After Swan offers them a low-ranking member of the cult as a sacrifice, they break into the couple's home and subdue Mandy and Red. The two female members of the cult, Mother Marlene and Sister Lucy, drug Mandy with LSD and venom from a [[Sphex pensylvanicus|giant black wasp]] before presenting her to Sand. Sand \u2013 a failed musician \u2013 attempts to seduce Mandy with his [[psychedelic folk]] music, telling her that God had told him to take anything he wanted. Mandy ridicules him, leaving him confused and infuriated. Seeking revenge, Sand stabs Red, who is tied and gagged with barbed wire, then burns Mandy alive in front of him. After nothing but ash remains of Mandy, Sand and his followers leave. Red frees himself, mourns over Mandy's ashes, goes back inside, and falls asleep, exhausted and in shock. After waking up from a nightmare, he consumes a bottle of vodka, tends to his wounds, and shrieks in agony, grief, and rage.\n\nIn the morning, Red fetches \"the reaper,\" his crossbow, from his friend Caruthers. Caruthers provides him with freshly crafted arrows and information on the Black Skulls. According to Caruthers, the Black Skulls were drug couriers who turned murderously [[Sadomasochism|sadomasochistic]] after they had consumed a bad batch of LSD. Before Red leaves, Caruthers warns him that his odds of survival are poor. Red forges a battle axe and hunts down the bikers. Tracking the gang, he attempts to runs down and kills a trailing biker but is captured in the process. At their hideout, Red manages to break free and kill the bikers. In searching their hideout, he consumes some of their cocaine and tainted LSD, causing him to instantly and severely [[Hallucination|hallucinate]].\n\nSeeking out a radio tower he envisioned earlier, Red encounters The Chemist, a mysterious drug manufacturer, who tells him where to find the Children of the New Dawn. At their makeshift wooden church in a quarry, Red kills Brothers Swan and Hanker with his axe and kills Brother Klopek in a chainsaw duel, sparing only the life of Sister Lucy. Traversing the tunnels beneath the church, Red finds Mother Marlene and decapitates her. He then finds Sand, taunting him by rolling out Marlene's severed head. Sand begs for mercy, but Red kills him by crushing his skull. He sets the church on fire and watches Sand's body burn before driving away, envisioning Mandy in the passenger seat of his car, while the landscape behind him now appears fantastical and otherworldly.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Nicolas Cage]] as Red Miller<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\">{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3478741/mandy-poster-promises-nicolas-cage-chainsaw-battle/|title=The \u2018Mandy\u2019 Poster Promises a Nicolas Cage Chainsaw Battle!|last=Miska |first=Brad|date=January 16, 2018|website=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref>\n*[[Andrea Riseborough]] as Mandy Bloom<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" />\n*[[Linus Roache]] as Jeremiah Sand<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" /> \t\n*[[Bill Duke]]<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" /> as Caruthers\n*[[Richard Brake]] as The Chemist<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" />\n*[[Ned Dennehy]] as Brother Swan<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" />\n*[[Olwen Fou\u00e9r\u00e9]] as Mother Marlene<ref name=\"Bloodydisgusting1\" />\n*Hayley Saywell as Sis<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shockya.com/news/2018/01/19/mandy-boy-girl-dream-love-election-night-sundance-film-festival/ |title=Mandy and A Boy.

She won the inofficial national youth championships, Colgate Cup, in three different levels, as a 12-, 14-, and 16-year old.\n\nIn 1981, only 15 years of age, she sensationally won the Swedish International Amateur Stroke-Play Championship, one of three major amateur tournaments in Sweden at the time, at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping Golf Club, with a record aggregate of 280 and a 9-stroke margin. At the time of her triumph, she wasn't even qualified for the Swedish national junior team, which, the same summer, won the European Lady Junior's Team Championship. The year after, she successfully defended her stroke-play title and,16 years old, was a member of the national team at the [[Espirito Santo Trophy]] in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1983, she finished second in Orange Bowl International Junior Championship in [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]], [[Florida]]. In 1984, she was the Swedish Match Play champion, member of the winning Swedish team at the European Lady Junior's Team Championship at Campo de Golf El Saler, [[Valencia]], [[Spain]], and medalist at the 36-hole qualifying competition in the [[European Ladies' Team Championship|European Ladies Team Championship]], in [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], [[Belgium]].

She also finished second five times in three other major championships.\n\nHer best finish on the LPGA Tour money list is third in [[1994 LPGA Tour|1994]].

She won four times in [[Japan]] and the 1995 [[Holden Women's Australian Open|Women's Australian Open]]. Her victory in the 1994 [[Women's British Open|Women\u2019s British Open]] made her the fifth player to win both British and U.S. Open titles, joining [[Laura Davies]], [[Jane Geddes]], [[Betsy King]] and [[Patty Sheehan]]. This accomplishment was later also achieved by [[Alison Nicholas]], [[Pak Se-ri]], [[Karrie Webb]], [[Inbee Park]] and [[Ariya Jutanugarn]]. In [[1994 Ladies European Tour|1994]] Neumann topped the LET Order of Merit, was voted ''[[Golf World]]'''s Most Improved Golfer and awarded [[Swedish Golfer of the Year]] for the third time.\n\nNeumann played in the European [[Solheim Cup]] team against United States, six times in a row, [[1990 Solheim Cup|1990]], [[1992 Solheim Cup|1992]], [[1994 Solheim Cup|1994]], [[1996 Solheim Cup|1996]], [[1998 Solheim Cup|1998]], and [[2000 Solheim Cup|2000]]. She captained the team to victory in August, [[2013 Solheim Cup|2013]] at [[Colorado Golf Club]] in [[Parker, Colorado]], the first time team Europe won the cup on foreign soil, and the first time Europe won consecutive cups. Neumann won the [[Women's World Cup of Golf]] for Sweden in 2006 with [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]].\n\nShe was recognized during the LPGA\u2019s 50th Anniversary in 2000 as one of the LPGA\u2019s top 50

When she recorded her first professional win, by claiming the [[1988 U.S. Women's Open Golf Championship|1988 U.S. Women's Open]] title, Neumann also became the first Swedish golfer, male or female, to win a [[Women's major golf championships|major championship]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.svenskgolf.se/artiklar/tournytt/20170918/har-ar-alla-svenska-majorvinnare/ |title=H\u00e4r \u00e4r alla svenska majorvinnare |magazine=Svensk Golf |first=CM |last=Hellsten |date=18 September 2017 |trans-title=Here are all Swedish major winners |language=Swedish |accessdate=15 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early years and amateur career==\nNeumann was born and grew up in [[Finsp\u00e5ng]], [[Sweden]], begun playing golf at the local 9-hole course and show early promise. She won the inofficial national youth championships, Colgate Cup, in three different levels, as a 12-, 14-, and 16-year old.\n\nIn 1981, only 15 years of age, she sensationally won the Swedish International Amateur Stroke-Play Championship, one of three major amateur tournaments in Sweden at the time, at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping Golf Club, with a record aggregate of 280 and a 9-stroke margin. At the time of her triumph, she wasn't even qualified for the Swedish national junior team, which, the same summer, won the European Lady Junior's Team Championship. The year after, she successfully defended her stroke-play title and,16 years old, was a member of the national team at the [[Espirito Santo Trophy]] in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1983, she finished second in Orange Bowl International Junior Championship in [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]], [[Florida]].

She won four times in [[Japan]] and the 1995 [[Holden Women's Australian Open|Women's Australian Open]]. Her victory in the 1994 [[Women's British Open|Women\u2019s British Open]] made her the fifth player to win both British and U.S. Open titles, joining [[Laura Davies]], [[Jane Geddes]], [[Betsy King]] and [[Patty Sheehan]]. This accomplishment was later also achieved by [[Alison Nicholas]], [[Pak Se-ri]], [[Karrie Webb]], [[Inbee Park]] and [[Ariya Jutanugarn]].
