In this description, the natural observables are connectivities of clusters, i.e. probabilities that a number of points belong to the same cluster. \nThe Ising model can then be viewed as the case <math>q=2</math> of the <math>q</math>-state [[Potts model]], whose parameter <math>q</math> can vary continuously, and is related to the central charge of the [[Virasoro algebra]]. \n\nIn the critical limit, connectivities of clusters have the same behaviour under conformal transformations as correlation functions of the spin operator.

The pine tree appeared even earlier on coinage produced by the Massachusetts Bay colony (the [[Massachusetts_pound|\"Pine Tree Shilling\"]]) from 1652 to 1682, a period of relative independence for New England during the [[Commonwealth_of_England|English Commonwealth]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Massachusetts Pine Tree Shilling, \"1652\" |url=https://amhistory.si.edu/coins/printable/coin.cfm?coincode=1_00&coinside=front |website=Legendary Coins & Currency |publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of American History |accessdate=28 July 2019}}</ref>   Leading up to the Revolutionary War the pine tree became a symbol of Colonial ire and resistance as well as multi-tribal support of Independence.\n\nThe white pine found in New England, specifically the eastern white pine ([[Pinus strobus]]) with heights exceeding 150 feet, was highly desirable for constructing masts in shipbuilding.  Twenty years after arrival in the new world, the Pilgrims harvested and exported these pines as far as Madagascar. Due to lack of supply of suitable lumber on the island, England reserved 24 inch (61&nbsp;cm) diameter trees under the Mast Preservation Clause in the [[Massachusetts Charter]] in 1691.  The trees were identified by a Surveyor of the King\u2019s Woods (a position of preferment) who would, in turn, appoint deputies to survey and place the [[broad arrow]] symbol on the tree from three hatchet slashings denoting property of the Crown. \n\nThe broad arrow statutes were not immediately enforced, due to England having access to other sources of timber in the Baltic.  However, when this source diminished, additional broad arrow policies acts were passed and enforcement increased in North America.\n\nThe statutes required colonists prior to harvesting trees from their property to have a King's Surveyor mark the larger diameter trees with the broad arrow and then purchase a royal license to harvest the trees not marked with the broad arrow.  The colonists resented the strictures on the timber used for their needs and livelihoods.  Prohibitions were disregarded and they practiced \"Swamp Law\", where the pines were harvested according to their needs regardless of statutes.<ref>http://ccrpa.org/km/King's%20Mark%20Why%20The%20Name%20King's%20Mark.htm</ref>\n\nIn New Hampshire enforcement led to the [[Pine Tree Riot]] in 1772, where a statute had been in effect since 1722 protecting 12-inch diameter trees.

In a letter dated October 20, 1775, Colonel Reed suggested a \"flag with a white ground and a tree in the middle, the motto AN APPEAL TO HEAVEN\" be used for the ships Washington commissioned.<ref name=\"uswacr\"/>\n\nThe following summer, on July 26, 1776, the [[Massachusetts General Court]] established the flag of the state navy with a resolution that stated in part: \"...that the Colours be a white Flag, with a green Pine Tree, and an Inscription, 'Appeal to Heaven'.\"<ref name=\"uswacr\">Wyatt, Rick (2002).

The pine tree appeared even earlier on coinage produced by the Massachusetts Bay colony (the [[Massachusetts_pound|\"Pine Tree Shilling\"]]) from 1652 to 1682, a period of relative independence for New England during the [[Commonwealth_of_England|English Commonwealth]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Massachusetts Pine Tree Shilling, \"1652\" |url=https://amhistory.si.edu/coins/printable/coin.cfm?coincode=1_00&coinside=front |website=Legendary Coins & Currency |publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of American History |accessdate=28 July 2019}}</ref>   Leading up to the Revolutionary War the pine tree became a symbol of Colonial ire and resistance as well as multi-tribal support of Independence.\n\nThe white pine found in New England, specifically the eastern white pine ([[Pinus strobus]]) with heights exceeding 150 feet, was highly desirable for constructing masts in shipbuilding.  Twenty years after arrival in the new world, the Pilgrims harvested and exported these pines as far as Madagascar. Due to lack of supply of suitable lumber on the island, England reserved 24 inch (61&nbsp;cm) diameter trees under the Mast Preservation Clause in the [[Massachusetts Charter]] in 1691.  The trees were identified by a Surveyor of the King\u2019s Woods (a position of preferment) who would, in turn, appoint deputies to survey and place the [[broad arrow]] symbol on the tree from three hatchet slashings denoting property of the Crown. \n\nThe broad arrow statutes were not immediately enforced, due to England having access to other sources of timber in the Baltic.  However, when this source diminished, additional broad arrow policies acts were passed and enforcement increased in North America.\n\nThe statutes required colonists prior to harvesting trees from their property to have a King's Surveyor mark the larger diameter trees with the broad arrow and then purchase a royal license to harvest the trees not marked with the broad arrow.  The colonists resented the strictures on the timber used for their needs and livelihoods.  Prohibitions were disregarded and they practiced \"Swamp Law\", where the pines were harvested according to their needs regardless of statutes.<ref>http://ccrpa.org/km/King's%20Mark%20Why%20The%20Name%20King's%20Mark.htm</ref>\n\nIn New Hampshire enforcement led to the [[Pine Tree Riot]] in 1772, where a statute had been in effect since 1722 protecting 12-inch diameter trees.  After being fined and refusing to pay for possessing trees marked with the broad arrow, a New Hampshire mill owner leading other mill owners and townsmen assaulted the Sheriff and his Deputy sent to arrest him by giving him one lash with a tree switch for every tree which the mill owners were fined, cutting the ears, manes, and tails off their horses, and forced them out of town through a jeering crowd.

With 17 albums to their credit and millions in sales, the Clark Sisters are the highest-selling female gospel group in history.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The early years ===\nThe Clark Sisters were born and raised in Detroit, Michigan to world-renowned gospel choir director and musician Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. Dr. Clark was married twice: her first marriage in 1945 to Leo H. Cullum, Sr. produced two children, Leo, Jr. and Jacqueline (Jacky).  After her divorce, she met and later married Pastor Elbert Clark in 1952. This marriage produced four daughters: Denise, Elbernita (Twinkie), Dorinda, and Karen. They each began singing at an early age in the choir at their father's church, and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. Shortly after the Clarks' divorce in 1973, Dr. Clark formally created \"the Clark Sisters\" and the sisters recorded their first album, ''Jesus Has A Lot To Give'', on their uncle (their mother's younger brother) [[Bill Moss (musician)|Bill Moss]]' local label Billesse Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jlentertainment.com/artistbio.cfm?artistname=The%20Clark%20Sisters|title=The Clark Sisters Biography|publisher=JLEntertainment.com}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, ''Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents the Clark Sisters'' was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as ''Unworthy'', ''Count It All Joy'', and ''[[He Gave Me Nothing to Lose]]''. By this point, Dr. Clark had turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who continued to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings. It was not until the early 1980s that the Clark Sisters began to become more widely known.{{Peacock-term|date=December 2011}} Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording ''Is My Living In Vain''. The first live recording by the Clark Sisters spent an entire year at number one on Billboard's Gospel Music chart.{{citation needed |date=September 2013}} Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\" was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on \"Speak Lord\" expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on \"Now Is The Time\". Another hit from this release, \"Expect Your Miracle\", is still a staple in African American churches across the country.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110045508/http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nTheir next release ''[[You Brought the Sunshine]]'' would prove to be a monster hit via the title track. Reminiscent of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s \"[[Master Blaster (Jammin')]],\" the song became a hit in churches and on dance floors, including New York's [[Studio 54]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prayzehymnonline.com/articles_80scountdown.html|title=80's Countdown|publisher=PraiseHymnOnline.com|author=J.

In 1983, the song peaked at #16 on the Black Singles chart, #27 on the Club Play Charts, and #80 on the Hot R&B Charts<ref>{{Cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2239/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Clark Sisters Chart History|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> driving the album to Gold sales. This album continues to display Twinkie's signature blend of scripture with unprecedented vocal and musical arrangements on biblically based songs like \"Psalms 31.\" The album's other songs include the sincere prayer found within the lyrics of both \"Center of Thy Will\" and \"Endow Me,\" featuring a young but already vocally mature Karen, as well as \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost\", showcasing Dorinda's vocal dexterity. The disco-inspired \"He Keeps Me Company\" is noted for its bubbly syncopation.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nThe sisters delivered another progressive effort in 1982, ''Sincerely'', which included \"Name It, Claim It\" and the politically charged \"World.\" Though its success was overshadowed by the previous hit \"You Brought the Sunshine\", the album received a Grammy Award nomination.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===More success===\nIn 1986, after a four-year gap between releases, the sisters: Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen (sister Denise left the group earlier that year) continued to release music, signing with [[Rejoice Records]], a division of [[Word Records|Word]].  This new deal yielded the Grammy-nominated ''Heart & Soul'' featuring the mainstream single \"Time Out\". This project made a top 5 debut on Billboard's Gospel Charts and garnered the group a coveted Dove Award. It featured the original versions of \"Jesus is a Love Song\", \"There is a Balm in Gilead\", and \"Pray for the USA\", which has been re-recorded several times. Although not pictured, Denise had contributed to the album before her departure. The music took on a more contemporary sound with programmed drums and synthesizers. Also included on this album were \"Smile, God Loves You\", \"Time Out\", \"I Am Blessed\", and the funky \"He\u2019ll Turn Your Scars Into Stars.\"<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1988, the Clark Sisters released their Billboard chart-topping and critically acclaimed album ''Conqueror''. It featured a bolder, more intense sound, with synthesizers, drum machines and more funk-oriented beats. ''Conqueror'' quickly became a fan favorite with hits like \"The Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\", \"Take Me Higher\", \"For the Love of the People\", \"Computers Rule the World\", and the original studio version of \"Jesus Forevermore\".<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1989, the Clark Sisters released their highly anticipated live album, ''Bringing it Back Home'', recorded in their home town of Detroit. It was the last recording from the Clark Sisters on Word Records\u2019 Rejoice imprint and the last group album with Twinkie just before the launch of her solo career. The album included both previous hits and new material. It featured guest appearances from gospel icon [[Rance Allen]] and backing choir vocals from the Michigan State Choir under the direction of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1994, the Clark Sisters released their last studio album before breaking grounds into their successful solo careers. Their last studio album of the decade, ''Miracle'', was the first album the Clark Sisters recorded without the songwriting and vocals of sister Twinkie. Produced by [[BeBe Winans]] & [[Michael J. Powell]], this disc features a very pop version of the Clark Sisters classic \"Expect Your Miracle\" (now titled \"Miracle\") and a remake of the classic \"Jesus is The Best Thing\". Dorinda made her songwriting debut on a Clark Sisters recording with \"Work to Do\". That album, although it fared well in sales, did not match the success of previous albums due to the Clark Sisters not being able to tour and promote the project, due to the illness of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, who died in September 1994 from diabetes complications.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===Emerging solo artists===\nFollowing their last Word Records release, Twinkie resumed her calling as a minister and her solo career. She had previously released two solo albums under the Sound of Gospel Record label: 1979's ''Praise Belongs to God'' and 1981's ''Ye Shall Receive Power'', both of which have become classics.  In 1992 she recorded her independent solo album ''Comin' Home''.  She re-appeared in 1996 with a pair of albums to her credit: the solo studio release ''The Masterpiece'' for [[Ben Tankard]]'s [[Tribute Records]] label and the live project ''Twinkie Clark-Terrell Presents the Florida A&M University Gospel Choir''.  She later released the following albums: ''Twinkie Clark & Friends: Live in Charlotte'' in 2002, ''Home Once Again: Live in Detroit'' in 2004, ''With Humility'' in 2011, ''Live & Unplugged'' in 2015, and with her nephew Larry Clark (her sister Denise's oldest son) ''The Generations'' in 2020. \n\nKaren delivered her solo debut ''[[Finally Karen (album)|Finally Karen]]'' in 1997. The album, featuring star turns from the Clark Sisters, [[Faith Evans]], and daughter [[Kierra Sheard]], was nominated for a Grammy Award, in addition to winning a [[Soul Train Lady of Soul Award|Soul Train Lady of Soul]] award. She has since released five more solo albums: ''[[2nd Chance (Karen Clark Sheard album)|2nd Chance]]'', ''[[The Heavens Are Telling (album)|The Heavens Are Telling]]'', ''[[It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)|It's Not Over]]'', ''[[All in One (Karen Clark Sheard album)|All in One]], and [[Destined to Win]]. ''\n\nDorinda released her self-titled debut solo album, [[Dorinda Clark-Cole]] in 2002, earning her two [[Stellar Awards]], and a Soul Train Lady of Soul award. She has since released four more solo albums: ''Live in Houston'' and ''Take It Back'', each of which have earned her the award for Female Vocalist of the Year at the Stellar Awards; ''I Survived'' in 2011, and in 2015, she released her fifth solo album, ''Living It'', which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album. \n\nJacky released her first solo project, ''Expectancy'', in 2005, which features the Clark Sisters on the track \"Blessing Me.\" In 2014, she released an urban inspired single \u201cMy Season\u201d followed by singles \u201cCover Me\u201d and \u201cShout\u201d. In February 2020, she released a single \"Feel Good\", featuring Mary J. Blige and rapper Tia P.\n\nThe Clark Sisters have all contributed in various capacities to each other's albums, whether they sang or wrote lyrics.\n\n===Live...One Last Time===\nOn July 8, 2006, the Clark Sisters (Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen) recorded a live album in [[Houston, Texas]] entitled ''Live...One Last Time''.

Drew Sheard, II.\n\n===Lifetime Movie and New Music===\nOn November 11, 2018, It was reported that the Clark Sisters would have a television biopic, ''[[The Clark Sisters: First Ladies of Gospel]].'' The film aired on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] on April 11, 2020. The film is executive produced by [[Queen Latifah]], [[Missy Elliott]], and [[Mary J.

Their first release in over a decade, features production from J. Drew Sheard, II, [[Warryn Campbell|Warryn Campell]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], Mano Hines, and [[Kurt Carr]], with a special feature by [[Snoop Dogg]] on the track, \"His Love\".\n\n==\"The Clark Sound\"==\nThe Clark Sisters are renowned for their vocal stylings, dubbed as \"the Clark Sound.\" They incorporate high and fast [[melisma]]s, acrobatic [[trill (music)|trills]] and [[riffs]], and deep, soulful [[growling|growls]], or \"squalls\". The sisters are also known for the individual distinctive sounds that they contribute. Jacky ([[alto]]/[[tenor]]) is known for her sweet, soft, smooth, and deeper vocals. Dorinda ([[alto]]/[[mezzo-soprano]]), the \"jazzy\" sister, inputs [[Scat singing|scats]], riffs, and runs with a fervency that places her in a class of her own. She has an innate ability to make each song her very own and she is a preacher to be reckoned with. Denise ([[soprano]]) was known for her high pitched, youthful singing voice and used her piercing soprano vocals, which are clearly heard on the group's first ten albums. She was also known for her runs and high melismas. Karen([[soprano]]) is known for her unique riffs, runs, growls, scats, very vast vocal range, ability to belt whilst in the whistle range, and has also been known to implement an \"echo\" in her live performances. Twinkie, credited with being \"the Heart of the Clark Sisters\", is known for her complex runs, riffs, powerful mixed-voice belts, soulful squalls, deep growls, and large vocal range spanning from high soprano to baritone--a range very few women have. One of the highest notes recorded by Twinkie came in one of the songs she penned, \u201cThe Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\u201d, hitting a powerful F6 (an F in the 6th octave). Early in the group's development, Twinkie was the chief songwriter, music and vocal arranger, and producer.\n\nThere is no single lead vocalist in the group. Jacky leads songs such as \"Wonderful Counselor,\" \"I've Got An Angel,\" \"So Much Joy\", and \"God Understands All\". Dorinda leads \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost,\" \"Time Out\", \"My Redeemer Liveth\", \"I Won't Let Go 'Til You Bless My Soul\", \"Determination\", \"Looking To Get There (Heaven)\", and \"Sanctify Me Lord\".  Karen sings lead on \"A Praying Spirit\", \"Hallelujah,\" \"Endow Me,\" and the Grammy-winning \"Blessed and Highly Favored.\" Twinkie leads on \"Nothing to Lose\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", \"Pray for the USA,\" \"I've Got The Victory\", and their biggest hit \"You Brought the Sunshine.\" Denise sings lead on \"Who Can I Turn To\", \"Something Worth Living For\", \"Count it All Joy\", and \"Christ is Born Today.\" She co-leads with her sister Twinkie on \"Holiness\" and \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing,\" and also with her sister Dorinda on the original version of \u201cThere Is a Balm In Gilead\u201d performed on local television shows, at concerts, and at Convocations before it was recorded on their album.\n\nThe group's sound and success have been highly influential on the contemporary genre of gospel music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theclarksisters.emigospel.com/news/|title=Lost redirect|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications\n!

The Clark Sisters are the daughters of gospel musician and choral director Dr. [[Mattie Moss Clark]]. They are credited for helping to bring gospel music to the mainstream and are considered as pioneers of contemporary gospel. Their biggest hits include: \"Is My Living in Vain\", \"Hallelujah\", \"He Gave Me Nothing to Lose\", \"Endow Me\", \"Jesus Is A Love Song\", \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\", \"Pure Gold\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", and their largest mainstream crossover gold-certified hit, \"You Brought the Sunshine\".

With 17 albums to their credit and millions in sales, the Clark Sisters are the highest-selling female gospel group in history.\n\n==History==\n\n=== The early years ===\nThe Clark Sisters were born and raised in Detroit, Michigan to world-renowned gospel choir director and musician Dr. Mattie Moss Clark. Dr. Clark was married twice: her first marriage in 1945 to Leo H. Cullum, Sr. produced two children, Leo, Jr. and Jacqueline (Jacky).  After her divorce, she met and later married Pastor Elbert Clark in 1952. This marriage produced four daughters: Denise, Elbernita (Twinkie), Dorinda, and Karen. They each began singing at an early age in the choir at their father's church, and by the late 1960s they were all performing together in church services, usually singing songs written and arranged by their mother. Shortly after the Clarks' divorce in 1973, Dr. Clark formally created \"the Clark Sisters\" and the sisters recorded their first album, ''Jesus Has A Lot To Give'', on their uncle (their mother's younger brother) [[Bill Moss (musician)|Bill Moss]]' local label Billesse Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jlentertainment.com/artistbio.cfm?artistname=The%20Clark%20Sisters|title=The Clark Sisters Biography|publisher=JLEntertainment.com}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, ''Dr. Mattie Moss Clark Presents the Clark Sisters'' was released and people around Detroit began to take notice of the group. The Clark Sisters signed to Sound of Gospel Records in 1974. Under this association, the group released albums such as ''Unworthy'', ''Count It All Joy'', and ''[[He Gave Me Nothing to Lose]]''. By this point, Dr. Clark had turned over control of the group to Twinkie, who continued to write, arrange, conduct, and produce all of the Clark Sisters' recordings. It was not until the early 1980s that the Clark Sisters began to become more widely known.{{Peacock-term|date=December 2011}} Their popularity soared with the release of the live recording ''Is My Living In Vain''. The first live recording by the Clark Sisters spent an entire year at number one on Billboard's Gospel Music chart.{{citation needed |date=September 2013}} Opening with the bluesy title track, each sister vocally declares that their dedication to Christ is not a useless effort. The innovative \"Ha-Ya (Eternal Life)\" was funky enough to find its way into a Tonex produced track over two decades later. Karen Clark's lead on \"Speak Lord\" expresses deep faith while the call to worship is raised on \"Now Is The Time\". Another hit from this release, \"Expect Your Miracle\", is still a staple in African American churches across the country.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110045508/http://www.theclarksisters.com/discography.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nTheir next release ''[[You Brought the Sunshine]]'' would prove to be a monster hit via the title track. Reminiscent of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s \"[[Master Blaster (Jammin')]],\" the song became a hit in churches and on dance floors, including New York's [[Studio 54]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prayzehymnonline.com/articles_80scountdown.html|title=80's Countdown|publisher=PraiseHymnOnline.com|author=J.

In 1983, the song peaked at #16 on the Black Singles chart, #27 on the Club Play Charts, and #80 on the Hot R&B Charts<ref>{{Cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2239/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Clark Sisters Chart History|publisher=Allmusic}}</ref> driving the album to Gold sales. This album continues to display Twinkie's signature blend of scripture with unprecedented vocal and musical arrangements on biblically based songs like \"Psalms 31.\" The album's other songs include the sincere prayer found within the lyrics of both \"Center of Thy Will\" and \"Endow Me,\" featuring a young but already vocally mature Karen, as well as \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost\", showcasing Dorinda's vocal dexterity. The disco-inspired \"He Keeps Me Company\" is noted for its bubbly syncopation.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nThe sisters delivered another progressive effort in 1982, ''Sincerely'', which included \"Name It, Claim It\" and the politically charged \"World.\" Though its success was overshadowed by the previous hit \"You Brought the Sunshine\", the album received a Grammy Award nomination.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===More success===\nIn 1986, after a four-year gap between releases, the sisters: Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen (sister Denise left the group earlier that year) continued to release music, signing with [[Rejoice Records]], a division of [[Word Records|Word]].  This new deal yielded the Grammy-nominated ''Heart & Soul'' featuring the mainstream single \"Time Out\". This project made a top 5 debut on Billboard's Gospel Charts and garnered the group a coveted Dove Award. It featured the original versions of \"Jesus is a Love Song\", \"There is a Balm in Gilead\", and \"Pray for the USA\", which has been re-recorded several times. Although not pictured, Denise had contributed to the album before her departure. The music took on a more contemporary sound with programmed drums and synthesizers. Also included on this album were \"Smile, God Loves You\", \"Time Out\", \"I Am Blessed\", and the funky \"He\u2019ll Turn Your Scars Into Stars.\"<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1988, the Clark Sisters released their Billboard chart-topping and critically acclaimed album ''Conqueror''. It featured a bolder, more intense sound, with synthesizers, drum machines and more funk-oriented beats. ''Conqueror'' quickly became a fan favorite with hits like \"The Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\", \"Take Me Higher\", \"For the Love of the People\", \"Computers Rule the World\", and the original studio version of \"Jesus Forevermore\".<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1989, the Clark Sisters released their highly anticipated live album, ''Bringing it Back Home'', recorded in their home town of Detroit. It was the last recording from the Clark Sisters on Word Records\u2019 Rejoice imprint and the last group album with Twinkie just before the launch of her solo career. The album included both previous hits and new material. It featured guest appearances from gospel icon [[Rance Allen]] and backing choir vocals from the Michigan State Choir under the direction of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\nIn 1994, the Clark Sisters released their last studio album before breaking grounds into their successful solo careers. Their last studio album of the decade, ''Miracle'', was the first album the Clark Sisters recorded without the songwriting and vocals of sister Twinkie. Produced by [[BeBe Winans]] & [[Michael J. Powell]], this disc features a very pop version of the Clark Sisters classic \"Expect Your Miracle\" (now titled \"Miracle\") and a remake of the classic \"Jesus is The Best Thing\". Dorinda made her songwriting debut on a Clark Sisters recording with \"Work to Do\". That album, although it fared well in sales, did not match the success of previous albums due to the Clark Sisters not being able to tour and promote the project, due to the illness of their mother, Dr. Mattie Moss Clark, who died in September 1994 from diabetes complications.<ref name=\"theclarksisters.com\"/>\n\n===Emerging solo artists===\nFollowing their last Word Records release, Twinkie resumed her calling as a minister and her solo career. She had previously released two solo albums under the Sound of Gospel Record label: 1979's ''Praise Belongs to God'' and 1981's ''Ye Shall Receive Power'', both of which have become classics.  In 1992 she recorded her independent solo album ''Comin' Home''.  She re-appeared in 1996 with a pair of albums to her credit: the solo studio release ''The Masterpiece'' for [[Ben Tankard]]'s [[Tribute Records]] label and the live project ''Twinkie Clark-Terrell Presents the Florida A&M University Gospel Choir''.  She later released the following albums: ''Twinkie Clark & Friends: Live in Charlotte'' in 2002, ''Home Once Again: Live in Detroit'' in 2004, ''With Humility'' in 2011, ''Live & Unplugged'' in 2015, and with her nephew Larry Clark (her sister Denise's oldest son) ''The Generations'' in 2020. \n\nKaren delivered her solo debut ''[[Finally Karen (album)|Finally Karen]]'' in 1997. The album, featuring star turns from the Clark Sisters, [[Faith Evans]], and daughter [[Kierra Sheard]], was nominated for a Grammy Award, in addition to winning a [[Soul Train Lady of Soul Award|Soul Train Lady of Soul]] award. She has since released five more solo albums: ''[[2nd Chance (Karen Clark Sheard album)|2nd Chance]]'', ''[[The Heavens Are Telling (album)|The Heavens Are Telling]]'', ''[[It's Not Over (Karen Clark Sheard album)|It's Not Over]]'', ''[[All in One (Karen Clark Sheard album)|All in One]], and [[Destined to Win]]. ''\n\nDorinda released her self-titled debut solo album, [[Dorinda Clark-Cole]] in 2002, earning her two [[Stellar Awards]], and a Soul Train Lady of Soul award. She has since released four more solo albums: ''Live in Houston'' and ''Take It Back'', each of which have earned her the award for Female Vocalist of the Year at the Stellar Awards; ''I Survived'' in 2011, and in 2015, she released her fifth solo album, ''Living It'', which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Gospel Album. \n\nJacky released her first solo project, ''Expectancy'', in 2005, which features the Clark Sisters on the track \"Blessing Me.\" In 2014, she released an urban inspired single \u201cMy Season\u201d followed by singles \u201cCover Me\u201d and \u201cShout\u201d. In February 2020, she released a single \"Feel Good\", featuring Mary J. Blige and rapper Tia P.\n\nThe Clark Sisters have all contributed in various capacities to each other's albums, whether they sang or wrote lyrics.\n\n===Live...One Last Time===\nOn July 8, 2006, the Clark Sisters (Jacky, Twinkie, Dorinda, and Karen) recorded a live album in [[Houston, Texas]] entitled ''Live...One Last Time''.

Drew Sheard, II, [[Warryn Campbell|Warryn Campell]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Jermaine Dupri]], Mano Hines, and [[Kurt Carr]], with a special feature by [[Snoop Dogg]] on the track, \"His Love\".\n\n==\"The Clark Sound\"==\nThe Clark Sisters are renowned for their vocal stylings, dubbed as \"the Clark Sound.\" They incorporate high and fast [[melisma]]s, acrobatic [[trill (music)|trills]] and [[riffs]], and deep, soulful [[growling|growls]], or \"squalls\". The sisters are also known for the individual distinctive sounds that they contribute. Jacky ([[alto]]/[[tenor]]) is known for her sweet, soft, smooth, and deeper vocals. Dorinda ([[alto]]/[[mezzo-soprano]]), the \"jazzy\" sister, inputs [[Scat singing|scats]], riffs, and runs with a fervency that places her in a class of her own. She has an innate ability to make each song her very own and she is a preacher to be reckoned with. Denise ([[soprano]]) was known for her high pitched, youthful singing voice and used her piercing soprano vocals, which are clearly heard on the group's first ten albums. She was also known for her runs and high melismas. Karen([[soprano]]) is known for her unique riffs, runs, growls, scats, very vast vocal range, ability to belt whilst in the whistle range, and has also been known to implement an \"echo\" in her live performances. Twinkie, credited with being \"the Heart of the Clark Sisters\", is known for her complex runs, riffs, powerful mixed-voice belts, soulful squalls, deep growls, and large vocal range spanning from high soprano to baritone--a range very few women have. One of the highest notes recorded by Twinkie came in one of the songs she penned, \u201cThe Darkest Hour is Just Before the Day\u201d, hitting a powerful F6 (an F in the 6th octave). Early in the group's development, Twinkie was the chief songwriter, music and vocal arranger, and producer.\n\nThere is no single lead vocalist in the group. Jacky leads songs such as \"Wonderful Counselor,\" \"I've Got An Angel,\" \"So Much Joy\", and \"God Understands All\". Dorinda leads \"Overdose of the Holy Ghost,\" \"Time Out\", \"My Redeemer Liveth\", \"I Won't Let Go 'Til You Bless My Soul\", \"Determination\", \"Looking To Get There (Heaven)\", and \"Sanctify Me Lord\".  Karen sings lead on \"A Praying Spirit\", \"Hallelujah,\" \"Endow Me,\" and the Grammy-winning \"Blessed and Highly Favored.\" Twinkie leads on \"Nothing to Lose\", \"Expect Your Miracle\", \"Pray for the USA,\" \"I've Got The Victory\", and their biggest hit \"You Brought the Sunshine.\" Denise sings lead on \"Who Can I Turn To\", \"Something Worth Living For\", \"Count it All Joy\", and \"Christ is Born Today.\" She co-leads with her sister Twinkie on \"Holiness\" and \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing,\" and also with her sister Dorinda on the original version of \u201cThere Is a Balm In Gilead\u201d performed on local television shows, at concerts, and at Convocations before it was recorded on their album.\n\nThe group's sound and success have been highly influential on the contemporary genre of gospel music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theclarksisters.emigospel.com/news/|title=Lost redirect|publisher=|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions, sales figures and certifications\n!

The squad is governed by the [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC) continentally, and [[FIFA]] worldwide. While Lebanon have yet to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], they did participated twice in the [[AFC Asian Cup|Asian Cup]]: in [[2000 AFC Asian Cup|2000]], when they hosted the event, and in [[2019 Asian Cup|2019]], the first time through regular qualification. Lebanon's main venue is the [[Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium]] in [[Beirut]], however they also play in other locations such as the [[Saida International Stadium]] in [[Sidon]].\n\nIn 1934, Lebanon played their first match against the Romanian side [[CA Timi\u0219oara]] (T.A.C.), but it was not ratified by FIFA. [[1940 Mandatory Palestine v Lebanon football match|Lebanon's first FIFA-recognized game]], however, was played in 1940 against [[Mandatory Palestine national football team|Mandatory Palestine]]. During their [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2014 qualification campaign]] for the World Cup, Lebanon reached the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification\u2014AFC Fourth Round|fourth round]] of qualifying for the first time thanks to a 2\u20131 victory against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] at home in 2011 but failed to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing at the bottom of that group. At the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup|2019 Asian Cup]], Lebanon were close to qualifying to the knock-out stages for the first time. However, they lost a tiebreaker to [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]] in the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup#Ranking of third-placed teams|third-place ranking]] on the fair play rule and were knocked out of the competition at the group stage. Lebanon also competes in the [[WAFF Championship]], the [[Arab Nations Cup]] and the [[Football at the Pan Arab Games|Pan Arab Games]]. As hosts, they have finished third\u2014once at the Arab Nations Cup and twice at the Pan Arab Games.\n\nInspired by their [[Cedrus libani|national symbol]], the Lebanese team is known as \"the Cedars\" ({{lang-ar|\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632}}) by fans and media. Their home kit is primarily red and their away kit white, a reference to their [[Flag of Lebanon|national flag]].

football]] since their inception in 1933. The squad is governed by the [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC) continentally, and [[FIFA]] worldwide. While Lebanon have yet to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], they did participated twice in the [[AFC Asian Cup|Asian Cup]]: in [[2000 AFC Asian Cup|2000]], when they hosted the event, and in [[2019 Asian Cup|2019]], the first time through regular qualification. Lebanon's main venue is the [[Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium]] in [[Beirut]], however they also play in other locations such as the [[Saida International Stadium]] in [[Sidon]].\n\nIn 1934, Lebanon played their first match against the Romanian side [[CA Timi\u0219oara]] (T.A.C.), but it was not ratified by FIFA. [[1940 Mandatory Palestine v Lebanon football match|Lebanon's first FIFA-recognized game]], however, was played in 1940 against [[Mandatory Palestine national football team|Mandatory Palestine]]. During their [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2014 qualification campaign]] for the World Cup, Lebanon reached the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification\u2014AFC Fourth Round|fourth round]] of qualifying for the first time thanks to a 2\u20131 victory against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] at home in 2011 but failed to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing at the bottom of that group. At the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup|2019 Asian Cup]], Lebanon were close to qualifying to the knock-out stages for the first time. However, they lost a tiebreaker to [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]] in the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup#Ranking of third-placed teams|third-place ranking]] on the fair play rule and were knocked out of the competition at the group stage. Lebanon also competes in the [[WAFF Championship]], the [[Arab Nations Cup]] and the [[Football at the Pan Arab Games|Pan Arab Games]]. As hosts, they have finished third\u2014once at the Arab Nations Cup and twice at the Pan Arab Games.\n\nInspired by their [[Cedrus libani|national symbol]], the Lebanese team is known as \"the Cedars\" ({{lang-ar|\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632}}) by fans and media.

The Indianapolis Journal described the CAA team as a machine, and gave credit to Brown, Slater, Camp, Hadden and Coffeen for good runs.

Camp would not attend the trip East due to ill health.  Another important event to note is the football teams of Rush Medical College and Lake Forest combining for the remainder of the 1895 season.  Rush would bolster the Lake Forest ranks, while also attempting Lake Forest's reportedly impossible schedule of [[1895 Northwestern Purple football team|Northwestern]], [[1895 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], and [[1895 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]], who at the time had a combined record of 9-3, with Michigan undefeated.  Lake Forest had also just come from contests between the likes of [[1895 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] and [[1895 Chicago Maroons football team|Chicago]], who had beaten them 52 to 0 and 26 to 5 respectively.  They had even lost to the minor team Amour, 6 to 0, and so when a merger was proposed between them and Rush, the agreement was made.

Blaney attained another touchdown at the beginning of the next half, with Thomas also scoring the last touchdown, and Brown rounding out the score to 30 with his impeccable kicking.

With 10 seconds remaining, it was still Chicago's possession, and with one last shove at the Newton Defensive Line, Full Back Brown rolled into the endzone over a mass of players, achieving a walk-off touchdown and subsequent PAT.  The game could've been won in the first half, had Chicago AA not fumbled on the Newton AC 4 yard line, but besides that the game was close and both sides held up well.  Stevenson was the center of attention for the Athletics, holding the line firm and knocking back Newton's star player,Mr. Draper, numerous times throughout the contest.

The two teams were in poor condition, but MIT was worse, having six substitutes starting, instead of their more experienced players.  The football teams had also played a tie game in 1894, where both organizations were in their prime.  Slater was yet again a star player, pulling off 3 touchdowns, while Hadden played well in his new Right Tackle position, and scored 3 touchdowns himself.  Brown also had a great day, going 7 for 8 in PATs, with 2 touchdowns of his own.  Other players that put points on the board for CAA was Thomas with two and Huddelston with one.  With 4 minutes left to play the game was called, as MIT had absolutely no chance of recovering the deficit, and were thoroughly defeated.\n\n'''October 31st-''' The Philadelphia Inquirer named Chicago AA,\"strongest eleven in the west, college or otherwise.\"  The game against Penn decided to be at 3:00 in the afternoon, with an admission of 50 cents, and an extra 25 for reserved seating.  It would be played at Penn's own [[Franklin Field]], on the corner of 33rd and spruce streets.  The last time the Chicago Athletic Association played the Pennsylvania Quakers, it was 1892, and the situation at hand was remarkably similar to that of the 1895 contest.  Penn was 10-0, having shut out 9 and outscored their opponents 349 to 6.

CAA came into this prime matchup 6-1, while outscoring their opponents 142 to 8, and recording 6 shutouts.  Penn on the other hand, was 10-0, having shut out '''all ten opponents,''' and outscoring them 370 to 0.  They had won the last 22 contests they had played in, 19 being shutouts, and had not lost a contest since November 30th, 1893, against the [[1893 Harvard Crimson football team|Harvard Crimson]]. The game was actually considered a success for the CAA, as it was the first points scored against the Eastern school in their 1895 season.  Chicago AA was also the first team in the 1895 season to tie Penn at some point in the game (besides a 0-0 tie of course, as every contest starts off with both teams tied at 0), when Slater managed to score on Quakers, 4-4, midway through the 2nd half.  The Penn team was so beaten up by the semi-pros, John C. Bell, head of the University football committee, took out his Penn players in the fear that too many players would get injured.  Seeing as the score was still tied 4 to 4, he eventually let his players back in, where they would score two unanswered touchdowns for the final 4 to 12 score.  Penn was furious after the game, and on November 7th, they officially declared that the school would never play another athletic club, association, or non-collegiate team again, cancelling their 1895 matchup against undefeated Boston AA. The University juggernauts would end the season 14-0, and were declared national champions by the [[Billingsley Report]], [[Helms Athletic Foundation]], [[Houlgate System]], [[National Championship Foundation]], and co-national champions with [[1895 Yale Bulldogs football team|Yale]] by well-known football historian [[Parke H. Davis]] (all retroactively).\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association roster.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

Camp would not attend the trip East due to ill health.  Another important event to note is the football teams of Rush Medical College and Lake Forest combining for the remainder of the 1895 season.  Rush would bolster the Lake Forest ranks, while also attempting Lake Forest's reportedly impossible schedule of [[1895 Northwestern Purple football team|Northwestern]], [[1895 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], and [[1895 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]], who at the time had a combined record of 9-3, with Michigan undefeated.

They had even lost to the minor team Amour, 6 to 0, and so when a merger was proposed between them and Rush, the agreement was made.

Blaney attained another touchdown at the beginning of the next half, with Thomas also scoring the last touchdown, and Brown rounding out the score to 30 with his impeccable kicking.

Under the watchful eyes of 2800 spectators, CAA had the ball on Newton's 5 yard line, with 35 seconds to go.  First, second, and third down went by with no gain for the Chicago AA Eleven.  With 10 seconds remaining, it was still Chicago's possession, and with one last shove at the Newton Defensive Line, Full Back Brown rolled into the endzone over a mass of players, achieving a walk-off touchdown and subsequent PAT.  The game could've been won in the first half, had Chicago AA not fumbled on the Newton AC 4 yard line, but besides that the game was close and both sides held up well.  Stevenson was the center of attention for the Athletics, holding the line firm and knocking back Newton's star player,Mr. Draper, numerous times throughout the contest.  Brown also had a good game, and Bartl got injured.  <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49425460/chicago-athletes-win-their-game-at/|title=Chicago Athletes Win Their Game at Newton, Mass, 4 To 0.|date=1895-10-27|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2020-04-24|pages=6}}</ref>\n\n===October 29: CAA at MIT===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= CAA vs MIT\n|Visitor= Chicago AA\n|Host= MIT\n|V1=24|V2=22\n|H1=0|H2=0\n|Date= October 29, 1895\n|Location= Cambridge, MA\n|TimeZone= EST\n|StartTime= 3:30pm\n|ElapsedTime= 40 minutes (two 20 minute halves)\n|Attendance= 500\n|Weather=\n|Referee= F.

The two teams were in poor condition, but MIT was worse, having six substitutes starting, instead of their more experienced players.  The football teams had also played a tie game in 1894, where both organizations were in their prime.  Slater was yet again a star player, pulling off 3 touchdowns, while Hadden played well in his new Right Tackle position, and scored 3 touchdowns himself.  Brown also had a great day, going 7 for 8 in PATs, with 2 touchdowns of his own.  Other players that put points on the board for CAA was Thomas with two and Huddelston with one.  With 4 minutes left to play the game was called, as MIT had absolutely no chance of recovering the deficit, and were thoroughly defeated.\n\n'''October 31st-''' The Philadelphia Inquirer named Chicago AA,\"strongest eleven in the west, college or otherwise.\"  The game against Penn decided to be at 3:00 in the afternoon, with an admission of 50 cents, and an extra 25 for reserved seating.  It would be played at Penn's own [[Franklin Field]], on the corner of 33rd and spruce streets.  The last time the Chicago Athletic Association played the Pennsylvania Quakers, it was 1892, and the situation at hand was remarkably similar to that of the 1895 contest.  Penn was 10-0, having shut out 9 and outscored their opponents 349 to 6.  Chicago lost that contest 10 to 12, but was the first opponent of the season to scored double digits against the Quakers.  \n\n\n===October 29: CAA at Penn===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= CAA vs \n|Visitor= Chicago AA\n|Host= \n|V1=0|V2=4\n|H1=4|H2=8\n|Date= November 1, 1895\n|Location= Franklin Field, Philadelphia, PA\n|TimeZone= EST\n|StartTime= 3pm\n|ElapsedTime= \n|Attendance=\n|Weather=\n|Referee= \n|Umpire= \n|Injured= \n|Linesmen= \n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\nCAA played rough, dirty in the eyes of some, as they lost to the superior university team of Pennsylvania, 4 to 12. CAA came into this prime matchup 6-1, while outscoring their opponents 142 to 8, and recording 6 shutouts.  Penn on the other hand, was 10-0, having shut out '''all ten opponents,''' and outscoring them 370 to 0.  They had won the last 22 contests they had played in, 19 being shutouts, and had not lost a contest since November 30th, 1893, against the [[1893 Harvard Crimson football team|Harvard Crimson]]. The game was actually considered a success for the CAA, as it was the first points scored against the Eastern school in their 1895 season.  Chicago AA was also the first team in the 1895 season to tie Penn at some point in the game (besides a 0-0 tie of course, as every contest starts off with both teams tied at 0), when Slater managed to score on Quakers, 4-4, midway through the 2nd half.  The Penn team was so beaten up by the semi-pros, John C. Bell, head of the University football committee, took out his Penn players in the fear that too many players would get injured.  Seeing as the score was still tied 4 to 4, he eventually let his players back in, where they would score two unanswered touchdowns for the final 4 to 12 score.  Penn was furious after the game, and on November 7th, they officially declared that the school would never play another athletic club, association, or non-collegiate team again, cancelling their 1895 matchup against undefeated Boston AA. The University juggernauts would end the season 14-0, and were declared national champions by the [[Billingsley Report]], [[Helms Athletic Foundation]], [[Houlgate System]], [[National Championship Foundation]], and co-national champions with [[1895 Yale Bulldogs football team|Yale]] by well-known football historian [[Parke H. Davis]] (all retroactively).\n\n\n\n\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association roster.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

[https://www.scribd.com/document/169838430/bernard-lewis 134]</ref> He also criticised Lewis' understanding of [[Osama bin Laden]], seeing Lewis' interpretation of bin Laden \"as some kind of influential Muslim theologian\" along the lines of classical theologians like [[Al-Ghazali]], rather than \"the terrorist fanatic that he is\". AbuKhalil has also criticized the place of Islam in Lewis' worldview more generally, arguing that the most prominent feature of his work was its \"theologocentrism\" (borrowing a term from [[Maxime Rodinson]]) - that Lewis interprets all aspects of behavior among Muslims solely through the lens of [[Islamic theology]], subsuming the study of Muslim peoples, their languages, the geographical areas where Muslims predominate, Islamic governments, the governments of Arab countries and [[Sharia]] under the label of \"Islam\".<ref name=\"abukhalil\" />\n\n===Debates with Edward Said===\nLewis was known for his literary debates with [[Edward Said]], the Palestinian American [[Literary theory|literary theorist]] whose aim was to deconstruct what he called [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] scholarship.
